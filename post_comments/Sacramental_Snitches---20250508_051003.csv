"Ignoring the law for a second, I cannot even imagine how difficult it would be to be a priest and have someone confess to ongoing child abuse",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-08T05:28:09,16
"Excommunication has always been the penalty for violating the Confessional.   If the law applies to EVERYONE, as in common people who find out that someone committed a crime and don't report it, then I am fine with the law BUT this one is being targeted at Priests ONLY... where is that Equal Protection under the Law and Separation of Church and State?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T05:15:21,20
"I understand many here are not religious, but very simply put, the laws of the Church are always going to trump the laws of man for the faithful.   I come from a protestant background, and the same standards apply. If the government rolled up and ordered me to tell them *anything* a fellow Christian told me in confidence that they strictly wanted kept between us and God, I would be in a non-impossible position - that request always trumps anything else.",squunkyumas,2025-05-08T06:14:50,5
The left cries for separation of church and state until it suits their purposes for the state to control the church. They seem to have it in for Catholics...Merrick Garland and his FBI persecuted Catholics as domestic terrorists. Organized religion is a threat to their control.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-08T07:41:33,5
"Admissions made during confession should have similar protections to attorney-client privilege.   A priest hearing an admission during a confession might consider encouraging the confessor to turn themselves in, or to otherwise discuss the crime in a setting that allows the priest to talk to the police.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-10T14:59:27,1
It would sicken me as well. The level of Faith in God is well beyond me.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T05:57:22,5
Also a Protestant here. Let’s flip the script. If a Mosque and its imam started demanding its members obey the Quran and subjugate non-Muslims and force them to pay a special tax  our government would put a stop to it. How is this any different? Just because something is a religious tradition (and in this case not even one that originated from Scripture) doesn’t mean our government’s hands are tied. Protecting its citizens is one of the few legitimate duties a government has and going after pedophiles is a noble goal. ,MulticamTropic,2025-05-08T10:13:15,6
Is doing something God doesn’t ask you to do really showing faith in God?,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-08T07:49:17,7
There's a massive gulf of difference between *discussing something in confession or a confidential conversation* and *engaging in something actively*.,squunkyumas,2025-05-08T10:16:28,2
Is forcing a single segment of the population to do something right as well?  What if the law said all black men who know about a crime must report it or be charged with colluding?  The fact that they are trying to force ONE part of the population to heel to their whims is the biggest problem.    Also what happened to Snitches get stitches?,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T10:28:31,-1
Your response to people not reporting sexual assault of a child is snitches get stitches?   You are 100% right the law should cover everyone you should be arguing this law doesn’t go far enough not arguing that it’s unfair for priest to diddle kids and not be able to cover up for each other.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-08T10:36:45,2
You need to read a little clearer... I was pointing out that people go by that. It was sarcasm. Sorry forgot to /sarcasm on that part. Thought people would understand based on what I am arguing FOR.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T10:38:36,-1
