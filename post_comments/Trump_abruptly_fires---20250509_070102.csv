I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume Trump is getting ready to destroy and censor a whole lot of books.,superanth,2025-05-09T07:12:16,34
"So, we can all agree that 1. She was fired because she is black, and they consider that DEI. And 2. They are about to destroy a bunch of document.",Tomrepo92,2025-05-09T07:17:13,26
Fired for being black.  Great.,NewsboyHank,2025-05-09T07:06:08,7
>She was the first woman and the first African American to occupy the role  Well... there's the problem right there. Obviously a DEI hire and needs to be replaced by a white man who's actually qualified.  /S,BlotchComics,2025-05-09T07:23:50,5
How can Trump fire the head of the Library of Congress? It's not the Library of the Executive.,TimothyMimeslayer,2025-05-09T07:40:17,5
"I hope these right wing activists are enjoying themselves, because when Trump-fatigue causes the electorate to swing center-left again, the dismantling of MAGA policies and the onrushing tide of 'wokeness' will have them wailing and rending their garments like Hebrew patriarchs.",Specialist_Heron_986,2025-05-09T07:33:08,11
"Just need to find a white, male, MAGA tool who has never opened a book in his life to replace her—should take about five seconds….",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-09T07:29:23,5
Trump is collecting millions of dollars from unregulated political donors.  CORRUPTION   Stop getting distracted,Alternative_Sir_8960,2025-05-09T08:18:00,4
I don't think Trump has read a book since college. Maybe magazines. Like Maxim.,kyreyz24,2025-05-09T10:45:36,3

She'll be back and hopefully with a nice pay day,CelticSith,2025-05-09T12:36:18,1
It would be fun if we started reporting this correctly. Trump illegally fires librarian of congress... etc,vagabending,2025-05-09T12:42:23,1
The library of congress is so much more than books.,rodentmaster,2025-05-09T07:29:52,23

He’s fired and shut down several independent agencies that he shouldn’t have the power to control.  I’m as baffled as you,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-09T08:26:44,7

True. It holds governmental records on a scale never before seen (I took the tour).  Having a Trump flunkie running it terrifies me.,superanth,2025-05-09T07:30:46,15

Agree…firing the U.S. Archivist and the Librarian means they can rewrite history as they see fit,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-09T08:31:54,11
">True. It holds governmental records on a scale never before seen (I took the tour).  I think you're remembering a tour of the National Archives and Records Administration, which is the repository for all federal records.  In fiscal year 2023, the Library of Congress recorded more than 178.2 million items in its collections, including:  more than 25.77 million cataloged books in the Library of Congress classification system  more than 15.99 million items in the nonclassified print collections, including books in large type and raised characters, incunabula (books printed before 1501), monographs and serials, music, bound newspapers, pamphlets, technical reports and other printed material  more than 138.5 million items in the nonclassified (special) collections, including:  4.3 million audio materials (discs, tapes, talking books and other recorded formats)  78.5 million manuscripts  5.8 million maps  17.5 million microforms  1.8 million moving images  8.2 million items of sheet music  15.7 million photographs  870,000 posters, prints and drawings  1.4 million other items (broadsides, photocopies, etc.)  2 million machine-readable items",JerriBlankStare,2025-05-09T18:40:00,1
It’s not just that. It means that they can prevent us from writing a proper history.,bloodoftyrant,2025-05-09T10:48:23,2
