"What good are education, foreign aid, environment, health and public assistance when you ramp up to take over the world? And calling it ""defense"" is really playing stupid by now. Or will you really believe Mexico, Canada and Greenland ""attacked first"" when it comes to it?",bytemage,2025-05-03T06:13:44,17

"“Defense” is going to mean domestic martial law if we don’t evict this bozo soon.    He’s asking for a 10x increase in ICE funding, including $20B for concentration camps.  The entire ICE budget last year was $4.5B and they were able to handle the entire job.   He’s directed the defense department to figure out how to help in domestic law enforcement.  Posse Comitatus  be damned, we’re going to have tanks in the streets and Predators patrolling the USA.",guttanzer,2025-05-03T09:44:09,10
"So cutting all the research, slashing Medicare, gutting the VA and countless agencies so we can take that money and put more of it to defense? Not even try to bring down the deficit?",hdiggyh,2025-05-03T07:01:04,7
Where is the peacetime dividend that Republicans were always talking about?,NAU80,2025-05-03T06:41:48,6
Look we have enough military might to destroy our next closest competitors multiple times over without even using nukes.  The only way this budget makes sense is in a military dictatorship.  ,Gator1508,2025-05-03T07:33:21,5

Qui bono?,bagjoe,2025-05-03T06:13:11,1
Soldiers don’t need to read to point a gun and be thrown into the meat grinder. Putin proved that. Fight the rich man’s wars or work the rich man’s factories never going above your social economic status as plebeians.,jayboker,2025-05-03T08:43:40,1

They've already been effected by the education cuts.,subjecttomyopinion,2025-05-03T14:30:34,2
"The dumbing down of America has been in play for years. This administration is just the final nail. We can't muster enough courage/energy to rally in the streets(with any significant numbers), let alone fight back physically. The military will just follow orders and in 2 years time(probably less), we'll be Russia 2.0. The game is over and once again the good in humanity has failed. I am culprit #1. Too worried about my own family to do anything meaningful.",Sufficient-Record695,2025-05-03T14:47:24,2
