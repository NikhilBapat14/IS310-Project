"Since you brought up Eli Salvador‚Ä¶ You are probably too young to have had a reason to learn about the expedited removal of illegal immigrants.   Bill Clinton (team blue president) signed the IIRIRA (team red congress) in 1996 which allows expedited removal of non-citizens without trial. An immigration officer is the judge/jury to make the decision.  The Patriot Act (almost unanimous team blue and red) effectively gave Carter Blanche to the executive branch to do whatever they want to a non-citizen once someone is deemed a terrorist.  Because of these two acts, which neither team red nor team blue seem to want to get rid of, there are roughly 100k of these non-trial deportations per year. The peak since 1996 was in 2013 under President Obama (team blue).  Do you agree or disagree that presidents should have this power?",willBlockYouIfRude,2025-04-25T17:09:57,-6
