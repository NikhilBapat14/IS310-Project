"I’ve noticed a pretty mega, major change since Trump won.  A crap ton of the left and anti Trump moderates in my orbit have started to roll their eyes at the constant stream of nothing burgers.   I’m talking about a surprising number of folks who are still strongly on the left, we’re all together at a BBQ and lefties who I thought would be red faced and barking like a dog mad at Trump, replying to “OMG Trump will end the world!” with - “Meh, we had him for an entire four years and none of the shit they told us was true”  It’s starting to almost get weird.  I’m not complaining!!",cliffotn,2025-05-05T21:12:10,6
