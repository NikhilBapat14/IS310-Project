"Conservative voters in Texas republican primaries were unaware that they were voting for pro-voucher challengers over anti-voucher incumbents.

It wasn’t really about that. It was about *beating down* the incumbent on that vote. And it didn’t turn into a referendum on vouchers. *No, no.* They saw that was a bad argument and wasn’t winning. So they switched. It became about ‘can’t be trusted on border security’ or ‘can’t be trusted on property tax relief’. When every one, *every one* of those defeated incumbents voted right down the line on border security and property tax relief. But voters were sold that was what this was about.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-03T08:53:52,3

"It provides $10k per year. I think the cheapest private school I’ve seen is $15k per year. So it’s discounts, basically.   I wonder about the realities of this in practice. For example, existing private schools must have enough spots for new students or, new private schools will need to pop up to accommodate those who wish to use their voucher.  It would take some time for new schools to pop up. If a new school pops up to take advantage of this voucher, can it sustain a school on $10,000 per student per year? I don’t think so. So is there an incentive to start up new schools? I am not sure.   Parents who I have talked to in the city that I live in in Texas, who are trying to put their kids into private school, are often talking about the application process, and the fact that many of these schools are already filled up.
