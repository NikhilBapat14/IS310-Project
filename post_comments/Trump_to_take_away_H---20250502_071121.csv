"MAGA is all whiny about imagined attacks on their right to free speech, but see no hypocrisy in attempting to shut down liberal (educated?) free speech.  Trump has proven conservatism is just the gateway drug to fascism.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-02T07:36:06,4
Donald Trump is transforming America into Russia.  Trump's third term and beyond is in the works.  Our democracy is almost dead.,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-02T07:39:33,4
Just in case people were wondering this is a felony. The only way to terminate their tax exempt status would be for the IRS to investigate it.   26 U.S. Code § 7217  https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7217  Not that people care if elected officials commit felonies anymore.  ,eskimospy212,2025-05-02T07:58:33,4

"And how many of the Republicans in the House, Senate, and their staffers went to Harvard? Traitors who aren't willing to stand up for what's right, much less the institution that educated them.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-02T08:03:56,1

"They have all the spine they need.  The problem with the ""grow a spine"" narrative is that it suggests that Republicans deep down want to do the right thing, but lack the courage to do so. I don't think that's true. They're enthusiastically on board with what Trump is doing. They're complicity is not because of lack of courage or spine, but because they agree.",Rannasha,2025-05-02T07:37:40,14
Never. They traded it for power a long time ago.,Erikblod,2025-05-02T07:18:11,7

"The dictionary definition of conservatism: preferring rigid class hierarchy.  Republicans spent their entire lives building a dictatorship. Yes, many privately agree it's the wrong dictator. Yes they will continue to enforce a dictatorship.  Get it?",kiwigate,2025-05-02T09:19:34,1
