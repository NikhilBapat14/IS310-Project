"Generally speaking, look up the office of the Secretary of State for your state, they handle voting, and have FAQs and contact info to answer all questions like this very reliably and with the precise law of your state.  If you're registered you should be able to vote in the coming main election, the primaries have long passed.  Plenty of people don't pick a party, the exact effects of not doing so vary by state, but you can always still vote in the general election.  It's not hard to change registered party between elections, I don't know what happens if you try to do it now when they've a lot of other stuff going on, not that it really matters much at this point since it only really matters for primaries anyways.",zlefin_actual,2024-10-23T14:09:57,1
"I'm fairly confident registering for a political party is for the party nomination voting which happened a while ago. Since parties are supposed to vote for who the main party candidate will be. So someone can't tamper/skew both political party voting.   Examples: Dems all go and vote for not Trump in the republican primary, so someone else becomes the Republican nominee.  All Republicans go vote in democratic primary for a weak candidate that their person can beat.",oiledupnik,2024-10-25T09:37:17,1
