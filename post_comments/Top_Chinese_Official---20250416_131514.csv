"First off, it's really bold to stand on 5,000 years of Chinese civilization when the country has been taken over by a Western ideology originally penned by a German ""peasant.""  Second, I think he's correct about at least one thing. China will not cave to a pressure campaign if they think they have the strength to come out on top, regardless of the damage it might cause them in the meantime.   Finally, I think his statement that this is not about their tariffs but about coming after their survival, is indicative of how the Chinese perceive this. I don't think they see this as ""just business.""",NiceSeaworthiness909,2025-04-16T16:40:50,23
"Some context here:  1) CCP has a view that the natural course of the world is for China to be at the center of it as the most civilized and advanced society. Certainly from 400 ad to 1500 ad this was objectively the case if it was the case for anyone, and they refer to their 5000 years of written history as an aspect of their continuity, achievement and inevitability. It’s also undeniable that they do have extensive culture.   2) one of their grievances is the humiliation of China by the west, especially the UK, in various unfair treaties that allowed opiates to be sold freely in China and other concessions too… really, bad deals in the 1800s and early 1900s especially. Ironic that they now export fentanyl precursors…   3) The ccp has pledged to the people of China that never again will they be humiliated by a bullying western power, which means they have to talk a ton of trash about Trump and America in this context no matter what even if they fully intend to make a deal otherwise they look like they aren’t holding to this promise   4) there’s some inherent ethno nationalism and Chinese superiority alongside all of this, keep in mind China is like 99.8% of one ethnicity in most of the country so this is like being a chiefs fan in Kansas City or an eagles fan in Philly or something, and everyone loves their own team. Their state tv regularly features stuff about how all sorts of good things come originally from China and so forth. Much of it is true too! Some, not so much.   This sort of talk is kind of referencing all of these points in the undertones. Ultimately they’ll make deals in their interest, but this is them doing politics to reinforce the themes that establish their governing legitimacy.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-16T14:55:18,32

Too bad this kind of nationalism doesn't exist in other places anymore. Thanks globalists.,Nianque,2025-04-16T22:40:21,5
I am very hopeful with ai we can automate these slave labor jobs. That will cripple China as long as we don't share or they can't steal the technology.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-04-18T16:37:56,1
