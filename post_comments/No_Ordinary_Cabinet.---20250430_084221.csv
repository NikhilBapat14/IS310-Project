The most unqualified administration in the history of the United States.,No_Size9475,2025-04-30T08:45:46,6
"President Trump’s critics look at his cabinet and see “a wannabe dictator and his toadies, Trump’s supporters see something else. They see a commander and his generals. They see warriors,” our columnist David French writes. “To understand why, it’s important to know exactly how the political right is defining strength, courage and — perhaps most important of all — gratitude.”  Read the full piece [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/30/opinion/trump-cabinet-members.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Dk8.Uxci.4OzqXStCdDQn&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription.",nytopinion,2025-04-30T08:42:29,2
"To his credit, Trump figured out why he failed in his first administration.  Much of his cabinet were traditional Republicans and they sought to control his impulsive behaviors.  There were adults in the room, with appropriate experience, and a vision of a role for government, just from a conservative viewpoint.  Trump is not a conservative Republican.  MAGA is quite different.    This cabinet was appointed without regard to qualifications, but with one main criteria - loyalty to Trump.  Show that, follow his directives, and you can maintain your position.  So this cabinet reflects the authoritarian goals of Trump and they will not provide any brakes on his impulses.  And if that won't come from Congress, and if the judiciary has no enforcement mechanism, the brakes are going to have to come from the American people.    With this understanding, and I think it's correct, this cabinet is perhaps the most irrelevant group we've ever seen in DC.  Souls have been sold, assuming they ever had one.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-30T09:05:42,2

"I'm pretty sure a literal filing cabinet would have done  a better job than Trump's cabinet.  At least the filing cabinet wouldn't share its secrets without a key, unlike Pete Hegseth.",SpenceW,2025-04-30T09:34:34,1
"The only reason to photograph these jackasses is if it somehow trapped them in the photo and we could send the pictures to the bottom of the ocean or something. Otherwise this reads like a fluff piece “bad people, but boy do they look good on camera.”",69DonaldTrump69,2025-04-30T09:45:54,1
