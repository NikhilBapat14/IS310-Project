"Did you know it cost Elon Musk $277 million in donations to buy his way into the White House?  And did you know it cost $356 million dollars to shoot the last Avengers movie!?  That means it was $79 million dollars cheaper for Musk to buy his way into a position with our President than it was to make a blockbuster film.   Oh...and another fun fact...Endgame has grossed $2.799 billion dollars world wide and created thousands of jobs through benefits like:  Direct Employment: The production of ""Avengers: Endgame"" directly employed a significant number of individuals in various roles, including actors, crew members, and technical staff.   Indirect Employment: The film's success led to increased revenue for related industries, such as film studios, theaters, merchandise providers, and tourism-related businesses, creating indirect job opportunities.   Stimulating Economic Activity: The global box office success of ""Avengers: Endgame"" contributed to a surge in economic activity, stimulating demand for goods and services and indirectly supporting jobs across the economy.   Worldwide Impact: The film's success reached global markets, leading to increased tourism, international distribution, and merchandising opportunities, creating additional job opportunities in these areas.   How many jobs has DOGE created?  We wanted Tony Stark but we got Justin Hammer.",36monsters,2025-05-05T23:44:32,10

"All right, I read that article. Seems Voight did a decent job of carrying out his task. He apparently consulted studio representatives and experts and put together a recommendation of limited tariffs in only certain situations in addition to other recommendations. And from what I understand Trump's sweeping 100% tariff is way more than Voight recommended. I guess Trump thought would impress someone by going even more extreme.  I really cannot believe that that crazy mean old fucker Jon Voight is doing a more measured and thoughtful job than the crazy mean old fucker that's the President of the United States. I used to laugh that Trump's celebrity friends are now down to Jon Voight and Kid Rock. Now I'm beginning to think that either of them would make a better president than Trump.",Jack_Q_Frost_Jr,2025-05-05T22:31:27,9

I dunno; I think that the anaconda that puked up John Voight showed pretty good judgement. But I guess that you can't have a snake as president of the USA.   Or can you?,FitWrap1959,2025-05-05T23:13:41,5
