They need a head on a spike outside the law courts to remind their maggot minions that everything they've said and they say about the courts being corrupt is true. And they have not an ounce of honesty or integrity to hold them back.,drop-bear-rescue,2025-04-30T06:40:17,2

"She didn't even commit a crime to begin with.  ICE had no judicial warrant on site, so they had no standing to be making an arrest in there to begin with.  She is not obligated to transfer custody of anyone over to  anyone else until she has a judicial warrant at the location in question (this being the courthouse.)  Information she acquired (warrant *attempt*) was in no way classified, she is free to share it as she pleases to whomever. Information acquired from ICE's inept attempt at using an administrative warrant to bypass the due process of the 4th and 14th amendments *in a judge's face no less* is not her problem.",Xezshibole,2025-04-30T12:52:17,2

"Didn’t she pretty cut and dry break the law? I think they’ll dismiss the case because it’s unpopular but it’s more of a pr stunt to tell people they could be next. However, the case getting dismissed on legal grounds doesn’t seem like a slam dunk.",True-Surprise1222,2025-04-30T02:30:41,-65

"Nope, not at all.  Local and state officials have no reason to acknowledge ICE without a warrant. If anything it is their constitutional duty not to collaborate with immigration officials, as foreign affairs like immigration are an **exclusive** federal duty. She would be infringing on federal jurisdiction by participating in immigration duties.   In places like Sanctuary jurisdictions this constitutionally correct delineation between federal and state/local is formally enforced. That said even outside said jurisdiction she would not be in the wrong to individually practice sanctuary policy, as she is a local/state agent, not a federal one.  Nevermind that even without that, just the 10th is enough. The 10th amendment ensures the federal government had no standing to force lower governments to collaborate. Given that federal doesn't offer much if any funding for any local/state immigration enforcement programs to begin with, there's little reason why any local/state should be investing its own resources over the matter.  Only way ICE or the military can rip the immigration suspect out of her or her courthouse's custody is if they have a **judicial** warrant, as **due process** demands under the 4th (search and seizure,) and 14th amendment.  On this matter ICE had no judicial warrant so they had no standing to arrest in the courtroom to begin with. Since they had no standing to arrest she wasn't obstructing anything. Furthermore their inept attempt to use an administrative warrant to bypass due process *in her face* (reminder that she is a *judge*) leaked information to her. Information she was free to share with anyone.",Xezshibole,2025-04-30T12:12:58,3
"Nope. It's just an executive branch mumbo jumbo meant to decieve people to forfeit their 4th amendment rights.  The admin warrant has no power as it was not issued by a neutral judge who has been given sufficient evidence to issue a warrant.  It is issued by someone from ICE because they said so.  There's no due process as required by the 4th and 14th. None that would pass muster in the courts anyways, given that admin warrants are effectively trying to bypass judicial authority.  It especially holds no power in local nor state property, in this case their courthouse, especially considering they're trying this nonsense on a judge of all people.",Xezshibole,2025-05-01T16:50:28,1

The fact she has been suspended is a fairly good indication it won't go well for her.,Delicious-Fox6947,2025-04-30T00:52:20,-42
That literally means nothing. All it means is she’s suspended pending the outcome. It’s pretty typical process.,Unhappy_Plankton_671,2025-04-30T03:02:18,23
If she didn't do anything worthy of a suspension she wouldn't be suspended.,Delicious-Fox6947,2025-04-30T11:45:57,-2
"Negative, suspension is because she’s had charges filed and can’t execute their case load. She’s been suspended from the bench and allows her cases to be redistributed etc.  It’s procedural. Nothing more.  Stop trying to assign guilt or an outcome to this when that has NOT played out and she still gets her day in court.",Unhappy_Plankton_671,2025-04-30T12:03:18,2
I don't need to assign guilt. She is guilty.,Delicious-Fox6947,2025-04-30T14:01:51,1
