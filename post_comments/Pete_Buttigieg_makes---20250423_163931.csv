">Going everywhere means seeking out audiences that may have never heard our message at all.  >That’s why I sat down for a two-and-a-half-hour conversation on the podcast Flagrant - a show that hosted Donald Trump during the presidential campaign last year.  >The episode was released today, and I’d encourage you to [check it out on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx7GvYSq64) or wherever you stream podcasts.  >I know that a podcast with an almost all-male viewership, which prides itself on rejecting political correctness and is skeptical of all things “woke,” represents an audience that might not be inclined to give my party the benefit of the doubt.  >That’s the point.  >I showed up and made the case for my values and for what I believe people across the spectrum should unite around, especially in this moment: that our republic should never let one man, or a handful of men, have too much power.  >One thing that is clear from the last election is that my side of the aisle must examine not only *what* we have to say, but *how* and *where* we say it.  >That’s why you can count on me to keep showing up - anywhere there’s a chance to have a real conversation with anyone willing to engage.  >https://petebuttigieg.substack.com/p/why-i-sat-down-for-a-two-hour-podcast",modooff,2025-04-23T16:46:26,21
"This made me very glad I don't listen to moronic conservative podcasts. Pete was awesome though, they seemed to respond well to him.",fenwayswimmr,2025-04-23T16:42:10,15
Fuck yes. This is what we need. Him and Walz should be doing some tour on these podcasts.,timbervalley3,2025-04-23T17:34:56,12
"It doesn’t hurt anything to do this, but the impact will probably be pretty muted. He’s going up against a hostile audience and for every appearance by him there will be a hundred anti-woke joyriders who know how to manipulate an audience appearing on these shows.",ennuiinmotion,2025-04-24T06:43:27,2
Ummm ok.  Just dont be a prop that says the left sill of the overton window must move right,KingThar,2025-04-23T16:45:52,4
Shulz is genuinely one of the most unfunny “comedians” in the Rogansphere. And there’s a lot of unfunny shit in that group.,timbervalley3,2025-04-23T17:36:29,8
"He didn't. Floated a wealth tax, paid parental leave, and the importance of regulation and green energy. Which the bros seemed to respond well to.",Icey210496,2025-04-24T15:43:27,3
Like Gavin F. Newsom?,Random-Cpl,2025-04-24T04:28:30,0
"Yep - don't get me wrong, I LOVE that Pete went on, very smart move. But Schulz is an absolute douche, it was hard to listen to him.",fenwayswimmr,2025-04-23T17:40:23,8
Same feelings here.  Side note- PB’s facial hair makes a lot more sense now haha.  Had to be a strategic manliness makeover?,timbervalley3,2025-04-23T17:43:22,5
"People keep talking about how he couldn't possibly win. I think if he keeps doing these platforms, and the response is positive from both the hosts and listeners, he has a very real shot.",fenwayswimmr,2025-04-23T17:45:13,4
