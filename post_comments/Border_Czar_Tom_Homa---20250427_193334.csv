"Eliminating the Anchor Baby Gambit would be almost as revolutionary as eliminating birthright citizenship. Almost.  The next thing you know, immigration to the U.S. might stop being regarded as a universal entitlement, and the U.S. might develop an immigration system that served U.S. interests, as opposed to turning North America into a global commons.",Phil152,2025-04-27T20:00:29,315
Birth tourism is extremely high in America. Every Korean friend I have in America got their citizenship via birth and then brought their parents over when they turned 18. It's a whole industry that the entire world uses.,No-Entertainer8627,2025-04-27T21:14:32,174
"To be clear, he is talking about ""Anchor Babies"" All those children were born of illegal mothers. Even when they had the opportunity to get a Marriage exemption to become legal, they would not take it.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T19:53:16,55

We need to change the laws to make it harder for them to bring their family over if they move back too.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T23:34:04,10
"My body my choice right? They chose to be here illegally, we choose to deport them. Their children can either go with them or go into foster care. ",GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-04-28T09:35:38,5
"Out of curiosity, what happens if the mother of an underage child (16 years old, for example) does NOT want to take the child with her?  Does the U.S. still require the child citizen to be deported with the custodial parent? If so, couldn’t the child just re-enter the country unsupervised?  Is there an age at which the parents are allowed to surrender custody (or leave the child unsupervised in the U.S.)?",_Eggs_,2025-04-27T21:25:54,15
Spot-on! I'm getting lambasted elsewhere for stating it's the parents' fault for putting their kids in this predicament. People who are here illegally should leave now or at least designate a guardian for their American-born children in the event they are deported.,Willow-girl,2025-04-28T06:58:00,5

"> Why isn't this beyond obvious?  Deport them with their children? OUTRAGE  Deport them *without* their children?  MEGA OUTRAGE  Imagine the absurdity of someone sneaking into the US, being caught (or not), being given a court date many years out (or not), having a child in the meantime and then claiming this cancels everything and they shouldn't be deported now.",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-28T08:49:27,49
It was obvious from day one of the presidency that these are the types of deportations mainstream news would be reporting on.,BarrelStrawberry,2025-04-27T22:02:46,66

You know what the big issue is? That when eventually the dems come back to power they will make up for the lost years by completely opening the gates.,dankhorse25,2025-04-28T00:33:19,70
The problem I see next is they often come back and bring the entire extended family instead of just themselves.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T23:35:07,24
"The parents are voluntarily taking their kids with, it seems stupid it's never been tried before.",hiricinee,2025-04-28T00:41:56,8

No shit. They shouldn't even be getting citizenship.,No-Entertainer8627,2025-04-27T23:38:12,67
"I mean, I understand what the possible solutions to that problem would be. But I'm curious about what the law actually is. I haven't found anything online about it, so I assume it's a family court thing (which is basically ""anything goes depending on the judge's biases and mood"").",_Eggs_,2025-04-27T21:48:19,10
"The biological parents should be blocked from entry forever. They not only broke the law, but they used their children as human shields to try to stay.",kaytin911,2025-04-27T23:36:49,11
"""Can't remove squatters if they have pets or kids.""  - Liberals, probably",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-28T09:54:30,20
I agree. The quickest thing we can do though is to stop people from being able to bring family over easily. It doesn't make sense and it stresses infrastructure severely. Anyone deported with an anchor baby especially should be barred entry forever. They purposefully brought a child into their mess to act as a human shield.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T23:38:57,31
