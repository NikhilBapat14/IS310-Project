The president of Mexico is excellent. She has great instinct. Mexico is lucky to have her.,frresh66,2025-05-04T16:42:42,32

The US is trying to take the Israel route. Cross the border in the name of “safety” level a whole town because “a cartel member passed by there last week” then annex the town in the name of “security” and keep doing it little by little,joystick-fingers,2025-05-04T16:50:31,15
"I've never known Trump to stop when a woman says ""no"" to him.",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-04T19:32:07,5
He will send the troops over there anyway.,nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-04T16:58:32,6
That's an act of war. Or as Trump would call it: A Special Military Operation. Fuck him.,williamgman,2025-05-04T17:31:26,3
"So, she rejected an invasion? Honestly, I would too...",lurkylurkeroo,2025-05-04T18:14:50,3
"This is tough, she definitely lives under a very real threat of assassination. It’s honestly a lose-lose, either stay under cartel influence and have some fucked killings, or have America come in and do what they do best, radicalise the locals and start a war killing far more than the cartel ever would.",iimwint,2025-05-04T18:21:23,3
Trumps plan ***to invade Mexico***.   Say it right! ,NickelBackwash,2025-05-04T22:46:47,2
Ya that's called invasion.,TheGreatGamer1389,2025-05-05T09:31:32,2
its like the way trump is doing things is making the entire world say no to him,saiyanscaris,2025-05-04T17:06:09,1
Nobody should be proud of this considering she’s only protecting their very real crime issue,Gheezer1234,2025-05-04T17:08:44,-10
You'll make the Mexican maga (derechairos) foam at the mouth. For them It's impossible that Mexican president do anything good at all,tedecristal,2025-05-04T17:50:01,9

She could arrest them and send them to el salvador...,utriptmybitchswitch,2025-05-04T16:46:56,6
"He will probably have some of his maga-morons create a fake crisis at the border and THEN send in the troops. What am I thinking? That would take strategy, planning, and execution.   lol…You are TOTALLY right!",RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-05-04T16:49:16,2
"If he invades a sovereign ally, ICC can put a warrant out on him. And the sovereign ally he'll be invading is a member nation of the ICC.  And knowing just how fucking dumb he is, he'll fly down there without realizing what any of it means.  So by all means, I look forward to the attempt.",TheRustFactory,2025-05-04T17:35:44,3
In what way?,papibigdaddy,2025-05-04T23:28:12,0
I see that most countries have at least one official psycho party of raving lunatics.,angryapplepanda,2025-05-04T21:04:45,8
Wasn't it investigated and found out that it was a forced training site?,TrueTorontoFan,2025-05-05T06:32:54,1
Not unless she's paying them as much as Trump is.,alabasterskim,2025-05-04T16:49:24,3
"I mean, the crisis is already manufactured. He claims we're under invasion. He can send them in right now and probably think ""they won't attack us! that would mean war!"" 3 seconds before they attack us and the entire world acknowledges the dumbass country that sent troops into its neighbor is the aggressor, not the one about to defend itself.",alabasterskim,2025-05-04T16:51:01,2
"Personally, I think he'd take them for free, then sell them back to krasnov for beaucoup bucks...",utriptmybitchswitch,2025-05-04T16:51:54,2
"Mexico does have a US manufactured crisis, it's US guns. Wilson center estimates 70 to 90 percent of guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes passed through the us (2024).   If the US wants to curtail drugs, stopping the export of weapons would go a long way.",Several-Pattern-7989,2025-05-04T20:53:19,0
Brilliant. Too bad she has that strange commitment to the law that prevents one from sending people to concentration camps.,alabasterskim,2025-05-04T17:05:20,4
