GOP: Hey look this guy has lost his mind like us.  Let's recruit him.  He will fit right in with our mental instability.  ,arilupe,2025-05-10T16:13:13,1

">“There needs to be space for Fetterman and for other senators in our caucus,” he said in an interview Saturday. “He still is a senator that fights for working-class people. We may not be 100 percent in agreement a lot of times in a lot of areas, but we don’t have to be.”  >While some Democrats have distanced themselves from Fetterman, top Republicans have rallied around him in the wake of news reports that his current and former staffers are concerned about his mental and physical health. Several GOP senators, including Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), have come to Fetterman’s defense on social media.  >Asked if Republicans are trying to tug Fetterman to the GOP, Gallego said “of course.”  >“In the Marines, we call these fuck-fuck games,” said Gallego, who traveled to Pennsylvania Saturday for a town hall.  >Fetterman has said repeatedly that he will not change parties. But that isn’t stopping some conservatives from trying to push him to vote for their priorities — and perhaps more broadly come onto their side. The Club for Growth, a conservative group, is airing a TV ad in Pennsylvania this weekend praising Fetterman as “standing up for every working family in PA” and urging him to back President Donald Trump’s tax cuts.  >During Gallego’s town hall, Gallego repeatedly stressed the need for Democrats to maintain a big tent. He was asked by a member of the audience why he did a fundraiser with Marc Andreessen, a pro-Trump businessperson. Gallego said he runs “the largest venture capital firm in Arizona.”  >“We got so pure that we started kicking people out of the tent — it ends up there aren’t enough people in the tent to win elections,” he said to applause.",Goosedukee,2025-05-10T15:53:45,1
"Fetterman needs to seek help... Real help. Amazing how fast everyone including MSM turned on Biden for ""suffering from dementia""... Yet they give Fetterman a pass just to keep the party intact??? He will never vote with dems again. It's over.",williamgman,2025-05-10T16:07:37,1

I agree there should be a law like this or at the very least it triggers a special election.,sedatedlife,2025-05-10T15:59:50,1

"To be fair, that twice worked to the Democrats advantage with Republicans switching to the Democrats or Democrat-aligned Independent in 2009 and 2001/02 respectively.",bootlegvader,2025-05-10T16:06:51,1

"A famous, white, mentally unstable man? AND he’s from a swing state. Dude’ll be in the fast track to 2028 GOP presidential nomination if he switches parties.",Gustapher00,2025-05-10T16:16:02,1

"We just had an issue of covering up health problems, we are very much on a situation where we have to be transparent. If we are going to try and claim to be the not corrupt party, we have to confront our problems, not cover them. We can support Fetterman while making it clear those are serious accusations that can't be easily dismissed. We cannot risk the war for this battle and need to separate ourselves from the muck. Biden's health issues are a huge black mark on the democratic party.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-05-10T17:15:54,1
No Ruben 90 million we’re apathetic & lazy. The tent is big enough.,Awkward-Slip1145,2025-05-10T16:49:03,1
"Hmm, if you don't have enough people in the tent to win elections, could it possibly be due to the ""for every voter we lose on the left, we'll pick up two on the right"" mindset?",snoo_spoo,2025-05-10T17:49:20,1

"We’re kinda at the point where the R or D generally decides your position on issues, people will vote along party lines even if they disagree with their own vote",HeadfulOfSugar,2025-05-10T17:23:01,1
"As the other poster said, their political party determines how they will vote 90% of the time. But maybe even more important than that, the party that each legislator identifies with determines who has majority, and therefore which party gets control of leadership positions **and** **committee assignments.** When you vote for somebody, you're not (or you shouldn't) only considering how they will vote on individual issues. Your vote also gives power to the party they belong to or caucus with.",Morlik,2025-05-10T17:59:40,1

"It works both ways. If a majority is on the line (it always is), and committees are important (they are), one could logically vote for a potato with their preferred party’s name attached than a competent person in the other party",coolideg,2025-05-10T17:50:54,1
