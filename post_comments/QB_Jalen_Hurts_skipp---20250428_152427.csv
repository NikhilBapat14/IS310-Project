"""Scheduling conflict.""  Yeah, like being anywhere else on earth.  So thankful my alma mater got their national title while Biden was still President, while our rival had their dumb alum tear up their national title trophy a couple of weeks ago, lol.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-28T15:40:03,37
this article is trash.  it ignores that Trump was booed out of the stadium literally.  of course the TV network didn't mic the boos but those in attendance who recorded could clearly hear it.      Fox should lose their license if we apply Trump's standard to media networks for misinformation      also saquon showing up for an extra Trump meet and greet makes him particularly heinous. No Trump is not the same as Obama. and he knows it. he just doesn't care about anyone but the wealthy now that he is wealthy. most classic story,ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T15:31:09,26
