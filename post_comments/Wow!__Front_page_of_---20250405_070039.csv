"We’re starting to see trickles of republicans and media starting to turn on Trump.  Fox News even stopped displaying a stock ticker, and basically was ignoring the crashing market yesterday.  They only do something like that when there’s no possible way to defend what is happening.",HereWeGo5566,2025-04-05T08:16:22,14
"Yeah, Trump admin is all peachy-keen in the WSJ.... right up until he starts fucking with the cash flow to the wealthy!",Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-05T07:40:00,17
Lock him up. Lock him up.,seaweeddanceratnight,2025-04-05T07:58:23,6
He's going to love that very flattering picture of himself.,BustAMove_13,2025-04-05T13:53:22,4
Bloomberg has also slowed their both-sidesing of Trump policy the past couple weeks. Lutnik and Bessent are not getting the benefit of the doubt anymore.,InternationalFlan732,2025-04-05T10:44:10,3
I watched a video of this as he was arriving at his golf course. He was saying “Let them eat cake”,45whiskeydude,2025-04-05T14:16:24,3

WSJ helped get Trump elected and has always leaned right. WSJ should go F* itself.,bakeacake45,2025-04-05T12:04:56,3
This whole presidency is as nerve-racking as the movie Dr. Strangelove except that was only fiction.,Jimxor,2025-04-05T17:44:26,1
WSJ has been covering the trump fiasco quite well imho. I use WSJ as my center right source (I try to use multiple news outlets with various biases),Actual-Swing9316,2025-04-06T13:48:29,1
My wife and I have been discussing how tasting menus are too long.,Traditional_Land_553,2025-04-05T22:37:39,0
This clown trounced Kamala.   The empty pantsuit woulda done much less harm.,luvvdmycat,2025-04-05T12:47:32,-8
"I dont believe this to be the case.  “Turning” on Trump is different than “criticizing,” him.  Until you have enough Republican Congressmen and Senators to make a credible impeachment threat, nothing will change.  Republicans right now are looking to give Trump his “beautiful” bill that will cut more services, cut medicare, destroy social security and give more tax cuts to the rich- which will put the nail on the coffin for this massive recession to hit.  No one is “turning” on Trump. They all want this.",Raspberries-Are-Evil,2025-04-05T12:01:24,8
Yep. Their favorite person in the world just fucked with their favorite thing in the world. They'll eventually figure out how to blame this on Biden and nature's balance will be restored.,slipkid,2025-04-05T10:24:16,9
They all voted for Trump at the WSJ.,vicegrip,2025-04-05T14:28:08,2
His minders won’t show him this one; they’ll doctor up with one of the photo edits his followers have on their yard flags where he looks like Rambo. (Those are always on inexplicably tall flag poles too.),OkTransportation1152,2025-04-05T14:24:13,2
In a month or so thousands will likely lose their jobs.  I don’t care if the WSJ saves those jobs or if AOC does.,phxees,2025-04-05T16:09:48,1
"True, put on the appearance that you disagree with him, while in the background cackling about how rich they will get under Trump.  It’s all a show, modeled after pro wrestling soap opera dramas",bakeacake45,2025-04-05T12:06:24,5
They created this situation in the first place. Look behind the hype and see what their owner and board are up to. They are tied to Trump and will ultimately do his bidding,bakeacake45,2025-04-05T16:52:32,1
And Miss USA pageants. Don’t forget who ran that.,Rikers-Mailbox,2025-04-06T12:13:13,2
"Sure, but the country still needs help.  Part of being an adult is having to work with people you despise or made the mess you’re now having to clean up.",phxees,2025-04-05T17:13:20,1
"You missed the point, they will not help clean up the mess.  Again, look at the CEO and board, they are still supporting Trump.  I agree, some Republicans are worth working with. But most are not, and NYT cannot be trusted, they lack integrity.",bakeacake45,2025-04-05T17:17:55,2
"NYT? Or WSJ?  Last I checked, this morning, the NYT isn’t supporting Trump",Rikers-Mailbox,2025-04-06T12:18:26,1
