"don, that stupid piece of shit, was handed a tip-top economy \[by all metrics\] on a SILVER FUCKIN PLATTER. And don immediately seized it, and immediately SHIT all over it. His steaming loose stools are still flopping over the platter sides as I write this; it's nowhere near done. He's such a fuckin MORON. And anyone who supports him is literally unable to discern media information and judge character. Fuck. This fuckin sucks.",Zzz6667,2025-04-04T21:02:00,3

I'm not sure if the maket will ever go backup until 2028. The billionaires have massacred us.,Fragrant-Pickle8119,2025-04-05T14:04:55,2
