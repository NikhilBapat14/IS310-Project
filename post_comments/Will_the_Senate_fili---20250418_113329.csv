"Probably.  Not because Senate Republicans are too principled to remove it, but because nothing Trump really, really wants to do actually requires the filibuster.",GabuEx,2025-04-20T00:37:02,58
"Nothing is impossible, but I would be surprised — and I haven’t been surprised lately. I think the Senate will be more resistant to ceding their power to the Executive than the House was which, to be fair, was basically none. The filibuster is a way they can maintain a balance of power with someone like Trump while also not creating an opening for Democrats in the future. It has an added bonus of providing cover to GOP Senators who may not want their real vote on the record.  But we also live in bizarro world so I could be completely off and tomorrow the Senate blows it up.",brainkandy87,2025-04-20T00:07:50,27
"The filibuster should not exist in the first place.  It needs to go.  So much of the problems in this country stem from the inability of an election to matter because the minority party was able to sabotage the majority from being able to pass the bills and budgets that they campaigned on.  The filibuster won’t save the country from what is happening now but if it never existed might have prevented the rise of the maga movement that is fueled by people who feel government doesn’t work.  The people need to feel the consequences of the republican agenda in all aspects of their life.  Let pain be the teacher.  It might take a decade or more to remove the current regime from power.  The people need to see their retirements evaporate, see their buying power vanish, feel their freedoms and security evaporate as a floundering idiot king fucks every aspect of their lives up daily.",JDogg126,2025-04-20T06:12:49,19
"Yes. It would have already ended up on the agenda if they were going to make a push for it. Political capital is weakened by time, and there has been pretty much no push to remove it from conservative senators.   Besides, Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, Murkowski, and Rand Paul will never vote to remove it. They have shown plenty of ability to vote against Trump on things they know are going to be bad, and they aren't going to make such a stupid decision.",getawarrantfedboi,2025-04-20T02:17:57,9
"I come from the most conservative state in Australia — basically a weird mashup of Florida and Alabama. Federally, we vote conservative at pretty much every election. I see trump stickers on people’s trucks semi regularly.   Despite the massive conservative lean, in the past 43 years we’ve only had about 6 years of conservative state government.   Interestingly, we are also the only state without a state senate.   The theory goes that because there’s no upper house, whenever the right gets in, they can push through their full agenda without any real checks — and they usually go so silly that they end up scaring the electorate off for another decade.",Either-Operation7644,2025-04-20T00:51:37,8
"Republicans will never get rid of the filibuster on legislation because it benefits them way more than it thwarts them.  The ""conservative"" parts of federal government are often the parts deemed essential, which means that even if there is a shutdown, the federal works in question can't stay home or go looking for a new job. They have to work and hope the eventual budget that is passed will include back pay (it always has, including for furloughed workers).  When a filibuster blocks Republican legislation, it means they can't kneecap a (liberal) spending, cut taxes on the rich, or pass some piece of hate legislation. But they still tried, they get to blame the blocking on Democrats and run the same legislation later.  The only reason Democrats haven't torched the filibuster yet is cowardice. Fear of looking like authoritarians by reducing the minority's ability to engage/block. Fear of corporate/big donors cutting them off because dumping the filibuster could signal a willingness to hike taxes on the richest.  I think it is more likely Trump gets impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate than the filibuster getting dumped. And I rate impeachment/conviction odds as near zero.",InFearn0,2025-04-20T13:19:50,2
"Actually, it’s democrats that have been chipping away at the filibuster. Harry Reid did away with filibuster of Judges…",Thats_WY,2025-04-20T12:24:03,4
Currently Trump doesn't seem interested in doing much through Congress. Firing federal workers and replacing them with loyalists while claiming absolute control over spending is enabling Trump to act without Congressional checks.   I think the Trump administration is perfectly happy with the current paradigm. They aren't interested in getting Congress anymore involved and thus the filibuster doesn't matter so much.,8to24,2025-04-20T06:57:40,2
"Sure. Trump is mostly focused on consolidating power within his person, defying the law and the other branches of government. I do not think that passing legislation is very important to him, and Republicans do not have the numbers of pass legislation anyway, so I would expect very little action on the filibuster.",kenlubin,2025-04-21T19:01:55,1
The minute the democrats try is the minute trump tells Republicans to remove it.  And they will.,ThunorBolt,2025-04-21T23:47:11,1
The filibuster is so dumb because at any moment it can be bypassed by a 50% vote. It's like the meme with a kid using his hand to push a boot on his own face. Just make the requirement 50% and stop pretending. ,kittenTakeover,2025-04-22T10:56:11,1
"Nah, the next time it will be under threat is when democrats don’t want it to exist again.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-04-20T04:33:46,-1
"Plenty of what he's doing is unconstitutional without an act of Congress, but the Republicans in Congress seem content to just let him do whatever he wants by EO anyway.",blaqsupaman,2025-04-20T09:57:06,18
"I'm not necessarily in favor of getting rid of the filibuster, but I 100% think we should go back to an actual talking filibuster where they have to work for it and can't just run out the clock on a whim.",blaqsupaman,2025-04-20T09:58:52,11
"That’s a rather misleading stat to cite for Queensland, as it was continuously governed by various right and center-right parties for 32 years from 1957-1989. Since then Labor has been more prominent, due in large part to end of the Bjelkemander that occurred when Labor took power in 1989 and changed the electoral boundaries.     Vote shares have not meaningfully changed, but because of the more fair boundaries it removed the boost given to the more conservative rural seats that allowed the conservative parties to successfully form majority coalitions despite Labor being the largest party in the legislature.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-20T01:45:22,7
The only way they’ll really change their tune is when they start losing in the midterms,WhatAreYouSaying05,2025-04-20T22:39:37,3
The filibuster is just a defect to the rules of order that is a major cause of the collapse of self-determination in this country.  Literally the people can choose to change management and the former management can poison every single effort to improve the country?  Fuck that.  It’s got to go.,JDogg126,2025-04-20T10:14:09,10
"There is absolutely no discrepancy between what you’ve said, and what I said. Both can be true.",Either-Operation7644,2025-04-20T05:17:03,0
There in fact is—the reason that the right has been far less prominent is because the elimination of the Bjelkemander in 1989 allowed the more left leaning urban areas in and around Brisbane to rise in electoral prominence at the expense of the rural areas.     It has absolutely nothing to do with what agenda is being pushed through or people being scared off—to be quite blunt the fact that the right/center right parties have only managed majorities in something like three parliaments after the Bjelkemander was ended speaks for itself.,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-20T22:18:35,1
I agree the end of the Bjelkemander is the defining reason for the return of Labor to electoral contention in Queensland after 1989.   On the other hand the removal of the Bjelkemander does absolutely nothing to explain how a state that has favoured the LNP in all but 1 federal election since 1992 has consistently voted for Labor at a state level over the same period.,Either-Operation7644,2025-04-20T22:53:49,1
