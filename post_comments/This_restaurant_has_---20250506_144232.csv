"Yeah this isn’t surprising at all.   Hike up minimum wage, business owners respond by firing folks and automating jobs or raising prices exponentially. Minimum wage hikes NEVER help anyone long term. Never will.",ITrCool,2025-05-06T16:39:05,22
"A ""living wage"" is an absurd concept. You don't get paid based on your expenses. You get paid based on the value you bring to a business.",cossbobo,2025-05-06T16:37:50,23

Small business owners don’t have the capital to automate at those levels. They will just shut down and disappear over time. ,Blahblahnownow,2025-05-06T16:46:47,7
"My only thought... Who exactly cleans, sanitizes and restocks the food like bits the bot uses to fabricate hamburgers. 🤔  Not to mention maintenance and repair. 🤣",M_i_c_K,2025-05-06T16:45:38,1
"Man people don’t get this at all.  How many and of what quality people would a business paying $2 an hour get? None. As long as there’s more than one place to work competitive wages will be a thing.  Even right now who is paying minimum wage? It’s like $7.75 here. Nobody, even teenagers who don’t have bills is going to work for that",chillthrowaways,2025-05-07T17:35:08,1

"It's a Right to Repair issue. Contractually, they can only use certain techs to fix their machines, and there isn’t enough of those certain techs to go around to every McDonalds at any given moment. If Micky Ds could call just *any* technician when there is an issue, then the ice cream machines could be fixed expeditiously.",sowellpatrol,2025-05-07T02:47:49,3
"Weelllllllll there’s more to that story on the ice cream machines, actually. It was a contract/rights dispute with the machine manufacturer.   So “it’s broken” became the company-wide excuse not to use the machines to prevent them from actually breaking until the dispute was settled.   Sounds like just recently, McD’s got the thing settled, though.",ITrCool,2025-05-06T17:03:29,2
