"You previously said ""he learned his lesson"" (during an impeachment so no need for removal), how the fuck is that working out for you Susan?!?! As a former Mainah (or Maniac if you prefer), fucking do your job, for once...""Mrs. I'm gonna serve two terms and be done"". Eat an entire satchel of Richards, you fucking fossil.

"Susan Collins is one very, very slick, slippery politician. She knows just when to signal that she MIGHT be shifting to bring attention to herself and give hope to the Democrats that maybe there's a crack. She's done that with Supreme Court nominations, legislation, and ""concern"" over a number of issues. But at the very end, she does what she does EVERY single time, she votes with the Republicans. So Mainers now is the time to get her the hell out of there and put in somebody that will actually do something instead of just give you lip service and screw you at the 11th hour. If you live in Maine, give money to whoever is running against her and support him or her.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-26T03:40:21,18
"Does she realize how pathetic she sounds with the constant ""concern"" talk over the decades?     Do the people of Maine realize how pathetic they look?     It's like a comedian who can only tell one joke but people keep on going to see him.",GaimeGuy,2025-04-26T02:45:02,16

"Depends on the federal position. Some Feds can work until they literally keel over assuming that they continue to meet their job requirements. Law enforcement positions are dependent on whether you can pass the physical. ATCs have a mandatory retirement age. So it really varies.  That said, there should really be an age limit for elected officials, judges, etc. We really shouldn‚Äôt have octogenarians and older making decisions when they won‚Äôt even be around to see the consequences. Plus the whole cognitive decline that often happens around those ages.",Accidental-Hyzer,2025-04-26T10:11:13,2
