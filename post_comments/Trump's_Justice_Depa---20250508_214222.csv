"“The investigation began after William Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, alleging that James “has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire government backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.”  Pulte claimed James received deals on mortgage terms by falsifying information related to multiple properties, over the course of decades. The allegations include listing a home in Norfolk, Virginia as her “principal residence” despite living and working in New York, buying a five-family property in Brooklyn with a loan that is only available for homes with four units or less, and an accusation that, in 1983, James’ father signed mortgage documents stating they were husband and wife.”      Literally what Trump was accused of",fuck-nazi,2025-05-09T04:33:04,3

Because, if you’re not, then you must surely understand why such a flippant comment is utterly disconnected from reality.

"250k in 1963 were earning recognition for their rights. Not overthrowing the government by forcing Congress to impeach and convict. They are very different things.

You’re grandstanding here to feel good, and that’s fine. But saying “you are the government” is very different from acknowledging what that means and what is required to make that reality. This isn’t a movie.  To “take our country back” would, again, require a massive mobilization of people to force Congress to do their duty. A tall task that won’t happen over night.

"You are grandstanding, because you suggested we magically impeach and remove him from office, and now refuse to acknowledge the reality of the situation.   Many of us are collectively screaming “enough,” but the pain hasn’t even been felt yet. Not nearly enough of us are motivated and mobilized. And no, we actually have a terrible track record of dealing with dictators.  So, again, the only legal means of removing Trump from office now are impeachment and conviction or otherwise an execution of the 25th amendment. And again, to be absolutely clear, neither of those things are things we control directly. We would therefore need to apply pressure, to the tune of 11 million people if that 3% model is correct, to arrive and physically pressure those in capital to act.

"Clinton, a Democrat, was impeached by a Republican controlled House. He was not convicted in the Senate though, so I don't see how the claim that they brought down Clinton is correct. There is no way the current Republican controlled House would impeach Trump. The Republican party has honed its technique of going after their own in primaries if they do not demonstrate fealty. There are not tons of Republican Congressmen that could be pressured into impeaching Trump as you claim. That's a nice fantasy, but that's all it is. For most of them an impeachment vote against Trump would be the end of their political career as the billionaires pumped money into the primaries next year (Congressional elections are in 2026 not 2027) to replace them, and they are not going to risk that.   I write, email or call my Congressman's office before major votes and not once.....not ONCE....has it mattered. He votes MAGA party line every single time, no matter how damaging the proposed bill is to the country or his district.

"Canada and Australia are not built upon the same myth of “individual ruggedness” aka “I don’t need anyone, I’ll sink or swim on my own” as the US. Unregulated Capitalism and Western Masculinity have poisoned the well of Social responsibility in the US. THAT is why it’ll have to get THAT bad before the US reacts as Canada or Australia did. “I’m still good, so who cares if everything else has gone to shit?” aka “Fuck you, got mine.” The US is a very, very sick country and has been since its inception. But because the US either refuses too, or is blocked from addressing these systemic issues (usually because of $$$) they have ended up in this scenario, and reality hitting citizen’s smack dab in the face with consequences will likely be the only thing that causes movement sadly - if even then.
