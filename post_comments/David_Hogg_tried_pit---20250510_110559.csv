He may not like giving up the benefits of being a vice chair but getting kicked out of the DNC for trying to stiffen the Democratic spine in the fight against fascism is likely good for David Hogg politically.,yo2sense,2025-05-10T11:35:03,1
"Critical support to Hogg. No idea what his leadership/management skills are, but I know how useless the do nothing incumbents are.   Down with the enablers and let a new generation rise.",_nc_sketchy,2025-05-10T11:48:31,1
"How irregular is it for a DNC leadership person to be heavily involved in primaries? If it’s a thing that definitely shouldn’t happen and is irregular, then Martin isn’t wrong to rebuff Hogg. If it’s kind of standard and other people have done it, then the DNC might be picking on Hogg and unfairly hamstringing him. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-10T12:35:32,1

"Watched Hogg on Bill Maher last night.  He's doesn't seem that different from the DNC establishment.  He kept saying Medicare and Medicaid should be the top priority... a message which has barely, sometimes worked over the last 30 years.  Even Hogg doesn't get it: the top priority should be reining in wealth inequality.  Either he's become part of the establishment, or he's being played by the establishment.",Caraes_Naur,2025-05-10T11:47:07,1
"> Speaking with DNC Chair Ken Martin, Hogg proposed a so-called “internal firewall” in which he would stay on as vice chair but be barred from accessing any internal DNC information about congressional and state legislative races as long as he was supporting challengers, according to three people familiar with their conversations and granted anonymity to describe them.  ""Look, I agree that what I'm doing precludes me from doing the vice chair job, but what I propose is that I stop doing the vice chair job but also keep the vice chair job. You know, compromise!""",kneeco28,2025-05-10T11:16:30,1

"We are quickly approaching a point at which the DNC and the Democrat establishment will wish they had let us save them from themselves.  At this point, I am content to consider them fascist collaborators and bring them up on charges if we get an second Nuremberg.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-10T17:05:45,1

"I am fine with everyone being primaried - it keeps them paying attention.   So far as donating to his PAC i would do some research into it and decide. Here is the Opensecrets write up about it.  https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/C00843110/summary/2024  In the last election cycle, the PAC raised about 12M. It contributed 12K to federal candidates ... which isn't much.  At this point I don't fully understand what they are doing with the money.",SurroundTiny,2025-05-10T13:20:02,1

What is this milquetoast attitude?  We're in the middle of rapidly escalating fascism brought on in large part by the weakness (being charitable) of the democrats. The answer to this is not decorum and civility. Ffs we need fighters.  Norms are dead and gone. We need people to step up and overthrow the DNC into an organization that works for us.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-10T17:15:00,1
They should not be involved in the primaries other to support them from a logistical standpoint. If they want a rule passed to prevent that more power to them.  Hogg should resign and use the PAC resources as desired.,SurroundTiny,2025-05-10T13:11:54,1
">Even Hogg doesn't get it: the top priority should be reining in wealth inequality.  I agree, focusing on wealth inequality is a flawed approach from a policy perspective but it's a major win from a populist one.",thrawtes,2025-05-10T12:48:16,1
"He won’t make it a top priority, because his donors wouldn’t like that, and there goes the gravy train.",HuskerDont241,2025-05-10T12:35:09,1
Probably both. His only radicalism is on guns and his anger that the dems haven't done enough. I'm not sure he's the guy to face down fascism. We need someone way more forward and belligerent for that.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-10T17:28:22,1

"DNC leadership endorsing specific primary challengers sounds like it could be breaking the sort of neutrality they’re supposed to have. Maybe Hogg should have decided to either run for the leadership spot or to do activism supporting primaries, but not both. There’s also the fact that I haven’t seen anything that makes me feel like he or whoever he ends up supporting will do anything different from current Dems. There’s simply not much they can do and generic talk of “being a fighter” doesn’t magically conjure up solutions. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-10T17:35:37,1
