"I don't think so.  Article II of the Constitution states:  > Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress[.]  While there is debate over the extent of the ""Legislature,"" the text seems to make clear that it is up to each state to decide how to allocate electors and that the federal government has no power whatsoever to change that.  (Which sort of answers your bonus question too, as long as the state specifies a method of appointment, it is by definition constitutional because the Constitution itself says a state can do whatever it wants, more or less [setting aside hypotheticals that would infringe on poll taxes and stuff]).",digbyforever,2022-10-25T21:53:59,3
"It hasn't been tested in court, so the answer isn't really definitive, but pretty much everyone seems to think the answer is no. The Constitution seems to state explicitly that this is a state level power. The Court has gotten even more protective of that stuff over the last few years as it has chipped away at the federal Voting Rights Act in favor of state power, so I don't think any reasonable person could suggest that such a law passed by Congress would ever be enforced.",mormagils,2022-10-26T09:42:43,2
"No.  The US is , really, is more like the European Union than people think.  Congress ""Certifying"" the Presidential election is,  really, just acknowledging that it received instruction from the states as to who they elected President.  Congress has little role, other than to count the votes, and announce the results.   Their approval of the electors, or the process by which they are chosen, is irrelevant.  The *only* exception is when *competing* panels of electors are presented.   The process for dealing with these is described in the constitution.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-10-27T18:08:43,2
