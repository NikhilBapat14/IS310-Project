"I’m skeptical the Catholic Church could ever be a good guy in a situation but if this guy is already pissing MAGA off, it’s a good sign.",YNotZoidberg2020,2025-05-08T16:47:32,18
"Thinking Vance and Trump are wrong is a good first step but imo a pretty low bar.  A pope who actively calls out and condems alleged christians who vilify immigrants, glorify wealth and suck up to Trump would be pretty refreshing.    Also looking forward to deep dish eucharist.",sminthianapollo,2025-05-08T16:38:35,30

"I suppose it's good then, that neither Trump nor Vance were in the Sistine chapel as cardinals, voting on who would be the new pope?  What kind of stupid headline is this?",Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T16:49:24,-3
Oh no let’s get upset about a US citizen being critical of one of an elected officials. Coming from the party that pretends to champion free speech . Let’s just hope that JD doesn’t kill this pope aswell 😉.,NotaRussianbott89,2025-05-09T05:40:35,0
