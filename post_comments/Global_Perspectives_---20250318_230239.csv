"I realize that you are probably Serbian and I will tell you what is happening now in Greece because although there is media coverage for the protests here and there we both know for a fact that this does not necessarily mean that they depict the whole truth. To give a backstory for anyone else reading this in February of 2023 there was a head-on collision between a passenger train and a freight train in the Tempe valley, 57 people died, most of them were young people, students. There are allegations of the freight train carrying illegal and unknown types of fuel that created a fire which consequently killed people that could have been saved. And why they are unknown you ask? Because a few days after the crash the authorities covered up this crime scene with cement and so the real findings cannot be uncovered. The aftermath two years after is still ongoing. At first they blamed it on the station master, although there were no security protocols, measures and systems. The trains had no gps systems and the handlers were communicating via vhf and telephone to know where they are going.   The transport minister resigned, only to be re-elected a few months after and get another ministry. Justice has not yet come for the victims’ families and although the prime minister allegedly passed a bill that “can prosecute ministers and present and past members of parliament” it seems that it has not been done yet and any liability for them for the fatality is gone after June of this year so there has been a pushback in convictions.   I strongly believe that any even slight progress in the case of “how”, “why” has happened because of the countless protests that I want to remark have no political background because people of all ideologies think that this deserves justice. There are honestly so many things to say about this fatality but I wanted to keep it short to discuss your questions. Although your prime minister resigned while ours didn’t.   First of all this is a deep rooted issue that goes back decates. There has always been corruption that dare I say accumulates and leads to these fatalities.   1.and 2. Keep protesting peacefully. Although here two years after protests for Tempe that are peaceful are being met with chemicals from the police it keeps reminding to every citizen that this is still in our minds and it will not be forgotten, and we won’t forget that we want justice. Don’t wait for any lasting impact because systemic problems do not change unfortunately. No politician is selfless enough to do the things needed. But all of this aside If you do not let it be forgotten it won’t.  3. Honestly the international community won’t help you very much. For us there was and still is international media coverage, we have gone to the European justice court but this is something that can happen from within no other country will care as much as you do for your own people.  4.It does not affect you. Let them say gibberish stuff but it won’t touch you because the people going to the protests know in what they believe and in a matter like this it doesn’t matter what you believe. They can say that it is a leftist or a right or an opponent’s protest but when thousands and millions of people are there they know the truth and politicians can say anything they want.  5. This is a tricky one because they will try to be manipulated by other political forces. Members of opposition parties can start going to the protests and then it can be said that this is proof this is political. And again the opposition will try to get voters by saying “we will find” “we will punish” which are all lies. For us every party says now that the current government is responsible and to be punished to be put out of power, although each one of these parties that has been to power has “helped” to get to here now, with all the systemic corruption .  And finally as of writing this I saw after I wrote everything that the whole current government resigned because of your protests which is a huge progress in what you want to achieve. So in the end my view is that for any other government that will come to power, push for justice and as much as you can push for change. I think everywhere there should be independent oversight (which I think exists but it is not really “independent”).   I hope all goes well, and you get the justice you deserve.",Mysterious-Fox-7536,2025-03-19T09:35:17,2
