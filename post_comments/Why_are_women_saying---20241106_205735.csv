"They're likely referring to abortion, and they don't mean *literally* today, but that the election was a turning point or lost opportunity. Obviously anyone who says that he is ""in office"" right now, today, is mistaken, but he will be in office in just a bit over 2 months, so pretty soon.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, they aren't referring to a particular law or policy, but that voters, knowing what was at stake, chose the candidate who would not protect abortion access over one who would.  The most likely changes regarding abortion policy under a Trump administration are going to be court-related. The Biden administration has been willing to sue states that it felt made abortion restrictions that were too restrictive (and Idaho's was partially overturned by SCOTUS because it conflicted with federal law). The Trump administration is unlikely to continue to challenge states' abortion restrictions in court.  Additionally, Trump will be able to appoint more federal judges, making it more likely for the courts to uphold strict abortion laws. One of Trump's previous appointees went so far as to issue a ruling that rescinded FDA approval for one of the main abortion medications, but he was overturned on appeal. A second Trump administration allows more like-minded judges to be appointed and possibly at to higher levels.  Additionally additionally, some localities are trying to enact laws that would punish people for even *traveling through* to obtain an abortion. A Trump administration might or might not challenge such laws, but a Harris administration certainly would have.",curien,2024-11-07T15:06:14,6
"Because there is now no chance of recovering abortion as a right, which it was for 49 years, until Trump and the Federalist Society obtained enough Justices on the Supreme Court to overturn the decision--based on no rational legal argument whatsoever.   At this time, whether a woman has bodily autonomy after becoming pregnant depends entirely on where she lives and/or whether she has the resources to get somewhere else. In states with Trump abortion bans--whether Florida's now-permanent 6-week ban, or those states where the ban starts at a time when women CAN actually know they are pregnant--women lose bodily autonomy the moment they become pregnant. At that point, the state can regulate, control, and punish what she eats and drinks, where she goes, how she behaves, etc. There are women in jail today for ""endangering an unborn child"" for the decisions made before or after learning they were pregnant.   The MAGA legislators have no intention of ""leaving it to the states,"" BTW, no matter what Trump says. There is a national ban coming--and even if there is no national ban, if you live in a state with a ban, it might as well be national. Moreover, even if a woman has no intention of ever having an abortion, in states like Texas now, the laws are such that if she comes to a point where she needs one to save her life and fertility, her doctor risks a 99-year prison sentence for performing a life-saving abortion that is later deemed by some law-enforcement agent as not having been necessary.   And, to be clear, there is no situation in this country where a man who has not been at least accused of a crime can be stripped of his bodily autonomy. Nor do the partners of pregnant women have their rights revoked in any way whatsoever.   That's why. Women no longer have a voice in what happens to them once they become pregnant, depending on what state they live in.",DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-09T16:09:22,5
"Were not acting scared, we are scared.  It isn't happening today but as soon as he is in office they are likely to try to pass a federal abortion and contraception ban.  And right here, this is the part I think a lot of guys don't fully comprehend :  contraception, including abortion is the only thing that raises women above the status of slaves in all human societies. If we are not in control of our bodies and reproduction and the choice of whether or not to give birth to a child, then we are livestock.  Men are larger and stronger have more opportunities and freedom than us, and contraception is the biggest, strongest thing we have ever had in all of history to somewhat level the playing field.

"When Trump was president, he elected multiple conservatives to the Supreme Court. These Supreme Court justices said they would not get rid of Roe vs. Wade and then they did it anyway. Once that was done, Republican controlled states were able to enact strict abortion bans. For example, Texas bans abortions after 6 weeks. (Weeks of pregnancy start on the day of your last menstrual period, so at ""6 weeks"" it has only been 2 weeks since you missed your period. This gives you very little time to decide what to do next.)  Texas is supposed to allow exceptions for abortion if the mother's life is threatened, but it also says doctors will get life in prison for ""murder"" if they perform an abortion outside of these circumstances. No one has clearly defined what a life threatening condition during pregnancy really is, and doctors don't want to get life in prison, so they are waiting too long to perform life saving abortions. Now multiple women in Texas have died and lost fertility from care being delayed (even women who had wanted, planned pregnancies). The maternal mortality rate in Texas is up over 50% since these laws were enacted in 2021. In states without these laws, the maternal mortality rate is up 11%.   I live in Texas and my husband and I are talking about moving because we want to have a baby in a few years. I would be scared of dying from a preventable death if I were pregnant in this state. It's sad because we have built our lives here and I really don't want to move, but it does make me nervous.  The United Nations considers abortion to be a human right. I hope you understand the importance of voting and do so in the future. You are already trying to educate yourself, so that is a good start.",acl2244,2024-11-10T10:07:53,1

That they could so despise trans people that they would reverse all the civil rights progress since the 1960s for blacks and women and gays.

"Assuming that Dr.s and medical associations are less educated then the minority of politicians pushing for bans makes me wonder if you also do not have a background in medicine. I would strongly suggest watching the documentary about the recent court case in TX  I linked above to better understand the situation.  The law is not specific like medicine. When someome is having complications, in normal a situation the doctor would not wait until the pregnant person is dying to act because the patient may die and/or suffer irreparable damage. The law does not state when the patient will be sick enough or close enough to death for the doctor to save them. Is it 20% chance or 90% chance of death? Someone can go from somewhat sick to dying  of sepsis quickly or it can take days. And when a doctor has to  sign a petition to get a judges approval -to save a patients life- the patient could die or be unable to carry in the future becuase the doctor was not able to act quickly like they are trained to do. Doctors do not want to be jailed and lose their license so they are following protocol or they are leaving the state causing more women to live without access to healthcare.

"No, the only thing Harris talked about as women’s rights was abortion. After that it was all transgender as if that was women’s rights when in reality it strips away women’s rights. And even about abortion, Harris lied about it. In fact, the worst liars about abortion are the pro choice abortionists. There is no total abortion ban because every state in the union allows for an abortion if the mother’s life is in danger, and heartbeat laws don’t take effect until a fatal heartbeat is detected which is about 6 weeks in. Until a heartbeat is detected, a woman can still legally get an abortion. In fact, the largest of portion of women who get an abortion is the 45% that gets one within the first six weeks. And I do want to post that graph here that shows it. It is half way down this page: https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/key-facts-on-abortion-in-the-united-states/ the reason why they want to shut down the clinics because they are not up to the same hospital sanitary standards as hospitals are for a surgery.  But do you know what they call laws that prevent the shutting down of clinics because of sanitary standards are misleadingly called? After the Dobbs decision sending abortion back to the states, those laws were called by the misleading name of “abortion protection laws”. I’m not kidding, go look it up.

"Oh there is more to it than that. First off, every fetal heartbeat law has almost 6 week grace period to get an abortion before the heartbeat laws generally go into effect when a fetal heartbeat is detected. Now the pro choice abortionists claim that most women don’t know they are pregnant within the first 6 weeks. It may be technically true stats-wise, it is not true logical and facts wise because largest percentage of women who get an abortion is women who do know they are pregnant and got an abortion with in the first six weeks - 45% - nearly half of the women who get one. So the abortionists are lying on that. Also add to it that the average minstrel cycle is 28 days with some as long 23 to 35 days. Well within the time frame of 6 weeks for women to realize they missed a period and realize they are pregnant. Also throw in the facts that while most OBGYN doctors might do an abortion IF THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER IS IN DANGER, less than 14% would agree do an elective abortion. Out of the fewer of 14% of OBGYNs that do an abortion, unfortunately, it is that group is where doctors who provide abortion as the centerpiece of their practices comes from. Their practices are businesses- Aka money. Do you think they just may have an ulterior motive for protesting heartbeat laws? And in Texas, if an abortion is done after 6 weeks, the doctor and the hospital is required to submit to a panel of doctors to determine if the abortion was legal and if the mother’s life was endangered or if there is something wrong with the abortion.

Indeed, some of the most common issues in a healthy pregnancy include bladder damage, hemorrhage (bleeding uncontrollably), and pelvic tearing.

"No, words actually mean things. ""Triggered"" is a word used by professionals to describe a psychological reaction to verbal, visual, or aural stimuli that induces or re-induces trauma. A person who has been raped and later happens to see a media representation of rape may be triggered by it, experience flashbacks and be unable to perceive themselves and their surroundings appropriately for a period of time, whether brief or extended.   It has nothing to do with the way MAGA uses it to mean ""insulted"" or ""offended."" Even though right-wing nitwits took the word from ""trigger warning,"" (which is a term for educating in sensitive subjects with compassion for the listeners'  potential trauma), they did so with no understanding of its actual meaning. This is unfortunate because trigger warnings were developed because of the increase in students entering academia with traumatic histories such as veterans returning with PTSD to get an education.   While MAGA people who derisively refer to ""trigger warnings"" claim they are used because kids coming into college are ""snowflakes"" who are being protected from the real world, they actually are used to prevent retraumatizing victims of violence and veterans with PTSD because they have ALREADY experienced trauma IN THE REAL WORLD.   Those who ridicule trauma, trigger warnings, and those who are triggered (which, again, means actually experiencing a psychological fugue induced by retraumatization) should be ashamed of themselves. Especially those who are making money on making fun of the need for such measures. It is ignorant and vile to use these concepts in this way.   Shame on them.",DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-15T03:34:08,1

Condoms are a good option when paired with women learning and knowing their cycle. 47 years old with three children in college? I’m wondering why that couple didn’t implement a more permanent form of birth control. Maybe a vasectomy involves money and discomfort but definitely less money and discomfort than an unwanted pregnancy. If it’s a priority, it can be prioritized.   Unpopular opinion: I think abortions are being relied on too heavily as a form of birth control and if people prevented pregnancy like their life depended on it, we wouldn’t be in this mess. ",Traditional_Win1875,2024-11-26T00:10:06,1

"Circumcision is mutilation of male genitalia, and despite it not being medically necessary in most cases, it is typically done to literal newborns who can't even medically consent to it. But that's alright because it's usually done solely for religious reasons, yeah?   The husband stitch is still very much a thing and is still done to women without their knowledge nor medical consent to this day. But that's not worth making a national fuss over, is it?    Breasts implants are also mutilation of a secondary sex characteristic, but that's fine, too, right? After all, this surgery is the one where the person being mutilated knowingly consented to having it done, out of the three that I've listed so far.   Intersex surgeries, while rare, also exist and are done to both infants and adults alike to conform their bodies to one sex. (In case you aren't aware, intersex people are born with both female and male reproductive systems, one may be atrophied or sterile while the other is functional, some may be born with both atrophied/sterile, etc. Point is they are born with both male and female reproductive systems.) For infants/children that don't understand what gender or sexuality is yet, this can be, and usually is, done without their consent because a parent/guardian may consent for them in their place. Sometimes they decide to remove the incorrect genitalia, and it negatively impacts the intersex person for their entire lifetime because they may have psychologically developed as the opposite sex of the genitalia that was removed. But that's okay, because they now only have one physical sex, right?   Both men and women can elect to sterilize themselves so they can't have children, or at least they significantly lower the chances of doing so. Is this also not voluntary mutilation of genitalia/reproductive organs?   Are you okay with things like piercings or tattoos on breasts/penises? If not, do you allow consenting adults the legal right to get their breasts/penises pierced or tattooed despite not agreeing with it?  Contrast to the surgeries/medical procedures I listed above, transgender-related gender reassignment surgeries aren't typically done to minors, and aren't typically approved by a doctor on a patient's fleeting whim nor without the patient's consent...

Or indoctrinating children socially to believe you can actually change the sex you were born as without first considering that there are worst issues at play.   Breast implants are consensual in all cases hopefully. And they are enhancements. Which do not require skipping puberty, interference with natural and necessary development of the physical body, are reversible and do not take away a woman’s ability to breast feed permanently if she becomes pregnant and it is not done to innocent children who cannot consent.

Adults can do whatever the hell they want and can mutilate themselves as much as they’d like.

"Good for you. That doesn’t change my opinion that minors shouldn’t be receiving puberty blockers. That should be an adult decision. Age of consent matters. If your home state says you can consent at a certain age, perhaps 16, I don’t have a problem with it.  Trans is a choice, but children at elementary school ages cannot make those informed decisions.   Right now, WA state is pushing for a bill that would make it legal to keep secrets from parents about these issues. It’s reprehensible.   There are multiple cases of men and boys being allowed into women’s restrooms and that has led to the safety and privacy of women being violated.  In VA, a $30 million lawsuit was launched by a family of a 15 year old girl who was raped by a boy wearing a skirt. This is due to laws pressuring schools to allow people who identify as the opposite gender to use their preferred gender identity. Which forces administration to allow boys to use girls bathrooms.  Your personal experience doesn’t account for these issues. Clearly you have enough respect for girls and women as you consider others in your own personal decisions.   I’m not making being trans perverse at all. These are real issues women are facing. Invasion of privacy, biological males being allowed to compete in men’s sports, and trans men claiming they are women when we know that’s not biologically possible.   I don’t think less of trans people because of these situations. I have many trans friends. But even they are aware of the implications of people who take advantage of the rights that trans people have been fighting for, and it leaves a bad taste in everyone’s mouths.   Back when I was in HS, about 12 years ago, I joined GSA. It used to stand for Gay Straight Alliance. They then added the TQI to the LGB as to be more inclusive. That was fine. But now they have changed GSA to stand for Gender Sexuality alliance.  Tell me, why is it okay for these ideologies to be taught to young children? School should be for educational purpose, not introducing young children to ideologies they can’t even comprehend. It fosters confusion and is counterproductive to a child’s natural growth and development.   My trans friends did not claim to want to be highlighted and celebrated in everything, they did not push for being recognized as women. They were fine being trans people. Just as I was fine being pansexual. But would you ever catch them doing these things that are harmful to other people? No. They just wanted social acceptance. And they didn’t scream at people when they got misgendered. They didn’t and still don’t go to many pride parades that claim to be child friendly when there are people exposing themselves. They did not call to violence when they felt their rights were being stripped away, because trans people and they exist. But this narrative that they are being erased is ludicrous.   It’s good to stay informed and to educate yourself on real world situations.  The trans community is not like how it used to be but I hope people will fight for what’s right. Wrong is wrong. One sexual assault case is enough. One case of saying a 5 year old boy is trans IS ENOUGH. One case of biological males competing and taking advantage of women IS ENOUGH. One case of indecent exposure to minors IS ENOUGH.",veinypale,2025-02-28T09:15:10,1

"You have some strong feelings about these issues, and I respect your perspective. At the same time, it's important to address a few points that might offer a different viewpoint on the topics you've raised.  1. **Puberty Blockers and Minors**: The use of puberty blockers is not a decision taken lightly, especially when it comes to minors. In many cases, puberty blockers are used to give young people time to explore their gender identity without undergoing irreversible physical changes. They are typically prescribed after careful evaluation by medical professionals, and the process involves informed consent from both the minor and their guardians. It's important to note that puberty blockers are *reversible* if the decision is made to stop them, which gives young people more time to make informed decisions about their future. It's a complex medical decision that involves a lot of support and oversight, and it’s not just about allowing children to make decisions on their own but ensuring they have the proper support system in place. (I haven't had puberty blockers, as I am flat and I have equal amounts of estrogen and testosterone. I plan to take T in the future in case, otherwise I'm all alright.) 2. **Transgender People and Safety Concerns**: The issues surrounding trans people like me, and safety in bathrooms are sensitive and can be misunderstood. It’s important to distinguish between isolated incidents and the larger picture. The vast majority of transgender people simply want to live their lives without causing harm or discomfort to others. Laws regarding bathroom access are designed to respect people’s gender identity while also ensuring safety for everyone. There’s no evidence to suggest that allowing trans people to use bathrooms aligned with their gender identity increases the risk of assault. In fact, laws that restrict bathroom access may lead to increased harm for trans people, including harassment and violence. 3. **Gender Identity and Sports**: Trans athletes competing in sports is another complex issue. Trans women (assigned male at birth but who identify as female) in women’s sports are a topic of ongoing debate. However, many sports organizations have policies in place to ensure fair competition, such as hormone level regulations. The idea is not to erase women’s achievements but to provide a fair and inclusive space for all athletes, regardless of their gender identity. It’s crucial to recognize that the vast majority of trans people do not ""take advantage"" of such spaces, and most just want to compete based on their identity and abilities. (Same as trans men in sports) 4. **Gender and Education**: Regarding what is being taught in schools, it’s important to remember that gender and sexuality education isn't about indoctrination, but about fostering understanding and respect. Many schools now teach about LGBTQ+ identities to create a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all students. The goal is to reduce bullying, provide support to students who may be struggling with their own identity, and create a more accepting community. Schools need to provide students with the tools to navigate this world, and for many young people, learning about different gender identities helps them feel seen and understood. (Especially trans youth like me, I identify as male and would like to be seen as one. Every trans person's identity is different, and how they choose to express it.) 5. **Trans Rights and Society’s Responsibility**: I understand your concern about the rights of trans individuals potentially being misused, but it’s also important to keep in mind that advocating for trans rights does not mean disregarding the rights of others. Every person, regardless of gender identity, deserves to be treated with respect, dignity, and fairness. The majority of trans people want to live in peace, and they do not seek to impose on others. As with any social movement, there are always fringe elements, but it’s important not to judge an entire group based on the actions of a few individuals.",reddituserthing2,2025-03-01T10:45:28,1
"I wasn't going to come back but I got a notification. You sure like ignoring links and dismissing facts for someone who claims to only believe in facts! So, I won't use facts; I'll use your own arguments.   Yes, one case of pedophilia and/or abuse is enough to put a stop to it. Yet, you don't see nearly as much public backlash against other demographics for individuals committing the same exact crimes.    Is one priest molesting a minor enough to restrict a minor's access to any and all religious practices? Is one teacher performing statutory rape on a minor enough to restrict minors from attending any and all schools? Is one coach exposing themselves to a minor in a locker room enough to restrict a minor's access to any and all sports/gyms/locker rooms? Is one doctor/nurse raping a minor enough to restrict a minor's access to any and all medical facilities/personnel? Is one babysitter abusing a minor enough to restrict a minor's access to any and all forms of non-parental childcare? I also have to wonder if you know that underage marriage is still very much legal in the US in more than half of the states, and the majority of those completely legal marriages are young girls being married off to much older men... or is there not enough public outcry against that for you to have noticed it?  If you're going to use fringe statistics as the basis for your generalizing logic, at least keep it consistent. Wrong is wrong... yet it seems only certain demographics are wrong enough to cause national outrage.",RushOutrageous1023,2025-03-04T22:16:59,1
"  That's another thing at the root.  A fetus is not a baby, not a person. It's not even an independent organism.  Viability outside the womb is still at 25+ weeks and I don't know of any place where abortion that late is done outside of extreme circumstances.  Where do you get the idea that abortion is a ""violent murder""? If you say religion then we're both wasting keystrokes here.  And you are still judging people from your own pov.  How many people don't get a comprehensive education in sex?  How many religiously controlled or influenced school only allow abstinence-only sex Ed?",Round_Skill8057,2024-11-26T14:54:46,1

"I mean, I’ve watched abortion videos on YouTube. They’re hard to stomach. Also, planned parenthood will do late term abortions without extreme circumstances.   If abortion was “gentle murder” would that make it okay? How does viability outside of the womb make a difference here? Yes, a baby under 24 weeks will struggle to survive outside of amniotic fluid just like a fish will struggle to survive out of water and the two of us would struggle to survive without air. Independence does not determine if someone is human. People with disabilities that will never been independent. Or people (young and old) that need to be put on oxygen. A newborn baby isn’t independent. They still need care or else they will die.   It’s such a strange argument that this miniature human with arms and legs and a beating heart is considered “not a person.” Like what is it then if it’s not the beginning stages of a person’s life? I used to be at that stage and you used to be at that stage and we are both people.   Have you ever been pregnant and/or birthed a child? Honest question… it’s not to shame you or anything.   To your last paragraph… 100%.  Sex education and pregnancy prevention needs to be much, much better. I think that’s the path we need to be pursuing though… not deciding that abortion is an okay way to handle unwanted pregnancies.   Also, here’s an abortion video from a doctor. It just happened to be the first one I came across just now but I’m sure you could find different videos if you’d rather see it from another source.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jgw4X7Dw_3k",Traditional_Win1875,2024-11-26T15:27:19,1
"No, it's how I usually list things, especially in my blogs. For example, I spoke about the color spectrum on Miku's hair color, breaking down certain points that are important to represent her hair color!  Like my 2NE1 hyperfixation essay, I broke down my rating, experience, feelings, the members, and much more.

"Have you watched birth videos?  C-section, epesiotomy?  There lots of things with arms and legs and a beating heart that are not people.  In the womb, it's not a person - or it may be more accurate to say that it doesn't matter if it's a person or not.  (I tend to think not. I don't think that something with no thoughts no memories no emotions can be a person) One of the defining features of personhood is bodily autonomy.  It means no one gets to do anything to my body or use my body without my consent.  If a parasite latches onto you, even if it was sentient had a face and could sing like Sinatra, you would be within your rights to remove it if you wanted, even if it died in the process, because the body is yours. If someone knocked on your door and said ""you're a match for my kid who needs a kidney so you're donating one right now"" that would not be OK to most folks because others are not allowed to use our organs without permission.  That should apply equally to my uterus as it does to your kidneys.  Whether a fetus is a person or not, if a woman doesn't want it to be there, it doesn't have an automatic right to be there.  If it's a person, it's personhood does not supercede the woman's just because it's a cute miniature. Going this far into the grit of the concept of personhood that we have to start applying property rights to our organs wouldn't even be necessary however if one stops to consider how horrifying and traumatic it must be for women, and let's face it, girls, who are being put in this position where they don't want to give birth, but they are not given a choice because other people who don't know anything about them have decided that the rights of a blob of cells that has no memories, no thoughts, no emotions, no name, isn't wanted or needed, is more important than anything that *she* is, anything she has, and she has all of those qualities that make someone a person.  I think when you force someone to give birth who doesn't want to you are taking her personhood away from her to give it to the baby.  I think that is dead wrong.",Round_Skill8057,2024-11-26T19:46:04,1
