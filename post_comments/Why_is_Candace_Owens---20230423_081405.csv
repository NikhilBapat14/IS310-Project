Because she’s a troll that gets paid to troll. Best to ignore her pointless outbursts. Similar to how you would treat a toddler having a tantrum. The last thing you do is try to use reason or logic.,[deleted],2023-04-24T09:50:45,107
It’s not too complicated.  She says awful things far right conservatives want to hear because it makes her money.  That’s it.,freedraw,2023-04-24T20:23:39,46
"She thinks that if women were no longer allowed to vote, Democrats would never win an election again, and that’s a trade she’s willing to make. Ann Coulter has been saying the same thing for years",duke_awapuhi,2023-04-24T05:50:55,60

"Is she saying women’s suffrage was bad, or is she saying that’s the last great thing to happen in U.S. society? Either way, she’s wrong.  Plus, I’m sure she appreciates the Loving v. Virginia case, even if she doesn’t realize it.  Honestly, she’s an intellectual lightweight, like most conservative pundits these days. George Will is probably the last intellectual conservative.",HorrorMetalDnD,2023-04-24T08:33:21,41

Worse a BLACK woman railing against the right to vote. Two groups who fought hard to get voting rights.,tuna_tofu,2023-04-24T18:05:49,15
"I suspect she is trolling. However it does seem that each time the leading figures on the right joke about things it inevitably pulls the GOP farther to the extremes. Right now it’s as likely as not to be a ploy to distract viewers and voters from the fact that conservative lawyers, state governments and judges are trying to take away abortion in every form in the whole country but they have also taken steps to reduce access to birth control.  However in the future who knows maybe her joke really will turn out to only be faking funny and we will end up in a real life handmaidens tale.",Decent_Historian6169,2023-04-24T20:07:20,4

The main argument against women's voting in the 1910's was if the got the right to vote the would also have the responsibilities that come with like being drafted into the army or fire brigade. In modern day more and more people are talking about expanding the draft to women. Her argument is probably something like I'll give up my right to vote if that means I will never be drafted.,zachfriedel,2023-04-24T14:56:46,4

My guess is that she asked the question to see how many people would make the unfounded assumption that she is denouncing female suffrage versus how many people would name some of the numerous positive things. There is no denunciation in the question.,NoTable2313,2023-04-24T06:53:39,-4

"What if it were the other way around? Women had all the rights and men none.  How would you feel?   That’s what makes society better.  When everyone is a contributing member of society we can expand our knowledge and technological advancements.  You cut 50% of the brains out of the pool you end up with a shallow pool.   Society is better when we treat people like people, not commodities or property.   It’s not one thing, it’s everything.",Forgetful_Suzy,2023-04-24T19:46:44,5

think critically please. There are an infinite amount of ways we are a better country now than back then. We are a richer country now than we were when women were fighting for suffrage. We have a lot more technology. Like what do you want?,Grayer95,2023-04-24T14:09:05,17

"Nobody is doubting that women should have the right to vote. Nobody.  Of course women should vote.  The question at hand is quite simple - how is our society better off now that women can vote?

"I know you're just being obnoxious for fun, but how about increased quality of life for women, children, minorities, working class people? A greater focus on public education? Public health research? Women in the arts? Increasing participation by women in the global economy means greater wealth in circulation.

Okay ima say this real slow  for you. The question asked was this:  “Can you name one objective thing that has gotten better in American society since women were given the right to vote”.  Many of the responses explicitly named objective things that have gotten better since women were given the right to vote.  You: wHy cAnT aNyOnE aNsWeR hEr qUeStIoN?   They did. This has been demonstrated to you ad nauseam and you continue to repeat the same ignorant question while also responding to answers while moving the goalposts. Stop it already. You sounds as dumb as she does.,SunnyErin8700,2023-04-24T21:48:48,3
Obviously not.  Nothing that happens in a global society of billions is solely due to any one thing.  And you know that.  But we can also clearly trace the historical rise in suffrage and women's support for various policies to broader support for those policies.  Which you also know.,Blear,2023-04-24T13:47:23,10
"Ok, so maybe we can draw a correlation.  But not a direct causation?  Women suffrage coincided with broader social changes that probably would have happened regardless",true4blue,2023-04-24T19:57:50,-1
"Sure, even if we can't prove causation (which we can), all we have are the very strongest possible correlations that social statistics can draw.  We don't know for sure if (or to what extent) some of these changes would've happened in the absence of women's suffrage.  But we know for sure that they did happen in such a way that it looks *extremely likely* that giving women the right to vote made *the very specific things they voted for* happen right after they voted for them.  And we've repeatedly done the same experiment.  This happened again and again all over the world as women won the right to vote and we see the exact same patterns of social change again and again.  The real question is why it's so difficult for you to accept something that is widely known to be true, actually proven to be true, obviously true, and virtually impossible to dispute?  This is beginning to look like a philosophical exercise with an ace t grind.  Next you'll start asking how it's possible to prove anything at all, or how we know everything isn't just an illusion.",Blear,2023-04-24T20:08:00,3
