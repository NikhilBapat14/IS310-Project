Yeah. No shit. I've been saying for this administration he'll go down in history as the 21st century Neville Chamberlain.,GhoulLordRegent,2025-05-07T06:34:17,11
Did anyone think that when Trump talked about “peace” he meant anything other than the unconditional surrender of Ukraine? I thought it was painfully obvious.,Violet-Journey,2025-05-07T21:19:14,2
What do you call pussyfooting around the insurrectionists for 4 years Joe. Fuck off forever old man,powderedmilf,2025-05-07T14:26:03,1
"Much prefer Biden to Trump, overall.  But Biden was too slow to respond to Putin's escalations, and while Biden was around, the other Euros thought they could dither.  Trump has forced those Euros to reexamine their priorities.  So as far as facts on the ground, the difference between Biden and Trump for Ukraine is not as big as the rhetoric would have some believe.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-07T06:31:49,-1
">But Biden was too slow to respond to Putin's escalations, and while Biden was around, the other Euros thought they could dither.  Trump has forced those Euros to reexamine their priorities  So Biden should have responded more directly and forcefully, but also should have responded less and backed off from the conflict in order to shift more responsibility onto European nations?  Either you try to maintain Pax Americana or you don't, you can't do both at once.",thrawtes,2025-05-07T06:36:24,12
"So, your belief is by this date, the Biden administration would have:  * Called for a ceasefire * Tell everyone that both sides need to make concessions * Apply public pressure on Ukraine to sign a 'deal', while simultaneously putting no outward pressure on Russia while it actively continues to attack Ukrainian civilian targets * Made continuous announcements of progress, only for Russia to publicaly shoot down said idea, making the US look foolish and whatever deal null and void * Made no clear indicators of what said deal entails, and how it would ensure Ukraine's future * Signed a mineral rights deal with Ukraine and then immediately announced it was scaling back its involvement in Ukraine  The absurd level of arrogance of people like you is hilarious to witness.   The 'facts on the ground' are that all Trump has achieved so far, is kick down the door, shout at everyone and gradually learn what Europe and the prior Administration already knew *years ago*, which is that Russia isn't the slightest bit interested in a ceasefire and only wants to destroy the Ukrainian government and annex the entire country.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T08:31:03,1
"I disagree with your premise that Pax Americana is the goal here.  A Putinist would think that way of course.  Biden was an old and cautious man whose feet had turned to clay.  Time and again he delayed approval of weapons systems, only to approve them later (HIMARS, ATACMS, F-16s, CMs, Abrams Tanks) with no clear benefit associated with the delays.    This criticism of Biden is legitimate.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-07T06:52:23,-1
"Huge straw man there, which was a complete waste of time for you to write and post.  It is possible to criticize Biden for a lack of strategic daring to match his moral clarity.  Read the history books and tell me if caution in warfare is generally rewarded, or not.  Hint....it is not.  Trump by contrast has no morality whatsoever, and exhibits biases that appear sourced from some long-standing KGB/FSB influence program.  We are left hoping that his mercurial, contrarian streak will lash out against the Putinist wing in his own entourage, and against Putin himself.  The rotten luck is that these were the only two choices.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-07T08:41:41,1
"Your point being that he should have approved those weapons immediately or never, and that his failure was choosing a route in between instead of being decisive?",thrawtes,2025-05-07T06:57:51,1
"You're the one making the absurd claim the Biden and Trump administrations behavior are identical, so no, not a complete waste of time, because its always worth reminding an idiot that they're an idiot when the choose to open their mouth and say idiotic things.  For the U.S., this is not traditional warfare, its economic warfare, which was working. Ukraine was holding the line while Russia had to cannibalize its economy, converting it into a wartime economy. It's claiming its GDP is up, and growth is stable, while its economy is becoming increasingly dependent on public spending, and that spending is going into things that immediately get obliterated on the battlefield by the very weapons we were supplying Ukraine with.  Trump, meanwhile, is releasing the pressure valve in a multitude of ways, giving Russia an opportunity to overwhelm Ukraine before its economy collapses.  Pro-tip: using multi-syllabic word salad doesn't make you sound smart.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T08:48:19,1
"My point seems abundantly clear.  Delivery of weapons systems were delayed, and reasons for those delays are unpersuasive.  I think I see hints of Pentagon bureaucracy and arrogance in there.   Ukrainians for example have been criticized for being slow to master Western-style mobile warfare.  But how that is supposed to work without airpower to suppress fortified defenses is never explained.  The truth be told, the military headquarters in all Western capitols should be recognized as big Government Office Buildings full of government bureaucrats.  But the buck stops with Biden.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-07T08:25:57,-1
No it isn’t. You are ignoring every time the republicans voted against funding for Ukraine because orange daddy tweeted something.  Blaming the stalled Ukrainian aid on Biden alone just shows you don’t actually pay attention to politics and get your information from one propaganda source,Cyndakill88,2025-05-07T08:44:10,2
"Okay go back and reread my posts and see what is there, not what you want to see.  I give Biden points for moral clarity.  Much good flows from that.  I ding him for delaying on delivery of weapons systems that did much good once they were finally deployed.  The choice to delay was on the administration.  Maybe it was Pentagon generals getting it wrong, but the buck stops with the man in charge.  The F-16 delay was the worst one.  Did the Pentagon argue that the platform would not be useful?  No, rather that the learning curve was too long.  So they delayed approvals of European transfers (wasn't even US jets) that would allow aircrew and ground crew training to proceed.  That was completely incompetent management, and water under the bridge.  It is legitimate to criticize the failings of Biden to adequately support Ukraine, independent of whatever the eff it is that Trump is doing right now.  And before that I would criticize Obama and W for failing to see Putin for what he was.  As for Trump, the sad state is that we are left hoping that a blind squirrel finds an acorn, maybe as a result of an autocrats' quarrel.",TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-05-07T09:26:45,1
