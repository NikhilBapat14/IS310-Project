In a parlamentary system the Head of State represents the political system stability. In that system the prime minister can stay in Power for years or even days. That's why it wouldnt make the PM be the Head of State. But a president can be elected by Congress like It happens in south africa.,Available-Attitude61,2022-09-29T21:12:14,2
"The monarch being the head of state in the UK is mostly ceremonial. I mean, Churchill went to Potsdam and Yalta. He delivered the Iron Curtain speech in the US midwest. It was Blair that met with Bush to discuss the Iraq War. The list goes on. For all intents and purposes of actual governance, the PM is the Head of State.  And I think it's kind of silly to suggest that the UK and its commonwealth partners aren't republics. Yes, there is a monarchy that nominally is at the top of the org chart, so to speak, but the king doesn't have any real power, and all thing related to politics, governance, legislation, etc are connected to standard republican structures. The constitutional monarchy is a republic already.  But yeah, if you wanted to abolish the monarchy you very much could. The king doesn't actually wield power by design, but operates more a legitimacy-building structure. But if the people no longer want a king, they could get rid of the king without impacting their political system hardly at all.",mormagils,2022-09-29T09:17:09,1
"It's not, ""Westminster parliamentary system"" merely refers to that the system was designed based on how Westminster was designed. But a country with such a system could change the rules to eliminate the distinction between Head of State and Head of Government entirely. The UK did it because of how their government evolved, i.e. the King was originally all powerful but started to loose power overtime until they have the system today. Tomorrow the UK could change the rules to eliminate the monarchy all together and the concept of a ""Head of State"" effectively putting that position to the Prime Minister.",avatoin,2022-10-17T13:56:55,1
"It's not. South Africa and Botswana both have a parliamentary systems without requiring a monarch/governor-general/ceremonial president. They call their leaders ""President"", but they still get their power by commanding the most seats in the legislature.",[deleted],2022-10-25T11:42:03,1

This would be fully true, except the House of Lords still exists and the hereditary lords within it have some influence on legislation, just based on their birthright. They are republics in practice, but with aristocratic and feudal elements.",ThatVander,2022-10-03T15:40:55,1
"Thanks for all the informative replies, guys!  I now know there are parliamentary systems without a HoS. Interesting.",xar987,2022-11-12T20:48:44,1
"Eh, even then, that's not really fair. Lords has been severely reformed over the years. The body is no longer hereditary, though it is appointed to life terms. The body also has had its legislative roles strictly reduced in accordance with its non-elected nature. It can introduce bills, sure, and does have the power to essentially reject a bill...though Commons can simply override that rejection in many cases anyway.  In essence, Lords is today's incarnation is much more similar to the SCOTUS than the US Senate. If Lords makes the UK not a republic, then I would say the SCOTUS does the same for the US.",mormagils,2022-10-03T15:55:32,1
