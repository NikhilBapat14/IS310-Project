"> The company said the idling of two Pennsylvania plants, one in Steelton and one in Conshohocken, and one in Riverdale, Illinois, is due to “insufficient demand and pricing” and nothing to do with President Donald Trump's tariffs.  i mean how much more evidence do you need that manufacturing is never going to come back to the us if they can't even get enough business to stay open *before* the tariffs really kick in?",oh-shazbot,2025-05-04T10:28:49,15

We are quickly reaching the event horizon from no coming back from this insanity. EU & Pacific nations WILL go to China for steel & never come back - same for many agricultural & industrial goods. Make America Third World.,DraganTaveley,2025-05-04T10:02:57,4

"What is more telling is how much these companies are afraid of Trump. Like how much does he have to make you lose in order to stand up to him. Maybe they’re hoping for a bail out or government contract. Good luck with that, the GOP and Trump don’t give handouts for free. Look how quick Amazon caved when Trump found out they would put tariff prices on products. They bent the knee quick.",RedTheRobot,2025-05-04T13:41:27,5
"What’s even more odd is further down they talk about idling iron mines and a plant in Dearborn due to automotive demand, then follow that up by saying they hope the long term impact of the tariffs will revive this business for them.   I think they’re just lying and calling second order impacts from the tariffs not a tariff cause because it’s indirect not direct for them specifically.",fyreprone,2025-05-04T16:18:30,4

Much of steel production is automated. It takes less than one third the man power to create metal products today than it did 50 years ago. Much like mining as well. Now the buyers of these raw materials down stream (consumer goods) are the ones reducing orders.,williamgman,2025-05-04T10:54:35,3

Most steel workers would blow sweet potato Hitler even if he clearly cost them their jobs and homes. Trump still has no clue how much damage he is causing. While watching the Derby yesterday it was mentioned that Churchill has cancelled the $1 billion dollar project to rebuild the track citing impact of tariffs on building material costs and the expectation that the US economy will continue to implode Thanks to the Trump dump. Kentucky really needed that project and Trump killed it.,Suitable-Ratio,2025-05-04T16:20:45,2
"I'd wager that at least 5% of those folks will either stay home or vote Dem next time. It's a small and sad number, but with margin of victory being tiny the past few elections, it may just be enough.  I've seen a lot of strange shit these past two decades of politics, but NOTHING would be stranger than a political party decimating the economy, but still retaining power in the next elections.  It's simply not something that happens.",ts_wrathchild,2025-05-04T14:37:28,1
"Here is the problem, you are thinking of the MAGA as a political party but it is a cult. There are also going to be dems that don’t vote because they will feel the party didn’t stand up to Trump enough. So that 5% won’t mean anything.   During the election my grandmother told me there is no way Trump could win. I told her I wasn’t so sure of that because of what I was seeing and reading online. Sure enough he won. You are looking at politics as she looks at it, someone being smart enough to call a liar, a liar. Other people aren’t that smart. They want to be part of a group or movement even if they are wrong. Just like flat earthers. So no matter how much they are proven wrong they will never admit it because then they would lose their friends or their group. So they will continue to kick the can and blame the dem. Trump will be blaming Biden until the end of his term.",RedTheRobot,2025-05-04T14:54:54,3
