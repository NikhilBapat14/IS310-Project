"David French (conservative commentator) stated this best. Trump knows he can not run a third time, but his only leverage over politicians on the right is the threat of his threat. When he says that he'll run again, it's there to maintain that leverage over his Republican colleagues.   Republican rule must maintain leaders above all else. They must be infallible. For those unaware, Reagan had an 11th Commandment, ""Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican."" That is still taken very seriously in Republican circles.   French also had great commentary on the politics of Trump. Trump's supporters demand that you take him seriously, not literally. Trump's detractors (oftentimes in the press) demanded that you take him literally, not seriously. I'm this second administration, Trump is showing that you should treat him both ways, literally and seriously. He means everything he says, but the law is clear on it.",Abzug,2025-05-04T09:12:43,1
