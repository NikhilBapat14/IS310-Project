I just wonder how that lawyer would feel if it was his close family members who were starving in Gaza.  Would he really still be saying the same thing?,crazybones,2025-04-30T15:46:00,5

"> Trump said he told Israel’s prime minister: “We have got to be good to Gaza.”  That sounds about as feckless as ‘Vladimir. STOP’’   Astonishing that millions of Americans see him as their strong, powerful leader. A man who ‘fell in love’ with NK’s ‘Rocket Man’ and can’t get the ‘Coolest Dictator’ to return a wrongfully deported Venezuelan. And whatever happened to all those who were so concerned about Palestinians that they protested Harris? That’s right. Crickets.",__dilligaf__,2025-04-30T16:48:35,2
"Have you no humanity,  have you no compassion for your fellow human beings ,  ""https://poets.org/poem/merchant-venice-act-iv-scene-i-quality-mercy-not-strained  The quality of mercy is not strained; It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest; It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: 'T is mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown: His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, The attribute to awe and majesty, Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; But mercy is above this sceptred sway; It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings, It is an attribute to God himself; And earthly power doth then show likest God's When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, Though justice be thy plea, consider this, That, in the course of justice, none of us Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea; Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.",Jaded_Cicada_7614,2025-04-30T18:24:27,0
