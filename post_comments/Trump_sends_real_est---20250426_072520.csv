He doesn‚Äôt regard Putin as a bad guy. He liked him.   This is gross. He‚Äôs a dictator who murders anyone willing to oppose his rule. Which I guess is exactly what the idiots that voted for Trump want‚Ä¶,Bulldogs3144,2025-04-26T08:13:05,40
"MY god, what a debacle.  Diplomacy is never carried out like this, it's a farce and it's all in favour of Russia.  Trump sends his buddy--it should be Rubio minimum--just in case there isn't total submission to Russia.  And while here""let's do some business!""     At least CNN is now reporting what is really going on and calling it ouot for what it is.",Weakera,2025-04-26T08:19:50,21

"The biggest diplomatic farce in history  [Russia Expands Global Outreach for Program Linked to Drone Production](https://archive.ph/2025.04.25-053420/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/russia-expands-outreach-for-youth-work-program-linked-to-drone-production)  As the war in Ukraine saps the country of its workforce, young women are being internationally recruited to work in factories known to produce kamikaze drones.  April 25, 2025    On a Saturday afternoon earlier this month, about 60 people, young women and their parents, gathered in an auditorium at the University of Botswana to listen to several of their countrymen exhort them to pack up and move almost 6,000 miles (9,600 kilometers) away to the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia. Over fried chicken from a local Gaborone fast-food joint, attendees were pitched what was billed as a work-study program in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, an industrial complex 12 hours east of Moscow dedicated to mechanical engineering and the production of Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. Fliers and promotional materials for the program featured images of smiling young African women working as technicians and waitresses",No_Clue_7894,2025-04-26T09:38:27,9

They think international diplomacy and peace negotiations are the same as playing the confidence game to convince a bank to extend you another loan on a real estate project.   It's not.,revveduplikeaduece86,2025-04-26T10:22:18,1
