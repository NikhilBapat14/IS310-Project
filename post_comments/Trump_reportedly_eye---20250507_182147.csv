And there 150 vacant Superintendent positions. The budget proposal calls for dropping “small” parks. The National Park Service and System is being destroyed by teenagers and know-nothings.

"This article is incorrect.  I'm sad to say that Trump's budget request to congress requested a *$900 MILLION* reduction to the NPS' budget.  He wants to put the park service back to 90s levels of funding, and his request explicitly mentions that he wants to turn a bunch of sites over 'to the states.'  This is in addition to congress looking to pass cuts to federal employee benefits, including retroactive changes to the pension plans that people have already signed up for.  The pension was already made kinda garbage back in the 80s.  The House also wants to switch the Federal employee health insurance system over to a voucher system.",TheDamDog,2025-05-07T21:41:50,19
