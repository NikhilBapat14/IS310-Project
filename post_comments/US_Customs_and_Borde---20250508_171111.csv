"US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has quietly rescinded several internal policies that were designed to protect some of the most vulnerable people in its custody—including pregnant women, infants, the elderly, and those with serious medical conditions.  The decision, [outlined in a memo](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/2025-05/intc-45073_-_ac1_signed_distribution_memo_5.5.25.pdf) dated May 5 and signed by Acting Commissioner Pete Flores, eliminates four Biden era policies enacted over the last three years. These policies were intended to address CBP’s long-standing failures to provide adequate care for detainees who are most at risk—failures that have, in some cases, proved fatal.  The May 5 memo was distributed internally to top agency leadership but was not announced publicly.  CBP justified the rollback by stating in the memo–titled Rescission of Legacy Policies Related to Care and Custody–that the policies were “obsolete” and “misaligned” with the agency’s current enforcement priorities.  Together, the now-rescinded policies laid out standards for detainees with heightened medical needs—requiring, for instance, access to water and food for pregnant people, ensuring privacy for breastfeeding mothers, and mandating diapers and unexpired formula be stocked in holding facilities. They also instructed agents to process at-risk individuals as quickly as possible to limit time in custody.

I've been saying this was coming. We keep hearing and following all the men being detained and deported. Where is the overwhelming headlines for individual women and children's stories? People can't stomach the mess they created so it's kept under wraps.,Aggravating-Bunch-44,2025-05-08T17:24:32,10
"Pregnant women and infants have their rights revoked? Once again, this has the ghoulish fingerprints of Stephen Miller all over it. He truly is an anti-Christian. When he hears ""Do unto the least of us"", he goes for the absolute most vulnerable by targeting children, including cancer patients, and their mothers. This administration is one of the most revolting in American history for its cruelty.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-08T17:29:29,11

"It’s a scam. There are hospitals on the Mexican side that can deal with it. But it gets worse. Chinese are sending frozen embryos to Mexico to impregnate surrogates. The surrogate gets across the border to the deliver the baby to get American citizenship. Then the real parents come to the US to pick up the baby. When they want to move to the US the baby is the ticket,",That-Resort2078,2025-05-08T18:20:17,-12
