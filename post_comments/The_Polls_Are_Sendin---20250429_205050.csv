"So what he'll do next... is have the pollsters investigated, say they lie, and then issue an executive order stating pollsters are no longer allowed to conduct polls that look bad for him...¬† any of that sound accurate?",ultralightdude,2025-04-29T20:53:10,32
The polls should send the Republican party a message to impeach and remove the traitor.,BukkitCrab,2025-04-29T21:05:56,10
He obviously doesn't care. And given the solid loyalty that the GOP are giving him in Congress it doesn't seem that they're very concerned either.¬†   And why should they be? Anyone who thinks we're going to have any kind of a normal election in 2026 is living in some kind of dreamland.¬†¬†¬† We are living in a fascist police state and fascist police states don't allow proper Democratic elections.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T21:07:27,12

"And his response was to hold a rally for the rabid cult and throw tons of red meat to make then even more rabid.  Trump is a megalomaniac, period, and he will not step aside, admit fault, take responsibility, nothing approaching a leader because all he cares about is power and well, himself.",2cigsaday,2025-04-29T21:16:57,4
