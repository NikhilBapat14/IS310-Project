"Republicans need to realize that MTG is who they are.¬† And if they're not okay with that, they need to leave the GOP and stop identifying as Republicans, and start voting against the GOP, until it changes its ways.   But of course, they're not worried about who they are, or what they're doing to this country.¬† ¬†They're concerned about whether or not they'll be in charge.¬† ¬†They want to have power, and they'll figure out what to do with it when they get there.",GaimeGuy,2025-05-07T11:37:25,1638

"Call this a conspiracy theory (which seems appropriate for any MTG story), but I think she's using all this ""Primary"" talk to get what she really wants: a place in the Trump cabinet.  She's been coveting one of those spots since his first term and hasn't been shy about it.  Time and time again she's been passed over.  So now she's essentially threatening to guarantee the Dem Senate seat for another 6 years or to flip Georgia's governorship blue for 4 - 8 years unless she's convinced not to run.    She wants something more than her little political district in rural Georgia.  She wants a true seat at the table.  This is her chance to get it; not with an election, but with the threat of ruining an election.  Again, just a conspiracy theory, but it seems to fit her standard operating mode.",Nythoren,2025-05-07T12:11:20,211

Kemp tried to move himself to the center when running for his second term and basically cut refund checks and gave bonuses to educators two years in a row to do it.

DeKalb has a threshold of 80/20, Gwinnett recently flipped Blue in 2018 iirc, but Dems consistently win by 10ish. Keeping it around that number is necessary.  MTG only won her district, which is HEAVILY gerrymandered, by 90k votes. I‚Äôm not saying she can‚Äôt win, but I‚Äôd be surprised if the North Fulton County types actually vote for her.

They've controlled the house for almost 70% of the time since then and the senate for half the time since then.  They continued along the same trajectory to Trump, and have maintained the course of turning this country into a theocratic fascist hell hole through plague, and the country has rewarded them for it.

"Nope.  They heard Trump promise deep tariffs - Knowing that would do economic damage, dramatically drive up inflation and drive the USA into a recession - Maybe even a depression. And voted for him.  They heard Trump promise to deport millions knowing that would crater agriculture, meat packing, construction and many other industries dependent on cheap labour. And voted for him.  They heard him promise to further slash taxes for billionaires, further driving the deficit beyond the Trillion dollar mark he took it last time. And voted for him.  They may call themselves  ""pro business"" Republicans, but they're MAGA, just like every other person who votes Republican. They can try to pretend they're ""classic Republicans"" but they're just deluding themselves.",StoreSearcher1234,2025-05-07T21:36:35,1

Even most of his voters aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúMAGA.‚Äù They just hate democratic policies (or rather, the caricature of them they‚Äôve been misled to believing is true). A lot of his voters are like the people I interact with every day.

The receptionist at my chiropractor makes $25 an hour, there is a labor shortage in the metro but there is a lack of housing which is holding back people moving here.  Now goto Thomasville and it's a completely opposite story just like the rest of the US.    You probably don't know but under Kemp Georgia has had 4 new car plants built to where Georgia will be one of the top 5 car manufacturing states in the US going forward.",Aman_Syndai,2025-05-08T06:15:58,1

"Of course the founding fathers were elite. They were coming off 800 years of monarchical rule.  However, with Washington's rejection of a military-supported monarchy, it was a step forward.  GW was a ""small r"" republican to his core.   I didn't say Nixon or Reagan were good Presidents or that they weren't conservatives.  Of course they were conservatives. I said they emerged from modest backgrounds, which is not consistent with your suggestion that the party was advocating for elites to rule.    MAGA has many bedfellows but one organizing principle: obstruct the left.  Trump garnered a lot of votes from working-class voters who are not advocates of the ruling elite.  Quite the opposite.  MAGA gained a lot of power by whipping up hysteria over elites ruling.    Trump has leveraged the hysteria and is creating a Putin-style patronage government.  That is most definitely a new development.  Spiro Agnew resigned the Vice Presidency over a $10k kickback.  Nixon was forced to resign for covering up Watergate.  Trump is more mafia boss than President.",direwolf71,2025-05-07T17:54:56,2
