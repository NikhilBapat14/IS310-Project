"LA is pretty slow right now. We usually have cargo ships holding out at the Channel Islands waiting for their time to arrive in port. They were using the Navy Base it was so busy, not this week.",Morepastor,2025-05-02T09:07:29,5
"The $10 billion container shipping industry, the one that moves boxes full of everything and anything around global seas, has this phenomenon called “blank sailings.”  To understand the term of art, think of the world-spanning ocean-bound trade economy like a bus system, where several buses—or ships—are making stops along a set route. If the people running the bus system—or the shipping company—realize there’s not enough passenger demand for their bus to run the route in the middle of the day, they’ll cancel one of those circuits. Same with shipping companies: If they realize there aren’t enough bookings to justify a container ship running its standard route, the company will “blank” the sailing, combining the goods that were supposed to be on that ship with those traveling later in the week.  This is normal shipping stuff. But not this month. As the effects of President Donald Trump’s [new tariffs on foreign goods](https://www.wired.com/tag/tariffs/)—and [the trade war they’ve ignited](https://www.wired.com/story/uncanny-valley-podcast-trump-tariffs-end-of-christmas/)—set in, many shippers who usually send goods across the Pacific Ocean have paused or canceled their shipments. Data from the supply-chain research firm Sea-Intelligence [shows that blank sailings](https://www.sea-intelligence.com/press-room/320-transpacific-blank-sailings-rise-rapidly) to the US’s West Coast spiked 13 percent this week, and is due to jump to 28 percent the week after. The Port of Los Angeles, the nation’s largest, expects [17 total blank sailings in May](https://kentico.portoflosangeles.org/getmedia/d4b7e22d-c26f-452f-9f70-35faf17a0e4c/blank-sailings), which means the port will lose 224,000 “twenty-foot equivalent units of capacity,” the standard metric used to measure the contents in one container. In total, the [port’s data shows](https://volumes.portoptimizer.com/), import volumes will be down 31 percent next week compared to the same week last year.container shipping industry, the one that moves boxes full of everything and anything around global seas, has this phenomenon called “blank sailings.”  Read more: [https://www.wired.com/story/maritime-shipping-tariffs-blank-sailings/](https://www.wired.com/story/maritime-shipping-tariffs-blank-sailings/)",wiredmagazine,2025-05-02T08:39:35,4

The good news is that container ships are huge polluters and major sources of ocean noise that disrupts the behavior of marine mammals.      A downturn in the economy could be good for the environment. Although it would hardly offset the environmental damage that Trump is doing in many other ways.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T13:52:26,-2
