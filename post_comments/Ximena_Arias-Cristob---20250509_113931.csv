"During the campaign, trump went on and on and on about people who were murdered by immigrants, and there was tons of fearmongering about ""migrant crime"" (even though it was exaggerated). He and his administration keep talking about gang members, rapists, murderers, violent thugs... and yet, here we are, with a young woman being arrested for going right on red and her father for going six miles over the speed limit.  The government is spending my tax dollars to detain nonviolent people in awful conditions for indefinite periods of time, and then deport them. These people don't deserve to be treated this way. And for what? Are they a threat? I'm an American citizen. Am I supposed to be happy that I'm being protected from this horrible, evil monster who turned right on red???  What I hate is that the people who do these arrests and deportations, and people who support them, never have to actually experience this detention themselves. They don't have to be trapped for indefinite periods of time in physically painful conditions, separated from family, not knowing what will happen to them next. So to people who support this, this is no big deal. The cruelty isn't directed at them, so they don't care. I'm so tired of people like this and their ""not my problem"" attitude.",sachiprecious,2025-05-09T12:05:29,21
"""Stewart Detention Center (SDC), which is about four hours from Dalton in Lumpkin, is one of the largest and most well-known immigration detention facilities in the U.S. It is operated by private prison company CoreCivic.""  ""A report from the ACLU, which previously condemned the facility for poor conditions and due process violations, says that at least 10 people died there between 2017 and 2024.""  This is how the German SA started out. The difference is they are using for profit private prisons now. Note that the 2A extends to legal green card holding residents. She has no rights or second chances now. If a group of men show up without identification in unmarked vehicles... With face covered... Assume your life is on the line.",williamgman,2025-05-09T11:44:18,18

"Guess what - if I lived in say Japan or Swtizerland illegally since I was 4 and then caught as an adult, guess what - they would detain me.  Democrats only care about illegals because they a ton of new democrat voters if any sort of amnesty gets passed.  Just like how California was turned from blue to red by Reagan's disastrous amnesty for illegals.",box-cable,2025-05-09T11:51:59,-33
I can think of a lot more 'nightmare' conditions than just being overcrowded and lot of crying. That's basically like being at NYC during Christmas.,iuthnj34,2025-05-09T11:45:42,-36
