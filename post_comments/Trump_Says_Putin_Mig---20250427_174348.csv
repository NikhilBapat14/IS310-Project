"It's possible that Trump has had to come around to this conclusion.  If you're angry at him for trying to provide peace and come up with a lasting settlement, you're the problem, not Trump.  But providing weapons to Ukraine, from a strategic point of view, bleeds Russia to the point of near-collapse.  But it comes at a fiscal cost and it drains Ukrainian blood, so I can understand Trump's motivation to bring it to an end.  I am not opposed to either situation, but I've been of the mind that Russia would not accept any reasonable peace, and therefore we must give them war since, quoting William Tecumseh Sherman.  >War is the remedy our enemies have chosen. Other simple remedies were within their choice. You know it and they know it, but they wanted war, and I say let us give them all they want; not a word of argument, not a sign of let up, no cave in till we are whipped or they are.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-27T17:55:08,88
"Ukraine continues to hit Russia. Russia responds. Trump hits back on Russia.   Seriously, sick and tired of one sided propaganda. Same things happened when Ukraine broke ceasefires over and over and blamed Russia.   I think at this point, to stop the war, that lunatic president in Ukraine needs to go. The guy made it clear he doesn’t want to stop the war and will only make Ukraine lose more lives. He can’t even sign a mineral deal that is prepared for over a week.   Say what you will about Russia, we all know they are the enemy in this, but the fascist Ukrainian government is only making the situation worse. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-27T19:01:51,-393
"Yes, I personally think a deal where Europe pays for all the equipment we authorize sounds like a solid plan. Everyone wins except Putin.",LemartesIX,2025-04-27T22:14:42,21
"Russia can tolerate the losses in men far better than Ukraine.  If it comes down to a war of attrition, Ukraine will lose.",WIlf_Brim,2025-04-28T07:58:57,4

"Russia invaded Ukraine and they’re avoiding backing away. If any other country invaded the US, would you give up land for “peace” even though someone else started it? No.  Don’t be a bootlicker for the Russians, Putin is a dictator that needs to go.",stniesen,2025-04-27T23:54:37,316

"There is another option, which is political will.  Ukraine has the motivation of self-preservation.  Losing means a loss of at least a large portion of the nation, and being more or less a puppet state of Russia.  Russia, on the other hand, has more to lose, but the gains are not apparent to the regular people, the common soldiers, or basically anyone except Putin, high-level government officials, and the oligarchs.  If the army or the oligarchs all at once turn on Putin, he will fall.  On top of that, Russia's economy isn't strong, neither do they have an endless stream of artillery or tanks.  America and NATO nations have been throwing better technology at Ukraine, and they have been hitting artillery and tanks at a rate where there is a point where it will dry out.  The measure isn't just man for man, though that may end up being the difference.  The Russian army or oligarchs might-well see no more benefit of putting up with Putin and remove him.  Or the economy might just collapse and there won't be anymore money to spend, to build or buy ammunition, pay soldiers, or maintain the infrastructure to effectively attack, or the Russians might just run out of equipment to fight, and be sitting ducks as American/European equipment wipes them out like sitting ducks.",thatrightwinger,2025-04-28T11:13:38,5
"Because they're Russian bots. And what I mean by that is they're either literal bots, intentional Russian actors, or hapless parrots of Russian propaganda without being aware.  Either way, the term bot is apt.",tragiktimes,2025-04-28T06:30:23,123
