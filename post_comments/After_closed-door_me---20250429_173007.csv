"Oklahoma schools will now be required to teach ""irregularities"" in the 2020 election. The state superintendent, a Trump sycophant, slipped in these new standards that would be implemented by default unless the legislature voted it down. After the state GOP met with Walters, they decided to not even bring it to the floor. On top of costing an extra 33 million, this bill was wildly unpopular because the man who changed the social studies standards did so on his own, even circumventing the board of Education to do so.",houstonman6,2025-04-29T17:45:39,3
