"If sexism and racism are to blame, then why didn't Biden just stay in the race?",AndForeverNow,2025-05-08T18:57:04,316

Seems about Democrat  Victim mentality,Rubentraj,2025-05-08T19:13:53,159
She lost because she was one of the worst Presidential candidates ever and came from a train wreck known as the Biden administration.,Trondkjo,2025-05-08T20:17:15,71
"Republicans rejected her policies in 2024. Democrats rejected her person in the 2019 primaries. They picked the old white guy with the same beliefs over the younger, black woman. So who is more likely to be racist in this scenario?",JurassicParkFood,2025-05-08T18:59:45,158
Being black (half) and a woman helped her. Think about all the media love and money she received. It just wasn‚Äôt enough to overcome how terrible she was.,JTuck333,2025-05-08T19:49:41,37
I had forgotten about Joe Biden entirely for a moment.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-08T18:44:16,50

"Great, it‚Äôs Hillary 2.0",longshanks44,2025-05-08T18:36:12,39
"Ugh. Hardly anyone cares about her race, we've already had a black president. Hardly anyone cares about her being a woman, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in 2016. Harris sucked. No one voted for her to be the candidate in the primaries before and then this time she was just put in without votes either.   Joe's age is less of a concern (still hate the ages of most government lately) and his cognitive ability is more what we're worried about. He could be 30 years old and it wouldn't change a damn thing about my opinion of him if he acted the same.   He's out of touch. The perfect democrat.",duckfruits,2025-05-08T21:56:08,12
"Oh please keep doing this, Democrats! Keep quintupling down on this as the reason you lost! It will CERTAINLY help you do better next time!  /s",superduperm1,2025-05-08T18:34:05,78
I know shoeonhead is a sore spot for conservatives and leftists but she explained it all perfectly and theres still lefties out there that refuse to accept why they lost against someone they thought americans would say never again.,Katzchen12,2025-05-08T19:16:20,43
"Both Barrack Obama and Hilary Clinton won the popular vote... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Democrats need to cut the crap and take a long hard look at themselves, I hope they don't, but they definitely should if they don't want to keep losing.",According-Activity87,2025-05-08T20:34:32,18
"Joe just hasn't been unburdened by what has been yet, he'll understand after lol.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-08T19:49:04,10
"Still hasn't learned...none of them have. It's the entire MO of the left; shift the blame from themselves to everyone else: ""We would have won if people weren't so racist..."" I'm tired of it, but I needn't be; they lost, and will continue to as long as they keep this up. I thank God that Americans woke up to it; I greatly feared they wouldn't.",maitlandia,2025-05-08T22:00:33,7
"I heard a joke that most black men voted Trump because they already had a nagging, shrew of a black woman as their wife/partner at home and ddn't need another one lecturing them 24/7 on the news.",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-05-08T19:04:31,38

Sexism and racism? How would that be possible? She's neither male or white! üòÅ,Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-05-08T20:10:40,9
"Democrats lost comprehensively in 2024 because their track record, their policies/ideology AND their standard bearers all sucked complete and total ass. If they only blame their loss on the latter, they're deluding themselves and are in for a rude awakening in 2028.",Black_XistenZ,2025-05-09T02:52:53,4

We still gonna think that is the reason? Sure. Keep making that excuse. Keep running on fear and hysteria about racism and sexism. Call voters garbage. Offer no solutions. Do cream puff interviews or just flat out avoid them.  Keep running this campaign like that. Age? Oh ya that's right all that video was AI and editing. I forgot. Even that debate. Yep that's all this was.,Crisgocentipede,2025-05-09T00:05:19,3

"It wasn't sexism or racism. She would have been Biden 2.0, and I didn't like the white male Biden 1.0. I actually think she did better than he would have.",Phenzo2198,2025-05-09T02:51:43,1

"Well i saw another headline saying Biden thinks he would have won if Harris didnt run. I'm not one to just read headlines and take them at face value, but i wouldn't be surprised if he said that after reading this article.",DannyDootch,2025-05-09T06:33:47,11

"Lefty side of democratic party line.    Democrats ignored Corey Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobachar, Andrew Yang, and any other minority choice. They chose old, Joe Biden. If that's not racism, then me choosing my party vs a woman from a party I've never voted for certainly isn't racism",JurassicParkFood,2025-05-08T19:29:31,61
There's a lot about Dementia Biden I'd like to forget.,GiediOne,2025-05-08T20:18:08,14
Sure and she didn‚Äôt have policies either. Like actual ideas she could specifically put into place.  There was nothing but identity to vote on with her. And nobody wanted it.,Sregor_Nevets,2025-05-09T03:59:22,8
"Well they didn‚Äôt really chose Biden. A lot of people didn‚Äôt have a choice. I really don‚Äôt understand how the voting during primaries is considered fair. A lot of people I know in CA voted for Yang. By the time their ballots were counted Yang had dropped even though he was popular. Therefore those people‚Äôs votes were void and wasted since they cant cast another vote when its their turn during primaries and their candidate dropped out.¬†  If I were one of those voters, I would have left the party but it‚Äôs their vote, they keep supporting the party that manipulates and nulls their voting rights.¬†",Blahblahnownow,2025-05-09T09:44:35,1
