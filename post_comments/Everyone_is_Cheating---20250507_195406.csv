"Over 20 years ago, as a math major...  I showed up one day about 20 minutes early for my linear algebra class and found 15 or so people passing around a paper. While I'd been at home trying to do the 4 homework proofs myself  and spending hours to finish, I found out there was a better way. 4 students would go to teachers hours, get 1 question explained and answered, and then share it with everyone else.   This is how I did my homework for the next three years. I learned a lot from correcting logical and copying errors while copying the answers.",apollyon_53,2025-05-07T23:13:51,16
"Today, a college education is nothing more than a 'license to work', and there are facts to back this up.  About 70% of all people have a position that has nothing to do with their major. The degree is only proof that you are teachable, that there is a good chance that you have the capacity to learn your job in the company. Nothing more.....  I know many people that have a PhD.  While they are very knowledgeable in one particular subject area, they tend to be an 'idiot savant' - they aren't very knowledgeable in any other subject matter.  (PhD stands for ""Push here, Dummy"")",bjohn15151515,2025-05-08T10:07:32,3
">Everyone Is Cheating Their Way Through College: ChatGPT has unraveled the entire academic project. ‚Äì New York Magazine  I'm old enough to remember the *'can AI get through school'* challenge.  So when do we start automating the sprawling offices of bureaucratic staffers? Not just in government offices, schools could cost less and healthcare could cost less by trimming down the number of people who aren't teaching aren't practicing medicine but cost money anyway.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-08T00:38:55,3
"It‚Äôs definitely not useless, it gets your foot in the door. I will say college  has become so popular so a BS is just a little piece of paper, you need a MS/MBA to really grow",Rubentraj,2025-05-08T06:16:09,2
Unless you wanna be a Dr stay away from college.,VegasAireGuy,2025-05-07T20:07:03,-7
"We don‚Äôt need to be good/bad for college.  Absolutely a shit degree is a shit degree.    Two of my kids are engineers, those degrees paid off big time.  Anothe is an attorney, her degree paid off big time.  One is in sales, for the start of her career she didn‚Äôt need a degree,  but she‚Äôs been promoted to national sales manager for her product category, and that position absolutely requires a degree.  Not just as a paper requirement, but she‚Äôs leaned hard into her accounting, stats, marketing, and more of her education.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T21:12:55,23
Great for them if they know what they want to do and engineers are the best bang for the buck in college these days.    I make 150 ish a year and no college what so ever just have a mechanical mind that gets me thru.,VegasAireGuy,2025-05-07T21:15:27,-1

"I love the down-votes you received from mindless drivels of people, who believe that college is the only way to a successful life.  However, society would crumble into disarray without the trades - no electricity, no plumbing, no building of anything.  All the college-educated fools, sitting in their cubicles would have no purpose in life if there was no electricity, plumbing, or internet. Facts are facts.  I am somewhat of an anomaly. I have nothing more than an Associates in General Studies degree (pretty worthless), yet I'm a Lead Consultant in Business Processes and Automation through sales software platforms.  So, I have a remote desk job.  While I can code software, I also enjoy turning wrenches on a car, install, and repair electrical and plumbing in my house. I know full well the value of all people in the trades. They keep the world running and you have my deepest respect.",bjohn15151515,2025-05-08T10:00:35,3
