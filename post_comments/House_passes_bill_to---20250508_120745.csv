"embaressing this is the shit we waste time on  no one is calling it that, no one will teach it like that and in 2-4 years it will go back to what it's been called for 100s of years  how pathetic and thin skinned of a racist do you have to be to complain about the name of a body of water that was called that before your grandparents were even born",snakebit1995,2025-05-08T12:22:59,1

"BIG win for conservatives. Respecting heritage with old, established names is a big deal in the American south. This really is Trump's wheelhouse of ability--putting names on things is his biggest business achievement. Americans will definitely be feeling the effects, in such a big way.  This, this is what having Republican majorities in the House, Senate, Supreme Court ideological alignment, and the presidency is all about.",localistand,2025-05-08T12:20:41,1
