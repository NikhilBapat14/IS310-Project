"Isn't that a Trump voters' favorite holiday? Bummer.  Hopefully, they can still afford their weenies and hamberders.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-01T08:48:49,19

"I honestly can't imagine celebrating July 4th this year.  I always loved the fact that it was right around my birthday.  Thanks to the Schmuck -In-Chief, I'm just hoping I still have a goddamned job.  Happy Birthday, America.",JacquoRock,2025-05-01T09:26:20,10

"I realize there is probably a lot of different factors that go into the production of fireworks for our celebratory events but it does boggle the mind that we depend on other countries for something that is, in this country, almost entirely associated with our independence as a nation. If there was one market you think we should have been able to corner by now and find a cost effective way of producing it would be this. I mean we love blowing things up ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.¬†",Careful-Flatworm391,2025-05-01T09:03:13,-1
"I live in a tiny town in the southern Midwest. One family owns most everything here. And they made their fortune by importing fireworks from China.   I know they're all trump supporters because they hang his signs. I'm interested to see how this plays out for the fireworks folks.   JK I'm not interested. I'm laughing, too. I hope it all shuts down.",godzillachilla,2025-05-01T09:08:30,14
"I dunno, China has been making fireworks for 2200 years‚Ä¶pretty sure they mastered the science behind producing cheap and efficient fireworks for the world to enjoy. Just to mo bad the US doesn‚Äôt want to be a part of the world anymore.",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-01T10:27:53,5
"It‚Äôs also really expensive to manufacture explosives safely, not so much of a problem in China.",Virtual_Plantain_707,2025-05-01T11:21:55,2
There's a certain irony that the party that never shuts up about patriotism is the reason that the one day actually devoted to that patriotism takes a hit.,BeltOk7189,2025-05-01T09:16:08,8
