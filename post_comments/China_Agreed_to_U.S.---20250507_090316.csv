The US can’t play hardball because hardballs are manufactured in China.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-07T09:10:14,16
Good. The only way we’re going to learn as a county is to feel the pain. It’s going to be a very hard lesson.,BigAddam,2025-05-07T09:10:43,3

"Republicans believe that all of the Chinese factory workers are now unemployed and thus will get on their knees and give America whatever it wants. Even Bessent said the tariffs would likely see 5-10 million unemployed in China which would be pretty rough if it happened in the US, but in China with a workforce of nearly 800 million, it would barely be a blip on the radar. Republicans also don't understand that the rules for both sides are different and thus negotiations will reflect that reality. One side is run by a dictator that can inflict as much pain on the people as necessary for as long as necessary with little risk of losing power, while the other side will be out of power potentially as soon as 20 months from now. China operates on a time scale of 100 years while the US president doesn't have a plan for the next 100 hours.",mkt853,2025-05-07T09:48:58,7
