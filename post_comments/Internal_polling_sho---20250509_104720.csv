"Proud Democrat living in the hills south of Pittsburgh (MAGA country), and I can confirm that I have lost all faith in John Fetterman. So sad.",Is_Doom_Imminent,2025-05-09T10:50:49,14
"> Forty-nine percent (of Pittsburgh Democrats) said they have an unfavorable impression of him, while 46 percent said they have a favorable impression, according to the survey.  There's going to need to be more of a gulf than this for primary voters to have a chance of ousting him, especially if multiple non-Fetterman candidates run in the primary. Granted, this poll was run *before* the New Yorker article, so there still be movement coming.",hunter15991,2025-05-09T11:43:14,4
">Some Democratic strategists in Pennsylvania have said that Fetterman’s shifting approach to Trump could weaken the senator among Democratic voters more than his hardline stance on Israel. Fetterman has voted to confirm a number of Trump’s top officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi. He said in January that he was meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago because he “will meet with and have a conversation with anyone if it helps me deliver for Pennsylvania and the nation.”",BabyYodaX,2025-05-09T10:48:04,2

"how long is six years?  he'll probably have dropped dead by then, so what does he care?",justaheatattack,2025-05-09T11:05:39,1
"… why is he keeping Democrats in his backyard? Can they leave? If not, I get why they are losing patience with him.  Someone should really check on the guy, he seems really unhinged lately.",Kronzypantz,2025-05-09T11:04:51,1
"Fetterman was elected in 2022, so it's actually only 4 years. He's up in 2028.  At this point, I think he will certainly draw a primary challenge.",gradientz,2025-05-09T11:19:43,2
> 4 years  Technically the 2028 PA-SEN primary is 3 years from next Saturday.,hunter15991,2025-05-09T13:25:39,1
