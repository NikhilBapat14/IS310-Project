"They're repurposing it - its not for high-level political insight or information(though, was it ever? but now its more blatant). They're using it for engagement and propaganda.

Putting an edgelord in charge of White House social media is a VERY bad decision tactically as it is turning off more and more people and hurting any political alliances that could build support for policies. Trump has a razor slim majority in the House and senate and a number of Republicans are afraid to back his policies, so getting any Democratic votes will help him get his policies passed. Calling Democrats evil is not going to win over any support for any policy and makes it even harder to pass his agenda.

"What would make anyone think that this ""administration"" cares one whit about Russia in Ukraine, or peace in Gaza, or interest rates, or the economy, or inflation, or anything for that matter?  The only thing that matters to these people is ""winning"".  Now that they won, its time to show who they really are--cruel grifters who want to line their own pockets and visit as much cruelty upon the rest of us as possible--whether you voted for them or not.     Why else would DOGE be firing thousands of federal workers?  Why else would DEI initiatives become bad?  Why else would he deport these people and videotape the whole thing and set it to music?  Why else would he impose tariffs?  Why else would they poke Canada and Mexico in the eye, and abandon our allies in Europe?    What is in any of this for American people?  How does it make us great again?  It doesn't.  It was never intended to.  They don't care about making America great--they never have.     The cruelty not just the point--it is the only point.  Be as cruel as possible to everyone who is not working for you or related to you or didn't try to overthrow the government on your behalf.  And while you are at it, grift as much as possible pushing your new crypto, your hotels, clubs, social media platform and make every deal you can for yourself.

"I think there are two things that add to this issue of these big reveals about politicians not getting the traction or having the intended consequences materialize.   One is people are aware of the ""October surprise"" playbook and they've become immune or indifferent to it. They think oh big deal this is the opposition waiting for the perfect moment to release this information that they've been holding onto for God knows how long just to gain an advantage against their political opponent. They just ignore it or blow it off as a political stunt.   The second thing that adds to this attitude is that people have become very entrenched on their side of the political divide. For some people their political ideology and affiliation is their identity. They will support their candidate no matter what and will not concede anything knowing it may make their side look bad or give an advantage to the opposition.   I can remember when they released Trump saying you can grab women by the well most of Us remember what he said I'm pretty sure. I remember everyone thought this is it he's finished in politics he'll never win and his political career is over. Well it bounced off him like bullets. It's not like this is just a Trump phenomenon either. I also remember Tara Reade coming out publicly and describing how Joe Biden had cornered her and did to her pretty much what Trump had said previously. It was barely a story she was pretty much immediately dismissed as making it up for political gain. She could have been lying who knows but it was surprising how fast she was refuted and everyone moved on.

"It's both.    The cruelty is the point, but it's also a means to an end.   When anyone gets upset--left-leaning or otherwise--they make mistakes because they've switched from operating on a logical level to an emotional one.   They start ranting, break-down, lash out, and just generally make poorer decisions.  All of this provides fuel for more mockery and cruelty, because in our modern social media dystopian nightmare all of these emotional outbursts are documented and immortalized as memes and shared amongst the opposition.  This in turn enforces in-group/out-group separation.

"I understand your effort at making an analogy with the Tara Reade's accusations, but it's actually a  poor example, compared to Trump's endless parade of scandals.   The problem with Tara Reade's accusations are that she never told anybody at the time it happened. She has publicly changed her story about exactly what happened multiple times. She has been diagnosed with mental health issues. People close to her (including family) have publicly said she's not a stable or reliable person. The Republicans will drag her out from time to time, but those accusations were around for quite awhile and never really timed as an ""October Surprise"".   While I do support the idea that women giving voice to sexual assault allegations should be listened to, I think it's also important to pay attention to context, and the pathology of sexual assault. When the Cosby allegations and the Weinstein allegations became public, there was a whole lot of corroboration and voices saying things like ""Yeah, I had heard that about him"", or  ""Yeah, he did that to me."" When Reade's allegations came out, there was none of that. When E.Jean Carroll's accusations became public, something like 26 women came forward to allege sexual assault by Donald Trump, including ( in a book) one of his ex wives. Sexual assault, particularly in men who've been at it awhile, usually demonstrates a clear pattern of behavior.   I have no real interest in defending Joe Biden, what he may or may not have done, but I think the context on that allegation is worlds apart from the things Donald Trump has been accused of, and bragged about in his own words.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-29T18:34:49,10

If Biden had been credibly accused of rape, that would have been a serious problem for many of his supporters.   > She could have been lying who knows but it was surprising how fast she was refuted and everyone moved on.
