His hammering away at this angle is what convinces me that he is deliberately trying to weaken the USA and her alliances.         Starting a dumb trade war is one thing. Dumb self-defeating policy is one thing. But repeatedly threatening one of our oldest and closest ally's sovereignty is a whole other level of craziness.          In 100 days he's turned damn near every single consumer in our largest export market against us.,100cpm,2025-04-28T08:25:22,10678

"Someone told Trump that northern Canada has resources and potentially strategic routes for both trade and military. So in his natural blunt, narcissistic, and tactless way, he just came out and said that Canada should be part of the US. Why negotiate to form bilateral deals when you can just do a hostile takeover and take everything?  Him and MAGA as a whole can't comprehend a country other than their own having pride in itself, and wanting to remain independent. It's insanely ironic when you think about it, and speaks to how little they care about the rights and autonomy of people that aren't them.  What's probably the most insulting is him wanting to turn the whole country into one state. It shows how demeaning he intends this rhetoric to be when he's offering a country with more people than California and a landmass bigger than the entire mainland USA the same level of representation in the Senate and state votes as Wyoming.",TheBlueBlaze,2025-04-28T09:36:08,5

For starters, I truly believe Trump is just this dumb, dull, and belligerent to hammer away at ""winning"" Canada as the 51st state to cement some sort of narcissistic legacy up there with the Louisiana Purchase in his mind. The ***REAL*** reason for this push is Elon and other energy-tech bros wanting unfettered access to the rare earth minerals in Canada for battery production as well as the strategic collusion between Russia and Trump on the Northern Passage for shipping lanes being entirely controlled by the USA if Canada is absorbed into our union. It's so fucking transparent and obvious, but Trump thinks he's clever (and I'd go so far as to say his administration staff and Elon think they are too). The boundless incompetence and overestimated acumen and cleverness this administration demonstrates further bolsters this theory of their belief that they are master manipulators.   What is concerning is the aggression in rhetoric surround this and Greenland for instance (also part of those rare earth mineral and Northern Passage goals) that involve not excluding a military response to acquisition aka invasion. There is a very non-zero chance Trump will compel Hegseth to deploy troops to Greenland and Canada (probably at the borders and/or shoreline) and then possibly invade. How NATO will handle this is to be seen, but I'm guessing daddy Putin is pushing for this and is likely convincing Donald and others that the Ukraine invasion strategy is effective and necessary to continued survival of the USA without realizing how much Putin is playing them to undermine and effectively destroy the USA's soft power.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-04-28T10:24:02,2

I have always assumed it is a brain-dead tactic to have more strength in trade negations and/or a distraction for the press so that they focus less on how wildly incompetent/criminal his government is.  The fact that he is still doubling down on it this hard is... wild. And he is basically giving the conservative candidate for PM an anti-endorsement by suggesting that he is in favor of the extremely unpopular idea of Canada being demoted from a country to a state. I don't know any more. All he is accomplishing is hurting the US. How knows, maybe Putin has been whispering in his ear really convincing him that this can happen. It certainly is a positive for Russia. Damaging the US's relationship with their allies, and turning the US into a power-hungry empire desperate to expand.

"You‚Äôre absolutely right! Here‚Äôs the reason why:  How Inflation and Bankruptcy Could Benefit the 1%  1. Asset Ownership and Price Appreciation  The wealthiest 1% hold most of their net worth in assets ‚Äî stocks, real estate, businesses, commodities, rare collectibles, etc. When inflation rises: 	‚Ä¢	Asset prices usually inflate too (especially real estate, commodities, equities). 	‚Ä¢	Since their assets appreciate faster than the rate of inflation, the 1% actually get wealthier in nominal terms, even while the broader population suffers from higher living costs.  Example: 	‚Ä¢	Home prices double, food prices double ‚Äî but if you own 100 homes, you just doubled your wealth, not your food bills.  ‚∏ª  2. Access to Cheap, Leveraged Debt  The ultra-wealthy often borrow large sums against their assets at very low interest rates. 	‚Ä¢	Inflation erodes the real value of debt. If you borrowed $10 million, and inflation skyrockets, paying back that debt becomes ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù in real terms. 	‚Ä¢	Banks may become reluctant to lend to average people during a collapse, but the 1% ‚Äî who already have collateral ‚Äî still get access to credit and can buy distressed assets cheaply.  ‚∏ª  3. Mass Liquidation of Middle-Class Assets  If millions go bankrupt: 	‚Ä¢	Their homes, cars, businesses, and investments are liquidated at fire-sale prices. 	‚Ä¢	The 1% can swoop in and buy these assets extremely cheap, consolidating even more ownership over housing, land, and productive assets.  This happened during: 	‚Ä¢	The Great Depression (big banks and wealthy individuals bought up massive tracts of land). 	‚Ä¢	The 2008 Financial Crisis (Wall Street firms bought up foreclosed homes en masse).  ‚∏ª  4. Political Influence and Policy Capture  When economic distress worsens: 	‚Ä¢	Those with money wield even more political power (through lobbying, campaign donations, think tanks, media ownership). 	‚Ä¢	They can push for bailouts, tax breaks, favorable policies that help them grow their wealth even more ‚Äî often at the cost of the broader public.  In other words: The worse the economy gets for the majority, the easier it is for the minority with power to shape the rules in their favor.  ‚∏ª  5. Shift to Renting and Subscription Economies  If fewer people can afford homes or ownership: 	‚Ä¢	Renting becomes the default. 	‚Ä¢	Corporations (owned by the 1%) own more of what people need: housing, transportation (ride-sharing), even basic needs (food subscriptions, healthcare services). 	‚Ä¢	Permanent dependency on the systems controlled by the wealthy increases.  This is sometimes summarized by phrases like:  ‚ÄúYou will own nothing and be happy‚Äù (which originated from a WEF report, but has been misinterpreted and politicized ‚Äî still, it hints at the trend toward corporate ownership over individual ownership).",Solidarios,2025-04-28T14:59:52,1

So i think they may stick with PP for a while since he got them above 39% for the first time since 2011 and second time since 1988 and thats usually enough to win. Its just that the liberals seized the moment better, have a candidate with basically a perfect resume for this situation, and the NDP and Bloc Qu√©b√©cois (not nearly as much as the NDP) collapsed and went liberal. I mean liberals are polling are 42.8%, thanks to the collapse of the NDP and Bloc, which is the largest popular vote share since 1998.

I think he primarily flies by the seat of his pants, with said seat being either his own terrible impulses, or whatever was most recently said to him by one of his sycophantic psychopathic advisors.  But a small part of me worries that he *wants* a big Carney victory because it increases the likelihood of disunity between Alberta (and maybe Sask) and the rest of Canada. Disunity he can use to his advantage. He, or an advisor, might think they can interfere and encourage a referendum on independence, followed by welcoming a couple new Red States - ones with a bunch of oil, uranium, timber, and potash - into the Union.  He then gets to expand the US, secure access to resources, and not have to deal with occupation, war, or new blue states.  I still want Carney to win, but I hope he gets to work on an East West pipeline and tackling internal trade barriers. Both because it's actually good policy (western conservatives are stopped clocks getting it right for once on these issues), and because it'd help reduce anti-East sentiment here in Alberta.

"while the focus this election has almost entirely been on the Liberals and Conservatives, its quite interesting to look at just how badly the NDP screwed themselves.   Before the whole \*everything* when the Cons were projected to get a major majority and the Liberals not even retaining party status, the NDP stood to gain, likely becoming the official opposition.   But once the tide started to turn, they went on the offensive against the Liberals, which was stupid for two main reasons: people were not appreciative of the attacks when we should be united against the larger threat; and the attacks ring hollow due to how long the NDP propped up the ""Trudeau regime"" with their supply and confidence agreement.   Had they pulled confidence earlier and forced a vote? then yeah, the attacks would've at least been a bit more understandable. As it is, the NDP has lost its identity as a workers party and people are voting strategically to keep conservatives out, which in most cases means voting Liberal, so I wont be surprised if you can count the NDP seats on one hand.",AugmentedDragon,2025-04-28T11:37:56,1

After all the history I've learned about I'm half convinced we have a small military just so we don't make other countries nervous. We invented night time raids in WW1 and the Geneva Convention was written because we got up to such a heinous level of shenanigans that after WW1 everyone collectively got together to decide that our bullshit wasn't allowed anymore. We jokingly call it the Geneva Checklist.   It's mostly a joke anyways.,Aisling_The_Sapphire,2025-04-28T17:30:34,1

"So Canadian politics and voting patterns mean it is actually likely for Poilievre and the Conservatives to get a plurality of the popular vote and the Liberals to still get a majority of seats in Parliament. The Liberal vote is very efficient. They get strong turnout in mostly competitive ridings. The Conservatives tend to either win their ridings by a ton, or get a low turnout. (while the effect is similar, Canadian ridings are not gerrymandered either, they are set by an independent commission, just the Conservatives have locked up a lot of the rural vote, and the urban vote tends to be split between the three parties).  Last election the Conservatives won the popular vote but were a distant second in seats.

Like not only do you see hotels/restaurants and stuff around the beaches/amusement parks take a hit but because of that hit you have less money flowing through the people that live there which then effects the not tourist industries.  2)The tariffs will cause an increase in necessary goods. Windows 10/11 is going to hit an EOL point because of TPM Chips being outdated in many models. A lot of folks will be looking for new computers. The costs will rise.

I‚Äôm very much going about my life actively changing my life and choosing my words more carefully rather than being mad when they don‚Äôt.  They don‚Äôt care about the meaning of words or perspective like I do, but it can affect most of us similarly. I say that, as in, I ascribe different meanings to words, and I know enough about language to know that and think actively about the tone/implications. But they influence us all anyways. Depending on whether you are in a state where you are willing to hear and accept new information with an open mind.   Takes time to build that kind of trust, and feeling safe. Especially with so many examples in your face of what you do have to fear. American media is really good at only providing a small sliver of hope or good happening in the world. It‚Äôs often‚Ä¶ crime and punishment and celebration of both lol. Here‚Äôs hoping to a better future for us all in the end.",Jayde_,2025-04-28T17:59:14,1

I wish Dems would actually make an effort here. In 2017 Bernie did a town hall at my old high school and had huge turnout. That‚Äôs in a county that swings like 90+% to Trump.

There was zero planning, zero self-awareness, zero consideration during the Biden presidency. It should have been all hands on deck strategizing for 2024. Instead,I feel like they were just constantly caught unawares and doing very poor damage control.
