We all know that the Earth was much hotter when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. We also know that there have been multiple ice ages. And we know that we're currently on the way out of an ice age.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-26T21:17:27,16
I learned this one back in my 70's Science Class. How is this study any different from the facts I grew up with?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T08:12:55,3
It’s not new. This has been known for years and years.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-26T22:28:24,7
"There's been multiple global extinction events before humans were even on the scene, including climate change  [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_extinction\_events](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extinction_events)  By all means, support things that are good for the environment, but have the right perspective.",Briguy28,2025-04-26T21:18:47,12
"I finished reading Michael Crichton's book State of Fear, recently.  He has a VERY good stance on this subject. He blames environmentalist movements just as much as anyone else for causing harmful environmental effects. Not for climate change, but for causing so much damage and harm to regional environments and people BECAUSE of their actions. A prime example is California and its failure to properly manage the environments that compose the state, causing things like frequent wildfires, all because some environmentalists who don't know what they're talking about and ignore the ACTUAL science behind environmental management actually entails, screamed the loudest and made political donations and money the primary motivator.  Environmentalist movements cause increased poverty, death, disease, environmental harm, and violence BECAUSE they have politicized science for their own uses. This has caused a leap in scientists, who have nothing to lose, post-retirement, to begin to reject their viewpoints and oppose them. It's also caused a leap in attempts at totalitarian mandates to the world, which is EXACTLY what Crichton warns against when politicizing science like this.  Gore, Thunberg, Green Peace, all of them are pushing for something they know nothing about, and what they push has caused almost irreparable harm in the name of ""protecting the planet"".",ITrCool,2025-04-26T21:26:17,1
We have known this for a long time. It's all a ruse to bash big oil. For Europe especially it evens the playing field to make the US have less natural energy to use.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T01:11:24,1
"The old studies showed that too, but they were ignored, so communism could be pushed on people in the name of climate change.",Rapidfiremma,2025-04-26T21:13:27,1
What I been sayin all along..   We're coming out of the lil Ice Age.,ApricotNo2918,2025-04-26T21:50:54,-1

"Yeah, and you see some of these billionaires pushing ideas like giant space mirrors or airborne microrganisms that eat CO2.  Most of those ideas are terrifying, and have WAY more potential to destroy life on Earth than anything we've ever done. The best hope is that they actually would break on their own and do nothing.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-26T22:18:26,1
