"From the article:  Democrats dismissed the legislation as a pandering and performative waste of time when Republicans were struggling to reach agreement on legislation to fulfill the president’s domestic policy agenda — the “big, beautiful bill” that could include unpopular cuts to Medicaid.  Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the minority leader, called it a “silly, small-minded and sycophantic piece of legislation.” He said the only silver lining of the exercise was that it underscored how Republicans were laboring to enact that domestic policy measure, which he warned would impose the largest Medicaid cut in history.  “It’s easy to mock this legislation because it’s so inane and embarrassing,” Representative Mary Gay Scanlon, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said during debate on the measure this week. “This may be the dumbest bill brought to the floor during the six years I’ve served in this Congress.”  Ms. Scanlon and other Democrats noted that recent polls, including one conducted by Fox News, showed that almost 70 percent of voters opposed Mr. Trump’s executive action to rename the Gulf, making it one of the least popular actions of his busy first 100 days.",LurkerFromTheVoid,2025-05-08T14:17:44,10

There's a lot of high brow ways to describe the Gulf of Mexico drama but really the only one that really hits the mark. It's just dumb shit for the rubes to gloat about at work.,Wolfrattle,2025-05-08T14:25:12,5

"""...Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who sponsored the bill, calling it “one of the most important things we can do this Congress.”""    One of the most important things of the Congress is renaming a body of water???

Next they'll start denying visas and/or deporting people who still refer to it as the Gulf of Mexico. I know their game.,RealGianath,2025-05-08T14:27:37,1
"Should never been named Gulf of Mexico to begin with. WE are America, part of North America, not Mexico, and we have the largest land border with The gulf, even more than Mexico, so should be gulf of America, if you are don't want the name change, leave the country and go to Mexico.",Roger_Rabbit6969,2025-05-08T20:50:40,1

"""Ms. Scanlon and other Democrats noted that recent polls, including one conducted by Fox News, showed that almost 70 percent of voters opposed Mr. Trump’s executive action to rename the Gulf, making it one of the least popular actions of his busy first 100 days.""  First... Trump is now the president. He told EVERYONE ""You only need to vote for me this time"". That was a shot across the bow that once elected he had NO PLANS of representing ANYONE but himself.   Second... 90 million did NOT vote. That mean that the""70% of voters"" that oppose it are less than 50% of the eligible voting population. Which means..? Apathy allowed that name change.",williamgman,2025-05-08T14:26:18,1
