seems like both sides tbh. almost like anger is manufactured to keep people fighting or something ü´¢,BasedSquareBase,2025-04-29T15:51:21,1
One side is angry about made up things just to be angry. The other side is angry because their lives are being torched by a psychotic dictator put into power by the people making shit up to scare the stupid.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-29T15:54:38,3
you‚Äôre so close. both sides say this about the other side,BasedSquareBase,2025-04-30T14:00:37,1
"One is actual reality and the other is made up bs. In the real world trump is defying the courts, shredding the constitution and demolishing our economy by his lone actions.   Meanwhile over on the right wing side they are screaming about how its bidens fault for something that happened after he left. They blame democrats despite Republicans having all the power right now. Despite the tariffs being solely on trump. They believe garbage like how the left wants people to be trans species and has litter boxes in elementary schools for cat people.   Or how about the pizzeria that housed a pedo smuggling ring despite not actually having a basement and it being debunked years ago? How about the blm protests when fox news constantly used images from riots in Spain claiming it was Oregon?   One side has science, the other has con men. This is not a both sides thing",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-30T14:20:28,1
Your whole argument falls apart as soon as you try to explain who ‚Äúthey‚Äù is.  ‚ÄúMeanwhile over on the left side they‚Äôre forcing kids to learn about drag shows and question their gender. They blame Trump for everything that‚Äôs wrong with this country despite having a president who aligns with their values for 4 years and not doing anything about anything‚Ä¶‚Äù  Are you saying every right winger believes those things? Or every left winger thinks kids should be allowed to change their gender with surgery?,BasedSquareBase,2025-04-30T14:46:26,1
"It doesn't fall apart because they are the right wing apparatus that has built an entire propaganda network to control the gullible rubes who would rather blame everything on a boogeyman than address the real problems of the world.

"So the sides are one group of people wants to rule the country in a dictatorship with a psychotic madman. The other side is a group of people that don't want this country to be a dictatorship.

You should check out r/latestagecapitalism. I think you‚Äôll understand my point of view that it‚Äôs all theater to keep Americans angry. And I strongly believe that everyone needs to be a little silly sometimes  https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/s/A1GSdz0wYe,BasedSquareBase,2025-05-01T00:06:26,1
You can't seriously be asking that. They are literally getting plans together to establish martial law and establish a police state that will arrest any one against trump. He signed the executive order assigning the planning stage to the doj and pentagon Monday.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-01T00:37:50,1
I understand the ploy and methods of late stage capitalism. However they established an autocratic dictatorship which is determined to crush anyone against trump. The rich made a stupid move to try and get more power and tax cuts by trying to use maga and trumpism to push their agenda. Now the monster is loose and they are running out of options to deal with him.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-01T00:41:11,1
Every week it‚Äôs something. He‚Äôs trying to be a dictator or he‚Äôs calling martial law or he‚Äôs tanking the economy on purpose. When biden was president it was the same thing. Referring back to my original point; it‚Äôs almost like anger is manufactured to keep people fighting over nothing.   I‚Äôm not sure how else to convince you but I hope I can change your mind about there only being 2 groups in politics. I have to admit I took a quick look at your profile and saw you also browse mtf subreddits. Have you seen r/truscum?,BasedSquareBase,2025-05-01T00:47:48,1
