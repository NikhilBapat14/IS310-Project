"I feel like this is probably right. People who rode the wave or got sucked into the attention he was getting and are now seeing his plans actually happen.

"There‚Äôs a lot of people here talking about the stupidity of these voters, but I‚Äôd like to highlight the systemic issues as well. The massive distrust that‚Äôs been sown on the Right and the Left (but don‚Äôt kid yourself, it‚Äôs mostly on the Right) of legacy media who have the resources to actually get to the truth of a situation is not good because now there are people who‚Äôs knee-jerk mental reaction to hearing X from the mainstream media is to believe ‚Äúnot X‚Äù.  And that‚Äôs if people even have time or energy to watch the news and parse it. The reality is that a ton of working families and single parents just have no time or energy to do this. This is one of the reasons that young people get so much of their ‚Äúnews‚Äù from TikTok. Yes there are psychological reasons and free-choice reasons as well, but we shouldn‚Äôt discount the systemic issues because the systemic issues are the ones that will snowball into inevitability.",cvanhim,2025-04-30T09:46:48,21

"By Martha McHardy - US News Reporter:   One in four Donald Trump voters regret voting for him or are disappointed by his early performance back as president, a new poll suggests.  Navigator Research's poll, conducted April 24 to 28 among 1,000 registered voters, found about 1 in 9 (11 percent) of respondents who voted for Trump in 2024 regretted having done so, another 16 percent do not regret voting for him but were disappointed.

It‚Äôs 24/7 manipulation of the narrative, all day, every day, everywhere. They keep playing this channel at gyms, airports, restaurant/bars, in grandpa‚Äôs house. The stock market could have its biggest drop since the depression, and the ticker goes off the screen and they talk about the revelation that Biden pooped his underwear in 2022 and Kamala and Pelosi deliberately hid this bombshell.  ¬†Nobody but the Atlantic and Rolling Stone care that he promised $1 eggs and ending the Ukraine war in 24hrs while NOT delivering. NYT and AP are doing a valiant job, yet clearly under a lot of pressure to not get sued to smithereens and also just thinking of navigating the biggest stories of the day as opposed to focusing on hit pieces.  Which TBF, hit pieces are more the style of shock entertainment news, not normal news. And that‚Äôs where this conundrum comes; do NYT and AP become tabloids where they keep hammering 2-3 nonsensical stories endlessly ad-naseum for a low IQ/less-perceptive/more-senile base to consume? Not to defend NYT, they‚Äôve slipped, but they‚Äôre still grounded in fairly respectable journalism.  Which leads to MSNBC, which is an echo chamber with little influence outside its smaller liberal audience, and CNN, which can perhaps claw back some ‚Äúundecided‚Äù, swing, moderate voters after really losing its reputation‚Ä¶ but even then, the damage has been done to its brand.  It‚Äôs gonna take major main street pain and Fox News acknowledging it for the 5-10% swing Democrats need. And honestly, the midterms need to be a landslide without funny business, IMO. If there are tight races, I see a whole lot of judicial stink calling Republican seats.¬† Meanwhile, all it takes is 2 weeks of economic stimulation and TV/Rogan time for the Cult of Personality to win back his helpless ‚Äúscared‚Äù voters. Amnesia will kick in and they‚Äôll forget about all his felonies and unconstitutional actions, and the wrecking ball he threw on America‚Äôs strong leading global economy and strategic position of influence with allies. It‚Äôs still quite amazing the Republicans won 2024, given the prior 8 years. You have to hand it to people; bad memories, bad listening skills, bad foresight.

I was still in contemplation. On second thought, ""What could he do for us""? There are two examples that, I would consider sincere as an American. How does America get out of debt. It really looks bad, and who is going to be a president who's good with money? I would believe that every question an American poses is founded on this point of view. I believed in him.

"We can come out of this a better country.  Maybe not better off -  too much damage has already been done -  but better.   However, this  will require people to take their vote more seriously.     Reflect on why you were fooled, as I have *never* been pleasantly surprised by someone i voted against once they were in office, nor have I been disappointed or caught off guard by the actions of someone I voted for once they were in office.  In general,   Chances are, they weren't some crafty jester like Iago.   The signs were probably there, and you missed them or deliberately ignored them.   Were you inattentive?   Were your ""trusted"" media sources weaving lies?   Did you just want to try something different because you were dissatisfied with the way things were, but didn't feel you ""had the time"" to figure out why?  Most importantly, people in this country need to learn that correlation is not causation.  If you are unhappy, why is that?   And what actually ARE the causes of those problems?  And what ARE the specific individuals proposing?   Too many times, I see people just be contrarian to incumbents when they're unhappy, and pro-incumbent when they are.   Or worse, they extrapolate this relationship to an entire political party, or to a different branch of the government altogether.   (Not happy with the way things are?   President is Democrat?   Congress is republican?    Only congressional races are on the ballot?   Vote Republican!)   That is completely irrational and irresponsible behavior as a citizen.  Be better for yourselves.  Be better for your community.   Be better for your country.    Treat it with the care you would serving on a jury, or holding a baby.  Don't just punish a party for two years, watch them march off the deep end, and then grant them another turn.   Demand they improve   I've seen this country repeat the same mistakes so many times.

"At least more and more of his supporters are realizing how horribly he is handling the economy.  It is their fault for supporting him, but then again Trump tried to blame the high interest rates on Biden than the real fact that it was Trump's handling of Covid, that left no choice but for Biden to increase interest rates.  Even with the high interest rates, during Biden's term, EUR/USD went bellow $1 = ‚Ç¨1 (US dollar being more valuable than Euro), for the first time since 1999-2000.  Trump on the other hand made EUR/USD currently becoming $1.15 = ‚Ç¨1.  Not only has Trump screwed up the economy and trade, but also he screwed up our currency.

The Republican Party and right wing media has exacerbated, and in some cases created, the worst aspects of the human condition - fear, hatred, greed, lust, tribalism, racism - and this is what they ran on, and won on.  We wouldn't allow bin Laden to come into America and set up the al-Qaeda Network and begin broadcasting demands for the murder of all Jews and Americans.  Can we all agree that would be ridiculous?    Can we also agree that at the end of World War II when the allies and Russia invaded and divided up Germany that they rightfully then censored Nazi speech to prevent Nazis from continuing to advocate for the murder of Jews and the continuation of World War II as a guerilla action?
