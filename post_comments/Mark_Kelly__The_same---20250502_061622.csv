When childrens' mental health suffers.....the GOP wins!  **Cruel is the rule.**,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-02T06:28:55,10
"Article:  >**Education Department stops $1 billion in funding for school mental health**  >The Trump administration says it will stop paying out $1 billion in federal grants that school districts across the country have been using to hire mental health professionals, including counselors and social workers.  >...  >The grants were part of the [2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2938/text) â€” a bill passed in the aftermath of the [school shooting in Uvalde, Texas](https://www.npr.org/2023/05/24/1177729989/a-year-after-uvaldes-school-massacre-healing-remains-elusive), in which a teen gunman killed 19 elementary school students and two adults and injured 17 people. The bill, among other things, poured federal dollars into schools to address rising concerns about a student mental health crisis.  >* https://www.npr.org/2025/05/01/nx-s1-5382582/trump-school-mental-health",progress18,2025-05-02T06:18:57,5
"It's so easy to trash government to win votes, but we lose track of how many little things the government does to make our lives better.  Supporting student mental health isn't a giant line item on the budget, but is a perfect example of how spending a little bit of money early on can save the government substantial money down the road.  High school graduates make about $400k more than dropouts, pay more in taxes, and have a far better chance of becoming contributing, happy members of society.  Thus helping to fulfill our Constitutional obligation to extend equality of opportunity to all Americans.",Blake_Ashby,2025-05-02T10:56:56,3
