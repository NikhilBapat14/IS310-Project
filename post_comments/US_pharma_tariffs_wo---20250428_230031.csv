"Yes, because health care in the US is already so affordable.  It's run by AI systems like those CEO Brian Thompson chose to incorporate at UnitedHealthcare, which denied humans the right to lifesaving care based on data instead of empathy.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T23:14:39,54
"(excerpts from article)   LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - A 25% U.S. tariff on pharmaceutical imports would increase U.S. drug costs by nearly $51 billion annually, boosting U.S. prices by as much as 12.9% if passed on, a report commissioned by the industry's U.S. trade group and reviewed by Reuters shows.  The analysis, conducted by Ernst & Young, found the United States imported $203 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2023, with 73% coming from Europe -- primarily Ireland, Germany and Switzerland. Total U.S. sales of finished pharmaceuticals that year were $393 billion.  The report, dated April 22 and not made public, was commissioned by the main U.S. pharmaceutical lobby, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, whose members include Amgen (AMGN.O), Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly (LLY.N), and Pfizer (PFE.N), among others.  ... Tariffs on imported finished products could be passed through to consumers by the wholesale or retail distributors paying the tariff.  But if duties were fully passed on through higher prices on domestic sales, EY estimates U.S. drug prices could rise up to 12.9%  © 2025 Reuters.

Besides, he promised better cheaper healthcare for all day one. Oh wait, that was nine years ago. Did he make good on that promise already?

"Trump backs out of most tariff's largely by himself. It's just a game to him.  Unless the American public feels the pain of Trump's tariff for a while, I don't see how anyone will change their mind.   If he continues to talk about tariff's and people are told of doom's day, but the doom's day never comes they will think Trump is right.  So yes let it go through and he'll reverse it in 24 hours, and people will realize the mess they elected..",Randomengineer84,2025-04-29T00:57:57,1

"True, but 90% of US prescriptions are filled with generic drugs, which are only responsible for 13% of drug spending. But because there are many generic drug manufacturers, and relatively few customers (Pharmacy Benefit Managers and drug wholesalers), the situation is a reverse oligopoly in which a small number of purchasers can dictate prices and terms to manufacturers.  As one real-life example, I know of manufacturers who had supply contracts with one or more wholesalers at a certain price per unit, who were forced to retroactively reduce the price of drugs *they had already sold* to the wholesalers and was in their inventory, to match a new competitor's lower bid.  Another disastrous result, under the Inflation Reduction Act (Biden presidency), manufacturers can be forced to rebate additional amounts to Medicare if the manufacturers raise prices more than the rate of inflation. So if generic manufacturers try to raise prices to account for the tariffs, they might be forced to pay additional rebates for products purchase for Medicare. As a result, it is likely that manufacturers will stop making the lowest-profit drugs in their portfolios, leading to drug shortages.  Are we Great Again yet?",Nerd-19958,2025-04-29T17:24:06,1
"The issue that is rarely, if ever, mentioned is that the World Trade Organization's Pharma Agreement essentially prohibits tariffs on pharmaceuticals and active ingredients due to essential public health priorities.  According to WTO's web page, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Macao (China), Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States currently participate in this Agreement. Sadly, Trump has zero respect for signed agreements or any other commitments.

"Yes, and while doing it, transfer as much money and property from working class people to his rich oligarch owners. Robin Hood in reverse.  Another prediction (already partially true):   After Trump's excessive import sales taxes fail to bring manufacturing to the US -- which, BTW, as a nation we had evolved away from, and was considered progress -- he and his goons will next attack labor unions and workers' ""excessive"" salaries as the cause of US industry's inability to compete in the world market. Unless Trump and the Republicans are trounced in the 2026 midterms, I predict this will be their next battle in the war on the working classes.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-29T17:15:17,1
