"""Mr. Director, What do you think the fifth Amendment means?""  ""I plead the fifth.""",thieh,2025-05-08T13:08:36,446
">FBI Director Kash Patel seems to be interpreting the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution how he sees fit, contradicting legal precedent.   >At a Senate hearing Thursday, Patel was asked by Senator Jeff Merkley if people deported under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 had the constitutional right to due process, which the Trump administration claims is not the case.   >“Are you gonna launch an investigation of the reported violation of the due process of several hundred individuals?” Merkley asked Patel.

"It’s a good thing because his refusal to offer legal opinions on constitutional questions during a Senate hearing is a strong example of institutional discipline and respect for the rule of law. By deferring judgment on due process rights under the Alien Enemies Act, he is affirming that the FBI’s role is not to legislate or interpret the Constitution, but to enforce the law as written and adjudicated by courts. And it’s thecorrect decision because it preserves the separation of powers… When law enforcement agencies like the FBI begin making legal or constitutional judgments outside their authority, it opens the door to politicization and erosion of public trust. Patel’s approach helps ensure the FBI remains an impartial body, focused on investigations and not politics or ideological agendas. He is maintaining neutrality.

Couple that with the destruction to critical thinking social media influencers have done to people and we are here. Morals and values are all but completely gone from our society. Expecting some sort of set of higher moral values to suddenly come over anyone on the right is a fools errand at this point.

"Try again………..  Since we are common law let’s interpret it like this - The  14th Amendment was never intended to extend full constitutional protections to those who entered the country illegally. The “jurisdiction” clause of the 14th Amendment—“subject to the jurisdiction thereof”—means individuals must owe allegiance to the U.S., which illegal entrants do not, and thus aren’t entitled to constitutional protections like citizens or legal residents.  Under the plenary power doctrine, congress and the executive branch both have broad authority over immigration and border control. Courts have long acknowledged that immigration is a special legal context where the government may exercise powers—including detention and deportation—without granting the full scope of due process. This includes denying certain procedural rights to illegal entrants, especially at the border or in expedited removal proceedings.  One thing you people refuse to distinguish is between people who are already here present as citizens, people who enter illegally and illegally entered peoples. Courts have sometimes held that people who have entered illegally and have not been formally admitted may be treated as if they are standing outside the legal borders of the country, even while inside it. Therefore, they are not entitled to full constitutional protections, including full due process.

"To me, that's a cynical take. People change. *BUT* our opportunities for change have shrunk, mostly IMO due to phone addiction and personalized algorithmic media experiences. They're built to show us what we want, instead of challenging our worldview. People get their news from worse and worse sources. They are entertained by flatter and dumber stories.  So what remains? Personal conversations with friends and family? Sure, but because the internet has unhinged so many people, it's more likely than ever that friends or family just stop talking to you, at least about anything of substance. J.D. Vance had a famous falling out with a trans friend of his.  And finally there's personal experiences, hence the leopards ate my face meme. Dick Cheney was famously anti-gay until his daughter Mary came out as gay. Even then, Liz Cheney remained (at least publicly) anti-gay until 2021. But it's really unlikely for people have a personal experience like that.  People do change, it's just getting rarer. But if something can *become rare* it can also *become more common*.

"> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, **and subject to the jurisdiction thereof**, are **citizens** of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any **person** of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to **any person within its jurisdiction** the equal protection of the laws.  Subject to the jurisdiction of means a subject to the law of, which is to say that if you commit a crime in or against the United States and can thus be charged by a US court, you are entitled to due process.   If it was implicit that only citizens are subjects to the jurisdiction of the United States (In which case, the US wouldn't be able to charge any non-citizen with a crime?), they would have written ""are"" instead of ""and"".  The use of both Citizen and Person is also deliberate to make it clear that ANYONE charged is entitled to this and not just citizens.   Because those are two different words, you see? If they meant citizen only they would have written citizen.   If you want an example of person not specifically being equated to citizen, look at the requirements for being a representative or senator.   > No **Person** shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years **a Citizen of the United States**, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.  Oh, is that recognizing personhood as a quality separate from citizenship? I do believe it is.
