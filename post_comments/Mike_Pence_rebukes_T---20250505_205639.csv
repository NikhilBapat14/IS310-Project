Trump is a Russian asset. Was Pence really *so* in the dark to not realize this during his term as VP?,BukkitCrab,2025-05-05T21:11:46,15
Trump never had any support for Ukraine.   He's been a Russian asset since the 1980's.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-05T21:02:11,8
But he has full confidence in Pam Bondi and Tom Holman.,veridique,2025-05-05T21:12:58,5
">Pence said: “If the last three years teaches us anything, it’s that Vladimir Putin doesn’t want peace; he wants [Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine). And the fact that we are now nearly two months of following a ceasefire agreement that Ukraine has agreed to and Russia continues to delay and give excuses confirms that point.  >“The wavering support the administration has shown over the last few months, I believe, has only emboldened [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia).”  This part! 👏👏👏 I really appreciate Pence and anyone else who's willing to speak so clearly about Ukraine and russia. I'm tired of trump and others who take a neutral/both sides/compromise approach (which really favors russia). russia is the aggressor and does not want peace. This isn't hard to understand.",sachiprecious,2025-05-05T21:03:32,9
Cause he’s tryna set up a 2028 presidential run. The muthafucka has no soul,Dassman88,2025-05-06T01:41:32,3
Good on Pence for growing a spine.   Trump’s right hand man turning on him is very telling of how clueless the maga chuds are,alex_song,2025-05-05T21:25:01,3
"Ugghhh! If had a dollar for every fucking time Pence has said how proud he is of the 4 years he served with that corrupt, mother fucking piece of shit …..   And of course they never had a cross word. Pence was always too busy licking the orange, man-child’s tiny nutsack.   As for 1/6, Pence did what he was REQUIRED to do by the Constitution. I’m not ever doing any cartwheels to celebrate him for doing his fucking job.",bbjenn,2025-05-05T21:25:25,2
Pence is a coward. He is weak. He does not have the balls to really stand up to Trump. He said he would not endorse him in 2024... But would not rule out voting for him... His words are meaningless.,SAJ-13,2025-05-05T23:53:39,3
Pence’s only redeeming quality is that occasionally he stands up to Trump.,Yourmama18,2025-05-06T04:55:53,1
"Trying to appeal to the ""hang Mike Pence"" crowd",30mil,2025-05-06T07:43:20,1
If that whole pesky Jan 6 thing didn’t happen Pence would still be slavishly supporting anything Trump does. He definitely debated doing Trump’s dirty work on the election certification. His fear of getting legally in trouble for it later is what made him not go through with it (in my opinion).,Viral_Poster,2025-05-05T21:46:19,9
