"For those who support this administration, ask yourself, why is Trump fighting so hard to not have to afford people rights? Why is he so against ensuring the people he's throwing into prison camps having any legal rights to challenge their detention?   And then ask yourself, what would you do if the federal government arrested you and accused you of being an illegal immigrant or a terrorist? How would you challenge your detention if the administration can deny those rights by simply making that accusation?",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T18:11:05,117

"Just another step that the Trump administration is taking towards full blown authoritarianism.  The only thing that Trump has done since ""day one"" is flout the law.  He has literally set a record for executive orders signed and a vast amount of them have been challenged by the courts.  He continues to live up to the criticism that he is a dictator; sidestepping congress; ignoring checks and balances; threatening anyone who presents an obstacle to his administration's agenda, and all while he plays coy in the face of scrutiny from critics, judges, journalists, and the media, all of whom have tried to hold him accountable for his unlawful and unconstitutional actions.  In his first 100 days, Trump has signed over 140 executive orders, setting the record by a wide margin.  FDR held the previous record with 99 EOs, Joe Biden signed 42 within his first 100 days.  This is also concerning because Republicans aren't really passing any meaningful legislation in Congress. Instead, they're passively yielding their power to Trump, allowing him to assert his unitary executive powers—as outlined in Project 2025 of course—so he can enact the party's agenda via these unconstitutional EOs.  The more that Republicans capitulate to Trump and the more that he continues to overstep or lord over congress, the more likely he is to help the party consolidate power for the foreseeable future. Meaning much better job security for Republicans.  This will also empower Trump to pressure congress to fund his mass deportation raids and migrant camps.  And Stephen Miller—the little shit weasel he is—has been enabling this all along the way,.  After Trump won the election, Miller moved himself and his family to Palm Beach to both be closer to Trump *and* his presidency.  Miller has played a sizeable role in helping craft policies like the ""zero tolerance"" policy and Trump's Muslim travel bans. He's also been involved in efforts to end the DACA program.  And now he's pushing for Trump to sign what might be his most ambitious and unconstitutional executive order yet; one that suspends Habeas Corpus, which will deny *anyone* who has been unlawfully detained—and not just migrants—the right to challenge their imprisonment.  Miller and his team are responsible for drafting several of these kinds of oppressive EOs over the years, including orders to end birthright citizenship, to institute travel bans, to separate families, to declare national emergencies that grant the Trump executive unilateral powers, to make it near impossible for some migrants to obtain access to a path to citizenship or legal status, to designate drug cartels as foreign terrorists (which wouldn't sound as severe if Miller didn't have ulterior motives), and to reinstate title 42.   Title 42 was that COVID emergency policy that allowed the Trump administration to swiftly deport or expel all types of migrants without any processing.  This policy helped Trump fudge his immigration numbers and also created a backlog of border crossings for the next administration to handle.  Trump's reliance on title 42 was pretty hypocritical considering how him and his supporters downplayed COVID constantly, yet still used it as the sole basis for the policy.  What's more, it's also been reported that a team of Trump advisors, likely including Miller, have been trying for months to identify a disease that they can use to reinstate Title 42. A move that is very similar to the kind of conspiracy theories that Trump supporters have accused Democrats of being embroiled in.  Miller has had a major influence on the Trump administration, especially when it comes to how these executive orders are being drafted and implemented.  For example, when it comes to the process of drafting an EO, the presidential administration is supposed to send them to the DOJ's office of legal counsel where an independent career lawyer reviews them to determine their legality.  But here's the slimy part. Miller has been using his own team of lawyers from outside the DOJ to examine and review the orders—and sometimes his own orders.  This is particularly corrupt because the lawyer that normally fills this role is hired to be impartial and is also deliberately sectioned off from any influences within the administration.  So Miller's job here is to eliminate all roadblocks to Trump's immigration agenda.  Miller has also accomplished this by lobbying for his equally insufferable and xenophobic allies to fill positions within the Trump administration where they will be responsible for arranging deportations to other countries.  He's also used his power and leverage with Trump to form relationships with prominent lawmakers who will see to it that Congress appropriates funding for more sweeping immigration raids, harsher national security measures, and the use of the military to conduct arrests and build massive camps to detain migrants.  He will also help see to it that Congress aids the Trump administration in its efforts to concentrate power so it can continue skirting the law while enacting draconian policies that face little to no accountability, especially when it comes to all matters of immigration.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-09T18:50:03,30

"Well only Congress can do that. He could of course just ignore that like Lincoln did, and of course judges will rule against him. And then if law enforcement is complicit they'll arrest the judges - illegally. And if the justice department is complicit - which it is - then they won't do anything about the illegal arrests.   Which different from what they're doing now? Hell they ALREADY arrested a judge.  I mean almost everything he is doing he is doing illegally. And I know the point is to clog the courts with so much nonsense that by the time they've exhausted every argument and they actually have to enforce the court order, the damage is already done. I understand most of this is an intimidation technique because they don't actually have as much power that they're acting like they do.

"Weapons were not powerful enough back then, plus after a long period of war everybody loses their appetite for fighting.   But Americans haven't suffered any consequences on their soil for the myriad wars they have fought all around the world. All of them were far away.   Same as the Russians, actually. Nuclear weapons have been a disaster not because they have been used, but because they have made some countries impervious to consequences, unable to feel in their bones what it means to have your hometown bombed, and thus unable to learn how terrible war is.   Americans have forgotten the horror of war and believe that horror could never touch them.   Sadly lessons are never passed on between generations. As soon as the generation who suffered the consequences of WW II passed away, the knowledge of that horror was lost,  and no amount of books and documentaries will instill that horror in modern day Americans.",Aggravating_Teach_27,2025-05-10T06:36:53,1

"[Here](https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/1002107670/historian-uncovers-the-racist-roots-of-the-2nd-amendment) is an interesting article on the connections between slavery and the ratification of the second amendment.

"Unfortunately its the same kind of argument as ""the police exist because they used to be slave catchers""   There is *a* connection that is blown way out of proportion to suit a narrative that falls flat with any sort of good faith research.   The gun lobby is awful for many reasons, but claiming *everything* bad is ultimately racism is a not insubstantial part of what drives moderates away from otherwise good platforms.  In short, bad things can be bad for reasons other than bigotry and xenophobia.",Celtic12,2025-05-10T00:43:23,-1

Unless we end up in a civil war I doubt there will be extended fighting for reasons similar to the ones you pointed out.      I DON'T think MAGA has enough support for all out civil war because there are conservatives out there who will drop the MAGA tomfoolery the moment joblessness, food scarcity, and military on citizen violence happens.

"The police exist because mercantilists wanted to offload the cost of security to the public.   “The first publicly funded, organized police force with officers on duty full-time was created in Boston in 1838. Boston was a large shipping commercial center, and businesses had been hiring people to protect their property and safeguard the transport of goods from the port of Boston to other places, says Potter. These merchants came up with a way to save money by transferring to the cost of maintaining a police force to citizens by arguing that it was for the “collective good.””  https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/",InnerFish227,2025-05-10T00:54:31,3

So the biggest concern here isn't that the Executive will do something that will immediately get blocked by the Supreme Court.
