"   America became a powerhouse due to its immigration, no matter how they try to deny it. From the immigrant that gets paid under the table from laboring in the fields picking produce that would otherwise go rotten to the student on visa aiding in the creation of an ip that could save millions, those who migrate here have always contributed to society. Immigration is what made America truly great again , and that will always remain true despite what  propaganda maga/trump  produces that contradicts that.",Aware-Butterfly6063,2025-04-28T14:15:17,2
