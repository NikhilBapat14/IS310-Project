It's a lot of time and effort, and the best thing about it is the way a good tomato actually tastes. Even if you can/pickle veggies you're not saving much. If you put the time you spend in the garden into a job or side hustle you'd come out way ahead.    And of course the weather needs to cooperate. One good hail storm, or an early/late freeze, a summer heat dome can wreck your garden. My first year growing brussel sprouts I was proud of my plants, they were over 3 ft tall.

"You need space, time, and most importantly, knowledge to grow a garden that will yield enough produce to make it worth the time or expense. People assume you just poke some holes in the dirt. Buy a few envelopes of seeds, toss them in a line, splash some water on it, and in a few weeks, it's a jack and the beanstalk situation.   They needed to start their garden last winter if they want any early summer yield and need to be rotating plants right now for the mid summer and fall harvest. I have a decent sized garden, and it's absolutely a labor of love. But I've also been growing this pain in the ass for 20 or so years, and I'm just now starting to ""get it,"" as far as having a really successful grow season.   I've got five racks of different plants in my garage in various states of germination all year round. You have to sprout half the shit you grow and then move it outside. But you have to acclimate it first, and that means moving certain plants outside for a few hours, day after day, until they eventually can stand the elements and will grow on their own.  Then you've got the whole grow zone thing. Montana has 300 days a year of sun. But a 3 month window without frost. Then, in the south, certain plants dont do humidity. So they aren't an option.

"Yeah. I don’t buy my cookware from places like Temu or Shein, but a pair of beater jeans and tank tops that I couldn’t even touch for that price at a yard sale? You betcha. They’re just gonna get ruined mucking a stall or staining the porch. Nickels matter.",Intelligent-Film-684,2025-05-03T22:32:59,1
"Oh, for sure. Doubtless a lot of their plastics are flimsy garbage, and I wouldn’t buy screws or bolts or anything I needed to depend on (or actual dog chews/toys, for that matter, knowing how lax they are with toxins).   Just saying Temu saved me quite a bit of cash with my fostering, and for that, I’m kinda fond of them.",Intelligent-Film-684,2025-05-03T22:28:35,1
"Those rural areas don’t exist without cities.  Who do they think is eating their livestock and crops?  In return, they get clean drinking water, paved roads, and healthcare facilities.   It’s a social contract that benefits both parties.",canadianguy77,2025-05-03T17:01:25,7
"Oh wow, just 2 weeks worth. I'm sure it's an amazing 2 weeks lol but yeah, a person would need a literal field to be able to switch from store-bought to homegrown    Communal allotments are a great idea though, we have a few around here I wouldn't mind joining ",Muggaraffin,2025-05-03T14:33:13,3
"Planting next weekend.  Too many late freezes lol.  Gonna do squash, chiles (jalapeno and hatch), tomatoes, onions of all varieties, okra for coverage since they do love hot weather.  Got some sweet raised-bed gardens set up to keep the wascally wabbits out.",thandrend,2025-05-03T14:23:26,1
Yep. They want us all to live like that but are just completely incapable and will be unwilling to themselves.,Unctuous_Robot,2025-05-03T14:14:19,3
"No worries, I had just heard a lot of that whole phrasing and looked into deeper (mostly from friends and from pre-election fear mongering people for the Canadian election). I just find it incredibly silly its actually happening from the same people that were stoking the fire.     Then you see its source (of that phrase) and realize it's absolutely nothing significant and just taken out of context.",Last-Society-323,2025-05-03T16:11:17,1
Silver lining or something.,probably_your_wife,2025-05-03T22:45:27,1
"My first batch is in the ground. I have corn, eggplant, snap beans and cucumber.  In the summer I’ll do okra summer squash and probably another batch of corn.  Last year I did an early fall planting of turnips and rutabaga and pulled them up at the end of December and it worked.  We got lucky though with a not too cold fall but that’s probably the norm at this point.",Wayward_Whines,2025-05-03T14:59:37,1
