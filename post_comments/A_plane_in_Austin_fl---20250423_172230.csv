"Doesn't matter. Musk just does what he always does and say Tesla will be controlling the world by the end of the year and his stock rallies. It's pure meme stock now, completely divorced from fundamentals. Hopefully everyone will abandon Tesla soon, if they haven't already. No one should buy a Tesla in my opinion. Not worth it now.",ComfortableAcadia252,2025-04-23T17:33:44,11

Good.   That chainsaw metaphor did him in and I’m here for it. His glee for the pain he causes others makes me want him to hurt too. The entire Trump administration has brought out the dark side in me.,Humble_Mission1775,2025-04-23T17:32:22,4

"It’s always been divorced from fundamentals. At best it’s a $35 stock. It’s never been worth a buy as they have been selling lies since the beginning. But there’s no room for ethics within the bubble of investor greed. It’s a tech company, not a car company. If it was a car company Musk would’ve been removed and replaced a long time ago.",dvnxll,2025-04-23T19:27:27,4
