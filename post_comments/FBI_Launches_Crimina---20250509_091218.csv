Fun Fact: the FBI and DOJ very rarely announce that they are investigating somebody or something.  They just do the investigation and press charges if the evidence supports it.  This is a purely political effort.,code_archeologist,2025-05-09T09:15:43,37

Wow. Unbelievable and yet believable all at the same time. They can create an investigation into (pardon the pun) trumped up charges against one of Trumps political enemies but Kash Patel won't investigate whether migrants due process rights have been violated by ICE because he's not a constitutional scholar so can't say if they even have those rights despite the SCOTUS saying they do.,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-09T09:36:43,6

"> She listed a home answer having 4 rooms on a si gle document, when on other documents, she correctly listed it as 5.  I think you've got that backwards. It's a multi-family residence that a single 2001 document says has 5 units, but various documents she's filed for mortgage and insurance purposes lists it as only 4 units. The government alleges she's been lying about it only having 4 units because it allowed her to get a more favorable loan and cheaper insurance.",Moccus,2025-05-09T10:13:37,3

"Crucially, this is rarely, if ever, done by the FBI. State Attorney Generals usually pursue mortgage fraud amid other financial crimes. Letitia James, along with Kamala Harris, won landmark cases against mortgage lenders in the wake of the foreclosure crisis.

"> Crucially, this is rarely, if ever, done by the FBI.  So why did it take 5 seconds of searching to find this if it literally never happens?  > “Mortgage fraud ruins lives, destroys families, and devastates whole communities,” Attorney General Eric Holder said this morning at a press conference to announce the results of “Operation Stolen Dreams.” Launched on March 1, 2010, the multi-agency initiative has led to a total of 485 arrests. More than 330 convictions have been obtained, and nearly $11 million has been recovered. Losses from a variety of fraud schemes are estimated to exceed $2 billion.  > Operation Stolen Dreams is the government’s largest mortgage fraud takedown to date. But FBI Director Robert S. Mueller cautioned that there is still much work to be done. **The Bureau is currently pursuing more than 3,000 mortgage fraud cases**, he said, which is almost double the number from the last fiscal year.  > https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2010/june/mortgage-fraud-sweep",Moccus,2025-05-09T09:52:36,0
"These were for organized mortgage fraud performed at scale and with intent after the 2008 mortgage crisis.  The DOJ does _not_ investigate someone writing a different number on a forms. Case in point: when Trump was convicted of fraud, it was James' department investigating him, not the DOJ.  The only people who keep doing this are Republicans who are weaponizing the DOJ.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-09T10:31:58,9
