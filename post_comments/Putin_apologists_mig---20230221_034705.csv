"*edited for formatting*  This is going to be pretty long, and I apologize. I am a PhD candidate in IR, so I have some experience in dealing with these arguments, and this subject.  Tl;dr:  Why is it more problematic for the US to attempt to have good diplomatic relations with Ukraine, but seemingly ok for Russia to invade in order to prevent that? Ukraine is a state with its own security considerations, and a legitimate actor in global politics. It is not up to Russia or the US to determine what they are and are not allowed to do, and Russia intervening militarily violates this, and about a dozen other well-established norms.  Skip down to the end for a summary of coutner-arguments if you don't care about the explanations for everything.  >i find it harder to respond specifically to the challenge that the west may be hypocritical in protecting its own sphere of influence while disregarding other powers’ spheres.  There is quite a bit of hypocrisy, and at some level it comes down to global norms. We as a population, and the international system more broadly, tend to have less issue with the US and the West doing things that Russia does because the norms were created by the US and its allies to reflect their actions. The US argues that they are trying to preserve democracy, which many populations can agree is mostly a good thing, while Russia is obviously not doing that. While at a base level they are doing the same thing, the norms the US invokes are more popular and generally supported than what Russia is doing.  Now, is there hypocrisy? Absolutely. The US has a history of overthrowing democratically elected governments (see Central America and Iran). They actively support Israel, claiming it is a democracy, depsite the UN rapporteur and various NGOs describing it as an apartheid state. However, that hypocrisy does not mean that every single thing they do is wrong. The US can be bad actors in many cases and still be right in others, they are not mutually exclusive. So to answer your question, I would say that simply acknowledging the hypocrisy is a fine thing to do. Two things can be bad at the same time - Russian imperialism and American imperialism. Placing the blame on the west directly downplays the role of Russian imperialism in this war against Ukraine.  >should we expect Russian to allow its neighbours to align with the west.  The argument that I make is that Ukraine is not a play-thing for great powers. If you take traditional IR theory approaches, this holds true in almost every case. Even realism (what Mearsheimer attempts to use) would suggest that all states are self-interested (not just great powers), and will do what is best for their own security. His argument, simply put, is that the US and the West goaded Russia into this by getting closer to Ukraine, and Russia's self-interested, security-based response was to stop it via force.   However, is Ukraine not also a state with its own security considerations? Ukraine is a democratic state that, when threatened, will do what it needs to do in order to protect its security. In this case, they are moving toward the West for security guarantees. This move West is also based in norms (democracy, liberalism, etc.) but to me it is no more complicated than Ukraine being a legitimate actor in the world and doing what it feels is necessary to protect itself. Why is Ukraine always excluded from these discussions when they are the ones being invaded? Why are Russia and the US the only states anybody talks about, when there is a third, relatively large state at play here? Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 should be all the evidence anybody needs to understand why Ukraine wants to be closer to the West.  Given that we do have globally established norms (like the norm of non-intervention, and the norms that you cannot acquire territory or alter borders by force), the case for Russia being in the wrong is clearly present.  >What is the best counter-argument to this?  For me there are a few. To summarize: 1)That is a completely hyperbolic argument. Since the end of the Cold War there are actually very few such cases of this happening (at least that we know of). It doesn't matter if we *think* the US won't tolerate it, we *know* Russia will go to extreme lengths to prevent it. These are not the same.  2) Ukraine is a sovereign state that can do what it pleases. If that means turning to the West, so be it. If Russia wants better relations with the West (which I am convinced it does not, but that's a separate issue), it is up to them to be adults and not invade a country if it gets too close to the other ""side"". Russia themselves push states away with their rhetoric and actions, and Ukraine turning to the west is a natural conclusion of this.  3) Mearsheimer purports to use realism for his analyses, and he talks about rhetoric and discourse of pro-NATO sentiments in Ukraine. But in realist conceptions of state action, discourse and rhetoric don't matter at all. So the argument that ""Ukraine saying they want to join NATO is enough to make Russia invade"" is absolute nonsense, because realists don't believe in words, just actions. And Ukraine has never had a chance of joining NATO, nor do they in a million years.  4) Mearsheimer wrote a piece called ""The False Promise of International Institutions"" and in it, decried their ability to have influence in global politics. But I guess NATO, an international institution, is the exception? Either institutions are weak and powerless, or extremely influential and powerful, but they can't be both.  5) Mearsheimer's argument is inherently hypocritical. ""It is the US' fault for bringing Ukraine into its sphere of influence!"" But I thought that great powers acted in their self-interest? So it's wrong for the US to be diplomatically friendly with Ukraine, but I guess it's fine for Russia to use an overwhelming military intervention to keep Ukraine in its sphere of influence? His argument is just so thin, and not even logically coherent.  6) My final response is rooted not as much in Mearsheimer's argument, but just in reality more broadly. Look at Putin's own writings from before the invasion - he barely talks about threats from the West or NATO. His focus is on ""the mistakes of Lenin"" in devolving power to Ukraine (or as Putin calls it, ""The Periphery""). He does not believe Ukraine is a legitimate state, and in his ""manifesto"" calls for its restoration into Russia. This is imperialism, full stop. Putin is an imperialist, and the argument that it's all America's fault completely ignores that core fact, and itself is entirely hypocritical. If it is wrong for the west to be imperialistic, it is also wrong for Russia to be. Russia is as much an actor with its own objectives and ambitions, and placing all the blame on the west is just a weak argument.  Anyways, if you made it this far, thanks! Let me know if you have any questions or want any clarification, I'm always happy (genuinely) to take a break from writing my dissertation to talk about it.",PopeOfDestiny,2023-02-22T09:49:29,20
"The real question is WHY does Ukraine want to side with the west over Russia. And therefore the question would become why would Mexico become a military ally with China?  If Russia has no blame, why do so many other countries seek protection. There is no need for an invasion, if you treat Ukraine with respect and do not expect subservient adulation.  Historically the US is not much better, but the past can not be changed. Only the present. And at present Russia is invading a foreign sovereign nation, committing war crimes, murdering civilians and destroying infrastructure. There can be no reward for this action. NONE.",ItsOnlyaFewBucks,2023-02-22T14:13:22,6
"This one is tricky, because this is essentially Putin's own viewpoint, and explains why he keeps calling the West hypocritical, an ""empire of lies"", etc. The idea that Eastern European nations have the agency to make their own decisions of who to align themselves with (after years of Russian colonialism), and the question of why anyone deserves to have a sphere of influence anyway (why legitimise imperialism?) is hard to explain to people that are so cynical about anyone's motivations in foreign policy and see the world only in terms of spheres of influence. I don't know how to best explain it, but in the world we live in now this is an outdated viewpoint.  I think the best argument is that the west did nothing to have Ukraine side with itself. No one in the west pushed Ukraine to want to join NATO or the EU, it did so itself after its own experience with Russian imperialism, much like Finland, Poland, the Baltics, etc. If the counter argument is that Ukraine's democracy is a western conspiracy against Russia then unfortunately they are too far gone and there is no point in arguing any further. I know this doesn't really respond directly to the question ""why should Russia tolerate Ukraine's western alignment"", but I guess the overall point is that Russia shouldn't see the world in that way to begin with.  Everything else is somewhat hard to argue, because people who are cynical about any country's motivations in foreign policy won't be convinced. This would be that the west doesn't see the world in terms of spheres of influence to begin with, because this is just a rationale for imperialism, and is proven by all the actions western countries have taken since WWII to avoid a return to this kind of world (someone who is cynical about this will counter argue that international laws, norms, etc. are simply an attempt by the west to impose their world order anyway). It also includes the real motivations for Putin invading Ukraine (the combination of his own security and his views of the Russian sphere of influence), as well as the idea that NATO (as an ""American sphere of influence"") didn't pose a threat to him. I'm just not sure how to argue this to someone who takes the cynical position that all foreign policy has to do with spheres of influence.",ref7187,2023-02-22T08:27:32,5
"Um...why are we accepting Mearsheimer's premise? The US ""accepted it"" when Cuba aligned closely with the USSR. Sure, we had an embargo on them for decades, and if Russia wants to cut off all trade with Ukraine because they join NATO, that's their right. But does anyone accept that the US would have the right to invade Cuba simply because they turned communist? We didn't even accept that argument during the Cold War itself.  It's not hypocritical at all. We've got an actual historical example of this exact thing occurring and the US solving it with diplomatic and policy solutions, not military ones. Hell, even when the US saw proof that Cuba got literal nukes from Russia we only *considered* invading.   There's just no actual hypocritical things to discuss. Should Putin be happy about Ukraine joining NATO? Probably not, if that happens. That's fine. But invasion is not a reasonable solution, and the West is not being hypocritical in the slightest for having that perspective.",mormagils,2023-02-22T09:53:06,8
"From the perspective of IR theory, the argument is collapsing normative theory and descriptive theory.   Realism is descriptive theory of world politics. It describes how and why countries act the way they do. The Mearsheimer-type argument is that Russia's actions are rational and predictable given the anarchistic global system. The analogy is that you would expect the United States to act the same way if it was under similar circumstances.   It does not follow from that argument, that the United States or any other power should ""let"" Russia  invade Ukraine. In fact it seems like anyone conducting a good-faith realist analysis of the situation would suggest that the Western Powers are also acting perfectly rationally in their response to the situation. Maybe such an argument could be used to show that the Western Powers, if they truly wanted to avoid an invasion, should have acted differently, but that is where Realist arguments fail.   If you set ""avoiding an invasion of Ukraine"" as a goal a realist argument can tell you how to avoid it, but Ukrainians didn't just want to avoid an invasion, they also wanted to have an independent foreign policy and they made a democratic choice to risk an invasion. You have now left the realm of descriptive IR theory and entered normative theory. Liberalism is a normative IR theory and liberals (which is really just IR speak for Kantians) would say that Ukraine has a inalienable right to democratic sovereignty, and that wars of aggression are violations of International Law. Whether or not Russia's actions were rational or predictable does not make the moral.",loselyconscious,2023-02-23T03:36:42,5
"This was a great read, thanks for engaging!  So I’m going to clarify a few points of agreement and then hopefully sharpen the contentious discussion.  I’m happy to agree mearhseimer has a very particular world view that needs a healthy dose of scepticism.  Also happy to agree russia is obviously in the wrong and what they did is abhorrent.  As someone from a small country who suffered a neighbours imperialism for a longtime im also happy to agree Eastern European nations should be able to determine their own path (and this idea of sovereignty and self determination is probably the best counter argument- this is your “Ukraine is not a plaything for great powers).  Now to contention:  - “why is Ukraine always excluded from these discussions?”  -> because it’s weak (notwithstanding it’s Remarkably brave resistance); russia is nuclear armed and can afford to ignore the legitimate sovereign decisions of smaller neighbours. This is basically as blunt and as bald as IR theory can be, as I remember it anyway. Sure let big and small states act in their rational self interest, but where those interests collide small states will lose. This isn’t a theory of morality, I think a realist would just simply describe it as reality.  Also, on the distinction between thinking and knowing- while it’s true these are different it doesn’t strike me as a particularly strong argument. A pro-Russian person could well roll their eyes with some legitimacy if we responded by saying the US hasn’t invaded a neighbour (but we can’t rule out the possibility of it doing so in the future if faced with a strategic threat on its border). To be convincing we’d need to be able to confidently rule out any possibility of intervention if say Mexico pivoted over the course of a decade or so to say China. Would the US tolerate this? I mean I’d like to imagine it would and it would abide by the norms it established, but I don’t think I’d bet my house on it.",mckiesey,2023-02-22T14:36:58,1
"It's valid in that there is substance to the idea that no, the US would not appreciate China meddling in Mexico.  Most people accept that Russia has a valid reason to not want US influence directly at their borders and I don't think that's even a particularly controversial thing to point out.  The part where things go off the rails is in the response to it.  When the response to that act is an invasion of another sovereign nation under pretext so flimsy you can use it as window glass, *that* is where the problem is.  Similarly, if the US had responded to Chinese interference in its own interest in Mexico, there would justifiably be outrage if the US decided to handle that by invading Mexico with the intent of killing supporters of the pro-Western government and installing a friendly/puppet government.",HeloRising,2023-02-24T02:44:32,1

"During the cold war, I believe the US intervened in other nations either when they were a direct security threat to the US (like Cuba) or an ideological threat (at least that is my opinion). If China placed missiles or army bases in Mexico I think the US would intervene. If all Mexico did was try to enter an EU-style agreement with China or try to have China guarantee its security from an American invasion (both by its own will, not by some Chinese influence operation), for some reason I feel like the US would not.   The Mexico example is pretty far fetched, but if we say for the sake of debate that Europe is in the ""American sphere of influence"", then you can already see certain countries in Europe allowing critical infrastructure like ports to be sold to Chinese companies, and people like Macron going around during the Trump years and saying NATO was ""brain dead"" and Europe needed to develop strategic autonomy. Europe became reliant on Russian gas, and American warnings and attempts to stop Nord Stream 2 were ignored in Germany until Russia invaded Ukraine. By all indications, Russia thought it had such a foothold in Europe that it would be able to invade Ukraine without major consequences. You can see Biden's response has clearly not been to threaten the EU, but to exercise soft power instead.",ref7187,2023-02-22T16:17:25,1

"Not just that.  The US deployed missiles in Italy and Turkey, but when the USSR tried to put similar missiles in Cuba the US basically threatened a nuclear WW3.  I think you should also [read this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mongoose) and in my opinion what Russia does now is almost ""tame"" compared to what happened during the Cold War. We're just not used to it because for the last 30 years (after the fall of the USSR) there was no great power that could rival the US and we never had any decent coverage on our own actions.  But to answer your question: I don't think you should try to argue or justify international relations. The reality is that countries basically do whatever they can get away with. Good and evil are man-made ideas and no country will stop doing what it does because someone argues that it's morally wrong.  Pointing out that something is hypocritical doesn't matter. People generally accept that punching someone to stop them is good, whereas someone punching you to stop you is bad. It's all just a matter of point of view.",Hapsbum,2023-02-25T11:30:51,3
"Bay of Pigs was not a US invasion. It was an attempt by Cubans to start a military revolution, funded and backed by US money and covert operations resources. In short, Bay of Pigs is much more directly analogous to the separatist movements in the Donbas region that had been ongoing well before the Russian invasion. Notably, those movements were largely accepted by the international community, even if the West was opposed to them in much the same way Cuba and Russia were opposed to the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Absolutely nothing about the situation is hypocritical. There are actual historical examples of the US doing exactly what the US is saying Russia should do in this case, and not doing what Russia should not do. It's that simple.",mormagils,2023-02-22T14:20:51,5
