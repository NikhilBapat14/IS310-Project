"The more the job market looks up and Americans keep spending, the more leftists pray for a recession.   They are mad when things look like they might turn out OK. They were told it wasn’t *supposed* to happen. We’re *supposed* to enter into a recession!!!!    Many want China to win a trade war and for Russia and Ukraine to continue to fight, just so they can stick it to President Trump. Just like they wanted COVID deaths to pile up for political points.",slagathor_zimblebob,2025-05-02T12:53:21,23
"Employers added 177,000 jobs in April *despite Temu not being able to sell fake knockoffs of their products at 75%-off discounts anymore, now needing to charge 50%-off thus defeating the entire purpose of using Temu instead of Wal-Mart in the first place.*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-02T13:51:04,4
