So Trump's FBI conducted a weak and biased investigation then Biden's FBI came in and cleaned it up properly? And we're thanking Kash for some bizarro reason? Seems totally on brand.,kulshan,2025-05-07T13:11:28,3

They're going through all the FBI documents because the FBI in 2017 had an agenda. I think the FBI should be required to tell the full findings to the president at the time.,lady__jane,2025-05-07T13:04:35,-8
Trump wanted to reform the FBI - thought it was corrupt at the time. The FBI having a separate agenda from that of the executive office had not occurred to me - I thought they were required to tell the information they knew.,lady__jane,2025-05-07T13:16:01,-4
"Kash revealed the attacker's letters and other evidence of targeting the GOP, not a general domestic attack - it's a targeted political attack. That would be good to know if protection is needed, so it's relevant to Sen. Scalise.   It's also worthy of investigation in case an outside source (such as a foreign source) is the cause. They didn't tell the president at the time. Should they have been required to tell him?",lady__jane,2025-05-07T13:35:26,0

"It's to offer information that won't be available here - to offer a POV to consider. Especially on gray areas.  It's a gray area about the FBI - should they be required to tell all? To whom? There was evidence of the shooter targeting the GOP specifically - the whole group - and that wasn't revealed. Should it have been? What is the FBI's agenda?   I was an Independent two months ago and started researching how to get fair news. It's the first time I've seen major networks not pick up stories that tell another side rather than their side. If you search, this story is not available, and the role of the FBI should be discussed.   Edit to add: Both sides of the media need to show things so they can be talked about - not suppressed. 59% of the Republicans don't believe the media after the Biden fiasco - will they listen to CNN if they don't trust them? If CNN and MSNBC suppress, that's just confirming why they shouldn't be trusted by GOP - which leads to a crap cycle of not getting the other's message but just seeing adversaries.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T13:21:13,0

His letters were immediately reported on back in 2017 days after the shooting. Thankfully Biden's FBI cleaned up Trump's mess. Wonder why it took a administration change from Republican to Democrat to update the conclusion of the investigation.,kulshan,2025-05-07T13:56:16,1
Scalise is not a senator and had protection with him at the time,Comfortable-Policy70,2025-05-07T14:23:25,1
">""After Shooting, Some in GOP Blame Incitement by Democrats""  ??? The story wasn't about Democrats at all? Where are you hearing this in Scalise's talk? It was about the FBI saying it was ""suicide by cop"" in 2017 - wrong. Then ""domestic terrorism"" in 2021 - better, still not all. Then, in 2025, they find all this evidence that shows it was a targeted attack, and boy, it would have been nice for the targets to know so they could protect themselves in the future. And the FBI didn't tell them or the president. They operated as a separate entity.   The issue is what oversight does the FBI have? Are they autonomous? Should they be a secretive, powerful agency that is separate? Or make the FBI more about being the right hand to help fight crime only?",lady__jane,2025-05-08T01:34:12,1
"I think about talking about the role of the FBI - whether they should be open or not. Should they be a helpmeet and arm of the executive branch, or should they be a separate strongarm entity?   The argument was that the FBI has a lot of political power that is unchecked - as someone mentioned - J Edgar Hoover. Are they meant to? Or should they have some oversight from an elected official? What if there is corruption? Who oversees or puts it in check?",lady__jane,2025-05-07T15:46:38,1
"It's actual evidence that wasn't shown earlier - Scalise should have been told if he was on a hit list that the FBI found and didn't show. The admin is digging into all the different places and revealing discrepancies or places that are corrupt. I want to see if they will show corruption that is anti-GOP too because that's the real test. The GOP would hit back at them, but ? Truth is truth.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T13:40:50,-3

">The issue is what oversight does the FBI have?  Actually no that isn't the issue.  See the FBI used to be an independent agency until the merged DHS.  The FBI and all agencies have oversight.  Trump could have called for an internal review by an IG.  There are checks and balances, but notice this is the case republicans are attacking.   How about 1/6?  Oh right they attacked the Congressional Report.  They attacked the FBI.    Its always only about cases and issues where they have a political stake.",TintedApostle,2025-05-08T06:37:53,1
The reason the FBI has a Director that should have a 10 year term is to maintain separation from political control.  Trump fired the last FBI director and the republicans appointed Patel.  Hoover had no limitation on tenure.  The 10 year came because of him.  The problem is as long as republicans are appointing based on politics there is no check.  As long as one party ingnores its oath to the Constitution there can be no check.,TintedApostle,2025-05-07T15:55:37,1
"Its interpretive dancing to say this was a ""hit list"".  What they are saying is they didn't agree with the FBI assessments at the time, but the fact a list existed wasn't hidden.  The goal is create a narrative that ""Dems are violent"" and that has been the goal from the start.  I will point out who was president in 2017. - Trump.  Examples of goal driven interpretation..  ""“Hodgkinson was facing many personal difficulties.”  These factors support the argument that Hodgkinson was willing to die. However, they do not distinguish between whether Hodgkinson was a domestic terrorist or simply suicidal.""  It also doesn't distinguish if he hated hamburgers.  More proof:  A straight up insertion by republicans of the following which is not FBI  ""Hodgkinson was a radical, left-wing political extremist, seeking to affect the conduct of government by assassinating Republican congressmen.""  There was the goal.",TintedApostle,2025-05-07T13:51:56,3

"It is due to the FBI's history that a good portion of the populace does not trust police, and if you dig you can see how it was systemic through the years. Almost as if by design. I don't believe there are any safe agencies any longer. I'm really not sure how a totally biased and unabashed Trump loyalist who came into office with a political hit list is going to restore balance and impartiality to an agency that never had it. How can such a unilateral one sided perspective bring unity and  trust to an agency notorious for it's bias and prejudice. That doesn't seem to make logical sense.",kulshan,2025-05-07T14:35:17,1
"Did you read this? You don't get shot for coming unarmed into the Capitol. You are detained - you're not shot and killed. And you don't shoot blindly and cause a relatively peaceful protest to become a riot.  The cop (PA) that died was the protestor. The other one died - medical the examiner said it was of natural causes, same as the other two protestors. This is a total spin by the media in the worst way possible. They were trying to tamp the backlash from shooting and killing a U.S. citizen who was in the Capitol (allowed) who was protesting. I'm just flabbergasted.

"His reasoning was that the beaurocracy was gaining too much unelected power - that power should remain in the three branches of govt. I don't know how this will go.   Here's one example - a bureaucracy (US Dept of Agriculture) told a [South Dakota farmer who had lived on his land for generations](https://www.tsln.com/news/indictment-ranch-couple-faces-criminal-charges-over-federal-property-boundary/) that his cattle were eating on 25 acres of federal land, They would have to spend $250k each and 10 years in jail. No one responded to their messages, and they were told to find someone to care for their kids while they were in prison. So - they're (Noem?) now reviewing all the demand request chains to make sure people can't go to prison because of bureaucrat issue. I don't fully understand the range of power - just what that instance was.

Here's one part of why they didn't like him - but Trump did because he's not as ensconced in FBI politics:  >Democrats complained about Patel’s lack of management experience compared with previous FBI directors and they highlighted incendiary past statements that they said called his judgment into question.  Also, remarks about Jan. 6, etc. And if you go to Snopes, the whole thing seems out of scope. Patel wants to look into it, which is valid. He also says he doesn't want to look back in anger, etc.   I think we'll see. I like that he wants the FBI to be more based in finding criminals for all administrations, as a helper rather than some strong-arm entity.
