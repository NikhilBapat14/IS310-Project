Our immigration is broken. Bring back the bracero program, but don’t be vile and abuse the workers like we did. We need properly regulated immigration that helps make sure we maintain some level of cultural integration while preserving diversity and such. Democrats will fumble this. It’s what we will do. We will let divisive people like Hogg and broadly unappealing career politicians like Kamala play the game and lose again and again. But literally the rest of the Democrat agenda could be won and strengthened FDR style if we were willing to concede some to the middle. Not giving them whatever they want or playing nice, but carving out some things they care about. Anyway, I appreciate what Hogg is doing but he is a very very unlikable figure to the right. We can have strong but humane immigration laws.  Also, while implementing things we can bring back mental health institutions and attack gun violence sideways.

"There's lots of reasons.   As a progressive who supports gun ownership, here's the spiel.  1) Any effort to ban guns in a way that would matter would have to involve confiscation. I do believe the effort to carry that out would be at the level of the civil war. I'm not exaggerating. I think it would take literally occupation and military raids.   2) While the adage that guns cant stop tanks is true, the primary weapons of the two wars we just lost were improvised explosives and rifles.  3) Civil war is not the worst outcome of what's currently happening. If society crumbles, I don't want the only armed people to be MAGA men in large black trucks.   4) From an electoral standpoint, gun confiscation is not a winner. And it's also not possible politically or logistically. You might as well run on banning cars. 40k dead per year, plus pollution. You might say the numbers demand it but- it's just not practical.   5) ""Common sense"" gun control is a popular concept, but only because no one defines what it means. For me, id support 18+ : Possess 21+ : Purchase  All buyers require a letter of endorsement from a gun club or similar organization. If you consistently issue endorsements to people who use the weapons illegally- that can open you to liability.

"How are Progressives so rare and irrelevant, yet they’re the reason that the party is not or will not succeed in elections? Almost 44% of Democrats in the House are in the CPC, so they’re clearly popular amongst a wide range of voters.  The Gallup poll you shared provides a MOE of ±6, which is worth considering. Additionally, 51% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents either want the party to be more liberal or stay the same, compared to 46% who want it to be more moderate. So, you’re realistically not even proving that the party *needs* to shift towards the center.  The Pew Research survey certainly suggests there’s a large chunk of moderate Democratic voters, but it also appears that it’s self-reported. In my opinion, the reliability of those data should be questioned. Can we expect every respondent to accurately gauge how objectively conservative or liberal their views are? Some people consider Communists to be “very liberal”, and think Progressivism is just “liberal”. Others, including myself, may slightly disagree.   Maybe you’re right— I don’t know. I just struggle to see how Progressivism has been such a popular ideology for years and suddenly it deserves to be the scapegoat for the DNC’s shortcomings.

">And don't tell me he was always a centrist. I was in college at the time, I was there. 'Centrists' were not his base, his base came from the same place Bernies/AOCs does now.  I was also there. I was Obama campaign staff in '08. I think our party completely misunderstands...basically the political axis. Because as we use it, left/right and centrist/progressive are insider-track labels that are only relevant for people with a deep & historical understanding of American politics.  The people overflowing our rallies and volunteering at every event? Most of them had no background in politics. I've come to think that's a serious indicator of a healthy campaign--the ability to pull in people who don't normally get engaged in politics, and it's become clear our party in particular has forgotten how to talk to people like this. They came for the anti-establishment vibes and promises of change, which was a far more important axis to align on rather than left vs right. And I'd bet many of them also flowed from Obama to Bernie to Trump--because if you value pro/anti establishment more than left/right (especially if you're not that political and left vs right is meaningless for you), Trump is a lot closer to Obama, Bernie, and AOC than Harris was.  Most of the lit I've seen indicates Perot didn't actually spoil the '92 election, but it certainly did help Clinton. Not sure how useful it is to re-till that particular analysis--we're not likely to get more fruit now than we have any time in the last 30 years. What's less debatable is that Clinton presented himself as an outsider and ran a strong, popular wave. The same happened with Obama. All the other candidates presented themselves as hyper-insiders and it hurt them for obvious reasons.  My view is that we can easily get a popular centrist, progressive, populist, conservative--you can get someone who's popular from any part of the political spectrum. What matters most to success is that they package their perspective as anti-establishment and change focused, not where exactly the politically astute voter can triangulate them on the left/right spectrum.",Sminahin,2025-04-22T10:15:07,3
">The status quo is dead. You don’t fight fascism with people that *slightly* disagree with it yet still support the neoliberal policies that led to it.  I don't disagree at all, actually. Want to be clear with that up-front, because I suspect you think I'm coming from a different angle than I am.  >Obama was in 2008 and 2012. That’s over a decade ago. Clinton was 1992 and 1996, literally a different millennium.  Yes and no and yes. I would say this actually makes Clinton & Obama's success **more** relevant now, rather than less. Reaganomics poisoned the American economy for regular folk. By and large, people that aren't wealthy neoliberals have despised the economic status quo for decades. It was bad enough that Clinton ran a wildly successful change-focused economic campaign. And then Obama did the exact same thing a decade later, firing up the electorate about similar grievances.  Thing is, they didn't fix the status quo. As you pointed out. So things are still just as bad, but our party is now obsessively running pro-establishment centrist candidates at a time everyone hates the status quo. I would argue the more anti-establishment branded candidate has won every single campaign since the 1980s, showing there's desperate public appetite.  Imo, our party's candidates have absolutely sucked for the last \~40 years with two exceptions: Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Obvious anti-establishment reasons propelled them to victory, even as centrists. And they won *hard*. Everyone else has been a pro-establishment, low-charisma centrist using the same failed approach that undermined us in 2000, 2004, almost 2008, 2016, and 2024.

What are they going to do, oppose their own positions?!? That is literally the problem the democrats the past 40 years. People don't want wishy-washy, 'above it all' moderates, that embody the inauthentic caricature of an establishment politician. They want the exact opposite of that.  I mostly agree completely. I just think that people will accept sufficiently anti-establishment branding from all across the political spectrum. And yes, I say ""branding"" specifically because I think the seeming is more important than the reality here, at least for getting elected. George W Bush and Donald Trump were both able to successfully frame themselves as anti-establishment political outsiders and win largely off that.  Your average person doesn't actually think in political-enough terms to actually understand centrist/center right/progressive distinctions.  An anti-establishment branded centrist is absolutely possible. We may quibble with how anti-establishment they actually are (I disagree with your blanket characterization that an anti-establishment centrist is impossible--seems more a statement of limited imagination based on the centrists currently in power), but perception of anti-establishment positions has been enough to get you to the White House for a long time now.",Sminahin,2025-04-22T11:48:18,2

"I’ve not said anywhere that anyone should disarm. Please, take a look back and actually read what I wrote. I think I’ve made it abundantly clear that any gun laws that protect innocents will have to wait until after this regime is handled. There’s only one country that faces gun violence in schools like the U.S. does, and that cannot be addressed by those who would throw a protestor into a slave concentration camp but say “these things happen” when a school shooting happens. So your attempt to paint my argument as something other than what I am saying is failing. Maybe you have poor reading comprehension? I’d rather think that than you’re operating in bad faith misconstruing my words.   I’ve sacrificed more for the cause than you’d know and am not stupid enough to put into words online what/how I have sacrificed nor what I’d do to stymie and disrupt this regime.   I’m not sure why you’re against keeping guns out of the hands of rapists, stalkers, and domestic abusers…but hey, you’re the one suggesting we shouldn’t have common sense gun laws. Maybe you’re afraid of losing your own guns if that were to pass? Idk. It’s weird though.",Gardening_investor,2025-04-23T09:33:05,1
"Some countries have that number at 0. You can be flippant about how small it is, but that’s 400 families per year missing their loved ones. I’m not so crass about human life I guess.",Gardening_investor,2025-04-22T10:05:59,1
"I am not trying to misconstrue your words. I am simply trying to point out that “common sense gun control” pushes towards disarmament which was the playbook from the nazis and I have provided evidence from a first hand account. Look at what is happening in Colorado. They just passed legislation prohibiting the transfer or sale of semi automatic firearms. Semi automatic firearms consist of most firearms including those designed for hunting. If you want to see a blue wave in the midterms, the democrats need to stop yelling into an echo chamber and embrace those in the middle by dropping the gun control debate. I and many like me will not vote for any party that campaigns on stripping the people of their rights.    Rapists, domestic abusers, and felons are already prohibited from having guns. We already have federal background checks when purchasing from an authorized FFL , and waiting periods have been implemented in most states. School shootings are a result of a mental health crisis. It’s not like the gun pulls its own trigger. Let’s stop blaming the tool. On another note, firearms prevent far more rapes and attacks because they are an amazing equalizer. A 5’ 100lb individual can stop a 250lb attacker seeking to cause them harm by simply drawing the weapon and if necessary using it.",CShelton17,2025-04-23T10:13:04,0
"Life and freedom come at a cost. Any unnecessary loss of life is a tragedy but if you want to go down that road, there are many more ways in which people unnecessarily lose their lives through preventable methods. 400 is a tragedy but I'd rather concern myself with helping people have affordable food and housing and healthcare and see that number eventually drop then trying half-measures and bandaids we've already tried to turn around and say well it wasn't enough, this next one will work for sure.",ColdTheory,2025-04-22T10:56:04,1
"Ah there it is, the slippery slope argument  Bruh you love your guns more than children’s lives and that’s your business, but I find that disgusting. Go have this bad faith argument with someone else.",Gardening_investor,2025-04-23T10:21:58,1
"Yes, but you’re fixating on rifles when I said “common sense gun control.” You’re saying that the country cannot possibly pass laws to improve the lives of the working class AND a gun control bill that mandates nationwide background checks and 3 day waiting periods regardless of location of sale?   FDR launched multiple pieces of legislation and executive orders that dramatically changed the shape of the country for the better. I’m not sure why you’d settle for an either or situation when both is possible.",Gardening_investor,2025-04-22T12:21:22,1
More children have died under the control of tyrannical governments than all school shootings combined. If you can guarantee me that the US government can never become tyrannical then I will vote blue and even give up my guns with a smile on my face… but you can’t because we are watching tyranny unfold before our very eyes.,CShelton17,2025-04-23T10:28:01,0
"You mentioned the Assault weapon ban which is why I mentioned rifles. Which by the way, the first major and modern school shooting, Columbine, occurred during the assault weapon ban. And evidently we haven't been able to accomplish both at the same time. While what you propose isn't terribly unreasonable, still, I'd rather spend my efforts focused on economic justice.

"If you’re not voting against fascism, you’re voting for it. There’s no “middle ground” with fascism. Either you voted AGAINST it for a candidate that could win, or you voted FOR it by enabling their victory.

"Lmao great mental gymnastics. I vote my conscious and for my beliefs. If more people had the spine to do the same, instead of falling into the “lesser of 2 evils” fallacy then we wouldn’t be here.   The “you didn’t vote for my guy so you must be a fascist” makes you intolerant. How intolerant to intolerance can you be before you become the intolerant one? An interesting paradox to think about. Good luck winning over new voters with that mindset. If anything you’ll push them to the other side, kind of like what happened in the past election.",CShelton17,2025-04-23T12:19:00,1
