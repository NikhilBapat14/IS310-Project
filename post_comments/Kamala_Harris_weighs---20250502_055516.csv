She won't run again in 2028.  We need another candidate that has more pull than she did.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-02T06:01:39,44
"Governor? Fine. President? No. I voted for her and I would again in the general, but no. And I think she should expect to get destroyed in the primary. Not because that’s best for the party or the country but only because the loss devastated morale.  There was a report leading up to 2020 that Bernie was saying that he didn’t think America would vote for a woman President to Elizabeth Warren. I’m unfortunately inclined to agree with him, despite what a militant feminist I am. I would gladly vote for a woman to lead the ticket and the party and the country and the world. But I’m now of the opinion (backed up by facts) that America prefers rapists to women… So we may be stuck trying to educate the masses first. I’d love to be proven wrong on that, but… I’m righteously indignant and I think a majority of present-day America unfortunately only recognizes white men to be able to lead. The propaganda worked, unfortunately.",somuchacceptable,2025-05-02T06:08:23,48

"Controversial take here, but the U.S. just isnt ready to elect a woman president. These women need to stop trying to make history and just step down right now. Given the current state of things, there are just more important issues. Someday we will have a female president, just not now. All they are doing is causing unneeded damage right now.

"I think the smartest thing that Democrats can do for 2028 is to open primaries in every state to all voters. Make sure the candidate you choose is broadly supported by democrats, independents and moderate conservatives. Kamala can run but in that environment she will lose. You probably end up with a Basheer type candidate, but at least someone that can trounce Trump to the point that rigging won’t be effective except in the southern states.",Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-05-02T09:27:08,2

"I think the chances are reasonably good that Musk and other wealthy tech backers did actually significantly swing the vote for a Trump win in key areas by various nefarious means (vote data manipulation and worrying fake texts claiming to be from democrats). That said though, the democrats need to field a white straight male candidate with experience, intelligence, and empathy ideally probably 45-55ish.

Have you ever witnessed her on the campaign trail? When she ran for Senator of CA in '16 she had a few interviews where she was so lethargic as to appear hungover.  That fact alongside her vigorous prosecution of cannabis violators while she was AG when POV was for decriminalization makes her unsavory as a candidate.,sapaterson,2025-05-02T06:17:22,-3

"3 things   - If Warren had dropped out prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would've likely won the nomination in 2020. - Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton were uninspiring candidates that both felt like they were foisted on voters, not picked by them, pushing moderate views. Harris championed her Republican support, cannibalizing some leftist support, and given the absolute layup of a question ""what would you do differently than Biden"" said ""nothing"" not once but TWICE - the second time on Fox News, which would've been an excellent platform to swing the missing voters. - Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton lost their elections, but if ~70k votes had gone differently in the swing states for Clinton or if ~116k had gone differently for Harris, they'd have won (even though Harris would've still lost the popular vote).   There is a formula for victory. Yes, being a woman has a studied inherent challenge. Boston U estimates a 1-3% automatic hit for just being a woman. But when Biden's win really came down to both the national negative mood to Trump as an incumbent in 2020 combined with the fact that if just ~47k votes had flipped in the swings that Trump would've still won, you can come to see that there's more than just being a woman that caused these two losses. I'm deeply confident that if not for COVID, Trump would've won reelection (losing the popular vote by much less too). The anti-incumbent, reactionary inflation fear that affected voting attitudes globally last year cannot be ignored for contributing to Trump's victory.    If there's a woman as the next nominee - and there doesn't have to be, but if there is because they are the fair winner of a primary - they need to be someone who's consistent, inspiring, and whose policy proposals actually sound like they'll fix problems and not just put tape over them. They'll have extra wind in their sails if 2028 is somehow a fair election given what Trump is doing.   e: grammar in point 2",alabasterskim,2025-05-02T07:21:36,6
"That report about Bernie was a lie. The only reason Bernie ran in 2016 was because Elizabeth Warren refused to. He thought *she* could have won and pressured her to run agains Hilary, only for her to run against him, call him a sexist, then split the progressive vote.

"She lost after having to jumpstart a campaign out of nowhere and having just over 3 months to run. If we go back to May 2024, Kamala was not planning to run for president.

"> If Warren had dropped out prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would've likely won the nomination in 2020.  He likely wouldn't have.  Her voters were generally pretty evenly split between Biden and Bernie for their second choice.  Polls having it be either 46/47 or 36/43.  In the former case not a single Super Tuesday state flips and for the later only a single state does.   Furthermore, one could argue that is Warren dropped that Bloomberg would have also joined in dropping and he generally did as well as Warren on Super Tueday, but I doubt his supporter's second choice was nearly as evenly split.",bootlegvader,2025-05-02T23:46:59,0

"It doesn't matter what her tagline is. There are far too many voters who will not vote for a woman no matter what.

The easiest is children: If she has kids, she should be at home supporting them. If she won't support her own kids, she won't support yours. If she doesn't have kids, she's anti-family and is going to try to other women from having children. She's pro-abortion, and ""many people are saying she's had six abortions this year.""
