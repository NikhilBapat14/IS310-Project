Sure a one time 5K bonus is really going to convince people to jump into the shit show that federal employment these days.

These controllers went home on trauma leave. They're still employed and will work again. They kept controlling until someone relieved them. Imagine talking to ten to thirty planes at a time and keeping them separated and on track only to lose the ability to see them. Dig yourself out of that hole with only your memory of what each plane was doing with your eyes closed. Now imagine it could happen any time with any number of aircraft you're responsible for. Is that an airport you'd want to fly to?   Kirby said this move was a good idea and he supported it. Everyone the involved knew these issues would happen,krulos_caveman,2025-05-06T07:28:22,11
