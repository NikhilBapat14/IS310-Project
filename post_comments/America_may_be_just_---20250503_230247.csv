"I suggest that it is already experiencing an economic shock as the market recognises that Trump has backed the US economy into a corner.   China is cancelling contracts for imports from the US and is now using this economic madness to undermine and displace the US from its traditional markets.   The EU , for example , is playing hard to get with China for the time being but it surely must recognise that this is its best option in the absence of a reliable and trustworthy US trade relationship.  The USA has poisoned its international trade and recovery from this disaster appears impossible now that trust and confidence in the USA is evaporating.  It is the economic shock of an erosion in trust and confidence which will now be cemented by empty ships , inflation and unemployment.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T23:20:49,180

"Ok, let me be the first to say, I'm Sorry that someone has done that to you. especially the Pok√©mon cards. Collectables take the hardest his in this scenario because so many people buy and sell them. It's not so much resellers in general, but rather that everyone under the sun buys and resells them. This has been going on forever and a day on anything wildly popular (Cards, Bennie Babies, Precious Moments, etc. Anyone looking to use these as an investment is going to have a bad time. The prices are driven up by popularity and then people come out of the woodwork to participate. I am not that kind of reseller. Not the Fad collectables that is. If I find them at a garage sale, or by some fluke, I may buy them then, but I am not looking to buy packs of them and then turn around and resell them. If you are a player, that sucks because it is near impossible to get what you need without paying insane amounts for it. So With that aside, I hope you can listen why reselling is not the demon that many people think it is. First, blaming resellers for taking all the cheap stuff. You need cheap stuff because you cannot afford to buy it new, correct? So the real villain's are the large corporations. They are price fixing, causing an artificial inflation (artificial because a normal inflation you would not have record profits, however, the major corporations have been reporting record profits for the last few years, so artificial inflation). This coupled with low or unreasonable pay to match the rise in costs means you have to look for deals just to survive. Am I close here? It's important to mention where that money goes when you buy a product at any retail store, into excessive pay to the high level managers and owners. Resellers, on the flip side do a massive service to the community. We don't just shop thrift stores, we shop garage sales, Estate sales, Rummage sales, Thrift stores, or where ever we can find a bargin. What's more, we bring it together in one place, mostly online. So we centralize and incorporate a shipment. Yes, we got the bargin you wanted, but now those products can reach more people. But that isn't the biggest part. Remember when I mentioned that the corporations just give their CEOs a bigger bonus, they don't add to the local community like we do. Every single penny goes back into the economy I earn. Granted, Eventually I would like to save some, but even then, we are not talking millions. What's more, I pay taxes. Many of these corporations DON'T, or pay less than my small business does. We are also among those small businesses that are the largest employer combined in the U.S. So I am sorry, someone stole your great deal, but I think you are blaming us for societies problems when you should be blaming the real culprits. Oh, and btw, often we buy stuff that the standard people don't at thrift stores, and various sales. Most people don't go to a garage sale for toilet towers, but we do because we know were to go resell it, and my customers have been happy about that because I was able to find it and make it available for them.",bsmknight,2025-05-04T12:50:22,1

"So, as a Canadian the problem we are seeing with this is that even if Congress has those powers in place, the American people support a president right now who does not respect civil or criminal law, the Supreme Court or any other circuits, or the  Constitution. Yes I know not all Americans. But still, 77 million people voted for this president and the last poll I saw had no one changing their vote. This is dismaying.   Therefore, all of this (gestures broadly) could happen again. Someone could be elected who will behave just as lawlessly, or even more so.   The power of change is entirely with the people to elect a trustworthy leader, again and again and again and again and again.  Permanent damage has been done and our election result was not just an anti Trump vote as the news bluntly reports. It is a vote for a strong pivot away from reliance on the US economy and forging new trade relationships in new markets, and we can do it. It is also about ensuring for our sovereignty, and threatening that will take just as many generations to be forgotten. It is an unforgivable betrayal.

"Sigh, normally I don't carry on these conversations, but educating people on this is so very important to help people understand we are on the same team. But, with that said, if I may, state this a different way that may help. One situation, I picked up some ostomy bags, those are the bags people use if they had an organ removed. I went to a thrift store and saw them there, but I wasn't interested at the time. 6 months later, they were still there. I picked them up for $6 a box. Within a few weeks I sold them for $30. By your definition, I just robbed someone else of that opportunity, but here is why there is some ... challenges with that way of thinking. 1. This person I sold them to was in California, completely across the country, he had no way to get them, 2. New in the box is $60 for this type of bag. The customer was so happy I saved him $30 PER box. 3. These bags have an expiration date because of the material can degrade over too long a period, so if they didn't sell very soon, they would have been worthless. 4. The Thrift store owner was so happy I bought them as he was about to throw them away to make room for things that sold quicker, as they were taking up space. So With all that said, if I had not been there: 1. The customer was on a budget and would have had to choose between this required life device or not paying his rent, 2. the bags would have expired as NO one was buying them. 3. the Thrift store person would never had made any money on them to give to their charity they represented. Now, This is an extreme situation, but it is to the point that we are not ruining everything as you so put it. Now consider this, estate sales and garage sales would not make as many sales without us. How many times have you had a garage sale and not sold everything? The fact is, most of your sales were probably resellers that just don't tell you. I.e. we help move things along much faster, this creates tax revenue and creates jobs. Now that I have been doing this a year, I can easily pick out the resellers. So we have increased sales at various venues and businesses that normally don't see that much foot traffic. This is because we get the products to the people who cannot get to sed location. Thrift stores do not have the capacity to put everything online, we are an army of people who do that for them. Our fee is buying their items at a price so they move from their stores. They see revenue and get the money for donations that they normally didn't see. The fact is, I get your frustrated, but we provide a much needed service. Without us,  garage sale, estate sales, Thrift stores, rummage sales would suffer as they cannot reach the people we can reach outside of their venue and location and thus would see a major decline in sales.  I help more people by doing this, and getting those products they need and want to them. I'm sorry you missed out on deals because of this, but you really should be mad at not getting paid your worth at your day job than trying to shame me when I am actually helping our communities and the local economy.",bsmknight,2025-05-04T14:06:29,1
