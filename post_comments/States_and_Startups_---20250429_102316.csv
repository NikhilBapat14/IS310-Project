I live in Ohio. I would not trust my state to regulate a nuclear reactor. Also what's left unsaid in this article is the lack of adequate storage space for nuclear waste. ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-04-29T10:32:00,6
"In early April, Valar Atomics, in addition to another nuclear startup, Deep Fission, as well as the states of Florida, Louisiana, and Arizona’s state legislature, signed onto a [lawsuit](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69506239/state-of-texas-v-us-nuclear-regulatory-commission/) against the NRC. The lawsuit, originally filed in December by Texas, Utah, and nuclear company Last Energy, blames the NRC for “so restrictively regulat\[ing\] new nuclear reactor construction that it rarely happens at all.”  The US has historically been the global powerhouse of nuclear energy, yet only [three reactors](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61963) have come online over the past 25 years, all behind schedule and with ballooning budgets. Meanwhile, other countries, like China and South Korea, have raced ahead with construction of reactors of all sizes. Some nuclear advocates say that the US’s regulation system, which imposes cumbersome requirements and ultra-long timelines on projects, is largely to blame for this delay—especially when it comes to developing new designs for smaller reactors—and that some reactors should be taken from the NRC’s purview altogether. But others have concerns about potential attempts to bypass the country’s nuclear regulations for specific designs.  The NRC has long been criticized for its ultra-slow permitting times, inefficient processes, and contentious back-and-forth with nuclear companies. “The regulatory relationship in the US has been described as legalistic and adversarial for nuclear,” says Nick Touran, a licensed nuclear engineer who runs the website [What Is Nuclear](https://whatisnuclear.com/). “That is kind of uniquely American. In other countries, like France and China, the regulators are more cooperative.”  The lawsuit takes these criticisms one step further, claiming that by regulating smaller reactors, the NRC is misreading a crucial piece of nuclear legislation. In 1954, Congress passed the [Atomic Energy Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-1630/pdf/COMPS-1630.pdf), which created modern nuclear regulation in the US. That law mandated regulations for nuclear facilities that used nuclear material “in such quantity as to be of significance to the common defense and security” or that use it “in such manner as to affect the health and safety of the public.”  Read the full story: [https://www.wired.com/story/nrc-lawsuit-nuclear-energy-reactor-smr-regulation-regulatory-commission/](https://www.wired.com/story/nrc-lawsuit-nuclear-energy-reactor-smr-regulation-regulatory-commission/)",wiredmagazine,2025-04-29T10:24:49,2

All of the waste from all nuclear power generation in history can fit inside a highschool gym. The problem of nuclear waste is due to nuclear **weapons**. The absolute ignorance about nuclear power is probably the biggest knowledge blind spot among liberals and progressives.,Good-Gold-6515,2025-04-29T10:48:11,1
"That's the waste from nuclear fuel. The waste from contaminated materials is a lot, lot higher. Everything from pipes that carried the water the nuclear piles sit in to the safety equipment the workers wore. It's usually pretty low-grade stuff that only needs to sit for a few decades to ""cool"" off, but it still needs to be treated as hazmat.",EV-187,2025-04-30T03:07:02,1
