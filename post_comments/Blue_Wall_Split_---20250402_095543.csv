"given how close these have been in the last 2 election, there is no reason they can't split. they almost did in 2016     one thing to keep in mind is that EVs are going to change.. i don't think before 2028 but before 2032... and that will be from northern blue states to southern red states.. theoretical most of these states may be purple in the future but florida/texas have been red the last few eleciotns",Rivercitybruin,2025-04-02T21:12:06,10
"I doubt they would have a split, these three states have large blue collar working voters so unless trump targets something like fracking I doubt they wouldn’t vote the same. As for who they’d vote for I feel it depends on how much the trump presidency helps or hurts the economy with tariffs and if the democrats actually put up a good campaign",EpicCow69,2025-04-02T17:12:56,3
"OP, i am not sure if you mean 1 would be D and other 2 R....     or if one of these states will turn fairly hard R....... i think that is a possibility     hopefully.. D turns a combo of weakly RED states.",Rivercitybruin,2025-04-02T23:52:01,1
"I'd say the most likely scenario is blue Michigan, red Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Michigan is the only one of the three with a Dem Governor and two Dem Senators, and while their House delegation is majority Republican, it is only by one.  This is all speculation, though. One could make the case that it could be blue Wisconsin, since it had the narrowest margin of the three in 2024. One could even make the case for blue Michigan/Wisconsin, red Pennsylvania.",CptPatches,2025-04-03T16:17:31,1
"Of course it's possible. The thing is all swing states going to one candidate is always more likely than them being split, because swing states only split in super close elections.  But sure an election than comes down to the wire could have the closest states split.",Dr_thri11,2025-04-04T12:33:26,1
"based on the last 3 presidential elections its more fair to call them purple now.      Trump will be gone by then, it just depends how the economy is doing, IMO.   if unemployment is low and in 2028 prices are the same as today, I think the (R)s have a good chance,  regardless of what prices do over the next 6 months due to  applying tariff rates at 1/2 what 60 countries are charging us.      Honestly the tariffs are good , specifically for many of the blue collar workers, since the threat of sending their jobs over seas is all but dead for the next 4 years.  BUT how many non blue collar workers in those states may flip their votes.      IT workers, managers, construction (whose workers could benefit from deportations & ICE)       **Goods-producing, excluding agriculture and utilities** is the largest private sector employee according to the BLS.   so ... who knows,  they might very well be better off in 4 years, with a 'free trade' politician scaring them away.      not sure how the rest of the country will be reacting though.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T17:36:25,-8
"The blue wall is very much an illusion, Vance will sweep them in ‘28 with larger margins due to his relatable OH persona.",CCPCanuck,2025-04-02T18:38:00,-16
"I can speak to the construction piece - right now you have the twin specters of a wave of retirements, and developers frozen in the headlights because of uncertainty about commodity prices. Housing starts in February 2025 were down 3% YOY. Keep an eye on the March number. If it's low, don't count on ICE deportations driving up wages - look instead for blue collar unemployment and increased housing prices.",GiantPineapple,2025-04-02T17:48:48,6
"I’m skeptical.  The problem is a lot of of the blue collar jobs we DO have here rely on foreign elements somewhere along the line.   All those car parts they use in the factories here will go up. This makes the car itself go up and will likely reduce the sales, which will lead to layoffs. Blue collar work is likely to take a massive hit as materials become more expensive.   Ironically the people who may benefit the most are tech workers because code isn’t imported and the Indians undercutting those workers might get booted but I’m not sure if he’s going to do that since it would raise costs for the tech bros.  By the time some of these manufacturing jobs possibly reshore, in 8-10 years, we’ll probably have robots capable of doing most of them and the role who voted for this will be 8-10 years older.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-02T18:50:43,6
What blue collar construction jobs are getting sent overseas?   Am I confused?,ThatsARatHat,2025-04-02T18:15:43,2
"Sorry for the bad napkin math, but if housing starts drop by 3%,  but ICE deports 3% of the work force, wouldn't that keep all the construction workers still employed?      and google search says 13.7% of the us construction workforce are here illegally.  If ICE scares them off the job sites, the US workers could be in a position to at least get the hours they want, if not have room to ask for more money.      I could see the increased house prices though.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T17:51:59,-3
"reduced sales will make the price go down though.   We have to think this through not just happy or doom path but all possible paths, and what each initial affect will cause down the chain.      imported steel costs go up, well then US steels becomes competitive.  foreign made car prices go up, well then many Detroit plants that are at 60% capacity increase.  Me as an IT worker or someone as an accountant will see higher prices and likely no raises.  but out of work plant and car workers get jobs.      The only thing we can be certain is there's no ""this will be X across the entire economy"" answer.   anyone who says its all negative or all positive is wrong.  that's all we know.      There's many US plants running well below capacity.  the UAW chief who hated trump and told everyone Trump was awful recently came out and admitted the tariffs are great for his workers.  and he had nothing nice to say about trump (that's putting it mildly) before the election.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T20:24:01,-1
Very much so confused,WATGGU,2025-04-03T01:09:57,1
"None.   But if illegal workers no longer show up to job sites,  (estimated to be between 13-30% of the total construction work force)   the legal citizens and residents have much more job security.  they could also weather a drop in new home starts.         might even be able to get higher wages.      does that clear it up?",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T18:22:03,0
"In practice, the increased costs will just cause many of those projects to be shut down completely and everyone loses.   The houses we do build will be so expensive no one can afford them because they’ll want to build something big and expensive to maximize profit.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-02T18:43:04,7
"I'm probably not qualified to address that theory on its abstract merits, but I'd be very surprised if changes in housing starts, and deportations, were symmetrical in each blue wall state. ",GiantPineapple,2025-04-02T23:44:42,2
Yea i get it…..I just don’t think it’s realistic. As someone in a construction adjacent industry (irrigation/drainage/water main work) it seems to me like most legal workers who want these jobs get them over illegal ones.  It’s the weekend warrior types that are grabbing guys off the corner for a days pay imo.,ThatsARatHat,2025-04-02T19:13:14,3
"That is possible.  Its also possible that 80% of the projects continue reduced demand on materials will lower the prices of them, (not counting for the tariffs)   We all know if 50% of the projects got canceled the massive demand drop of lumber, nails, wiring would absolutely drop base prices.     Honestly we won't know until we know exactly how it shakes out.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T20:19:33,0
"oh there's no way they will be perfectly symmetrical.  but they should offset to some degree.  we do know its kind of impossible for prices to go so high no one buys, and then prices don't decline as a reaction  Or conversely prices go up with good sales, and home builders don't build to take advantage.  We won't have a total economic collapse.  but we won't have a golden age either.  not by a long shot.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-03T00:05:54,1

Oh I’m not saying there won’t be an impact.  I’m more so saying a lot less is gonna get done because there’s gonna be a lot less workers.,ThatsARatHat,2025-04-02T21:12:39,3
