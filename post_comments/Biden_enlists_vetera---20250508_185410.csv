I also think that was a delicate situation with no right answers, and somehow Biden pulled a bad one(s) out of thin air repeatedly. But to de facto say that's his legacy is a really bad take through any objective lens, and it's a large part of why we had Trump flip a couple of swing states, like MI.  Sure, it's going so much better now with him in charge right? As Israel says they plan to eradicate anyone who choose not to leave the Strip for them to takeover and rebuild in their own image?

"> Biden is now complicit with the starvation of children in Gaza. He had the chance to stop the escalation, but he chose not to   It's unlikely at best that Biden could have stopped this conflict completely. He is not blameless and this is one of the topics I'm least happy with Biden on. But even with another 4 years, I'm doubtful Biden could have done much more without actually provoking a full on war between us and Israel. Israel wants to be doing this just like Russia wants to be killing Ukranians. There's no excuse for sending Israel any aid whatsoever to assist with this, but you can't seriously believe that there was an alternative that made it stop under Bidens watch that didn't involve sending our military to stop it with physical force.   > Why are you blaming the voters for the DEM's lose?   Because a lot of the electorate became non-voters or protest-voters against Biden for exactly the thoughts you're laying out. I don't love picking the lesser of two evils, I hate our system.
