"Football team is a bad analogy.  What was inherited was a bloated bureaucracy pumped to far more than its usual bloat, and then any attempts at getting it back down to usual (let alone a functional level) are opposed by random bureaucrats playing god.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-01T06:53:19,-27
"I remember that 0-12 team that Trump got from Obama the first time around.   Obama, along with the problems in the economy, left Trump with a AA Credit Rating. Trump built it back to AAA. Biden came in and our credit rating dropped back down to AA and they were talking about going down to A.  I am quite sure we will get back our AAA rating.  And just like for you personally a better credit rating gets you better rates and better deals.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T06:58:56,-45

Under President Biden's tenure, the United States faced credit rating downgrades from major agencies. Fitch downgraded the U.S. long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+ in August 2023, citing concerns over higher government debt and potential economic risks from policy changes. Standard & Poor's also maintains an AA+ rating with a stable outlook, while Moody's has an Aaa rating but with a negative outlook. DBRS, however, still rates the U.S. at AAA with a stable outlook.5 These ratings reflect varying assessments of the U.S. economic and fiscal situation under Biden's policies.  The United States lost its top-tier AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor's (S&P) on August 5, 2011, during Barack Obama's presidency, when it was downgraded to AA+ due to concerns about the government's budget deficit and rising debt burden.     As of 2020, the United States had different credit ratings from various agencies. Moody's maintained the Aaa rating with a stable outlook  Facts folks... facts.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T12:08:25,7
