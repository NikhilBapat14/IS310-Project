"“Cinco de Mayo in Chicago will be canceled this year due to fears of strict immigration enforcement.”  The subversion of law is extremely clear here. Chicago is embracing flat out “rules for thee not for me” mentality.   “We will only enforce laws we like”. This is ultimate hypocrisy and the reason I’ll never live in Chicago or visit that cesspit city again. It’s too bad too, because they had a beautiful city, once.   Now it’s ripe with murder while working very hard to deny one’s right to carry and defend oneself from said murder (tight gun laws for ordinary citizens), open harboring of illegal immigration, subversion of law, and corruption, hidden underneath a facade of “everyone’s happy here, isn’t our city clean and beautiful?”",ITrCool,2025-04-15T07:33:05,64
"Wish I could say I’m disappointed, but I’m really not. Why the hell should I care about Mexico’s one off win over France in 1862? It wasn’t even a decisive war ending moment it was just a brief yay before the French came back stronger. It’s like celebrating a touchdown in the first quarter of a game you end up losing.  Now? Cinco de Mayo’s just the annual tradition of pretending to care about Mexican history while binge drinking tequila, mispronouncing queso, and wearing the most borderline offensive party store sombrero you can find. It’s not a holiday, it’s a themed hangover.",dottedoctet,2025-04-15T08:23:23,42
"If they're here legally they have nothing to worry about.  Oh that's right, Chicago is a sanctuary city.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-15T11:42:39,8

"The absolute hilarious irony of the situation is that no actual Mexicans would be there. They literally don't celebrate Cinco de Mayo in Mexico, and everyone from other countries like Guatemala and El Salvador would have no reason to celebrate either. I suppose the children of immigrants might attend because they mistakenly think it's a Mexican pride parade?",DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-15T11:24:58,21

You forgot to mention the huge mountain of nachos.  And thanks for reminding me to stock up on Cointreau.,WIlf_Brim,2025-04-15T10:53:21,10
