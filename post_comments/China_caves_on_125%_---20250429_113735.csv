"People who have been reading boring papers instead of watching exciting dramatizations (Reddit does the opposite) have known for ages that PRC needs USA more than the other way around. (Reddit will insist the opposite.) The PRC astroturf has been copypasted all over this site for every single day of its existence, it's the mainstream opinion to believe PRC is the new superpower and it's the """"fringe"""" opinion to suggest otherwise.  USA's overseas manufacturing is already migrating to other countries (like India and Vietnam) - this just speeds the process up unless PRC negotiates in ways our current admin finds agreeable (as opposed to past admins just letting them have what they want and saying we owe them.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-29T12:49:42,161
"Huh? China has no say, nor are they ones paying so what is there to 'cave' on unless they reduce theirs and do the other things Trump wants?   What am I missing here?",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-29T12:03:55,53
I see so many posts in favor of china that it just looks like ccp bot propaganda at this point. I refuse to believe so many people are brainwashed.,Negative-Negativity,2025-04-29T12:53:22,109
The CCP pretty much bought out Reddit via a $300M investment during the pre-IPO phase of going public. This site might as well labeled a Chinese communist party propaganda outlet,StratTeleBender,2025-04-29T14:44:56,46

The CCP dropped $300M into Reddit via TenCent (a CCP front company) pre-IPO. They pretty much own this site,StratTeleBender,2025-04-29T14:45:44,69

Most of it comes from hatred of trumps administration and policies. Instead of focusing on our country they will cheer on other countries because they dont want to fight for their own.,Jurclassic5,2025-04-29T13:58:09,14
They didn’t “buy out” Reddit. Their investment was worth less than 5% ownership,you_cant_prove_that,2025-04-29T19:48:27,11
Yeah I'm sure there was no alterior motive whatsoever in the communist party of china dropping $300M into a social media app via one of their proxy companies that would later: -Ban Trump related subs -harass conservatives -publish rampant pro-China propaganda via anonymous accounts  Use your brain buddy. You're not in Kansas anymore,StratTeleBender,2025-04-29T20:13:55,1
> -Ban Trump related subs -harass conservatives -publish rampant pro-China propaganda via anonymous accounts  Those could be done for free.  They didn't need to pay $300 million to run bot farms  And it was done both before and after they invested,you_cant_prove_that,2025-04-30T08:20:52,1
"Yet again, use your brain. Doing it on Reddit, an established platform, has massive value. And having complicit owners and moderators is of massive value. Don't be dumb or naive. There's a reason that Reddit is the leftist ridden shithole that it is and for all of the banning of anything remotely pro Trump or pro conservative.",StratTeleBender,2025-04-30T19:55:47,0
> There's a reason that Reddit is the leftist ridden shithole  Because the demographics of the userbase trend very left?,you_cant_prove_that,2025-05-01T08:38:46,2
"If tech platforms all ""trend to the left"" then why is the left complaining about X being a Nazi platform? It's incredibly naive of you to think that Reddit is just magically an extremist, leftist shithole because it's just magic that it only draws leftists. I guess actively banning conservatives, Trump related subs, and allowing subs to auto-ban people based upon their conservative viewpoints and posts in other conservative subs has nothing to do with it and is just coincidence to you. And I'm sure you're naive enough to think all of the PRO-CCP propaganda getting posted has nothing to do with a massive investment by the actual Communist Party of China. Jesus dude, you're less inquisitive than a toddler",StratTeleBender,2025-05-01T10:54:03,1
