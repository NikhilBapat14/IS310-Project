"*On Monday, a conservative federal judge shut down one of the most brazen attempts at election subversion in modern American history. In a scathing decision, U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers spurned Judge Jefferson Griffin’s bid to steal a North Carolina Supreme Court seat from Justice Allison Riggs, who narrowly won her race in November. Myers—a Donald Trump appointee and longtime member of the Federalist Society—**ruled that Griffin’s attempt to nullify thousands of lawful ballots violated North Carolinians’ constitutional rights, contravening “rudimentary requirements of equal treatment and fundamental fairness.”**  He ordered the state to certify Riggs’ victory, shutting down Griffin’s attempted theft of her seat.*   How anyone would be able to trust a decision by Judge Jefferson Griffin’ going forward is beyond me.",citizenjones,2025-05-06T14:56:15,449
