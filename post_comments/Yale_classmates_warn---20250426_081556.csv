"Lead Lines:   A group of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s classmates at Yale University urged him in a new letter to reconsider his role “in facilitating the Trump administration’s intended transformation” of the United States “into an authoritarian state.”  “Scott, please take a moment to step back, look down the road a piece, and think hard about whether you want to be responsible for enabling the descent of America into fascism,” says the letter, which is dated Wednesday.  “Be brave. Stand up for what you know to be right and be a voice of reason in the midst of this insanity,” the letter says.  It argues that “so many” of the actions of President Donald Trump and his second administration are unconstitutional and undermine the principles of democracy.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-26T08:16:16,68

I feel like Trump would take that as a compliment that he picked the right man for the job.,louisianapelican,2025-04-26T08:59:07,18

Their names will be right there, as part of an extraordinarily group of evil people who destroyed American democracy and helped to install fascism in the United States. They're going to be written about the same way history books have covered the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. This is the legacy that they will die with. I wonder if any of these people ever think of their kids or any grandkids who will ultimately have to carry that legacy and will *forever* be branded as the offspring of evil.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-26T12:31:43,6
We’ve seen how this plays out.  It’s not until the Empire is destroyed and the emperor dies that the dark lord unveils his last thread of humanity.,Christ_on_a_Crakker,2025-04-26T12:10:29,5

Are they more concerned about his reputation or Yale’s?  Having alums working for Trump is NOT something to be proud of.  https://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/6016-elis-in-the-trump-administration  First Trump disaster was worse  https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2018/03/26/yalies-abound-in-trump-administration/,bakeacake45,2025-04-26T11:36:35,4

"I am not standing up for the guy, but he seems one of the few in Trump's admin who is pushing back and calling for restraint here and there.  He also cut his teeth working for Soros, so there is that, which is odd that MAGA has been quiet on that front.    Anyways, rumors are that he is trying to leave his position and work at the Fed Reserve.",crucial_geek,2025-04-26T20:27:59,1
He calls them some people from 40 years ago. As if his Yale education was some random thing. Yeah an online letter is maybe not that significant but it is doing something!  What does “petition the government for redress of grievances” look like? I don’t know about courts but I say broadly it looks like this.,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-27T11:05:14,1

This is a 'career step' for Bessent. He can go back to the private sector with a beefed-up resume and demand higher compensation. It's a disgusting revolving door.,SEA2COLA,2025-04-26T10:04:09,13
