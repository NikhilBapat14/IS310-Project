What a dog shit head line.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-26T09:21:59,77
This is what an adult does.   Forgives their trespasses as I am sure the Pope forgave Trump's Trespasses.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T06:52:49,76
"I wonder if they just take a benign headline like “Trump pays respects to pope” and feed it into AI asking it to make it negative somehow.  “In curing cancer, Trump has put thousands of oncologists out of work. “",chillthrowaways,2025-04-26T14:25:20,6

It’s the best they could do trying to twist it practicing actual fascism.,MaglithOran,2025-04-26T22:05:42,6
"I dont think it is a sin to criticize someone politics, regardless of the situation. So i wouldn't use the language of forgiving trespasses here as that is biblical language regarding sin. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T09:34:11,46
"Im not sure about the last part, but that's hardly a concern anymore.",Czeslaw_Meyer,2025-04-26T12:36:35,4
No. It shows Trump has class and isn't an extremist.,whippingboy4eva,2025-04-26T09:41:29,5
It isn't just sin that you forgive. Is it a sin for example to cut someone off in a car?   There are plenty of trespasses that are not sins.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T09:42:19,5
"Well, the language of forgiving trespasses comes from the Our Father prayer and it says that God won't forgive our trespasses if we don't forgive those who trespasses against us.    Even if we say that doesn't only apply to sin, I don't think anyone will say that God won't forgive you if you don't ask for forgiveness for criticizing other people's political views. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T11:04:02,-3
Bro this one isn't that deep -- you're supposed to forgive those whom you feel have wronged you.,cplusequals,2025-04-26T12:01:57,3
"You can rationalize all you want about what Trespasses means.   That is your choice. If you want it to mean just sin. Then fine don't forgive people who do things that are not sins but give you reason to choose to be upset with them. Your choice to define it that way.  I feel that when I choose to let myself feel anger or be upset by someone, that I need to forgive them so I can learn to not get upset by similar actions by them or others.  After all, I can't make you upset or be angry, you choose to react that way all on your own.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T12:41:43,-2
"What Jesus teaches in Mathew 6:13 is that we ask God to ""forgive our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us.""    The text is a lot deeper than just don't hold a grudge as the focus of Mathew 6:13 is God's forgiveness. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T12:05:35,1
"Bro, I don't get why you are so heated. I think it is best that we stop talking as I dont think you are understanding what I'm saying and I dont understand what you are trying to say. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T13:28:49,2
"> 14 If you forgive others for the wrongs they have done, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  > 15 But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.  ""A lot deeper"" bro I can't. This is the kiddie pool of Bible verses. It's explicit and literal. There aren't layers of symbolism here. Just read it. Why you gotta fight everyone over nothing?",cplusequals,2025-04-26T12:22:17,0
Bro I don't understand why you make assumptions about me.  I am not heated. So please don't assume something not in evidence.  I am understanding completely what you are saying. I can understand something even though I don't agree with it.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T13:38:50,-1
"Forgive me, but i don't understand why you don't think this is saying anything about gods forgiveness. We must forgive for god to forgive us is literally in the texts that we both posted.    Maybe you've misunderstood what i am saying because you seem be reading the text in the same way as I am. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T12:24:50,-1
"The forgive me. I don't understand how you can believe the text doesn't say    But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions   It isnr just about not holding a grudge. It's about what we must do for god to forgive us. ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T13:43:10,2
You don't understand it because it makes no sense whatsoever. You made that stance up in your head.,cplusequals,2025-04-26T12:33:44,0
"And how was I not saying. Sorry if you cannot follow my statements but seem to be willing to assume I am ""heated"" for some reason.  I never said I don't forgive others. It is not easy, it is very hard to do depending on what you are trying to forgive.  I doubt I will ever forgive my Mother's Second husband, abuse is not easy to forgive even after 45 years. I hate the man and he is the only person in the world I actually hate.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T13:57:32,0
"It literally says it right here    >But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions   I'm not going to fight you about this though, so it is probably best that we part ways ",SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T13:26:11,-1
I'm not speaking about you as a person my dude. I'm responding to your criticism of what I believe ,SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T14:01:26,2
"No, you do not understand. Your impression of my position is completely divorced from reality. You cannot read.  >you don't think this is saying anything about gods forgiveness  This is not what I've said at any point. Go back through the thread. Slowly. Look at each word and try to understand what is being said.",cplusequals,2025-04-27T00:17:27,1
You said you don't believe in sin so how can you logically believe in repentance?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T14:02:37,1
I did not say I don't believe in sin. I said criticizing someone's political views is not a sin. ,SlavaAmericana,2025-04-26T14:03:15,1
"Apparently there are missing statements, I know I saw the words, I don't believe in sin, at one point. I am trying to find it. It was in the middle of one of your posts.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T14:22:44,1
