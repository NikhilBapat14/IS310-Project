I can see the pod with Theo Vonn red pilling a lot of youngsters. They grew up their whole lives being told that Trump was the most evil person to ever exist and then they see him have sincere and touching conversation with someone they like. I think a lot of people realized they've been lied to after all the podcast appearances.,Ed_Rock,2025-04-19T10:38:03,109
A lot of young men trended to the right during blm and covid. I suppose democrats constantly talking about abortion 24/7 didn't help either,agk927,2025-04-19T11:45:12,80
I am the “white guy” that the democrats have tried so hard to cast aside and villainize. Welcome to my retribution.,philthy069,2025-04-19T11:08:20,75
The left are spending Easter weekend rallying for a MS13 wife beater to be brought to the USA.  Keep it up because this is a losing issue.,tommythompson1976,2025-04-19T15:43:26,34
You can thank the liberal draconian lockdowns for COVID as why Gen Z turned red,Nectarine-Fast,2025-04-19T09:58:50,55
"I said this in another thread, but I’m not worried about the future of the Republicans vs Democrats in the not so distant future when the older generations die off. Gen Z men are going to save this country. If anything, the Democrats should be more worried about the older generations dying off. A lot (but not all) of the older conservatives are the neocon establishment types- the wing that McConnell, Murkowski, Cheney, Romney, and the Bush’s are all part of. The “new” Republicans of Trump, Vance, DeSantis, etc. are only going to get stronger, and it is clear that we won’t be going back to the neocon wing.",Trondkjo,2025-04-19T12:25:29,40

"I think it’s also a clear indication that the left has gone too far - left.   Youngsters are usually the most liberal, but even they are they the lefties gone whacky with social justice, wokeism shit, and the left has become so corrupt they’ve become complacent, and folks don’t like corruption, especially young people.    I think young folk would serve as a canary in a coal mine for the left and they’d realize they’re waaaay too far left, but instead they’re pushing the idea they need to go **further** left.  Which is just plain weird.",cliffotn,2025-04-19T15:19:59,40
"One of my Gen Z coworkers (25 years old) said before 2020 BLM and the whole woke era that followed, he was more moderate but still “leaned conservative.” But after the BLM movement and how the left was with gender and pronouns, he said he went “full blown conservative.” His parents are Vietnamese immigrants, so I’m sure they can see the dangers of the very things they escaped when they left Vietnam.",Trondkjo,2025-04-19T12:19:06,57
Im a millennial and this is what turned me from moderate to red. I didnt even care about politics really until all this shit started.,Jurclassic5,2025-04-19T16:13:06,15
And the prolonged masking and vaccine mandates.,Trondkjo,2025-04-19T11:42:21,22
Lol I think brigaders are stalking whatever I post and vote down as soon as I post. It happens in other subs as well that have nothing to do with politics.,Trondkjo,2025-04-19T13:45:39,26
"The Republican party has a strong bench of Gen-X talent, much more so than the Democrats.    Even when they have someone younger, like AOC, she's a sitting representative.  Only a single sitting representative has ever been elected President.  For a reason.",TedriccoJones,2025-04-20T05:41:19,4

"I remember watching the news coverage of destroyed city streets and hearing about people like David Dorn, murdered in cold blood , and being astonished that people actually did that, and more astonished that people I knew were defending it.   I remember being forced to sit in front of my computer for an entire day to take part in my school’s “racial equity day” where they had several speakers tell me that I had it better just because of the color of my skin.  I was only about 14 but it still sticks with me how crazy that era was.",Sit_Down_John,2025-04-19T16:49:51,10
