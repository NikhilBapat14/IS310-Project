"On 30 April 1945, Soviet troops were within five hundred metres of the Reich Chancellery. And even in these circumstances, nobody impeached Hitler or removed him from power, legally or illegally. The worst person to ever exist, the biggest loser to ever exist, the guy completely destroyed his country. A week before that he admitted to his closest allies that ""everything was lost"", while refusing to take any responsibility. His people stood by him till the end.

"These things are connected as well. They don't pay attention *because* their lives aren't really affected. Trans people, for example, are all paying attention because their lives are at risk. Not paying attention is a privilege only afforded to certain groups.   One of the hardest parts about the past 8 years is realizing how many Americans just don't care and wouldn't even pay attention if the government started persecuting entire minority groups.  It's also why I am honestly rooting for the tariffs to cause a major shock to the system. At this point it's the only thing that will wake these people up. They will only care when it starts affecting their wallet. They don't care about the trans or brown people being persecuted.",thedybbuk,2025-04-26T17:44:05,47
