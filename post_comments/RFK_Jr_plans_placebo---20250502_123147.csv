Yes have people pay for a placebo and potentially get polio.,TintedApostle,2025-05-02T12:32:24,15
"He is just trying to prevent the reach of necessary vaccines by creating delays based on incomplete assertions of facts.   >\[P\]ublic health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a [placebo](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html). In fact, all new immunizations already go through the trials - a type of random testing where one test group receives the immunization, and the other gets a placebo, like a saline shot.  >But newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process, because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group, and because the shot is only being tweaked in a minor way, vaccine experts said.  >The coronavirus shot, for example, already has gone through rigorous safety testing, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  >",PsychLegalMind,2025-05-02T12:36:06,12
Hi isn't this what a control group is during research and development ,PapasitoPenguin,2025-05-02T12:37:12,14
Let’s start with his kids.,BrutalHunny,2025-05-02T12:34:10,6
This happens in trials already.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-02T12:34:05,10
"In this case the placebo is the result of the study.   Looking to test the efficacy of made up trials against real ones, minus the real ones.  Odd they have to specify “new vaccines”.  It is already standard practice, but if any old vaccines didn’t have such studies, they shouldn’t be exempt.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-02T12:52:01,2
"Yes, previously vaccines didn't have control groups. This is what he's fixing.",alb5357,2025-05-02T12:38:48,-33
"In initial trials. This is even worse than being redundant, it's entirely illogical. The proposal is that every time an alteration is made, that it must undergo another double blind trial. So if you change the design of the delivery system, it needs a new trial. If you change the ratio of preservatives or other non-active ingredients to each other, it needs a new trial.  Things that don't modify the active ingredients in any way will require new trials as if this were a completely new drug.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-02T12:40:36,10
You’re wrong. Vaccine testing has always and still does use control groups. The control group just isn’t necessarily a placebo. That’s unneeded for vaccine improvements (such as the flu) where the previous years effective vaccine is used as the control for the current years.,DontHaveWares,2025-05-02T12:43:33,21
This is false. Initial trials have placebo control groups.,Dances-with-Worms,2025-05-02T12:43:23,13
"He is not going to ""fix"" anything. He's going to cause the health of US citizens to become worse, and costs will go up exponentially over the long term.",ResignedFate,2025-05-02T13:10:44,4
It's needed to know whether there are side effects.,alb5357,2025-05-02T12:50:30,-22
No one is questioning the need for control groups. We're pointing out that you falsely claimed vaccine trials have not had control groups in the past. They absolutely have had control groups.,Dances-with-Worms,2025-05-02T13:00:52,10
"So they actually didn't have placebo controls, as crazy as that sounds. And now the corporate media surprise is trying to frame introducing placebo controls as a bad thing.",alb5357,2025-05-02T13:10:36,-20
">So they actually didn't have placebo controls, as crazy as that sounds.  Initial trials have placebo controls.  Doubling down doesn't make a false statement true. It's ok to admit when you're wrong.",Dances-with-Worms,2025-05-02T13:15:26,11
"When there is no existing effective treatment, placebo versus experimental drugs are an excepted method.  If there is an existing relatively safe and effective drug A for disease X,  the standard clinical testing protocol is to use patients already taking A as the control group, and to administrate the new drug B to informed, consenting testing subjects.  To withhold an existing, effective drug from sick people, and give them placebos instead, is unethical malpractice.",BoneSpring,2025-05-02T13:37:03,10
You really don’t know why placebo controls aren’t used? Do we need to talk about Tuskegee?,anonMLMhater,2025-05-02T14:03:27,9
"Who would be in these sort of studies? Say there is an improved measles vaccine. Right now, it is tested against the existing measles vaccine. If you change that to testing against a shot of saline, who is allowing their kid to be in that trial?   Many drug trials are run the same way, because it is unethical to cause harm to the control group.",relyne,2025-05-02T14:06:07,7
Piece of advice for you: you should do some reading before you form opinions. : ),DontHaveWares,2025-05-03T01:15:13,2
