"I served with several trans people. I never had a problem with any of them. In fact, one of them was a super close friend of mine.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-28T12:16:06,21
They want to push out anyone with liberal values from serving in the military so it can be more easily controlled. It's what we're seeing from the top down in the military and all other government agencies.,HyperbolicLetdown,2025-04-28T12:37:21,17
My buddy served with quite a few trans folk in the navy and his only issue with them was hearing how many killed themselves due to harassment after he left the service.,gryanart,2025-04-28T13:23:51,15

We need a trans Memorial Day and a trans Veterans Day.  We can’t allow our trans brothers and sisters to be erased from history.,dbag3o1,2025-04-28T12:13:43,7
"Idk why people are so adamant to serve a country, people, and military that clearly hate them so much.  Like babes, they’re your enemy, they have said so. Don’t help them with anything",slowfadeoflove0,2025-04-28T12:16:28,3
"Piss off Fetterman. Asshat.  I'm cool with Duckworth. She kicks ass, even without legs.",DarthHiccups,2025-04-28T16:52:20,1

"As a POC who served, serving can feel like a real privilege/honor. I wish more people could experience it. Not everyone in the country is an asshole, and even those who are still assholes are still Americans at the end of the day. After serving, I look at everyday folks on the street a bit differently now.  I give a little more grace than I used to. Don't get me wrong, it's a slap in the face when some people don't see you as a ""real American"" simply based off of what I look like, despite serving for half a decade and having ancestors that have been here for centuries.   It can also open so many doors (GI Bill, professional experience, world travel at a young age, a way to get out of a shitty hometown, etc.).",my_Urban_Sombrero,2025-04-28T12:29:45,7

"Honestly, my life would have benefited from some kind of structure in my early twenties, and that has made me think a year or two of conscription for youngins might do us some good",lingbabana,2025-04-28T19:46:50,2
"I don’t disagree there. The whole experience did turn me onto the idea of a robust welfare state, though.  Like I entered the service as an enlightened centrist and came out a militant leftist lol.",my_Urban_Sombrero,2025-04-28T12:55:56,8
"That, or join a domestic version of the Peace Corps (think a vastly expanded AmeriCorps).  And rich kids can’t get a deferment.",my_Urban_Sombrero,2025-04-28T20:29:05,2
That's interesting!  I would have thought things tended toward the other direction for people.,Elseiver,2025-04-28T19:12:53,1
"There was a certain peace of mind given by a guaranteed roof over my head, healthcare, and never worrying about where my next meal came from that I do miss. In my free time I pursued hobbies, took some online classes (finished my B.A.!), saved up for fun things (a wedding/honeymoon). It was a vibe, but I didn't want to make it a career.   Now I'm in grad school and house poor, but thriving otherwise!",my_Urban_Sombrero,2025-04-28T19:19:59,1
