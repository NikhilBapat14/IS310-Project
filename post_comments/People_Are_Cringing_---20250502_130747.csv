"Vance is right.  he’s definitely doing everything he said they would. The desegregation orders being put in right now in the mid west, a part of 2025 that was written and laid out to do so. Everything was in those plans. Deportation, “no tax on tip and overtime” (look at that plan in project 2025 bc it’s laughable) the take down of govt agencies, fema, park rangers and national parks in general. No one believed he would actually do any of this. & he straight lied to everyone saying he had nothing to do with it. Most dems saw through that. So When people (conservatives) say well I didn’t vote for this, honey you did.",Tiny-Western9010,2025-05-02T13:13:45,9
The obviously fake praise tells me that Trump is not worthy of any truthful praise from the people close to him. Whatever Trump is hoping to show America is coming across exactly opposite.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-02T13:34:03,3

"**From reporter Kimberley Richards:**  Many people have criticized the dynamic of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet meetings, which have entailed members of the Trump administration heaping praise on the president with glowing tributes celebrating his second term in office.  During his Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, which focused on the president’s first 100 days in office, Trump was showered with compliments while he and members of the administration touted successes in his second term, which has been riddled with chaos and uncertainty. At one point, Vice President JD Vance referenced the portraits displayed in the Oval Office, saying that “most” of the presidents featured in the portraits have acted as “placeholders” instead of “men of action.”  “The reason the media attacks this administration as chaotic is because the president is solving the problems the American people set about to solve,” Vance said. “He’s actually doing the things that he promised he would do, and Mr. President, it’s been an honor to be a part of it for the past 100 days.”  Attorney General Pam Bondi followed Vance by addressing the president directly to say that his “first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country — ever.”     Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cabinet-meetings-workplace-experts\_l\_6813b2bde4b02f012970d330?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-cabinet-meetings-workplace-experts_l_6813b2bde4b02f012970d330?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-02T13:10:18,2

"The best part is Bondi later going on to claim that the DEA and FBI have seized enough fentanyl to kill 258 million people, therefore the President has saved 258 million lives.  The utter stupidity to even make that claim is astounding, let alone the sycophantic need to do it to Trump's face in front of a crowd.",o8Stu,2025-05-02T13:31:23,6
