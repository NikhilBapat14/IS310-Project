"They ain't seen nothin' yet. Wait until Memorial Day and shelves and stock rooms are empty. It's going to make the supply chain disruptions from Covid look like a minor inconvenience.

I saw the number of people who are worried about being laid off at their job -- it usually ticks between 20% in good times and 40% in bad times (for example at the height of the Biden inflation and tech layoffs).  It was at 70% which is near record levels. It hasn't been close to that since the height of the 2008 recession. That's just not politically sustainable.,rage_panda_84,2025-04-28T18:46:25,241

Nearly 90 million Americans didn't vote at all. And if we had elections tomorrow, the vast majority of people would vote *exactly* as they did in November.  Why?  Because they don't know any better. *Most* people don't know their right hand from their left. *Most* people believe, without proof or any evidence, whatever they are told. *Most* people will only listen to what they agree with. *Most* people do not know how to think critically. *Most* people have the judgement of a hormonal teenager.

Reddit is terrible at that, the boston bomber event is about the most precise example one could give of people locking on to fake, but plausible explanations to remove that uncertainty - Some 'sluths' provided an explanation and people latched onto it, very much the same people who will decry fake news and say they can't be duped by it.

">No, it wasn't.  The US economy *was* doing better than any other economy in the world. It had the among the easiest recoveries from the Covid Pandemic, and was still the largest and most powerful economy in the world by a large margin.  >An economy which doesn't benefit larger portions of a population certainly is nothing to be envied.  Then no country in existence has an economy worth celebrating. Which a lot of accelerationists and revolutionaries would certainly agree with you on. It's fair to criticize the USA on wealth inequality, but acting like that isn't an even larger problem in other parts of the world is working with blinders on.  >The idea of US exceptionalism has to die.  I agree with you that US exceptionalism needs to die - it's a widely debunked myth. The problem here is that you're not describing US exceptionalism. At most, you could say that comments hyping up the US economy are nationalistic in nature, which every nation suffers from in various degrees. But the US *does* have the strongest economy, much like it has the strongest military, so trying to deny that is often the result of nationalist bias itself.  US exceptionalism is the idea that Americans are *just better* and more capable than the rest of the world because of the unique circumstances that Americans operate in. Ironically, the idea was coined by a French writer, Alexis de Tocqueville, after his travels to America and observations of life there in the 1830s.  To quote Tocqueville:  >The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one. Their strictly Puritanical origin, their exclusively commercial habits, even the country they inhabit, which seems to focus their minds on the pursuit of science, literature, and the arts, the proximity of Europe, which allows them to sometimes neglect these pursuits without relapsing into barbarism, a thousand special causes, of which I have only been able to point out the most important, have singularly concurred to fix the mind of the American upon purely practical objects.  This idea of the rugged frontier and harsh climate shaping Americans into a more practical, more independent sort of people - while building upon the artistic and religious foundations of their European forebears - is the basis for US Exceptionalism, even as it continues down to today, with many Americans raised to believe in this view of cultural superiority leading to American success, despite it having little real basis.  American hegemony has a lot more to do with geography, imo - how the USA became naturally shielded by two oceans once it conquered the mainland, and how that conquest of the natives over great distances caused it to master logistics and engineering to a degree that other nations simply had not.",Axelrad77,2025-04-29T06:23:33,1

Yes, a truly strong economy should be good for the working class; the lack of that environment largely led us to this political and economic moment.
