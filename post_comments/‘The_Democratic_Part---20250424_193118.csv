The Democratic Party needs to embrace some new blood. Trying to cater to the centrists and Republican-lites has been an absolute failure.,theRAV,2025-04-24T19:46:23,55

"The DNC is having trouble between the corporate wing and the progressive worker wing.  The progressive wing brings the activism, street canvassing, visibility, and helps voters to the booth.  Unfortunately, the large donors on the corporate side bring in 80% of the funds.

"shocked he didnt flip over to the GOP  i agree florida dems are awful, i just find it funny that these cowards who actually have the ability to fight back- choose to quit, and blame it on the people. Pizzo is making the selfish decision here, and trying to frame it like has no choice bc of the party.   Its dead, and youre part of the reason why its dead.   i would not be shocked to see Nikki Fried do something like this by 2028 if things dont turn around.

Assuming he does, he'll peter out in most cases, but by that point there will likely literally be three people who at least used Democrats in the race (John Morgan is also likely running, although he'll pull about equally-also, the funny is, the likely Democratic nominee is also a longtime ex-Republican), so a Republican win is even more likely.",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-25T15:13:53,1

"Many picked Trump because he's a hate monger. He's a racist, a sexist, and hates LGBT. And he's given the far right cover to hate freely like they have always had.  He won some of the middle because they liked what he had to say. But they made the mistake of trusting a man that couldnt explain how he would do any of the things he said. He sold a dream of bringing back 1960 and all these fantastic high-paying manufacturing jobs where a household can survive again on a single income and still buy a house, a car, a puppy, and a large family with the wife staying at home. That's the America dream they think they want to return to. But it's an America that isn't possible anymore.     Not those voters are going to learn a very difficult and hard lesson.",InsideAside885,2025-04-24T20:48:01,7
"IMO, If you have to choose between a Republican and a Republican-lite, you're going to choose the real deal most the time. People want a strong contrast between candidates, and they want Democrats to fight for something besides the status quo. It's true that in a great many districts being further left is a detriment. In a great many others just putting a passionate, confident, competent person in the race would greatly improve the chances of victory even if they were fairly far left.",Cdub7791,2025-04-25T03:31:26,3
Trump got fewer votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The difference was that the Democrats weren't able to get people to turn out in 2024.,theRAV,2025-04-24T20:33:13,9
"That’s not very nuanced. It could be argued that they swung anti establishment  and established norms were set out with bipartisan consensus. If bipartisanship, which relies on compromise was so appealing why did the no compromises candidate win?",Mental_Priority_7083,2025-04-24T20:30:03,1

"But *will* they learn that lesson? Or will they blame Democrats and move on. So far, there are a number of polls that show Trump losing support on certain issues, yes, but a lot of polls seem to suggest that no one is regretting their vote....or *not* showing up. That doesn't scream confidence.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:55:09,2
">Trump got fewer votes in 2024 than he did in 2020. The difference was that the Democrats weren't able to get people to turn out in 2024.  Check your math.   Trump got 74,223,975 votes in 2020.  He got 77,302,580 in 2024.   Admittedly, he probably would have still lost if Biden's 2020 voters had all shown up, but ultimately he gained over 3 million voters from 2020 to 2024.",TheBigLeMattSki,2025-04-24T20:54:58,6
"That's the story of virtually every American election for the last several decades; when Democrats show up, they win.

"It's a hard reach to argue that Trump is ""anti-establishment."" He's a former president. They picked him because they liked what he did before. That's not anti-establishment, that's an express preference for brutalizing immigrants, limiting the rights of women, and punishing civil servants.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:39:03,1

"> Yeah, I'm sure that not allowing a primary,  there was a primary.  Biden won it.  Each state has it's own primary rules - there is literally NO WAY to do a 50 state primary 3 months before the general election.    The way it works is that you have a contested convention.  Abe Lincoln was no one's first choice, he didn't secure the nomination until the THIRD round of voting.  The Dems didn't have a contested convention because, with only 3 months until the general, the competition decided it was likely to crash and burn so they endorsed Harris instead of trying to run themselves.",m0nk_3y_gw,2025-04-24T21:03:51,3
"Actually, probably not. Because the operative ""disconnect"" is on ""unpopular predecessor."" There was literally nothing Biden could do that would have gotten progressives to turn out. Biden's public approval dipped after he withdrew from Afghanistan and never, ever recovered regardless of passing historic legislation in both its scale and pattern-breaking frequency, regardless of navigating a once-in-a-century pandemic, and rallying NATO to Ukraine's defense.   Policy does not matter to the American people. Only ""vibes"" and the vibe right now...is Trump. That's what the American people want. Hate and chaos is what they want.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-24T20:50:03,6
