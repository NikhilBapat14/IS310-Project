"Original [Times Article](https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/ex-cia-chief-we-gave-ukraine-enough-weapons-to-bleed-not-to-win-r3q0r2fcg) may be behind a paywall for you. Sorry. There are other sources, mostly Ukranian so I wanted to link to a conservative and and independent source.   This has been long suspected - that Biden's strategy was an indefinite stalmate, of course increasing the long term risk that problems build up and build up instead of stopping the Russian threat whilst it was still confined near to Russia where the risk of Nuclear use is lower and more likely to damage Russia rather than triggering a NATO nuclear response.",nar_tapio_00,2025-05-05T16:00:25,8
"Yep, this has been my biggest issue with Biden’s foreign/Ukraine policy for years. He seems to be happy to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of lives, all in the name of tying up Russia. Russia should have been pushed back (or at least to the table) a long time ago. Instead Biden seemed to intentionally let both countries suffer. FJB  Trump, for all his cons in this area, seems to at least want to end the conflict. Like him or hate him, that policy will save lives.",iowaisflat,2025-05-06T09:41:43,1

I would not say indefinite stalemate I would say keep shoveling money to his buddies with no end game in sight because he owed them (how many Hunter Dad speaker phone conversations were recorded on the Ukrainian side) … leave the mess and Kamala would have kept calling for 100s of billions … how the peace party became the war mongers … oh yah money ….,Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-05T17:44:45,1
"That may be, but Sullivan and the rest of the security council were fully conscious as they allowed war to go on whilst blocking Ukraine from attacking Russia's factories and oil refinaries. That's exactly the opposite of what's needed. Force Russia to stop through ecomomic damage, both military and sanctions.  Russia's nuclear forces may be quite broken right now, but they are still dangerous and if they get money from exports and sanctions lifting, they will be able to afford to finance their rebuilding programs.",nar_tapio_00,2025-05-05T16:17:31,7
