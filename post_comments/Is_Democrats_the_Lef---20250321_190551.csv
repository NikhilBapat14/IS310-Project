"There's one consistent thing in Politics that has been true my entire life and I can remember this from being involved in the Iraq war protests. The left has to answer and is responsible for any one singular action taken by anyone in the party. I remember a campus protest in ugh, I think it was Cal State where one, one person protested near an ROTC training.      Anyway all the sudden we were against the troops, which wasn't the argument on our campus. We didn't want to see the troops die in what we thought was a terrible war - we wanted to save American lives. Didn't matter, we had to go in front of Admin to explain this one persons actions - not even in our own state!

"We have been overtaken by fascist oligarchs.   Tesla is Elons baby.   Obviously it is becoming a liability to drive one for a multitude of reasons but the vandalism is certainly not making it more desirable to own one. This is hurting its stock, which is the only power people have.  The question is more so, why are people surprised that an unelected South African oligarch throwing Nazi salutes at the White House is receiving backlash?   Why are people surprised that an unelected South African oligarch using his money to influence the government is receiving backlash?  All this being said - pinning this on the left is just more fascistic use of executive authority to instill fear in the population. The left has nothing to do with this.

The only people who deserve blame for Teslas being torched are the people torching the Teslas and anyone who told them to do so.  Who are you saying told them to do so?  No leftist politician I am aware of told anyone to torch a Tesla.

"It’s certainly not the “right” torching Teslas. Musk and the Tesla were very popular with the left. Once upon a time if the left had had their way, they’d have gotten rid of all gasoline cars and made everyone buy all electric cars.  The left doesn’t even truly believe that Musk is a fascist or that he made a Nazi salute.  The hate is a result of their perception that someone they thought was at least a liberal, is supporting President Trump.  Objectively speaking, the Tesla is a great car.

The Democrats are not on the left. The left and the Democrats are two different groups. There are many of us who are on the left who wish the Democrats would adopt left or progressive positions but they're too far to the right and two addicted to corporate donations to do so.    So your premise is wrong. I am not aware that the Democrats have any connection to activandalism against Tesla or its dealers and car owners.    As far as whether it's hurtful politically the question is hurtful to whom? Since there is no political party advocating vandalism against Tesla it's difficult to see why there would be a political price. Of course I'm not going to try to justify vandalism against Tesla but I can certainly understand why people feel the need for it and it wouldn't surprise me if it dissuaded people from buying Tesla cars.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-03-24T00:04:07,1

"It's sick. The democrats are the party of hate,. Their protests are hateful, their speech is hateful, they are just hateful people. No surprises there really though.   They are fine with mass protests that destroy and burn property,  then call them peaceful. They want to let rapists and child molesters free to roam our streets because the don't want to turn them over to ICE. They try to keep dangerous gang members in our country and prioritize them over Americans. They kill babies, they keep racism alive and well because it's all about making black people victims and nit empowering them. Their districts are so over run with drugs and prostitution that companies flee those cities. And if that doesn't run them out the theft does.

How does ANYONE condone that. It's disgusting and it's ALL THE TRUTH. Everyone yells about Trump , but take a good hard look at this country and take a long hard look at blue cities and tell me I'm wrong. At least Trump is trying to fix it.

"“ Terrorism, in its broadest sense, is the use of violence against non-combatants to achieve political or ideological aims. The term is used in this regard primarily to refer to intentional violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants.”  Yes, terrorism is a separate category of violent crime, one that is defined by the aim of achieving political or ideological goals. Violent crimes such as mass shootings, gang shootings, and other violent crimes are by definition different as the motive and intent behind the crime is very different. So violence with an aim of political change is by definition terrorism.   There is nothing dishonest about that. Just as there is nothing dishonest about there being a difference between an individual killing another in defense of themselves and an individual killing another to take their property.   Whether or not an individual is a victim of something is not determined by that individual’s political affiliation(s). ",Colodanman357,2025-03-22T16:43:08,0

Nobody is waiting for the CEO of the left or right to give their official endorsement of something. That's just silly.  In this case, the people who are advocating against Elon are largely people who hold left wing views. The people who vandalizing Teslas want to send a message that Elon is not well liked and they want to coerce society into avoiding his companies, and thus weakening his power and influence on politics.

">You came here to point out that the sky is blue and water is wet?  I came to make a very important distinction. Many hold the belief that unless a politician says or does something then it isnt real and has no impact on politics. In reality it is very impactful. Politics is downstream from culture, so while the politicians may not be pushing it the fact is its still part of the democrat package, as the left leaning people are who the politicians represent.",cferg296,2025-03-21T19:55:32,-1
">The kid was a young Republican  Registered republican does not mean he leaned right. That is a huge misconception about the political parties. Democrat does not mean left and republican does not mean right. While it isnt common ive met conservative democrats and liberal republicans. Another huge misconception is that someone is meant to have group loyalty to political leaders (conservatives dont automatically have to follow a republican politician nor do liberals have to follow a democrat politician). Your side is framing the shooter as a trump supporter who felt ""betrayed"" by trump and took a shot to get revenge, but there is literally 0 evidence of that.  >People who don't do that fall into the crazy bucket and aren't promoting left ideology- it is against everything the left stands for.  I was left leaning for most of my life before i moved to the right. And the one thing i learned is that the left are far more crazy than the right is overall. The difference is that the left tends to have an unearned sense of moral superiority, so they dont classify their own craziness as crazy, nor their own incivility as incivility. This is why the ""paradox"" of tolerance is such a dangerous and flawed mentality.

I grouped people together with the statement of actione of individuals contribute to optics of the sides of the cultural aisle, but i do NOT assign group blame and never did.   >Did the Right try to overthrow the transfer of power on Jan 6?   No they did not. A small group of radicals broke into the capital, but im not going to say that the right as a whole can be blamed for it. Same with how i dont say the left as a whole can be blamed for the bombings. HOWEVER the optics of both sides will be affected regardless of the fact most of either side are blameless. Truth doesnt sway people in elections, nor does it attract people on a cultural level. Only optics does.  >If you can lump all the Left together you can lump all the Right together.

"I don't necessarily disagree with your opinion that these anti-Elon efforts have nuance to them. However, by the same token, we have to also acknowledge that the context of the anti-Elon movement abroad is different from the one inside the country. The anti-Elon movement across the rest of the West is done in response to Trump destroying our alliances for no reason.   Elon is seen as a symbol of the American oligarchy who is trying to undermine their nations by supporting their far right moments while at the same time influencing Trump to continue to destroy these respective countries most strategic alliance, the US alliance. To them Elon is simply a national threat, and therefore, all the political factions, except for the far right, want to purge his influence from their lands.  Domestically, it's a bit different. Elon has been adopted by MAGA, and is thus a part of our right wing. While you are correct in assessing that there are more people than just just left wing leaning people who are against Elon, Trump, MAGA, and their brand of fascism, that doesn't change the fact that majority of people who are against them are left wing. The people boycotting, protesting, and vandalizing Tesla and Twitter are overwhelmingly a part of the Democratic coalition, they're a part of the American left.   There may be other people involved, but the movement is still a left wing one. It is motivated by left leaning political goals, it is organized in left wing circles, it's participants are largely left leaning, and the general public perceives it as left wing movement. Calling this movement left wing is just stating what it is.",AVeryBadMon,2025-03-21T23:06:56,2

"No party is a monolith- people do sometimes forget that for conservatives because the left is a patchwork quilt of a zillion ideologies, and the right can sometimes seem like they're all coming from the same place and have the same values. But it's always a mistake to assume anything about any group of people, and I'd hate to paint half the country as people who were happy to see what happened on Jan 6th.  We can disagree with the details, but anyone who can't condemn violence or destruction outright no matter who is it against is someone who isn't thinking for themselves in my opinion- they're crazy cultists. That goes for anyone on either side.   I also very much respect the J6s who have come out and said they were wrong to go along with it that day. I can understand getting caught up in crowds and the momentum of what is happening around you and regretting it later. The ones that don't regret it scare me because - again - it's crazy behavior. I live in downtown Minneapolis- I really disliked the George Floyd riots destruction at the time and condemned it.   Living here I know it wasn't as it was painted to be, I saw months of protests and so many were peaceful, and 3 days of destruction - which was terrible.  I've said many times that those who were in DC for a peaceful protests but didn't go to the capital are not the same.

">That last sentence is core hateful ideology  Except it isnt. That is the main criticism against the paradox of tolerance.

The left is very anti-gun. As for violence it depends on the time period, as the actions and mentality of the sides change over time. Though at the moment they are the more likely side to commit violence. Left wing activism spawns car bombings, dealership arsen, property damage and looting during race riots, destroying art in the name of climate activism, and traffic blocking (the last one i admit i am loose on the word violence). The only real right wing violence you can point to in recent memory is jan 6th. Its not really comparable.   >Of the two of us, one has painted a whole party of people as the same - and it definitely isn't me.  I did not. In fact multiple times in this thread i have said i do NOT assume group blame, doesnt matter if its the left or the right. The only people to be blamed for an act of violence are the people who committed the violence, no one else.

"Only Jan 6th?  Nice rewriting of history... The Capitol attack was not an isolated incident. In recent years, Domestic Violent Extremists (DVEs) have committed numerous hate crimes and acts of political violence, including mass shootings targeting Charleston’s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue, and several other houses of worship; the 2019 mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas; the mass shooting at the 2017 congressional baseball game; the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia; shootings by Kyle Rittenhouse and Michael Reinoehl last summer; and the disrupted plots to kidnap Governors Gretchen Whitmer and Ralph Northam.   Although these attacks involved DVEs across the ideological spectrum, both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have assessed that violent white supremacists represent the most significant domestic terrorism threat.[4] Nonpartisan experts likewise warn that violent white supremacists, and right-wing extremists more broadly, pose a particularly acute domestic terrorism threat.""  This was Chrisopther Wray's (a Repub and Trump appointee, even though he wasn't extreme enough for him during round 2) FBI saying that right-wing extremists are the new biggest terrorist threat.  This is violence against people - this is something continually down played to the political right by politicians because it is inconvenient.   I would never say that those people all represented everyone on the right - I strongly believe the vast majority of people are good and decent people - and extremists are obviously not people who are acting in good faith. Pretending the crazy people have some justification to their actions is unacceptable on both sides. But so is pretending one side is ""the good ones""while the other is all the crazy trouble makers.  Are some people targeting Teslas on the ""left""? Yes I'm sure they think they are - but that doesn't mean they are the left - it means they're criminals who have their own beliefs and are lone perpetrators causing harm.  I also have no doubt that not all are on the ""left"" - some are people who just want to destroy and see an opportunity, some want to agitate, and there are probably even more motivations we can't even conceive of yet - partly because we're not crazy so can't follow their nutty logic.  That's kind of the point. If you're on the left legitimately you know this does no good, as I'd hope you would say about Jan 6th for the right.",WeakRelation1,2025-03-22T12:33:54,2
