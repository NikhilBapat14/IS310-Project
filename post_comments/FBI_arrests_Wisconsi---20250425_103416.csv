"Leftists are worried that illegal alien criminals won't show up to court if they're afraid of getting arrested by ICE. Maybe don't let them bond out if youre worried that they won't show up for court? Bonds are usually reserved for individuals that the Court is sure will return to face justice. Keep them in custody, proceed with their case, honor any ICE detainers when the trial is over.   The current system to to just release them in their own recognizance and hope that they show up to court. The Court will issue a failure to appear warrant if the defendant doesn't show up, but that warrant might not have nationwide extradition, so the accused can just go live in a different state with very little repercussions.Â ",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-25T17:32:55,3
