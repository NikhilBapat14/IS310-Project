"> Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.  > No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.  So basically another Trump nothingburger",gradientz,2025-05-09T05:34:17,15
So let me get this straight… the national emergency tariffs on auto and steel and aluminum dropped to zero… how is it a national emergency then?   Also hurts car manufacturers in America who are paying 25% tariffs on USMCA parts while UK tariffs max out at 10%,chunkyfunky,2025-05-09T04:17:05,12
"By all accounts this the timing of this was a surprise to the British side (I can't imagine Starmer deliberately scheduling a call in the second half of a crucial Arsenal match), so maybe Trump is desperate for something to pull out of the bag. There's certainly a *lot* of areas still outstanding, pharmaceuticals for one.    We still have the state visit in the diary, so maybe our strategy here is to say ""We, the UK, will provide a theatrical stage and enough diplomatic special effects to make your incoherent trade policy screenplay look like a tentpole blockbuster. Just keep dripping in the concessions and we'll start work on the sequel"". ",Spiracle,2025-05-09T05:37:22,3
"So the deal was to lower tariffs for foreign countries and keep them high for Americans? Truly the greatest president of our lifetime. Not even 4d chess at this point, pure 6d.",ParappaTheWrapperr,2025-05-09T05:05:33,4

"So, Brits are going to import US beef because we have plenty? Then why is hamburg $5/pound and steaks $20/lb?   And if I recall, Britain banned our beef because most US beef goes to slaughter before age 2, and BSE does not typically manifest symptoms in beef until after that age.   There is a reason most developed countries don't want to import food grown in  the US=plenty of chemicals (pesticides, etc) are banned in other countries for use in food products, so it is not really fair to expect your country to follow rules and then import product from a country where they don't have to follow those rules.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-05-09T07:20:15,1
"That's good news for the auto and metal industries. Hopefully, this will make cars and other goods a bit cheaper for consumers too.",ModernnMuse,2025-05-09T06:14:36,-2
"Oh, Trump is very desperate for a win. He didn’t end the war in Ukraine, the Iran nuclear talks seem to be going nowhere, his tax cuts haven’t been passed yet, people are getting upset with DOGE cuts, and all of the groveling and begging he was expecting from other countries is not happening. Instead he is begging China to come to talks. Cause in point, the talks they are having with china in Switzerland is because China was going to be there already for an Europe economic conference. America literally had to beg China to have a meeting with them during the conference.",D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-09T05:53:00,5
">so maybe Trump is desperate for something to pull out of the bag.   Not maybe, definitely. He announced 90 deals in 90 days, and told reporters to stop asking questions about it. He figured maybe this would shut reporters up by announcing this ""deal""...which of course isn't a deal because nothing is signed.",css555,2025-05-09T05:48:57,3
"No Brit wants American food anyway, so no real downside for us. Gives the steel industry a lifeline at a critical time (at least until the orange guy changes his mind again, so probably Monday)",skitarii_riot,2025-05-09T09:57:29,1
