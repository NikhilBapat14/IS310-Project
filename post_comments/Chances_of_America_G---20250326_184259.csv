"Not necessarily a war but I could see widespread domestic attacks becoming more common in the US during this administration. Less American Civil War, more The Troubles. We're already seeing it with the Tesla situation. Now imagine how much more angry people will get when the economy gets worse, when people start losing jobs and social security, etc. I would expect higher instances of conflict in the summer months due to the heat making people more irritable.",TemporaryRiver1,2025-03-27T07:24:58,273

"Your post is flawed, and missing the elephant in the Room.  The US could very well find itself at war with a Canadian/UK/European Alliance before any other conflict.  The threats have crossed a rubicon and said Alliance, with obtuse help from China, could very easily buckle the US at the knees.  You don't need aircraft carriers to win a war, and modern warfare has many faces.  It's extraordinary that most Americans have literally no idea how serious things have become between the US and the New Alliance. Already, here in Europe, individual countries are preparing our citizens for war. There have been US travel warnings from multiple countries this week alone.

China attempts to take taiwan.  Iran-Israel turns into a full blown war.  Whats scary is the possibility the US is not prepared for China.  We have lost the technological edge that defined US hegemony for the last 70 years and we arent going to get it back.  However i think Trump would abandon taiwan to china.  We might see a larger war in Europe, and the US may not side with European allies.  Trump and Vance have this incredible hate for Europe that blows my mind.

"Israel is a genocidal state trying to drag the US into a war with Iran. If that happens, Russia would probably try to annex Ukraine and China would probably try to annex Taiwan.   While US politicians have been bribed into backing Israel, the problem is that military aged Americans overwhelmingly support Palestine. Furthermore, many Americans hate Trump far more than they hate any foreign leader. It’s likely that Trump will try to use some flimsy excuse to garner support for a war, but the cynical reality is that Americans would rather peacefully or even violently fight him than go to war for him.   It’s not just a bunch of Reddit progressives that hate him. His mandate is minuscule. If he thinks billionaire CEOs support him because of his leadership rather than his tax cuts, he’s sorely mistaken. If he does anything to seriously hurt the US economy like starting a war, he’s getting thrown under the bus immediately.   Furthermore, a large chunk of libertarian MAGA types are going to be very angry if he starts another Afghanistan or Iraq style war. And forget starting. Even just responding to an enemy is a stretch. The simple fact is that everyone in America remembers that while 9/11 was horrible, the military response was even worse.  Trump wants to be a wartime president, but he’s far more likely to oversee a civil war than a foreign one.",McKoijion,2025-03-27T17:38:41,5

"Great discussion we are having here.   I'm no scholar nor am I as studied up as most of the accounts replying (or AI enough :)).  88% of the conflicts we are involved in and will be involved in under Trump will be regarding resources.   Elon has brought Trump onto the Mars settlement dream and if you remember Trump has even said ""our future is with our space programs"".  What is the main thing needed to even think about accomplishing this feat????  RESOURCES.   We are bullying these countries for either there resources or the routes that we will need to get these resources.     Why do you think Elon meets at the Pentagon frequently??  To look at other nations and map out strategic plans to extract there resources.  Ukraine wanted no part nor did Greenland.   Who's next in line.  I'm telling you we will 100%  either be going to war in order to force those resources or start a conflict to get to these resources.   The bigger picture is being missed here.   This isn't about human rights, loyalty to other nations or pedophile lists...  This is about resources.   In DTs eyes he is convinced that if we have the resources then we will be able to build what we need to in order to beat China to the next step in humans evolving.  So yes, we will be going to war because no country is going to just hand over there mineral rights because there's a new dad in town.   When you voted...

No war will begin full scale like WW1 did again. It starts small and only grows through neglecting or ignoring the signs and small attacks. Smash those attempts and guess what, no war.

"Does anyone remember when Ukraine was invaded by Russia?  Russia was hated for good reason. But soon it would spill-over to the Russian people: it wasn't just the government that was hated, but all Russians. It didn't matter if the Russians in question were people who had fled Russia or not: the only thing that mattered was that Russia and all of its people were complicit.  The idea was largely that it was the fault of the Russian people for allowing it to progress that far; that it was cowardly of its people to not hold order in their house. I remember having a multitude of conversations almost every day for a few months after the war started with people from around the world.  Some conversations had a lot of nuance while others had none. There were for example a zero tolerance to anyone leaving Russia - often angering us Westerners that they would rather leave than protest against the government - and when banks in the West started shutting down payment and credit services for Russian cardholders, everyone thought it was a great idea: maybe this would force the Russian people to deal with their government.  I had this kind of conversation a lot with Americans in particular, and I remember being downvoted for suggesting that locking down credit card functions for Russians \*only\* hurt Russians outside of Russia who we should see as allies and not enemies, because they already have decided to uproot their whole life on the premise of not wanting to fight for the Russian nation. I even received death threats and other insanity over my inbox.  Ironically, I had many conversations with people from the US where I tried to tell them, imagine if it was you? And they all boasted and promised what they would do if it were them. That they would not be sheep, and simply sit at home, and let someone like Putin take over power.  It's ironic because here we are, with the US upending almost a century of world order and attacking allies left and right economically, while cozying up to the very same crazy dictator that these same people said ""must be fought at every cost""; an US where the executive branch has seized full control of Congress, the judicial branches, and even of the military. An US headed by a leader who has set taxes to around 17% for billionaires while raising the taxes for middle-class workers to unprecedented levels, an US where a literal criminal sits as president but through his own machinations made himself immune to prosecution.  Where are these people who promised if it were them they would stand up? Where are the amendment nutjobs? Where are the good people of the US who promised that they would never stand by evil?  The US is probably the largest ironical tragedy of all modern history. And I have yet to find a more hypocritical people who so loudly talk about freedom, yet consistently accept whatever draconian measures are tossed out at them. I find it pathetic that the same people who bashed Russians for inaction now sit in silence watching their own country go into flames.  If the Russian people could be held absolutely accountable for what was going on in the government - an idea most welcomed by Americans at the time - then it stands to reason that the US people are also held accountable for what's going on in their government. But I would probably be safe to assume that many Americans feel that this isn't fair, correct? Rules for thee but not for me.  American hubris had reached an all-time high, and the deafening silence of their fall since is a most untimely facet of perspectives on USA.  To be clear, I feel for the American people. Just like I felt for the Russian people who were sent to the meat grinder without a say so, I feel for Americans who live in these troubled times under a regime that has shown it has no regard for any prosperity. But the hypocrisy and irony does not elude me. It's easier to tell someone to risk their life, than to actually risk your own life.

"Absolute nonsense- dangerous nonsense. This is all right out of the Trump propaganda train; this fantasy world he lives in, where any lie he tells us the truth just because he says it.  Putin knows that Trump is exactly the person to pick a fight with, because no fight will happen- Trump will roll over, give him everything he wants, and then pick a fight with Putin's adversaries to make them swallow it. We have abundant evidence of this- it is literally all he has done since winning office.  China will absolutely invade Taiwan, and most likely Trump wants them to. Trump's own aggressive rhetoric about Canada and Greenland gives a comprehensive green light to China to do whatever they want with the island, safe in the knowledge that Trump doesn't care because illegal, violent expansionism is on his own menu.   Xi will invade Taiwan, Trump will not lift a finger, and then he will use that precedent as a basis to seize Greenland from a NATO member.  As for his ""unpredictability"" making him dangerous to others; no one knows what his *policy* will be from one day to the next, but in most things Trump is entirely predictable.   He admires and fears strongmen dictators.  Flattery (of him) gets you everywhere, as does bribery  And if you offend him, he will strike back, hit out, and it has to be bigger than your hit on him.   But at his heart, he is a coward.  He doesn't have the stomach for any kind of war or long conflict that would require a lot of work of him.

"Your casual suggestion that America would ""just annihilate whoever"" challenged it perfectly encapsulates the imperial mindset that has defined our foreign policy for generations. But what you're describing isn't strength—it's the terminal condition of an empire in hospice care.  The asymmetry you highlight—where the U.S. can launch missiles with impunity while others must endure them silently—reveals the fundamental contradiction of American power. We've constructed a global order where violence is only called ""war"" when directed against us or our interests. When we bomb Yemen, it's a ""limited operation."" If Yemen retaliated against the U.S. homeland, it would be an ""act of war"" justifying total annihilation. This isn't diplomacy; it's a global protection racket masquerading as international order.  But look closer at what this ""annihilation"" capability has actually accomplished. Twenty years in Afghanistan ended in humiliating withdrawal. Iraq remains a strategic disaster. Our strikes against the Houthis have failed to stop their attacks on shipping. The empire can still bomb, but it can no longer win. We've become Rome in decline—an overstretched military machine defending a hollowed-out economic core.  This military overreach isn't a sign of strength but the death rattle of a fading hegemon. History teaches us that empires don't collapse because they lack weapons; they collapse because they cannot stop using them. We launch missiles into Yemen not because it's effective, but because we've exhausted all other instruments of power. Our manufacturing base has been hollowed out by the very capitalist system we claim to be defending. Our financial system serves the few while crushing the many. Our cultural leadership erodes as our social contract disintegrates.  What you dismiss as Yemen being ""not dumb enough"" to declare war is actually the grotesque reality of imperial domination in its twilight phase. The true purpose of our ""defensive measures"" isn't protecting Americans; it's securing resource extraction points, maintaining corporate access to cheap labor, and ensuring the uninterrupted flow of capital. When our missiles fall on foreign soil, they're protecting quarterly profits, not people.  The American century is ending not with triumph but with the pathetic spectacle of a former industrial powerhouse whose ruling class has cannibalized its own productive capacity. We spend more on our military than the next nine countries combined, yet cannot secure our objectives against vastly outmatched opponents. This isn't peace through strength; it's the morphine drip of an imperial system in its final days—still able to destroy, but no longer able to build or win.",DownWithMatt,2025-03-28T17:37:55,3

">You sure they weren't Trump voters?  I can't even be sure they were American. But it's not actually isolated cases of sentiment; you only need to google ""Russian invasion Ukraine reddit"" and look for posts made around the time to see that a vast majority of threads will showcase this behavior.  It should be mentioned that this wasn't limited to Americans at all and plenty of people in Europe and my own country saw it the same way. I remember having conversations with my Serbian friend and comparing notes from our two countries and concluding that no matter the side of the aisle, those Russians who fled were held in controversial regard.  It's more ironic with America because ""American people"" (whoever they may be) often talks about freedom and such. I too like humor and comedy playing off this trope, like ""America, fuck yeah!"" and some guy in a scooter with guns drifting over a golf course. So I don't mind the culture, it's just that there's something seriously wrong going on and I'm not seeing anywhere near the uproar that I'd expect from elsewhere.  Of course my perspective is limited as I'm a foreigner. This is just my view of it all and shouldn't be misconstrued as something I think to be fact.  >but I would venture that you weren't communicating with individuals who shall take part in it.  I hope not. But given that I communicated with people from all over the globe and would majorly find this contempt anywhere, I expect that sadly I were. Many big traditionally left-leaning subreddits chastised Russians, and that includes r/Europe; it was the big thing at the time, and it seemed no matter left or right everyone cheered and united in their hatred for Russia.  >Speaking for myself and most people I know, we who are against Trump were not lashing out against the ordinary Russians who didn't want to ride the Z train. Nor were we so optimistic about the US's alleged immunity to being dominated by a Big Man.  I appreciate hearing this. Sometimes anecdotes are best fought with another anecdote, and I think it's good that there are people out there reminding others that people do care in the USA.  But I'm still not very optimistic looking at current optics. I compare to countries like UK, France, Spain, or hell, even my own country Sweden, and we take to the street for far less. I just cannot fathom a society so pacified that there is no noise yet coming from the US population.  People keep speaking about a breaking point, but in my mind, the US population has already crossed several breaking points. No functioning healthcare, record amount of personal bankruptcies, extreme and want-on police violence across all states, impunity for criminal politicians, insurance companies that skim the most absolute poorest of individuals while their shareholders and board members are becoming ultra-rich, a judiciary system that interferes with medical exertise and knowledge and causes needless death and suffering, foreign election interference and no response to that at all...  ... and this is just the cream on top. CIA assassinating people around the world on a yearly basis? Poisonings water supply in countries like Honduras, where an estimated 160k people died? Or what about poisoned waters in the USA itself; remember Flint? Well, Reuters actually found 3000 places \*far\* worse than Flint. Speaking of lead poisoning, why is there so much lead in American food? Pharmaceutical companies that were found guilty of making millions of Americans addicted to opiates, and as a result average age expectancy dropped by 3 years? What about special education centers that users electric shocks to torture developmentally damaged children so badly that they end up needing treatment from third degree wounds - from electricity?  I could go on and on and on and on but the truth is, what's the point? There's really no point, because it just seems to me Americans do not care.  I would bet all the money I own that before Trump you did not see much reason to protest. That by itself is already depressing.

"Your attempt to defend American militarism with “survival of the fittest” and “might makes right” doesn’t just reek of moral laziness—it’s a case study in the intellectual bankruptcy of imperial thinking. These aren’t immutable laws of nature; they’re ideological fig leaves draped over centuries of domination, collapsing the moment you actually interrogate them.  You’re not describing *strength*—you’re describing stagnation. Real strength in 2025 isn’t about who can throw the biggest punch; it’s about who can adapt to complexity, build resilient systems, and maintain internal cohesion in a world that’s increasingly interconnected and unstable. The nations thriving today aren’t the ones hoarding missiles—they’re the ones investing in education, infrastructure, diplomacy, and public health. Meanwhile, the U.S. is still treating every problem like a nail because it refuses to put down the hammer.  You say “we used to swing from trees” as if launching drone strikes is an evolutionary triumph. It’s not. It’s regression. Empire isn’t a sign of advancement—it’s what happens when a society builds bigger weapons instead of better systems. Rome didn’t collapse because it ran out of swords—it collapsed because it lost the cohesion, adaptability, and strategic vision to wield them intelligently. Sound familiar?  This isn’t about the current administration or the last—it’s about a bipartisan, decades-long addiction to military solutions for non-military problems. A trillion-dollar war machine that hasn’t secured a decisive win since WWII. A military that can destroy but not build. An economy gutted by that obsession, feeding defense contractors while bridges collapse and social trust disintegrates.  So no, this isn’t about rejecting ""survival of the fittest."" It’s about redefining what *fitness* actually means in a world where brute force alone is a liability, not an asset. Clinging to “might makes right” isn’t realism—it’s empire cosplay for people who mistake destruction for dominance.

As long as humans organize into groups and have strongly held but mutually exclusive opinions on something, violence will always be a backstop for any mass social interaction. All other things aside, it's too easy for someone to fall back to it, and as long as one person or group is willing to use violence to impose their views then everyone else needs to be able to use violence to defend them.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-27T12:51:00,4

"Appreciate that, seriously. And I say that not just for the compliment, but because shifting our collective narrative *starts* with being willing to engage—even when it’s uncomfortable or unfamiliar. That’s how systems change: one perspective at a time, one layer deeper.  The real goal isn’t to “win” an argument—it’s to invite people to ask different questions. Not just “who has the most power,” but “what are we doing with it?” Not just “how do we survive,” but “what are we surviving *for*?” Because a species that can build global networks out of photons and silicon shouldn’t still be organizing its affairs like medieval warlords with better gear.  We’ve hit a point where our tools have evolved faster than our frameworks. And unless we upgrade the *software*—the cultural assumptions, economic systems, and power structures that guide how we use those tools—we’re just high-tech cavemen with guided missiles.  So the real conversation isn’t “Can we dominate?” It’s “Can we transcend?” Can we design systems that make violence not heroic, but obsolete?

"Looking to other species as justification for human violence is exactly the kind of circular reasoning that keeps us trapped. Yes, chimps fight. Ants wage war. But neither of them split the atom or wrote symphonies or developed ethical frameworks that transcend their immediate survival instincts.  The ""but violence is natural"" argument isn't evidence—it's surrender. It's intellectual capitulation disguised as pragmatism. We selectively borrow from evolutionary biology when it suits our narrative of inevitability, then conveniently ignore it when we claim to be the planet's superior species.  What makes us ""intelligent"" isn't our capacity for war—it's our capacity to recognize patterns and break them. Every major human advancement has come from someone refusing to accept the limitations of their time. Flight was ""impossible"" until it wasn't. Global communication was ""impossible"" until it wasn't. A world beyond organized violence isn't some utopian fantasy—it's the next evolutionary threshold we refuse to cross because we're too invested in the machinery of destruction.  The problem isn't that we lack a baseline comparison for intelligence beyond humans. The problem is we refuse to create one. We're using ""there's no evidence"" as an excuse to avoid becoming the evidence.  You're right that I won't talk every violent person out of violence. But systems can be designed that don't require universal compliance to function. We didn't eliminate smallpox by convincing every virus to stop being a virus—we created conditions where it couldn't spread.

"Dismissing the drive for a fundamentally different world as a 'shiny, happy' dream is a classic deflection; it’s easier than confronting the grim reality that our *current* systems actively cultivate the conditions for violence and then use that violence as their primary tool of control. This isn't about some naive yearning from antiquity; it's about a pragmatic assessment that the status quo – built on coercion, systemic deprivation, and the ever-present threat of 'organized murder' – is not only failing us but actively consuming us.  Now, let's tackle this assertion that even an 'ideal' system requires violence. Does it require ways to handle conflict, address harm, and deal with individuals who refuse to respect the well-being of others? Of course. Does that mean it *relies* on violence in the same way a state relies on police and military force, or capitalism relies on the violence of poverty and eviction? Absolutely not. Equating community safety protocols or mechanisms for dealing with irreconcilable harm with the *systemic violence* inherent in current power structures is a false equivalence. It conflates a fire extinguisher with an arsonist's toolkit.  You ask what my 'ideal system' does about people who *choose* violence, suggesting I've 'glossed over' it. I haven't glossed over it; I fundamentally reframe it.  First, you build a society that drastically *reduces the incentives and conditions* that breed violence: eliminate poverty through universal basic services, provide robust mental and physical healthcare, foster strong community bonds, address trauma systematically, ensure education and opportunity. You starve the roots of violence.  Second, when conflict or harm occurs, the primary responses are non-violent: mediation, restorative justice, community accountability processes designed to repair harm, not just punish the actor. De-escalation is the default, not the exception.    But what about the 'hard cases'? The individuals who, even in a supportive system, remain intent on causing harm? The goal remains preventing harm, not enacting vengeance. Yes, as an absolute last resort, separating such an individual from the community to prevent further violence might be necessary. But this isn't the punitive, dehumanizing warehousing we call prison. Think of it less like a cage and more like a form of societal quarantine – focused solely on preventing harm, undertaken with reluctance, and always coupled with continued efforts toward understanding, rehabilitation, or management, however slim the chances seem. It’s a response to a specific danger, not a foundational pillar of the social order.  The crucial difference is intent and structure. Our current systems *require* violence – or its credible threat – to maintain property relations, enforce hierarchy, and secure power. They are *built* on it. The goal of a truly evolved system is to make violence increasingly *obsolete* and *unnecessary*, treating outbreaks as failures to be studied and mitigated, not as proof of its own grim necessity.

"You're still operating within the cage of nation-state thinking—a cramped intellectual prison that treats the Westphalian system as if it were some immutable law of physics rather than a 400-year-old European invention designed specifically to end religious wars while facilitating imperial expansion.  Nation-states aren't cosmic constants. They're relatively recent artifacts—products of specific historical conditions and power arrangements. They didn't emerge naturally from human cooperation; they were constructed deliberately through violence, enclosure, and forced assimilation. The nation-state is capitalism's preferred political container—a bounded territory where resources, labor, and markets can be controlled and militarily defended.  Your question about ""foreign nations invading to take your stuff"" perfectly illustrates the limitation of your framework. It assumes that humanity must remain perpetually divided into competing territorial gangs, each jealously guarding ""their stuff"" against outsiders. But this arrangement isn't inevitable—it's maintained through deliberate structures of separation and manufactured scarcity.  The technological reality of our era has already outgrown these archaic boundaries. Information crosses borders at light speed. Translation algorithms render language barriers increasingly irrelevant. Supply chains span continents. Culture flows globally. Capital certainly doesn't respect national boundaries—why should human solidarity?  Climate catastrophe doesn't check passports. Pandemics don't stop at border walls. Ecological collapse laughs at your imaginary lines on maps. These existential threats require coordination at scales that make nation-states look like squabbling feudal manors. The question isn't whether my ""ideal society"" needs military defenses against invaders. The question is what happens when enough people across enough arbitrary borders realize they share more in common with each other than with the ruling classes of their respective nation-states, and begin acting accordingly.  This isn't utopian dreaming—it's adaptation to reality. The internet didn't ask permission from governments to rewire global communication. Solar energy doesn't need military protection to harness the sun. Distributed systems of production and coordination are already emerging that make centralized state control increasingly obsolete.  What you dismiss as ""left-wing utopianism"" is precisely what's required to survive the century. We need global systems of cooperation and resource distribution not because they're morally superior (though they are), but because they're the only arrangements capable of addressing planetary-scale problems. The alternative isn't your cynical ""realism""—it's extinction.  The greatest trick the ruling class ever pulled was convincing you that the temporary political arrangement called the nation-state—barely 1% of human history—represents the outer limit of our organizational capacity. What breathtaking lack of imagination. What willing enslavement to artificial constraints.  Defense against invaders? Who's invading whom exactly? The question reveals its own absurdity when you realize most global conflict stems from competition over artificially scarce resources within a system that requires both scarcity and competition to function.

A better welfare state isn't going to solve an Elon Musk or Muammar Gaddafi who decides that their place in the system is below their self-perception of their worth and they need to be more important. Or some self-declared prophet that decides that wiping your ass with your *left* hand is an irredeemable sin worthy of death, or whatever other cultural or religious conflict that sparks off next. And mediation isn't going to catch everyone that is smart enough to game the system and gather followers. Even *if* your Utopia is able to spread across the world through the strength of its' ideals and beats their swords into ploughshares, you still need to have something to deal with folks that *aren't* convinced by your ideology.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-03-28T07:44:37,2
"The irony of calling an anti-violence position ""naive"" while accepting violence as ""legitimate"" without questioning the basis of that legitimacy is the intellectual equivalent of a circular firing squad. You've mistaken your conditioning for clarity.  Let's dissect this: you claim violence is ""extremely effective."" Effective at what, exactly? If your metric is immediate compliance, sure—just as amputation is ""effective"" at removing gangrenous limbs. But effectiveness isn't a moral argument; it's a utilitarian one. Nuclear weapons are ""effective"" too. So is torture. So is genocide. The observation that violence ""works"" in producing compliance is trivial—the question is what it destroys in the process.  Your ""foundation of sand"" accusation reveals more about your intellectual scaffolding than mine. You've accepted the legitimacy of violence without examining its premises—a position so normalized that you mistake its ubiquity for inevitability. This is like a medieval serf arguing that monarchy is ""extremely effective"" without questioning why kings exist in the first place.  What you call ""reality"" is just the current iteration of social arrangements—arrangements that were violently installed and are violently maintained. Every empire believed its methods were simply ""reality"" right until collapse. Every slaveowner believed human bondage was natural law. Every colonial power justified theft and murder as the ""reality"" of civilizational progress.  You claim I have ""no basis"" for disqualifying violence beyond personal preference. This demonstrates a profound unfamiliarity with several thousand years of ethical philosophy, from Buddhist nonviolence to Kantian ethics to contemporary human rights frameworks—all of which provide systematic, reasoned arguments against violence that have nothing to do with mere preference.  The truly naive position is believing that organized violence—the deliberate infliction of suffering—represents the summit of human problem-solving rather than its most primitive failure mode. It's mistaking the evolutionary equivalent of a vestigial organ for the pinnacle of social technology.  Violence isn't legitimate because it's effective. It's considered effective because those with power have declared it legitimate. That's not reality—that's hegemony. And hegemony, like all historical constructs, can be dismantled and replaced.  Instead of dismissing cooperation as ""fluffy words,"" perhaps consider why your imagination is so constrained that you can only conceive of human relations through the lens of domination. That limitation isn't realism—it's intellectual surrender.",DownWithMatt,2025-03-28T10:04:19,0
