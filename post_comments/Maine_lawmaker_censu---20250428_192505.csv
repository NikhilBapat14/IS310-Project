"Here’s what I think about just about anything under the “woke” issues umbrella, whether that be “DEI”, “critical race theory”, “transgenders” in women sports, “gender affirming care”,  etc.  1. Both Democrats and Republicans talk about these issues about 100 times as often as they should.  2. Honestly, I only about half-understand what these disputes are even about. For example, I don't really understand exactly what  DEI is and how DEI differs from what used to be called affirmative action. I also only about half-understand what critical race theory is supposed to mean. And I don't really understand exactly what qualifies as gender affirming care.      Nor do I really care about what DEI, critical race theory, and gender affirming care are supposed to mean.  3.  I think it’s pretty stupid that any voter would base their vote on these issues.  4. With that being said, some voters do base their vote on those issues. And most of those voters vote for Republicans.  5. Despite how much Republicans overobsess on these stupid “issues”, at least Republicans win votes by overobsessing on these stupid issues. It’s doubly stupid that Democrats overobsess on these stupid issues, since Democrats are losing votes by overobsessing on these stupid issues. ",Mediocre_Owl_8475,2025-04-28T19:55:05,-13

"I agree, today a lot of what we discuss is:  * identity fighting(I'm trans, this is important to me but ultimately the question should be about something else, like autonomy of body) * resource hoarding(we talk about taxing the rich as a 'maybe' solution instead of really looking at things and making predictive models to get collective authentic buy in by also restoring trust or something else) * slogan loyalty(a good slogan can win things, even if the win is based in things bad for people. Dissent is punished in parties which really contributes to an insane amount of tribalism) * soundbite noise(sound bites that intentionally take things out of context to make a subconscious ad-hominim like attack and bog down useful discource) * symptom treating(""its better than before, why are we still talking about this?"" is a common vibe) * historical blame(without anyone really accepting apologies and assuming they are made politically in bad faith, always. Moving the goal post on what is needed to move past this, and in a way it makes sense because each post reached reveals further inequities)  A good idea of some things to maybe start discussing instead would be:  * How do we structurally embed dignity into legal, economic, and educational systems with engineered intention? * How do we reward renewable relational flourishing instead of flourishing at other's expense? * How do we build ethical communities that survive betrayals without becoming oppressive? * How do we redesign incentives to grow care rather than exploitation? * How do we create systems where cruelty structurally cannot take root easily or unknowingly?  these are the things I think are way more valuable and are much further upstream from the discussions we currently have in general.",samuraiseoul,2025-04-29T03:01:42,1
It's actually factual. Maga always brings up cultural issues. Democrats basic stance actually never changed. It's don't control peoples lives and let them be free of harassment. Republicans love to bring up random cultural issues non stop. No one talked about the 1% of trans people until they cried.,Faucet860,2025-04-28T20:02:56,10
