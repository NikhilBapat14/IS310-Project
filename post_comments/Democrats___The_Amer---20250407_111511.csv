"Get it up asap, you're fighting a losing war at the moment. The Republican propaganda machine (Fox News) is in full swing. Definite step in the right direction though.",primax1uk,2025-04-07T11:47:52,87
I mean they should have started this in November or better yet the second they knew he was running again.,lnc_5103,2025-04-07T11:53:44,52
The problem with this is that the people who need to hear this information won‚Äôt. They‚Äôre too far gone.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-04-07T12:12:28,14
"FYI, the new twist to this rapid response ‚Äúwar room‚Äù is the use of micro-influencers.   It‚Äôs still years late - influencer marketing isn‚Äôt new, and Trump has been courting the influencer space for the past few years - but that‚Äôs the difference between previous rapid response effoets and this one.",jar45,2025-04-07T12:14:40,10

"The problem with countering misinformation is that you're countering after the fact - and its extremely hard to counter it because usually misinformation and disinformation have nuggets of truth within them that allow people to easily grasp on to, and it feeds into their own ideology and desires for belonging.  And they're not gonna change course on things without hearing it from someone they trust.  Dems need to be proactive about having honest conversations in areas where they'd never been expected to set foot... they need to go into those places and listen, and empathize, and ask those people how they would want to see the issues they face solved... only then may they be able to build the trust necessary to counter disinformation and misinformation.",Bmorgan1983,2025-04-07T13:13:31,6
"People fail to realize that even without  tariffs, many of the horrible things that Trump has unleashed are as bad for the market as they are for the country.  The crash has only just begun.",HawaiiStockguy,2025-04-07T13:15:09,5

"Bout fucking time. They better take the gloves off for this. Hold nothing back and know they need to be in it for the long haul. This is a war which will, unfortunately, need to be fought in social media. Godspeed Dems!!! üôÇ",scifijunkie3,2025-04-07T13:27:54,3

Are there any efforts to mitigate right-wing conspiracy spaces like Truth Social or Facebook? Anything to break their bubble of disinformation? Right now there are tens of millions of voters who are voting based on a steady diet of fake news.,handsoapdispenser,2025-04-07T13:55:58,2

"Good. It‚Äôs about damn time. There‚Äôs some REALLY good voices out there in the liberal, progressive and leftist spaces and it‚Äôs time the Democratic Party started taking advantage of it, instead of trying to push them out.   The Right has known how to do this for awhile. They have a whole machine dedicated to it of both mainstream and alternative media sources as well as non-traditional media sources like gaming live streamers and shit like that. Not everyone gets their info from dedicated news media sources. In fact most people don‚Äôt. So if the only way you‚Äôre getting your message out there is with traditional news media, you‚Äôre already behind.",BronzeRider,2025-04-07T17:15:38,1
They need to stop calling it Trump's agenda and call it the Republican administration's agenda. None of this continues without the support of Republican leaders. Hold them accountable and remind voters which party is to blame.,Kazzie2Y5,2025-04-07T19:03:37,1
"I will believe it when I see it. I am not donating to the party, only individuals who are actually doing something.

I said the same but better late than never.   I downloaded Groundnews and it gives perspective from all sides while also labeling the slant and misinformation gauge. It‚Äôs amazing how much news is never reported on conservative sites or is mostly wrong.,-something_original-,2025-04-07T13:59:02,5

"Which is great! And I follow it too. Same with BTC's stuff. But they need to start getting the official channels rolling.  And definitely show the protests, and not mince words when it comes to the numbers. There were 5.2 million people across the country on the 5th.
