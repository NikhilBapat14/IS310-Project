"It is crazy that the American electorate is rejecting essentially all enlightenment ideas, and seem to want to go back to a period of time before, where we were not ruled by law or reason.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T09:26:09,13
"Yes, we are seeing the death of enlightenment in the US.   From intellectual freedom to artistic freedom, the American people are turning against both.",Joadzilla,2025-04-30T10:38:08,5
We're the most educated generation in history. These are growing pains we need to be brave enough to push through.,PowerlineCourier,2025-04-30T11:05:18,1
The end of the enlightenment? Y’all take yourselves far too seriously.  Civilization is not going to crumble because the US is in trouble.,sharp11flat13,2025-04-30T13:59:19,1

Brother they aren’t rejecting Thomas Hobbes ideas ? The enlightenment isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-30T09:31:03,1
"> The MAGA minority, might, but they are not America and do not speak for us.  That was believable in Trump’s first term. After America willingly voted him in a second time they are absolutely speaking for your country. The majority of the population either directly supports MAGA’s actions or is too apathetic to care about anything outside of their personal circle.",TheCreepyFuckr,2025-04-30T11:44:23,2

"> There were a shitload of people who voted against him, an thousands, if not millions more who had their votes thrown out or otherwise suppressed.  I never said I blame democratic voters, nor am I blaming the disenfranchised that couldn’t vote. I blame MAGA/Republicans and the millions that could have voted to prevent Trump yet did nothing out of “protest” or apathy.  Unfortunately though the people that voted against Trump are a minority in America. [There are approximately 244,666,890 voting eligible adults](https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/), of that only 75,017,613 people voted for Harris. So, as I stated, the vast majority either directly support Trump or didn’t care enough to vote against him. They are the ones I blame, and they are a majority of America.",TheCreepyFuckr,2025-04-30T12:42:49,1
