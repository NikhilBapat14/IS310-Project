"So, Trump is setting the stage for Bessent to be able to lower the tariffs on China.  You knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of how.  That said, tariffs of even 10% will have a profound effect.",Smithy2232,2025-05-09T08:38:01,14

"Trump is sounding more and more like a mob boss on trial.  ""I don't know.  Hey, waddya gonna do?  Nobody told me.  Vinny takes care of that stuff.""

What do you want to bet conveniently Bessent will say ‘no’ because it’s totally his decision and not Trump’s?,Cactusfan86,2025-05-09T08:38:37,1
