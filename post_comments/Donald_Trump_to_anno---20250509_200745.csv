So the source is not saying that Trump will recognize the state of Palestine.  The source is saying that Trump will say something regarding recognition.  It could be recognition, it could be a promise to recognize if some deal is struck, or even something more vague than that.",kaleidist,2025-05-10T15:17:27,1

"Nobody in the region or who truly wants what's best for the people of the Middle East should be supporting or promoting any of the Shia-aligned jihadist group, including Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis, or Iran itself.

Other sources state that he is looking to get over a trillion dollars worth of investments in order to shore up US economy during the tariffs. His last term saw investments of over 400 billion from the Gulf states.

"The article hedges. There's an anonymous source that says he'll declare, but the article goes on to say that other named sources say this is unlikely based on the fact that neither Eygpts President or the Jordanian king are attending the summit. It's likely going to be a lot of deals made between Trump and the Saudis/UAE/Qatar, maybe even tariff exemptions.",SomecallmeJorge,2025-05-09T22:12:19,4
"You should still remain cautious and skeptical, but Trump really isn’t a man of principles. He doesn’t care about anything, but himself which is a double edge sword. I could easily see him turn against Bibi or ethnically cleanse Gaza and go to war with Iran.",jankdangus,2025-05-10T01:05:04,3

Yeah I’m all for Palestine being its own nation but none of that will erase what the tariffs are causing.,Ianthin1,2025-05-09T20:32:37,5
Most Gulf states don’t particularly care for Palestinian statehood. They certainly don’t care enough to invest $1T or anything near it. Especially after the Abraham Accords.  This just sounds like a bunch of bull.,EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-09T20:20:59,4

"Yeah, Trump is ironically less controlled by the donor money because he’s too corrupt personally. He likes being popular and have accolades to his name, and the least popular thing you can do rn is remain a bitch for Israel and let the war in the Middle East to continue since Bibi is not a partner for peace. He’s probably eying that Nobel Peace Prize as well which he will definitely get if he is able to end the war in Ukraine and Israel.",jankdangus,2025-05-09T23:53:56,1

"You guys aren't thinking of the big picture when it comes to the gulf and their goals. They want a unified Arab market. That's a market of almost 400 million people that the gulf companies with their trillions can dominate.

"For whatever Trump's faults are, his aversion to war is not one of them. Between avoiding war in Syria and normalizing relations with the UAE in his first term, to campaigning on ending the Ukraine-Russia war and now telling Bibi to kick rocks because he doesn't want to wage a war with Iran on Israel's behalf, its clear that Trump is the most anti-war president we've seen in decades.",LagiacrusEnjoyer,2025-05-10T04:39:05,-1
