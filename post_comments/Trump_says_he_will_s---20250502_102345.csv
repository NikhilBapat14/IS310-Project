Time for Harvard to say it’s a religious institution,MattieCoffee,2025-05-02T10:26:26,11
Someone should do a running tally on how much Donald Trump is costing us in lawsuits.  Similar to what is being done with his golfing costs.,TSHRED56,2025-05-02T10:33:47,9
"I’ve made this comment previously, but lets think about this.   1. Trump’s team sends letter to Harvard with demands. 2. Harvard says “no” to said demands. 3. Trumps team says letter was sent “in error”.  4. Trumps team gets upset and says Harvard “should apologize”.   And now they’re doubling down and saying they’ll strip their tax exempt status and are withholding grant money for research. Give me an fn break.",Chadmc56,2025-05-02T10:48:44,8

It's funny watching the left find reasons to hate Trump for this,Impossible-Wear-7179,2025-05-02T11:37:23,-8
And it needs to be good enough for Harvard to not just sue the goverment for violatig the 1'st amendment's right to free speach.,Erikblod,2025-05-02T10:31:19,14
"Serious question.  DO you really, really think they give a rats ass about the Constitution?  We need to understand that they clearly do not.  Expecting them to is leading to defeat.  They are depending on our belief that they believe in the tenets of the document, while everything they've done since his inauguration is in total opposition to it.",2cigsaday,2025-05-02T13:42:41,2

Harvard's endowment does pay for the education of thousands of poor Americans. They are not a corporation. Get your facts straight.,DetectiveExisting590,2025-05-02T10:53:15,2
"I know right, how dare people hate on someone for trying to do something illegal. The gull of people.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-02T12:56:01,4
The sad reason I think Harvard can win is because the scotus doesn’t care about antisemitism which is what Trump is pretending to care about . If it was something Christianity related they’d be screwed,Savagevandal85,2025-05-02T10:35:07,5
