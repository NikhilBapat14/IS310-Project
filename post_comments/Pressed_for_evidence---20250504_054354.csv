"Trump said he doesn't care about separation of church and state and that he wants to bring religion back to America. He also posted an AI generated image of himself as the pope. I know that Trump personally has never read the bible and cannot quote any passages at all. Well, he doesn't read actually at all, the only known book he has said he has by his bed side table is a book of Hitlers speeches. But he likes to pretend that he is a christian    Trump's Cult is made up of masses of Nationalistic Christians, and pretending to help spread ""Gods Message"" plays well to his base. So rounding up atheists and adding them to his concentration camps is a likely next step. The Nat-c's would love to see Atheists nailed to a cross.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-04T06:19:49,33

"Trump is a white supremacist, and Steve Miller is also a white supremist at the head of a Nazi program to deport people based only on their race. We are only 100 days in, and Trump has signed an executive order to integrate the military into the police and give ICE additional powers to round up people that he doesn't like. He already deported American citizens to El Salvador death camps against the legal protections provided to them in the constitution, and when the Supreme court ruled 9 -0 to return him, Trump STILL hasn't returned the man even though it has been 27 days, he just refuses to do it.    So yeah, I would say that the Criminal in the white house wants to deport people to fulfill a sick white supremacy fantasy, and unfortunately, it's only going to get worse the longer he gets to remain president.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-04T06:11:31,7
