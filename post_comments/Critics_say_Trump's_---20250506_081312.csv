Can someone tell me why i would want to bring a kid out into a world circling the toilet?,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-05-06T08:18:17,134
"Decided not to have kids when I turned 30.  Zero regrets and there is no way I’d ever consider having kids in the US these days.  Not only is it completely cost prohibitive, but our school system is diminishing year after to year to absolute low level quality and moving towards a “pay as you go” charter system (while property and school taxes only increase).  Trump proposing a few thousand one time payment for a kid will pay for 1 months rent and food/gas.  Vs a lifetime of a child costing much much more.  I’m now curious if anyone has done that math (cost of having a child in 2025 for 18 years).  …and kids aren’t moving out of mom and dads due to high rent.  So it extends way past 18 years these days.  And college tuition is insane.  Just sayin.",illCommunicationII,2025-05-06T08:32:46,22

"This will get you at most 5 months of childcare if you live in a low cost area. And there's no paid family leave, so unless your employer offers it, this bonus won't even help much your first year. And if you have a high deductible insurance plan, the hospital bill for having the baby will still eat at least half of this.    I love my kids. And we're going to be fine. But a couple of setbacks last year means we are going to have to sell the house and go back to renting. Not the ideal for raising kids but hey it's what the majority of parents do isn't it? $5,000 would be nice but it would be gone in seconds in most households with overdue debts, car repairs, house repairs and/or medical expenses. ",Sad_Pangolin7379,2025-05-06T08:42:47,4
"It's so funny how Republicans can acknowledge the problem is the cost of raising children, while also refusing all of the real proposals to lower that cost.   They're against universal pre-K and guaranteed maternity/paternity leave when those are the biggest costs of raising children.

Five thousand dollars isn't going to do shit for that.",esoteric_enigma,2025-05-06T10:47:06,3
"As someone looking at fatherhood sooner rather than later: Childcare is outrageous. It’s the single fastest inflating expense category. More than housing, healthcare, anything.   What used to be a punchline of Bay Area tiger parents as a kid has become the standard. Every place is $2,500-3,500/mo/child. They’re all ridiculously over the top, teaching your kid six different languages that are completely useless (I grew up bilingual, I can tell you it’s useless speaking a language neither your family nor the majority speak). Your median daycare is this ridiculously precocious “academy” where multiple masters level workers are assigned to one or two children. States have instituted well-meaning, but flawed minimum standards that have cranked the price of childcare up to the stratosphere. Trust me, your infant does not need to have university professors “teaching” them, learn Mandarin, go to the opera, or any other such overpriced nonsense I’ve seen in these places.   We can certainly do single income (with some difficulty, but it’s doable) but my wife’s career can’t stand taking off 3-5 years. She’d be starting all over again. Plus she’d go nuts by her own admission.  For what it’s worth, we are very much upper middle class. Current HHI is a touch over $300K cash, excluding stock or bonus, we’re both well educated, well qualified white collar professionals. Childcare is *still* wildly expensive for us. God knows how other people are doing this. One kid? Doable. But two or more? Fuck me sideways.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-06T08:23:33,7

"We were around $10k out of pocket, with insurance, per kid.   Daycare in the Seattle area, cheapest I could find, ran about $2k per month and then gradually droppes as they got older to about $1200 per month.   So by the time the kid hits kindergarten you are already in well over $100k per kid.   We literally took loans to make kids happen for us as it's something we really wanted. My boomer parents keep asking how much we have saved for college, my answer is always ""about negative $X"" x being how much is left on the HELOC.",Embarrassed-Pride776,2025-05-06T08:47:52,3

Businessmen don't understand how humans function and only understand incentives. Improving conditions is too costly and something like morale doesn't guarantee a change you can quantify on paper so a small incentive or punishment is all they can imagine.   If giving young people a pittance doesn't work in making them pop out more children they're going to start punishing them for not doing so because it's all they know.,context_hell,2025-05-06T09:09:08,3

"Hearing this reminded me of the time when the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu, starting in the 80's, wanted families to have more children, for another reason and took it to the extreme, but I wouldn't put it past trump to go crazy. His reasoning was that he wanted to increase the workforce thinking it would help their economy. He banned abortion, contraceptives, and offered incentives and benefits to have more kids. Their economy crashed to the point families were giving up kids to orphanages because they could barely feed them. The state built orphanages to take care of them and let's just say what they did to those ""lost children of Nicolae Ceaușescu"" was the most atrocious thing in history, and yes I think worse than the Nazis.

"I brought up this exact point with my husband when discussing the insult of the paltry credit and disappearing social safety nets. We're both in our 40s and I was surprised that he had no idea about the Romanian orphanages. I remember it showing up on the evening news pretty prominently and hearing the adults talk about how horrific it was. Didn't know what led to it til I was an adult, but I thought most people over 30 had at least a fuzzy memory of it happening. While a lot of people have a reasonable fear that Gilead is one of this regime's goals, I don't believe there's anyone competent enough orchestrate that  level of organization here. I think it's more realistic that we'll see a Romanian situation if they decide to fixate on the birth rate issue. Perhaps it would start like the Depression when people were selling their kids for food, but at some point there would come the issue of too many kids and too few resources country-wide.

It's actually amazing how realistic the anime is, shedding light on awful historical events like that, and stuff that goes on in the underworld.
