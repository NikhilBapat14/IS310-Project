Maybe the older Dems who've been in office for decades should realize they and their policies in some small way gave rise to Trump and that since they cannot grasp new ideas it's time to go. It seems like the rules of the game have changed and Dems are slow to realize it.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-05T11:55:11,16
"Nancy Peliosi destroyed the Progressive faction over and over during her reign, a d did it again on the way out. The old democrats aren't ""serving"" later in life - Cheney hung around *without a heartbeat* ffs - they just refuse to bring new blood in because they don't want to share the spoils and don't need young blood. They are there to support the republican agenda ",Legitimate_Eye8494,2025-05-05T11:59:51,12

"if democrats want to be the party for the people, the party who listens to voters, the party who is fighting for american greatness, they need to realize that those long term politicians fighting to keep their personal power are part of the problem.  these people need to let go for the greater good and let new minds take over to bring the democrats forward.  its the only way to bring in new voters and gain traction with a younger crowd.  this is a big part of why the republicans can keep saying there is a swamp to drain.  (yes plenty on that side as well) but turning over power to younger leadership will go a long way toward fixing their own parties problems.",VOIDsama,2025-05-05T12:32:00,3
">[Clyburn] holds an important role as the top Democrat on an Appropriations Committee subcommittee and indicated he isn’t interested in stepping aside.  >Nancy left her seat. Steny left his seat. I left my seat. What the hell I’m supposed to do now?” Clyburn said when asked whether the party needed to think of bringing in younger members. “What do you want—me to give up my life?  These people are going to cling to power until the very end.  Forget their families or generational wealth. Like Clyburn implied, this is their life.  This article says there have been five House members who have died in office since the start of 2024.  I think a fair amount of the Dem old guard would be proud to add their names to that list when the time comes.",ivesaidway2much,2025-05-05T13:45:21,2

I give them a little bit of benefit of the doubt. When so much of your self image is wrapped up in being in congress it can be hard to imagine doing anything else. I don't like it but I at least try to understand it. ,Helicase21,2025-05-05T12:46:28,1
