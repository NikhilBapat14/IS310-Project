And Musk is in his “Did I do that?” ERA.,BrutalHunny,2025-05-02T14:24:55,6
"Elon Musk’s so-called [Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)](https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/) operates on a core underlying assumption: The United States should be run like a startup. So far, that has mostly meant chaotic firings and an eagerness to steamroll regulations. But no pitch deck in 2025 is complete without an overdose of artificial intelligence, and DOGE is no different.  AI itself doesn’t reflexively deserve pitchforks. It has [genuine uses](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-lab-learning-japanese-with-chatgpt-tokyo/) and can create genuine efficiencies. It is not inherently untoward to introduce AI into a workflow, especially if you’re aware of and able to manage around its [limitations](https://www.wired.com/story/cursor-ai-hallucination-policy-customer-service/). It’s not clear, though, that DOGE has embraced any of that nuance. If you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail; if you have the most access to the most sensitive data in the country, everything looks like an input.  Wherever DOGE has gone, AI has been in tow. Given the opacity of the organization, a lot remains unknown about how exactly it’s being used and where. But two revelations this week show just how extensive—and potentially misguided—DOGE’s AI aspirations are.. So far, that has mostly meant chaotic firings and an eagerness to steamroll regulations. But no pitch deck in 2025 is complete without an overdose of artificial intelligence, and DOGE is no different.
