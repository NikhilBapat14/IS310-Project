"Democrats have a messaging problem first and foremost. We need to boil it down to a few simple and overarching talking points that hit this administration where it hurts (the economy, the Eon-lay Usk-may clown show, the Signal fiasco). Get out there in the community and hammer them home clearly, consistently and continually.",Most_Decision_282,2025-04-04T11:10:38,6
"Democrats should have one solitary point to run on, it’s such a gift-  Remove all tariffs, day 1  That’s it, that’s your way back in.",Solid-Reputation5032,2025-04-04T14:53:48,3
I wish someone in congress would have the nerve to repeal the emergency tariff law Trump is using.  That or go to the scotus as tariffs are the responsibility of Congress in the constitution.    The moron is destroying the country,ntantillo,2025-04-04T18:31:33,1
"Democrats' problem is that they take the bait.  CRT, DEI, trans athletes, due process, etc. are all designed on purpose to lock Dems into endlessly defending themselves to a public that ultimately only wants to hear, ""I have an idea.  It will work.""    The other problem is that Dems try too hard to be inclusive.  This will upset some around here, but if you want to win you gotta accept that some people, maybe even you, will be alienated.    All Dems need to do is to keep it simple.  Look at something that Republicans are saying right now -- they are claiming that DEI is discriminatory and racist and they keep saying 'equal opportunity' is the better, legal, option.  Of course this is a dog whistle, but it is effective and something that Dems could use.",crucial_geek,2025-04-04T13:59:48,4
"I was looking at clips of Bill Clinton campaigning in 1992, and that is the kind of messaging we need. He knew how to do it, and he made people feel optimistic. He pointed out how few jobs H.W. Bush created, the inflation that Reagan and Bush caused, and the rise in poverty over the last 12 years. Then he told the people he knows how to turn it around.      He told the people he knows the common sense ways to fix these, and made all of his policies sound like they're just common sense. Then he pointed out that if Republicans cared about everyday families, they would've done these.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-04T15:28:56,3
