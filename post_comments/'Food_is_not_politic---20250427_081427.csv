What’s also not political is planning to bulldoze Gaza and build a resort there but here we are. Pres 47 has all to gain and nothing to lose here.,Valyx_3,2025-04-27T08:17:32,22
"Using starvation as a weapon of war has always been a tactic. The USSR used it quite famously in Ukraine during WW2 and Israel is using it now in Gaza. Though the international community agreed by treaty to make this tactic illegal, it hasn't stopped the use of it because frankly it's too easy to implement. All you have to do  with a captive population is to stop food from passing checkpoints and shoot down any aircraft trying to airdrop food to the starving people below.",noncongruent,2025-04-27T11:09:49,4
Under the MAGATstration food is definitely political.,nwgdad,2025-04-27T08:15:58,11
"Food has always been political. Major famines in recent history were the result of politics, not drought or any kind of natural phenomenon. Potatoes in Ireland, rice in India, humanitarian aid and the deliberate destruction of food systems in Gaza by the IDF  (not allowed to raise cattle, Israel has burned down their olive groves, and of course has routinely blocked aid shipments).",Thatissogentle,2025-04-27T12:32:45,8
"More like food shouldn’t be political, but it definitely is. Sadly a lot of things shouldn’t be political, like not bombing a population of nearly 50% children into rubble. Or like I heard on NPR today, the reports from US medical doctors on the ground in Gaza that something like 85% of them experienced many children who were shot in the head or chest. So much so that many see no other explanation than many of them were targeted. This coming from doctors who participated in other war zones and still never saw anything like it in such scale.",keytotheboard,2025-04-27T12:56:24,2

You are comparing aggressors to victims.

"The British killed 30-60 million in the British Raj via starvation and never paid a dime in reparations.

"False.  Jews have been living there for thousands of years, long before the Arab Caliphates stole the land by force and colonized it.  What the Arab Caliphates did to the Middle East is the same thing European empires did to the Americas: conquest, colonization and forced conversions.  The Caliphates even had an African slave trade, just like the US and European empires.  The Caliphates stole land from Jews, Egyptians, Persians, Kurds, Yazidis, Christians and many other native people of the region.  The Cailphates and their successor states are the colonial empires of the region, and they are all tyrannical regimes, including the apartheid state of Palestine.

"Wrong.  Israel occupied Gaza for decades and they created Hamas and  then in 2006 Israel withdrew from Gaza knowing that Hamas would attack, and it was all an excuse for Israel to invade Gaza.  Netanyahu also pays Hamas.  This is the reason why Hamas has not released the hostages.  The world allows Israel to fight the war to get the hostages back.  But Hamas is paid to keep the hostages so Israel has an excuse to keep fighting the war.

"“Barbarically starved to death.” It’s quite telling that your focus on barbarism has eluded the past and current treatment of the Israeli hostages still held in terror dungeons with insufficient food and medical care.
