Most of us could humbly admit an error and suggest a correction, and the people around us would be graceful and understanding. That's part of what makes us human.  Trump cannot admit to himself that he ever made a mistake, that he ever did anything to be sorry for, or (the famous religious question) to ask forgiveness for.  Course correction and the ability to reassess a situation are fundamental to leadership, it's what makes choosing a leader so important.

His blatant lies no longer have any craft or subtlety to them.  He simply states obvious falsehoods without any hint of shame because he genuinely believes them to be true.  He really thinks he's a champion level golfer.  He really thinks the photoshoped 'MS13'  on Garcia's hand is a real tattoo.  He really thinks he's talked to Xi on the phone about the tariffs.

If you hooked Trump up to a perfect lie-detector and he said the sky is green"" the lie detector would not register.  That is the difference between typical people and narcissists. It is not a lie, because they said it. Look at the covfefe incident. Clearly a misspelled word, a mistake. But Trump effortlessly brushed it off and said it wasn't a mistake. And it's true. He is incapable of recognizing something he does as a mistake, or wrong, or incorrect. Incapable.

"I've maintained that this denial that Trump could ever be wrong cost him the 2020 election because of how badly he handled COVID.  Recall that he was desperately trying to start a war in Iran, because wartime presidents usually get re-elected.  Then along comes this health crisis in China, which has the makings of a global pandemic.  He doesn't want his supporters to believe America could be vulnerable to such a crisis, because it would look bad for him, so he denies how serious it is, and continues to do so well after COVID started flourishing in America.  Because he doesn't want to admit he's wrong, he keeps underplaying the virus, comparing it to a cold, offering ""easy"" ways to get rid of it (ivermectin, anyone?), and encourages people to live their lives as normal.  Meanwhile, New York has shipping containers full of corpses and every other world health authority is imposing restrictions to limit the spread.  But the thing is, if Trump had taken swift, decisive action as soon as COVID became a threat in America, he could have reaped all the benefits of being a wartime president without actually having to fight a war.  He wouldn't have even had to admit that he was wrong, because his base is so enthralled that they would have forgotten all about his previous statements.    He could have swayed the moderates with leadership without the bad optics of sending Americans to the Middle East to die pointlessly, but because his ego's so unbelievably fragile, he instead dithered around while the most vulnerable Americans died preventable deaths.",iner22,2025-05-01T09:12:21,1

None of which is to disagree with your point. Drumpf has been a carnival barker for at least 40 years now and he truly does know how to play to the room. My preference is that someday his ""room"" consists of a concrete bed, a metal chair bolted to the floor, and several feet of walking space. But until then, yes, people will laugh at what he says because people have been trained to treat everything- even the Presidency- as a reality show.   In Drumpf's case, it's a TV show.

"You know just like the rest of us this is his playbook.  And it is also the Republican playbook.  And has been for a long time.  Going back to Bush the 2nd.  Well, he ran on the Clinton surplus.  They talked it up and how it would allow him to cut taxes.  Though never mentioning it was on the wealthy mostly.  At that point, they use that.  But then, they also lied and blamed Clinton for the debt that grew from the Reagan-Bush era.  Then, after the recession they blamed Obama for all the debt that had built.  And blamed him the entire time for the massive interest that debt had.    When this is done Trump will have made a mess.  It takes time for things in an economy.  Generally a 3-5 year period for the U.S.  But the tariffs are something that could speed that up drastically.  People will cut spending where they can.  And this will mean more lost jobs.  That is the proverbial snowball that has to hit the bottom.    In the end Democrats win mid-term and 2028.  They will absolutely take all the blame for the mess that will be much worse by then.  Even with the Bush recession i heard people that lost their jobs pre-Obama talk about it being Obama's fault.  Blaming him for having to wait until late 2009 or early 2010 for a job.  Things like that.  Gas was over $4 hear and much higher in 2008.  I have family that tells me ""It was $1.75 or close when Bush left office.""

He doesn't know any better, he never matured beyond the fantasies of a 5 year old being able to buy all the toys he wanted.  Imagine it. Donnie jr's first step as a baby. Rather than beaming with delight like any normal father, he'd immediately have to stand up and take two more steps than his son, just to prove he's the best walker. That's assuming he was present at all at the time, and not off somewhere cheating at golf. Something he clearly only does because he knows it's something people enjoy doing. He doesn't derive any pleasure from it himself. If he did, he'd work at improving. But he'd rather just have everyone around him pretend he's a great golfer. He's derived zero actual satisfaction from the game.  Look at the way he dances. Those are the movements of someone who's dimly aware that there is such a thing as dancing, and that it's moving about when there's music playing. He's never actually felt moved enough by music to dance.   He can't even smile properly. Try and find a picture of him smiling where he looks like anything other than someone who just smelled a fart.

Understanding that it is a learned tactic is something that I think is important to understand so we can correlate it to Roy Cohn when people think it’s a unique type of personality and unique to Trump, it’s not. What he also learned is public perception is all that matters, not facts and truth / law.  And to be clear - he is a narcissist psychopath, I’m not denying that. Im just saying by doing the 3 points above, it goes far beyond narcissism and is a tactic to change the reality around him and public perception - and obviously it has worked for him his whole career, which requires a narcissistic psychopath to successfully pull off.

I just personally don’t believe that he truly thinks he’s never wrong, he just can’t admit it to anyone or that’s a sign of weakness, so over the decades he’s learned how to hone these skills in with the help of Roy Cohn’s template.  He’s also charismatic, for better or worse, which makes me think he understands people generally and public perception so for him to be totally unaware of what he’s doing I think is just incorrect.  I just hate how people call him a dumb narcissist, while at the same time he’s able to convince half the country he’s a brilliant 8=D chess player. His tactics work and a straight narcissist couldn’t do that, but a charismatic one with specific rules of “how to be a strongman” make more sense. So I don’t think he’s very dumb when it comes to people and public perception, it’s the economics, “it’s computer”, and other areas of “expertise” that he’s rightfully called out as being an idiot for but simply denying something doesn’t exist is actually “smart” simply because it works.  I guess what I’m saying is him always denying things is not a sign of being an idiot, but it’s the actual content of why he’s wrong is why he’s an idiot lol.",kinsm4n,2025-05-01T17:34:22,1

So there absolutely is a need for a hearing to determine if he really is a MS13 gang member because proving that is necessary in order to determine if the AEA order applies to him.

The judge's ruling of withholding of removal was legal.  ICE never challenged or appealed this ruling.    The executive branch decided to override the judge's ruling on its own, based on zero new crimes or evidence.  They even admitted it was ""administrative error"".   Garcia actually only had a withholding from removal to El Salvador. He could've been deported to literally any other country that agreed to except him, but they oddly chose the one country a judge explicitly ruled he could not be sent to.   The issue at hand is that he was indeed here legally, and the executive branch overrode a judge's previous ruling, seemingly for no reason, admittedly in error, with no due process.",iceflame1211,2025-05-01T11:06:44,5

"> the individual is deemed dangerous  It's kind of the crux of the problem (amongst many many other problems).  Who is doing the deeming and what are they basing it on?  This seems like the last place in they world you would want to rely on ready-fire-aim tactics but that's exactly what they're doing.  Pretty much any person on US soil is now in danger of being targeted with this.  Odds start to go way up when you filter for skin color, any semblance of criminal record and locale.",MAG7C,2025-05-01T11:46:04,7

"Appreciate the anecdote, but *strongly* disagree.     The fact the president is actually delusional and/or idiotic and will have an emotional meltdown if challenged on basic demonstrable facts  _IS_ the story.   If that's your president, then why the fuck would you care what he thinks about Ukraine or anything else??????   There is absolutely no point in moving on if that's who you are speaking to.      This is like if he said he was getting his trade advice from a gnome that lives in his shoe and instead of saying ""you are going to have to show us this gnome, take off your shoe"" the reporter is like ""Oh shit... uh... well it's disputed whether or not gnomes exist.  Let's move on and talk about Ukraine...""    He 100% did this to help Trump.   It's sane-washing of the highest order.  >  I could have continued to hammer him point after point until he chose to retire, but what's the point of that?  BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR JOB.  The fact that we think a journalist interviewing a president is less like a lawyer cross-examining a witness and more like a _friendly game of fucking pickleball_ is a great analogy for how we ended up in this mess.",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-05-01T09:09:51,9

Agreed. It's a bad faith and racist argument by the Trump administration; they're basically labeling all immigrants as dangerous solely to deport with no due process.,iceflame1211,2025-05-01T12:06:02,3

"Thankfully unless it is a herding dog, they generally lose most of their unique puppy energy after two years of time in people age. Sadly a pair of shoes or two will probably get sacrificed on sharp puppy teeth, I guess you take the good with the bad. Just be careful if they get strangely food aggressive over cheese and broccoli, the farts that are produced are eye watering to say the least.",barontaint,2025-05-01T08:43:39,2

"This guy might have some Crack Russell in his background - he can *jump*. He’ll probably be around 20lbs and he’s super smart and energetic. He’s a Yorkie and… ? I have to take him outside and tire him out for my own sake. 😂 I adopted him at 4.5 months - I’m his 3rd human mom because he was too wild for his first and second owners. He’s been in puppy boot camp, always with a leash on and never unsupervised, so I’m tired, boss - but he learns fast!  I lost all 3 of my senior dogs in December, so he’s really been salve on the wound. 😍  https://i.imgur.com/5U2i80v.jpeg",70ms,2025-05-01T10:38:46,1

"Oh, he can make it onto the bed in a single bound - he’s just not allowed up there until I can be sure he won’t pee on it (again). 😜 He can jump straight up high enough to see onto the kitchen counters. His favorite toy is a flirt pole and he’s an aerial acrobat. I’m going to pick up some agility stuff because I think he’d really like it, and I wish we had room in the yard for frisbee, I can tell he’d be a frisbee dog!   Have you watched [2073](https://youtu.be/EiSXOR_A_3M) yet? I just saw it the other day and it shook me but apparently I didn’t take the lesson. Now I’m watching the AP’s Los Angeles Mayday Protest stream on YouTube, and wondering why the fuck I didn’t try harder to be there today.",70ms,2025-05-01T11:48:23,1
