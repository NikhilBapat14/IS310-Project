Do these people ever read a book. This type of fascist dictatorship crap doesn't end well for the people involved. Lots of examples from history show that. Nevermind the economic collapse that occurred along with the transition to a monopolistic dictatorship. I mean the path is pretty well laid out. Their people usually don't get to retire happy. Usually their families join them. Have they not realized that is their likely future?,Stonkasaurus1,2025-04-30T20:14:06,208

"She promised the president and the entire cabinet that as long as she had any power, none of them would be arrested for ANYTHING.   Why did it take 7 hours for me to hear this news? I watched the news and checked the headlines, and I found out about this on freaking reddit. I already know the answer. It's because there were so many outrageous things said by everyone, including the ~~village idiot~~ president, that there wasn't enough room in the headlines to cover the fact that THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES TOLD THE PRESIDENT AND THE ENTIRE FUCKING CABINET TO GO COMMIT ALL THE CRIMES THEY WANT AND SHE WILL PROTECT THEM.   Why are these people not in a cell awaiting trial? I already know the answer to this one, too. The judiciary relies on the executive for enforcement and the executive is the fucking problem.

"I mean we widely accept the claim that roughly 25% of the prison population have ""psychopathy"" as an inborn flaw which they can never overcome even though there is no proof that this is true and it is officially recognized as treatable ASPD by mental health professionals, so it is really not a stretch to make a claim that 100% of billionaires with increasing wealth have treatable ASPD. It is not a new or unique disorder, it is just the unflattering truth that antisocial personality is the sole reason for the unending accumulation of wealth beyond what is needed for personal well being, and the fourth most prevalent reason for incarceration.  Folks who accumulate wealth to empower their good intentions generally hit a wall before they are anywhere near being labeled the richest member of a society. Just like anyone who suffers from ASPD, it is possible for any billionaire to be cured, but they will then begin losing rather than accumulating wealth as they invest in others. Musk may not be a psychopath today or tomorrow, but he sure as hell has been a psychopath in the past as it is a necessary MO in order to be competitive enough to see his level of success.  I truly believe that the 1% are deserving of compassion and forgiveness in so far as they are willing to admit they have had a problem and commit to investing in the greater good of humanity. Behavioral health issues are never absolutely immutable, and billionaires today have the opportunity to change the world for the better and go down in history as good people regardless of the harm they caused in the past, all they need to do is change their MO moving forward.  TBH, the biggest impediment to a humanitarian revolution is the fact that American culture is obsessed with condemning people for their past criminality in spite of the fact that doing so necessarily prevents them from making amends and paying back their debt to society. We need to stop demanding punishment of criminals and billionaires and start rewarding everyone who takes the initiative to correct their past mistakes.   Every citizen of a ""free country"" must be afforded the agency to improve themselves in as far as they do not do so at the expense of others. It is truly un American to demand revenge against those who harm others when we can simply take their agency to harm others and demand that they do better from here on out.   For all those who think this current administration is legitimate, and those who believe it would be just to fight fire with fire, I just want you to know that we are all the authors of our own misery and no one else's, and the moment we forget this fact is the moment we choose violence and injustice over peace and prosperity for the collective.  The choice is ours, choose wisely or suffer the consequences of hubris. We need to assure these ghouls that they can be forgiven, but only if they are willing to step down peacefully, otherwise... WELCOME TO THE SEVENTH CIRCLE!

"Historically I think this may be the first time that one third of the US sincerely wants to eradicate another third of the US and the final third wants to watch.  Edit: i think I should elaborate a bit.   30 years ago, if an administration ordered every single Democrat and resistance leader rounded up and shot on the Washington Mall, nearly every single American would have opposed that. Our government was held in check by the fact that those kinds of actions would be near universally opposed. What Trump's administration is betting on now is the novel idea that in fact, at least their supporters are in full support of mass executions, and everyone else will be too afraid of their own neighbors to stand up and do something about it.  That's one reason why massacres as a means of population control are possible now where they weren't before. The other reason is AI automation.  If you are tech bros and would be oligarchs seizing absolute power at the very moment where AGI and lesser LLMs are about to revolutionize work, eliminating the need for most administrative, customer service, programming, writing, designing, and communications jobs, when you are simultaneously standing up multipurpose robotics to handle manual tasks, and you and your buddies are all the direct capital owners of these *new means of production*, then what do you do with the *old* means of production?

"I guess a simpler way to convey this is to say that a dictator is only powerful if they can persuade people to do their bidding.   We should shock and awe these creeps into respecting the dignity of others by being the change we want to see in the world.   If all people understand that we can trust one another to cooperate in seeking solutions that will only serve the greater good of all, we have no reason to fear other people, and if we have no reason to fear other people, we have nothing to gain from harming them.  People like Trump and Musk know we have every right to punish them, and so they seek power so that they can defend themselves. It is high time that we tell these people that they can surrender without being killed or abused by those they have wronged. They should have access to healthcare, housing, and freedom from cruelty, as should all humans. Nobody should be condemned.   Think about how Israel claims that genocide is necessary, what if the rest of the world simply relieved them of their power and proved that all Palestine wants is equality and freedom from oppression and forced removal from their homes. Same with Iran, really these are in fact weaker nations that suffer from the abuse of power at the hands of a group who holds a persecution complex, of course Arabs are going to respond to being abused by saying they want to wipe Israel off the map, but if Israel actually treated the rest of the middle east fairly, they would not be in any danger.

"These things are almost always still branching off of things that are.  I have known a lot of cops and criminals in my life, and they are generally cut out of the same trauma stained cloth. Part of the process that yields a persecution complex is the pseudo gaslighting that happens when we attempt to kindly remind people that something is not as bad as they are making it out to be.  My pops watches a lot of movies and TV shows and he will literally tell you the whole story whether you are interested or not because the boob tube is his life these days. Sometimes I wonder if folks are so traumatized by watching Tuco on Breaking Bad that they think all Mexicans are like that. At the same time I realize that a lot of them are older than I am, and they lived and worked in places and times where crime was a bigger problem than it is today.   At one point in their life they likely have had an incredibly traumatic experience with a POC and this will necessarily distort their grasp on reality. It goes both ways too, I know racism is power plus prejudice, but I will be damned if I have not felt the hate from POC who do not even know me, all I can figure is they were once traumatized by a man that looks or sounds like I do.  Basically what I am saying is that these people are mentally ill, and if we are going to be true to our liberal ideology, we cannot treat them as if they are simply being cruel for the sake of being cruel. They literally believe that all Arabs are terrorists, all immigrants are criminals or threats to national security, they think that socialism is evil but they proudly serve in the armed forces or law enforcement and are technically socialists because of this. They expect their social security and medicare to be there for them, and they certainly benefit from tax revenue. The only logical reason that I can think of as to why they support Trump is that they are mentally ill to a degree that reinforces and rewards ignorance.   So with this in mind, I cannot see why the best course of action is to be kind, generous, honorable, and simply prove that we are not a threat through actions rather than attempting to debate. The truth is, both sides are heated at this point, and I have to check myself because it is all too easy to lob insults and lash out at these folks when it is clear that they cannot be persuaded through debate. I'm going to start trying to be nicer and find common ground in simplicity, hopefully Trump will expose his true nature enough that the people I demonstrate humanity to will realize that I am a better ally than some scumbag who plays golf on the taxpayer dollar after he doubles the cost of living for all Americans and careens toward WW3 after promising ""no new wars.""",Gullible-Minute-9482,2025-05-01T16:50:00,1

The cruelty I see in Trump supporters is most often just a thinly veiled self pity/loathing disguised as narcissism. Projection is easier than facing your own demons.

He is also a sexual predator. Trump is so desperate to be loved and respected by everyone that he cannot tolerate the notion that he is not worthy. His most ""irredeemable"" supporters are just like him and that is why they love seeing him fuck shit up and abuse power against people who make them feel inferior.

Hitler was not good enough to be an artist, but he wanted to be an artist. Some folks just see fascism as the ultimate revenge against a society that they have come to blame all of their problems on. Fascism never requires those in power to prove or justify anything, it allows them absolute freedom to bend others to suit their arbitrary and capricious orders. There is no need for merit when they have power over others.  Fascists never win. They always get royally fucked in the end. There is the proverb that says a dictator rides upon the back of a beast which they cannot control. These folks are nihilists and they want us to respond in kind. Perhaps they lack the ability to commit suicide so they figure war is the only way out. Any way you parse it, the only way to defeat fascism is to kill it with kindness. It never went away after WW2, indeed, the victims of that Holocaust are arguably the biggest fascists today and fascism has in fact been brewing under the surface in America ever since Japan surrendered.",Gullible-Minute-9482,2025-05-01T19:16:35,2
