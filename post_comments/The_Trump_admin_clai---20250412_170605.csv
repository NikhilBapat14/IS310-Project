"And yet he is under zero charges from the country of El Salvador that would hold him in containment. He is kidnapped to El Salvador, held in a facility currently being funded by the United States (1), therefor not under the ""sovereign"" authority of El Salvador, but of a mix of El Salvadorian and United States authority. Additionally, this man has been kidnapped, not imprisoned, under a wartime law that can only be invoked under very strict conditions, none of which has been met in this case.  This goes past a war crime, this is an actual state sponsored kidnapping of a man on United States soil. This is their test case to see if they can do this to anyone they want.      1: (https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pay-el-salvador-jail-300-alleged-gang-members-ap-reports-2025-03-15/",annaleigh13,2025-04-12T17:17:51,332

This still doesn't satisfy the order. I imagine some attorneys are going to start having their certifications taken away for not following court orders and skating these things.   A bunch of people were abducted off the streets and sent to a terrorist camp with no due process.
