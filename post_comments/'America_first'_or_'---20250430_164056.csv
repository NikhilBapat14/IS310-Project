"Dont bother clicking the link, you already know the reason why. He wants us to have no allies to come in and save the country when he enacts martial law and overthrows the Democracy.  I keep hearing Democratic leadership say ""we are fighting and we are winning!"" - but they are not winning anything.  Trump thumbed his nose at the SCOTUS, and has started having other judges arrested on federal charges of interference.  Congress, the cowardly bastards, refuses to step up and do anything.   The absolute worst outcome that could have happened the last election cycle, happened because 1/3 of Americans are too damn lazy to stand in a line for 15 minutes to go vote, or even for 3 hours.  Most people do not have to wait for hours to vote, it is between 15-30 minutes in cities with around 120,000 people.   Yes, I still think Elon did something to change the outcome of the election and, no, I do not think we will ever hear how he did it.  But, he got what he wanted, played his part, and left.
