"EITC is Welfare. You not only don't have to pay federal income tax, you still get the deductions as a ""refund""",AppState1981,2025-05-09T09:15:56,15
The thing with this guy is he always calls out problems but never talks about solutions. He did the same thing in [NR](https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-must-go/) just yesterday in arguing that the CFPB must go. Ask him what his idea of reform looks like and you never get a straight answer.,zip117,2025-05-09T12:03:59,14
Dude does not understand macroeconomics.  Taxation isn't about collecting revenue but about destroying excess money.  The government can literally create the money it needs ex nihilo.,Lord_Elsydeon,2025-05-09T07:56:04,-24
"At least EITC doesn’t wholly disincentivize working, though.   I want entitlement spending cut, but we have to acknowledge some forms of welfare are better than others.",slagathor_zimblebob,2025-05-09T14:12:44,9
He sort of does give a few proposals in the last two paragraphs.    1. Just clarify those refundable credits as welfare so we can better assess how reasonable the total amounts are in the budget.    2. Push more welfare to the states rather than the federal government because states have to be more fiscally responsible than the federal government. Makes no sense to print money to pay welfare.,Key_Bored_Whorier,2025-05-09T12:26:41,10
Yeah he is like a Democrat that way.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T12:11:45,2
It doesn’t work that way. The goodies create anything so it can’t create wealth or money. It has to take money from you and me.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-09T08:29:37,17
"Yeah, sort of. And he says “the states are only paying 10 percent of many of the people on Medicaid” which is only valid if you notice he said “many of” because in reality states are already paying upwards of 30 percent of the total cost of Medicaid, but this varies significantly state-to-state. They should be paying more absolutely, but Rand has a history of making these evasive arguments.",zip117,2025-05-09T12:37:17,3
