"Enough of the GOP seems to agree with him, and they are going to burn down the economy because Trump, who barely won the last election, and is polling in the gutter, erroneously thinks he has a mandate to destroy the government and the economy based on his ignorance of almost every economic principle.",thepartypantser,2025-05-09T23:31:20,87

"I would say it's democrats who are in denial. We know conservatives will eat shit just to have a liberal smell it. They don't have the burden of caring about outcomes. We do, and we are pretending that the conservatives will ever come back to earth. No, I'd say we are gaslighting ourselves plenty well.",ShoppingDismal3864,2025-05-09T23:54:55,6
"That's not how that works.  If you are a good person in their position and you think you can do something about it, you would try to do something. If you are a good person in their position and you think you can't, you quit the party and whatever office you hold in its name. They have done neither. The conclusion is therefore obvious.  They're not in denial. They're too cowardly and self-interested to stop him from doing anything, no matter how insane, The denial is bad faith, an attempt to pretend that they don't know or can't do anything about it, whereas in reality they are complicit in everything Trump does. They still enable, support and identify with him.",barryvm,2025-05-10T03:53:32,2
"I think the even bigger problem is that the China isn’t bluffing, either!  Their goals are longer term than Trump’s: they want the US to destabilize and for the entire world to see the consequences of restricting trade with China.  For that long term goal to work, the US has to suffer.    The US centric view is that when Trump eventually folds, that China will revert to the way things were.  I think that misunderstands the human nature of China’ government and businesses.    From today’s Washington Post, there was a Chinese business owner that rejected a recent order for 5,000 flip flops.  She said, I don’t want to work with the US anymore.  She’d rather have less business from more stable countries.    In that sense, I don’t think it matters much whether Trump is bluffing or not … China isn’t bluffing, and the game doesn’t end until it says it ends.",CryptographerNew3609,2025-05-10T05:20:05,2

Crunch time is looming and his MAGA base will take a kicking. Con men usually have an alias and an exit strategy for when the jig is up or resort to bankruptcy. Donny Two Shoes has nowhere to run and hide.  Trump could face the crumbling of MAGA and its anger should it start to groggily wake up from the mass delusion.   It could , despite its apparent rock hard devotion , wake up to itself in such numbers that it turns on him.

"Guys, I think you’re maybe misunderstanding the situation here. Trump is driving towards the outcome that his supporters ultimately want.  They want to preserve their conservative way of life. They want to enforce their family, religious, and moral views on the rest of the country. They want to see their single issues defended. They want to own the libs. This is all a means to that end, and I’m convinced that many conservatives are willing to suffer in order to achieve that end.  This is all about restructuring how power works in America.  Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to abolish the IRS and eliminate the income tax. That would require either a repeal or rewrite of Title 26 of the U.S. Code or repeal the 16th Amendment…a nearly impossible task. But he doesn’t need to repeal it if he can defund and disable the system it created.  And that seems to be the strategy.  The IRS is already weakened. Through appointments, budget constraints, and policy manipulation, it can be further gutted…making it harder for Congress to fund federal programs. If income tax enforcement collapses, Congress’s control over fiscal policy erodes.  At the same time, Trump is pushing tariffs…“external revenue” collected by Customs and Border Protection under DHS. While Congress officially sets tariffs, presidents now wield considerable authority under national security pretexts. If CBP becomes a revenue arm of the executive, and Congress fails to respond, this becomes a quiet shift of fiscal power to the presidency.  Just watch when Trump announces the creation of the “External Revenue Service” in the coming days.  The tariffs are a means to an end, and having a complicit Fed chairman will help offset the economic shit storm set off by the tariffs. I feel fairly confident that they paused the tariffs just long enough to replace Powell so they can drop interest rates as an offset to economic slowdown when they go back to fully reinforcing the tariffs.  In this scenario, lowering interest rates may not even ignite inflation given the economic headwinds the country will face due to the tariffs.  Consider two facts:  1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Trumps expanded 232 and 301 tariffs from 2018 were never lowered or repealed after he put em into effect seven years ago. 2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠His “negotiations” with Canada and Mexico over fentanyl and immigration were largely a farce, and he put tariffs in place anyway.  So if I’m right, the negotiations are largely performative while they figure out how to handle Powell and the bond markets. They want the tariffs in place.  So let’s keep going….  Legally, the Constitution remains. Functionally, its balance of power tilts.  A lot.  The conservatives hold the purse.  With both chambers of Congress under Republican control, opposition is unlikely. Checks and balances don’t work without political will. And this moment is revealing just how conditional that will can be.  But that still doesn’t answer the deeper question…Why is this happening now?  Demographic trends show steady growth in ethnic minority populations…many of whom have historically leaned Democratic. That creates a long-term challenge for conservatives and the Republican Party, which has relied heavily on white, rural, and religious voters as its very committed base.  For some factions within the Republican coalition…particularly Christian nationalists and others motivated by single-issue politics around abortion, gun rights, racism, religious freedom, anti-vaccine, or LGBTQ+ issues…this demographic shift toward minorities (I.e. liberals) is seen as an existential threat. As the Democrat-leaning population grows, it simply becomes a numbers game.  Democrats won the popular vote in 4 of the last 5 presidential elections, and only narrowly lost last year due to low minority turnout.  That’s why simultaneously immigration becomes such a hot button topic …it’s not a coincidence. Republicans understand that immigration accelerates the demographic trend. That’s why voter suppression and gerrymandering are equally wielded…they’re tools to blunt the demographic shift.  So how does the Republican block survive all this?  Easy….change the game.  A strong “dictator” executive isn’t feared by conservatives…it’s embraced. Because in the face of a long-term political disadvantage, concentrated power becomes a survival strategy. A necessary chess move to retain influence and control.  Wielding executive orders, government agencies, and the ability to influence the legal system by appointing federal judges and Supreme Court members, supplemented by moving the power of the purse from Congress to the executive branch, the president is able to overcome the demographic shift and effectively take Congress…the people…out of the equation. As long as they can retain the presidency using all the tactics we’ve seen, conservatives can control the country.  And that’s ultimately what they want…control.  Now to Powell.  Lowering interest rates would make sense in the face of an economic downturn caused by these tariffs fully going into effect.  CBP collections would also increase significantly with the tariffs in full effect.  One thing I didn’t mention is that it’s very likely that the entitlement programs would continue to route through the IRS as normal payroll tax collections. The reason this can be allowed is because Congress can’t wield this with any power.  The money is already spoken for.  The tariffs can also be augmented by other fees… Note the ship docking fees that just went into place today.  Expect to see more energy related fees, federal fees for things like passports, communication and technology fees through the FCC, higher financial filing and transaction fees, public land and resource use fees, and aviation related fees. And now we have tariffs on movies in case these other avenues don’t generate enough money. Put all this together along with significantly shrinking the overall size and scope of the government, and you get much closer to something that can work. I’m not saying it makes sense.  I’m not saying the rest of the world will play along.  But there’s a certain rationale to what they’re doing.  If we keep watching only the market reaction to tariffs and other distractions like deportations, we’ll miss the real transformation happening right in front of us.  EDIT: Aaaand last week he announced the External Revenue Service as I predicted weeks ago.  https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/s/8W0PQWazqD  EDIT: Aaaaand here is now an attempt to get the judiciary under the control of the executive and further weaken congress.

"There is a good argument that simply having trade deficits is normal and not economically important.  Further, that “fixing” the trade deficits we have been running for decades is not urgent.  And finally, if it was urgent and important then it is a major problem that Congress cannot delegate.  In other words, Trump tariffs are both illegal and unconstitutional.    The courts may soon rule them out of existence, and direct Trump to seek legislation in Congress if he still thinks they are important. I think this possibility is the main reason the stock market hasn’t completely collapsed.",guttanzer,2025-05-10T09:52:44,3
"This is a very good write up.  My only note and it’s not a criticism or disagreement necessarily, is that while I think a lot of conservatives would be okay with the idea of “suffering for the cause” on paper, I think in reality, they won’t bear it so well, particularly because you have no way of knowing its worth it. For all the doom and gloom, which is warranted to a degree, I think Trump hasn’t been as successful as the people involved have hoped.   One of the glaring issues that’s always been present is that while Republicans want their way of life to dominate, many of them also genuinely want to be successful and for liberals to suffer. The problem is, liberals heavily comprise the white collar class/Intelligentsia. Their skills are more valuable in the modern computerized world overall. Even if they wanted to, you couldn’t just replace all those people with conservatives. And you never likely never will as red states destroy their own education systems and indoctrinate their own.   Things may get much worse, but there won’t be a class repositioning. Middle class liberals will still be the middle class, just poorer than before. The working poor will probably be dirt poor. The gap between city and country will grow.   Frankly I don’t think they have the time and I don’t think Trump has the balls.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-10T00:11:36,11

Two issues with your analysis.    First:  The Fed only controls the overnight rate.  The overnight rate does not set the cost of borrowing it is the bond market that does that.  Any move against the Fed is going to tank the bond market.  Second:   Tariffs as a revenue source is self defeating.  Anything that can be reshored will be reshored eventually greatly reducing Tariffs as a revenue source.   What will be left is Tariffs on things that the US cannot produce which is a small subset of all goods.  Both of these things will make Americans much poorer.  They will pay more to finance their lives and they will pay more for the goods and services they consume.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-10T01:11:50,3

"I also think they misjudge how long their base will hold on. It’s one thing to blame every negative thing on Biden when the economy is rolling. That’s an easy sell. But when people start losing their jobs, health care, retirement, and general quality of life, I think people are going to regret the contract they signed with this conman. At some point, the only person left to point to will be the despot at the heart of these disastrous decisions. And just like any other cult, when the rats start exiting the ship, it starts to happen all at once. But it’s pain that will bring us there, completely unavailable catastrophic pain.  I also want to say, and this is for the commenter who wrote the long post, the kidnapping and human trafficking of legal residents is not a distraction. It’s part and parcel of the move towards fascism. We should not broadcast to others that violating the constitution and the invocation of cruel and unusual punishment is ever a distraction.
