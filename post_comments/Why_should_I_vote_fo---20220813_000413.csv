"Because if other people thought the way you did, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. You have to assume your vote counts or you run the risk that too many people don’t vote, regardless of where they live.",tysontysontyson1,2022-08-13T17:27:05,12
"Your voice needs to be heard. Elections are not about winning. Let no one fool you otherwise. This year it may be 80/20. Next election 60/40, and then the next thing you know, it's 40/60 and 20/80 because people like you stand their ground and keep being heard. That's what it's about... Your voice being heard and doing your civic duty. Might not seem like it, but many have sacrificed their life so you can vote ... Remember that.",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-13T18:15:23,8
"So your right; voting for a Democrat in a statewide election in LA is unlikely to change things. But it also doesn't really cost you anything, and you never know.   However, I will say that voting alone really doe nothing. The people who really have a say in our democracy (who aren't buying their way in) are the people who do much more than voting, the people who organize. Ten years ago, Georgia was almost as solidly read as LA, but thanks to Democrats organizing, they turned it into a purple state. Florida is a hard red state these days, but just a few years ago, voters approved re-enfranchising felons and raising the minimum wage. Just because one vote isn't really going to do anything doesn't mean there is nothing you can do.",loselyconscious,2022-08-13T21:59:28,3
"Because it’s simply another box to mark on the ballot, and doesn’t harm anyone else directly by voting for a losing candidate in your state.",Zeddo52SD,2022-08-13T17:54:51,2
"Last year, Georgia, one of the deepest southern states there is in an era of increasing political polarity, went blue. In 2016, Hillary Clinton was expected to easily sweep her way to victory because of the ""great wall of blue"" that included the Great Lakes states. Trump won Michigan and others to eventually win the race.  Election outcomes are NOT predetermined. Sure, folks have been saying Texas has a chance to go blue this year for what seems like 15 years, but the point that Texas's margin is becoming slimmer and slimmer isn't wrong. The electoral college works on a winner take all system, but that obscures how close a race really can be in a given state.  So yeah, Louisiana is pretty darn red, and it looks like it will stay that way. But the only way that will ever change is if folks like yourself vote. You literally can't hope for a different electoral outcome if you never, ever vote for it. And if you start to force states like yours to be closer and closer races, 100% that's something the parties care about.  Put another way, if Louisiana is a deep red state and wins every statewide election by 10+ points every single year, and the margin never moves, then OF COURSE the parties will just keep doing what they are doing. It's either working or not working so well that the Reps and Dems, respectively, have no incentive to do anything differently. Voters are happy with the status quo, and if they're not, they're not telling the parties that.  But if Louisiana instead has a trend of an increasingly narrow margin over the last several cycles, then that shows there is room for change. It shows that Dems are willing to work to increase their constituency and fight for voters. It shows that Reps are having trouble maintaining their advantage with their current policies.   Parties pay attention to the margins way more than you realize. In some ways, that is the ONLY useful information parties can get from electoral outcomes. If you withhold that information, then you're telling the parties that you don't really care about what happens enough to fight for it.",mormagils,2022-08-15T09:43:16,2
"Why should you vote if the state consistently voted *for* your party of choice? If the state goes 3 million for Trump and 2 million for Biden, your vote was equally irrelevant to the final outcome whether you voted for Trump or Biden.",cpast,2022-08-13T21:39:09,1
"The important thing is to vote. Perhaps your vote for President ""doesn't matter"" in the general scheme of things, but your vote for school board does. And the more people who vote, the more things actually do change. Only about half the people who could vote actually do. It is vitally important that more people vote.",DemocraticFederalist,2022-08-14T11:40:17,1
"A few years back a lot of Democrats stayed home because they were sure Hillary was going to win anyway.   Hopefully, we learned our lesson. Everyone has a responsibility to vote.  It is critical.",joyfullypresent,2022-08-14T18:18:56,1
"Y’all still got a primary to vote for though. Your primary votes are big indicators for pundits and analysts on how conservative states opine on progressivism or moderate views on democratic candidates. Also, your views can be expressed more and more in presidential elections as more and more states are currently changing their swing-status. States like Iowa used to be pretty swing but now vote more reliably for red candidates. We also analyze votes on congressional districts and counties to understand how cities or even rural counties interpret candidates. Even if it seems like the whole country isn’t caring about your vote, the people behind the scenes do and pay attention very closely to any possible change",QueasyMilhouse,2022-08-16T19:48:57,1
"To let your state leaders know that it's constituents believe as you do to a greater extent. If they believe that everyone agrees with them, then they'll be more aggressive at instituting policies they like. Whereas they'll be less aggressive if they know their views may cost them reelection.",rogun64,2022-08-17T04:25:47,1
"A little late to this post, but there are additional factors that no one mentioned.  1) Many opinion polls, especially around election time are restricted to ""voters"", ""likely voters"", and ""registered voters"".  If you (and by extension everyone who shares your opinion) stops voting, you are also removing yourself from these opinion polls which often times shape how politicians make their decisions.   2) Political parties aren't looking at just the win/loss and a general margin of victory, they are breaking down every number they can to prepare for the next election, to determine who they put up for election next time, and how to craft their message.  Did their message this election cycle make the margin of victory smaller?  Did certain groups stop supporting certain candidates? Did advertisements keep certain voters home or bring them out?  The very action of you voting or not voting is a big deal. Winning by 20 vs 18 can be a huge deal if it meant losing most of the young vote, or the older vote, etc.  In short, your vote DOES MATTER and you should exercise your vote whenever you can.",glov0044,2022-08-28T12:33:43,1
"This doesn't make mathematical sense.  If you have a state with 1,000 voters (just for the sake of round numbers,) and 800 of them are Republican voters with 200 being Democrat voters, even if the Democrat voters achieve a 100% turnout, a 30% turnout by Republican voters will easily crush the Democrat voters.  So if you're a Democrat voter in that situation, what's the value in voting? There's no amount of turnout that's going to secure you electoral success.",HeloRising,2022-08-18T05:41:14,0
"That’s both incorrect and missing the point. Do you know how many states have an 80/20 split on Presidential votes? Not a single one. Even states that consistently go red or blue, do so by fairly small margins.. that absolutely are impacted by apathetic non-voters. In any event, the point is the same. Unless you want your prediction to become self fulfilling, you need to act as you’d want others to act.",tysontysontyson1,2022-08-18T13:16:48,1
"Except, no, the ""swing"" seats for counties has been [dramatically dropping](https://www.cookpolitical.com/cook-pvi/introducing-2021-cook-political-report-partisan-voter-index) and county level victories are what make up state victories in the presidential election.  There is an objective hardening of political trends in the US such that fewer and fewer places have any meaningful chance to be impacted by a less apathetic voter base turnout",HeloRising,2022-08-20T06:39:35,0
"I didn’t say there wasn’t a trend towards more partisan voting. I said that there aren’t any states with an 80/20 split. That’s a fact. (To be fair, DC, although not a state, was skewed even more than 80/20 in 2020… but, it was the only jurisdiction that was). No other jurisdiction cracked 70/30 and most were a fair amount closer.  I’m not sure where you’re getting the idea that Presidential elections are decided at the county/district level. Just because that’s how they’re “called” sequentially doesn’t mean states give electoral votes based on county results.",tysontysontyson1,2022-08-20T11:51:23,1
