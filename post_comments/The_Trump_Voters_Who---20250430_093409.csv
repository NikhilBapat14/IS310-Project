"Someone should remake the movie 1984, but instead of making the country and its symbols so obviously Soviet Russia as they did in the original, make it look MAGA.  Edit: Trump's first 100 days filled with lies and contradictions of whatever he may have said before as MAGA maniacally cheers him on is classic 1984.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-30T09:36:16,17

"I think it's interesting how the people they interview for stories like this never seem to name specifics. It's always ""I like the things he's doing, not all of the things, but I like that he's doing things. We needed a president who wasn't afraid to do things.""   Hard to say if they're feeling an inkling of shame or if they don't have a fucking clue what he's doing.",pervocracy,2025-04-30T09:42:56,5

"These articles are as useless as the “this might be the last straw for Trump!!1! “ posts, and I personally found it distasteful that the author was like “I texted my close childhood friend who voted for Trump every time” like , you still consider that trash your friend ?   And not even a DM, they’re close enough for direct texts ?   I don’t fraternize with those people , much less text them.",ISeeYouNoThanks,2025-04-30T09:49:05,6

"If you needed to boil it down to core components, I think it’s people that aren’t capable of two things, empathy or developing their own personalities. It’s much easier to fulfill the human need to belong to a tribe by hanging a flag and wearing a hat than it is to be meaningfully introspective - which is also how you’d develop empathy.   I think there are a number of contributing factors that lead to someone being in this position. Some of it is just that a certain percentage of humans are going to be wired this way. Some of it is growing up in very homogenized communities with low-key authoritarian leaders at church, school, jobs, etc. And some of it is the fact that they feel angry about working hard but it never seeming to pan out the way they thought it would, or were told it would.   But without introspection, they cannot and will not question what they’re told by their tribe. And that need to belong is so strong, they can’t risk losing that status. ",johhnny5,2025-05-01T06:49:01,1

"""What's one thing in particular?""  ""Well, you know, like, um, he's not afraid to do things.""  This is the same mentality as Brexiteers in the UK. They love to say how Brexit has given us all these benefits that we didn't have while we were in the EU, but when pressed, can't name a single one. (There aren't any of any significance, unless you happen to be super rich or a disaster capitalist.)",paolog,2025-04-30T10:05:38,7

The flexible ones are the low-level power hungry sychophants that just want to be part of an in-group where they have at least some amount of status. ,johhnny5,2025-05-01T06:22:33,2
