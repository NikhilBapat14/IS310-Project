"From Semafor's Yinka Adegoke:  Bill Gates says he has been ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù at the cuts to global humanitarian aid programs by the US Trump administration and will be lobbying the White House and Congress to help restore some of the axed programs. In an interview with Semafor to mark the Gates Foundation‚Äôs 25th anniversary, Gates warned that the cuts will likely cost lives in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.  The billionaire philanthropist announced on Thursday that he now plans to give away ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù all his wealth over the next 20 years and sunset the foundation in 2045. Gates estimated that he will give away around $200 billion via the foundation in that time ‚Äî or twice the amount given away since the foundation was founded when he had significant support from fellow billionaire Warren Buffett.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still quite optimistic about what we can do in the next 20 years, even though I‚Äôm horrified about where we find ourselves with these aid reductions,‚Äù Gates told Semafor, referring to both the tens of billions of dollars in US foreign aid cuts and budget tightening by wealthy European nations. As part of the cuts, the Trump administration is shutting down USAID, the government‚Äôs primary development aid organization.  Gates said his decision to accelerate giving away his wealth was not related to the cuts and noted that it was unlikely even the Gates Foundation, which had an endowment of $77 billion at the end of 2023, could replicate the role of USAID.  ‚ÄúThe cuts in USAID are larger than what the Gates Foundation is able to provide. I look forward to a day that we get those USAID numbers back up again,‚Äù he said.

"""Gates Foundation was started by Gates and his former wife Melinda French Gates in 2000 to help reduce inequity in global health and in education in the United States. Since then the foundation has claimed success in helping to save millions of lives around the world from diseases including malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis with a range of initiatives including vaccine programs and over a hundred innovations.""  They helped bankroll Partners in Health turning the accepted way of treating MDR TB and then  AIDS on its head.  The WHO had to completely change their recommendations.  So, yes, the Gates Foundation has literally saved millions of lives for just these two diseases.

"Some of the more fascinating encounters I've had have been whenever I've suggested to wealthy people that their success has been attributed in any way to chance. Some folks will belligerently, doggedly insist that it was only their own choices and hard work--and, at least in my experience (albeit perhaps unsurprisingly), those folks are also the ones who are likely to be selfish, miserly, and arrogant. After all, if you think your success is entirely your own fault, it's not a long leap to conclude also that the failure of others must be due to their laziness, stupidity, or some other less-than-ness.  By contrast, some of the successful people I'm closest to will cheerfully volunteer that their successes were also largely a matter of chance. That understanding tends to make you humble and more compassionate, since the fortune that made you can just as easily unmake you. I know a great many people who struggle financially who are brilliant but whose ship just never came in despite their best efforts, or who used to be on an upward trajectory before a medical bill thwarted them, an investor backed out, or their industry evaporated. So much of life is beyond our control.  I think understanding the role that chance plays in success and failure is a kind of enlightenment. Once you see how little control you have on which opportunities you encounter and don't encounter, and which bets pay off and don't pay off, it's easy to want to provide those opportunities for others when you can, to be generous when you're ahead, and to extend a hand to others trying to climb alongside you.",xhieron,2025-05-09T08:06:32,1

If I were to organize this and wanted to get 10-11M people involved, I would be looking at ways to confirm individual registrations without actually storing personal data. Perhaps a multi-step verification process for registration, followed by a purge of the data used once verification is complete. Bad actors could create fake registrations, but they can do the same now, so that‚Äôs not a new risk. The point is really just to make it more difficult than a button click that increments a counter.
