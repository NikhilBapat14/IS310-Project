"From Semafor's Yinka Adegoke:  Bill Gates says he has been “horrified” at the cuts to global humanitarian aid programs by the US Trump administration and will be lobbying the White House and Congress to help restore some of the axed programs. In an interview with Semafor to mark the Gates Foundation’s 25th anniversary, Gates warned that the cuts will likely cost lives in some of the most vulnerable regions of the world.  The billionaire philanthropist announced on Thursday that he now plans to give away “virtually” all his wealth over the next 20 years and sunset the foundation in 2045. Gates estimated that he will give away around $200 billion via the foundation in that time — or twice the amount given away since the foundation was founded when he had significant support from fellow billionaire Warren Buffett.  “I’m still quite optimistic about what we can do in the next 20 years, even though I’m horrified about where we find ourselves with these aid reductions,” Gates told Semafor, referring to both the tens of billions of dollars in US foreign aid cuts and budget tightening by wealthy European nations. As part of the cuts, the Trump administration is shutting down USAID, the government’s primary development aid organization.  Gates said his decision to accelerate giving away his wealth was not related to the cuts and noted that it was unlikely even the Gates Foundation, which had an endowment of $77 billion at the end of 2023, could replicate the role of USAID.  “The cuts in USAID are larger than what the Gates Foundation is able to provide. I look forward to a day that we get those USAID numbers back up again,” he said.

"""Gates Foundation was started by Gates and his former wife Melinda French Gates in 2000 to help reduce inequity in global health and in education in the United States. Since then the foundation has claimed success in helping to save millions of lives around the world from diseases including malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis with a range of initiatives including vaccine programs and over a hundred innovations.""  They helped bankroll Partners in Health turning the accepted way of treating MDR TB and then  AIDS on its head.  The WHO had to completely change their recommendations.  So, yes, the Gates Foundation has literally saved millions of lives for just these two diseases.  And of course rumors and social media have to mess with their work:  ""Some of the most important work the Gates Foundation has done on the continent has been around vaccine promotion but it is also an area where the Bill Gates ‘brand’ has become tainted on African social media with conspiracy theories shared widely on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook about his true intentions with Africans. Those conspiracies really took hold around the global pandemic.  Gates said his team monitored the “wild talk” but seemed to recognize the challenge of “some man who has a lot of money who’s far away, does he have our best interests at heart?’” He said the foundation would continue to work with government leaders, civil society leaders and religious leaders to avoid rumors “\[getting\] out of control.”""",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-08T08:37:16,4

Yes.  -----  Raises a difficult question.  You could live your entire life being good, but have next to no impact on any sort of notable scale as a normal every day person.

Gates foundation and a few others are involved in a lot of different funding initiatives across a lot of different global health sectors. Over the decades they’ve come to rely on USA ID funding and expertise to fill gaps in sectors and to provide frameworks and tools for good practices that implementing partners in different countries could pick up and aim for with support from the gates foundations. It’s not well understood by many Americans how the death of USAID also ripples out and heavily impacts other organizations in philanthropies that are involved in delivering global aid and development support. The fact that USAID was pulverized with almost no warning is what really complicates things as these organizations didn’t have time to adapt.,flatandroid,2025-05-08T19:08:50,1

"Some of the more fascinating encounters I've had have been whenever I've suggested to wealthy people that their success has been attributed in any way to chance. Some folks will belligerently, doggedly insist that it was only their own choices and hard work--and, at least in my experience (albeit perhaps unsurprisingly), those folks are also the ones who are likely to be selfish, miserly, and arrogant. After all, if you think your success is entirely your own fault, it's not a long leap to conclude also that the failure of others must be due to their laziness, stupidity, or some other less-than-ness.  By contrast, some of the successful people I'm closest to will cheerfully volunteer that their successes were also largely a matter of chance. That understanding tends to make you humble and more compassionate, since the fortune that made you can just as easily unmake you. I know a great many people who struggle financially who are brilliant but whose ship just never came in despite their best efforts, or who used to be on an upward trajectory before a medical bill thwarted them, an investor backed out, or their industry evaporated. So much of life is beyond our control.  I think understanding the role that chance plays in success and failure is a kind of enlightenment. Once you see how little control you have on which opportunities you encounter and don't encounter, and which bets pay off and don't pay off, it's easy to want to provide those opportunities for others when you can, to be generous when you're ahead, and to extend a hand to others trying to climb alongside you.",xhieron,2025-05-09T08:06:32,1

"Well, recent protests have numbered in the millions without using this sort of sign-up.   They want to wait until they have enough people to begin taking action, which I can understand. The easiest way to do that — whilst ensuring no one is creating false sign-ups — is to collect personal data. But that comes with serious risks and will act as a deterrent to many.   If I were to organize this and wanted to get 10-11M people involved, I would be looking at ways to confirm individual registrations without actually storing personal data. Perhaps a multi-step verification process for registration, followed by a purge of the data used once verification is complete. Bad actors could create fake registrations, but they can do the same now, so that’s not a new risk. The point is really just to make it more difficult than a button click that increments a counter.   Perhaps create a registration code for each sign-up and then provide a card with that code to the individual upon completion, allowing them to download/print the card if they wish to have it for verification purposes later.",Emilia_Violet,2025-05-08T11:19:38,1
