Whether a trump believes in running in 2028 or not he would still be telling his supporters this. Hype up that he is running again and bombard them with desperate requests for 2028 campaign contributions probably to an even more self serving fundraising arm than usual.,Limberine,2025-04-24T15:14:20,113

"for all the people still in denial ignoring it bc “don’t worry he can’t do that”, sure. Legally he cannot. But this guy, and his large group of loyalists who have very powerful positions now, ARE actively working to try and do it. It doesn’t matter if you say he can’t. Say it with your chest and say, HE CAN’T because we won’t let him. Not he can’t because of laws he doesn’t care about. If you still think he actually cares about following the constitution, wake up.  This SHOULD alarm you. It’s a message saying he is ready to further undermine our government to use force to stay. It DOESNT MATTER if it once seemed unrealistic. Of course, any president with good intentions would NEVER. But we are dealing with a NARCISSIST, not a patriot.   Yes, a US president can only have 2 terms. That is as clear as it gets.   But, remember, and this is SO important- 47 does NOT want to be a president. That is not his ultimate goal. When he says he hates democrats, he MEANS DEMOCRACY AS A WHOLE.   Have hope. But don’t confuse it with ignorance or dismissal. Having hope does not mean downplaying the situation or ignoring the alarm bells for a domino effect into fascism.  Saying he can’t do something with the intention of doubting it is harmful, bc then nobody stops it before it happens.  You have to say he CAN’T do it, with the intention of pushing our representatives, senators, and even common people to speak out and oppose this before we lose not only our country, but more of our people. And don’t forget. People are already dying from this regime.   Get tf out of denial and stop downplaying. His intentions are clear. You think when other fascists had their rise to total power that people weren’t also in denial about their ability???? As long as you stay ignorant and treat it like it’s just a delulu dream of his, the easier it is for him to do it. He may be an idiot, but he’s a got a calculated group of hateful and unempathetic people who would love to feed his ego by helping him become a nasty dictator.  Don’t let him. Stop pretending it’s impossible. He will cheat as well and do unlawful and dishonest things to make it a reality so long as people don’t hold him accountable. Yes he’s a yapping narcissistic creepo grandpa, but he’s a yapping dumb grandpa with a thirst for power since money is getting boringgg. He loves to see other people hurting. He wants to play the sims with your life because that’s what gets these monsters off. He has zero empathy, and enough power and connections to ignore the law…. If people keep pretending nothing bad is possible.   GRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAHHHHH",hopefulocto,2025-04-24T15:37:05,26

"I found the purpose of chat gpt. The only reason for it to exist.   Attempting to run for a third term as president could be seen as betraying a consciousness of guilt depending on the context — especially if the individual is trying to avoid legal accountability or consequences that might follow after leaving office.  Here’s how the argument might go: 	1.	Immunity While in Office: Presidents often enjoy certain legal protections or immunities while in office. If someone aggressively tries to retain power beyond the constitutionally allowed terms, it might signal they’re trying to extend those protections. 	2.	Fear of Prosecution: If there are credible investigations or looming legal issues awaiting a former president, trying to stay in office could be interpreted as a way to avoid prosecution — suggesting they know they’ve done something wrong. 	3.	Deviation from Democratic Norms: Willingly violating constitutional term limits can be read as an act of desperation or fear — not just ambition. That fear might be tied to the consequences of stepping down. 	4.	Public Perception: Even if no charges have been filed, the act of clinging to power in violation of law might lead observers to conclude the leader believes they have something to hide — a sort of “if you’re innocent, why not step down?” reasoning.  Of course, this is largely a matter of inference — it’s not definitive proof of guilt, but a circumstantial sign that might support a larger narrative of wrongdoing.

SCOTUS will uphold their precedent - states can't remove someone from the ballot. He'll go to the election. From there, if he wins, it'll be up to Congress to say, no, sorry, you're ineligible.

"States do not have the power to disqualify a candidate for federal office. Blue states will be forced to put him on the ballot.

In an unsigned ruling with no dissents, the court reversed the Colorado Supreme Court, which had determined that Trump could not serve again as president under Section 3 of the Constitution's 14th Amendment.  The provision prohibits those who previously held government positions but later “engaged in insurrection” from running for various offices.  The court said the Colorado Supreme Court had wrongly assumed that states can determine whether a presidential candidate or other candidate for federal office is ineligible.",OisinDebard,2025-04-24T21:22:51,0
"And just like his first term, actually. Trump’s whole political career is basically just starting a meme and then snowballing it into reality. The only reason he gained initial traction in the first place was that the idea of his actually being president was so ludicrous.

">You need to drink some wake up juice because laws and precedent -  regardless if they are enshrined in the constitution - mean zero to the current cabal of GOP lawmakers and far too many GOP judicial appointees.  Let me put it another way: if laws and precedent mean nothing to them, what legal authority do they think they are exerting? Answer is its only the legal authority people believe they have, and other legal entities permit them to have, which is kinda the same thing. And if they're banking on nothing but popular acquiescence, they have to know that can turn on a dime, especially in the absence of firm legal footing, and if that happens, well... its happened before. They aren't exactly pioneers here.   I sincerely don't think they've thought through what might happen if people and states just.. stop respecting illegally assumed authority.  >This is some delusional Pollyanna'ing.

">What do you think the Constitution means? Do you realize the entirety of all legal authority stems from the Constitution? Do you think one corrupt misinterpretation of the law means that the law does not apply?  Couldn't help but notice you ignored my actual question. You're claiming he can't run because he's ineligible thanks to the 22nd amendment. I'm saying he was ineligible to run thanks to the 14th amendment. He did so anyway. You're saying he can't win because he's ineligible to serve the office thanks to the 22nd amendment. I'm saying he wasn't eligible to serve the office thanks to the 14th amendment. He is president anyway.   I'm asking you again, why do you think the 22nd amendment has the power to prevent him from running, when the 14th amendment did not? Are you implying that the ""Corrupt misinterpretation that allowed him to ignore the 14th amendment won't happen with the 22nd? Because to answer that question, yes, I DO THINK that ""one corrupt misinterpretation"" of the law meant the law doesn't apply, when the same people are interpreting the law you're citing.   >Do you understand the concept of criminality?

">Why do you think the 22nd amendment has any meaning when the 14th didn't?   This the question?   The answer is the 14th says the individual cannot serve as an officer, and the 22nd says ""cannot be elected"". Those are very different ideas. ""Cannot be elected"" does not mean ""can be elected"".   >You're correct on these counts, but you're missing the subtext. A dog COULD be elected,   No. A dog could not be elected to the Presidency. It could not take an oath of office. It is not a thing that is possible to do. That you're floating this hypothetical is a real fucking problem with your understanding.  >..if Congress didn't stop it.   Congress doesn't need to do anything.   >A 5 year old child COULD be elected,  No, they could not.   > if Congress didn't stop it.  Congress does not need to do anything.  >Trump COULD be elected a third time,   No he could not.  >...if Congress doesn't stop it.   Congress doesn't need to do anything.  >An Insurrectionist CAN be elected, if Congress didn't stop it, which they didn't.  There are legal issues that were not explored. There's a case to be made that Trump is serving in a capacity that he is not eligible for, and that makes official actions legally questionable.  >Again, how would this Forfeit anything?  ""Cannot be elected"" doesn't mean ""can be elected"".  >He already won one election that he was inelgible for. What power do you think would stop him from doing it again?   I'm going to let you percolate on that one.  >Except for the one that he used last time - by putting his name on the ballot and running.   And it would be accepted as a forfeit of the election. I'm not sure what you're missing here.  >This one, we agree on, probably. I mean, it IS the basis for the Civil War movie. I predict it will start off as a legal conflict, sure. He'll run, Some state will try to remove him from their ballot. the GOP will sue, like they did last time. It'll go to SCOTUS. SCOTUS will uphold their precedent - states can't remove someone from the ballot.  I don't think it'll get that far. The 14th and the 22nd amendment are not the same.   > He'll go to the election.  He won't.  > From there, if he wins, it'll be up to Congress to say, no, sorry, you're ineligible.  Congress doesn't need to do anything.  > If the GOP is in power, well, I don't see that happening. Either way, there's your war.  Kevin Roberts: ""The revolution will be bloodless if the left allows it to be."" Not the words of a patriot.  This is certainly might be the GOP power play, but it isn't one that ends the way they think it does.   >Congress wouldn't have to pass a law to permit it,  Nope. Certainly not necessary. We would need a Constitutional Amendment to permit him to be *elected* a third time. This isn't a matter of candidate eligibility, its a matter of ""cannot be elected"".  Cannot be elected does not mean can be elected.  >Now tell me why you think that matters to this administration.  I don't care if they think it matters or not.

"I wrote a lengthy post replying to all your points, but Reddit decided I couldn't post it. I don't know why, but instead, I'll just focus on one point that you keep bringing up:   >Cannot be elected does not mean can be elected.  You're absolutely right. Just like Cannot serve does not mean can serve, yet here we are. If he's elected, and the ""legal issues"" surrounding that aren't ""explored"", he will serve as president for a third term, just like he's currently serving a second term because the SAME people that would ""explore"" the ""legal issues"" of ""cannot be elected"" are the ones that didn't ""explore"" the ""legal issues"" of ""Cannot serve"". Believing that ""cannot be elected"" will keep him from pursuing, and if possible serving a third term when ""cannot serve"" didn't is the height of naivety. But to be honest, I don't think he'll attempt to be elected at all, so you'll be right - he won't be *elected*. Of course, that says nothing about serving a third term, as you pointed out many times.      The OP you replied to, and I, both agree with you - Legally, he can't be elected, OR SERVE, a third term. But that only matters if people stop it. You're implying it's somehow impossible for him to be elected, as if a magical barrier will appear that will stop him from getting 270 votes in the Electoral College. No. OP and I both are saying they will try to circumvent the constitution any way they can. Sticking your head in the sand and pretending he can't be elected is what has gotten us to this point in the first place.",OisinDebard,2025-04-24T22:59:15,2
