"Mike Johnson says democrats will try another ""baseless impeachment.""   Are you fucking kidding me? He literally said he doesnt know if he can abide by his oath or the constitution. In any normal democracy that would be impeachable asap",Training-Republic301,2025-05-04T19:18:55,175
Before anyone gets excited impeaching Trump means Vance is president,BreakfastFluid9419,2025-05-04T19:14:29,40
What agenda? There is no agenda in Congress. EOs are how Trump governs,vakr001,2025-05-04T20:05:45,11
Why would Kemp want to risk his political future by running for senate in a midterm year in a state where Trump is unpopular.,D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-04T21:13:43,5

"I don’t think it’s a smart move for Democrats to even bring up impeachment. Instead they should be going on any media platform and relaying a specific message that Trump is an unconstitutional president floating in corruption and criminality and Republicans are allowing it on their watch. Look, nothing is going to happen until the numbers are there. Give Trump and the GQP the rope to hang themselves, and lambast the Republicans for allowing it to happen. They were two exit ramps for the GQP to untie itself from MAGA and Trump, and they chose power and greed instead. They own this and the destruction his administration is doing. If Americans want change, they need to vote accordingly. They need to message on the despair happening from the broken promises of prosperity. A large faction of Americans are greedy as fuck. Dems lost because of eggs and Hunter standing on a board. Highlight Eric and Don Jr corruption every waking moment and how we are getting less with our hard earned dollar.",Finding_My_Village_2,2025-05-05T12:51:49,1
Oh he will be gone soon enough. GOP hopefully will be finished. Just like midterms on 1st terms.,Delicious_Leopard143,2025-05-04T21:04:05,19
"If I got paid a dollar every time he commits blatantly impeachable offense, I'd be richer than him. Now, imagine how frustrated some Democrats in Congress must feel about it. It's physically impossible to impeach him for everything he does.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T00:45:49,8

It’s preferable. Vance doesn’t have any juice for anything. He’d be a sitting duck.,EWAINS25,2025-05-04T19:20:55,54
"Counter point: Vance has the charisma of a rotten potato. Plus, if Trump is impeached, then it obviously means that the Democrats have the power to do the same thing to him if he steps too far out of line like Trump is currently doing.  Also, it's much easier to get the MAGA base energized to defend Trump because he is MAGA to them. Vance as previously stated, is like a rotten potato.   Like, as a topical example for May the 4th, imagine Darth Vader rallying fans of his to fight the Rebel Alliance. They'd be hyped as fuck. Now imagine Vader trying to rally his fans to fight the rebels on behalf of Grand Moff Tarkin. Sure the absolute hard core fanatics will keep going, but your more than likely going to lose a considerable amount of steam in the transition from Vader to Tarkin. Because while Vader is cool and badass, Tarkin is just a politician. One who happens to be in charge of the Death Star, but he's no Vader, not by a longshot.   So while Vance may be the VP, he is no Trump. He just does not have the charisma to get MAGA energized, and if the Democrats can impeach and remove ""the untouchable"" Trump, they can certainly impeach and remove Vance if he steps out of line again. Also, Democrats having the numbers to impeach and remove Trump, also means that they would take the House or Senate (preferably both), and thus a Democrat would become the new Vice President based on the presidential line of succession, which would be even more of a reason for Vance to stay in his lane, as otherwise if he himself was impeached, he'd be handing the Presidency back to the Democrats who would promptly clean house of Trump's cabinet and hopefully start going after them and the GOP like they should have done in 2021.",Railroader17,2025-05-04T19:53:09,22
yeah if its done before the midterms then vance can at most get one more term vs 2 if its done after,TheThebanProphet,2025-05-04T19:16:42,7

But if democrats can take either chambers he would just be a lame duck anyway. Seeing Trump get impeached probably might keep JD in line,Training-Republic301,2025-05-04T19:19:58,12
"No, that's what means if he's convicted and removed by Congress. Good luck finding 20 Republicans to do the right thing.  And he can barely be any worse. Trump is doing his best to turn America into nazi Germany. I don't think Vance can do any better.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T00:47:58,1
Much preferable. Vance will act out his agenda without any concealment. Trump voters will hate it. ,icanswimforever,2025-05-05T02:14:33,1

He's actually the only republican who's currently leading Ossoff in every poll right now. But Ossoff is narrowing the lead and he's likely gonna lead eventually as Republicans become more and more hated.,Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T00:53:38,5

"Oh, who fucking cares how frustrated they feel? They don't represent the people anymore than the GOP does. They keep voting for his nominees and kowtowing to their oligarch overlords.

"He's the preferred candidate of the billionaire oligarch fascists like Thiel though. Trump is a vehicle, a means to an end. But Vance is their golden boy",TyrannasaurusGitRekt,2025-05-05T00:24:29,8

"Should Vance become President due to Trump’s death or removal/resignation, Vance would select his VP per the Constitution.  It is not true that the Speaker would take that position (unless Vance chose him).",Objective_Ebb6898,2025-05-04T23:34:41,1
"Exactly. The problem that Kemp faces is that he might end up as Hogan. Be a popular governor, but lose because the voters don’t want him to be a rubber stamp for the MAGA agenda. Losing this would completely destroy his chances for president in 2028 or even VP if he can’t even win his own state. Another reason for his popularity is how he disagrees with Trump on certain topics, but as senator, he is expected to support all of MAGA’s agenda.",D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-05T00:58:13,3

"I mean, he was pretty good during the debate with Walz. Walz was a nervous mess and Vance managed to resemble human being for 2 minutes. He terrified me by his confidence and collectedness which made the grotesque garbage he said sound reasonable or acceptable.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T00:50:47,2
"I hope that Greene wins the primary if she throws her hat in it. She polls really well without Kemp in the primary poll. And losses to Ossoff so badly, he probably won't have to even campaign.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T01:00:34,1
"Oh, I definitely wasn't attacking you for your comment. I'm just pointing out that there are currently close to zero Dems even trying to do what you're suggesting. The lack of leadership is infuriating. They are horrible at being a resistance party.",YakiVegas,2025-05-05T02:55:44,3
"Yeah but it’s clear that Peter Thiel knew Trump would get impeached. So he brought in a moderate. Just imagine Mike Pence’s views, the guy who had a very controversial take on gay conversion therapy. Vance didn’t have extreme views until around 2019 when he started following Trump. I know JD Vance is not the hero here, and it’s clear that Pence has more of an adherence to the Constitution, but Vance is the guy Silicon Valley wants because he’s spineless and will go out of his way to be a hardcore moderate. This was shown to be the case with the leaked dossier",JollyToby0220,2025-05-05T02:04:44,1
"That would be hilarious. The goal would be for her to lose so badly in the first round, there would not even be a second round. Another thing to think about is if Trump would label Kemp as a RINO? Trump clearly wants the GOP to go more in line with his own policies and agenda, and Kemp seems to follow some of it. And Trump has a grudge against him for not helping rig the vote in Georgia in 2020.",D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-05T01:06:31,2
"That's true. That's why I said *SOME* Democrats. Most are sitting on their hands, but a handful is doing their jobs. And those that do, I assume that Trump is psychologically draining them",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-05T03:04:03,1
Oh no— not the spineless moderate!,FashionableLabcoat,2025-05-05T05:37:47,1
"That part definitely sucks but Vance seems like he won’t be imitating Trump if president. That’s not a good thing because Trump will cause a soft recession and Vance will stabilize it, by putting the cost on us.   And of course, the Leftwing will be angry, but not so angry that they will forget about politics. That’s what happened to Occupy Wall Street ",JollyToby0220,2025-05-05T06:33:41,1
