"As a resident of South Louisiana who worked extensively in the recovery from the storm, we received somewhere around 20 billion dollars in FEMA grants. Although I personally witnessed mass fraud (which when reported by me ended up in Federal court ), we would not be here ,without the Federal Government's help.",rondpompon,2025-05-09T01:54:36,23
"I agree with Hamilton in that getting rid of FEMA entirely is a bad move. I also agree with Trump in that FEMA’s gotta go. After what happened with FEMA refusing to give aid to Trump’s supporters during the Biden administration, FEMA should be taken off the federal level and given to the states instead, or be greatly restructured. That whole scandal can’t be allowed to happen again.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-08T15:12:48,12
It should be restructured as a fund specifically for states to access. Doesn’t need to be an agency.   States control warehouses where FEMA-funded resources are stored. States control the funds allotted to them. No more formal agency to run anything. That should end.,ITrCool,2025-05-08T15:42:06,59
