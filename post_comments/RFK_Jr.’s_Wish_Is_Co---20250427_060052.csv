" RFK Jr.’s Wish Is Coming True: Everybody’s Getting Measles  The number of measles cases in the U.S. has risen to 884 across 29 states. Catherine Bouris  Updated Apr. 27 2025 3:47AM EDT   Published Apr. 26 2025 7:29PM EDT   RFK Jr.’s vision for America is rapidly becoming reality, with the number of measles cases skyrocketing across the country, bringing the number of confirmed cases to a total of 884.  According to data published by the CDC on Friday, there have been 884 cases of measles reported across 29 states, including Alaska, California, Hawaii, Illinois, New York and Texas.  Just last month, the Health and Human Services Secretary appeared to argue in an interview with Sean Hannity that natural immunity was the best defense against the highly infectious disease. In other words, Kennedy believes that it would be great if everyone got measles.  “It used to be, when I [was] a kid, that everybody got measles,” he told the Fox News host. “And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection.”  He continued, “The vaccine doesn’t do that. The vaccine is effective for some people for life, but for many people it wanes.” He went on to argue against the MMR vaccine, telling Hannity that the government shouldn’t force people to get the vaccine, because, “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself cause, like encephalitis and blindness, etc., so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.”  Research shows that for more than 99 percent of the population, getting the MMR vaccine is much safer than getting measles, mumps, or rubella.  In 2025 alone, measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.  Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks with President Donald J Trump during a cabinet meeting at the White House on Monday, March 24, 2025 in Washington, DC. At least six of those states—Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio and Texas—have reported outbreaks, meaning three or more related cases. Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak, has reported 646 cases since late January.  There have been three confirmed deaths, two of whom were children: 8-year-old Daisy Hildebrand and 6-year-old Kayley Fehr. These are the first deaths from measles in the U.S. in more than a decade. The majority of cases have occurred in individuals under the age of 20.   Stanford University researchers have predicted that if vaccination rates remain steady, measles could become entrenched, resulting in hundreds of thousands of cases “where deaths are commonplace and hospitalizations are happening all the time,” according to Nathan Lo, a Stanford University physician and author of the study.  Only 2 percent of the 884 people infected in 2025 have received the recommended dose of the MMR vaccine.",ElderPimpx,2025-04-27T08:28:21,1

"While I don't agree with what RFK is doing, I really wouldn't worry about measles evolving in such a way where it could evade vaccines.  Measles binds to and infects cells via hemagglutanin surface glycoproteins. You can think of this protein as the virus's ""key"" to enter cells. It turns out that this protein is very stable, and any mutations that occur in these glycoproteins result in a virus that cannot properly function/invade host cells. (If you are interested you can read more about this [here](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(21)00041-0)). This is also the same protein that you develop immunity to when you are vaccinated (or infected).  That's why you don't need to get an annual MMR shot. Once you are vaccinated for measles, you ideally will be covered for life. Contrast that with the flu or COVID, where you are expected to get booster shots every year to keep you covered due to the high mutation rates of influenza hemagglutanin (the ""H"" in H1N1, for example) and the COVID-19 spike protein, respectively.  All that being said, lower vaccination rates are super concerning and will lead to many avoidable deaths.",skibud123,2025-04-27T15:23:05,1

If you're an older person, get your titers done, people!  *""A titer test is a blood test that measures the level of antibodies in the blood. It's used to determine if you've been exposed to a specific disease or infection and if your immune system has developed protection against it. The test can also be used to determine if you need a booster vaccination or if a previous vaccination has been effective.""*",Ghost_of_a_Black_Cat,2025-04-27T10:40:14,15

"Waning immunity is also theoretical. It’s being measured by titers, or antibody presence in the blood. The absence of titers doesn’t mean you have no immunity. It means you have less free flowing antibodies. Your immune system has a memory and macrophages and memory cells are all still ready to go and know the virus and would react rapidly.    Titers is just the only measurement we have.

Whilst also pushing the anti illegals, trans and DEI angle to spark violence.  Pestilence - RFK - Single handedly taking American healthcare back decades with his anti-vaccine rhetoric.  Famine - Elon Musk - Gutting government departments, cutting off social security, causing people to be unable to feed themselves. Whilst funnelling more and more money to himself.  Death - Steve Witkoff - In charge of talks with Ukraine, Russia, Iran, Gaza and Israel. Purposefully choosing the most fucked up ways to either prolong conflicts, or appease those who cause the most death and suffering.  War and Death could be interchangeable at this point though. Witkoff keeping wars going. While Hegseth is approving strikes on Houthis.

"That's it really.  I recall someone on Facebook posting a speaker talking about vaccines.  His points had merit, if you did no further critical thought or research.  The vaccine study was old (1970s), small (~50 people), had a small period of study (about a day of observation at the hospital), and reported a significant number of side effects (I think 10%).  Problems with this approach in order.....  It was from the 1970s, there's been more recent studies of the vaccine.  It was a small study. But of course, every person to have received this vaccine since could be considered another data point in the study (so millions of people effectively).  Yes the initial observation period wasn't long, but of course people who call in and report a side effect within the next few days would have been counted.   And as for side effects, we're talking classic vaccine side effects such as a mild fever or headache. Basically what all of us were told to effect from the covid vaccine.  And of course, this entire argument assumes that in the 1970s a bunch of scientists threw stuff tougher and injected 50 people then went ""no one died, good enough"".

"I don't think immune amnesia would lead to less effective medications for other illnesses. My interpretation of OP's comment was that lack of vaccination would make it so that viruses would spread more, ultimately giving a pathogen more of a chance to evolve and become immune to current therapies. While this is hypothetically possible I don't think that it's very likely. The pathogens that currently have long-lasting vaccinations like measles/mumps/rubella or VZV are either pretty evolutionary stable (as mentioned above) or have antigens that all cross-react with the same antibody (this is the case for mumps, where you are vaccinated against one strain of the virus but the resultant antibody protects you against numerous other strains). Also, lack of vaccination does not provide any sort of selective pressure on viruses/bacteria to mutate in such a way to become immune to antibiotics, vaccines, or other treatments, which is how antibiotic resistance occurs in bacteria (the surviving bacteria after an incomplete course of antibiotics reproduce with mutations that allow them to resist previously efficacious treatments).",skibud123,2025-04-28T13:38:16,1

"How many people were lobotomized in the United States?  About 50,000 people received lobotomies in the United States, most of them between 1949 and 1952. About 10,000 of these procedures were transorbital lobotomies. The rest were mostly prefrontal lobotomies. Walter Freeman performed about 3,500 lobotomies during his career, of which 2,500 were his ice-pick procedure.  Did Freeman operate on Rosemary Kennedy, the oldest sister of President Kennedy?  Yes, he did in the summer of 1941. This operation was one of his most famous failures. Freeman and his neurosurgeon partner James Watts performed a prefrontal lobotomy on Rosemary Kennedy, leaving her inert and unable to speak more than a few words. After her lobotomy she was sent to live at St. Coletta's School in Wisconsin, where she remained until her death this year at the age of 86.   https://www.npr.org/2005/11/16/5014565/frequently-asked-questions-about-lobotomies#:~:text=the%20United%20States%3F-,About%2050%2C000%20people%20received%20lobotomies%20in%20the%20United%20States%2C%20most,were%20his%20ice%2Dpick%20procedure.
