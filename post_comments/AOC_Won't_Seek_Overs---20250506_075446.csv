When you want change but the whole group’s still stuck in 1995.,LittleLasso,2025-05-06T08:05:19,1231
"This is a perfect microcosm of why the Democratic party struggles to get and maintain power. There are some really energetic young minds in the party and they constantly get pushed down by the old guard types like Pelosi and Schumer. Anytime they see progress, they stumble. As someone will no longer even consider voting for any republican considering the influence of the cult and the complete loss of any thing that resembles decency, this news angers me. Bright young talented popular woman can't get any runway to build herself from the base. And then they wonder why no one can get a broad consensus behind them. Even being really popular doesn't help bring out compelling ideas as we saw with Bernie in 2016. The old guard think they know what is best and don't care what anyone else thinks.",TheDarkHelmet1985,2025-05-06T08:31:58,771

Worth noting those underlying dynamics have almost nothing to do with Democrats.  The GOP has a majority in that (and every) committee which means they have enough votes to set the rules of the committee and there's no way the Republicans on the oversight committee will work with AOC and it requires the GOP working with the Democratic co-chair in order for Dems to have access to *any* information because it all flows through the GOP chair.,atreeismissing,2025-05-06T13:27:29,1

"Honestly, Dems are stuck in 1980. They had one transformative politician post watergate in Jimmy Carter who could’ve reshaped America in profound ways, but they’ve never had the will to triumph no matter the cost.   The Reagan Republican political machine was far too calculated, and still is today. And Dems know it. The only reason they’ve won since Carter is by glamming up liberal republicans in hopes of bringing enough non-indoctrinated conservatives over to barely eke out a win.  Until the Dems show some actual toughness like AOC, Bernie and JB, the Dems will just continue to flounder and make no lasting change.   Also, repugnicans have CPAC, Turning Point USA, ACU Foundation conference, and like a boatload more annual political action events.

Because the moderate prefers the negative peace of the status quo over the potive peace of having to change how society functions and how they personally have to change with progress.    Fucking moderates are literally more okay with genociding trans people than to recognize new pronouns and address people by the name they want to go by, even though any cis male could easily spend his entire life with a nickname unconnected with his given name.",Ok-disaster2022,2025-05-06T11:24:16,159

They do not want corporate dollars out of politics. They don't want an end to our involvement in Gaza. All of these things, who do they benefit? Which SES group? Our responsibility, IMO, is to educate other voters, shut down the decades old chatter that we can't disrupt the two-party system of choices, that we HAVE to accept crumbs. We have to remind voters they should choose the best people/ policies instead of the party prescribing who they want, and shaming anyone who thinks differently. It will require discomfort. It calls for new angles in political discussions. Prepare to answer to the tactic of the party accusing us of ""helping the GOP"" by not voting ""to stop"" Trump. Change won't ever come from the top. Push back against the media narratives the DNC coordinates, the insults, the misrepresentations. Speak up when the likes of Carvell insult us, call Progressives ""twerps"" and saying ""We'll be better off if Bernie just went away."" Who is the ""we"" he's speaking on? You? Me? Do not let your enthusiasm for change be eroded by other naysayers who leave us having to shit fit a candidate of their choosing.The closer we get to an election cycle, the more vocal we have to be. Not all Democrats get their news from across the sources like we do here on reddit. Many only have MSNBC and that source has a habit of serving as the establishment mouthpiece.

The RNC and DNC are corporations who are dedicated to maintaining registration across all 50 states in addition to their political activities.  People are suggesting that folks like AOC (maybe other DSA members) actually go through with the full process, because it is a whole different ballgame to be fully registered.  >[While not a political party, the DSA has increasingly engaged in electoral politics by endorsing candidates who align with its values, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, DSA members elected to Congress in 2018.

"Progressive still need the party purse, and they're shit at local and state level (which honestly, so is the rest of the party, treating local and state level elections as if they don't exist like the Easter Bunny). That's the only real note that they should take, is to build some smaller bases outside of the cities by flipping local and state seats and flipping them hard. Dems treat elections like the GOP does the economy, ideology will trickle down. School boards, trustees, and mayorships are the long game the Dems can't seem to even acknowledge nevertheless begin to play, and the progressives are nowhere near that level of popularity to spread themselves that thin to even think of it.",Raus-Pazazu,2025-05-06T21:51:35,2

If the Green Party stuck to solidly blue states, and didn't run unless it was clear the republican candidate wasn't going to win, then they could have grown and wouldn't jeopardize a state.

Trickle down economics refers to tax cuts for the wealthy. Clinton's tax bill cut taxes for small businesses and raised taxes for big businesses. It also raised taxes on the top two brackets - the richest people.  Clinton balanced the budget by taxing the rich. That is not really a right wing policy.

"No, that’s not true. “Right to work” are anti-union and exist in blue states with blue legislatures and state houses. Bill Clinton was president when “third way” policies of market-based solutions to social safety net issues ceded economics to the right and allowed them to push the culture war bs that Dems get pummeled on regularly. The ACA was a Heritage Foundation alternative to government sponsored healthcare and while made some modest tweaks to our already shitty system by and large kept the abject failure of a market based system intact. Drone strikes on American citizens, expanded domestic spying on American citizens happened under Democratic rule. Dems vote again and again to increase military spending, more consolidation of power under the executive branch under Dems. Cuts to SNAP and food stamps occurred under Democratic administrations. Dems regularly reach across the aisle to protect congressional insider trading with Ms. “I’m a capitalist” Pelosi. These are all right wing. Voting for the Iraq War and the “war on terror”. Refusal to abolish the filibuster to pass progressive legislation when the procedure solely benefits minority obstruction, still trying to “reach across the aisle”, slow dragging Trump’s criminal trials by a democratic administration led to Trump with unlimited executive power.

"If that happens, Republicans will dominate elections.  America is just a conservative nation - especially the (old) people who vote reliably.   Dems have lost in very close elections, but they had to face the inflation caused by the pandemic which Americans dumbly blamed Biden for, and there is a worldwide massive astroturfing operation by russia and other hostile nations and institutions that is drastically pushing extremist candidates like trump.   It's an extremely difficult time to win elections for anyone on the left, so winning around half of them is very good performance.   I do think that Biden should never have run in 2024 though, just because of optics. He actually would have been a fine president because the job doesn't require fast reflexes like a ball player or something - it's essentially all about appointing the right people and then just signing bills and doing speeches and stuff. But looking that old and tired killed his chances at winning, which were already in bad shape due to the pandemic and all the propaganda about illegal immigrants and socialism and all sorts of stuff that just isn't true.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-06T16:40:54,1

">No, that’s not true. “Right to work” are anti-union and exist in blue states with blue legislatures and state houses  False. This is a commonly repeated thing that you probably heard someone else say and thought was true. Right to work laws exist in ZERO blue states which have blue legislatures and state houses. They are in some purple states like Wisconsin and VA where the legislatures routinely flip.  >Bill Clinton was president when “third way” policies of market-based solutions to social safety net issues ceded economics to the right  Yeah this was 30 years ago, and after Democrats responded to voter demand to move right. The party has moved much more to the left since then.   >The ACA was a Heritage Foundation alternative to government sponsored healthcare  The ACA was modeled on Massachusset's healthcare system, not the heritage foundation. The whole Heritage foundation thing was their idea of a compromise system anyway, not a thing the Heritage foundation said they liked and endorsed.  >Cuts to SNAP and food stamps occurred under Democratic administrations  Nowhere near as much as increases in their funding did.  >Voting for the Iraq War and the “war on terror”  The majority of democrats in the House and Senate voted AGAINST the Iraq war.
