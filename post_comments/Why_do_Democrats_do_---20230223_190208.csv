"In presidential elections democrat performance in Montana has been declining since the 2008 Obama - McCain election. Giving it a cursory glance I see two big factors that I think explain how democrats do in Montana.   1. You're on the right track with looking into demographics; Native Americans are major supporters of the Democratic Party in Montana. They form one of three Democrat strongholds. Without looking at the Dakotas, I'd say that the extra two democrat pockets in addition to Native populations explain the difference in performance. The extra two pockets of democratic voters are students at the University of Montana and at Montana Tech. 2. Since I think that the students at the two universities are the reason Montana democrats get a boost compared to their neighbors, I would expect to see a strong correlation between how a Democratic presidential candidate performs in Montana and how they perform among youth nationally. That correlation seems to hold; Obama did very well with youth voters in 2008 and less well in 2012. Clinton did alright with voting youth in 2016 but Bernie did better, and youth turnout for Clinton was depressed in the general election as a result. We can see that Bernie outperformed Clinton in Montana. And finally youth votes went up for Biden compared to Clinton, as did Democratic performance in Montana.   So basically, you've got a bunch of young people on your two major college campuses, so when the democrats get young people excited, they get more votes in Montana.",[deleted],2023-03-04T19:42:40,2
