"Somehow, when kids start dying, facts start to sound pretty good",Acrobatic-Stoat,2025-04-07T20:57:03,1
Sad it took the death of two kids to get us here. Let’s hope there won’t be many more needless deaths.,kolaida,2025-04-07T20:57:58,1
">""I'm sorry, but there is no defense for this poorly worded statement,"" wrote Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, a prominent anti-vaccine activist who once claimed during a legislative hearing in Ohio that the COVID vaccine could cause patients to become magnetized, allowing them to stick ""spoons and forks"" all over their bodies.  When people make completely bogus claims, it's not the media's responsibility to quote them.  There's a danger in giving recognition to quacks and nutjobs in that it causes some readers to believe that these are simple differences of opinion.  They're not.  One person stated a fact, while the other person is completely deluded.  I wish the press would stop quoting delusional people as if their opinions mattered.",KapahuluBiz,2025-04-07T21:09:44,1

We really need to shut demonstrably stupid people out of public discussion. ,Blablablaballs,2025-04-07T21:08:02,1
Kind of cant put that back in the bottle. The people who believe in this nonsense arent going to magically change their mind and get their kid vaccinated. One of their own kids could drop dead and they still wouldnt vaccinate their healthy future children. Kids are going to keep dying or get crippled and this limp noodle would be one of the biggest reasons why.,ithinkyouresus,2025-04-07T21:08:28,1

Of fucking course that doctor featured in the article has a complaint against her by the Texas Medical Board for prescribing her patients Ivermectin to treat Covid.,CJDistasio,2025-04-07T21:06:26,1
He is still actively looking for quack doctors to “find” data supporting his bullshit. He is also saying vitamin a “cures” measles and a bunch of children got sick from taking this advice but this is nice to hear,Upstairs_Owl_1669,2025-04-07T21:11:00,1
"Science sort of wins this one, until tomorrow anyway",xxxxx420xxxxx,2025-04-07T21:22:03,1
He'll walk it back next week and sell vitamin a again until more kids die. He loves to kill kids with measles. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-07T21:30:30,1
Well I'm glad he finally read the science.   Gives me a little hope.,tracyinge,2025-04-07T21:32:48,1
