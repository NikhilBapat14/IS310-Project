"Although I haven't done any research, I suspect that in the centuries of early capitalism it was much more common for companies to be based in their country's capital city.  Companies are larger and more powerful than the usual shops and merchants of the medieval period, which brings them into greater contact with the government (as a client, regulator or rival). When jockeying for power alongside the monarchy, the aristocracy and other capitalists, it would've made sense to simply set up your headquarters as near the palace or parliament as possible. When time is money, you can't afford to spend days getting from Lancaster to London by carriage every time you need royal approval for a new trading colony.  The concern with transportation to the capital is probably only outdone by the concern of transportation to where your buyers are. Ignoring the fact that it was the American capital for a brief moment in history, New York famously became a trade and financial hub because of its location relative to the Hudson River. Amsterdam likely prospered because of its river access. As transportation became easier and more ambitious in the 19th and 20th, commerce became less fixated around the capitals and more fixated around the ports and waterways (case in point: the Strait of Hormuz).",ArchdukeAlex8,2022-11-20T22:26:53,7
"In the US, and also Australia and Brazil iirc, the choice of capital was done to deliberately avoid endorsing one place as more important than the others.   In the case of Britain, there's no competition- the London metropolitan area produces about a third of the country's GDP. Paris is roughly comparable for France.   In contrast, New York puts out about 7 percent of US GDP.",[deleted],2022-11-20T23:10:19,12
"I live in London.  One downside of having the administrative stuff here is that it adds to the cost of doing the administration. London property prices are very high, and because of that so are wage expectations. All those government employees doing the administration will be wanting London level wages. The offices they work in will also need to be rented at London rental prices, unless the government already own them.  Another issue is that it can cause resentment from other parts of the country. London is huge: its population is similar to a small sized country, and around the same as Scotland and Wales combined. A similar number of people again live in the counties surrounding the city. That means it gets a lot of economic attention anyway, just from the number of people working there. Throw in all the political attention as well, and other parts of the country complain that too much of how the UK works revolves around London.  There have been some attempts in recent years to move some parts of the civil service and public sector away from London. The body which manages driving licences has moved to Swansea in Wales, for example, and the BBC has moved a lot of jobs to Manchester.  However, it's not easy. Being an economic and cultural hub, London has a lot of factors attracting people to live there. It sounds obvious, but far more people choose to live in London than any other city in the country. Persuading people to leave London to work elsewhere isn't always easy. The BBC had a large turnover of staff when they moved their offices to Manchester because a lot of their employees didn't want to go.",Anaptyso,2022-11-21T11:00:19,4
"Most state capitols arenâ€™t in their biggest city. Pa Capitol is in Harrisburg as opposed to Philly, Pittsburg, Allentown. NY is in albany",Airbornequalified,2022-11-21T06:24:40,1
"Even so, intentionally separating it from other large cities and urban areas, didn't prevent DC from growing into a key economic center anyways.  Of course, I'd bet the cause is a lot of government and defense spending locally.
