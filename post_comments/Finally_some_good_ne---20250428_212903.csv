"It's more accurate to say that the Liberal Party has won at least a plurality of seats in Parliament.   I've been watching [CBC coverage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SATBOqyYODU) all evening. Two things strike me.    1. The CBC lumps together won *and* leading seats.  2. The leads are sometimes under 50 votes with most of the votes yet to be counted in many of them.   The Liberals as I write this are still about 12 seats short of a majority. Without a majority, other parties can bring down the government and trigger new elections.   A lot of early votes haven't been counted and exact numbers of seats are still fluctuating. But whatever the final numbers, Donald Trump has unintentionally brought the Liberal Party back from a near death experience. It was down near 20% in the polls around Christmas but has apparently picked up 42.6% of the votes so far.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-28T22:50:58,5

"In a weird sadistic way, I feel like Trump almost *likes* that this happened.   Granted, there is no common cause between him and the Liberals (or liberals in general), but what he cares most about is relevancy. This shows that he has an effect on others. And he particularly likes it when his power *hurts* someone.

"The second domino has fallen (first being the Wisconsin and NC supreme court races).  Third will be the VA/NJ race in Nov, and fourth and final being the mid terms a year later.    If the latter two fall like the first two, this should be an incredible sign.  If enough momentum happens, we usher in a newsom/shaprio/insert white guy here because dear god stop running women it's not happening anytime soon as much as I would love it.... This then puts the above two oldest SCOTUS members (Thomas/Alito currently 76/75) around their 80s in 2029, meaning up until spring of 2032 the two oldest SCOTUS members in question will be clocking 83 and 82.  Could they still be on the court by then?  Sure.  But is it possible one drops off or biology takes it's course during the 2028-2032 run?  Yes.  Even more crazy, during 2032-2036 here are the ages of the current oldest SCOTUS members as of April 1 2036: Thomas - 87, Alito - 86, Roberts - 81, Sotomayor - 81,       Given that incumbents get re-elected way more times than not, then whoever is in position to nominate these 4 in April of 2036 is vital.  That person needs to be someone who won re-election in 2032.  In order to do that, they need to win initially in 2028.  To do that, we need backlash to help swing the mid terms in 2026 and carry that forward to 2028.  That backlash began with WI and NC and continues forward to 6 months from now when voters in VA and NJ head to the polls.    Yes I've thought way too long about this.

There are many possible lessons from this, that being said, though they are all harder to implement in the United States where the general public is *insanely* reactionary and propagandized. One possible lesson is that solving the housing crisis is not optional for liberals - even in *our* election, Carney didn’t win only because of his massive advantage on Trump, he also won because for most of the campaign he, shockingly, *led* on economic issues, despite widespread public rage at his predecessor for mismanaging the economy. (Being one of the world’s premier economic managers does have its benefits, after all.)

"The issue with the CPC running up the score in rural ridings in Alberta and Saskatchewan is that the LPC and NDP don't even run real candidates in many of those ridings (and the BQ doesn't run candidates outside of Quebec). You can think of it like the Democrats not even running candidates (or running joke candidates) in the South because they don't see a path to winning those districts, and then the Republicans winning with 60%+ margins in said districts and running up the popular vote. It's basically padding the stats and doesn't give you any real insight into a party's national popularity because they're winning virtually unopposed landslides in a limited geographical area.  My own preference would be for the LPC and NDP to run viable candidates in these ridings because not doing so feeds into misconceptions about the popular vote, but I also understand their position of focusing resources on ridings where they have a viable path to victory.  Generally speaking because there is some nuance about which party gets first pass at forming government, the party with the most seats - either an outright majority or a minority coalition - chooses the PM. We don't vote for the PM directly except in his riding; instead we vote for our local MP who typically belongs to a party (we occasionally have some independent MPs, but not enough to make any meaningful difference in the House of Commons).",Conscious-Tutor3861,2025-04-29T13:31:38,1

Don’t cross a Canadian.  We can be the worst enemy the United States can encounter if they cross our borderlines.  Trump just made himself into the greatest laughingstock in the world by sidelining his own allies.    US now has no allies.  The reputation of US is down the toilet and no amount of plunging or snaking can unclog what he did.  That means even the goods are seen as a bad product by others.

"You seem to really be pushing the narrative that the concervatives are good for the economy. Trump is a concervative and in power for the last 100 days or so. Is the American economy doing well?  You can save the environment and have a good economy. It's not mutually exclusive. The environment is generally where all the livestock, crops, and wood are kept. Can't exactly eat or build anything if we can't grow anything. Can't work if we can not breathe the air or get cancer from the carcinogens near the work site. Even if saving the environment may cost slightly more in the short term, it will save billions in the long term. Not to mention the increased quality of life and lives saved.  It's like buying the 130$ work boots instead of the 100$ ones. The 100$ boots will last twice as long for an extra 30%. If the cheap boost lasts 1 year and the price boots last 2 years, the pricey boots actually cost 65$ per year.

"The simple truth is that the way Canadian politics is designed limits special interests. Corporations and unions are forbidden from funding political parties, there are no super PACs, there is a strict limit on donations, and Elections Canada has strict monitoring and enforcement.   Obviously I want the USA to be a great country, you are the most powerful economy and military in the world. But, the billions of dollars that go into the American political system, lobbying by military, medical corporations and other special interests mean that the possibility of the USA to change is astronomically difficult. Obama spent his presidency to try and give people medical insurance and he couldn’t do it because that’s “socialism” or whatever.  While my province we have Crown Corporations which are government corporations that run the insurance company, healthcare, natural gas, electricity, transit, and almost all services and they work incredibly well and all profit goes back to the government to be spent. That’s socialism, it works, and it’s great. How would that ever work within USA. It is terrifying to imagine the system in the USA that you have to  deal with.
