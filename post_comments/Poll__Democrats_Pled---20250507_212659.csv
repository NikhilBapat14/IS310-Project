"Impeachment is a trap. We‚Äôll never get the Senate votes to convict. It‚Äôs just another opportunity for Dems to look like losers and Trump to look like a martyr. It‚Äôs happened twice now. I don‚Äôt care what the polls say. They‚Äôre either talking to the wrong people, or folks think they mean it when they say they want him gone, and then change their minds when it‚Äôs go time.  The average American - I‚Äôm talking about low-info voters here, not propaganda consumers of the right or the left who are going to have a given strong opinion - likes Trump personally. They think he‚Äôs funny and he gives them permission to think and say things they felt shamed for thinking and saying for a long time. That has created a very powerful bond. Many of these people feel like he gave them their pride or their agency back. And they may not like all of what he says or does. Some of it is too mean or too authoritarian for them, and they get frustrated with him. But when push comes to shove, that bond is going to stand strong. They‚Äôre never permanently disillusioned. They think of him as family. And Grandpa may embarrass you with some of the things he says, but you know he loves you and you love him, and it would be wrong not to invite him to Thanksgiving.  Never mind that he has some truly retrograde opinions about non-white people. Never mind that he has friends who steal from the rainy day jar. Never mind that he insists on driving even though he sometimes has a hard time remembering how to get home. Never mind that some of the cousins have unsavory stories about Grandpa sneaking into their bedrooms at night.  Family is family. And you don‚Äôt turn away family.  Now I‚Äôm not saying this is how it *should* be. I‚Äôm telling you how it *is*. He‚Äôs not going anywhere. And any effort in that direction is just going to make it harder for Democrats to beat him or Uncle JD or whoever the fuck runs next time. They‚Äôll point at us and laugh, like they always do. And the rest of the family will laugh with them.",RPMac1979,2025-05-08T06:14:08,7

"Copying a prior comment of mine on a similar article that says it all:  ""This is a trash angle. AVOID THIS MINDSET AT ALL COSTS.  I'm sorry but liberals just only know how to lose elections.  If you want to keep losing elections, waste your time on prosecuting your political opponents. Even if your opponents did break the law, most people see a distinction without a difference, since everyone kind of appreciates that politicians are messy and corrupt. Only the jury will really understand the specifics of why someone violated a law...and it takes DAYS or WEEKS sitting in a court room to convince them most times. The conservatives are doing the same thing - prosecuting/investigating their political enemies (whether or not this is justified). Notice: it's not winning them any votes, either.  Meanwhile independents whose votes the dems desperately need if they ever want to win back control literally just want to see politicians focusing their energies on the constituents' MATERIAL needs (economics, public services, human rights, quality of life). This is why so many people I know who voted for Trump in 2016 (and even some who voted for him in 2020 and 2024) told me at the time that they would have voted for Bernie if it was Trump vs Bernie on the ballot. It had NOTHING to do with policy specifics or philosophy...it's the perception that either candidate was going to do something for them. Hillary and the dems focused unnecessarily on trying to convince voters that their opponents (Trump/the republicans) were evil and dangerous. Trump did that as well Re: Hillary/Biden/the dems. But whether or not someone's political opponent is corrupt/breaking laws/destroying democracy, talking about a court process is THE OPPOSITE of talking about a UTOPIAN FUTURE and IMPROVEMENT ON OUR CURRENT QUALITY OF LIFE. It's a proposal for a depressing legal process, not a vision for a period of time anyone would want to live in. I point this out because Trump promised everyone the world in 2016, 2020, and 2024. And I think it's important to notice in 2016 and 2024 people were hungry for any chance at a change in their material conditions. Prosecuting your political opponents may seem like the ""right"" thing to do - either legally or through the lens of history, but it's not a winning formula for building a voting base and governing coalition. Most voters would really rather you just sold them on the idea that you are going to make their lives better. Trump didn't even know what a tariff was 3 months ago and might not even get what one is even today, but the people who voted for him weren't checking whether he knew what a tariff really was - they just believed he was going to try SOMETHING to make their economic standing improve. Ironic, right?  TLDR: telling someone you are going to make them spend the next several years suffering through some court battle or impeachment or investigation is not exactly most people's idea of a good time.""",recherche24,2025-05-07T23:34:14,3

Let's say we either get enough Republicans in the house and senate to pass articles of impeachment and he's convicted in tge Senate, right?  Trump is out.  Well looky who is the new president.  JD Vance.  I mean at the very least this is why he was chosen.  If Trump gets impeached Vance is just a figurehead..  Trump will still be calling the shots.  They'll still be implementing Project 2025 only Trump will be doing it from Maralago and not the white house.  We are damned if we do and damned if we don't.  Arguably it might be worse since Vance doesn't have as much baggage as Trump does.  He might be someone maga rallies around since they'll believe Trump is still running the show which will probably be true.  Are they going to remove Vance too?  Highly doubt it cause it will look politically motivated.  Also a Mike Johnson presidency is another nightmare scenario.  However I don't think Trump will be impeached before the midterms in which case a new Speaker will be chosen.  I don't think we're going to have another Nixon/Agnew situation.

All his yes-men would lock the doors from the inside and he'd have enough men in important places to declare martial law or have Congress arrested or who knows what else.   Unfortunately our whole system banks on people acting in good faith and that has been completely shattered. There is no secret Congress force who would barge in, cuff him, and drag him away.

"What a load of bullshit. Trying to do something to stop Trump will do infinitely more for the Democratic party than sitting on their asses. They should have had an article of impeachment presented for every single impeachable offense Trump committed, even if they knew every single one of them would fail.  What undermines a political party is doing nothing. What undermines the concept of impeachment is not trying to do it every time there is reason to do so. People aren't going to respect an institution or the law that only tries to arrest and convict a criminal one out of every 30 times someone commits the crime right out in the open. By not trying to impeach Trump every time he does something impeachment worthy, they are completely destroying the concept of impeachment. Succeed or fail, trying to impeach every single time will only strengthen impeachment.  By trying to impeach Trump, they are showing they are TRYING. Though they should be doing a lot more than just trying to impeach the guy, they should be attacking him from every direction, even though none of them have a snowball's chance. Trying and failing at every possible opportunity would be much much much much much much MUCH better for the Democratic party as well as their chances of success at actually getting something through.  Trump's supporters also knew he wasn't going to make the country better. That's what Trump claimed and what his supporters parroted to make the idea of supporting Trump look more palatable to other people. The real reason they support Trump is bigotry and any claim otherwise is a complete lie. That's why the reasons they claim to support him don't hold up under even the slightest scrutiny.  Trump's supporters, every single one of them, want to be able to step on whoever they hate without consequences and they believed Trump would allow them to do that, nothing else.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-08T03:41:28,1
