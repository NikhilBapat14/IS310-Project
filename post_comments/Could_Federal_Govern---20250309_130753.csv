"As a scientist - it’s already starting. I’ve seen multiple reports by scientists on social media that many of their colleagues are now contemplating leaving the US altogether, after never considering so years ago.   Foreign universities have recently started recruitment programs for top US scientists interested in leaving.   Perhaps the hardest hit already are current college graduates - the current application cycle for graduate programs is a shit show, and many top universities are freezing or rescinding admission amid the funding chaos. This affects the future of US industry too - where do you think phd level researchers in pharma and other advanced STEM jobs are coming from?

"There are two sides of the equation.  The US is becoming less attractive to people in STEM fields right now, aside from those in very specific subjects that are getting a boost from the current AI bubble. The uncertainty of the low-intensity trade war, high interest rates, and cuts to grant funding are affecting both public and private scientific R&D. There's also the unavoidable demographic fact that scientists, inherently well-educated and generally urban, are overall not going to be happy about the political direction America is taking.  That said, where do disgruntled scientists and engineers go? The size of the US economy means that its fickleness towards free-trade impacts all countries. While America is interrupting and cutting research funding, it is still far and away the biggest funder of research in the world (assuming the various freezes are resolved soon).  I think a lot of American scientists are dissatisfied with the state of science in America, but there isn't an attractive enough destination country to convince them to leave.",0points10yearsago,2025-03-10T09:20:55,7

It’s easy to just cancel and cut jobs and funding, and show “savings” without having to take into consideration of any of the downstream effects.

Ultimately, productivity -- something Trump has emphasized the importance of -- is clearly greater in the private sector, even if you dislike that it's profit-driven.

That is more that even voted for Trump. Voters on both sides want to reduce wasteful government spending and most approve of shrinking the government workforce as a means to do it.   Also, they don’t want the government to fail because that would mean the cuts failed.  They want to show the fact the government still functions properly after the cuts and then propagandize that to go further.

"I get your point, but it's a bit flawed. Europe, in particular, makes it fairly easy for US academics to relocate into their countries, particularly individuals from top US schools. They pay a standard living stipend for the area in which they move, that while is not a trendous amount, it is often just as much if not more (in relative terms) to what one would make in the US. Plus, job security and healthcare is much more secure.   Companies, yes. It is hard for individuals (particularly new grads), to secure a visa. However, again, depending on the school the US student attended, there are countries that will provide a 1 year, transferable work visa (ie: UK). That being said, experienced professionals and PhD level individuals will likely come across a few options if they look hard enough. And, relocation is often a standard when a European company hires a US employee (at least from the JDs I've seen).  Any move is a cost benefit analysis, but given the current administration's attacks on education, research, DEI (in all forms...look at the list of banned words the white house recently released), it very well could be worth the move for many, even if only for a few years to continue working in their fields. Likely, the researchers will have a difficult time finding a US company that is willing to hire at their level, especially given the uncertainty with the on-again/off-again tariffs, tankng stock market, and amongst soon to be influx in supply of highly skilled people. But there is definitely demand for highly skilled and educated STEM individuals in countries people would want to move to (europe: clean energy, technology companies looking to be less reliant on US, actually, any industry abroad looking to become less reliant on the US, a multitude of sectors in Asia; hell, I've even seen an uptick in banks recruiting US finance professionals in the middle east. While a small sample, I know a few bankers who already moved to the cities in the middle east, and many now are seriously considering it. Plus, having an international experience on one's CV will only make them a more appealing candidate should they decide to return if/when things get better.  So to summarize, I see your point. But, i don't think it's as cut and dry as you're making it out to be. Many people most impacted are not only out of a job, but out of an entire industry. That in itself, putting a highly skilled/educated workforce into positions that don't require those skills is a form of ""brain-drain,"" it's just within our own borders. But I'm certain we'll see higher numbers than usual of people leaving to go abroad, as well as lower applications from students abroad (although, im curious if the latter happened in history first term).

It's like if I have a plumbing leak and the first guy I hire starts out by setting my garage on fire.
