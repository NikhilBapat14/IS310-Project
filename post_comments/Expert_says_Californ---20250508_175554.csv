">However, Colin Murphy, the Associate Director of the Energy Futures Research Group at the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies refutes the likelihood of these predictions.   >""It’s incredibly unlikely we’d get up to the $8 a gallon level,"" Murphy said. He notes that the dire scenarios highlighted in the report are worst-case possibilities. Murphy adds that the California Energy Commission has been examining strategies to mitigate such risks.  >The closures could significantly impact the availability of gasoline, sparking concerns throughout the state. Yet, Murphy also cautions that the projections fail to consider proactive measures the state could take.",Easy-Preparation-667,2025-05-08T18:09:43,6
Which is funny because oil prices are down 25% since the beginning of the year due to economic worries.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-08T17:57:45,6
“Experts say comet has 2% chance of hitting earth”  Sounds like this guy did price forecasts assuming that everything that could go wrong would go wrong.,hikeonpast,2025-05-08T18:01:14,4

Stuff like this is what leads people to leaving California. It's just not affordable. It also makes Democrats look bad for working people. There's no reason this should be allowed to happen there.,Scarlettail,2025-05-08T18:07:20,-9
"Wait, so it’s a clickbait title? Would media actually do that to people? Just mislead them into anger reading their articles??",AmrokMC,2025-05-08T18:12:03,8
What does that have to do with California increasing taxes on gas?,censor-me-daddy,2025-05-09T10:31:56,2
I mean a 2% chance like that is pretty high and worth listening to the experts on. Maybe we should trust experts and not dismiss when they say things which might not align with our political views or teams.,Scarlettail,2025-05-08T18:04:37,0
California grew in population last year and we're the #4 economy in the entire world. lol,Evening-Vegetable442,2025-05-08T18:35:32,7
"It's clickbait. The article even has another expert counter the aforementioned expert. It's a worst-case possibility, not a guarantee. Stop falling for the Republican propaganda about California.",LordSiravant,2025-05-08T18:14:56,7
Yeah… disappointing how well it works,Easy-Preparation-667,2025-05-08T18:58:08,2
"Nobody has divided political views about expensive gas.  If you read the article, you know that the experts are saying this guy assumed the worst in his projections.    Consider $8/gal gas to be a worst case scenario in the future, and a click-bait headline today.",hikeonpast,2025-05-08T18:08:47,3
