"As usual, he's showing his ignorance about our military. This change of name would suggest that our military has no value whatsoever beyond winning battles. It shows that he's unaware that much of the combat that happens these days occur as sorties, rather than major, lengthy battles. It shows he doesn't know that our military have many important duties that don't necesarily involve combat. It suggests that veterans who have been on the losing end of things, some whom have lost limbs,  and who bear scars both physical and emotional, are not worthy of respect and gratitude.

"When Trump was a teenager he went to rich kid military school. Many of his classmates later served in the Vietnam war. Trump avoided military service with a host of fake medical exemptions. This is why Trump is always diminishing veterans. It justifyes his cowardly choice. Trump needs to believe that he avoided a scam and the veterans who served in foreign wars are ""suckers and losers"".   I hear conservatives use the same logic when it comes to higher education. Education is a scam that they smartly avoided not an obstacle that they couldn't overcome.",_wisky_tango_foxtrot,2025-05-03T16:39:46,3
