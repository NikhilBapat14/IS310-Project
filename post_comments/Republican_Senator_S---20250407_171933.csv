"We can only hope. I do want things to get worse before they get better. It would be very positive for the country if we can get multiple generations of people to remember this experience over the next few years and have them associate it directly with Trump, with social media misinformation, with blind political ideology, etc.  Too many older people who still remember real American hardship have died. As a country we have to all touch the stove for a while. Sadly that includes those of us who voted against this.",destinyeeeee,2025-04-07T17:37:57,10

"1.) This is Navarro's stupid idea.   He owns it.   (hat tip to Ron Vara, [the fake alter ego expert he invented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk) where he claims he gets his best ideas from. )  2.) Trump is stupider than Navarro and as leader he gets to own it, too.    3.) The Republicans are fully capable of stopping him but they aren't trying.  So they own it too.   4.) Giving a shit about who to blame for this for purposes of assigning political blame is far less important than stopping this brainless, idiotic action.

You better continue to hope that Elon rigs all the election systems or that every single MAGA person in the country turns up to vote themselves into living in hovels on the side of railroad tracks, because we are coming for those seats.

They have learned how to game the rule of law, and now they will actively try to dismantle the judicial branch. It‚Äôs in plain sight. Why are they not being arrested? I‚Äôm looking at you, Roger Stone, Stephen Miller, Elon Musk, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, pencil nose from Texas, MGT, RFK. All of them accuse the left of committing terrible crimes.
