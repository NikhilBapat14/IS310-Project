I will NOT allow them to blame Trump. That shitweasel Kennedy owns this just like trump. They have the power to stop it and they choose not to.,huenix,2025-04-07T17:42:13,260
Why wouldn’t he be responsible? He wouldn’t care anyway he’ll just be out playing golf and use Biden as his scapegoat— miraculously Biden on the Democratic Party are to blame 🙄,mlineras,2025-04-07T17:24:54,55

"We can only hope. I do want things to get worse before they get better. It would be very positive for the country if we can get multiple generations of people to remember this experience over the next few years and have them associate it directly with Trump, with social media misinformation, with blind political ideology, etc.  Too many older people who still remember real American hardship have died. As a country we have to all touch the stove for a while. Sadly that includes those of us who voted against this.",destinyeeeee,2025-04-07T17:37:57,10

Excerpts:  Speaker Mike Johnson said Monday that the House will provide President Donald Trump with “space” to carry out his massive global tariff regime, even as some GOP lawmakers openly plead with Trump to negotiate off-ramps before the levies kick in on Wednesday.  “We’re going to give him the space necessary to do it, and we’ll see how it all develops,” Johnson told reporters Monday afternoon.  “I think you’ve got to give the president the latitude, the runway to do what it is he was elected to do,” he replied when asked about the legislation.",lnc_5103,2025-04-07T18:05:54,9

"1.) This is Navarro's stupid idea.   He owns it.   (hat tip to Ron Vara, [the fake alter ego expert he invented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJbZCbBLqkk) where he claims he gets his best ideas from. )  2.) Trump is stupider than Navarro and as leader he gets to own it, too.    3.) The Republicans are fully capable of stopping him but they aren't trying.  So they own it too.   4.) Giving a shit about who to blame for this for purposes of assigning political blame is far less important than stopping this brainless, idiotic action.    But yeah, unless you're vocally and directly opposing this stupid policy, you own it too.   That includes you,  Kennedy, you cosmic-scale dumbass.",mjc4y,2025-04-07T19:56:00,6

"You are responsible for allowing it to happen. ALL of you stood with him, passed everything he put in front of you, and even passed a tax plan in the middle of the night so no one would know you did it.  But we do know. We know what you are doing and you were complacent in allowing it to happen.  There will be no saving any of you in the mid-terms. You better continue to hope that Elon rigs all the election systems or that every single MAGA person in the country turns up to vote themselves into living in hovels on the side of railroad tracks, because we are coming for those seats.  They have not invented a word for the number of people going to vote blue in the mid-terms.

"Simply because they have learned to lie and then deny till they die. When we come out of this darkness, I hope prisons are opened for these absolute traitorous felons. They have conned their followers at the expense of the rule of law and the constitution. Surely Trump and his followers have committed treason, documented treason. They have learned how to game the rule of law, and now they will actively try to dismantle the judicial branch. It’s in plain sight. Why are they not being arrested? I’m looking at you, Roger Stone, Stephen Miller, Elon Musk, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio, pencil nose from Texas, MGT, RFK. All of them accuse the left of committing terrible crimes. They never provide proof, yet there is so much documented proof that these “patriots” have injected cancer into our country and will no doubt profit while the hard-working Americans and Republican supporters will experience untold suffering.

"That’s a fools errand.  Here’s the thing:  Trump said there was a witch hunt and received sympathy for his misgivings.  Another impeachment will just empower him and create a bigger wedge, regardless of justification for impeachment.  I don’t like impeachment becoming a political football and buzzword.  It should be reserved for truly serious, grievous offenses and in term 1, the justification was there - twice.  Trying again would not work",Grand-Ad-5029,2025-04-07T20:25:50,1

"They already had a chance to correct it before it started. House Democrats took action that would have forced a vote within two weeks to remove or keep the president’s declaration of an emergency that gave him this unilateral tariff ability.  In typical cowardly fashion, the GOP literally made up a solution to avoid having any responsibility. The vote had to be completed within two weeks, so what did they do? They literally passed a resolution stopping time, they made the entire rest of the legislative year one day. I wish I was joking. It is one of the most insane things I’ve ever seen in politics in my life, and no one talks about it, except Rachel Maddow covered it.
