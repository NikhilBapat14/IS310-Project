One thing is proving is that Market is just going off of vibes. I read an article/report yesterday that Shipments are sailing off with only 40% or less filled whereas previously it was completely 100% filled.  People are not still realizing but this will hit like a train in the upcoming couple of months. We are about to be short on almost everything here in the country.,PixelationIX,2025-04-27T08:24:15,14

"> WE....ARE......FURIOUS that he is destroying our country, our safety, our security, and our lives.  77 million people voted for Trump. Don't be mad at Trump. Be made at the people that wanted this to happen to you, to your family, and to your friends.  In order for Trump and Republicans to get us here it took 77,000,00 people to show up and say, ""Republicans will make my life better."" And then vote for Trump and Republicans.  >“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.”  You want to be furious at Trump? Try letting 77,000,000 know you are furious. Let them know that they are not welcome.     Disabled people detained by Ice sound alarm over overcrowded jails   https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/ice-immigration-detention   > In his three months locked up at Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, Rodney Taylor has missed meals and showers, lived with increasing pain in his hips, developed a swollen thumb on his right hand and blisters on the stumps where his two legs were amputated when he was a toddler. >  > Taylor’s mother brought him to the US from Liberia on a medical visa as a small child. He went through 16 operations and is a double amputee. He has two fingers on his right hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community, and recently got engaged. >  > Nonetheless, his immigration status is unresolved, and despite having an application for residence – commonly known as a “green card” – pending, on 15 January Ice agents arrived at his Loganville, Georgia home and took him to Stewart. >  > The reason, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the Guardian: a burglary conviction he received as a teenager and which the state of Georgia pardoned him for in 2010.  >In addition, the prosthetic legs have batteries that require eight hours of charging a day. But after being locked up at Stewart, he didn’t even see a doctor for three days, and in the ensuing months, the facility has never been able to arrange for eight hours of charging, allowing only several hours at a time. The result: the batteries die and the legs don’t bend, creating more pain in Taylor’s hips.  >Taylor and Owings sought a medical leave, in order to see the doctor who could at least fit him for the new prosthetic legs – and were denied. A second petition is “under review”, he said.  >“It’s all happening in the dark,” said Sarah Owings, Taylor’s attorney, speaking of conditions facing her client and others like him.",tech57,2025-04-27T08:45:42,1
