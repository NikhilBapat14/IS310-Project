Someone is jealous that a certain former president was the editor in chief of the Havard Law Review.,thieh,2025-04-28T19:38:37,13
"=== MAGA DECODER ===  Belief in a ""natural order of the races"" is an intrinsic part of conservative ideology. So they believe that policies that promote equality are a form of injustice and evil.  This is why fash/MAGA are purging Black people from positions of power. And why they are aggressively erasing Black people from the story and history of the United States. For them, the story of the United States is solely a story of the superiority and heroic achievements of the white race. Whiteness IS America. So all victories against racism are attacks against America. And all achievements by Black Americans are attacks against the Story of America.  So this purge at Harvard will scrutinize every editorial decision that speaks against racism or includes Black authors. The fash/MAGA will demand the editors justify each instance. And, no surprise, they will judge no reason to be enough enough to justify the inclusion of Black authors, non-white-supremacist viewpoints, or even just historical facts that don't fit the fash narrative.   We all understand that this is fascism. Not even fascism lite. And they are just getting started. Let's not sanewash it or pretend they mean what they say.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-28T20:07:55,9
"Why donâ€™t they try to solve issues instead of picking fights with everyone. The chickens are on their way home to roost.  Lots of bankruptcies, lay-offs galore, plunging 401 Ks, soaring interest rates and prices, and very empty store shelves.  Trump is already in the polling toilet and this is merely the calm before the category 20 hurricane of tariff hurt slams into America.  Image what Americans are going think of their senile, sociopathic, imbecile president when the shit really starts to hit the fanâ€¦",individualine,2025-04-28T19:43:47,3

It's clear that Harvard and all of the other elite universities engage in race-based discrimination. East Asian-Americans & South Asian-Americans are massively overrepresented among the top high school graduates. If admissions were race-neutral they would make up the bulk of the non-legacy portion of incoming students at the prestigious universities. Instead they are stuck competing against each other for spots under the limits kept in place informally.   But despite that obvious widespread bigotry affecting thousands of young people each year I knew this administration wasn't looking for discrimination that *helps* white people. Instead this is about fast-tracking consideration of an article written by a single (non-white) student.   Predictable. ðŸ˜’,yo2sense,2025-04-28T21:16:17,-4
