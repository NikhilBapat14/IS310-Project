>Less than two-thirds of white South Africans agreed that apartheid deprived black people of their livelihoods  Wild but not surprising. And of course it would be that third that would want to come here with that racist attitude.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-01T11:13:39,17
They will make the US even more toxic with regards to race relations just like they did in Australia when the country allowed them in 1994 after Apartheid ended.,Relevant_Goat_2189,2025-05-01T13:01:13,3

"Ever heard of the AWB? If not you should look them up, also while your at that look up the “1994 Bophuthatswana crisis”.",LogiePogie69,2025-05-01T12:40:14,3

"You don’t think that a nationalistic community who actively opposed the end of apartheid and is now creating communities like Orania that are segregated, is causing damage to the idea of a unified and equal South Africa?",LogiePogie69,2025-05-01T13:24:11,2
"Maybe, but I asked how, and you have yet to answer.  What are they doing to destroy South Africa?",Ernesto_Bella,2025-05-01T13:26:05,-3
"Idk what part of “creating segregated communities to damage South African unity” doesn’t answer your question of ”how”. That’s is how they are actively destroying South Africa, by creating separatist communities to fuel a return to a segregationist society. How about I ask you how the Afrikaner’s are helping South Africa?",LogiePogie69,2025-05-01T13:36:35,2
"There are like 1,000 people living in Orania.  How is that destroying South Africa?  If it is, then white people are more powerful than I thought.",Ernesto_Bella,2025-05-01T13:43:34,-2
"It’s the fastest growing community in South Africa, I agree with the idea of a boer free state as South Africa is the clusterfuck that it is the result of British colonialism, but in order to have a unified state you have to have a population that is actively trying to better the country not separate itself from the country. The fact that it is growing so fast shows the lack of pride in a unified South Africa and the continued support of a return to apartheid. It may be a small population but the boers have always been a small population that holds immense power in South Africa.",LogiePogie69,2025-05-01T13:51:08,1
"OK, but it would appear that they are not responsible at all for the ongoing cluster\*ck in South Africa, which is why they are trying to create their own community.",Ernesto_Bella,2025-05-01T13:53:21,0
"The ongoing clusterfuck is a result of the apartheid regime that controlled South Africa, that the Afrikaners were directly involved in as they were white, what they are doing now is creating another apartheid government, I’m all for them creating their own community and even nation state but continuing the mistakes of apartheid will just end up with the same issues that plague South Africa today. If the nation was unsegregated it would atleast have the chance of being better.",LogiePogie69,2025-05-01T13:59:16,2
