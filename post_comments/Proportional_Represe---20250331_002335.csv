Hungary and Israel have proportional representation. That did not stop authoritarians from taking power.   There should be gerrymander reform and ranked choice voting like Australia. But I like the idea of holding one representative responsible for the area where I live.,clamorous_owle,2025-03-31T04:51:30,2
"My main gripe with our current system is a state with 10 people in it has the same power in the senate as a state like california. Also, states like Texas are dominated by rural areas and those in the cities have little say. I wont pretend I know the best system to address these issues, but I do know our current system is not working for most people.",MaximusDM22,2025-04-02T14:15:22,1
