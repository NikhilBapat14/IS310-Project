"What the fuck is wrong with her? Seriously. Something enormous and deep inside this woman is broken. I used to work with people with personality disorders, going through long haul therapy to see if they can change, so I have heard some incredibly dark things from people.   This is one of the cruelest things I’ve ever heard someone express. It’s also incredibly telling that she is saying this publicly. Even the folks with anti-social personality disorder who had engaged in seriously deviant criminal behavior would not actually say this kind of shit out loud - at least not unless you’d worked with them weekly for years to get the trust. They have at least some sense of what things you just never admit to wanting or doing. Even sociopaths want to be respected (out of fear or otherwise) but people actually LOSE respect in response to this kind of repulsive desire. What she is saying she wants to do, on top of her past bragged about actions, mean she is profoundly damaged. Do not trust this woman alone with children or pets. She should be shunned from society and should be stripped of all power.",wiscopup,2025-05-09T19:00:59,2

"It sounds like the legal principle in this federal law related to human smuggling is akin to the point in felony murder in state penal laws. In that instance, if you or another in the commission of a felony or the flight thereafter, cause the death of another party, you’ve committed murder. It’s a common section in criminal law and has withstood many challenges. It moves up the penalty for the deaths because it occurs in the course of a serious crime.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-09T14:34:04,2
