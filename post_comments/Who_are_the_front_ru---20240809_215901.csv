I'm 100% convinced that Vivek Ramaswamy is going to become a future president. Will he be a future president on the 2008 ticket? Unlikely but we'll see.  He's the GOPs Barrack Obama in terms of how smooth he is in conversation and his ability to speak publicly on various topics.  Look at videos of Barrack Obama giving his first major speech at the DNC back in 2004. That is 100% the same kind of energy I get from Ramaswamy when I hear him speak.  The biggest issue that Ramaswamy had when he was running was the extremely religious base of the GOP did not like the fact he was Hindu. He openly confronted a pastor who had criticized his Hinduism at an event during his primary run. It was a peaceful exchange but you could tell this was a non-negotiable issue for the pastor.  I'm of the opinion that Ramaswamy is going to need to convert (even a fake conversion to appease Trump's base) if he wants to gain ground on the national stage. He underestimates how major of a topic religion is amongst GOP voters.,[deleted],2024-08-12T00:40:48,1
