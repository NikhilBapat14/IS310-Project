It’s remarkable that every single Donald Trump idea is inflationary. It’s always higher costs.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-09T12:29:50,26

">President Trump's tariffs are making it a lot more expensive to have kids, parents and baby gear makers say.  >Sweeping levies imposed by Mr. Trump in April are hiking the prices of baby essentials, including car seats and strollers, amounting to a tax on parents, advocates for reducing costs for families say.   >At the same time, the White House is trying to encourage Americans to have more children. Mr. Trump is even considering a $5,000 ""baby bonus,"" according to a New York Times report, to boost the U.S.' declining birth rate.   >New parents and couples that are expecting could soon face tariff-related cost increases of up to $1,000 a year on baby essentials, according to Natalie Gordon, the CEO of Babylist, a baby registry service.  >Gordon noted that price increases are already in effect across a range of products, given manufacturers' reliance on China to produce strollers, cribs, car seats and other required goods. Currently, an import duty of up to 145% applies to U.S. imports from China, where the vast majority of strollers sold in the U.S. are made.   >Mr. Trump on Friday signaled that the rate could come down, writing in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that an ""80% Tariff on China seems right!""",brain_overclocked,2025-05-09T12:26:41,7
My parents are wondering why theres four of us and only two grandbabies between us four. It was already hard enough raising a kid and now tariffs make it just that much worse,blackmobius,2025-05-09T15:04:38,4
Sounds like people should stop having kids until the US decides to quit financially devastating parents.,Present-Perception77,2025-05-09T16:42:21,5

"This is the plan. Its design is to reduce accessibility, financial stability and social supports. In order to increase, hate and disenfranchised behaviour.

What's even more remarkable is that his cult members always believes he is a genius and will be better for the economy and will lower costs.,uhohnotafarteither,2025-05-09T12:54:25,3

They don’t want people to actually keep the kids. They want people so impoverished that they can’t afford the kids and then have to choice but to give them to Catholic Charities to be sold to the highest bidder. That’s what they mean by “ domestic supply of infants”. It’s a $14 billion a year industry. Gotta get their 8 pounds of fresh infant flesh.,Present-Perception77,2025-05-09T16:45:25,3
I love that Doug Funnie’s neighbor Mr. Dink was not only inspired by that group of people but was even named after the acronym “DINK.” He could afford those multiple “very expensive” items because he and his wife had no kids.,Brunt-FCA-285,2025-05-09T18:02:54,3
