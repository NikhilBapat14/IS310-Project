"Nice try. Bessent's answer shows it's futile to think he's any better than the rest:  Bessent, in a statement to CNBC, said:  “It is equal parts odd and sad that a group of people, most of whom I have never met, feel they have standing in my life choices due to a tenuous overlap from 40 years ago.  How very brave of these people to wage their campaign from behind a keyboard rather than to engage in the real-life political process. They should look inward, exercise some agency, and come out from behind their desks—like I did—to get involved in the 2028 electoral cycle.  These are the same close-minded progressives who have sought to undermine President Trump at every turn. But to paraphrase President Teddy Roosevelt, ‘It is not the critic who counts… the credit belongs to the man in the arena.’  President Trump is the man in the arena. And the American people elected him—not these critics. Being part of the Trump Administration and serving the American people is the honor of my lifetime.”",FIlm2024,2025-04-25T21:40:16,5
