There is no such thing as state secret if the defense Secretary actively uses insecure communication channels to communicate actual secrets.,thieh,2025-05-08T19:24:00,240
This is how you know they don’t have anything to justify their actions.,Objective_R_549,2025-05-08T19:24:57,166
Knew THAT was coming.  and no more Alien Enemies Act of 1789 to hide behind boohoo.  SIMPLE: Bring the man back and give him the hearing he's entitled to.  By then Blondi'll be claiming he founded ISIS.,XSinTrick6666,2025-05-08T19:28:13,80

state secrets going to be the next executive privilege,MakeAbortions,2025-05-08T19:44:43,17
The Supreme Court will not be in session again until October so Trump can keep on breaking the law all he wants.  This stuff won't be resolved with any speed just like Trump's prosecutions.  Bondi and The US Marshals will not take any action on trial or appeals ruling.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-08T20:06:16,15
"The state fucked up, and would like it to be a secret. Kinda late though.",CurrentlyLucid,2025-05-08T19:58:15,12
I wonder how dumb trump felt when someone was able to get through to him that the ms13 was photoshopped.,CurrentlyLucid,2025-05-08T19:59:22,10
The amount of how far the government and the fucking president is ready to go and double down just to not have to admit that they’re wrong is fucking insanity.,AiMwithoutBoT,2025-05-08T21:16:07,9

Like I said... These District Judges are being played like middle school hall monitors.,williamgman,2025-05-08T19:44:26,6
"So, here's a thought. If Garcia is being deported for being a gang member, but has no criminal record, that means that simply being a member of a criminal gang warrants some type of government action. So, what about all the domestic gang members?  Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Gangster Disciples , Ghost Face.",MDV441226,2025-05-09T05:56:20,1
"There is no such thing as anything when you're dealing with fascists. That's why the Nazis had to be killed. They were not voted out, they were not protested out, they were not stopped by judges. They were killed until they were forced out of power, because that was the only possible option to get rid of them. They made sure nothing else would work.",SloppyGripe,2025-05-08T20:26:35,74

This is insane to me. I looked it up because it was so hard to believe. What the actual fuck. Normal workers can't even get a few days off and Supreme Court Justice is one of the most important jobs in the country. WHY is it like this?,Wuorg,2025-05-09T02:22:05,8
