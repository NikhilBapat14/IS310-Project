Another day another Democrat hoax to cause faux outrage.    Is that one website still up and keeping track of all of the hoaxes?Â ,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-28T11:41:51,142

"The left complains about separation of children from their parents all the  time.  If the Mother wants or has to go back, do they really want to separate the child from the mother?",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T12:49:10,22

"The left are losing their minds over this right now.  For some unexplainable reason, they can't seem to grasp the fact a parent would insist on taking their children with them when they are deported from the US.   All of them are crowing ""Trump is deporting US Citizen children.. blah blah....""   It's incredible they are so blinded by hate for Trump that they can't bring themselves to admit that no kids were deported.   I read on comment in another sub where some people were saying a parent taking their child out of the country without a hearing is basically kidnapping.  My gosh, the stupidity.",Specific_Bee_4199,2025-04-28T16:57:42,4
"The articles touting alarmist headlines like ""4 year old American citizen has been forcefully deported!"" are just utterly disingenuous gaslighting to an extreme level.  Every single person in the country illegally, OR legally on any temporary student/workvisa who returns to their home country once their visa expires will bring their US citizen kids with them as a matter of routine practice. It's never been controversial. Literally hundreds of thousands of these cases every year going back decades. Under Obama, under Biden, under every president it's been the standard practice when a temporary immigrant leaves the country, they will naturally want their kids to come with them. If you are here legally or illegally (doesn't matter) and you give birth to a US citizen, you will typically bring your US citizen kid with you when you leave the country. The US citizen child isn't being deported, the parent is. The parent has the option to leave their US citizen child in the US if they so choose but who the hell is going to abandon their kid? Seriously? Not many people... some might prefer they stay in the US in the custody of a family member or something if they think their life will be way better, and that's fine... NOBODY IS STOPPING THAT if that's the parents' preference, the child is not being forced to be deported, the parents just prefer their child to come with them of course.   What these articles seem to be implying is that it is some new alarming rights violation that a parent who has a child who is a US citizen is being forced to leave the country. They are implying that because the child cannot be forcefully deported as a citizen, that the parent can't be either. This has never, ever been the case. Obama and Biden deported literally millions of J1 and H1b and other temp visa status people with US citizen kids from the country once their status expired, and all of those people brought their US citizen kids with them back to their home country and it wasn't even remotely controversial. This is just next level gaslighting, a complete debasement of the truth that seeks to outrage low-information voters who don't know any better and just become outraged at seeing a headline that ""a US citizen child was deported!""",TheSleepyTruth,2025-04-28T15:46:38,6

Itâ€™s because they keep saying we are like the same country of many decades ago.Â   News flash we arenâ€™t. You canâ€™t just enter Germany either. Or most countries if you arenâ€™t a citizen.Â   US is tired of it always happening to us.Â ,Infyx,2025-04-28T17:11:37,19

"Saw this headline on another site and didn't even have to click on it to know what actually happened. Came here just now and decided to actually take a look and yeah, of course, it's exactly what I thought.  What's really gross is that ragebait has taught us how to read media completely differently. Anytime Trump's name is in a headline, you can do some predictable ""calculations"" to untwist the disingenuous headline and arrive at what the headline should've been. It's kind of sad that I didn't even realize I was doing that until now",Point-Connect,2025-04-28T15:34:58,7
