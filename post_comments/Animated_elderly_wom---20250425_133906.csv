"Wyoming is a very red state, but there are many of us that live there that see through the BS that is happening in Washington.  An elected official should represent their Country, their Constituents, their Party, and their President.  The Republican Party has flipped this list.",Wyoming_Rocks,2025-04-25T13:55:24,7

"> Following a March town hall in Wheatland, an elderly woman approached Rep. Harriet Hageman and spoke in an “aggressive manner” with her hands close to the representative’s face, a Wheatland Police Department report released to WyoFile this week shows.        Two elderly woman getting into an argument sounds like a Denny’s during the early bird rush hour.",heismanwinner82,2025-04-25T13:47:23,0
"Everyone on here love to say ""The Dems, The Dems, The Dems"", every time Trump does something, but realistically, Republicans need to stop blindly voting along party lines. If something is idiotic, and their constituents clearly don't want it, don't vote for it just because Trump said so.  They are so afraid that their peers in congress wont think their cool anymore, while people in their actual district hate them and they have to walk down the street with security.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T14:40:21,10
