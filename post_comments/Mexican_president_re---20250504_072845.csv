"I'm not even sure they would win honestly  >A U.S. unilateral attack, some observers fear, could return Mexican politics to the gringo-bashing tendency that was once prevalent among Mexican politicians.

"Reminds me of Smedley Butler's time during prohibition. Military types have odd ideas about how to effectively fight crime.  https://www.vfwpost106.org/history-of-smedley-darlington-butler/  > other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city, bandit chasing squads armed with sawed-off shotguns, and armored police cars.  Driving around in armored cars shooting shotguns out of them seems dangerous.",cipheron,2025-05-04T07:40:03,16
Trump wants to send Americans to die so he can say we are in a war... ,ultralightdude,2025-05-04T08:08:49,9

"If trump was serious about taking power away from mexican cartels, the solution is so unbelievably simple and would generate thousands of jobs as well as billions in taxes. Stop the war on drugs. People will do drugs regardless. Legalize everything, regulate it, tax it, and take the main source of income away from organized crime. Anyone remember prohibition?? Alcohol consumption didnt stop, it only strengthened organized crime. Sadly. Terrorist trump and the Republican Terrorist Regime are against freedom of choice, against American jobs, and use ""mexican cartels"" to keep their domestic terrorist base inline with their insane agenda. So none of this will happen",Elon_is_a_Nazi,2025-05-04T09:40:26,4
"Um. Don't want to use our resources to fight issues in other countries, which can heavily impact ours, like illnesses, but you do want to send troops to Mexico over drug cartels?",usernames_suck_ok,2025-05-04T08:19:53,3

"I get why the Mexican president would reject that. Sending US troops into another country to fight drug cartels sounds like a recipe for disaster. Plus, it could lead to a lot of tension between the countries. Mexico probably wants to handle its own issues without outside interference.",HugsCatcher,2025-05-04T09:13:09,2
Likely he was gonna send troops and give a green light on everyone and anyone. Good for her.,vampirepussy,2025-05-04T09:47:21,2
This won't be a problem as soon as I make Mexico the 52nd state. Of course Canada is already begging us to be the 51st state and we're going to make such good deals with Mexico to be the 52nd state that you won't believe it.,TopEagle4012,2025-05-04T07:45:03,2

A proposal in the same sense that this clown promised to get rid of 'criminals' in the country?   A proposal following threats of land claim on Mexico and other sovereign nations?  This is another cover-up for a war Trump wants to drag his country to and grab land.,Hazer_123,2025-05-04T09:33:23,1
Maybe because sending a military to fight a cartel is fucking stupid?,StevesRune,2025-05-04T13:27:56,1
Everyone knows if you have US troops into your country they could stay there for decades. Especially when the victory conditions are as vague as they are for the “war on terror” or in this case the “war on drugs..” This is by design to allow them to exert perpetual military influence on a region.,AlexandersWonder,2025-05-04T15:22:57,1

"Similarly, but not intending to change the subject, if they arrested business owners and CEOs for hiring undocumented immigrants, the _demand_ would dry-up and there would be fewer people trying to enter the US illegally (because there would no longer be underpaying jobs available for them). In both cases, they seem to just want to _prolong_ problems, instead of eliminating root causes (demand), they _benefit_ from.",oldteen,2025-05-04T08:23:54,5

Exactly. Trump is quoted as saying she's so afraid of the cartels she can't even think straight. The reality is she's a puppet allowed to exist by the cartels who have completely captured the Mexican state.,Staycation1234,2025-05-05T09:58:08,1
"Ironically hard drug use is at all time lows, as are alcohol sales. And it's not lack of data - we're better at tracking addicts than we've ever been.   Compare to the 1960s, when every adult was drinking like a fish, smoking like a chimney, and you could get everything from benzos to qualuudes pretty easy.",BabySuperfreak,2025-05-04T08:46:52,7
"You're exactly right and people have been saying this for decades.   If companies weren't allowed to hire cheap labor anytime with no consequences they wouldn't. Since it's the people that get blamed and not the employer there's no reason to not just hire the next immigrant and wait.   It's the same reason companies still steal wages, keep unsafe worksites, engage in insider trading and other illegal actions, etc.",scubahood86,2025-05-04T09:19:39,3
