Very smart of Europe to use the Trump insanity to their advantage.  Europe wins as well as the scientists and researchers who make the move there.,Smithy2232,2025-05-06T07:51:53,20
"Quote: The European Union launched a drive on Monday to attract scientists and researchers to Europe with offers of grants and new policy plans, after the Trump administration froze U.S. government funding linked to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.  “A few years ago, no one would have imagined that one of the biggest democracies in the world would cancel research programs under the pretext that the word diversity was in this program,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at the “Choose Europe for Science” event in Paris.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-06T07:48:31,13
"Another area that the Trump stain will linger for many years to come is the exodus of brain power and advanced knowledge and wisdom for future technology. Not only won't students come to the United States to study during the Trump era, but many who are in the US will find other countries more inviting and appealing.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-06T07:59:00,9
We will be left in the dust of the Dark Ages while Europe and China gleefully snatch up our experts and scientists... And the grad students who follow them - they are the future experts.   Thanks MAGA.,SicilyMalta,2025-05-06T08:20:04,6

"If I could go back and do things over, I'd have gone to school for biology and botany like I intended.   Instead, I chose to shoot heroin for 17 years and be homeless.  Been clean for five years and now help people off of drugs for a living, but jfc.. If only...",KungFuSnafu,2025-05-06T08:27:15,5
"MAGA will cheer and tRump will proclaim, ""We made America great again again""... as those cities America lacking renewable power begin to dim, as more and more fiscal resources are diverted into obsolete technologies left behind when innovation was banished to the rest of the civilized world, and as locally harvested produce is replaced by highly tariffed goods from the foreign places where all those expelled immigrants landed...   All of that pride and faith wasted, in service to the Orange Era of America.  Hey Europe... I hope that you have more wisdom than we had - and hope that you can avoid squandering the blessings that we had for a time, and willingly lost in favor of the glorification of a thoroughly empty soul.

A lot of positions opening up in China and elsewhere in Asia as well.  We used to be the envy of the world for our research institutions but Trump has made them toxic like everything else he touches.,zubbs99,2025-05-06T09:20:55,1
"I’m a scientist but I’m definitely not the top people they would be looking for😅 They probably want to researchers or veterans of their fields, not some manufacturing scientist like me. But glad to see other countries picking up the torch where we fumbled it.",Winter-Huntsman,2025-05-06T10:12:54,1

"Well, considering that he cancelled funding, that brings the amount to $0, so getting more than $0 IS paying more already.",ambigious_meh,2025-05-06T10:42:20,2
People working in tech and science make more money in the US than Europe. The amount isn't 0.,crazysoup23,2025-05-06T10:44:42,-1
