A state agency that is there for its citizens and helps them in emergencies? How can something like this still have its justification in this day and age? Such an agency cannot line the pockets of Trump and his comrades.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-08T15:05:32,15

"> CNN previously reported that Hamilton was given a lie detector test just days after taking part in a meeting with top DHS officials for a policy discussion on the future of FEMA and how to potentially dismantle the agency. That closed-door meeting was reported by CNN and other media outlets. At least a dozen other FEMA officials have also been polygraphed by DHS in recent weeks, primarily for alleged media leaks.  Since when did Maury Povich become president?",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T18:30:15,1
What do you mean fails?  Dude was literally just hired and was asked to dismantle FEMA by Trump and his barbie doll.  He said I don't feel like taking this away from people is a good idea and refused to do so.  He failed to do their dirty work and you know what good for him! He deserves a beer and a high five because Trump and his people are trash.  ,arilupe,2025-05-08T15:14:26,10

This guy spoke up.... good for him.   The next guy is going to be a Fox News person who will turn his/her back on disasters because Trump says so.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T15:34:44,5
Some states were denied FEMA aid after recent natural disasters.,Varesk,2025-05-08T15:11:22,-4

They were just recently denied by Trump himself.  Do some research ,arilupe,2025-05-08T15:16:49,9
And you think that decision comes from the chief of FEMA who got fired one day after he broke with fellow members of the administration when he told lawmakers he does not support dismantling the agency?  Did you even read the article?,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-08T15:17:43,4
Probably one of those read the headlines and go back to worshipping the maga influencers.  ,arilupe,2025-05-08T15:19:23,4
Actually it does to some degree.  FEMA wasn't built to just wait for a command.  There were minimum triggers built into activity and Trump took control of the full list.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T15:35:55,-4
"Exactly, I’m not defending this guy, but you said it yourself, those decisions came directly from Trump who disregarded all protocols.  This guy should be at least applauded for refusing to simply abide to Trump’s desires",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-08T15:42:11,5
I agree with applauding the guy.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T15:53:31,2
