Snyder is one of the greatest living US historians and critics of autocracy. I've read his books *Bloodlands* and On Ty*ranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century.* The latter should be mandatory reading for all high school students.   Never miss a chance to read or hear his comments.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-14T23:10:40,56
