"Thank god, we really didn't need to serve the Georgia senate races to the democrats for a 3rd time in a row with joke candidates.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-09T22:08:25,81
I was hoping that she would run.  She would never get past the primaries and it would get her out of the House.  She's quite an embarrassment for this state.,Gringo-Bandito,2025-05-10T06:48:40,31
Good. Hopefully they can primary a good candidate that can actually win,AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-05-09T20:23:52,51
Too bad Brian Kemp isn’t running. He would easily win. Maybe he’s planning to run for president in 2028 so he’s not going to do the Senate.,Trondkjo,2025-05-10T03:37:01,10

I have also decided to not run for senate.,hercdriver4665,2025-05-10T07:42:24,5
Georgia is already going to hard to win already,AndForeverNow,2025-05-10T06:00:08,3
"What she's finally learning she's only popular in her house district? DNC has AOC, and the GOP has MTG. Neither are electable outside their house district.",jmartin251,2025-05-09T22:46:46,6

So Republicans have who instead?,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-10T12:44:24,1
"She's better as a hypewoman in the House. It'd hurt her brand if she lost an election, but as long as she's in the House, it ""forces"" the media to breathlessly report on everything she says.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-10T01:00:11,-10
This is true but I can’t deny her running against Ossoff would make for some entertaining moments.,jfoughe,2025-05-10T05:43:31,2
Literally just run a lawn chair.,hiricinee,2025-05-10T00:26:30,18
"That’s an ambitious move if true, since he’d have to beat both Vance and Rubio for the nomination, both of which will have strong pedigrees. Senate would be the smart and safe move since he already is popular in Georgia and wouldn’t have to run a national campaign.",MulticamTropic,2025-05-10T08:22:34,5
"AOC is in New York, she could actually get elected if she primaried out Chuck Schumer.",kaguragamer,2025-05-10T08:16:03,11
Being a junior senator is kind of a step back after you have been running a state for 8 years.,Gringo-Bandito,2025-05-10T16:52:25,1
But it is certainly a step above being a failed presidential nominee. ,MulticamTropic,2025-05-10T18:24:17,1
