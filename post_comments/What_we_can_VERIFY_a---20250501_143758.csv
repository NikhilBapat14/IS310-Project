TLDR: not too bad yet but things are slowing down and traffic will be dropping 25% a week. Not a ghost town yet. There was actually a bit of a pickup as people ordered ahead.,bg370,2025-05-01T15:21:47,19
"Exactly what intelligent and sane people thought would happen: shipments are dropping. There was an initial surge as companies tried to get cargo in before tariffs hit, but the projected shipments are dropping hard.  This is 97% Trump’s fault, 2% Republicans in government fault, and 1% the fault of those that elected these idiots.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-01T14:48:35,35
"The pickup was back in March though, no? April was when we started getting pictures of the port being empty.",CassadagaValley,2025-05-01T15:30:08,7
"Don't let Republicans off the hook!  All of them own this. They voted to allow Trump to abuse his tariff powers, meaning they agree with it and don't see it as a problem.   When the inevitable outcome occurs, no quarter should be given toward republicans who enabled and encouraged these damaging and reckless acts against the American people and the country.  We will be in a Republican recession. There will be Republican layoffs, and Republican business closures. Every negative fallout should be tagged at all times with Republican. Make them own the mess they created.",pgm_01,2025-05-01T15:00:25,25
Way more credit needs to go to the people who elected him he said he was going to use tariffs at an unheard of scale and people just ignored it.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T15:06:11,16
Let me counter with: This is 100% Trump's fault. 100% Republicans in government's fault. And 100% the fault of voters who elected them.   Each group you listed shares 100% of the blame for their own respective parts in this mess.   Voters put idiots in place.  Trump is making terrible choices.  GOP reps are allowing him to.   This presidency was a known quantity. We knew exactly what would happen. All of these groups are on the hook in equal measure.,E1M1_DOOM,2025-05-01T17:22:22,10
Fuck those Nazi supporters. Everyone knew trump was going to do this. The Republican voters chose this and deserve the blame.,Impressive_Second516,2025-05-01T15:25:36,9
Isn’t it 100% the fault of the people that elected these idiots?,0x831,2025-05-01T15:57:48,8
"Things I would’ve bought if not for trumps tariffs:   New pair of birks for summer, Pair of dr martens, $30 mascara, Replaced unnecessary skin care, Spring work clothes, Potentially a new car, Gold necklace I’ve been eyeing, Booked a vacation - possibly two   And more   I’m not rich, me and my partner are dinks. I don’t need any of the shit listed so obviously all is fine and all in all anti consumerism is better for the planet anyway but obviously no consumer spending is bad for the economy. I’m sure I’m not the only one pulling back.  So yep exactly what we all knew would happen",loud-oranges,2025-05-01T14:58:00,7
This is 97% the fault of those who voted for him or who didn't vote.  Trump is a known entity.  People voted for this.,YesterShill,2025-05-01T16:33:35,2
Bullshit. Trump couldn't do any of this if he didn't win the election. He told us what he was going to do. Trump voters are no less than 100% to blame.,Equal-Membership1664,2025-05-01T16:23:09,2
No fuck republicans and voters. This is their fault!,isaidscience,2025-05-01T23:44:15,1
"It’s 100% the fault of the American people for failing in the basic civic duty to act as a guardrail against this lunacy. It happened because they are willing to vote for and support anti-democratic practices and policies, so long as they hurt the ‘right’ people, and that’s far from a new thing.",sylbug,2025-05-02T14:30:52,1
"> The Seaport Alliance said port traffic in Seattle is up 7.3% in the last 30 days. The port saw an 18.4% increase in volumes in March, partially driven by shippers moving cargo before anticipated tariffs.",bg370,2025-05-01T15:33:40,5
"I was going to order a Civic (wanted a specific color combo), but they said they couldn't lock in the pre-tariff price.",cliff99,2025-05-01T15:02:15,6
It will be interesting to see the numbers for April.,2_Sheds_Jackson,2025-05-01T15:38:32,1
