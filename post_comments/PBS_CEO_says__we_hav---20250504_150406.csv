"Yep. This is the first time a candidate ran for US president as a convicted criminal who attempted a coup, promised to rule as a dictator, and won.

People believe what they want to believe.   If people believe that Jesus sent Trump to the US because the US is God‚Äôs chosen nation then they will believe just about anything.   They accuse Biden of associating with Jeffrey with no evidence and ignore all the evidence that shows Trump and Jeffrey were very close. Even when Trump says they were very close. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  It‚Äôs all insanity.,TruthSearcher1970,2025-05-05T10:02:21,5
