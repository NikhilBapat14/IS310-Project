Trump is a convicted felon and an unregistered sex  offender.  His criminal activities and sexual perversions didn't matter to voters. He could drive a Mac Truck through a crowd 5th Ave and it would be Biden's fault.,FuTuReShOcKeD60,2025-03-30T10:28:28,7

"Man, he could be on video strangling babies with his bare hands and MAGA would still support him and come up with some spin about why their lord and saviour Trump was in the right.
