It was always going to be like this.,justaheatattack,2025-05-01T15:17:11,3
Forget any help from inhabitants if Trump tries to send combat troops in another country.  They know any promises from the lying US leadership are empty.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-01T15:30:37,3
But yet Muslims didn’t vote because of ‘uncommitted’ so they own this as well. The Iman in Dearborn endorsed Trump. Those Muslim knew that the Afghan refugees would be deported. They fucking knew it but didn’t care.,Pleaseappeaseme,2025-05-01T14:50:06,2
"It's amazing how badly ruined the image of America (already on shaky ground since the Bush administration, at least) has become under Trump.  The rest of the world is going to regard Americans as cowards, fools, losers, whiners, assholes, and sycophants for *decades*. It will take generations to undo the damage.",Logical_Hare,2025-05-01T16:52:42,2
"That can't be blamed on the refugees themselves, though. *They* certainly didn't get to vote in the last election.",Logical_Hare,2025-05-01T14:56:31,7
"Those ""uncommitted"" types seriously lack in any intellectual depth or pragmatism other than ""America bad, Israel bad"".",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-01T16:05:02,4
Yep. The people that voted in Trump. They knew 95% of this stuff could happen. Are the Iman’s American friends all cheering these deportations on now? I hope not. But maybe they are? I really don’t know.,Pleaseappeaseme,2025-05-01T15:41:15,1
