"Ok seriously, what the fuck is this shit?  Now the regime is demanding foreign cities cut DEI for their contractors?  This is next level bullying.  Who would even think of such a thing?  This shit is bananas.",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-05-07T13:21:48,54

"I got a good laugh out of this one. They have an embassy on our city’s soil, basically being guests in our country, and have the embarrassing gall to make demand that ”everyone who does business with the embassy” comply with their alt right agenda, or else…  or else what? Take their Swedish embassy elsewhere? Stop using our roads to get around? Yell at people walking by? What is the threat? It’s ridiculous!   I hope they make good of their word and cut of their own water supply to the embassy and stop using the woke electricity from our wind farms. This is beyond childish.   If they wanna play world police at least go back to acting tough against Putin instead of us who just want to be left alone. Pricks",Tegurd,2025-05-07T14:20:06,9

"I guess the administration doesn’t understand that most of the world doesn’t tolerate diversity programs, but celebrates them.  I find it telling that we’ve only heard these demands being sent to European countries. Imagine sending a demand to a country like Kenya saying that they need to fire any white people that were hired under diversity programs.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-07T14:19:37,8
