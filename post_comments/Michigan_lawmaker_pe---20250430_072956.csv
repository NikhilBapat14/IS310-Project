It got the message across in a non-violent way. The other (GOP) representative took her parking space to be a prick and knew he wasn't going to be penalized for doing so. She is straight up Gen Xer and was raised at a time when pranks served as sending a message. She's not serving as a politician just to roll over for the pricks.,_C2J_,2025-04-30T07:50:54,6
