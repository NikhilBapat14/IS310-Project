"Apropos. It's time to economically de-couple from your enemy.  China can make all the arguments they want about Taiwan being an ""integral part of China."" It hasn't been since 1895....that's 130 years folks, over a 100 years longer than Ukraine has been separated from Russia. But it's the South China Sea where we really get to witness Beijing's imperial ambitions. China has no historic claim to the Paracel or Spratley Islands.....they just took them....in defiance of International Court rulings. It is an outlaw regime whose paradigm of mass surveillance and mass repression may indeed become the model for mankind if they're not stopped. In other words, Taiwan is MORE than just about Taiwan....defending it is a mechanism to rid the world of the CCP and the totalitarian monstrosity that it represents.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-25T20:04:04,10
