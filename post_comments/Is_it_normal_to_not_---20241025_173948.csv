"I relate to that, and I’d say just focus line by line on your ballot. Don’t focus too much on party membership or endorsements, just research the candidates and issues case by case and vote that way. I’m a Democrat, but I don’t vote for a ballot measure or a candidate just because the Democratic Party endorses them. I need more info than that, and I promote others requiring more info before voting as well. Blindly voting with party is not necessarily constructive",duke_awapuhi,2024-10-27T17:10:43,3
"There is a major political shift happening right now at the politician level that the American people haven't caught up with yet. Democrats have been losing on the far left and have been winning with traditionally republican ideas. I think everyone can see the Democrats are no longer for the working class, though they still claim that is the case, most of us can feel and see that their actions are more in line with corporate interest and foreign intervention.   Oddly, Trump being annointed by the Republican party has introduced another falsehood, that the republican party is now the peace and middle class party. Trump was always a democrat, and he didn't change with the democratic party of the past 20 years. I would classify trump as an independent, because his actions and viewpoints are all over the place, some very liberal and some very conservative - the issue is what is liberal and what is conservative is changing.   At its core, liberalism = progress, always changing, and conservatism = don't fix what isn't broke.   The issue is when the norm has changed so much (we are in massive debt, deficit spending is normalized, we are involved in nearly every conflict for the past 20 years) the parties are starting to change as well. Conservatives are the biggest change imo, as they have realized they don't like the norm, and are advocating for a return to a golden age (I'd say 90s was the best time ever in America, I'm not 300 years old though so could be wrong :D) while liberals are advocating for progress in increasingly narrow ways (see anything LGBT related). One party is in general playing emotions, and one is playing reality - but thats too simple, because emotions are driven by reality.   It appears to me that neither party is doing things for the majority of Americans, and the research certainly agrees with that fact - the largest voting bloc in the country is non-affiliated voters (independents) because I think we have evolved past the idea that whatever someone says on TV must be accurate.   The hyperbolic vilification of political anything has gotten old, nobody really likes it, and the overwhelming majority of people just want to be able to take care of their family and be left alone. That's probably why you and most Americans don't identify with a party - most of the things they focus on just don't matter to most people.",Wolfbeerd,2024-10-29T10:50:39,1
I think politics is more nuanced than most media would have us believe. I actually made a free little tool ( [https://voteinformer.org](https://voteinformer.org) ) that does something similar to isidewith but uses publicily available voting records to show you which politicians support the policies you care about. It's meant to be more grounded in the real measurable decisions made in congress than other similar tools. I'm very curious if you would find the results more or less useful than other sites!,qetion,2024-11-03T20:42:45,1
"I would say yes, because the Democratic Party is far more conservative than people realize. It’s kind of funny hearing people calling themselves progressive voting for Biden/Harris. One could argue the GOP is more progressive with Trump. Harris maybe farther left than the Clinton/Carville 90’s democrats, but she isn’t running on that now. Anyone know what she is running on? When you see Romney, Cheney’s and other popular conservatives endorsing Harris it makes sense. Democrats have become the status quo. I’m not arguing this is a bad thing or a good thing. My point is our political parties are shifting ideologically. This happened in the mid 1800’s when democrats used to be conservative, and republicans liberal. It is tough to tell if it will completely turn. Will have to see what happens after Trump.",[deleted],2024-10-27T01:05:52,0
"I have a theory that Trump is causing a major political realignment, where the Democratic Party is becoming the party of ""Normalcy"" (Politics pre 2017) and the Republican Party is becoming fusion of the Bernie Bros and indepents.  Do I think Trump is doing this consciously? No. Do I think Trump is even all that different materially? Not really. If he was he could've started his own party while in office.   Overall I think the absorbing of the Republicans who couldn't follow Trump is going to make the democratic party more right wing, leaving room for experimentation with some more left wing ideas in the Republican parties. Do I think these ideas will be particularly successful? I'm not sure.",CivilWarfare,2024-10-27T23:56:16,2
"Biden at least in a lot of domestic areas has been relatively progressive. It wasn’t expected, and he’s still not overwhelmingly progressive, but on paper we’re looking at the most progressive administration since LBJ. It’s not a left wing admin by any means, but it is more progressive in American terms than what we’ve been seeing for decades.",duke_awapuhi,2024-10-27T17:08:46,1
"Couldn't disagree more.  [https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en)  While I will share in the idea in the link that the elected individuals are indeed holding far more polarized views, the American public has not shown the same move.  In the rather large paper linked, they mention conservatives becoming slightly more progressive as a whole, but the polarization of viewpoint is still growing, because of a quicker move to the left by the liberals.  As I understand my reading, it is not the democratic party that is going to absorb right wing policy ideas, but the conservative party that is currently absorbing those that can't follow the far more liberal ideas their elected (or installed if talking of Kamala) officials propose.  This can of course be arugued to be going both ways, but there would need to be a larger trend towards conservatives for the polarization gap stuff to work out.  All in all, I do think that the individuals that are feeling ""Forced"" to switch parties is going to be a net positive for the entire system. Their willingness to cross over once will help us all be less partisan and more American!

"Biden, who said, ""When it comes to civil rights and civil liberties, I’m a liberal but that’s it. I’m really quite conservative on most other issues.”   I've read some of these articles saying he has been the most progressive since LBJ or FDR. This claim is misleading. While it's easy to find many things he did it doesn't make him SO progressive. The Federal Govt is a lot bigger than it has ever been. POTUS also has more power than prior centuries.

"I'm at work so I can't address this is in its entirety, but my point is here   > As I understand my reading, it is not the democratic party that is going to absorb right wing policy ideas, but the conservative party that is currently absorbing those that can't follow the far more liberal ideas their elected (or installed if talking of Kamala) officials propose.  For now this might be the case soe. Anti-trump conservatives might become less antagonistic twords some progressive policies this cycle, but this might just mean that the Democratic Party will begin to field more conservative candidates as a whole to appeal to this voting bloc.",CivilWarfare,2024-10-28T14:26:05,1
Agreed! I very much think that both sides will likely start to consider some policy or candidate choices that are with a lean towards moderates! Especially at the local and state levels!,Whitetailnh,2024-10-28T14:33:27,1
