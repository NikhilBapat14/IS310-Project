What are the Democrats doing about it?!? Hand wringing? Sending out fundraising emails and texts?,VAW123,2025-04-13T15:32:51,3
Can someone explain to me why every state doesn’t just switch to EDL’s which prove citizenship? Wouldn’t that address the “issue” and still keep voting relatively free?,Serious-Agency8263,2025-04-13T14:27:02,2

It's Trump's party's bill. It's literally what they voted for.  Yes it sucks for all women but we (or democrats) didn't inflict this on anyone.,Ok_Condition5837,2025-04-13T14:26:06,3
"Yep, tyranny of the minority .  The American Right wimg has the longest history of suppressing voter turnout regardless of political party affiliation",FreedomsPower,2025-04-14T13:12:03,1
"Hmmm well considering it needs 60 votes in the senate to pass, I'd imagine every fucking democrat is gonna vote no, thus killing the bill",FickleSystem,2025-04-13T15:57:12,5
EDL?  What's that?,ShirBlackspots,2025-04-13T14:50:29,1
"Unless you are given a driver's license at birth, don't see how this solves it.  EDLs are only granted in 5 states to allow for easier border crossing. Even a Real ID wouldn't be accepted under the save act.  IIRC still need a birth certificate to and you still have to take the time to go to the DMV.  Voting is already free, it's a right and  fraud or non-citizens voting are rare.",jrstriker12,2025-04-14T07:12:04,1

"It's 53 republicans and the two independents vote with dems....so republicans would need 7 dems to vote yes, which isn't happening",FickleSystem,2025-04-13T17:12:24,3
"I completely forgot about the debate vote, yeah you’re right, as long as that vote does not reach 60 we’re good",Mr-Rotmound,2025-04-13T18:15:32,3
Consider how Republicans fillibustered everything they could  during both Obama and Biden administrations.   Doing back to them is fair game,FreedomsPower,2025-04-14T13:09:46,1
