"No there is not, US parties can't stop that; the most they can do is tell people to vote against the person and deny them party funds/support.  One notable case that occurred was from this guy, a neonazi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_J._Jones",zlefin_actual,2024-08-30T10:13:03,1
">former Labour leader Jemrey Corbyn was disallowed from contending the general election on a Labour ticket  Disallowed by whom? I'm guessing the party?  Parties are private organisations/businesses. They are not actual public institutions or formally integrated into the governance structures or constitution; to the best of my knowledge.  So, who can run on their ticket, I presume, is guided by their own party constitution, just like the running of any association or club; it would differ, then, from party to party.  The only thing is that their operations should not, I would think, contravene any superior laws -- perhaps some election laws -- just like any other organisation is subject to laws on discrimination, contracts etc.  So it would boil down to what reasons were given.",fletcher-g,2024-08-30T13:11:11,1
