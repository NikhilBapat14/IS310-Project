"This may be the first time I agree with Ann Coulter.   I do feel like we have a toddler we must appease similar to Kim Jong in the Whitehouse. He wins all the golf championships, he's incredibly physically fit , his staff goes round the table and strokes his ... ego.     It reminds me of the classic Twilight Zone episode with the nasty spoiled kid who could ""wish people into the cornfield.""   We love you Anthony. You're such a good boy. You are so smart. Lets play tariff and make little Anthony happy...  But , tariffs are ruining...  Shhhh!!  Do you want him to wish you into the cornfield? Look what happened to those lawyers who stood up for the constitution! Now let's listen to YMCA again before he gets pissy.   https://youtu.be/QxTMbIxEj-E  >Dan (Don Keefer) reaches his breaking point inside the isolated midwestern town where six-year-old Anthony Fremont (Bill Mumy) controls everything - including Dan's grotesque fate.
