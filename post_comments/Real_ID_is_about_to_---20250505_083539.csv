It has been phased in over the last 20 years. The only thing actually going into effect is the part about needing it to fly on planes even within the US and entering Federal Buildings.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:41:12,58
"Just over five years ago, I renewed my California driver's license using the state's DMV website. A question popped up about whether I wanted a Real ID or state ID. I chose the Real ID. I didn't receive any other instructions at all apart that I could print out the temporary ID and receipt.   So, I brought that to the local DMV (along with all necessary paperwork). I stood in the long lines (normal for California) and waited four hours to speak with the DMV rep -- only to be told that their ""system isn't ready yet."" They said that their system wouldn't even recognize that I chose a ""Real ID"" (despite my receipt and paperwork) because there were ""issues"" in the system. They advised me to make an appointment for a Real ID and return another day.  Prior to my last birthday, I needed to renew my license again. Again, I selected the ""Real ID."" I was given an appointment date and instructions of what to bring. I showed up to the appointment (which still requires a wait time of a couple of hours in the Bay Area/Silicon Valley DMVs). However, this time, they stated that I had waited too long to bring in my paperwork.   I told them that I only selected the first available appointment during checkout (via the DMV website). The DMV worker said, ""Oh. Yeah, it's not a good website."" He then said that their system wasn't working properly. He advised me to make another appointment over the phone or at the desk (which would require waiting in line for two hours to them be sent to the appropriate counter). So, I left. I was mailed the non-Real ID.   Now, I will have to go through this hassle and pay for another license and hope for the best.   A Real ID shouldn't be so difficult to obtain. I suppose that it isn't so problematic in most states as it is in California -- particularly areas like the Silicon Valley. During the pandemic, my wife stood in an outdoor DMV line but was told to take pics of her paperwork using her cellphone. It worked. By the time we arrived to the door, we simply paid and went home.",chrismireya,2025-05-05T09:42:39,17

Something tells me the media will do everything they can to make this an anti-Trump issue despite Real ID having been formalized long before he was ever in office.  This article mentions in detail paragraphs deep but I suspect most news outlets won't even do that much.,ChewieWookie,2025-05-05T10:42:58,8
"Should we really need a RealID to fly?   It's been 20 years since the law was signed by Bush, and in that time, what has happened that could have been prevented by requiring airline passengers to have a RealID? If there is no good answer to this question then this seems like government overreach to me.  Also, can we talk about the fact that you need to bring more paperwork to get a RealID than a passport??? You even need to show more than you need to get Global Entry, you know, the program where you basically skip US customs, the process meant to stop terrorism, illegal activity, and smuggling from occurring through air travel",Just_Confused1,2025-05-05T15:13:03,4
It'll be interesting if this is used for voting. Real ID is not considered proof of citizenship by the Federal Government. It is only considered proof of \*identify\* which is different  Only your birth certificate and passport are proof of citizenship.,hearing_anon,2025-05-05T14:46:49,5

Agreed. My DL has had that gold star in the last several states I’ve lived in for 12 years now. This isn’t the big impacting change everyone thinks it is.,ITrCool,2025-05-05T09:34:39,30

"Real ID isn’t always difficult.  I’m in Florida, renewed in abut 2012 and did the Real ID then.  Gathered up my birth certificate and whatever, made appointment.  I go inside, check in.  Since I had an appt they saw me in a few minutes, lines were about 20-30min for walk ins, which is a long line for us.   They do their thing, check my eyesight - print my DL and I’m just in maybe 15 minutes.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T11:00:26,12
"I am in CA and have had a RealID for as long as I can remember. And I have not had any issue. Last renewal I had to do all online. And again, no issue.  Not saying DMV or CA is good. But it sounds more like a specific area/person issue.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-05T13:52:40,7
I got my real id over five years ago in California with zero issue. There was a long line of people and someone came out to verify if we had the right paperwork so we didn’t waste our time in line if we didn’t. Several people had the wrong papers and left. I got mine that day and have renewed it since.  It wasn’t hard at all.,yespleasethanku,2025-05-05T15:02:29,5

Same for my wife in Georgia and mine from Oklahoma (was active duty so updating to Real ID was merely a preemptive convenience). When I got my OK license renewed I was asked in person about the real ID option not even knowing it was even an option yet. Her GA license simply went from a regular to a real ID without even asking during renewal.  Cost the same as a regular ID and we were in and out in about the average times.,Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-05T11:43:02,5
Nice. I suspect that the Florida DMV is much better and more efficient than the California DMV. I'd rather go to the dentist than the California DMV. Our DMV's civilian workforce never seems interested or motivated in their jobs. I've been to the DMV in other states -- and they are better.,chrismireya,2025-05-05T11:09:53,4

"In which city was your DMV?   My wife had no problems -- but I think that this was because the pandemic limited the influx of people getting a Real ID. She never actually went into the DMV (in Redwood City) until the final step (including payment). They allowed her to upload her documents from the line.   The DMV in Santa Clara and Redwood City have been, for me, nothing less than quagmires. Of course, my issue wasn't that I didn't have everything necessary. It's that I applied for a license renewal online, selected ""Real ID"" and then the local DMV didn't sync with the state DMV website.  Hopefully, it will be fixed soon. I hope to get mine a little later in the month. It's a shame because my ""non-federally compliant"" California driver's license is good until late 2029.",chrismireya,2025-05-05T18:24:49,2
"The Silicon Valley is extremely expensive (arguably higher costs of living in my town of Palo Alto than NYC). It's more expensive than the two cities, San Francisco and San Jose, on opposite sides of the peninsula. However, it is the weather and proximity toward nature that makes it so alluring (alongside tech industry jobs).   We don't have children yet; so, my wife and I spend our weekends outdoors. We bike the San Francisco Bay Trail. We hike various trails on the ocean or mountains. We're a relatively short day trip from Yosemite, Tahoe, Lassen, Sequoia, Big Sur, Point Reyes, Muir Woods, etc. We camp in many of the local state parks -- as well as parks we can reach in a day.   On my last birthday, we climbed Lassen Peak, the volcano in Lassen Volcanic National Park. On the birthday before that, we climbed the cables to the top of Half Dome in Yosemite. Last weekend, we spent Saturday at the tidal pools at Bean Hollow State Beach and Sunday afternoon hiking Devil's Slide and Grey Whale Trail in Pacifica.   So, I would say that we live in a beautiful area that has essentially been harmed by liberal politicians' liberal policies.",chrismireya,2025-05-06T07:37:10,1

"True, but they also cost more to get, and require just as much if not more documentation to get, generally aren't issued the same day, and expire roughly after the same amount of time as most states real IDs do...
