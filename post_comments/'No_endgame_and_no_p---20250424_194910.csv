Does anyone actually think that Trump ever had a plan?  He reacts to things like a sugar addled 5 year old.   No plan beyond his initial emotional reaction.,killjoygrr,2025-04-24T19:55:27,20

The game is to tank the markets and buy stocks on the cheap and then create false hopes so that they can dump the stocks to make a killing. Rinse and repeat.,Available_Ad9766,2025-04-25T03:32:49,2

I think his idea was to have tariffs become like a national sales tax and eventually eliminate income taxes.  This would mean that a majority of the taxes would be paid by people other that the top 10% earners.  This is the overall goal to make the rich richer.,NAU80,2025-04-25T05:25:50,1
Yet another slam/blast against Trump with 0 action actually holding him or his administration accountable. Guess we are going to wait until things are completely irreparably damaged to finally start putting forward motions for impeachment/removal from office. I’m not even going to hold my breath on there actually being criminal charges.,Living_Possession_18,2025-04-25T06:57:01,1
We are juat witnessing the DoD method applied to finance and trade. There never is an endgame or plan. Warfighting for the sake of warfighting,ggaassghd677,2025-04-25T06:58:18,1
The plan is under the table money to enrich himself when these people come to smooch his behind.,Steve120988,2025-04-25T12:29:27,1
I'm pretty sure his plan has always been to steal the tariff money.,Purify5,2025-04-24T20:50:03,8
"The funny thing is that Trump could have won the trade war.  Trade with the United States *was* essential, and there *were\are* a bunch of countries willing to do almost anything for access to American Markets.  But... Vietnam capitulated immediately and agreed to give Trump whatever he wanted!  Only, Trump never asked for anything more and still tariffed Vietnam!  Canada and Japan both have sent delegates to figure out concessions they're willing to grant the United States and... there is NOBODY to negotiate with, and no concessions asked to remove those tariffs!  People are trying to give the United States a win, and Trump is refusing!    It seems like the tariffs **were the goal** with a weird, ONLY THE USA CAN PUT TARIFFS, NOBODY ELSE CAN mentality.",kia75,2025-04-24T21:47:40,3
"His plan was tarrifs, the endgame was to make America great. The way we are going to get there is tarrifs, because they will fix everything and are like magic money other countries give us for being American heroes.   You say egg prices are too high? Well I say they are too low. Your basically getting a bunch of chickens and having their bodies smashed into super protein goop with chicken science. If that isn’t worth 5 dollars an egg I don’t know what is… for that price I’ll even let you call them fancy words like “groceries”.",seanb4games,2025-04-25T05:58:09,1
"Let me touch that up. Ever notice how he uses 'but' when it's not followed by a counterpoint?      We’re looking at things, but there’s lots of things that a lot of good people are looking at and we’ll let you know in two weeks but there’s going to be a lot of good numbers and we’re looking closely at those numbers.",[deleted],2025-04-25T09:47:43,1

Tariffs will go to rich people including himself,jcouball,2025-04-24T21:18:48,3
"Nah. What you are seeing are actions to try to prevent immediate collapses of businesses.   What he is doing is the equivalent of sitting down at a chess match and just flipping the table over.   It screws everybody over, and what you are seeing are responsible leaders trying to reduce the immediate impact. Markets will adjust over time and they will not be to America’s favor, as tarriffs never really achieve that.",killjoygrr,2025-04-24T21:51:48,1

"""Do something or else I blow the both of us up"" is a shitty, but viable negotiation stance.  People did go out of their way to negotiate out of this shitty arrangement, and Trump could have gotten a lot from it.  It would have been temporarily, because once someone threatens to blow you up, you go out of your way to prevent that from happening, but at least in the short term, Trump could have gotten some useful deals and claimed a win.     Instead, Trump, after getting a bunch of potential concessions, decided to blow up everybody anyway, despite there being no benefit or way to win from the blow-up!",kia75,2025-04-24T22:49:58,2
