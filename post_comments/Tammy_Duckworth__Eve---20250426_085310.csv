"Susan Rice essentially said that Hegseth was ""[dumb as a rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVH2rLcuqEY)"".   I think the former national security adviser was being a tad unfair to rocks.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-26T10:30:38,24
Where does Trump come up with these dumb shit,Comfortable_Stick264,2025-04-26T11:43:52,11
What does this lady know? She certainly never served her country!   --every dumbass Maga dude who actually really didn't serve their country,alg45160,2025-04-26T16:59:17,8
She’s 100% right.  But it sounds like Trump is alright with rolling the dice and seeing if he causes any deaths.,HereWeGo5566,2025-04-26T19:10:31,3

He is wholly unqualified for the Sec Def job…. Most of us knew this well before he was confirmed …,TommyDaComic,2025-04-26T17:12:34,2
"My biggest fear is that 20 or 30 U.S. soldiers will go out on a mission, and their target or their enemy will be warned in advance of the attack by Hegseth's incompetence, and we will wind up with either 20-30 POW or KIA Americans.  I really hope the U.S. Military manages to get rid of him before this happens.",dragnabbit,2025-04-26T17:27:19,2
My nephew JUST got done with his stint in the Army. I am so grateful he's not enrolled now.,Justsayyeth,2025-04-26T18:30:51,2
The closest Hegseth gets to any kind of OPSEC is trying to hide his drinking. And we see how bad he is at that!,raistlin65,2025-04-26T19:18:58,2
"It's not even just the security clearances. It's the knowledge that our security is in such Jeopardy.    Our Ally forces do not have confidence in sharing information with our military, all because of American white supremacy. We're sliding into a racist authoritarianism, essentially naziism, and every country can see this.    The only route out of this would be Nuremberg style trials for all of these crimes. Hegseth, Bondi, Miller, Trump... Of them. If an example isn't made soon, if they aren't arrested and tried soon, we may lose our country.",5050Clown,2025-04-27T15:52:49,2
He doesn't care.  Just cannon fodder to him.  Idiots who volunteered to be poor.  Get them killed?  They are soldiers.  That's what they are for.  To die for his glory.    He's scum.,brothersand,2025-04-27T11:39:07,2
