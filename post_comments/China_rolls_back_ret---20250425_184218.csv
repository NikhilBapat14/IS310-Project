"Last year, China imported $11.7 billion worth of semiconductors from the US, according to customs data. Compared to the total tariffs... Does not seem like a huge number.",williamgman,2025-04-25T19:09:07,2

China rolls back some tariffs after weeks of grandstanding. Non-chinese citizens begin the damage control in the comments ,Bruben32,2025-04-26T00:43:44,0
"LOL, they're rolling back tariffs on the stuff that they need but can't be made in China.  The stuff they HAVE to buy, regardless of the price.    This is the 4D chess moves people always claim Trump is doing.  It benefits China, and it allows Trump to pretend he has a win!",kia75,2025-04-25T18:46:50,8

"They're not rat fucking their supply chain like Trump is doing to the US.  They'll import goods, manufacture, and turn around and sell to the rest of the world. To do otherwise is stupid and shooting yourself in the foot.",CockBrother,2025-04-25T20:48:12,2
"> general sentiment is that this trade war will smoke out bad businesses in China who either failed or couldn’t diversify their customer base away from the US  Wait a minute. This sounds like a positive thing. Is that correct? But if America is winning, why does it sound like a good thing for China?   > also help businesses with vulnerable supply chains identify the exact pain points to find alternatives or relay the issue back to their central or local governments for central planning and investment to create domestic alternatives.  Again, this seems to make Chinese companies even stronger than before. Why is that a good thing for us to be helping China with?",xibeno9261,2025-04-25T20:56:08,2
