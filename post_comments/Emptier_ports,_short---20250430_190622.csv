"> With demand for goods from China to the U.S. sinking fast, cargo carriers have slashed capacity to keep ocean freight rates from cratering. In April, there were about 80 canceled sailings from China to the U.S., roughly 60% more than any month during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to figures cited by John McCown, a veteran industry executive. >  > ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a fair statement to say that the container shipping sector has never faced the sort of macro headwinds that it is now facing,‚Äù McCown said in a recent research note.",tech57,2025-04-30T19:12:40,13

"I've been seeing more and more calls for a general strike recently..  It‚Äôs not happening. People are broke, scared, and stuck. They're too worried about keeping a roof over their heads and feeding their children to risk their paycheck.  If we all wait for a general strike to come and solve all our problems, nothing is ever going to happen.  There‚Äôs another option, and its something that *you* can do *literally today* without actually really impacting your livelihood: **simple sabotage**.  The OSS (precursor to the CIA) trained people on how to ratfuck governments and corporations from the inside during WW2, and [their handbook is available here on Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/26184/pg26184-images.html).  Essentially: Work slower. Follow every pointless rule (and make new ones if you're able). Start office drama. ‚ÄúMisunderstand‚Äù orders. Drown everything in meetings. Lose paperwork. Be a burden. Be a roadblock. Be dead weight. Do everything you can to just make things a bit worse every day.  Big flashy strikes can get crushed - especially now that you cannot depend on labor laws to be there to protect you. Simple sabotage guts the system from the inside, and it is practically transparent on the individual level. ""I'm not a shit employee, the process is just important.. how about we all meet for a few hours next week to think about better ways of doing things.""  It‚Äôs not heroic. It‚Äôs not pretty.  But it works.  Death by a thousand cuts still kills.",absentmindedjwc,2025-05-01T00:06:00,3

"It is interesting that Biden was much more of a working class president than Obama or Clinton, and that for millennials and younger. He is definitely the most working class president.  However, after he left office the Democrats performed essentially the worst they ever have with labor.  I think the Democrats should be more pro labor and can do more. At the same time Labor needs to be more pro labor, it's crazy how people are putting the culture war in front of their own livelihood at unprecedented levels.

You and I both know that. But can you blame them for rolling the dice?   And yeah, they fall for the racists and bigoted blame game the republicans espouse, but that‚Äôs because the republicans are the only ones telling them something is wrong. This was pointed out in the election post mortem when people were discussing the effectiveness of trump‚Äôs anti-trans ad- it appealed across all groups, even ones in which people don‚Äôt really have a problem with trans people. Why? Because it at least acknowledged the way they feel about the state of things.

Trump did not hide what what his plan was. Heck, Project 2025 spelled everything out in 900+ pages for the world to read.  If hating trans people and immigrants was the 2024 voter's priority over their own jobs and financial well-being...they made their choice.
