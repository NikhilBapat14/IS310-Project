Because of this idiot my friend almost lost his son due to a butchered mission. He is really putting lives at stake here.,noforgayjesus,2025-05-05T18:03:58,1

Sorry to hear that.   How is this related to Hegseth?,theRealRudewing,2025-05-05T19:38:07,0
"Compromised mission, could not get more details about it really.",noforgayjesus,2025-05-05T19:47:48,1
"Ok, but with all due respect, you made a claim that your friend’s son nearly died because of Hegseth, when it really has nothing to do with him.",theRealRudewing,2025-05-05T19:51:06,-2
"The thing with leadership in the military is you delegate authority, but responsibility always rests with the top dog. So even if ole Heg did everything right and a soldier committed suicide it’s still his fault.  That’s owning leadership, if he couldn’t handle the heat he should stayed on Fox News talking a good talk.",orfed,2025-05-06T01:52:24,1
"I get that, but I guess—foolishly—I expected OP was going to share a story that was relevant to the topic at hand, not just incidentally related to Hegseth.",theRealRudewing,2025-05-06T06:59:41,1
"Solid point, plenty of actually confirmed crazy shit going around. No need to spread the gossips",orfed,2025-05-06T18:32:40,2
