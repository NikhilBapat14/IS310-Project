"From the article:       The committee’s FEC filing did not include spending details, but funds raised by an inaugural committee are traditionally used to pay for opening ceremonies, the parade, galas and balls. This year, the committee had to scale back many of the festivities because of freezing temperatures, moving the swearing-in indoors [from outside of the Capitol ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/17/senate-confirmation-hearings-kristi-noem-dhs-secretary/?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template)and canceling the traditional parade. The committee has broad discretion over how it repurposes the leftover funds, which can be donated to a presidential library or events like the White House Easter Egg Roll.",washingtonpost,2025-04-24T08:13:45,1
