10-1 he tries to pause again,SoulStoneSeeker,2025-04-28T00:51:49,42
"He’ll deliver beautiful deals, deals like never seen before. People say to him “sir, make me a beautiful deal as well “ with tears I their eyes.",jimboiow,2025-04-28T00:51:17,24
This just in...  He's not smart enough to understand that the US is nothing without its allies.,PraiseTheRiverLord,2025-04-28T01:08:37,16
"What pressure?  He put the tariffs on, he paused them.  He can pause them again.  He can end this, but won't until someone finds him a way to save face and not look as stupid as he is.",Caraes_Naur,2025-04-28T01:03:41,13
China has just approved a large number of additional Australian abattoirs for exporting meat to China.,Wollandia,2025-04-28T01:04:25,11
"Guys, he's already made over 200 amazing best trade deals ever! What's there to worry about? No you can't ask for details.   It doesn't matter that there's only 195 countries in the world. He's just that good. He showed those penguins not to mess with America.",crestroncp3user,2025-04-28T01:00:19,8
I doubt anyone knows whether the tarriffs are paused or not. Too hard to keep track.,backpackwayne,2025-04-28T00:51:00,6
I expect him to announce big beautiful deals that don’t actually exist and move on from the subject telling us what a wonderful job he did.,Naive_Inspection7723,2025-04-28T01:15:51,6
I'm not in the least bit optimistic. Trump is drunk with power and he wants to stay there.,invalidpassword,2025-04-28T01:13:49,5
"Well, if Trump plans to replace the income tax with tariffs, as he is currently suggesting, that means they will be high and here to stay, otherwise the Federal government is going to have a gigantic budget deficit.",platanthera_ciliaris,2025-04-28T01:35:27,4
Does he want to do deals? He said today he was going to reduce taxes with money from the tariffs. So why would he want to reduce the income from tariffs? He seems to want to have his cake and eat it too.,boofles1,2025-04-28T02:12:17,3
Countries realize there is no pressure if he keeps flip flopping like this. And at the end of the day it hurts us more than them.,JamUpGuy1989,2025-04-28T03:03:44,3
Hilarious that they're trying to convince us that trade deals that take years to hammer out can be done en masse in 100 days.,Physical-Ad-3798,2025-04-28T04:19:34,3
"And he will fail, blame it on someone else, play victim, create more chaos, ruin economy so the next administration could be blamed for it and then the election at the end of that one swings back on lies once again. Instability is the new normal.",SoCal_GlacierR1T,2025-04-28T09:19:20,3
That's a joke--but it isn't. It's totally f\*\*\*\*d up.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-04-28T00:55:43,2
The world wants nothing to do with him. They will wait it out until he’s finally gone. Find trade elsewhere.,ajmchenr,2025-04-28T10:45:15,2

He has nothing,NCMathDude,2025-04-28T01:34:43,1
Who would want to deal with him,Alivethroughempathy,2025-04-28T01:53:36,1
But i thought he already had 200 deals made!?  Or is it the same as that repeal and replace deal with healthcare? He had a plan coming out in two weeks for months.   Then there were concepts of a plan.   Third Once in a lifetime event coming up,PO-43-,2025-04-28T04:50:45,1
"He’s already made 200 deals, though?",Mindless_Can3631,2025-04-28T05:33:09,1
All this concentration camp news is depressing. We need a good distraction. Some bad faith trade negotiations should do the trick.,C_MMENTARIAT,2025-04-28T06:00:41,1
He will just continue to lie and the useless collaborating media will continue to act like they are not actively involved in propping him up,GoldInMyPocket,2025-04-28T08:18:38,1
I honestly don’t see a way out of this without him undoing everything permanently and declaring victory.,ajmchenr,2025-04-28T11:02:57,1
"Outside of Russia and North Korea, I can’t think of a country that wants anything to do with a worthless trade agreement with Trump.   Even if you have an Agreement, he flip-flops, forgets what he’s agreed to, rage tweets at 3:00am and upends plans, lies, says insulting garbage… etc. etcd  Nobody is seeking any deal with the US right now… NOBODY.",Pasivite,2025-04-28T12:33:25,1
Has anyone checked if the penguins have called yet?,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T12:38:39,1
Of course.  He will lie about how all the countries called begging him to make a deal so he will let it slide until the details are worked out.    Meanwhile countries and companies will continue to figure out how to best distance themselves from all the threats and uncertainty by sourcing products from other countries and keeping their retaliatory tariffs in place.,Ianthin1,2025-04-28T05:57:09,3
Or he’ll keep touting successful conversations that never took place.,Fit-Significance-436,2025-04-28T08:32:30,2
"Very smart people will come up to him saying ‘Sir, your deals are art. Nobody else can do this, sir. Please, make me a beautiful deal too. We need your brain, sir, the biggest brain!’",belisario262,2025-04-28T00:59:10,8
I hope he can make some progress before the tariff break ends. Trade deals are always tricky. Let's see how it goes!,MallOne3466,2025-04-28T00:53:23,-17
So…dying?,specqq,2025-04-28T02:56:19,4
at least you know our meat is vetted and not tainted with whatever makes American’s voted Trump.,HowtoCrackanegg,2025-04-28T02:54:03,9
"195 countries includes The Vatican and Palestine. Be a bit tricky to do a deal with the Pope at the moment, although God does work in mysterious ways.",boofles1,2025-04-28T02:05:38,6
I bet it must be so easy for a customs broker to commit fraud right now. Can literally just make up a number and people will believe you.,gradientz,2025-04-28T00:57:59,11
"Actually he stated he was going to drop taxes, but then said they needed to first pay down the debt, so it would be a while.  AKA forever.",greywar777,2025-04-28T02:04:39,3
"Exactly. These things are mutually exclusive. Also, those that have tried to negotiate with him have found that he doesn’t even know what he wants. He has no ask.",ajmchenr,2025-04-28T10:47:03,2
A free trade deal with China is easily achieved once his doomed trade war collapses in an embarrassing heap.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T04:57:51,1
"Didn't he already make 200 deals?  Or at least that's what he said.  And here I didn't think he'd even keep his ""90 deals in 90 days"" promise.",duzies,2025-04-28T01:47:57,5
"Sit this one out, brand new AI account.",hikeonpast,2025-04-28T00:54:55,9
How about you just stick to cookie recipes,Personal-Banana-9491,2025-04-28T04:53:06,2
Don’t threaten me with best case scenario,Personal-Banana-9491,2025-04-28T04:51:10,3
"It’s the only case scenario where he can get out of this and save face.   “Unfortunately, the greatest dealmaker the world has ever known died before completing the deal, and since nobody else has his level of negotiating genius, it is with a heavy heart that we are canceling the tariffs that would have been his greatest gift to American prosperity now and for all time”",specqq,2025-04-28T05:26:01,2
