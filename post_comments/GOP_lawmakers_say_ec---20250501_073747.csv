"For once, I'm grateful for Trump's energetic showmanship and Biden's ghastly weakness. Trump went to great pains to own this. He bragged about it. He really played it up as a part of his power moves. Biden looks like he's barely capable of getting out of a rocking chair. Trump has been a dynamo here while it's been hard to tell if Biden is alive at any given moment over the last few years. Good luck pinning these high-activity shifts on Biden.  It's going to be really funny watching them try to reverse course on a narrative they already sold very effectively while people are pissed. I know someone's going to have some smug/defeatist comment about how consequences are never real for Trump/Republicans. That works in the abstract. It doesn't work when people are going hungry and you overtly ran on cheap groceries while slamming your opponent for increasing household expenses. And your currently backfiring plan is what you've been energetically selling to everyone who can see.

"3 weeks.   I work in customer behavior analytics. Any major issue will be top of mind while that issue persists (such as government shutdown), but will be forgotten within 3 weeks once the issue has ended.  Example: A company I worked for had paid for NFL advertisement slots, back in 2017 when Trump was railing against the NFL and Kaepernick for kneeling during the anthem. Complaints from our customers spiked the most within the first few days of Trump’s comment demanding we pull our advertisements. After 1 week it was still high volume but noticeably less, after 3 weeks it was maybe 1/1000th the original volume. It was to the point where basically no one was complaining any more. Within 2 months, no new complaints. Note: we never pulled the advertising.   This is why Spez made that comment about the Reddit protest change that happened (last year I think). People got over it within a month.   I saw this pattern repeat often. Spike in complaints when the event happened, to basically dead after 3 weeks. The only time complaints lasted longer than 3 weeks was if the event persisted and continued to directly affect them. After that persistent event ended though, 3 weeks and back to normal. So, people WILL have issues during the recession. After a recession ends though, within a month they will be back to check the R box.",alienbringer,2025-05-01T08:36:40,2
