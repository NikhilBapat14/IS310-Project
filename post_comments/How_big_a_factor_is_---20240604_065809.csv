"The biggest issue is less the boomers themselves than the massive increase in life expectancy without any increase in retirement age. The Boomers as a cohort saw the life expectancy at birth raise from 64 in 1946 (65 was set as a retirement age when more than half of Americans were expected to die by 65) to 70 in 1964 (5 years of retirement) and we're up to 79 1/4 years at birth in 2024, and this will only rise with superior medicine and treatments.  Remember, life expectancy is an average - the standard deviation is 8 years, and the mode in 1950 was 77, where in 2015 it was 87. We've gone from \~12 years of retirement to \~22, a full additional decade of people voting and collecting from their 401ks and pensions in a top-heavy structure.  This is a never-before-seen problem in history because human population growth is often self-limiting through disease, maternal mortality, food, and medical issues. All of that is going away, but the result *appears* to be a economic-and-social pressure to not have children on the young (with US TFR dropping to 1.5 and nations across the globe's TFR dropping at the same time as world poverty declines precipitously), which will continue to whittle away the base of the population pyramid until the system chokes.",Clone95,2024-06-04T09:44:39,9
The Baby Boomer generation isn’t even a real thing. Why would those random people be a cohort? It’s a boogie man construct that allows bigotry towards the aging.,itsakon,2024-06-05T03:35:35,2

"Baby boomers brought a curse on our generation. They are the ones that rejected Christianity and celebrated divorce, sexual liberation, women putting on man pants and getting professional careers. Their backwards parenting gave rise to the single mother boom, the dog mum boom, the loneliness epidemic, the mental health epidemic, and the inflation crisis.",billmagog040,2024-06-08T05:21:19,1
"What you are displaying to me, with your question, is Counter Culture Ideology.  Some defining elements of Counter Culture Ideology:  * Tends to be Egotistical.  There were a lot of pride movements.  Black Power, Latino Power, Feminism, Gay Rights, and so on.  These groups don't necissarily get along.  They are self-interested. * Tends to towards Emotionally Impulsed Youth Movements.  At a car dealership, a car salesmen may have worked to impulse someone to buy something.  The Beatles were a Counter Cultural Youth Movement.  Greta Thunburg and David Hogg was the media attempting to create Counter Cultural Youth Movements. * A proclivity towards what is new and hip.  Rock and Roll was Counter Cultural.  Rock and Roll was mainstreamed, and Disco was the new Counter Culture.  There was a big conflict there in the 1970's.  Hip Hop and Rap was Counter Cultural.  We have conflicts between Old Rap and New Rap.  Why does there need to be conflicts between Baby Boomers and other generations?  In the US, Social Security and the Baby Boomers may be a big issue.  Is Generation Y or Generation Z set against their families where they are an independent voting block? They shouldn't be.  What makes life worth living?  The Baby Boomer Generation, in the US, was the last generation to be drafted.  In six months or so, given the draft was suddenly reinstated, there may be a reckoning of thought, and a readjustment, in people's minds, of what is important.  Given a family had an only male child, that male child would be exempt from being drafted given the old Draft Law.  Why?  That family may need a male child to carry on the family name.  Have you seen the movie ""Saving Private Ryan?""   The Ryan Family, in World War II, they had four sons who all volunteered.  Three of them died.  A squad was sent to retrieve, and send home, the last Ryan son.  Family is important.  People have not been taught to think like that around Academia anymore.  That may be ""Patriarchy.""  What you are showing me is Counter Cultural thinking or ideology.  I am Generation Y.  I don't need to be at odds with other generations.",ManonFire63,2024-06-04T08:10:20,-2
">The Boomers as a cohort saw the life expectancy at birth raise from 64 in 1946  >We've gone from ~12 years of retirement to ~22  Life expectancy at birth isn't the same thing as life expectancy at retirement.  In 1940, life expectancy at full retirement age was 13.5 years. Today, it is 17 years. So the length of retirement has increased, yes, but only by 3.5 years, not by anywhere nearly as much as you make it seem.",curien,2024-06-04T11:06:52,9
"> Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time someone is expected to live, ***based on the year of their birth,***  While it's true medical advantages mean that boomer life expectancy is not necessarily accurate 3/4s of a century later, the statistics as given in 2024 is for people _born today_.   It's also likely that it will continue to expand with medical innovation but it should be mentioned from 2020-2022 it was declining, in large part because of the pandemic, but science also suggests pandemics will become more likely as population centers continue to push against wild borders, and healthcare itself is heavily politicized. The U.S. spends much much more but doesn't have the same outcomes as other countries in the OCED. So thinking that life expectancy is a sure fire guarantee is not actually a given.",InitiatePenguin,2024-06-04T13:01:56,1
">Why would those random people be a cohort?   Shared interests, really. Obviously you can take issue with me then projecting that onto a generation. A vested interest that's often cited (here in the UK at least) is that the political class and the elderly that are more likely to vote tend to own property, and so have a vested interest in not seeing property prices go down.   As a (Millenial) homeowner I naturally share this vested interest, so of course these things don't solely correlate with your age. That being said, the point I wanted to discuss was whether the numerical advantage that Boomers have mean that the interests they come to accrue as they age can be more dominantly asserted.   The majority of Boomers own their own home (here at least) which means that, so long as they form the majority of people who're likely to vote/decide who's ruling the country/be in politics, housing reform is disincentivised.   That's just one example. People who share general life and material circumstances, as well as go through particular experiences/find themselves in a particular place at the same time, are going to be possible to identify as a collective.",BenedickCabbagepatch,2024-06-05T07:52:54,1
"Indeed.   Here in the UK housing is expensive partly *because* the government is interfering in the industry. We had a construction boom in the 1930s but, after WW2, the Labour government introduced stringent planning permission which requires all sorts of hoops to be jumped through and for any minority of local residents to torpedo construction projects by recording their reservations (classic NIMBY stuff).    This is why nothing gets built here and most of us live in houses that are 70+ years old.",BenedickCabbagepatch,2024-06-06T05:54:10,1
"What prompted me to write the question was the conclusion of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5aJ-57_YsQ) which reminded me of another I'd seen yonks ago about Baby Boomers specifically. It's not that I myself have particular animosity toward boomers (as with all things, life is complicated and there are no simple answers to issues; things are multifaceted), but I wanted to see what others thought of this kind of analysis of issues today.   Obviously I was coming at it from a bit of a UK-centric perspective; namely that (wealthy) boomers have been best insulated from a lot of the cost-of-living issues here, while simultaneously also being the most politically engaged democraphic. Couple that with their generation's size, and I can see why people might advance the argument I made.   I do think that, while it's valid for millenials, zoomers, etc. to articulate how their generation might have been ""shafted,"" it's obviously important to not then discard any sense of personal responsibility; you have to deal with the hand you're dealt, after all.   But it is the case that people, if they will own a house, will now own it later in life, mortgages are no longer tax-deductible expenses (at least here), young people are straddled with higher educational debts their parents and grandparents didn't pay, we've a heightening tax burden, pensioners are (for the first time in history) earning more money on average than young people are working, infrastructure and the (probably never sustainable, to be honest) health system are collapsing. I think there's plenty of fuel for resentment.",BenedickCabbagepatch,2024-06-04T09:03:22,3
"There doesn't need to be conflict between a boomer and gen z _interpersonally_ for the systemic results of their generation and policies enacted while they were alive.   But that doesn't mean _there aren't_ systemic consequences of actions and policies of the boomer generation, some of which were in their control.   Boomers aren't downsizing their homes because the economics and want to aren't there. Combined with the lowest rate of new construction and highest growth in population has produced an untenable situation.   Likewise, their homes are acting as investment vehicles and produces the self interest of NIMBYism — further developed by master plan communities that are designed not to change or be flexible via zoning laws.   OP is not asking to be at odds with other generations, but is asking for a fairly rational and reasonable and factual response to something that is often said by the the people you're talking about and want to know the truth of the matter.   And the truth of the matter is that there is lots of complex factors but there are real consequences from policies of prior generations including their inaction today to change the status quo.",InitiatePenguin,2024-06-04T13:07:35,3
"When you are talking about ""My Generation""....that is egotistical like The Who song.  Why are different generations separate, thinking as a generational group or body, instead of thinking as families, as communities, as a city, as a state?  I started watching your video.  I can't say that I am familiar with Britain enough to comment on all the issues brought up.  I can say that there will be, at some point, another depression.  The US, right now, is 34 Trillion in debt.  The US Credit Rating has gone down.  The current international system has been propped up by the US Navy.  We live in a world where fruit picked in Chile is canned in Thailand, and the jeans people wear, the parts may have been produced in five different countries.  Given the US Navy, for some reason, could not perform its function of keeping free trade open.......that is the end of the world as you and I have been aware of it.  A lot of countries have been deep in debt.  There are currently, in 2024, a lot of things changing politically where older definitions of ideology and party are shifting.  We are in a period of great change.",ManonFire63,2024-06-04T10:40:20,-2
"Look at what you are doing.  You are attacking and critiquing, being set against, another generation rather than looking forwards to defeat bad politics that have been keeping everyone enslaved.  You are looking behind and blaming dad or grandpa instead of looking forward.  Forward isn't being set against dad or grandpa.  Dad and grandpa help give a young man identity.  Where was someone receiving their identity from?  The Government?  Ideology?  There are solutions rather than pointing the finger and blaming past generations.  What you are showing me is some of the worst of Post-Modernism with your attitude, and your inability as any type of leader to find solutions.",ManonFire63,2024-06-05T03:13:15,0
">Why are different generations separate,  The same reason why we have labeled generations to begin with.

">Many of which can be broken down along different perspectives among generational lines....  (That ideology and party are shifting)       Not in the US.  I don't know about Britain at this time.  What you are showing me is that you are suffering from the sins of ""My Generational"" thinking, like The Who.  That type of thinking really started with the Baby Boomers.  Blaming the Baby Boomers and falling into their same trap, that is not going to do anything other than compound problems.  Are you being set up for a Marxist ""Cultural Revolution?""    In the US, things are a lot different, in terms of shifting ideology and party.  Barrack Obama made a coalition of Non-Americans, Foreign Intellectuals, and Liberal Elitist.  Biden continued it.  The Democrats used to represent blue collar America.  The Cold War is over, and things have changed, and people are starting to wake up to this change.",ManonFire63,2024-06-05T03:22:06,0
