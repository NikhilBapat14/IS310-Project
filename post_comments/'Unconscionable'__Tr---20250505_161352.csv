I've been to seven protests so far and 80% of the people at them are boomers. Maybe this will get a few young people out to protest.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T16:46:29,21

"Republicans will scream until they are blue in the face. Taxes back to the tax payers is socialism and communism. Tax money free and clear to the people who have everything is capitalism! Remember everyone who thinks Biden was in charge of the Covid lock downs. Cheeto started the PPP loan program. If anyone on the right can read what PPP stands for, paycheck protection program. If you can add 2+2 and get 4 then the next question should be easy enough. Why did we need the PPP loans (and also to write them off free and clear) when these corporations sent everyone to the unemployment line? Does that really make any sense to the tax payers? I guess it does if you think tax money back to the wealthy is what Americas directive should be. Republicans love to flaunt their “businessman” the orange clown. We are all witness to his leadership. He’s a fucking clown and everyone who worships him is in the same boat.",tacs97,2025-05-05T19:21:28,1

"And when Biden tried to forgive people’s student loan debts, Republicans in every branch of government worked tirelessly to prevent it from happening.  And then the electorate rewarded them by electing them to every branch of government and ensure they could do as much harm as possible.

That's what I was thinking. It's far easier to lien and seize assets than it is to go thru garnishing what little people may make (and some states severely limit the amount that can be taken anyways).,Smooth_Influence_488,2025-05-05T17:44:08,4

"To be fair, the amount of voter suppression meant that any other result was a long shot.  That's what should win awards, the mass voter suppression. It's the product of a deliberate effort going back decades. Because Trump didn't magically happen in a vacuum.

"It's because idiots in hicktown, USA hate their status in life, hate that they've been stuck in the same small town their entire life, and have insecurities about their own intellect. So they're easily manipulated by propaganda that makes them feel good.   ""It's a good thing you didn't go to college or make something of yourself. Colleges brainwash you. Turn you evil. Waste your money. The ones who are idiots are those that took out loans. They're tax payer elitist liberal moochers who waste all their money on lattes and iphones. Don't trust educated people.

I wasn't retired when I was going to civil rights and Vietnam War protests in the 60s and 70s.   I was working and being a student full time.     Also six of the seven Trump protests that I've been to were on weekends.    Most people have some free time - it's just a question of how you prioritize it compared to the other things you think are important.     In recent years we've had plenty of other protest movements such as Extinction Rebellion and the George Floyd protests where there were plenty of young people.   So I've been assuming that the reason why we don't have many young people at this is because young people must think Donald Trump is just fine.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T20:30:47,0

"Your response to voters being suppressed is to blame them for not showing up?   While apathy explains some of it, just blaming “Dem” voters for not showing up is ignoring the systematic attack on voting rights (from gerrymandering to voter roll purges) that got us here.",Melodic-Task,2025-05-05T19:28:26,7
"You're just making up excuses.    We brought our grandchildren to one of the protests and they had a great time!  Take your kids to the protest. I've seen other people bring their kids to these protests, too.   I'll be dead in a few years but it's their future that's at stake.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T20:35:13,0
"I’ve had a gun pulled on me at a protest so I can understand why many parents wouldn’t want to bring their kids. Why don’t you go lecture a single mom living paycheck to paycheck about how her priorities aren’t as important as protesting every weekend, I’m sure it would be well received.",Smooth_Weird_2081,2025-05-05T20:40:05,3
The vast majority of people are not single moms living paycheck to paycheck. The vast majority of people do have free time and they just choose to spend it doing things other than going to protests. Like I said you're just making excuses.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T20:46:16,0
"And you’re not acknowledging that some people have different circumstances than you have/had. The majority of people in general are working paycheck to paycheck compared to the 60s and 70s. If the weekends are reserved for protesting according to you, when do the people working 80-100 hours a week have time to grocery shop or do household chores? You can encourage people to protest but you don’t sound realistic about what kind of lives most Americans are living right now, clearly this last election showed we need to meet people where they are.",Smooth_Weird_2081,2025-05-05T20:54:14,2
As I said **most** people are not working 80 to 100 hours a week.    I'm not expecting people who are that stretched out have any time for political engagement but they represent only a small percentage of the population.      You're just making excuses. The vast majority of people do have free time. You may not but you are not representative of most people.   You're right that because I am a boomer I have more free time. I only spend a few hours a week protesting.  I spend a lot more hours at beaches and concerts and restaurants and sports events. Where I see lots and lots of younger people.     So that's empirical proof that there are a lot of young people with free time.   It's just a question of prioritizing.    So what are you doing to try to stop Donald trump? ,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T21:04:58,0

I know quite a few people who are living paycheck to paycheck. But they still have free time.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-06T10:52:53,2
"Right, but you’re moving the goalposts from your original point.  If you’re living paycheck to paycheck, and protests happen during your working hours, your hands are likely tied.  I do agree people can do more, and there’s things you can do besides protest. I’m providing additional context around people’s lack of action",crazyrich,2025-05-06T11:10:12,0
"You're still just making excuses. Most protests happen on weekends and most people don't work on weekends so if you can't go, you can't go.    But there are plenty of people who can.  As I said, the sports stadiums and concerts and restaurants and beaches and other entertainment venues are filled with young people on the weekends where I go. There's no shortage of young people to protest if they want to. But they don't.   You still haven't said what you're doing to resist Trump.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-06T11:16:01,0
