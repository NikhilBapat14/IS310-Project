"This is the dumb type of article which makes people think the left is unhinged and redpills the youth.  Protein and a nutritional source was popular way before MAGA, like hundreds of thousands of years before MAGA.  We evolved into being bipedal endurance hunters because we enjoy protein.

"Americans have been obsessed with protein since….   We can blame maga for a lot, but the global livestock industry is massive and is rooted in early parts of recorded history soooo maybe not this",pressedconscience,2025-05-01T23:27:17,1

"Essentialism and reductionism. If you're a MAN, then you're a pro-Trump MAGAt, who is a bearded, aggressive, muscular guy who watches UFC and Joe Rogan, who eats nothing but meat unlike them limp-wristed soyboys who do things like think, or care about people, and tolerate their womenfolk (if even that) talking back to them.   It's selling an image of what ought to be by appealing to some base instincts, and reinforcing them culturally. Protein is about pushing that sliver of an ideal of muscularity and the alpha-bro vibe. Then just throw out loudmouthed and opinionated influencers like Andrew Tate, the Liver King, Rogan/UFC, Logan Paul into the mix, and have them spout other MAGA-friendly positions as ideals.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T15:39:17,0

"Another funny thing is that while gym culture was apolitical for a while, I recall when I was a kid in the Obama era that caring about being fit  was a liberal thing and we made fun of fat people.  It was a much simpler time.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-01T15:32:53,2

I think this is more about the MAGA influencers pushing the carnivore diet… and dudes so close to the closet door that they think people will out them if they’re seen eating a vegetable.,d_c_d_,2025-05-01T15:43:09,4

"Eh. I feel like machoism comes from a ""masculinity is superiority"" and ""men are men"" mindset. Also going to add: there is such a thing as too much protein, most Americans get more than enough, and it really isn't a topic that gets discussed a lot - not in schools, media, most online fitness spaces. And I find that alone very telling.  I don't know, I think there's some credence to America's meat and protein obsession being some culturally ingrained way that is embedded in a lot of conservatism even if an individual subject to it isn't wholistically conservative. If you consider more the general mindset involved - it's not really science back (yes, protein helps build muscle, but there's a cutoff to it where it is no longer beneficial), it's a hyper focus on masculinity and over valuing it, people get extremely defensive about it and refuse to look at reducing or removing meat from their diet as a possible solution to things like the environment, animal cruelty, etc.. even when the benefits might outweigh the cons on paper.  I think it honestly does have a strong correlation with the way Americans are obsessed with individualism, ""strength"", closed off-ness to making changes that could be viewed as ""feminine"", ""girly"", ""lefty"", ""bleeding heart liberal"" and the readiness to dismiss those solutions as ""weak"", ""stupid"", ""feels over reals"" or whatever else.  I don't know, just look at the American ideals, just look at Americans, our culture - and see how a lot of MAGA-ism was able to flourish in the framework of our culture. I think it's willful denial to ignore any kind of connection to culture trends and their relationship to our politics.",Hi_Jynx,2025-05-01T16:05:03,1
"What I mean is like “being ripped bro!” was sort of apolitical.   But the act of caring about being fit, such as jogging and yoga and eating well, was viewed as liberal.   Republicans were associated with like “People of Walmart”, “The Biggest Loser” was usually in some podunk red state town…there was a whole little movement about how fat people were dumb and pathetic and made bad choices, which I think was a bit of projection because red states have a shit ton of obesity and everyone was pissed about the stock market and the stupid wars.  It was shitty but it’s much better than today. You can lose weight. You can’t become straight or white.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-01T15:38:19,3
">I feel like machoism comes from a ""masculinity is superiority"" and ""men are men"" mindset  Ill give you that. Machoism is closely aligned with patriarchal thinking.    > I think it's willful denial to ignore any kind of connection to culture trends and their relationship to our politics.  Im not denying anything. Im just an idiot asking questions to better my understanding of what you were getting at.",TacoDelMega,2025-05-01T16:29:47,2
"In the 70s-90s, ""eating well"" was a rejection of cultural norms: it meant vegetarianism, veganism, ""Mediterranean diet"", etc. These were perceived as effeminate. A lot of vegetarianism is health-driven, but a lot of it is also from a place of compassion.  Along with this, health food advocates were constantly trying to find new, exotic foods: kale, acai, quinoa. Meanwhile traditional foods were derided as bad for you -- butter, steak, eggs, burgers, etc. I remember a male-coded commercial showing a guy grilling at a tailgate, staring at a quinoa burger with a confused look on his face thinking ""what the heck is queen-oh"".  With the popularity Atkins/low-carb/keto, then paleo and carnivore, those very ""traditional"" foods gained a resurgence in healthy diets. Bacon was a health food now. (I'm not talking about the ideal low-carb diet, I'm talking about *perception* of them.)  Just look at Diet Coke (an 80s product with feminine-coded marketing) versus Coke Zero  (an 00s product with masculine-coded marketing).",curien,2025-05-01T15:53:05,6
"Sorry, I didn't mean you specifically. Just in general the way people are closed off to even having this nuanced discussions or ones of it's ilk. So more all over this thread or on the rare occasions this kind of subject even gets highlighted.  Honestly, I think people in general are very averse to ideas and notions they aren't used to.",Hi_Jynx,2025-05-01T16:32:35,2
"Thank you! Honestly, I think people's emotional refusal to even entertain the idea that there is a cultural association with meat=manly=good, plants=girly=bad is actually just a testament to the strong hold meat and those cultural ideals have on everybody.  News flash, plugging your fingers in your ears and going la la at all thoughts you don't like on initial reaction is the hallmark of conservatism - it speaks to a level of closed mindedness that is innate in conservatism!  Honestly, not even about whether this particular article or idea is correct, but everyone's readiness to make fun of it and not even ***consider*** the notion or inspect their own relationship with meat that ***could be***, not even necessarily is, a manifestation of perpetuating ingrained cultural ideals embedded in conservative ideals.  Sorry, but I think everyone's readiness to outright dismiss an idea because they don't like it speaks to a greater issue and perfectly exemplifies the petty closed mindedness that brought America to where it is and the meat of it is just a facet of it - not the cause.",Hi_Jynx,2025-05-01T16:16:13,4
