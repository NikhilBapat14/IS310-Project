While traveling for work and just catching glimpses of headlines in other countries and it‚Äôs clear: we are the laughing stock of the world under Trump.

"A bit from the piece:  >While the rest of the world views him as dangerous, it does not take him seriously. Trump has projected his fatuous fantasies about global domination onto the wall of world opinion ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs more like Plato‚Äôs cave or the light show announcing the opening of a mall in suburban Indianapolis is a matter of individual judgment ‚Äî while at the same time backing away from all forms of international engagement and obligation. The contradictions are embarrassing, abundant and obvious to everyone. As we supposedly measure these things, Trump is the most powerful individual in the world.

"People are just so reactionary like first of all the things that he's doing and that are happening are stuff that he said he would do and he's doing them   is he doing them with a lot of finesse? no but so what  Any one with the knowledge or nuanced understanding of any of these situations required to approach them with dexterity wouldn't do anything to disturb the status quo in the first place because they're politically invested in this stuff  Education is a disaster especially higher education complete and total waste of money in all areas. Education is important but the bureaucracy behind it is not making it better. Between Common Core, the way teachers are like disempowered from interacting with students, kind of parenting them, administrators being useless bureaucrats with humongous salaries for no reason, and then in higher education research on b******* topics, an avalanche of ascientific papers (we are STILL writing papers on string theory, tons and tons of papers on dark matter when none of them matter because at this point either detect that s*** or get out, etc) all the money that goes into things that literally cannot lead to someone getting a job other than in Dei offices, which even if we were still doing that there just are not enough job openings there and they're generally well-paid ( there's nothing wrong with learning about those types of topics but they shouldn't be publicly funded because the research is not research it's just opinion pieces sometimes written with an error of statistical rigor but by people who have no fundamental understanding of Statistics at all), etc.   Anyone who is smart enough to know which things to defund and how to restructure higher education and how to restructure the Department of Education in order to make them effective and efficient and useful to people is going to be too invested in the groups that would be negatively impacted by changes and so they would never implement changes because it would be political suicide. Trump has the luxury of not caring about that stuff.    So needed to happen this wasn't the best way but it needed to happen so who cares. And if you're thinking ""I care"" just remember that these institutions and strategies and policies were completely failing like increasingly worse.   Dei is demonstrably not effective. I'm going to guess that if there was like a relationship someone tried to draw between racial and gender animosity over time and the amount of money dumped into Dei it would be not the relationship that proponents would hope for. These departments are useless. They cause more problems than they solve it's just a bunch of moralizing busy bodies with God complexes and it's stupid.   Ukraine is a b******* situation as well. No one's ever going to put troops on the ground which is the only way they potentially win but they don't want to trigger World War 3. Without troops it's a losing battle like it could take longer if you give them more money but they will lose and Vlad has all the time and the money and the Manpower in the world. People are already talking about a demographic crisis in Ukraine like they just are not going to win ever so why are we throwing money at it when North Korea is really wanting to be a problem for everyone and China could still kind of be an issue at least briefly... I think it would take you know several hours probably to wipe out their military but it would cost several hundred billion dollars  And it quite simply is not the US's problem like why were we the ones funding it I don't get it. People need to be realistic and come to terms with the fact that even if morally it's wrong for Russia to basically Annex Ukraine they just are going to because nobody's going to do anything about it because it's not worth it. The type of war that would be fought between Russia and Europe is very different than the one that they're fighting against Ukraine Ukraine is an invasion if Russia was fighting NATO the weapons they would be choosing would be completely different way more destructive it's just going to be like a missile slugfest. Ukraine's not a buffer in that scenario.  The tariffs also I mean the rollout was comedically bad like really really bad but it was ultimately because China was already in a deflation spiral, xi xinping, after spending decades consolidating power is kind of losing his control over everything because of their economic situation, and the US is a huge huge huge percentage of their exports. So this is basically a way to put a foot on his neck, possibly suffocate the CCP of existence (it will still exist it will just not look anything, should xi be removed), and lowers the chances that Taiwan will be shelled. Because xi has propaganda as his population into thinking that China is like extremely prestigious in the world and it is getting his own citizens into trouble but definitely the illusion would be shattered if their entire Navy was obliterated and their economy sucks like he can't play victim in that case he just has to eat it  And illegal immigration and the perception that if you just get into the US eventually you'll be given amnesty (because it's basically true) is also something that kind of had to be dealt with and this is the definitely the worst way to do it but it was again the only way it was going to happen  And obviously the weird liberal defense of MS-13 was really disgusting and funny and like eventually they realized it was in defensible so they stopped talking about it but that's like one of the other reasons to just start deporting everyone because you just can't control something like that if you're just going to let everybody in.   I didn't vote for him, although he seems to overlap at least partially with the things that I think needed to be done. Again the implementation is not good and I don't like listen to anything that he says and I didn't watch The Campaign so I don't know like what the whole motivation is of doing it this way I'm guessing it's just ignorance but it was the only way it was going to happen it was this or nothing. they are like Necessary Things they were never going to be done by someone with the political Acumen and intelligence to do it right",Velereon_,2025-04-27T10:18:41,-14
"We won't. The USA is going to collapse like the USSR did.   You can't have a Nation divided against itself. Countries and Nations and Governments aren't real things, they are ideas and beliefs. They are agreements.  The USA had its problems but after WW2 regardless of the differences we all agreed that we were Americans. That we would hang together or surely hang apart.   But various interests swarmed in after the Fairness Doctrine was revoked, and huge fortunes were given over to create the propaganda that held Party over Country, and sold the idea that not only did we not need to stick together, that in fact anyone not in your Party was not an American, they sold the image that the USA was best served by being divided against itself.  They painted a picture of how simple it could all be if, instead of debating and cooperating, what if we instead chose dehumanizing, and the use of force?   Now the ideas and the beliefs have all changed, and there is no room to even consider agreements.

Montana, the Dakotas, and the like would seem poised to be aligned, but the economies there likely leave a lot to be desired. Maybe states like Michigan or Minnesota join Canada. There are so many unlikely scenarios that could happen, but there's the slightest thread of logic behind each one.  It took about 70 years to go from formation to collapse of the USSR.

"*We survived the Civil War that literally cut us in half*  Interesting that you consider that to be an example of why we'll be okay.  You know that practically every male person between the ages of 13 and 70 in the South DIED in that conflict, right? You know the South with a few regional exceptions was literally BURNED TO THE GROUND.   That the entire Confederate Army that surrendered numbered less than 28,000 men, when close to 300,000 had been killed on the Confederate side, and more men than that on the side of the North but the North had roughly triple the population of free people PRIOR the conflict.  It's why every podunk good ol' boy in the South with their stupid ""my ancestors fought in the war!"" BS is just that.   Not unless they had a child BEFORE the war, because afterwards basically all the men were DEAD.   **Not trying to argue that ending slavery was not a justifiable reason to do that**, okay, but it was hardly *no big deal.*   If that that's your metric of things that are survivable, I would not hold that particular conflict up as one where we worked through it.   If you've ever watched ""Gone With The Wind"" which is a ridiculously romanticized and fairly gross depiction of one spoiled rich girl before, during and after the War, still it depicts her as a heroine because she learns to do things like (checks notes) desperately eat rotten food she's grubbed around in the ruins for and declares AS GOD IS MY WITNESS I WILL NEVER GO HUNGRY AGAIN.  Scarlet O'Hara is a fictional character but nearly everyone she knew dying, entire cities burning, and mass starvation were NOT fictional.  If we're going to have to go through something like that again I personally WOULD call that conflict an example more of collapse than otherwise.  Weirdly I feel like the deep South in general and SC/NC/GA in particular are indeed a weird mix of ideologies, and frankly to go out the door around here shit is pretty chill. I don't think we'll be fighting our neighbors and I don't think that people here are interested in getting conscripted into a MAGA army to root out ""the Homegrowns"" as someone in the White House likes to call people like me.

Nobody around here lionizes Dylan Roof or holds up his disgusting attack as anything except what it was. People will spit on the ground and refuse to mention his name.  There's worse places you could be when the food runs out.  Which is what I am concerned will happen when the rest of the world is tired of our bullshit and dumps the USD as the world reserve currency, effectively making our dollar worth close to zero overnight.

"*\*shrugs*  My comment was made in the context of what the world is thinking about the USA/our relationship to the rest of the world, and our chances of ""recovery"" which will be heavily influenced by that.  We haven't yet started to really feel the damage this ""Administration"" has already done, nor the damage it will continue to do.  My pretty-much-mind-made-up bet as to the point is that where the REAL fun starts will be when the rest of the world rug pulls the use of the USD as the world reserve currency.  After all, its value for that purpose over the last roughly 80 years has been our *stability*.   It's the Secret Sauce that has made the USA such an economic power house.    You replace the USD with a basket of BRICS currencies and/or the Euro, then combine that with everything that's already happening, you have a pretty solid recipe for a level of economic disaster that could make the Great Depression look like a child's birthday party.   I don't want or wish for terrible things to happen. I'm not selling doom.   But I have been watching the USA truly devolve into a fascist Police State for my entire adult life, starting with Reagan, continued under every single  Administration since then, REALLY ramped up post 9/11, then yet again to even more next level shit post J6th. And now we have **this**.      We now have clearly demonstrated that our ""stability"" is a joke, that we are entirely at the mercy of the whims of whoever has the most money, we have a literal Clown Car Administration and there's no one at the wheel that is steering this situation ANYWHERE except off a cliff.  So the rest of the world should do business with us why? They should continue to listen to us and deal with us why? We are prepared to pull together and face an unprecedented economic disaster that's an entirely self-inflicted wound how?  I mean China is doing pretty great for themselves these days but between 1958 to 1962 so *four years* an unknown number but roughly 30 million people **starved to death.**   We've survived worse **so far.**   Truly, I do hope I'm catastrophizing.

Your civil war numbers are correct but I suspect the people with whom you speak are either referencing indirect ancestors, or their ancestors were deserters, as all of my direct Southern ancestors were. Tons of men from that side deserted the war, usually because the conditions were so miserable and/or they worried their families were starving.   The reason that Scarlett‚Äîwho is a complex character in some ways‚Äîis hailed as a heroic figure (and I‚Äôm not necessarily saying I agree with that) isn‚Äôt because she ate rotten food but because of the actions she took after that to save herself and her family from starvation and financial ruin (mainly because she wanted to save the home in which she grew up). These actions included shooting a soldier who came into the house to loot it, being inventive when devising a plan to get money to pay the real estate tax bill, putting aside her disgust to marry a man who could financially help her family, and being such a successful businesswoman in that era that she becomes well-off again and is able to support her entire family.

"My personal opinion of Trump: I am an American who has been aware of this man since the 1980s.  Donnie was featured on a show in the states called 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' where they toured his home.  Everything was pseudo-opulent; I remember him even having a gold-plated toilet.   I was young when I saw this interview, but that day I finally understood the meaning of the term posh twat.  His first wife, Ivana,  was from Czechoslovakia.  While her native country  was not formally a part of the Soviet Union, it was a satellite state of the USSR. Trump was probably introduced to Russia via his wife, and he found the oligarch lifestyle over there most attractive.  I believe becoming a Russian oligarch was one of the goals in his life.  Everything he does is laced with one-upmanship. When you combine that with sociopathy and dementia, you have a perfect storm of failure, depraved indifference and disarray.  I recommend reading 'Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man' written by his niece Mary L. Trump who a doctorate in clinical psychology.

"Ah, but that assumes these people would GO on that vacation. It's not necessarily a lack of funds - though that's a hurdle. It's a lack of intellectual curiosity and an outright fear of things outside their bubble.   Rural(ish) Americans are a fascinating study in base human emotions and instincts. They are no different than similar rural populations in other countries. But our space and low population density allows these communities to exist without exposure to people not like them. Meanwhile, the cities around them are heavily multicultural, in a country that doesnt require or expect assimilation.   Imagine leaving your 6,000 person rural town  - where not only is everyone white, but they all look alike from inbreeding - and driving a few hours to the nearest city for some appointment. In the city, you see signs and business names in 20 different languages.  Everyone else in the city looks perfectly comfortable in this environment, finding a way to communicate with one another despite accents you can't understand and words you've never heard. But YOU can't. You don't have the practice. You feel lost and left behind in *your own state*. It's disconcerting and scary and embarrassing. So as quickly as you can you escape back to what you know.  You're now reluctant to even go 3 hours to your nearest city if you don't absolutely HAVE to.
