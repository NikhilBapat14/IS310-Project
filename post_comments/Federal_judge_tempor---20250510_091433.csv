"It does not take a majority to prevail ... but rather an irate, tireless minority, keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of men.  - Samuel Adams",OkShow3496,2025-05-10T09:44:57,133
"President’s Executive Order 14210, that is the main reorganization of the executive branch that is demolishing agencies.   https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.448664/gov.uscourts.cand.448664.85.0.pdf  Conclusion  > The Court concludes where it began. The President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch. Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation— as he did in his prior term of office. Indeed, the Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime.  Also  The President’s Reorganization Authority  > The President may be able to accomplish some reorganization goals through particular statutory delegations of authority, executive orders, department memos, management policies, and other devices, but to accomplish major reorganization objectives, he will need explicit statutory authority from Congress, a viable procedure to enact reorganization plans, and a feasible implementation strategy. As for the details of any reorganization plan, exact limits on the President’s authority to reorganize the executive branch “can properly be analyzed only in light of the particular changes which are proposed” and the relevant constitutional provisions and statutory authority.

Another District level judge. This temporary halt is temporary. District Court judges are like middle school hall monitors these days. Everything ends up with SCOTUS. And even then DOJ is under the Executive Branch so... no enforcement.,williamgman,2025-05-10T09:33:26,56

"World record pace for a court to rule on something that a 7th grader could tell you is flat illegal. The Constitution made it pretty damn clear which branches had which powers, and it's been obvious for months now the President is running roughshod over Congress's territory.  It's also been really fucking clear that Congress doesn't even want to *attempt* to do anything, because it's going to be met with infinite filibusters, and resistance even from the Republican ranks who have been told to get in line or ""bad things will happen to them.""  I'm sure this Supreme Court will be happy to vote 6/3 to give the President full control over the Federal government though, given the way they were so enthusiastic to give him immunity for all of the illegal acts he's doing right out in the open with his Crypto for Access scheme and the firing of anyone who might stop it, so I'm not sure this is going to be much of a roadblock for long... but, alas. That's how countries like ours fall to fascism.",hackingdreams,2025-05-10T16:33:42,1

"They don't have to, because that's not how the US fed court system works. If the District Court is appealed the, the decision goes to an Appeals court.   Whatever the appeals court does, one or more parties can *petition* the SCOTUS to hear their appeal. The SCOTUS can simply deny cert when the Regime's appeal hits their docket. Once that happens, the district court's decision is now the law.   The Regime will probably ignore it at that point, but the SCOTUS's bandwidth isn't a bottleneck because they ignore petitions where they feel the appeals court got it right.",bobartig,2025-05-10T12:35:41,1
"The title says, 'halts.'  But should say, ""mildly suggests.   ... Maybe.""",GagOnMacaque,2025-05-10T17:50:34,1
"You are making my point for me. The appeals court is a filter between the district counts and the USSC. The result is the same: far too many cases are in process for the SC to possibly adjudicate them all. Either the cases' original result or the result at the appeals level will be the end of most of these cases, as you said.   The SC will likely (if they're doing their job) accept cases that let them make whatever points they're trying to make. They'll deny cert when they think appeals made their point with sufficient clarity. They'll have to let a lot of things slide due practical considerations, but what they ignore will speak as loudly as the decisions they render.  And the question remains: what will be the central points the SC is trying to make?   So far all that's clear is they aren't in favor of midnight mass deportations without due process. That felt like a big one, but time will tell.",473713,2025-05-10T13:50:49,1
"The Appellate can issue a temporary stay against the District ruling until if and when SCOTUS hears it. Bottom line it can and will be delayed allowing MORE exporting to foreign prisons without due process. ""Delay delay delay... This is the Trump way"".",williamgman,2025-05-10T16:00:58,1
I agree with that part. They're using fifty different stalling techniques and inventing new ones every day. They're also finding ways to make everything more costly for their opponents.,473713,2025-05-10T16:27:25,1
