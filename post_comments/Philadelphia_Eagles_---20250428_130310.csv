"As a Clemson fan, Hurts was always a non-Clemson player I always respected. I‚Äôm not gonna be a revisionist regarding when he was drafted to my team, as I‚Äôll admit I was against it, but in hindsight it was obviously the right move. I remember the same season that Jalen and Tua were battling the starting job, ultimately Tua getting it, the same was happening at Clemson. Trevor Lawrence was given the starting job over Kelly Bryant (obviously a great move but I‚Äôll be gracious not to remind an Alabama fan why). The difference between the way Jalen handled it and Kelly Bryant handled it was night and day. KB immediately quit the team, and I still remember the very next game T-Law getting hurt. We had to go with our 3rd string since Kelly quit, who ultimately won the game. On the other hand, Jalen took it in stride, and while he did eventually transfer as he had every right to do, he did it AFTER the season, and came in to help the Tide win the SEC title game later that season when Tua went down in that game.
