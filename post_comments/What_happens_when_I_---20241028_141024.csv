"For NY specifically, what you're doing when you do that is participating in the state's ""fusion voting"" system. It does not contribute to their funding, but it demonstrates that you want to vote for a party that more aligns with your beliefs/values without ""throwing your vote"" out.  Also,the other commenter who said that the Working Families Party is only in NY is flatly wrong, they have chapters in 15 states and are growing.  The WFP funding and growth strategy doesn't revolve around the 5% threshold that you're referring to, but voting for them is a good idea if you care about pushing the Dems left but also don't like the idea of throwing your vote away.",NJdevil202,2024-10-28T16:10:34,12

The 5% threshold is there National vote total the Working Families party doesn't exist outside of New York State as New York state is one of the only States left that practices cross endorsements  What's far more important for your vote Is not the five percent threshold for federal funding But because ballot access to New York State is determined by what party's got a certain number of votes in the most recent presidential or gubernatorial election,LordJesterTheFree,2024-10-28T15:17:47,2
> voting for them is a good idea if you care about pushing the Dems left but also don't like the idea of throwing your vote away.  I'm ok with Democrats existing as left leaning central if there's another left party. I see what you're saying though.,rainshowers_5_peace,2024-10-28T16:28:39,1
"Locally and Statewide I always do.  Nader takes too much heat. Loads of dems in Florida didn't vote Gore, loads of voters shrug at the EC. No one seems to care that a candidates brother was screwball about allowing votes to go through. Nader wasn't the problem there!!",rainshowers_5_peace,2024-10-29T07:51:22,1
"Democrats have much fewer children than Republicans. With the immigrant population voting mostly Democrat, at least in the first generation, I don’t see either party getting the kind of control you are talking about.  I apologize, I am having trouble copying my link. But my source says 100 conservative adults will raise 208 children vs 147 children for liberal adults.",Hazel1928,2024-10-29T18:08:14,1
"But isn’t Alaska the only state to have implemented rank choice voting? Very Republican state…..    I’ve never voted for a Republican in my life, but just saying. I also suppose that Republicans might be very against this NOW because Sarah Palin [lost an election](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/gop-should-embrace-ranked-choice-voting-palin-alaska-loss-rcna46528) and the GOP seems to be blaming the rank choice voting for it. But I haven’t heard of any blue states even trying this system.",CremePsychological77,2024-10-29T23:30:17,1
>the Working Families party doesn't exist outside of New York State  The WFP has chapters in 15 states. Two of Philadelphia's city council members are elected as Working Families Party members (they defeated Republicans for the minority-party reserved seats last year).  The Working Families Party has more elected members currently than the Greens or Libertarians,NJdevil202,2024-10-28T16:11:54,3
"Hmm, I guess I’ll have to reach out to the two WFP members I voted for and got elected to the Philly city council to let them know their party doesn’t exist here…",NotABurner6942069,2024-10-29T05:50:51,1
