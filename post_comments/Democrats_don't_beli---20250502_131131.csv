"Republicans swallow lies like August Gloop at the Wonka factory. How do you respond to that; persuade people with ideas that are better than lies? So you either start lying and using their games too, or you try to change peoples minds so they aren’t so desperate to keep deep throating fascist lies. Don’t see any other options.",Static-Stair-58,2025-05-02T13:17:38,20

Well that’s what you have to do when you’re dealing with a destructive social movement whose defining feature is hatred of logic and reason.  Thank god we gave up on persuading Hitler.,The_Fugue_The,2025-05-02T15:07:00,4

"I think human stories tend to get through. I think Dems should start gathering personal stories of people affected in ways large and small.   A mom-and-pop shop is now facing bankruptcy. A scientist who wants to cure cancer had their research grant pulled. A long-time Fed employee was unceremoniously fired by Doge and is at an age when it’s difficult to find a new job, but T’s policies made retirement out of reach. A family is forced to choose between medical care and food.  It’s fine to feature people having to pare back on wants and nice-to-haves that were accessible even a month ago. That European vacation you saved up all year for? Now more expensive. You work long and hard at a low-wage job, and now suddenly can’t afford to treat yourself with temu? Sucks.   I’m sure there are millions of Americans who newly found themselves in such a situation.   One possible message: The most galling part? Your hardships, the reduction in your standard of living, your new fears about the future? All completely avoidable. Your life was derailed on April 5, all due to a singular, disastrous act of hubris and incompetence carried out by the sitting president, who couldn’t give an eff about you. There was no planning. No consideration for the fallout. No lifeline for people like you. He also doesn’t want to hear from you. He doesn’t welcome anything but good news and praises.   Also, just when people are feeling uneasy about their financial situation, keep juxtaposing that with the billionaires currying favors with the Orange Mob Boss by lining his pockets. While your 401k plummets, Mob Boss is making a killing from his crypto schemes. While you’re struggling, Mob Boss cut the social safety net so he could spend it on his vain military-themed birthday parade. Keep emphasizing the corruption and the double standards. Resentment and fear are a potent combination, as evidenced by Fox News. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-02T14:29:43,2
Oh is this the one who just voted for another Trump Appointee? I trust her for *sure*.,Clownsinmypantz,2025-05-02T13:33:46,2
"**From Zeeshan Aleem, writer and editor for MSNBC Daily:**      Democrats have quasi-surrendered to Trump in part because many believe Trump has a finger on the pulse of the body politic on issues such as immigration and believe that their pushing back will backfire. But there’s also an absence of faith that the party can embark upon persuading the public to see things in a way that isn’t defined by the right or isn’t a reversion to a pre-Trumpian status quo. Slotkin’s preference for “kings” is a poignant example because, while she’s obviously right that the word is more recognizable, she’s taking a position against pursuing a positive new identity and theory of class antagonism that “oligarchy” portends.      If there ever was a time for Democrats to experiment with new ideas to adapt to our populist era, now’s that time. Trump won the popular vote and increased his share of support in over 90% of counties across the U.S., compared to 2020, and the Democratic Party is experiencing record-breaking levels of unpopularity. Democrats also have significant room to experiment with messaging and policy as a minority party — the next set of elections are still 18 months away. What is there to lose?

"I don’t think Slotkin is saying we shouldn’t call out billionaires. She’s just saying the term isn’t understandable to most voters, which is probably more or less true. I also disagree that Dems are giving up on immigration and ceding the whole topic to Trump. Pretty much every Dem has rallied around the Abrego Garcia case. People really want to bash on the Dems but I think they’re doing what they can and that it’s voters who continue to be to blame. They refuse to care about the tariffs and insane deportations enough that Trump and Republicans in Congress are forced to back off.",StormOk7544,2025-05-02T13:30:02,1
"I agree with Slotkin that the average American voter has no idea what oligarchy means.   It's a four syllable word and the average American is just not very bright.   If I was trying to communicate with the average American voter I would use one and two syllable words, hand puppets, and smile a lot.   Every so often I would check to see if they understand what I said, and if they did I would throw them a little treat.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T13:29:04,1

"Again so many people in this thread clearly have not read the article. They're thinking this is about Democrats persuading Republicans which is literally the opposite point in the article. It ironically proves Slotkin's point over the article writer's point. Her point is that most people are too stupid to self-educate on what a term like Oligarchy means and instead we should use simple to understand terms like Kings. The writer argues that this is stupid and reductive and ruins the class-conscious idea behind Bernie's movement and that this is the Democrats' problem, they don't trust their voters to learn and instead feel a need to pander to whatever gets play in internal polling.  In response to this article being posted to Reddit most people don't read it, think the point is about bipartisanship and attack in every direction without logic because they're not actually responding to anything real. They refuse to self-educate and basically demand everything be as simple as possible because they just want to have someone direct their existing feelings rather than change them. Proving the article itself wrong. It's such a fun bit of irony.",DisMFer,2025-05-02T15:48:29,0
I’ve found that I could successfully convince people we need to do certain things and not do things the Republicans are doing.  I’ve had zero success convincing them the Democrats should do those things.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T13:27:49,8

"My observation is that there are too many people invested in the vindication of their virtues than there are people introspectively considering if their self-defined virtues are even virtuous. It's a downward spiral of negative thought, where the desire to appear 'right' completely overrides actually wanting to be right.",Lord0fHats,2025-05-02T13:40:55,4
"I was talking to my parents earlier this week, they’re deeply entrenched into mainstream democrat media; and yes, they mainly just parrot democratic talking points and don’t care about something until the dems say it’s time (ie. Gaza). My mom literally advocated for appeasement. I was blown away, and she was pushed back when I told her that appeasement has never worked, would gain the people nothing, and only embolden presi.

"Only 56% of Dems correctly identified the definition of the term, and while I’m actually surprised that close to 70% of independents got it right, 30% is still a big chunk. It might be okay to use the term though. Whether or not the term oligarchy is used probably doesn’t make or break anything. A bigger issue would be if Slotkin didn’t think billionaires were an issue at all, but that’s not what’s happening here. ",StormOk7544,2025-05-02T15:10:23,-1
"Those recognition numbers are horrible. It's 54% among the party, which is horrible. If anything that is solid evidence better language should be used that would have broader appeal.  Edit: rewording for clarity",cubert73,2025-05-02T15:18:44,-1
"Yes I did read the article and the poll questions were a web survey.    Right after college I worked for  a real public opinion polling company so I know something about how to put together a proper public opinion survey.   We had both commercial and political customers.     Doing it properly is expensive and difficult in order to avoid selection biases, and we typically spent at least a half an hour talking to each person that we polled - some in person some by telephone. This was in the late 1970s. We would often ask the same question multiple ways and we spent a lot of time qualifying the respondents. We picked them; they didn't pick us.   Doing reliable surveys these days is almost impossible.  Web surveys are inherently self-selective and therefore not to be trusted as good data.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T17:05:00,-1

"Crowds don’t mean a ton. Harris had some pretty good ones and Trump had some flaccid ones, and we know how that turned out. What Bernie and AOC are doing is fine and might end up being helpful, but that kind of remains to be seen and messaging can always be fine tuned. I don’t think Slotkin is going after Bernie. The article says she mostly agrees with him and only disagrees on how to best label the phenomenon of billionaires controlling politics.",StormOk7544,2025-05-02T17:57:59,-1

"How many average Americans have you met? In my 72 years I've met a lot of Americans because I live here.       I'm basing my argument on the fact that American voters are abysmally stupid - science, history, economics, and yes, vocabulary.  Four syllable words probably cut off half the population, and I'm basing this on Massachusetts where people are probably smarter than in places like Mississippi and Alabama.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T17:13:01,0
