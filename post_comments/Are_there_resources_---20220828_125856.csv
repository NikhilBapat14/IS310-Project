"The perhaps too obvious suggestions I have are to just call each state's election administration agency/secretary of state and ask what their procedures are, or if they have any referrals, or try and find actual poll workers and talk to them.  (I assume you are potentially politically active so your own state party probably has folks who do stuff for this.)  I also imagine each state theoretically has these procedures written in an election law statute somewhere, so check the state legislature pages for state laws.  If you have money to invest, you could theoretically also contact election law lawyers in each state and ask them for a summary, too (which I admit may be beyond the resources of your project).",digbyforever,2022-08-29T03:15:16,2
"Why do you want to create a website for this, to what end?",cincyblog,2022-08-29T06:18:28,1
"Kinda sorta, but I’d recommend including petitioning and ballot access rules as well, because in many states it’s a little-understood but key part of how party bosses keep their members toeing the line.",knockatize,2022-08-29T06:56:02,1
"I'm not sure how useful this really is. The process to count and record votes isn't all that different between states. I mean, does the distance a given state allows for poll checkers really make that much of an impact? Pretty much the process is the same throughout.  Where you have differences is in voting method, and that stuff is fairly well chronicled already.",mormagils,2022-08-29T09:06:41,1
"Yep, I'll be pulling information I need from every state's election website to get what I can regarding counting and security measures.  I was hoping for a more concise or singular source to pull most of my information. Once I get some structure and consistency, I plan on contacting the state's election officials for any specific questions.  No money in this project but that is another good avenue that I hadn't considered.  Thanks!",glov0044,2022-08-29T12:43:18,1
"I'd like to provide more information on a state-by-state basis on how the ballots are counted and secured so that people can gain some familiarity on the process and give people an idea on how hard it would be to fraudulent win an election. So when the next election comes around, I can speak more confidently that Georgia's voting machines would be a poor vector to vote switch because the voter would receive a paper ballot that would also have to switched. The implication being either tens of thousands of voters who may already be suspecting voter fraud decided not to look at their paper ballots before submitting or a massive machination involving republicans and democrats would have to occur to ensure the paper recount lined up with the official count.  The goal for this section of the website is to reinforce the idea that our elections are secure, voter fraud is rare, and that tens of thousands of American volunteers from both parties take part in making this process work.",glov0044,2022-08-29T13:08:44,1
"I'm not as much interested in the difference between states so much as clearly describing who and what is involved at each step for each state.  So many people (myself included) don't know what happens specifically once a ballot is cast that I believe it has made us susceptible to misinformation.  My example would be the allegations that Georgia's electronic ballots were ""hacked"" in 2020. I'd like for information to readily available that highlight how unlikely some of these allegation are. Things like the electronic machines print out a paper ballot that voters can check before submitting, creating 2 copies of the vote. This measure makes any ""hack"" attempt far more complicated in subverting an election.   For the Michigan example, I'm not concerned as much about the distance issue so much as how many Republicans, Democrats, and other parties are already doing the watching.  Documenting every step that requires all parties to be involved.  The core message being that in order for a massive electoral failure to have occurred, a massive amount of people from both parties would have to be complicit in whatever is going on.",glov0044,2022-08-29T12:59:41,1
"Oh, I see. Yeah, that stuff is pretty complicated, but mostly because it's far, far, far less interesting than you might think. I did a stint as a Field Organizer for a political campaign once, and trust me, it's way less dramatic than you suspect.  For the most part, the process is pretty standard. You have poll workers whose job is to make sure people are properly accounted for when voting. Most people use a voting machine, which is basically just a glorified adding machine. When it's done, they add it all up in a given location, call those numbers up the chain, and the process repeats, at which point the determine a winner.  Where most of the variation is really is in if a state uses paper ballots or not. Partly as a reaction to accusations in 2016, pretty much every state that uses an electronic machine nowadays uses that has a paper copy of some sort. In my state, NY, you get a paper folder that you mark and then re-enter that in an electronic machine, and then you give in the paper folder that serves as your hard copy. Other states, like CT, used a machine that would print out a ""receipt"" when you voted that would then be handed to the poll worker. For the most part, every state now does this in some form.  They actually do stay behind at the polling location and count by hand to make sure it matches up with the electronic results. The hand-counted total is reported. In cases where the vote is VERY close, there will often be extra rounds of this, or even the smallest discrepancies will be double and triple checked, but for the most part, races aren't usually that close.  Like...there's just not that much to really record here that is worth reading. They get the votes and count them. Period. The way to know if any accusations of ""hacking"" or fraud are credible is to ask the community of voting experts if they are...and they pretty much all agree that they aren't. If you want to get to know the really intimate details of how people count things...then be a poll worker in the next election cycle.",mormagils,2022-08-29T13:42:17,1
"I know that the details will probably be a bit boring.  That's fine and it will be up to me to design something that highlights the important points with the overall message is that the process is working.  Its more about gaining a familiarity with the process, and having other people getting more familiarity with the process. A lot of misinformation seems to be reliant on not understanding how things work, not understanding details.  I'd like to create a system that can quickly counter this misinformation.  This won't convince the committed, but if this information can be quickly attached by people on to wherever social media misinformation shows up, like an antibody to a virus, maybe it'd be easier to contain and isolate its spread.",glov0044,2022-08-29T15:05:40,1
"I mean, I'm not really sure what there is to say. They count the votes. ""Hacking"" machines doesn't make sense because there are like a dozen machines at every voting location, and there are hundreds if not thousands of voting locations, and so even if one person could ""hack"" one machine then it literally wouldn't make a difference.  Put another way, when in the history of anything has ""It was hacked, bro!"" with no further details *ever* been real? Like, there's a level of reasonableness we can apply to the situation that's much more effective than just learning more about a specific counting process.  What you really want to learn better is the theory behind voter fraud prevention. THAT is much more interesting. Why are poll workers effective? Why is registration effective? How many voting machines are used? What would a potential vulnerability look like? How do we know those things aren't a concern? That stuff we can go into more detail about (I have done so myself on this sub and others, if you want to dig through my many comments you should be able to find some).  Essentially you're asking the wrong question. The counting process isn't really notable in any way. It's not just boring, there's just not much to discuss--they sit in a room and count. What you really want to know about is the fraud prevention methods and safeguards.  EDIT: I dug up my comment on a thread that asked this from the past. Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/mdtbny/comment/gsbmma2/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3",mormagils,2022-08-29T15:29:43,1
"Thanks for the information.  And yeah, we kinda went down a rabbit hole a bit with my examples.  I am asking about the methods of voter fraud protections that are in place. I mentioned the counting process really to emphasize that at every step there are representatives of both parties present at every step.  I'd also want to include information about registration, the number of voting machines, basics on storage and maintenance of these machines to prevent manipulation, etc.  I'm still working on the design of the site and what I want to include.  This helps me clarify what I'm looking for going forward.  Thanks!",glov0044,2022-08-29T15:58:58,1
"The main things we have in place are voter registration, voting being a public record, poll watchers, and paper copies of all votes cast. These things work incredibly well to prevent widespread voter fraud. It is theoretically possible to vote to vote for someone else without too much effort...but voting then as yourself is incredibly risky, and increasing the scale of that would be just about impossible. As in, it would literally be the most impressive covert operation in the history of the world impossible.  Overall, the only real issue we have with voter fraud is isolated events always caught after the fact. It's just not an issue, period, because these measures all work well together to make people basically unable to vote more than once and when they try, we catch them.",mormagils,2022-08-29T16:30:09,1
