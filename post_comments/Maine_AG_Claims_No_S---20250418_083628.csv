"Why are Democrats ignoring the science?  Women are getting broken bones, concussions, suffering brain damage by letting these men into their sport.  Why are we even letting a pencil neck attorney tell us about the safety of what's going on in sports?  Democrats are always quick to point out how unqualified someone is to speak.  And let's not forget about ""believe all women"" and ""You don't get an opinion unless you have a vajay-jay"" crowds.",j3remy2007,2025-04-18T08:46:12,74

You have to remember that these lunatics think women can be men and vice versa.  Women can get seriously hurt going up in a contact sport at this level. This ain't your U10 recreational league sporting event that you have at the local Parks and Rec department that you signed up your kid for $20 a season.,pbnjandmilk,2025-04-18T11:59:00,3

"‚ÄúThere are no concerns about individuals who are just choosing which gender they want to give themself in order to participate,‚Äù  Notice how he specifically didn‚Äôt say men in women‚Äôs sports.
