"As per [original article](https://www.thedailybeast.com/60-minutes-thumbs-its-nose-at-trump-with-scathing-segment-on-his-threats-to-law-firms/) 📰:  - 60 Minutes examined Donald Trump’s revenge tour against Big Law in a scathing episode on Sunday, essentially thumbing its nose at the president’s many complaints about the show and its parent company.  The newsmagazine spoke with lawyers and firms who were targeted by Trump through sweeping executive orders aimed at cutting them off from the federal government—even though it was “nearly impossible to get anyone on camera” for the story, host Scott Pelley admitted.  Marc Elias, a longtime Trump opponent name-dropped in a March executive order, slammed the moves as an assault on the entire legal profession.  “Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system,” Elias said. “And so, when Donald Trump says that I am unethical or that I am undermining his vision of America, I say, ‘Boy, I must be doin’ something right.’”  Elias likened Trump’s executive orders to a mob boss intimidating people in a neighborhood.  “The fact is that these law firms are being told, ‘If you don’t play ball with us, maybe somethin’ really bad will happen to you.’”  Elias first crossed Trump in 2016 when he served as the top lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, then again in 2020 when he defeated Trump’s efforts to contest the election results in court.  Perkins Coie, Elias’ former firm, was among those that have been accused by Trump of “unlawful or unsavory practices” since February for their connections to investigations or cases related to Trump or his allies.  A federal judge permanently blocked the executive order against Perkins Coie last week, calling it “unconstitutional retaliation.”  Trump’s executive orders against law firms follow a pattern, including revoking a law firm’s security clearances to access federal buildings and ordering the termination of any contracts the government has with them.  The orders have triggered a crisis in the legal profession as some law firms sue the Trump administration and others stave off punishment by agreeing to do pro bono work for the administration.  Nine major firms have so far gone to the White House to strike a deal with Trump, altogether agreeing to give nearly $1 billion in legal services to causes supported by the president.  One of them was Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the world’s fifth-largest law firm, which agreed in March to do $100 million worth of pro bono work for the Trump administration.  A lawyer named Brenna Frey left the firm in protest.  “The law firm is tacitly saying, we’ll listen to the administration, we won’t fight in court,” she told 60 Minutes. “If we won’t fight over this, what else won’t we fight over in court against the federal government?”  John Keker, a high-profile attorney in San Francisco, suggested that Trump was running a protection racket.  “I’m suggesting that he is violating the rule that says, ‘You can’t offer a thing of value in return for an official act.’ That happens to be the definition of bribery,” he said. “Anybody else who came to Washington and said, ‘I will give you $100 million of free legal services if you do this for me,’ would be convicted of a bribe.”  Not even 60 Minutes itself has been spared from Trump’s retribution campaign. Paramount, CBS’ parent company, is itself embroiled in a legal battle with the government.  The president regularly flames 60 Minutes in Truth Social posts, reportedly prompting Paramount boss Shari Redstone to ask the show to hold off on stories critical of Trump until a crucial corporate merger is approved.  At the end of last week’s episode, 60 Minutes scorched its owners for bending to Trump, which pushed the show’s longtime chief Bill Owens to depart.  “Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger. The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways,” Pelley said. “Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires… No one here is happy about it, but in resigning, Bill proved one thing—he was the right person to lead 60 Minutes all along.”",T_Shurt,2025-05-04T22:05:08,6565

"On top of that the criminal justice system deferred a criminal sentence against Trump. That didn't make the catch and kill go away, it made it an accepted industry practice. The penalty for the Business Fraud is now a personal one between Trump and the Media Heads. Catch and Kill is now the standard operating procedure with this administration.  Previously when a court would defer a sentence it was in the Wild West and the individual would be declared an outlaw. They operate in complete bad faith outside of the law so the law affords them no protection. The sheriff would do nothing to stop society from taking what they were due at any opportunity. The law could act outside of the law. But Trump gets to have the AG behind his back, saying on behalf of the people as their attorney that they wouldn't ever investigate Trump.  Jeff Sessions didn't go along with this plan the first time around and led to Mueller being appointed special prosecutor. Now Trump points to the AG and says, ""talk to my attorney about Constitutionality. But the AG concerns themselves with criminal law, not Constitutional Law.  With Trump pointing to Bondi at his attorney, he is admitting his actions are unconstitutional, but are not criminal because a President cannot commit a crime.

Critics say that isn’t true, and we asked the school district who said they weren’t doing it.”  That still elevates the story far above what it should be; which is the equivalent of a chain email. Especially because they often portray the people making false claims as sympathetic characters before they relay the insane claims/lies/etc. It’s not enough to just say “we couldn’t verify this and some critics disagree” or present the “other side” when one side is objectively true and the other one is bullshit.

> What source for history is acceptable to you? The library of congress? Wikipedia? Harvard library?  All 3 together. With citations. Which is what ChatGPT needs to list out for me to take it's answer seriously.,Keshire,2025-05-05T08:51:00,4
"And what if it said he didn't star in Con Air?  What if it also spits out that you are a serial burglar and then a potential employer runs your name through that system and it sees that ""fact"" even though it's not true. Data sets can be easily skewed.  When this shit runs unchecked it can create chaos that's not easily repairable. We are just in the early stages of it and nobody wants to look forward to the more nefarious future applications.  Whatever though. You want to use it, go ahead.

"Don't know what to tell you, here is their discussion from back then shying away from calling statements lies or liars, liars by hiding behind the definition of ""lie""  https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/25/511503605/npr-and-the-l-word-intent-is-key  ""We can't read Trump's thoughts so we can't accurately call his statements lies, or call him a liar"" is what it boils down to.

"[Found it.](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2025/04/30/trump-voters-first-100-days) I think it's possible you're mis-remembering the conversation.  Within the first 2 minutes Robin responds to the woman with ""Not really"" and then fact checks her claims that American companies are manufacturing goods here.  She also interrupted to corrected the man claiming that the constitution only applies to US citizens in the context of immigrants being deported without due process.

"Yeah, as an average citizen looking for basic information I'm going to look at what been known as a reputable source and call it good.  I'm not going to go to three or four different sources every time I look up some information - which is several times a day.  Good on you for taking the due diligence I guess.

">What if it also spits out that you are a serial burglar and then a potential employer runs your name through that system and it sees that ""fact"" even though it's not true.  Because I have common sense and I would hope any future employer would as well.  If not, then I don't want to work for them.  And sure, you can keep moving the goal posts and say ""what if a lawyer uses cGPT to argue in court?"" or ""what if an airline pilot uses it to check coordinates?"".  Then again I would say, that's dumb and lacks common sense.    We were talking about a redditor getting some general history about the world and you're throwing a hissy fit that ChatGPT is unreliable and shouldn't be used for anything without looking at three different sources.",HurricaneSalad,2025-05-05T09:32:55,-1
"lol like everyday people are reading references listed on Wikipedia pages. What you say is true, but unfortunately people who aren’t academics aren’t doing research regardless, so using an LLM is much better in that it actually does include multiple sources within training data. And are starting to actually include citations in some cases. You’re fighting a losing battle… be glad the person asked a question rather than coming to a conclusion based on a TikTok post lol",2053_Traveler,2025-05-05T10:08:59,-1
"Again, I ask you:  >What good is journalism if they call something a lie without proof, then get sued in court and inevitably shut down either through an adverse ruling or financial attrition?  The article you shared explicitly says they avoided calling things they could not prove were lies lies, and to only report factual, verified information, and your take is ""they won't call lies lies"", while ignoring the fact that they would be sued into the ground if they called something a lie that they could not prove in court was a lie.

"At 9:40 - ""He's a business man who can pull himself up by his bootstraps. He's self funded and doesn't need anyone's money"" - I tuned in at around the 7:00 mark in my car.  To my initial point. I was upset to hear that at the end ""Well we will check in with you in the future"" was the closing statement and not followed up with any other analysis to the listener like, ""Even though these statements made at the end of the conversation reflected their personal opinions, the reality is..."" More and more news outlets want to move on to the next topic/story. I totally understand time constraints, (it may have been top of the hour and they need to move on) but if you are just casually airing opinions without any follow up fact checking you are impacting folks, like me who just tune in at the end of these segments, and think, ""Well, I guess he does pull himself up by his bootstraps because he isn't taking a salary"".",DDaddyDunk,2025-05-05T10:33:20,2
