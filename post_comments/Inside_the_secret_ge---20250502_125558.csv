"It also means pouring more tax dollars into defending those minerals and reconstruction efforts.  The deal starts with US investment at zero, meaning if the US doesn’t continue to invest, they get nothing.  All the billions in aid previously provided is Ukraine’s to keep for free.  Then, if Ukraine loses access to the land militarily, and they are hurting for manpower, (conscription slavery of young Ukrainian men) then the US can’t mine shit and get nothing in return. It’s a gamble.  The war isn’t magically over just because of this, in fact, this deal almost guarantees the war isn’t over unless Russia folds entirely and I don’t see Putin’s ego allowing that",BattleIllustrious680,2025-05-03T07:56:52,-1
