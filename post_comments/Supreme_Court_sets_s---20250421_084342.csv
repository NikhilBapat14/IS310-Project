"I believe that District judges should only be able to do injunctions for their district, not nationwide.  That is why you have an appeals process.  But let’s see if SCOTUS agrees with that assessment.  I am hoping.",mdws1977,2025-04-21T09:30:10,94
"Take a listen to Ted Cruz's podcast ['Verdict with Ted Cruz' ](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-verdict-with-ted-cruz-56253661/episode/dems-double-down-on-illegal-alien-gang-members-shocking-supreme-court-decision-halting-deportations-273022174/?cmp=android_share&sc=android_social_share&pr=false) from today. In the last segment Ted outlines the tricks used to guarantee a stay. Basically it boils down to timing tricks, waking justices in the middle of the night with a 100+ page appeal and they say ""I can't go through all of this before the deadline. Let's put a stay on things until all the material can be reviewed and a proper judgement can be given.""",HoleyerThanThou,2025-04-21T09:42:39,42
"Possible, but likely? Four separate district courts and three appeals courts have maintained the injunctions. The Supreme Court would be bucking the trend.  I agree with the article that the birthright case may not be the best ‘vehicle’ to rein in national injunctions, but we’ll see.  No paywall: https://archive.ph/IIMKk",zip117,2025-04-21T09:29:34,22
"This Court should declare that enough is enough before district courts’ burgeoning reliance on universal injunctions becomes further entrenched,” acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in the emergency filing. She urged the justices to limit the rulings to the individual plaintiffs and jurisdictions involved, which would allow the administration to proceed with its efforts in other jurisdictions.  The trio of cases, consolidated together for one hour of oral arguments in the middle of May, offers the justices a direct opportunity to address growing concerns over judicial overreach.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-21T11:05:11,9
we will see. to me the motion and or case they will be considering is not robust enough to assist them finalizing a nationwide injunction rule.   they need more appeals from lower courts on nationwide injunctions to review a breadth of legal reasoning pro and con,SerendipitySue,2025-04-21T14:33:08,3

Yes nationwide injunctions do not make sense for district judges. That only leads to corruption.,kaytin911,2025-04-21T09:34:03,60
"i agree.  congress == POTUS == SCOTUS   NOT lower judges > POTUS  if the lower courts object, they can file for it to be looked at by their next highest court.  just like in the military, you have to go UP the chain till you get to the top, not go right to the general with your problem.",_Vardos_,2025-04-21T10:10:09,36
I’m a big fan of Ted Cruz’ Verdict! I don’t hear it referenced much here on Reddit. Thanks for the pointer and I’ll give it a listen later today.  Also on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/verdict-with-ted-cruz/id1495601614).,zip117,2025-04-21T11:27:21,14
"Imagine if a conservative lower court had issued a nationwide injunction on performing any abortion while the *Dobbs* case worked its way up to the Supreme Court.    I know ""our side"" had a couple of these go against Biden, like the student loan thing.  And we probably wished that there was an injunction against the vaccine mandates while they went through the courts.  But there has to be a better way to handle contentious issues while they're in the court pipeline.",JerseyKeebs,2025-04-21T11:27:06,21
Yep the problem is everyone knows which judges will vote which way before the cases even come to their courtrooms. You file suit in the appropriate jurisdiction and the injunction you want is a sure thing regardless of merit.,Material-Afternoon16,2025-04-21T11:46:00,25

I think this is the far bigger problem that needs addressing on an epic scale. The concept of justice has gone right out the window (if it ever was there). There should be an expectation of judicial neutrality; and severe punishments for failing to adhere to it.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-22T00:08:34,6
