"The problem is that they are going to drive. It’s better to have them register and get insurance than to just drive illegally.  Removing their ability to legally drive is just going to increase hit and runs, illegal drivers, and insurance rates for the rest of us.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-27T09:21:24,27
"If I am going to be involved in an accident, I had rather the other driver lawfully present or not is insured, rather than not insured, patriotic ctizen. The states that permit thought in terms of insurance coverage to protect other drivers, and the state license is a special restricted one that provide right to drive only. It also allowed state with ready access to their whereabouts should that need arise. They all require sufficient identification, and DMVs are in the domain of each respective state's jurisdiction.     > While they’re not asked for proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residence status, applicants must provide identifying documents such as an unexpired foreign passport or a certified birth certificate issued by a foreign jurisdiction.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-27T09:30:43,9

"Question: This also apply to the foreign tourists who rent a car to drive through the USA from Florida to California? According to the news of the last few days, you can very quickly go from a legal foreigner to an illegal. Not that so many tourists still want to visit us.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-27T10:50:23,2
Can we stop some of the awful America citizen drivers from driving?,Designer-Contract852,2025-04-27T11:32:28,2
I don't think undocumented immigrants should be in the country.    But some number are in the country and always will be.  And at least some of them will be driving cars.  So I think it's better they have to pass a driving test than just being on the road without knowing the rules of American roads.,box-cable,2025-04-27T09:25:49,5
What? Outlawing people from driving based on immigration status sounds dangerous and discriminatory. How are people supposed to get to their immigration appointments if they’re cut off from a major mode of transportation?,jayclaw97,2025-04-27T21:51:30,1
How can it be unlawful and legal at the same time?  Edit:  The headline could use a revision.,capaho,2025-04-27T09:43:28,0

"A tourist would still have an unexpired foreign driver's license presumably, unless they just got the timing wrong or are grossly overstaying their visa/Esta/etc (thus making them an illegal immigrant anyway)",TehWildMan_,2025-04-27T10:54:15,1

"This status of legal presence is also getting tricky.  Thousands of students here on visa's just had their visa's revoked by the Trump admin last month, and **were not informed.** Technically they are now illegal - and they were not even informed.  Hundreds of thousands were here legally as refugeees whose TPS status was revoked giving them 30 days to leave.  Can you move to a foreign country in 30 days?",terraresident,2025-04-27T14:15:36,2

"It's not.  Being in the country without documentation is one thing, driving is another.  Just like driving on the freeway is legal, and speeding on the freeway is illegal.  You can be doing something legal and something unlawful at the same time.     However if you're driving on the freeway without a license, and speeding on the freeway too, then both things are illegal.",tracyinge,2025-04-27T09:55:11,2

No such thing as an illegal human.  That’s just a term invented by racist news organizations like Fox News.  The term is undocumented immigrant,Cyndakill88,2025-04-27T09:31:55,10

"Technically the IDP is only a translation, and if your licence is in English to begin with, it’s not needed.   But yea a tourist can drive on a foreign licence for up to 180 days I think, it’s all has to do with Geneva convention on road traffic, same one where the IDP is defined in as well. ",traumalt,2025-04-28T03:41:20,1

"because accuracy matters more than your feelings.  ""Illegal"" describes the *action* taken — violating immigration laws.   it's not dehumanizing to call an action what it is. it’s dehumanizing to treat words like sacred talismans that can rewrite reality if you just cry about them hard enough.  you’re not owed a special euphemism to soften the consequences of breaking into a country.   you don’t get to hide behind language games because the facts make you uncomfortable.  this whole “dehumanizing” argument is just a cheap guilt trap to shut down real discussion.   nobody said they aren’t people.   we’re saying they aren’t supposed to be here.   simple as that.  if your worldview collapses because someone used an accurate word, maybe it wasn’t built on much in the first place.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-27T09:59:34,-10
"calling it ""undocumented"" is just corporate-approved word laundering.  it’s not racist to point out that if you enter a country outside its laws, you broke the law.   doesn’t matter if you’re the sweetest person alive or the devil himself — it’s the act, not your feelings about it.  changing the label doesn’t change the reality.   ""Undocumented"" is just PR spin to make illegal actions sound like a minor paperwork mistake, like someone forgot to renew their library card instead of deliberately bypassing a nation's borders and rules.  no one's saying humans are illegal in their existence.   but actions have legal status. choices have consequences.   pretending otherwise is just emotional manipulation designed to erase the concept of a border altogether without ever having an honest debate about it.  and btw...it wasn’t Fox News that invented ""illegal immigrant.""   it was federal law, decades before Fox even existed.  but yeah sure...keep acting like vocabulary trickery is going to save a collapsing system from its own contradictions.   rebranding reality doesn’t stop it from cracking apart under your feet.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-27T09:58:27,-10
">""Illegal"" describes the *action* taken  So the J6 terrorists, Steve Bannon, Dinesh D'Souza, Paul Manafort, Peter Navarro, Roger Stone, and Trump himself should all properly be referred to as ""illegals"" because of the actions they have taken . . . for the sake of accuracy, of course, not because they're not people.",Interesting_Play_578,2025-04-27T11:05:49,2
>if your worldview collapses because someone used an accurate word  Ironically it's you whose world view would collapse. On e you start thinking of immigrants as actual humans it becomes harder to hate them doesn't it?,NeanaOption,2025-04-27T11:00:59,1
"So by your logic it is the action being illegal that makes someone “illegal”.  Ok cool anyone that gets a speeding ticket is illegal, got it.  Anyone who doesn’t pick up after their dog going poop, that makes them illegal! Vocabulary isn’t the problem here, it’s you inability to think of more than 4 sentences ahead",Cyndakill88,2025-04-27T10:07:28,5
">changing the label doesn’t change the reality. ""Undocumented"" is just PR   Actually calling them illegal is the PR spin.
