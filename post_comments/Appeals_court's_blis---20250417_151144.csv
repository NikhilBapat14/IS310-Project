">“The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,” he continued. “Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”",LolAtAllOfThis,2025-04-17T15:12:15,56
Serious question but what are we supposed to do with the guy if he is returned? He was denied asylum multiple times.,adamcmorrison,2025-04-17T15:43:31,-40
"At the absolute worst, deport him to his home country after a hearing.  The US constitution is very clear about the right to challenge your detention (first article), the right to a trial (6th and 7th amendments), and protections against cruel and unusual punishment (8th amendment) These folks are getting NONE of these.  It’s wildly unconstitutional.",AreasonableAmerican,2025-04-17T15:48:47,35
Yeah I get it we shouldn’t do that. 100% agree. But there is some irony there that we’re trying to get this guy back to deport him again.,adamcmorrison,2025-04-17T15:51:22,-37
“This guy” could be anyone if due process isn’t followed.,Wildly_Distracted,2025-04-17T16:17:48,33
He has a court order against deporting him...   Trumps SS wants to deport him again... It's up to the courts AND US to stop nazism.   Bring him back. Court ordered lrotection from the feds. We the People camp out to make sure he's safe.   This is why the 2A exists.,ZoomZoom_Driver,2025-04-17T16:43:34,13
"Right - that absolutely might happen. But Abrego deserves his day in court. He could be a piece of shit, he could be a great guy. It really doesn't matter. It is about the rule of law.",Polackjoe,2025-04-17T23:48:32,3
"Deporting someone to their home country is HUGELY different from deporting someone to one of the worst prisons in the world in a completely different country altogether, like are you serious?   He shouldn’t be deported at all without due process, but to say those two options are anywhere near comparable is a joke.",ramfrommars,2025-04-18T00:28:57,2
Yeah understood,adamcmorrison,2025-04-17T16:21:20,0
"Yeah but that court order is just a stay of removal. It doesn’t mean he stays, just that they want to look at the case still right?",adamcmorrison,2025-04-17T16:47:52,-18
"No. He is an asylum seeker who is under death threats if returned home...   He was given the right to stay here long-term while his case was decided.   His case has NOT been decided by the courts, which is the LEGAL PROCESS, but by racists with an agenda and no legal standing.   A judge ordered he stay in the US. The gov IGNORED a judge and sent him abroad.   MORE judges order the US to turn the planearound. They were ALSO ignored.   The judges told trump to return him to the US. Trump ignored that and plead to SCOTUS for telief from the order.   In a UNANIMOUS decision, SCOTUS declined trumps request and said the lower court order stands. I.e. trump  HAS TO return him. Also ignored.   Yesterday, a judge said that because he hasnt been returned then the executive is in contempt of the equal and separate branch (the judiciary).   Earlier this week, a judge ordered ALL kidnappings and extractions to el salvador be stopped immediately. Trumps SS nazis are STILL sending americans to concentration camps.   And, i do mean AMERICANS. abrego has a US wife and US daughter and has been here decades. He is legally allowed to be here. He IS an American. Legally allowed to live in America means that he has a RIGHT to due process, which was ignored; a roght to a trial, ignored; right to court-remediated sentence free of cruel and unusual punishments, ignored...   And to make matters worse, an AMERICAN BORN CITIZEN woth a hispanic last name has been unconatitutionally held by ICE and a judge doesn't think they have the power to get him back.   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/us-born-citizen-detained-ice-immigration-florida-rcna201800  So, you're either against this kidnapping and extraction to a foreign concentration camps, or you're a damn nazi.",ZoomZoom_Driver,2025-04-17T16:58:23,19
