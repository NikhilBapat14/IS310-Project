"No large scale wars going on but also no large scale societal injustices like ethnic cleansing or massive violent oppressions. If a dictator is ethnically cleansing a region by forcing everyone from the ""wrong ethnicity"" out then I wouldn't classify that as ""world peace"" even if there isn't a war going on.  Overall though I think it's less helpful to imagine ""what is world peace"" and more to ask ""how can we move in the direction of fewer wars and more just societies."" Generally speaking we live in a pretty peaceful era compared to the previous centuries but there are signs that we could be moving towards more frequent wars. Additionally we've been seeing the number of democracies decline both in quantity and quality since they peaked in the early 2000s. We may never fully see ""world peace"" but we can move towards an era of fewer wars, more trade and more freedom. We can also move in the opposite direction.",socialistrob,2025-03-06T01:03:28,10
"I consider World Peace without having large scale wars like the first or second. But we are not in full World Peace because there are still conflicts in the world that have been going on for a long time or are just beginning.  And the reason we have World Peace is because of the atomic bomb, creating a weapon in which everyone loses and there are no winners. That reminder that you will never win nuclear war makes countries take other paths to avoid that end of the world scenario. You can say that this invention is bad, but don't deny that this has reduced large scale wars and they are now smaller.",Isacobs_35160_LHM,2025-03-05T21:10:40,6

"I’d argue that it’s also important to consider the type of peace we’re taking about. If we emphasize negative peace, or the absence of war, that’s one way of approaching the world with a clear goal in mind: to eradicate large-scale conflict.  However, a more productive and potentially more realistic approach is one with the goal of positive peace; an active campaign to promote cooperation and healthy relationships on the global scale.   While conflict is a phenomenon inherent to humanity, cooperation is, in many cases, a preferable alternative to competition that produces better results for all parties involved. So, perhaps the approach should not necessarily be to end conflict, but instead, to facilitate the expansion of cooperation with the eventual goal of overcoming the differences that cause conflict in the first place.",JaboiJablowski,2025-03-06T01:34:06,2
The beginning of world peace is nations no longer fighting each other but working together towards a common goal. The end of world peace would be when everyone works together towards a common goal without fighting. Then it becomes the standard and world peace loses its meaning without violence being present.,listenering,2025-03-06T02:55:03,1

">But others would say that world peace is when there is literally no violence in the world what so ever  This is the first time I have heard this definition of ""world peace"". It seems so unrealistic and extreme as to be counterproductive.  I would classify world peace as no active wars between sovereign countries, and also no large-scale efforts to overthrow or degrade rival countries (cyber-warfare, aggressive espionage, economic warfare, or propaganda campaigns). Insurgencies, internal riots/uprisings and even infrequent, smaller terrorist attacks might take place even in a situation that could be categorized as ""world peace"".    The complete absence of violence is an unrealistic goal until we can hack the human genome to counteract the natural side effects of our evolution.",judge_mercer,2025-03-06T13:03:38,1
Not being afraid to travel to a large number of countries because they are either in an active war or just completely failed states.  There will always be some level of dispute settled by violence.  But that is different than major powers fighting directly or by numerous and continuous proxy wars.  Same with non-state actors with either their own power structure or multiple state sponsors.,WisdomOrFolly,2025-03-06T21:20:39,1

I think world peace has to include general lack of exploitation as well. Exploitation is an act of violence in my mind.,kittenTakeover,2025-03-06T08:34:58,1

"Our current era is literally called ""The Long Peace"" due to the unprecedentedly long period in which there has been no war between the Great Powers. This is the longest period of peace in centuries, potentially going back to the era of the Roman Empire depending on how you define it.  This has happened because the United States has asserted itself as the global hegemon. You're welcome, everyone.",WavesAndSaves,2025-03-05T21:38:10,-2
"Agreed. Your definition is succinct and I think it's accurate. I think some level of justice also needs to be included with a reasonable definition of ""world peace"" to make it a goal worth pursuing. If for instance we could end war but the entire world had to live under the control of the Taliban or ISIS then I don't think that would be worth doing even if it means ""world peace"" according to some definitions. Things like genocide, slavery or apartheid (whether that's racial, gender or something else) to me is incompatible with a ""world peace.""   Some level of violent crime or state sanctioned violence to stop it is not incompatible with world peace but any level of systemic societal violence is incompatible with world peace even if the victims of that violence aren't actively shooting the perpetrators are organizing into battalions.",socialistrob,2025-03-07T13:41:08,3

"Proper stewardship of that role would have involved onboarding as many different responsible countries into the arrangement as possible, because something like this situation was inevitable.
