"As an Illinois resident. The Pritzker family are what billionaires should be.   ARE THEY SILLY RICH? Yes. They also do tons of philanthropy and things for the arts and sciences.   I recall some years ago when the planetarium in Chicago wanted a moon rock from NASA (this was a huge deal then) but couldn't afford it. They called the Pritzker family and the response was apparently as simple as ""just tell us how much you need"".  Their foundation gives out millions. And its not like just JB is the billionaire. It's a family affair.   I want him to stay governor.... but he would also make a damn good president. He's fixed so much in Illinois so quickly.",ThiefofNobility,2025-05-06T20:32:05,126

"I don’t know what she’s expecting to find in Springfield, Illinois. It’s 3+ hours south of Chicago amid miles of corn, soybean, and hog country. It’s the whitest part of the state. I don’t think there are even immigrant farm workers - everything is done with massive rolling farm machines.   Perhaps she’s meeting with Republican lawmakers, but wtf.  Trumps entire administration thinks running the government is performance art.",PensiveObservor,2025-05-07T01:02:54,6

"Springfield and surrounding areas have a significant Mexican population.  You have to go further south to get to the whitest part of the state.  Source: me. I grew up 30 minutes from the previous Republican gubernatorial candidate. It's sooooo white south of Rt 36, but especially south of Rt 50.
