"Only we can save our democracy. How many of you got out to protest yesterday? I did. My wife did. We need to, in numbers so large they cannot be ignored",Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-02T06:06:00,30
"The problem is that so many millions of people have been radicalized and toxified by Trump that it's hard to win them back.  What's needed is a carefully planned deradicalization program that brings into sharp focus why Trump is so toxic and so dangerous for America.  One thing that's especially needed is a nationwide publicity campaign that highlights in simple, everyday terms the eye-watering sums of money Trump has personally made from the presidency, for example his golfing scam and his insider trading, plus countless other exploitative and totally immoral actions.  This campaign should then contrast the billions he has made with the suffering of millions of ordinary Americans, thanks to his heartless policies.",crazybones,2025-05-02T06:56:10,9

"“The writer is a former US diplomat who wishes to remain anonymous”  Honestly, the guardian is helping no one by publishing this and publishing it under anonymous.   This article is frankly ridiculous. I’d honestly like to know who’s begging other countries to come and save us from ourselves. Isolating the US and recruiting talent is already happening, they didn’t need to be told. As an aside, they kinda let anyone become a diplomat (especially if they donate $$$) so that credential is meaningless.   Also I have one of those lend-lease teapots too.",Cat-on-the-printer1,2025-05-02T09:12:29,3
"It’s American’s responsibility to save them/ourselves. I say that as only a naturalised citizen. The maga voters are just being themselves. It’s these ones - the remaining 1/3 who ‘don’t do politics’. The people who have an excuse for every single day of the week for not being able to protest. The ones who won’t do any action against trump, who won’t research even small actions against trump unless that action is handed to them with clear instructions on what to do. As a former Commonwealther, our previous generations sacrificed hugely in WW1 and WW2 (don’t get me started on the US late arrival), the idea that you can’t give up non essential kids activities on the weekend to protest is…something. And the ignorance about labour’s role in democracy (as well as general distaste of unionism). ",Wide-Lunch6962,2025-05-02T09:23:14,3
"But you don’t want our help.   You need to build on knowledge, but you resent facts.   You need to save people from poverty, but you want to believe in trickle-down economics.   You need empower people to allow them to elect representatives who will fight for their interests, but you want to keep the duopoly that effectively precludes it.   You need to defend yourself against foreign influence and interference, but you abhor regulations that are needed to ensure this.   And you have people and movements _within your country_ who already fight for all these causes. But you don’t vote for them.   If you want help, you need to change. But you don’t want to change. And then we can’t help you. ",FailingToLurk2023,2025-05-02T07:18:50,14
You won't be able to save American democracy until you properly fund the American education system. Unfortunately DJT and the Republicans are doing the reverse.,Phreeload,2025-05-02T09:35:57,2
It would be nice if the various intergovernmental Group Summits just stopped inviting the US to the table. The G7 meets in Canada in June and even Zelenskyy has been invited. G-20 meets in November in South Africa.  I'd love to see Trump's face when he learns he's not invited to the party!,SwvellyBents,2025-05-02T10:20:11,2

"It´s not Trump, the whole elite failed. So many crimanals rigged the US-system over time, it was just time someone grap the power alltogether, But if you look at the PISA study, you will see they crashed their public education. Only the 10% richest kids can compete with the rest of the world.  It was a project for decades, nothing short to decades could fix it. They must do the work for themself and we could help with UN money for public education there,  Nothing would work if they can´t read or learnt to think critical. There is no shortcut.     Think about European leaders and Trump, worlds between them, and it might be a hint for the US people alltogether.",nick5erd,2025-05-02T10:10:08,1

">  How many of you got out to protest yesterday?  Our American protests are more like campaign rallies. They are not going to more the government into making changes. European style protests are what that can make government change.   As an example, this is how French farmers protest.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz5bMpBYQjw",xibeno9261,2025-05-02T08:46:38,8

"Agreed, I find it astonishing that protests are not growing exponentially each time they are held.   This tells me that they don’t care about what is happening unless it affects them personally.   These protests will fizzle out if the numbers don’t start getting drastically larger. Every single day new Executive Orders are being issued and chipping away at our democracy.",Medium_Green6700,2025-05-02T09:40:52,2
"> *""The first responsibility of the leaders of other countries, is to do what's best for *their* country.""*    This is correct.  The leaders of the other countries were elected by the corresponding electorates in their nation's to work for the people of those nations.  That is their responsibility.     > *""it's what Americans knowingly voted for.""*    How do we know that they didn't actually want this?  More than 1/3 *actively* chose this path.  Despite him being elected previously and doing a terrible job.  As he said himself, they did sign up for this.  He is doing what he said he would do.  It should not be on anyone else to attempt to subvert the overwhelming will of the American electorate.  That subversion would be inherently anti-democratic.    I took issue with the tone and position of the op-ed.  To make statements like we ""owe"" and we ""betrayed"", while in the same vein attempting to request help.  It's quite off-putting.",Postom,2025-05-02T06:30:26,2

Letting the government know that there are millions upon millions of us who object to what they're doing is not a waste of time. You can continue to think it is or you can join them and add another person to the mix. NOT doing anything is EXACTLY what they want. It gives legislators the knowledge they need to do what needs to be done. It was the protests that encouraged Cory Booker that he had the backing of the American people.,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-02T09:33:23,5

You guys are just going about it the wrong way. Nothing you are doing is inconvenient to them. You need to obstruct them at every opportunity. You need to get everyone protesting to D.C. You need to actually sacrifice your comfort and time and possibly livelihood instead of just walking around in circles with signs. We are way past that kind of protesting being effective. The pressure needs to be overwhelming and constant and we are not there right now. Give it a few weeks of empty shelves and marshall law and maybe we will get there. Us Americans have gone soft. We need to protest like the French.,Pegasus7915,2025-05-02T10:05:49,5
