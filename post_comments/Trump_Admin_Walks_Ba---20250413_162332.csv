"The fact that this administration can't come up with a consistent policy is doing more damage to the credibility of the United States than I think even a tariff could. They keep flopping between extremes.  As much as a trade war is bad for all parties, who is going to make future plans when the policy is going to change twice over a *weekend*? Who's going to invest billions of dollars and years of time if maybe—just maybe—the policy will change again and it'll be more economical to manufacture in China or Vietnam or India?  Does this administration even really talk to itself in cabinet meetings and other official forums? Besides heaping adulation on Trump to gain his favor?  I fear that we'll find a world economy revolving around economic and technological prosperity, except for one backwater nation in North America, and I don't mean Mexico.",fivetoedslothbear,2025-04-13T20:12:16,2

"Republicans in power, that’s an abusive relationship in political form. And one strategy abusers use is to say, “if you were with someone else, you’d not do any better” so many times that the abused person starts to believe it and starts to repeat it.   Of course your parents think it and say it. People trapped in abusive relationships often do. ",Jackpot777,2025-04-14T05:05:36,3
