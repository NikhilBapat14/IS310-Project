"The fact that this administration can't come up with a consistent policy is doing more damage to the credibility of the United States than I think even a tariff could.

Who's going to invest billions of dollars and years of time if maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîthe policy will change again and it'll be more economical to manufacture in China or Vietnam or India?  Does this administration even really talk to itself in cabinet meetings and other official forums? Besides heaping adulation on Trump to gain his favor?
