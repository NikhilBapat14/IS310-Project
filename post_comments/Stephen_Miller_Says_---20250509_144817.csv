"""The case Boumediene v. Bush addressed the suspension of habeas corpus for foreign nationals detained at Guantanamo Bay and challenged the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006.

"To translate to English,  Trump is looking to end everyone's constitutional rights.   Every right you have as an American Citizen so that he can do anything he wants to you.    The constitution explicitly says that in a time of war then these rights can be suspended.     I don't think it has happened since the Civil War.   Back then it was needed as confederates would shoot their guns at union soldiers then throw them down and wave the constitution saying they can't be shot at or arrested.  It was needed then but now it's more like Hitler's Reichstag moment where he turned a democracy into a dictatorship.   This is a decision to turn America into a dictatorship",WillSherman1861,2025-05-09T15:47:44,42

Once that happens, some of the military will follow that command and some will stick to their oath to defend the constitution.    This will be our second revolutionary war.    Which side has the greater numbers and the greater control of resources will be the initial frontrunner.  Unless Congress does something in the meantime, I am afraid this is where we are headed.  I suspect Trump and those who control him are just waiting for the right timing to launch this phase (calling of martial law or insurrection act).",PunfullyObvious,2025-05-09T16:49:52,5

Some were moved to less high security prisons. Some were simply released outright, or transferred to other countries with pending criminal charges.  I guess people don't realize the population of Gitmo dwindled after the Supreme Court ruling. Sure, it wasn't like they shut it down overnight - it was actually rather difficult to process these criminals - but, it *did in fact happen*.

"It‚Äôs a valid concern.  However usually the US Marshals would be the ones directed to enforce court orders. There‚Äôs apparently additional legal mechanisms if on or more Marshals refuse to carry out their duty, the courts can deputize others who will follow the lawful orders and fulfill the obligations of the contempt of court ruling.  They also have the power to have assets, money, and property seized which is outside the power of pardons.   Obviously the real power in stopping a rogue executive branch that is ignoring court rulings and orders lies currently with the GOP majority who could simply vote to remove Trump, and Vance, and also advisors and any secretary of almost any department. So until either adults get majority back to end the regime here or the GOP grows a pair and puts country over party, you‚Äôre right we‚Äôre probably in unproven territory regarding the length the courts will go to enforce their rulings.",SayVandalay,2025-05-09T16:04:23,3
