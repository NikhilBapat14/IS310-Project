"“We accidentally deported a very vocal American critic of our administration and deported him to El Salvador, and sent his wife and toddler to Mexico. We don’t have the legal jurisdiction to negotiate his release with another nation - and his family was unfortunately massacred by the cartel.”",acceptance1085,2025-04-07T19:54:41,1

"Trump can invoke Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members after 5-4 ruling, but with caveats  The [US supreme court](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court) on Monday allowed Donald Trump to use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president’s hardline approach to immigration, but with certain limits.  The court, in an unsigned 5-4 ruling, granted the administration’s request to lift Washington-based US judge James Boasberg’s 15 March order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues.",duderos,2025-04-07T19:22:17,1

The limits are essentially meaningless though because the people who are kidnapped can only challenge their detention via a habeas petition in the areas where they're being held.  So when the Trump administration transports them all to Texas they can only challenge their detention in the 5th circuit which will never rule against Trump.,kyleb402,2025-04-07T19:45:40,1

"Despite siding with the administration, the court’s majority placed limits on how deportations may occur, emphasizing that judicial review is required.  Detainees “must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the majority wrote.
