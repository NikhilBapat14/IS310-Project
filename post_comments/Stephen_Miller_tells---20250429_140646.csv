"Miller being this out in front says a lot. Dude stuck his neck out for these shit policies that are destroying their poll numbers.  What drives me nuts is a lot of what they're trying to do could be done much more effectively AND humanely. It's like the cruelest parts of this shit are also the parts that everyone hates, and they're the parts that keep getting shut down in the courts.  For instance, just with the federal government they could have easily instituted a hiring freeze and hit their numbers within a year just from attrition. Then take the time to implement a proper RIF, and you're there! The people being let go get the usual help through the RIF process, you hit your goals, and you can manage the cuts so your constituents don't feel it.  Even with immigration, if they just took fucking a day or two to validate that they're sending the right people away no one would have ever cared. Should they care anyway? Absolutely. But it's specifically the deporting of people who should not be deported that's getting them into trouble.  I really can't tell where the cruelty ends and the stupidity begins with these people. I can't even really blame Trump (I mean I do but still) because he's not the guy who's supposed to be crossing the t's and dotting the i's. An economy in shambles and approval ratings in the gutter because no one in the administration can be bothered to do things the right way.",GreenAnder,2025-04-29T16:30:05,15
