I get Greenlands hesitation and anger at how Trump has played things. But the long and short of it is that they would be better off as a US territory than a Danish one. Native Greenlanders could negotiate and secure the greatest social welfare subsidy in the history of Earth and it would be cheap compared to the economic and strategic value they and their land would provide.   Alas the double edged nature of Trump's communication strikes again.,Spartanlegion117,2025-05-01T18:57:16,-3
