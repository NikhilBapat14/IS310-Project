"But not Hegseth, who is too busy installing make up counters in the pentagon.",pethanct01,2025-05-01T10:42:00,43
"The first sacrificial lamb of many to come. To trump, they're all chattel, replaceable goons, useful idiots and scapegoats. His replacement will be briefed on the importance of keeping the administration's illegal actions concealed.",LW_GLAZER,2025-05-01T10:42:32,8
Make Whiskey Pete waltz out next.,ScrubNickle,2025-05-01T10:40:33,3
This is just the beginning folks…,OliviaBenson_20,2025-05-01T10:43:37,2
Whoever replaces him will likely be worse. Laura loomer wanted him fired for not being “loyal” enough which means he actually had his own opinions,whyyy66,2025-05-01T11:00:40,2
I expect him to sell his books few months from now.,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-01T10:41:46,1
Hope he’s grateful to be named official Scape goat,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-01T11:01:45,1
"Well, obviously this guy was picked after ol’ Sleeping Car Joe did one of his Jedi Malarky tricks on Donoldsaur.",LuvKrahft,2025-05-01T11:05:01,1
Which is the opposite of what Trump has claimed about the Signal issue and the GOP just blocked the investigation. This appears to be firing the guy who has a relationship with the reporter who doesn’t like Trump and not accountability for what happened.,Morepastor,2025-05-01T11:21:37,1
Looking forward for my Democratic Senator to confirm the next clown in this circus.,anemone_within,2025-05-01T11:47:16,1
Waltz was at least competent. Can't have that in this administration.,Frekingstonker,2025-05-01T12:05:07,1
Aww please can we get a twofer and dump Whiskey Pete too,Ninjakat57,2025-05-01T20:23:49,1
He’ll be gone too,OliviaBenson_20,2025-05-01T10:43:47,10
"Not if he says “yes” enough with big strong tears running down his manly cheeks.   Trump has this fantasy thing he talks about a lot, where men, he’ll call them big and strong, come up to him crying while kissing his ass.  It’s weird.",LuvKrahft,2025-05-01T10:50:12,10
Hegseth is too much of a fuck up to fire now. If he gets the axe it is Trump eating crow which he will never do. They can't simultaneously pretend the signal leak was no big deal and get rid of the perpetrator.,Unsourced_hearsay,2025-05-01T10:51:53,5
"“…and he came up to me and said, ‘sir, I know I made a mistake, but don’t fire me. Give me a chance to prove I am a proud Patriot.’”",jaqueburton,2025-05-01T11:51:11,2
"They can...  Just frame it as ""Peter Hegseth decided to leave his position at the White House to spend more time with booze and cocaine""",coatofforearm,2025-05-01T10:56:09,6
He’ll be gone,OliviaBenson_20,2025-05-01T10:55:37,1
