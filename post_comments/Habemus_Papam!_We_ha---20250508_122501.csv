"‚ÄúIn 2000, Prevost allowed Father James Ray, an Augustinian priest, to reside at St. John Stone Friary in Chicago. Ray had been suspended from public ministry since 1991 due to credible accusations of sexual abuse of minors. Although the priory was close to a Catholic elementary school, Prevost did not notify the school administration about Ray. The Augustinians noted that Ray was assigned a monitor while at St. John Stone. Ray was moved to a different residence in 2002 when the US Conference of Catholic Bishops adopted stricter rules for handling priests accused of abusing minors.‚Äù  Source: https://www.pillarcatholic.com/p/vatican-congregation-member-allowed  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_XIV",USMC0317,2025-05-08T12:57:29,21

"And Christ gave authority to his Apostles, chief of which was St. Peter. Do you think a Christian in 40AD didn‚Äôt care for the Church or ‚Äúa man and a hat‚Äù? That they just pledged allegiance to Christ, in whatever way they felt best? And Scripture, most of the New Testament *wasn‚Äôt even written* until decades after Christ‚Äôs Resurrection. The earliest Christians obeyed Christ by obeying his Apostles. And his Apostles passed this authority to successors called bishops. And the Church grew throughout the Roman Empire and beyond, maintaining unity and orthodoxy among the bishops and their flocks.  England and the United States are countries. Nation states rise, and they fall. There is no permanence. The Church Christ founded was One, and has never fallen and never will. It will remain, never overcome by the gates of Hell, until the Lord Jesus Christ returns in glory to judge the living and the dead. And to assert that Christ intended for Christianity to be so fractured and disjointed - a development that didn‚Äôt happen until the Protestant Revolution - is, quite frankly, absurd.",Big_Iron_Cowboy,2025-05-09T08:11:42,0
