"Hmm, according to Fox News and your average MAGA voter, California is this destitute wasteland where homeless, transgender, MS-13 gang members wander around and spend the day wrecking havoc to civilians before returning to their tent encampment they set up in public parks in wealthy areas of the state.   Don't know how such a place can have such a large economy! /s",walkallover1991,2025-04-25T08:33:41,19

"The article: California‚Äôs economy has surpassed Japan‚Äôs, making the Golden state the fourth largest economy in the world, Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday.  The state‚Äôs nominal GDP reached $4.1tn, according to data from the International Monetary Fund and the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, edging out Japan‚Äôs $4.02tn nominal GDP. California now ranks behind the US at $29.18tn, China at $18.74tn and Germany at $4.65tn.  Along with the tech and entertainment industry capitals, the state, which has a population of nearly 40 million people, is the center for US manufacturing output and is the country‚Äôs largest agricultural producer.  ‚ÄúCalifornia isn‚Äôt just keeping pace with the world ‚Äì we‚Äôre setting the pace. Our economy is thriving because we invest in people, prioritize sustainability, and believe in the power of innovation,‚Äù Newsom said in a statement.  The state has outperformed the world‚Äôs top economies with a growth rate in 2024 of 6% compared with the US‚Äôs 5.3%, China‚Äôs 2.6% and Germany‚Äôs 2.9%. This week‚Äôs new rankings come six years after California surpassed the United Kingdom and became the world‚Äôs fifth largest economy.  Newsom noted, however, that the Trump administration‚Äôs agenda endangers California‚Äôs economic interests.  ‚ÄúAnd, while we celebrate this success, we recognize that our progress is threatened by the reckless tariff policies of the current federal administration. California‚Äôs economy powers the nation, and it must protected.‚Äù California last week became the first state to sue the federal government over Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff policies, and has argued that the president‚Äôs actions are unlawful and that the constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to impose tariffs.  ‚ÄúNo state is poised to lose more than the state of California,‚Äù Newsom said during a press conference announcing the lawsuit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a serious and sober moment, and I‚Äôd be ‚Ä¶ lying to you if I said it can be quickly undone.‚Äù  California is a major contributor to economic growth nationally, with the money it sends to the federal government outpacing what it receives in federal funding by $83bn, according to a statement from Newsom‚Äôs office.  Despite an enormous shortage of affordable housing that has fueled a homelessness crisis in the state, the population has grown in recent years. Meanwhile, last year the state reported its tourism spending had hit an all-time high ‚Äì though California has seen a drop in some areas.  Canadian tourism in California was down 12% in February compared with the same month last year amid Trump‚Äôs tariff war. In response, the state has announced a new campaign to draw Canadians back, while one city has put up pro-Canada signs across its downtown.",YesNo_Maybe_,2025-04-25T08:41:40,1

"My family was watching an episode of The Studio the other night and they show a background of Hollywood with all the bustle and lights of the city.

Well the tent encampments aren‚Äôt really a joke. Homelessness is a real problem in California . So much Gavin newsom has been dealing with the problem in many ways not all good. Most everything isn‚Äôt. But homelessness and bad housing is.¬†,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T08:36:11,2

"I was in LA a few weeks ago and was eating outside at a restaurant I like in Los Feliz, which is a super cute, walkable neighborhood at the base of Griffith Park.   A group of tourists (who just looked like they watched Fox News) walked by and kept remarking how LA is so much nicer than what they see on the news.",walkallover1991,2025-04-25T08:44:56,3
Homelessness and affordable housing is a real problem in California that goes back decades. It's not a new thing.   But saying that the state is overflowing with tent encampments everywhere is factually incorrect.,walkallover1991,2025-04-25T08:40:33,6
"Homelessness is a real problem everywhere but it's always going to look worse in big cities because there's simply more people overall.    My shitty Fox News watching, hometown doesn't have as many homeless people because they don't have very many people in the first place.  There's only 8,000 people total so they have less of everything.  Based on percentages though its a shit hole.  Like 50% of the population is on some form of government assistance, around 20% are in section 8 housing, a few hundred more in literal shelters and dozens sleeping in parks and streets.    Yet this is the ""bootstraps"" crowd that claims their city is doing things the right way and earning their way through life.  Totally ignorant that if it wasn't for massive redistribution of wealth their city wouldn't even exist.    If LA, NY or Chicago was failing as badly as rural Trump America is, these cities actually would look like what Conservatives see in their imagination.",Fortinbrassy,2025-04-25T09:34:41,3

"I am from CA originally, and just like most places, you can frame it how you want.  Just show footage of Coronado beach in San Diego or ariel shots of highway 101 or show a strip mall in Bakersfield or Riverside. Yeah it's got it's bad area's but if there wasn't way more good than bad, it wouldn't be the most expensive place to live in the country (NYC might be slightly ahead, but still that's a high bar).",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T09:13:35,1
"Incorrect, California and Los Angeles was disgusting when I went there, I saw human feces on the walk of fame, the whole place smelled of pee, there were drug addicted zombies everywhere , needles on the ground, everything there was expensive, I spent my whole life thinking Hollywood was this perfect bustling city but In fact it was the opposite, makeshift tent dwellings everywhere.",Relevant-Tax-2414,2025-04-26T00:08:53,0
