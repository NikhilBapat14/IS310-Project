"While impeachment sounds ominous, it means nothing unless you can get removal.  And to remove, you need 67 Senators to vote that way, which you will not get with Democrats in the way.  Your best solution at this time is to rein in federal district judges to only be able to rule for their district, not nationally.  A similar issue exists in doing this legislatively, so a ruling from SCOTUS could work to resolve this.",mdws1977,2025-04-27T13:54:52,33
The left have been performing a judicial takeover in many countries. I knew of Brazil but there must be more in South America that the global left were trialing this on. This is their way to subvert democracy and the wishes of the people. They always believe the ends justify the means.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T14:48:52,-38

"Sure, but part of making america great is ending the rampant judicial overreach in our country.   We stopped impeaching judges and since then legislating from the bench has exploaded.   Judges arent meant to create laws, but to ensure that our laws are enforced as they were intended to be.",ultrainstict,2025-04-27T15:31:56,25

Unfortunately that is the way. Judiciary just has more power than it should and certainly more power than it used to have. And this must change.,dankhorse25,2025-04-27T16:52:01,-3
Wrong. Which is why democrats upvoted you. If impeachment meant nothing they wouldn't care. In reality it is significant for public opinion and is not something a judge wants to have to go through and have their behavior scrutinized. It def puts them on notice and sends a message. Historically you are also wrong - look no further than the impeachment of Samual Chase who was not convicted yet it had a profound effect on stopping the abuse of judicial power.,day25,2025-04-27T22:05:47,1

"I don’t think you are correct on that, because radical federal district judges are not going to be concerned about public opinion since they can’t be removed.  And the Democrats are in, “Trump is Hitler” mode, so for them anything goes.  Also, comparing a SCOTUS judge from the early 1800s to a district judge today is not going to work.  Especially since Chase remained as a Supreme Court justice until he died.",mdws1977,2025-04-27T23:24:05,9

"Brigaiding is the rule on this sub. And oh they love upvoting comments like ""I didn't vote for this"" and ""This is not democratic"". Let me tell you what is not democratic; The judges doing absolutely nothing to stop a literal invasion and instead doing everything they can to protect the invaders from deportation. Now that is undemocratic.",dankhorse25,2025-04-27T16:54:09,8
"> radical federal district judges are not going to be concerned about public opinion since they can’t be removed  Why do you repeat this non sequitur? It's obviously false. Did you not read anything that I wrote? Did you open up a history book and read about the impeachment of Samuel Chase? Chase remained on the court but the judicial lawfare from him and the lower courts stopped after that! Don't you get it?  Hey I guess you won't mind being investigated by police and charged with a crime as long as you know they can't convict you right? You won't mind having your home raided and all your life looked into and put out in public on the news? You won't mind having to argue your case in court? This is even worse because the judges really are guilty of corruption, even if they were innocent no one wants to go through that. Not to mention these are elitist personality types who pride themselves on all their awards and achievments from authority and you think they won't mind going down in the history books as being a judge that got impeached?  Honestly it's those like you that are the problem with republicans. Dems get in power they don't hesitate to impeach and all polls show it damages perception of republicans. Then when republicans get in power they do nothing and you agree with that? So the public sees one side get impeached, and the other side doesn't what does that say to those who don't follow this in much detail? What message does it send? Well the democrats must not be as bad because republicans (their political opponents) can't even agree they should be impeached!  You completely ignore the real world effects of impeachment. Either you are intentionally trying to sabotage republicans or you are too naive to understand that's what you're doing.",day25,2025-04-28T11:36:33,5
