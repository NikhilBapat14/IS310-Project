He gives 0 fucks about what the constitution says.,twstdbydsn,2025-03-31T10:26:27,37
"Unfortunately the constitution is only as strong as those interpreting it, and the government right now is very weak.",imnota4,2025-03-31T10:26:39,21
"Trump doesn't give a rat's ass about the Constitution. Somebody has to actually stop him this time. Not just make a big bluster about stopping him, actually freaking stop him.",ferriematthew,2025-03-31T10:37:39,10

He'll have to suspend our existing form of government to stay on as President which isn't happening without a huge fight. I dare him to try. The real scary thing here is how many Republicans would willingly destroy the Constitution so Trump can keep power. They're such losers and useful idiots.,atducker,2025-03-31T11:05:53,5
"Look, words on paper do not matter if no one enforces them. Republicans WILL allow him to run in any state that they control. We as Democrats need to get our shit together and head this off by getting state legislators, governors and state secretary of States elected to stop Trump from getting on the ballot.",MARIOpronoucedMA-RJO,2025-03-31T10:34:58,6
SCOTUS aready ruled that he can serve despite the Fourteenth Amendment bar on insurrectionists.  Why should the 22nd apply when the 14th doesnt?,gnurdette,2025-03-31T11:24:09,6

"Holy fuck, is this really the most important issue with his administration right now?  He’s actively dismantling the government and destroying the economy, and we are worried about 2028.",phxees,2025-03-31T19:55:30,1
"More likely he’ll run as VP to Vance.   They win on the promise that it’s a Trump third term, riling up the MAGAts. Then Vance steps down and Trump has his third term.   The real twist is when Vance doesn’t step down, and the corpoaristocricy is cemented.",Epicritical,2025-03-31T20:13:50,1

"I remain convinced that the reason he complained so bitterly and so often about having to push the toilet lever ""10-15 times"" was that the Constitution, being made of parchment, is notoriously difficult to flush.",specqq,2025-03-31T10:57:22,13

"Well, for starters the so called deep blue States control like 43% of the total economy alone. If we simply look at blue vs. red, then it is more like blue States contribute 60%.   I am sure that blue will States will interpret the Constitution well.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T17:36:57,2

"Eh, not really, if he even pretends to stay within the Constitution the US has no mechanism to postpone, delay, or cancel an election except an amendment. Even Lincoln had to run for reelection during the Civil War, even if they did kind of wing it for results from states in the Confederacy by not counting their electoral votes/not holding elections (Tennessee and Louisiana had been recaptured by the Union so held elections, but their electoral votes weren't counted (though ironically, they still voted for Lincoln). It appears that states still part of the Confederacy didn't hold elections, which, duh)",My_useless_alt,2025-03-31T12:42:29,3

"All Military personnel take an oath to the Constitution, not a single person, and are obligated to ignore any order that is illegal or unConstitutional, yes.  But the issue comes down to how, or who, the law or Amendment is being interpreted.    You also got to keep in mind that despite being composed largely by conservative individuals, the Military is not as bonkers right-wing as many seem to think.  In four years under Hegseth, maybe, but as of now not really.   The goodish news if it goes to the Supreme Court, there are a ton of documents alongside the 22nd. Amendment that illustrate the reasoning, logic, and purpose of the Amendment, which is to bar a tyrannical electoral President.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T17:43:13,2
"Well that's the load bearing question right now, I would say.    At what point does the military step away from the President, and what does that look like? Do they just march in and haul him out on Jan 20? Or earlier, if he flat out interferes with election processing? Will some amount of violence be required? All questions we're going to get answers to shortly, I imagine.",littlehobbit1313,2025-03-31T15:24:33,1
