Can we please stop giving this any oxygen? It’s bullshit flood-the-zone nonsense so he can keep the media chasing its tail. FOCUS!

Wow what a strong move threatening Greenland and basically all our allies is; j/k this is the actions of a feeble bully like the biggest football player threatening the kid who can’t play sports because they have a heart condition.

No country has the right to just take over another country so that they can feel more safe. It wasn’t right when Hitler did it. It isn’t right when Putin does it. And it won’t be right when Trump does it. Wrong is WRONG.,495orange,2025-05-04T18:23:28,3

"It’s all so stupid and ridiculous. If Trump wants to “take Greenland by force” all he has to do is land 100 ground troops along with those already at the military base, point their guns and it’s over.  Of course he could just be a friendly ally and reap all the benefits without some showcase of occupation but his narcissistic behavior can’t allow that. He has to roll in with tanks.",Thin_Ad_2046,2025-05-04T18:00:56,1

"Never much says anything clearly. You can just take most answers either way. It's always gonna be great, tremendous, huge, the greatest and most likely fail though.

"He would wage ground war the same way he wages a trade war. First he’d announce it by Tweet, then three different spokesmen would try to explain what he meant, then he’d double-down for 24hr, then when the stock market tanked he would relent and say “it was all deal-making.”  If the Pentagon was smart (ie ignoring Hegseth), they’d spend the intervening time “planning logistics” and “mobilizing resources” and for fucks sake making sure that nobody fired a shot or even had live ammo loaded before the whole thing goes horribly sideways.",mzieg,2025-05-04T18:11:25,3

That's the appeal of his word salad -- it means whatever you want it to.  Point out the incoherent ramblings and non-committal positions to one of his supporters and they really don't see it.  It's like slipping into a daydream of their ideal interpretation.,nerphurp,2025-05-04T18:08:22,4

"Greenland has 50,000 residents and no military. And Denmark isn’t sending any actual troops to help. So yeah the U.S. can take it that easily and hold it that easily. Okay maybe 200 troops if you want to be generous.  Bottom line if Trump wants to ruin alliances and make an enemy of Europe he can do that. Practically he can have  American flags planted all over Greenland he can whenever he wants without military resistance.",Thin_Ad_2046,2025-05-04T18:08:17,-2
It’s a sinister Cabal of all three!,duffman274,2025-05-04T18:14:03,4
Doesn't rule out also means is not saying he won't. Not a single answer is straight forward.   Won't run for a 3rd doesn't mean he won't find a way without running or just refuse to leave.   He talks like an attorney or a cop / investigator. Just leads people to the next step of whatever they want to believe. Refuses to elaborate unless a second open ended answer.,Quiet-Type-,2025-05-04T18:23:37,2

">The allies never left. The GOP is the problem.  Pretty much the sentiment in Europe.  I give the US a lot of sh\*t, but that's just how many western Europeans are. Those WMD in Iraq were a bit crap, and we don't need to talk about Trump 1.0.  But at the same time, I remember doing my voluntary military year in Germany and interacting with a *lot* of Americans stationed over here. Push comes to shove if the US was ever *really* attacked, I wouldn't hesitate to take a bullet for them.  If you wanted to change NATO spending, all you had to do was walk the fuck in and say: ""we need to focus on the Pacific. Can you spend like 1% more on defense per country so we can do that? Here's a plan over 2-3 years how to do it well."" And we'd be fine. I'd be the first one to vote for that shit.  Trump and his GOP sycophants are the issue.",BCMakoto,2025-05-04T21:36:38,3
"Hold up.  Greenland is under rule of Denmark that is a NATO country. If the USA attacks Greenland, it triggers Article 5 for NATO allies and then possibly WW3.  All for NOTHING!",Late-Ladder-6944,2025-05-04T18:35:01,6
"Way more. There's a short window to stall it   We'd setup full Patriot batteries, that's several hundred people.  We'd probably use a carrier strike group for intercepts and Aegis coverage.  Eastern side of Greenland needs coverage to prevent European shenanigans.   Western side needs coverage to prevent Canadian shenanigans.   Yeah, it'd be thousands... and completely stupid with no commercial viability given the constant threat of missile strikes.  Honestly, the only reason you'd bother with all this is probably to cut Europe off from running supplies to Canada if we lose our minds.",nerphurp,2025-05-04T18:31:20,2

"Article 5 of NATO states that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. If a NATO member is attacked, all other members will come to its aid, potentially including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain security.  Denmark is part of NATO.   I think when the treaty was written, there was never any provision given for one NATO country attacking another, yet here we are, the United States is the first ever to threaten another NATO country.",Late-Ladder-6944,2025-05-04T19:34:45,2
