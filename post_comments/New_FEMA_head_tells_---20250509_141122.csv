If my boss said that to me I would just not do anything at work.  Wouldn’t want to get in his way.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-09T14:13:29,54
I bet he will be the best boss they ever had. People love to work for a dictatorial piece of shit.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-09T14:13:35,26
He looks exactly like a POS that could say something like that.,uhohnotafarteither,2025-05-09T14:17:23,28
Great leadership there. No way this doesn’t end with him committing a crime or three.,giga_phantom,2025-05-09T14:14:28,19

"""""We're going to find out how to push things down to the states,"" the acting leader later added. ""That should be done at the state level. "" Can't wait for the first hurricane to destroy Florida. To all Democrats living in the Southern States - Be prepared to evacuate to a safe State.",trublueprogressive,2025-05-09T14:45:56,6
"""I, and I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA,"" Richardson said.”  “Toward the end of his remarks, the acting FEMA head referred all staff to two memos he authored in recent weeks, and distributed Friday morning. ""They're very short, but they will require almost all of you in this room input to some degree or another,"" Richardson said.”  I love the contradictions in this one 17 minute speech. “I don’t give a fuck what you think, get out of my way… also please fill out the employee surveys I’m handing out because your input matters and I want to make sure we all enjoy Taco Tuesdays.”",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-09T17:41:47,5
Sounds like a challenge to me.,ctguy54,2025-05-09T14:24:08,3
">I can't recall the full title, but essentially, I'm acting,"" Richardson told staff on Friday, ""I don't need the full title. All I need is the authority from the president to put me in here as some degree of acting and I will make sure that his intent gets completed. I don't stop at yield signs,"" he continued.   Frankly, to me he sounds like an excellent pic for the job of gutting, dismantling and shuttering FEMA.  Seems like a weird thing to do imho, but oh well.   Best of luck to you, Florida (and other states that will be devastated regularly by climate change).",sniffstink1,2025-05-09T14:49:32,4

"I'm gonna run right over you as I accomplish my task to do absolutely nothing for fema and those devastated by natural disasters.

I can’t believe I am siding with trump and this asshole. I am all for dismantling FEMA. I think it should be regional. I want New England to stop sending a portion of taxes it sends to the feds and let us manage our own NE EMA.  The southern states can take care of their own.

What is this fetish that Redditors have with general strikes?    General strikes are only successful in countries that are highly unionized because it is the unions that organized the strikes and provide the support necessary for people who live hand to mouth to be able to take a week or more off of work.   Talking about general strikes in the United States is like talking about a ski industry in Florida. The right conditions do not exist.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T16:08:59,3

"NY sends more aid to the south than they take.  They will use the money they sent to south on their own people.  The mid-Atlantic states are rich.  New England responds great to any kind of crisis.  We are great that way.  We are kind, not fake nice like those southerners.  We actually take care of our people.    If I were you, I would complain to trump.

"Man, you’re misguided on this. Do you realize the resources you _don’t_ have in a little area like New England if it gets destroyed by one giant hurricane?   But it’s cool, you’ll pump out the floodwater and use all the destroyed supplies to rebuild…  Or, you know, you could use the full might of the federal system and bring supplies that are nice and dry…",jspurlin03,2025-05-09T19:27:24,5
"If you gave it some thought you would realize that it's not a matter of just having the money in aggregate. It's a question of warehousing and having the personnel and processes in place to transport and deploy those supplies.   Generally, those people and supplies have to come from outside of the area where the disaster occurred because, surprisingly, the area under the disaster declaration isn't in any position to deal with it.  EDIT:  oh yes. The Northeasterners are renowned for their friendly, welcoming personalities and compassionate and charitable activities. ROFL  I mean, you seem like the perfect example.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-09T19:21:04,3
