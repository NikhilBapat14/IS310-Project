"Sometimes I think about how we got here. Roughly a football stadiums number of votes across three states on one night in 2016, fully opening Pandora's box to the absolute wildest, strangest and most disgusting cult-like adoration that I would have never thought possible a decade ago.   That night goes another way and you're looking at a 5-4 or 6-3 liberal Supreme Court majority, 12 consecutive years of Democratic executive power at minimum, and most importantly, a Republican Party that while would still be disagreeable on policy would not have descended into embarrassing themselves regularly on behalf of the literal Antichrist.   Like, 2017 was bad yeah, but because of him alone. The VP, the cabinet, shit even the Paul Ryan led House of Reps had somewhat maintained a level of sanity that is just completely absent from today's GOP.",cpatkyanks24,2025-05-03T22:47:10,15
Any picture of 46.999999999 is revolting but choosing the picture of the false flag operation where they murdered two people is reprehensible and tells you everything you need to know about the owner of this Wank-Panzer.,statmonkey2360,2025-05-03T23:23:15,8
I remember when that happened. I had coworkers saying “they shot our president!” As if he is some great leader and not the destroyer of our country.,Johnqpublic25,2025-05-04T06:30:58,5

"_Pushes up glasses._  Ah yes, aposematic coloration, an honest warning signal. However, it’s worth considering if this is actually Bayesian mimicry. They may be engaging in bluffing, a deimatic display, when in reality they’re otherwise defenseless. Which is very possible with anyone in a Cybertruck.",StringOfLights,2025-05-04T16:18:54,1

"That’s not necessary how things would have been had Hillary won. Trump would have ran again in 2020, ramped up the rhetoric and conspiracies all the same.   If Trump had lost in 2024, he probably would have ran again in 2028. Who’s to say he would turn down raising 100s of millions for campaigning just because he lost twice.   The Christians needed a new story. The bible is old news. That group was primed for a cult leader. Russian disinformation was growing, now powered be ai. I think it’s typically a waste of time to say what would have happened in completely hypothetical scenarios. There’s no way to know. This country was supposed to somehow come to its senses after 2016?  No way!",clocksteadytickin,2025-05-04T02:16:12,1
"No, totally.   I think Musk and him get along so well because at the end of the day phenomenal PR/showman is all they really are.    And conmen, but you gotta have some pizazz to pull off the biggest cons.",parenthetical_phrase,2025-05-03T23:28:41,4

"Here’s the thing - they really aren’t. Tesla sales are STILL even now primarily from left leaning coastal areas. Just not cybertrucks, but they barely sell Cybertrucks to begin with and I seriously doubt the one in the picture above was purchased to be a daily driver. Just purchased to send out pictures like this to anger liberals.   The cruelty and trolling is the whole point of this admin.",cpatkyanks24,2025-05-04T09:17:17,3
"This could be accurate. I feel like there would have been a wholesale rejection of Trump if he gets defeated in a presidential election by an extremely unpopular Democratic candidate after running the most racist, divisive campaign in modern history and three weeks after Pussygate was released. This would’ve been Republicans third consecutive general election loss. That’s a big deal, nobody likes losers.   Maybe you’re right, but I much prefer the timeline of winning in 2016 and cutting this thing off at the head than the one where we defeat him in 2020 because the thought that he was some kind of unbreakable messiah was by that point built into the psyche of 40% of the population and made his comeback even remotely possible.  We probably would’ve lost in 2020 after Covid to a generic Republican vs Clinton, but I believe (or would like to believe) it wouldn’t have been Trump.",cpatkyanks24,2025-05-04T09:21:07,1
Yep. Both come from rich backgrounds who on the surface did really impressive things but if you talk to them about the intricacies about how any of their businesses work they will not have a damn clue.   Musk is a moron. Tesla and SpaceX succeeded because of extremely talented engineers and designers whose names we will never know because he took the credit. Trump answers every question like a 7th grader on a book he didn’t read. They’re perfect for each other.,cpatkyanks24,2025-05-04T09:24:11,2

Well everyone experiencing at least a modicum of intelligence and decency wants a different president. It’s time to stop wondering what could have been and face reality. Donald fucking dumbass Trump is going to be president for the next 45 months. At least.,clocksteadytickin,2025-05-04T10:00:02,1
"The only impressive thing that Musk ever did, was he hit the genetic lottery by being born into obscene wealth, buying already existing companies, and slapping his ""brand"" on it.

"Even after he's gone, the stench of Trump will likely linger for decades or longer, sort of how the odor of burnt microwave popcorn lingers. He has totally destroyed the U.S. Government, so much that it can no longer be trusted to ever do the right thing and is now something to be feared.",LivingIndependence,2025-05-04T10:38:33,2
