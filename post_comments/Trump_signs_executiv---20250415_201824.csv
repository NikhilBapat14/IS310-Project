Why not sign an executive order letting Medicare negotiate prices? That would actually lower prices.,DS_9,2025-04-16T02:32:09,467
More dumb EOs  Why not help draft up some actual legislation?  Edit:  If you think the President is not involved in drafting up a bill he intends to sign you have no place in this discussion.,sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-16T08:01:52,221

Big pharma scares me because you can't really fuck with them as we really need them. We need newer better life saving drugs but if we fuck with their bottom line they won't invest as much into the research. Really what is the solution?,Hectoriu,2025-04-16T03:46:15,-13

"You're a self-styled constitutional conservative and you don't realize that responsibility for drafting legislation falls on the legislature, not the executive?",Shadeylark,2025-04-16T11:53:30,12
"Because he's the president and can't draft legislation. And every single bill that goes through the process takes forever (if it even makes it to the end that is), requires limited political capital, and is liable to be filled with pork.   EO's are quick, clean, and easy. Which is why every president since Bush (but especially since Obama) has taken advantage of it. The downside is they aren't permanent.   Theoretically I am fully behind removing executive orders since they circumvent our checks and balances. But the cat is out of the bag and it wouldn't make any political sense to stop or even slow down on the EOs",john_the_fisherman,2025-04-16T09:36:14,17

You think congress when drafting legislation never talks to the president?  DUDE.  Perhaps its you who doesn't understand how things work in DC.,sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-16T14:01:54,6

"Yea, my critique of Trump is more...spent less time drafting EOs and more time kicking congress's butt to get some major legislation passed that'll actually do some good for the people.  Tariffs are a tax on US, a tax that we are now seeing in real time.  Without being backed by tax cuts and deregulation we'll only see stagflation and get DESTROYED in the mid-terms and likely in 2028 as well.",sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-16T10:57:41,18
