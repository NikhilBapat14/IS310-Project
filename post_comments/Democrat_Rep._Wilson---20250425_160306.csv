"For those who don't want to waste time reading this slop, she told people to threaten lawmakers with protests and constant office calls. A nothingburger.   Besides the obvious biased headline, other ways you know to disregard the article is when Democrat is used as an adjective and when the ""source"" is Foxnews. When a media company's main faces are openly racist pieces pieces of shit, this is what gets churned out.",papibigdaddy,2025-04-25T16:12:00,13

"That’s great, but you accused someone of it when all they did was respond, so your understanding of it seems pretty shaky.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:15:47,2
You want to arrest people for being “traitors” based on disagreeing with them.  Classic fascist.,Brokkyn2024,2025-04-25T18:29:39,3
Knowing how terrible it is is shaky?,Reddit_LikesGroomers,2025-04-25T18:17:12,2
Not what I said. Your understanding of communism itself is shaky if you’re accusing someone of being a communist simply for responding to you.,ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:17:59,3

"Simply responding to you with what they said doesn’t make them a communist.  And throughout this whole thing, all you’ve managed to say in response is basically “communism bad. He communist because he disagreed with me.”",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:20:55,2

"It absolutely is not. By any measurement. If that’s the extent to your understanding of communism (including using a childish word like “commie”), maybe do a bit more studying on the subject.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:23:30,3

"Again, just because someone calls someone a fascist, that doesn’t make them a communist.   It sounds like you don’t have the first idea what communism actually is.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:25:26,3
"""Again, just because someone calls someone a fascist, that doesn’t make them a communist.""  Correct, but all wannabe commies on reddit call people that word to try to win arguments they're losing.",Reddit_LikesGroomers,2025-04-25T18:27:31,1
That doesn’t make them a communist. You literally just said they’re a communist citing no other evidence than using the term fascist.,ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:28:20,3

"No, it isn’t. It isn’t even in the description. You obviously don’t understand any of the words you use and just throw “communist” and “commie” out as insults.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-25T18:30:19,2
