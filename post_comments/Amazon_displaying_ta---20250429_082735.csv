A tariff is a _tax._  It's not exactly unusual to show the tax breakout on a receipt.,mzieg,2025-04-29T08:32:35,122

"If the White House had any coherent policy, they would actually celebrate this. Amazon could promote products with little to no tariffs as they would be sourced from inside the USA. Isn't that the purpose of the tariffs anyway, to incentivize people to buy American?",Flash_Fiction,2025-04-29T08:40:50,52
"> ""Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?"" Leavitt questioned.

They also need to make clear that it's a Trump tariff (in case dumb MAGAs assume the tariffs they're having to pay were imposed by China or wherever).,KE55,2025-04-29T08:52:31,3
Trump never realized that most of the tech bros didn't really like him. They just played along to get the benefits and waited for Trump to slide. Now it's time for Trump to be on the receiving end.   9,rapidcreek409,2025-04-29T09:05:59,3
"A company being transparent and being called hostile is as hyperbolic as saying using the wrong pronoun is violence.  Also, Karoline Leavitt is a freakin moron.

">. Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?"" Leavitt questioned.  If Amazon did show how much inflation raised the price and what caused it it would not be the reason Trump admin morons like Leavitt want it to be.  And doing so would never be able to reduce the inflation like showing what the ""temporarily"" tariffs institututed by one man alone are doing. They are just mad because it makes their claims that  ""the seller is paying for all this"" sound even more silly.",aijoe,2025-04-29T09:05:40,2
When idiotic „politicians“ don’t understand the difference between taxes (including tariffs) and inflation. The US government really is fucked and the people along with it because one third voted for it and another third didn’t vote at all because „tHeY aRe ThE sAmE… and equally bad!“. 🤦‍♂️  Insane.,LovesFrenchLove_More,2025-04-29T09:21:48,2
I work for a food importer. Most of our buyers are explicitly INSISTING that we make tariffs a line item on our invoices for their own financing purposes. Wtf.,GivinUpTheFight,2025-04-29T09:34:00,2
Probably take to the end of business today before Bezo drops it.,Mediocre_Presence839,2025-04-29T09:40:59,2
"So when do we get an executive order attacking Amazon? Tomorrow? Friday?  I mean at least this shows they're concerned about public opinion on the tariffs. Meaning the American people apparently have some leverage still. Might change when yesterday's order goes into effect though. Strengthening the police state is a very head on approach at stomping out protests. So clearly the Trump administration is concerned enough to take proactive steps to maintain control.  Still, we should never be in this position in the United States. What was that about taxation,  representation  and tea parties?",pontiacfirebird92,2025-04-29T10:06:55,2

Literally what almost every single receipt I've ever had does. At least in the United States that is always been common practice.,Deinosoar,2025-04-29T08:39:12,29
But they don't want you to know you're paying this tax.,CockBrother,2025-04-29T08:46:53,29
Don't know about the US per-se. But in almost all countries that is required *by law* and not doing so is a felony. Amazon is not stupid and does not make 197 different checkout pages. I would be very surprized if it is not the same in the US anyway.,kaas-schaaf,2025-04-29T08:55:45,13
"And Amazon has greater responsibility to we consumers who pay the money, than it does to the White House.  Amazon is NOT a nationalized company of Cheeto's federal government.",timnphilly,2025-04-29T09:50:39,3
Even then it's still sort of a political statement.  Like the business owner has to point out to the customer that the pesky Government has their hands in everbody's pockets.   In most of Europe I think the customers know that the business has to pay it's bill's and don't need to have a breakdown of SOME of it's expenses so they just give a single amount without tacking on senseless fees and taxes.,Goose1963,2025-04-29T09:07:33,0

Amazon have told the BBC they had no intention of showing tariffs in their pricing.  Amazon Haul considered it but no decision was ultimately made.

">These corporations have far too much power, not even trumpy boy himself can curb that.  That's usually how it is in the beginning though. Dictators are usually propped up by institutions who are far more wealthy and powerful than themselves. Over time the dictator removes any checks and balances and consolidates more and more power until eventually, those institutions lose control of him. That's what happened with Putin and the Russian Oligarchs. Also decades before with the German industrialists who supported Hitler.  I do agree that something is different this time, and might prevent Trump from reaching that point though. It's that he really isn't a schemer and is pretty damn incompetent. He might pull something that causes corporations to cut their losses with him and back someone else. But I guess we'll see what happens.",kingofcrosses,2025-04-29T09:33:18,2
