"He's openly destroying the state apparatus. As with everything else he destroys (economy, alliances, international reputation) the damage is permanent. Here, Trump is not just closing down agencies, he's making employment in public service longterm unwanted and unappealing.    But that's part of the plan. Irreparable destruction of the government. As with everything else, Trump crosses these thresholds that ensure his way forward is now the only way forward. ",Goodk4t,2025-04-27T04:23:47,73
"Chaos - fired then rehired then fired again  So what happened to their health insurance?  >HSU: Well, that is the million-dollar question. You know, the federal government, like any big employer, has policies about benefits. And when these Commerce Department employees were first fired, many of them were told that their health insurance would end 31 days after their last pay period. That would have been April 8. But the confusion began when they were reinstated.  >SIMON: HR couldn't answer that?  >HSU: No. You know, a lot of them have heard nothing. And for some, it was a pressing question. I spoke with Ya'el Seid-Green back in January. She had scheduled arthroscopic hip surgery for April 9...  >Ya'el Seid-Green and other Commerce Department employees were getting a new memo from the government telling them their insurance had lapsed on April 8, per that original termination date....  >I did speak with an outside expert on federal employee benefits. And she said, you know, we've never had a situation where people have been fired, rehired and fired again, so this is all unknown territory.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T03:29:05,21
Imagine healthcare which should be a human right is being tied to an employer. America the free smh.,m_a_r_c_h_,2025-04-27T08:44:44,12
My 80+ grandfather was without insurance for over a month as a retired postal worker. It was a hot mess and he had to pay thousands out of pocket to keep up with his health during that period.,kailsbabbydaddy,2025-04-27T11:50:12,5
Federal employees should go on strike. I know it may be illegal for some of them to do it but they should anyway. And unjust law should not be a law and if the majority of federal workers went on strike then Congress would either have to change the laws or shut everything down.,digiorno,2025-04-27T07:41:30,2
"When I write to my Republican legislators about the destruction of government agencies, they have the balls to tell me it's all about saving money. Lol.  How stupid do they think we are?",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T04:48:26,34

"Yes, it's called COBRA insurance. The gap you get from your employer when they are no longer paying their share. Think of all the small businesses we could unleash if we didn't have insurance by employer hanging over our heads.   Shameful. We could have gone with a Public Option or Medicare for all - thank the Republicans and Joe Lieberman - who was bought by the insurance companies.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T13:30:30,2
"That’s not an option. For 1, most aren’t in a union that has ability to strike. 2) Reagan got away when firing Union air traffic control employees setting a precedent calling it a strategic resource or something. 3), civil servants can simply be fired if they strike which I think is what the Heritage Foundation and Trump want.",FastAsLightning747,2025-04-27T07:59:57,9
"In other industrialized countries this is possible - they have social services and protections and affordable health care and unions.  Not so in the US.  If you stay home from work to strike, you are fkd.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T09:17:22,3
"Yeah. I’ve been hearing a little from the inside. The government has been hiring contractors to fill in the gaps from the people they’ve fired. The contractors have a higher salary than the government employees and—get this—can still work from home.  It’s not about saving money. It’s a regime change. They’re doing a poor job of hiding it, and I pray to god people will wake up and demand receipts.",Entropy_Pyre,2025-04-27T08:49:42,23

"They’re not in a position to be complacent. They are slowly losing their benefits, their labor rights and their retirements.   Striking is one of the only options they have left.   Raegan shouldn’t have gotten away with what he did and it’s long over due for federal workers to take back their ability to collectively bargain and protest.",digiorno,2025-04-27T08:13:07,6
Exactly - this will cost more.   And when they sell the government off to private parties - well they expect to make a profit. So services will be cut and prices will go up. We will pay more for less.   Got a package you want to send from bum fk no where  Alabama to a village in Alaska?  Good luck with that. Need a library or a public school in a small rural community? No way.,SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T09:24:48,8
