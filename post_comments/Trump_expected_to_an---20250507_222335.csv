"> Timothy C. Brightbill, an international trade attorney at Wiley Rein, told the New York Times that the announcement would probably be “just an agreement to start the negotiations, identifying a framework of issues to be discussed in the coming months.”  So it’s literally a concept of a deal.",Gustapher00,2025-05-07T22:30:43,32

More bullshit from the sleazy snake oil salesman.   This is from 2020: Trump boasted U.S.-U.K. trade deal would be ‘fantastic and big.’ Boosters may be disappointed.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/us-uk-trade-deal-trump-boasted-would-be-fantastic-and-big-boosters-may-be-dissappointed/2020/03/02/0d8577c2-5c90-11ea-ac50-18701e14e06d_story.html,Ozymandias12,2025-05-07T23:07:20,3

"the irony is that Britain has been desperate for a trade agreement with the US (with every country really) for 8 years and not even their biggest bestest ally gave it one, until now, because that's what happens when you isolate yourself from the world: everyone will sense your desperation and abuse their position to get advantages they wouldn't get otherwise. that's what happened to the UK when they left the EU, suddenly they had no trade agreements with anyone, because everything went through the EU and they were now back to zero. it was like a nation with almost 1000 years of existence had been founded yesterday. ironically Trump did the exact same thing to the US by ripping off every trade agreement they had ever made in one day he ironically called ""Liberation Day"". now they'll only be able to sign deals with equally desperate countries like the UK. everyone else can just trade with each other as if the US doesn't exist and squeeze an increasingly desperate US. we won't see proper trade agreements before a decade passes, same as the post-Brexit UK.  Trump might bring back manufacturing in a few decades but he put the US in a really tough place to achieve it.",Glass-Plankton5218,2025-05-07T22:45:13,11
