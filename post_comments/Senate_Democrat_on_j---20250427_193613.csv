Still waiting for the cowards in congress that call themselves “Republicans” to do their damn job and impeach this illegitimate president.,Heteroimpersonator,2025-04-27T19:45:11,96
"When you know that Tom Homan is likely to shuttle people to the CECOT torture center regardless of whether they committed any crime (no being here seeking asylum is NOT a crime), it kind of puts you in a moral quandary if you took on a legal career to try to do justice.  I won't be surprised by more arrests of this kind.  It's going to be tough in this particular arrest to prove intent, though.  The defense could easily be just an oversight, especially if the prosecutors have no evidence of what the judge knew and when she knew it.",deltalitprof,2025-04-27T19:57:49,15

This really isn’t the hill to die on for democrats. Her alleged actions could be illegal. Sensationalizing this case is disingenuous and distracts from the actual fascistic actions Trump and his regime are taking.,hamburglar10101010,2025-04-28T03:44:29,-1

"Can't ignore the dem's that voted with Republicans also-  >On the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Schumer said that new Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., “has said he wants to make the Senate a place where all members should have a chance to make their voices heard. This bill would be a fine place to start.”  >Newly in the minority, Democrats voted with Republicans on Thursday to advance legislation that would require federal authorities to detain unauthorized immigrants who have been accused of certain crimes — signaling that they will try and find spots to work with President-elect Donald Trump while simultaneously trying to block much of his  https://apnews.com/article/senate-laken-riley-immigration-schumer-thune-af98bb565d6cf7530c4e702ed3f8aab1  Edit: Schumer voted for the illegal deportations.

"Impeach for what. Which charge is going to stick directly to Trump? If a insurrection couldn't do it, these tariffs and deportations and executive orders are getting thrown left and right by judges. He didn't arrest the Wisconsin judge himself. Supreme Court said he has immunity and the definition of facilitate is bare minimum to show in court.   So on what basis are you impeaching Trump? Or is this another political theatre that will do jack all cause it won't get confirmed in the senate, because there is nothing concrete to stick to. Dems should abandon this impeach gaff",Immediate_Concert_46,2025-04-28T00:30:37,-12
"Literally what do you want them to do. They dont have control of the house or senate, they can't even introduce legislation without Johnson's say so to schedule it in the house.
