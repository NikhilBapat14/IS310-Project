Iirc Russia was trying to deny it was directly opposing US forces in the region at the time. They wanted to help prop up the Syrian government but wanted to maintain the illusion that Russia wasn't using its own forces.  Financial backing is entirely different than boots on the ground.  Also propaganda for back home as to how many resources Russian govt was dedicating to this.  The radio transcript is kind of horrifically hilarious in how coalition forces shut down the attack.  https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-leaked-audio-humiliating-defeat-by-us-forces-2018-2,korinth86,2023-02-24T17:35:38,5
"Do you mean during the battle or in the official remarks afterwards?  Russian Ministry of Defence might genuinely not have known that Wagner were there. Although Wagner are sometimes portrayed as an arm of the Russian state, they also have their own financial interests and goals that sometimes contradict or conflict with the actual government's. Russia also had an agreement with the US about how many pro-regime forces could be in the area, as part of a 'de-confliction' line, and may not have wanted to appear that they were intentionally jeopardising it.   As for the actual battle, it's not apparent that hundreds of Russian security contractors were actually killed in battle with the US; [Spiegel reporting](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/american-fury-the-truth-about-the-russian-deaths-in-syria-a-1196074.html) suggests that the Russians were in a support role for a militia attempting to take the oil fields, and collateral damage when retaliatory airstrikes hit, and that it was dozens not hundreds of casualties. It was fighters of other nationalities that were killed in the actual battle.   At any rate, whether they were killed in the rear or in actual combat with Americans, it is not in the Kremlin's interest (or self-perceived interest) to acknowledge embarrassing combat loses. The Kremlin is habitually dishonest when it comes to 'special military operations' of all kinds.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-02-26T09:15:56,2
"Why do the Chinese lie about what they're doing to their muslim populations?  Same reason politicians lie about them not having said X or never ever supporting X. It gives the illusion of deniability.  Here's a good example, remember when Ted Cruz left Texas in the middle of a hurricane to go to Mexico? He said he was just dropping his daughter off in Mexico, but he was lying. His return flight wasn't for a week or so, but he lied and said he was always planning to head straight back.  If he had said ""Yes, I was planning on taking a vacation during the hurricane,"" that certainly would have had more severe repercussions for his career than just lying until the accusations died down. Now everyone's forgotten about it.",yaya-pops,2023-02-24T18:12:20,0
What I never understand about that is Ted Cruz dosen't work for the state government he's a United States Senator if the governor left the state in the middle of the crisis that would be one thing but it's not in any way abandoning his job by leaving Texas because his job is literally in Washington DC it feels like everyone was just pouncing on him because of the bad Optics it generated but Ted Cruz's presence in Texas during the crisis would not have made any meaningful difference for those who were suffering if anything he should have left Texas and gone to Washington to leverage his office to ask the federal government for more aid but even that could be conceivably done over the phone so why not take a vacation at that point?,LordJesterTheFree,2023-02-25T07:29:20,1
