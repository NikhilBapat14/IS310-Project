You hear that Supreme Court??? The world is watching! Do something!,No-Group-4504,2025-04-30T07:19:24,92
Defying the Supreme Court and no one will do anything. Guess all that American constitution  bravado was all bullshit,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-30T07:38:47,26

"I mean, the LAW said to bring Abrego back. Trump swore to uphold the law. Impeach.",photobriangray,2025-04-30T07:31:27,22
"how is this still a thing, the Supreme Court told them to bring him back, albeit in a mealymouthed fashion. the lower court then again said bring him back, and did so with all due respect for the Executive, as commanded by the Supreme Court. Yet he's still not here.  First they came for the tattooed...  Due process for everyone, or, as trump believes, due process for no one.",corrector300,2025-04-30T07:31:27,17
Sounds like the Supreme Court needs to hold the administration in contempt.,Browns45750,2025-04-30T08:04:41,12
What the actual fuck is happening? Has he refused a Supreme Court order for weeks now? The whole system is a joke and crumbling because of an old man with dementia and makeup on.,75International,2025-04-30T08:36:18,8
So country over then?   We the people donâ€™t answer to kings.  PA state is my federal govt now,lazydivey98,2025-04-30T08:19:10,5
He is just an a-hole!,HeHateMe337,2025-04-30T07:28:46,5
Violates his oath of office to uphold the constitution.   Impeachment can't reach the floor of Congress due to Political party-line  interference.  The interference at the congressional level is also a violation of their oath of office?,RobbyRock75,2025-04-30T09:06:16,3
Of course he won't. It's his test case to see how much he can get away with.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T08:19:12,3
Openly admitting that heâ€™s defying direct court orders including the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling ! But surly the SC will hold him in contemptâ€¦.. NOPE ! Heâ€™ll get away with it,CAM6913,2025-04-30T09:15:54,3
This is an admission that he is willfully and defiantly violating a Supreme Court order.,nwgdad,2025-04-30T08:44:49,2
And so needs to be removed from office forthwith.,halberthawkins,2025-04-30T09:49:11,2
So then we are in a constitutional crisis since heâ€™s defied SCOTUS.  He needs to be impeached right now. Have the GOP declare in public how this isnâ€™t an impeachable offense before 2026.,yorapissa,2025-04-30T10:27:23,2
Then he has openly admitted to violating his oath of office.,Lykeuhfox,2025-04-30T10:43:25,2

"If Republicans stand in the way of him being impeached and removed, they're saying we now have a king and the supreme court might as well not even exist anymore. There's really nothing more un-American than that.",Angedelanuit97,2025-04-30T08:06:29,3
I donâ€™t think Donald knows how to bring the guy back. Heâ€™s hiding behind his fake persona.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-30T07:48:41,1
This is nothing less than evil.,UK_Tiger,2025-04-30T07:53:00,1
Doesn't sound very facilitating.,Cant_Win,2025-04-30T09:05:09,1
When are you going to El Salvador? Youâ€™re a convicted criminal.,Solzeluver,2025-04-30T09:05:13,1
"Yeah, we could stick him in there for a third term, but we wonâ€™t.",Mr_Thx,2025-04-30T09:34:30,1
Makes you wonder if heâ€™s saying this because he actually canâ€™tÂ ,StoneCypher,2025-04-30T09:41:20,1
"Key word is ""won't""",BrainySmurf,2025-04-30T09:47:28,1
Weâ€™ve known that. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re pissed.,honeybee2288,2025-04-30T10:58:58,1
He should have been arrested a long time ago.,Rebel_hooligan,2025-04-30T13:17:46,1
Well. Apparently only the US Marshals can do anything about it and they report to Pam bondi,Died_Of_Dysentery1,2025-04-30T13:18:58,1

I think it's congress who has the next move. the only question I see is whether or not they see defying the SC when you admittedly have the power to comply as an impeachable offense? my guess is the R side of congress will say no.,JamieGawain,2025-04-30T07:28:26,25
Supreme Court : meh! He will come for us last.,Successful-Sand686,2025-04-30T13:02:08,3
Like Thomas and his buddies would allow that.Â ,fairoaks2,2025-04-30T08:19:05,3
"All he has to do is ask.  He has never even done that, at least not with any sincerity.  The guy postures himself as the best negotiator to ever live and he can't even negotiate the return of one person that his own admin sent overseas?  This is all a game.   Bukele of El Salvador alleges that he can't send Garcia back because he's not going to sneak a person into the country with the US's permission (he actually said he can't smuggle in a terrorist).  The Trump admin then claims that they can't get him back because El Salvador won't release him.  This is talking in circles and pushing the blame back on one another so that it can't really fall on either of them.  This is all planned bullshit.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-30T09:30:56,2
