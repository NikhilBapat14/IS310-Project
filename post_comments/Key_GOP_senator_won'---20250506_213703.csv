North Carolina is definitely one of the seats Dems have a good chance of picking up if Trump's approvals continue to decline...  So make of that what you will.,Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-06T21:51:09,18
"Snippet:   >WASHINGTON — Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wouldn't support Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's [nominee for U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-pick-key-prosecutor-post-dodges-senate-questions-jan-6-criticism-rcna203496), most likely blocking the path to confirmation for the “Stop the Steal” organizer who had closely aligned himself with Jan. 6 defendants.  >“I’ve indicated to the White House I wouldn’t support his nomination,” Tillis said Tuesday after meeting with Martin on Monday night.  >Tillis is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is overseeing Martin's nomination. The panel has 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats, meaning if all other members aside from Tillis voted along party lines, the vote on Martin would end in a tie and his nomination would not be reported favorably to the full Senate.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-06T21:37:44,11
"Unexpected, but thank God. Martin is a terrible person. The damage he planned for DC was a nightmare.",Building_a_life,2025-05-06T22:24:31,9
Tillis finally did a thing. It won’t be nearly enough.,lionofyhwh,2025-05-06T22:13:54,5
I'll believe it when I see it. Tillis said the same thing about previous nominations and ended up approving when the vote occurred.,ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-07T01:47:54,4
"Good! Now James Boasberg can appoint a moderate, end Ed Martin’s reign of terror.",Capable-Ad8541,2025-05-07T02:51:17,3
I love when republicans find their balls for one second. Hopefully he still has his balls when it’s time to vote.,verisimilitu,2025-05-07T07:30:06,3

When Thom Tillis thinks you’re terrible…just yikes!,Zolomun,2025-05-07T07:27:11,5
"Regardless of how you feel about him I should stress that it's very important that we encourage this kind of behavior and North Carolina constituents need to be calling his office and thanking him for this and encouraging him to remain firm. Even if you have to pretend you will support him in 2026 just do whatever it takes to convince whoever answers the phone that your support is riding on him standing up to Dump.  Because I can tell you right now from what I'm reading on Steve bannon's Twitter and all the other activists and influencers in the magatsphere, the maga base is going absolutely crazy right now over this so we don't want the only calls they're getting are thousands of day from angry MAGAts threatening him and his family.  Because they are definitely calling and they are very loud and very angry and hostile. So there need's to be a lot of communication coming from the non insane people letting him know you have his back.",Hillary4SupremeRuler,2025-05-08T14:16:59,2
I highly doubt he will. Why would he make a public statement like this and then do a 360?,Capable-Ad8541,2025-05-07T02:53:20,5
Roy Cooper should be in the Democratic ticket in 28.,CanvasFanatic,2025-05-06T22:26:01,2
He doesn’t give a shit about this man’s character.   He cares about his chances of keeping his seat in what’s expected to be a highly contested election in ‘26.   If he keeps approving these idiots and they keep publicly proving their buffoons (see: Hegseth) his support in NC will crater.,Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-07T12:09:19,2
"Because he's a republican going against the will of their god-king?  The GOP opposition to Trump has been performative, not substantiative.   It only appears when it doesn't really matter, not for anything important.  Until he actually casts a vote against Martin that actually derails his nomination, it doesn't matter what he says.",banner650,2025-05-07T03:06:25,2
"Have you not paid attention to all the other nominations? They always say they won’t support them, only to fold like a cheap lawn chair every time. I don’t see that changing.",Shadow293,2025-05-07T06:50:47,2
Like I [said in a previous comment ](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/1qEZK8QWjd) it's very important to call Tillis's office and support him on this.,Hillary4SupremeRuler,2025-05-08T14:18:36,1
"Having control of the Senate is just as important as the white house, plus Cooper will be like 70 in 2028.  It's the same reason AOC taking Schumer's seat is probably better than running for POTUS as a House Rep.",CrashB111,2025-05-06T22:47:39,7
"Nah, there’s a pretty deep 28 bench to pick from, if he wants national politics he needs to keep going, win this senate seat and go from there. Trying to be overly clever and demanding never goes well.",Blue_winged_yoshi,2025-05-07T02:45:58,2
"Plus AOC will be 38 in 2028. It's old enough constitutionally to be president, but I'd be uncomfortable voting a person into that role who doesn't have a little more life experience than that regardless of how I feel about their political stances.",Dispro,2025-05-07T08:59:30,1
