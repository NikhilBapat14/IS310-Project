"From NPR and NBC:  https://www.npr.org/2023/06/02/1179633624/snap-food-assistance-work-requirements-congress-debt-ceiling  https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-work-requirements-food-benefits-snap-rcna86440  Namely, the bill changes the ""work requirements"" from people aged 18-49 to 18-54, requiring a larger population to show they work to receive food stamps. The Congressional Budget Office estimates this will actually INCREASE federal expenditure (as the debt limit bill also exempts veterans, homeless, and young foster care adults from these work requirements), but the GOP claims this is incorrectly calculated.  Here is the bill, page 67 is the specific text. But it should be noted it is amending a previously passed bill, so you'd need THAT bill to read these amendments into it.  https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4024559-read-debt-ceiling-bill-to-avoid-default/",ProLifePanda,2023-06-05T10:02:28,2
