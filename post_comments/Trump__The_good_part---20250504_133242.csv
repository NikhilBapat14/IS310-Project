"Lies, lies, more lies. This guy spouts lies naturally, in any setting, multiple times, and it doesn’t matter if you show him the evidence to his face, he will call the evidence lies, and instead portray his view of reality which the 99% don’t live in. We live in the real world, with real problems. The dictator-in-chief lives in a fantasy world of his own making, surrounding himself with like-minded yes men (let’s be real, mostly men whose skin is the appropriate color) who help build up this unreal version of events.  Remember when he portrayed himself to be “the common man,” who is going to strengthen the middle class? More lies. Donald Trump wants to eliminate the middle-class and keep the masses poor, stupid and dependent, while the rich overlords get richer.",absolutelynotagoblin,2025-05-04T15:22:16,6
"Honestly, I'm sure I'll get down voted, but I felt this was the most sane interview I've ever heard from Trump.  - He said ""I don't know"" several times and deferred to his lawyers.  - He acknowledged the importance of dissent to democracy.  - He essentially said the economic benefits of tariffs were worth a recession and economic dislocation  - He said he doesn't believe a 3rd term is possible and looks forward to passing the torch to great Republicans  To me, this version of Trump is far more dangerous to me. His still has untenable positions, but with a much more sane and less confrontational delivery",realistdreamer69,2025-05-04T15:29:05,4
"Trump doesn't get that, at 100-days in, he owns it all -  good and bad.   But we know him. He ""doesn't accept responsibility for anything."" His own words.",Saucy_Baconator,2025-05-04T15:52:28,6

We were better off a second ago with this Hell administration. ,DuringTheBlueHour,2025-05-04T15:03:58,28
"Even in his first term, he at least had semi-competent people at the helm, even if they were the worst at the job.  Not this time around, he has surrounded himself with dangerously, grotesquely unqualified, incompetent ass kissing lunatics, and that's what makes this administration so insufferable. We have a cabinet full of James Bond villains - Kennedy, Bondi, Patel, Homan, Lutnick, Duffy, Oz, and each one is way more horrifying than the next. The only reason they're in these positions is because they sold out to Fox and kiss his ass 24/7.",G-Unit11111,2025-05-04T15:08:46,13
