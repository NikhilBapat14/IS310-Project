"It is a even crime if no one gets prosecuted for it?  He doesn't care. This is a victory lap for him. No matter what happens, he will get away with it.  He won't be impeached.  He won't ever be prosecuted. The next President won't bother, whomever wins.  He's old and will die soon, most likely.   He doesn't care and only enjoys how angry anyone sane gets about his corruption. Why should he care? Nobody can touch him. He won.",MagicianHeavy001,2025-05-02T21:36:03,1
