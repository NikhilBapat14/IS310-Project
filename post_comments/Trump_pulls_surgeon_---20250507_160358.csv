"To summarize:  She went to a foreign medical school - the American University of the Caribbean- but tried to say she ""Initially pursuing training at the American University"" leaving out the ""of the Caribbean"" part where it tells you its not American University.  She took 6 years to graduate instead of 4.   In US medical schools, unless you are getting an MD/PhD that is rare and typically would involve childbirth or a significant medical issue.    She then went to family medicine residency at the University of Arkansas which is a perfectly fine place to train but she lied about that, too.  She said she was a board-certified emergency medicine and family physician when she did not, in fact, receive any residency training or board certification in Emergency Medicine.",thingsorfreedom,2025-05-07T16:20:31,56

Well just because someone studied at a Caribbean school doesn’t inherently mean they’re a bad physician. I know countless who studied at that exact school or others and they’re fine (ignoring the for profit status and massive over acceptance and attrition). Those that make it through are usually good and still have to pass all the same licensing exams. Now it did take her 6 years to graduate though…,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T16:08:55,8
