"Trump isn't imposing tariffs to bring back jobs. He's  stated that he wants to use the tariff revenue to eliminate income tax revenue. The problem with that is people with lower income pay a higher portion of their income for necessities that would be taxed under the tariff regime. For instance, someone earning $50k per year will use 100% of their income on necessities. The tariff is 25% so their effective tax rate is 25%. The person earning $500k per year has the same basic requirements and feels luxurious, so they spend twice that amount ($100k on necessities). They pay 25% tax on 20% of their income, which results in an effective tax rate of 5%. Those earning  $1 million per year have an effective tax rate of 2.5% and the billionaires like Trump end up with an effective tax rate of .00025%.  It has everything to do with oligarch greed and nothing to do with manufacturing jobs that won't exist because all factories will be fully automated in 5 years.",EnvironmentUseful229,2025-05-08T09:33:09,11

"Rational political strategists like Karl Rove and James Carville have been saying this for a while. As has Steve Leisman on CNBC, along with VERY, VERY many of his colleagues and people on Bloomberg.  Progressive Dems and MAGA have been claiming political gravity doesn't apply anymore and that old ""Econ 101"" thinking is ludicrous. Both are insanely wrong, MAGA just hasn't found out (yet).    Americans, especially, love stuff and low prices. Only thing more important is price of gas. Various ideologies may think it's immoral, unaesthetic, that people should have higher ideals and goals. You can even torture poll questions and data to ""show"" this on various Left and Right issues. But when shit gets real, people act on the base of Maslow's Hierarchy and will utterly devastate you for believing their virtue signalling.   Carter got dragged for it, Bidenomics got dragged for it, and Trump's getting dragged for it when effects haven't even begun to hit. Empty shelves in a week are going to make today's polling numbers and reception for elected officials look like tremendous support.   Republicans are going to lose their effective majority in Congress in the next 90 days. 4 members defecting (assuming no D votes) is enough and Thomas Massie and Don Bacon are already most of the way there even though neither will caucus with Ds or vote for a D speaker.
