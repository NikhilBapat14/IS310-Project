"Trump has been criticized repeatedly over using a private cell phone for communications, disregarding security protocols. And his boy Kegsbreath is very casual with top secret communications, including his wife, brother, and lawyer. Their casual attitude is a bonanza for hackers.",joekerr9999,2025-05-01T07:09:27,67

They preached liberty while exposing your personal data. What a joke.,Euphoric-Bed7379,2025-05-01T07:10:32,13
"1) Who are the six POS justices that voted to give DOGE full and complete access to everyone's Social Security data? Names please.   2) What will this court do when Trump et al refuses to obey and goes into what are you going to do to stop us, mode?",TopEagle4012,2025-05-01T07:23:12,12
"If the Democrats ever manage to take power back and get in the driver's seat there \*MUST\* be severe legal consequences for everything lawless taking place right now, everything that's been happening cannot be allowed to fade away the way that Nixon did. There must be consequences.",TransiTorri,2025-05-01T07:57:39,6

">“[Hollander’s preliminary injunction] analysis of those claims and the preliminary injunction factors is lengthy, thorough, and compelling,” the appellate court’s opinion says. “Rather than repeating that carefully crafted analysis herein, I adopt and attach hereto the [preliminary injunction] Opinion in its entirety.”  That ""[Hollander’s preliminary injunction]"" is doing some real heavy lifting at the end of the article. Oh shit I dropped the   ""[preliminary injunction]""",Sachyriel,2025-05-01T07:02:12,2
"Not just that, Musk wanted all that nice data. Perhaps he made being able to access it, part of his (possible) deal with Trump to get him elected.",corcyra,2025-05-01T07:49:57,11
"Trump is emptying the tube, refilling it with shit, and forcing us to brush our teeth with it",MarkZuckerbergsPerm,2025-05-01T07:22:08,10
"Trump is wasting toothpaste by pushing it out a tube; Congress is worse than useless, more than half of them are okay with this, with the loud minority screaming at him to push more toothpaste out of another tube. A Federal Court has ordered the Trump Admin to stop wasting toothpaste, the DOJs appeal has been thrown out for being written in crayon. The Top Lawyer for the Marines (idk) has begun a campaign against the judge who threw out his motion for being written in crayon; The Armed Forces vow the stay apolitical, says Hegseth hungover and wishing he was anywhere else instead of the bright lights of congress.  The supreme court finds pushing toothpaste out of a tube a ""core competency of the presidency"".",Sachyriel,2025-05-01T07:16:26,6
That's what we all said in 2020. Hopefully things will go right at some point.,MrBeanCyborgCaptain,2025-05-01T10:43:17,5
