">“There is a dearth of research on psychotherapeutic approaches to managing gender dysphoria in children and adolescents. This is due in part to the mischaracterization of such approaches as ‘conversion therapy,’ the report said.  And there it is.",cowboycoco1,2025-05-03T04:40:22,33

"This is why. Singh, Bradley, & Zucker (2021) – A Follow-Up Study of Boys with Gender Identity Disorder •  Source: Frontiers in Psychology, 12, 2021 •  Study Design: Longitudinal follow-up of 139 boys diagnosed with gender identity disorder (GID, per DSM-IV) at a mean age of 7.49 years, reassessed at a mean age of 23.87 years (range: 13–30 years). Conducted at the Gender Identity Clinic in Toronto, Canada. •  Findings: 	•  Resolution Rate: 87.8% of participants no longer identified as transgender by adulthood, with 63.6% identifying as cisgender heterosexual and 24.2% as cisgender homosexual. Only 12.2% persisted with a transgender identity.",slavaMZ,2025-05-03T06:55:40,-16
"Yep. ""Gender Exploratory Therapy"" is the euphemism they came up with when conversion therapy bans really started getting imemented. It consists of forcing the person to ""more thoroughly explore"" their gender assigned at birth--meaning, forcing them to perform that gender more emphatically.  It's conversion therapy. Like, it *literally is*. If you cued up *But I'm A Cheerleader*, from the aughts, it'd be indistinguishable from what these people are demanding.  Oh, and apparently one of the lead authors of that ridiculous HHS report has been identified, and he's not even a medical professional. He's an MIT professor of fucking *philosophy*. Metaethics, or some such.  What a clown show.",Impossible_PhD,2025-05-03T05:10:44,24

Most of the people I have met that express hatred toward trans community say  1. There’s only two genders ( we know gender is made up and an expression of how you show your sex). Also there’s so many more than just two biological sexes so yeah that’s just wrong.  2. They are afraid of their kids being trans or just kids in general being trans. Not sure why this one is so big because like you said it’s such a small percentage. Much worse things for kids to be that you should be worried about. Not that there’s anything wrong with being trans.,Aware-Temperature282,2025-05-03T04:02:47,9

"So?  Firstly, 139 Canadians hardly makes for a complete picture on a diaspora which has existed since the beginning of history in every nation.  Secondly, trans kids have a right to discover their identities themselves. Many people discover things that would define their youth, they later discard for other pursuits. Just because a bunch of people who were Christian by way of influence of their parents when they were kids live in the southern and midwestern US, doesn’t mean I’m going to kidnap and torture these children to make them “realize” what they should do.

"Cannot stand Zucker. Huge agenda pusher for anti-trans ideology, he’s shown he’s happy to use biased techniques and problematic data again and again (Ashley 2018, Ansara and Hegarty 2012 2014).   Example: He’s been pushing for acceptance of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria for a long time. His work references the original study that led to the first discussion on RGOD. However, ALL participants for that research were recruited via parents on anti-transgender websites (Ashley 2018). He has made comments that show he is aware of the critique of the recruitment for that study, but hand waves it and continues to lean on it (Schoenike, Coltan 2023).  It’s obvious to anyone with more brain cells than RFK that it’s beyond problematic to exclusively use people recruited via hate-speech forums.  But hey, who needs scientific rigour these days?

"So mental health isn’t something just for people without gender dysphoria. All people deserve mental health and access to quality psychotherapy is one of the strategies to help the most vulnerable populations. Children have imaginary friends, children believe in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy so kids are very imaginative and easily manipulated. In particular, the population with gender dysphoria have significantly higher mental health issues which social media including Reddit have not helped.

"To be fair creationism and intelligent design are two different things.  Creationism is “God willed it, it was so, and fossils are an attempt to deceive.”  Evolution is “Typically, those with the most effective mutations survive/breed more, and in the fullness of time those mutations have created a myriad of species.”  Intelligent Design is “God guided evolution to achieve a beautiful universe.”  Evolution is scientific fact, or as fact as any other “theory” (like the theory of gravity) gets.  Religions vary on intelligent design, but it certainly doesn’t belong in a science class.",Grand_Stranger_3262,2025-05-04T02:21:00,1
