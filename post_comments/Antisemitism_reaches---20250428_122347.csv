"Honestly the continued need to assert an equivalence between Israel and the Jewish people as a whole is a big driver of antisemitism. Religious fundamentalist christians who want jews forced to israel to fulfill their doomsday scenarios and certain sects of zionists are very aware of this when they push for the association, because if antisemitism rise as a result of people associating all Jews with the actions of the Israeli government, that forces Jews to flee, and if this is happening globally it makes Israel the only option. The reason a lot of incredibly antisemitic people will try to associate criticism with Jews as antisemitism (while meanwhile ignoring actual antisemitism that's going on) is precisely related to this idea (as well as being used as a bludgeon against other groups they don't like)",Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-28T12:40:23,28

The *Forward* has reported exactly that:  >But the ADL acknowledged in a statement to the *Forward* that it significantly broadened its definition of antisemitic incidents following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack to include rallies that feature “anti-Zionist chants and slogans,” events that appear to account for around 1,317 of the total count.   >Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, has focused the organization on anti-Zionist activism and other criticism of Israel in recent years. Greenblatt first declared in a 2022 speech that he believes anti-Zionism is as antisemitic and dangerous toward Jews as white supremacism. He has ramped up that rhetoric since Oct. 7, stating in November that recent activism had “clarified and confirmed that fanatical anti-Zionism from the hard left is as dangerous to the Jewish community as rabid white supremacy from the extreme right.

Just because a majority of American Jews believe this doesn’t mean it’s true. As an American Jew in the minority I would disagree and say that anti Zionism is not inherently anti semtiics. That doesn’t mean there aren’t anti semitic people in the anti Zionist movement but the movement itself is not based around a hatred of Jews.

"So largely coinciding with Greenblatt's shift in focus onto anti-zionism?  Agreed.  >The Anti-Defamation League made waves last May when, in a major speech at the organization’s national leadership summit, CEO Jonathan Greenblatt announced that the ADL would devote more energy to combating anti-Zionism. “Anti-Zionism is antisemitism,” he said, promising that the ADL would apply “more concentrated energy toward the threat of radical anti-Zionism” through lawsuits, research, and lobbying. He described Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), and the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR)—all of which advocate for Palestinian rights—as “extremist” and the “photo inverse of the extreme right,” and implicated them in a rise in antisemitic hate crimes.

"You absolutely implied there might have been no actual increase in anti-Jewish hate and it was just anti Israel.

It is not a public opinion poll or an effort to catalog every expression of antisemitism.  And you ask:  >Was the increase in assault and vandalism actually just legitimate criticism of Israel's actions?  No one has said this or logically implied this.  If an incident of assault or vandalism that occurred before the broadening of the definition would not fall under the categorization, then it would not have previously been included, even if reported to the ADL.   It's not a record of all assaults of acts of vandalism, just of such acts (and others) that they categorize as antisemitic.

Also, you conveniently ignored the increase in vandalism and assaults on Jews. Was the sharp increase of vandalism and assaults on Jews that was trending up before October 7th just legitimate criticism of the Israeli government too?                       But you know what was the cause of hundreds of incidents in the report? Neo Nazi groups like Patriot Front who've become much more active and open in their actions over the last half decade. Unless you are going to tell me that the Neo Nazi groups are not real, or they are just making legitimate criticisms of the Israeli government.                            I've seen people similar to you so many times over the last year and a half. People who think they are well meaning, think they are tolerate and immune to unconscious bias. But they also refuse to believe that anger at the Israeli government's actions can also spawn hatred against Jews generally because that might cause some reflection towards some of the people they align with and that maybe there are some bad actors or extremists mixed in with other well meaning people. So rather than admit there might be a couple of bad actors on their side they make one hundred and one excuses why they can't trust Jews, Jewish groups, and the FBI when they all say hatred against them has gone up, even when that trend began years before. Ironically, that well meaning person's unconscious (or in some cases, overt) biases makes them antisemitic.                          So let me ask you to consider this, by default do you believe women when they talk about sexual harassment or sexual assaults? People of color when they talk about their experiences with law enforcement or racism? LGBT people when they talk about growing hostility online and from this administration? Haitian communities getting bomb threats during the whole 'they're eating our pets!' thing last year? Asians when they talk harassment or assaults because of anger at China and COVID? Arabs/Muslims when they see spikes of hatred after some terrorists half way around the planet kill a bunch of people?
