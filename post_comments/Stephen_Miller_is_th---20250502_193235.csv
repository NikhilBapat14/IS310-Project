"All I am seeing are downvotes on comments, yet no other statements.Â   This guy points out the common sense arguments the democrats try and avoid.Â   These are also the exact same positions of the Democratic Party of 20 years ago. Keep illegal immigration under control. Keep jobs for the middle class and avoid illegal cheap labor.Â   Do not DM me to harass, curse at me or call me an idiot or threaten me. If you call yourself the party of love and inclusion, you are a bunch of hypocrites.Â ",Iamstillhere44,2025-05-03T14:05:53,2
