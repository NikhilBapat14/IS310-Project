Apparently he has already been released so that’s good,Lantis28,2025-04-30T10:50:01,12
its nice to have some semblance of sanity for once this week,coatofforearm,2025-04-30T10:38:14,6
"What's the next step for him? I'm actually shocked they followed an order. Why can't they do the same for Kilmer?  So Mahdawi can continue his citizenship process. Is there any concern the process is politicized now? Like, will they just let him goto his citizenship appointments & then deny him citizenship? Maybe I'm being too cynical, but it is truly shocking to see good news.",CosmicLars,2025-04-30T11:10:41,3

A judge actually had their order followed? This is amazing,ufotheater,2025-04-30T11:03:37,7
I expected to hear that the judge was arrested for interfering with the Trumb Regime,NoEmu5969,2025-04-30T12:38:37,1
"This was just a *habeas* hearing on if he gets released.  There’s no jurisdiction that the court has on his immigration stuff.    Since he’s in deportation proceedings, at best his citizenship process is on hold but it’s more likely dead.",USPO-222,2025-04-30T11:38:56,2
If I were him I would just get out of the US on my own accord. But I guess that’s what Trump wants these people to do anyways,bad-and-bluecheese,2025-04-30T11:49:15,1
Judge ordered him to remain in VT and allowed travel to NY for school and meeting with his attorneys.  If he fled now he’d be a fugitive and any hope of returning would almost certainly be gone.,USPO-222,2025-04-30T12:31:43,2
