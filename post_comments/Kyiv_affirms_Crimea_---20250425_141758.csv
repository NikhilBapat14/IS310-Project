"Ukraine isn't getting Crimea back, Russia has been digging in since 2014.",roaming_art,2025-04-25T16:06:30,55
I keep wondering when some journalist looking to make their mark in life will start asking why the comedian seems so desperate to prolong this war when it's abundantly clear he can't win it.,The1Sundown,2025-04-25T14:58:59,-66
They also aren't going to give up their claim without something in return. It would be stupid for them to. If you are buying a house you don't tell them the maximum you are willing to pay if it's higher than asking ,AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-04-25T17:30:42,46

"Agree, it's a stupid take, unless Zelensky wants to sacrifice half a million Ukrainians to get Crimea back.  Russia demographics is horrendous.  In a couple of generations they will be gone.

"Once the full weight of those words… and the realization that Obama wasn’t fucking around nor one to be trifled with, especially concerning red lines… putin is gonna shit himself and pull all troops out of crimea. I mean it’s been over 10 years now… and still nothing… in fact, putin pushed even more… but it’s because Obama is so brilliant… it’s taken us all, and putin, a really long time for us to be able to understand and appreciate them. Any day now… it’s gonna hit putin and we’ll all finally appreciate the hard words Obama graced the world with.    Obvious as fuck /s",fearless-penguin,2025-04-25T18:44:49,3
