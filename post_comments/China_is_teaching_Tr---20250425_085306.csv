"He picked a stupid fight with the wrong nation. This is as much about saving face for both sides as it is trade. The Chinese are used to making large sacrifices for the good of the state, it’s engrained in their DNA. Donold, however, has to survive the midterms. When was the last time Americans had to make sacrifices for the perceived “greater good” of the country? Wait until all those appliances and shit from China become unaffordable. Easy to preach about the long term benefits to the US, but I have a feeling the American people who support these policy plays do so from the comfort of their Chinese made goods, in front of cheap Chinese TVs. China has already won the trade war. Now I’m just waiting for the fallout when Americans realise that the US populace does in fact pay for the egocentric whims of a geriatric.",Alighieri-Dante,2025-04-25T09:04:44,13

"Excellent opinion article explaining why China will not cave in to Trump's wish that they ""negotiate"" on tariffs -- basically, they don't need the US as much as the US needs China.   Even factoring in Trump's legendary ignorance and stupidity, that is a huuuuuge gaffe by Trump. One would think that Trump, who fantasizes himself to be a great strategist, would understand that you can't negotiate from a position of weakness if you want to win (I assume that's the point of ""Art of the Deal"").  The US lost most of its manufacturing base over the past 50 years or so due to inability to compete with foreign competition. His tariffs will not result in return to US manufacturing for commodity items (such as generic drugs), where the difference in US vs. Indian / Chinese cost of goods sold far outweighs any import taxes. And China has been expanding its outreach and aid to poorer foreign nations at the same time Trump idiotically cancelled US AID and kneecapped the anti-AIDS PEPFAR program; which were a source of goodwill towards the US.

"Trumps bravado finally met someone who can see him for what he is, an idiot. Xi has outplayed Trump at every turn, well most leaders have as only a handful of tariffs have stayed and not been sheepishly walked back.

"He put us in a position of weakness by deciding to take on the entire planet at once. There is a good case for some protections. I'd say critical medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, rare earths, auto manufacturing, semiconductors, and whatever I missed that would be important to national security. But we need a long term plan for that, with investment to back it up. Also if we really wanted to take on China why would we do it without allies? Couldn't we blunt tariff costs by sourcing products from outside China and bolstering those relationships?  Now that we've also alienated our allies our exports are going to take a permanent hit. Especially in the defense sector, who wants to buy US weapons if we can't be trusted and could install kill switches. Why should Europe buy our weapons when we have no stake in European defense? If we are a vassal or ally of Russia now can we guarantee we wouldn't stop weapons shipments to Europe when they need them most? Clearly Europe should bolster their own industries, benefit their own economies and keep defense spending as in house as possible.  Before we could count on Mexico and Canada if we were in a war. Metals/petroleum, whatever else needed for defense wouldn't be threatened by them. Now we're threatening to bomb Mexican drug cartels and threatening to annex Canada. All for the sake of trade imbalances that generally benefit us anyway.  Our auto manufacturing is now under threat due to these idiotic actions of Trump. There is no American auto industry. There is the north American auto industry. Virtually every manufacturing plant in the country relies on parts from all over North America. We have become far less reliant on Chinese parts, but north American integration is deep. Some parts are partially assembled in one place and moved across borders many times. Supply chains, and just as importantly labor must be carefully planned.  Why tariff food imports? A majority of those are things we don't produce here or at the minimum have enough demand to desire higher supply so we can get lower prices, like Mexican tomatoes. Canada is furious and boycotting our products, it's also happening in Europe.   Reciprocal tariffs will kill our export economy. Other countries have retaliated, namely China. They have the ability to shut entire industries down, or at the very least drive up major costs by cutting us off from rare earths, which they've done. Farmers are being wrecked because the alternatives available from other countries, China has made that move now too. Because we've taken on everyone at once it makes sense that other countries would cut out US exports as much as possible. Even if we come back hat in hand, could the world count on this admin not attempting to renegotiate again?   Now the dollar is being abandoned and capital is fleeing the US. Our debt was a problem, now it's a flat out crisis. Rising bond yields make financing our debt more expensive. The risks are crazy. The other authoritarian moves Trump is making (I don't have all day) also spooks investors. Why would anyone want to invest or work to build a business where crooks could steal if from you or give advantages to your competitiors?   Why? It's hard to imagine this was done to make America great. It seems to be a scheme to pump and dump the markets, though I'm only speculating. It also could be a scheme to create a patronage system where only those who find themselves in the favor of Trump, likely by greasing his palm,will be granted an exception. We know their are multiple avenues to give to Trump, his stock, his crypto, his PAC, maybe leaving a fat tip for staying at one of his hotels.  I can't possibly imagine this being for the benefit for all of us.  Can we finally lay the orthodoxy that Trump is a great deal maker to rest after these episodes? I can't keep it strait how many times he's flip flopped. I can't keep it straight how many times him and his surrogates have sent mixed messages, or begged China to come back to the table. If the US held all the cards why are they the ones begging for relief. It appears that now Xi is twisting the knife to either get us to totally return to the old deal or maybe he can get some fucking concessions, given the level of weakness Trump has shown.   This post has become insanely long, and I'll be surprised if anyone reads it, but I needed to lay this all out for myself. At the end of the day what did we gain from any of this shit? This is a joke, we've already lost. We lost our standing in the world, out exports will be hurt, our prices will go up. This is just a flat out fucking loss. There was no plan, no organizing principles. Just belligerent hubris, now the regular people will pay the price, and the wealthy insiders will buy stock at bargain prices.

">One would think that Trump, who fantasizes himself to be a great strategist, would understand that you can't negotiate from a position of weakness if you want to win (I assume that's the point of ""Art of the Deal"").  Trump's deal-making is highly exaggerated.  His negotiation tactics has always been to double-down on anything, and since he's usually the richest person he wins by benefit of being the richest person and thus able to suffer the least amount of blowback from his stupid decision.  Whenever Trump goes against someone with as many resources as him or more, Trump inevitably loses.     Instead of looking at China, IMO, the USFL (United States Football League) is a better example of how Trump ""negotiates"", and why Trump will fail.  The USFL was a (at the time) new competitor to the NFL and was making a profit and growing, mainly by having games outside of the NFL's seasons, football when the NFL wasn't doing football.  Trump wanted to buy an NFL team, and when the NFL said no, Trump bought a USFL team.  As the richest person in the USFL, Trump used his power to have the USFL compete directly with the NFL, ruining a good thing where each company was growing and making money.  This was horrible for both sides as it split the audience and revenue, making both the USFL and NFL unprofitable!  Both the USFL and NFL suffered under this, but the NFL, the bigger of the two and the one that could suffer the most losses, eventually won.     Basically the same thing is happening now with the trade war with China.",kia75,2025-04-25T09:41:52,2

"Regarding your statement supporting tariffs on drugs, see link to World Trade Organization agreement on tariffs -- which the USA signed. Import sales taxes on drugs raise prices and reduce availability for those in need. Pharmaceuticals should not be tariffed.  In particular, low-margin generic drugs cannot sustain cost increases due to import sales taxes. 40% of US pharmaceuticals are imported from India. Worse, the Inflation Reduction Act penalizes drug manufacturers who raise their prices in excess of inflation. The penalty is in the form of additional rebates to Medicare. I am certain that manufacturers of low-margin generics will discontinue many products if Trump establishes import sales tax for drugs as he said he would. Of course, Trump's word is worth nothing.

I wouldn't just do it across the board all the drugs, things like insulin will be needed if we were actually in a war and cut off from trade in whatever way.
