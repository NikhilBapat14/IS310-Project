"No matter how he feels about Putin, he's in an information vacuum with advisors poisoning the outcomes.   Gabbard: Curates intelligence briefings.  Vance: Ensures Trump believes the narrative.   Rubio: Silence.  If Trump reverts right back to business as usual, it may be the defining moment that Europe and Ukraine accept there's no path forward with the US.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T19:31:09,15
Classic case of getting your feelings hurt by your main squeeze and then pretending to flirt with their mortal enemy to try to make em jelly..but this ain't Papi Putin's first rodeo,nexxwav,2025-04-27T19:30:18,13
"Musk is still really influential on Trump that he is still the co-president. He seems to be fading out, but he is not as DOGE already controlled the federal gov, and Musk owns DOGE. Musk simply hate Zelenskyy, and both Trump and Musk love Russia because they think is the ideal state. White, not woke, traditional, and female is second class citizen.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-27T19:30:03,5
One phone call from Putler will flip that 180°.,PontificatinPlatypus,2025-04-27T19:49:22,1
"Until he makes up a silly jabbing nickname for Putin (ie sleepy Joe or the like), this is just lip service. Get back to nursing on Putins tip you silly orange man….",zimzimzalabimz,2025-04-27T20:33:34,1
"Yeah, give it a week and we'll be back. This is why nobody gives a shit what trump thinks. They know it'll change with the next meeting.",poliranter,2025-04-28T00:33:22,1
Putin murdering over a million on both sides and trump is disappointed? what sort of language is this?,fudgeplank,2025-04-28T00:51:12,1

Trump clearly does not understand that he is the bumbling clown in a barrel at Papi Putin's umpteenth rodeo.,ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T20:04:27,2
"I don't care about suit drama, but i do about people making shit up just to stir the pot. Your statement is factually incorrect about bidens suit color. Zelenskyys stance on kostumes is well known and respected in the international community, just not the oval office.",apintor4,2025-04-27T19:24:08,9
"Photos of the event show Biden in a black suit, though. ",Ordinary_Rhubarb5064,2025-04-27T19:27:44,2
"Are you wise to say that others are programmed? Because I’ve noticed conservatives get pissed about Canadians, Norwegians, and whoever else Trump decides to latch on to when his 79 year old brain sputters randomly.",VladtheInhaler999,2025-04-27T20:00:02,2
"From the pics that I have seen, Biden wore a black suit. Unless that is a very, very, very dark blue.  https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/news/world/2025/04/26/donald-trump-joe-biden-pope-francis-funeral/83294198007/",fungobat,2025-04-27T19:27:51,1
"People are doing it because it’s a callback to when Fox News and some republicans were outraged at Obamas tan suit years ago.    It’s a tit-for-tat exchange, not weird—obviously people had to think about it.",MusicFilmandGameguy,2025-04-27T20:08:45,1
"The funeral request was black suit, black tie. So, not that weird. Zelensky is busy fighting a hot war and the other two are half senile.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-27T19:25:25,1
