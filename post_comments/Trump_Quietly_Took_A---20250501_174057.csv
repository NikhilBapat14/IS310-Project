"This is all part of a preplanned assault on U.S. democracy.  Fascists have been trying to take over the U.S. almost since the inception of Fascism.  In 1933 Fascists plotted to overthrow the U.S. government and replace the President with a Dictator.  [The Business Plot (1933)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot)  >""When and if fascism comes to America it will not be labeled 'made in Germany'; it will not be marked with a swastika; it will not even be called fascism; it will be called, of course, 'Americanism.'"" - Halford E. Luccock (1938)  >The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.  >The American Fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism.  >They cultivate hate and distrust [of allies]. They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the State and the power of the market simultaneously they may keep the common man in eternal subjection. - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President, USA, 1944.

"Trump has taken a lot of steps - all at once - toward a single goal:  Healthy democracies rely on independent media to keep the public informed, an independent legal profession to maintain the rule of law, independent universities to guard objective truth and provide forums for dissent to authority, and independent State and Local governments to counterbalance a powerful Federal government.  Trump's regime is attacking independent media, law firms, universities, and State and Local governments that don't bend the knee and pledge unquestioning loyalty.  When fascists are consolidating their power and dismantling our democracy, you have to find out if you will accept the situation you're in. Either let that become the new normal, or do something. And with that risk everything.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-01T17:46:42,29

America does not have independent media. The major media outlets in America are run by corporations. And they are not in the business of doing journalism. They are in the business of selling eyeballs to advertisers.    Their viewers and readers are their product. Their customer is the advertiser. Journalism does not even enter into the conversation.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-01T21:17:13,10
"Handed down through generations.  Prescott Bush, self-avowed Nazi and father of U.S. President George H. W. Bush and grandfather of President George W. Bush, was to have been a ""key liaison"" between the 1933 Business Plotters and the newly emerged Nazi regime in Germany.

"Yeah, this whole fascist takeover has been quietly plotted for almost a hundred years. The first attempt (the Business Plot) failed, as did the second. (January 6th) But each time they learned and put their people in all the positions necessary to get closer each time. Consolidating the media under corporate control was part of the plan, specifically so there would be no independent media holding them back. And there's also a non-zero chance there was a lot of collaboration with Russia post-Cold War, especially after Putin took power and started molding the American right into a Russian asset.",LordSiravant,2025-05-02T00:11:16,3
