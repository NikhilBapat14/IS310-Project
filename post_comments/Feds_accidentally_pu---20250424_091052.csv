"THis administration is the worst at handling classified and confidential documents.  Beyond their willingness to inflict maximum pain on those that are already suffering, this is pathetic.",LaMarr-Bruister,2025-04-24T09:15:32,141

"It's truly disturbing that government lawyers, you know, just accidentally exposed a plan like this, especially considering the Value Pricing Pilot Program was initially approved under a previous administration, it really underlines how much the current administration seems determined to obstruct progress and I keep thinking about why the MTA was given those deadlines to kill the program, honestly, it suggests there was a deliberate attempt to sabotage a policy that genuinely benefits everyone, and it just feels like more than just a simple mistake, more like a coordinated effort, and something needs to be done.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-24T09:23:40,14
"It's really disturbing., something so crucial shouldn't be leaked like that, and I mean, what does this say about the oversight and security within those agencies, especially considering President Trump's earlier commitment to scrap the program, and you know, I'm particularly bothered by why the DOT didn't give the MTA money for congestion pricing if it was supposed to be part of a federal program... really makes you wonder about the whole process.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-24T09:34:21,11

They just want to punish NYC for not voting Trump; and for the fact that Trump has never really been accepted by the people of NYC.,rogue203,2025-04-24T09:27:03,71

It will be a 4 year fight and than some new President will end this   The truth is congestion pricing is here to stay because everyone loves it because it is a program that works every where it has been implemented,yoppee,2025-04-24T10:26:29,9

"No not happy to pay but take public transportation it’s affordable and convenient.have you sat through the traffic in manhattan?anyway I digress ;it’s only certain hours certain days to prevent gridlocks , I mean it’s swell when you dial 911 and the ambulance can’t get to you and you can’t even get yourself to the hospital, and yk just the general massive inconvenience of gridlocks .  Also Could this man not leak everything confidential? Does that not worry you ? I miss Regan , I miss bush , I miss Obama . They were REAL presidents.  I never seen a president go from so loved to so hated by people of their own party so quickly like we have seen with trump. Kinda wild to see people who have their yards decked out with trump things for YEARS take them down and start hating the dude they literally worshipped .

"Yea it's specifically to punish NYC for convicting him, or just their attitude towards him in general.  Considering congestion pricing isn't exclusive to NYC, for example northern Virginia also implemented it, but he hasn't mentioned that at all.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-04-24T16:14:57,1
"It goes way deeper than that.   Congestion pricing is an NYC versus NJ issue.   Trump came closer than anyone in recent memory to turning NJ red during a presidential election.

"Saying ""NY rejected him"" sounds like he was a transplant to the city who was rejected. But no, he was born and raised here; in Queens no less. New Yorkers HATE him, and have for almost his entire life.",MorningsideLights,2025-04-24T09:51:16,19
Progressive Democrat NJ governor Phil Murphy also opposes the congestion pricing. Thoughts?,New_Bodybuilder979,2025-04-24T20:52:11,1
He thinks bc people don’t want to pay they will easily side with him. Yet nyc runs on the Mta . NYC will side with the MTA before they side with that crook. But he doesn’t understand that. All he sees is his own ego and $. Bro has no heart and that’s why even his own people are turning on him .,ElephantAdventurous9,2025-04-24T18:44:21,1

"Actually…. This election cycle, NYC’s republican vote was the highest it’s been in over 40 years. They didn’t win the state, but instead of a proper squashing like it normally is, the margin was significantly slimmer than normal (it was something like normal 90:10, this cycle 65:35).",kylePrism,2025-04-24T17:20:06,1

"That’s because this case of congestion pricing is a two state issue, NYC and NJ.   If you’re not from NJ, I can understand why you wouldn’t see the political genius of this, honestly for as bad a person he is Trump is a master of politics.   NY/NYC will never vote Republican for president.   NJ might, and this move will make Trump popular with a lot of NJ democrats",New_Bodybuilder979,2025-04-24T20:51:33,1

"The turnout decreased slightly from approx 62% in 2020 to 59% in 2024 (citation: NYC Council Meeting (Committee on Governmental Operations, State & Federal Legislation meeting on December 4, 2024 @ 1:00 PM EDT).

"I'm just genuinely curious about what exactly he's said and done that would lead you to that conclusion? What makes him a 'good' man? It seems to me that he demonstrates a very clear lack of regard for the struggles of working people. The footage I've seen from him and his social media posts suggest that he holds very little sacred and really only serves himself.  Of course, that is only my impression of him.",randoman999,2025-04-24T21:46:14,3

I don’t see that at all. Check out victor davis Hanson on YouTube he has a unique view,Illustrious-Pea-5691,2025-04-24T21:53:48,1
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but from my brief look at his channel, it seems as though he's focused more on the Trump administration's economic and social policy rather than the man's character. I'm not questioning the efficacy of Trump's approach to politics. There is still plenty of time left to see how well he does as president. I'm more just curious about your judge of his character based on the words that leave his mouth and his actions. From the hours of footage that I've watched from him, he very rarely has anything of meaning or substance to say and, instead, resorts to diatribe and vaguery. He responds to challenging lines of questioning with accusations of bad reporting and fake news. He just doesn't do much to inspire faith in himself as a genuine leader who has the best in mind for the people of your country and, by extension, the west.",randoman999,2025-04-24T22:12:16,2
