Wait till you meet his boss.,Minguseyes,2025-05-02T16:07:33,358
"When it comes to Hegseth, there aren't enough characters in a reddit post to address all of his controversies and his incompetency.  But I'll try anyways...  This man's incompetence and lack of qualifications for his current position clearly illustrates the rampant cronyism of the Trump administration as it pushes the message that hiring should be based on ""merit"" alone.   But putting that aside for a moment, I also want to call attention to the glaring hypocrisy of those on the right who continue to defend Hegseth and downplay his association with white supremacist groups, arguing that his tattoos are being misidentified. Yet at the same time, they're praising immigration officials for falsely identifying foreigners and even legal residents as gang members based on non-gang affiliated tattoos.   Many of these individuals have no links to gangs and no criminal records or convictions. Nevertheless, these tattoos are still being used as grounds for deportation.  That being said:  Hegseth has been accused of being an extremist. Even a fellow service member once called him an ""insider threat"" after seeing a tattoo of his that's associated with white supremacist groups.  > The Army considers an insider threat someone who “is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from a person or people within the organization.”  Hegseth has, of course, blamed these criticisms on ""wokeness,"" and even wrote a book about it titled, “The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free.”  Hegseth was also pulled from his National Guard duties due to concerns from members of his unit.   Then there was his outspoken and controversial support for the Blackwater contractors who killed 14 unarmed Iraqi Civilians during the 2007 Nisour Square massacre in Baghdad.  > Hegseth lobbied President Donald Trump to pardon these contractors, which Trump ultimately did at the end of his first term.  Shockingly, Hegseth has also downplayed January 6th, particularly the violent role that any veterans played during the attack.  He's one of the most incompetent and unqualified persons for his job. So much for ""merit based hiring."" And for all of their whining, if the tables were turned, you know damn well that conservatives would be having a collective aneurysm if there was evidence of a democrat being linked to any one of Hegseth's controversies. And this obviously includes the part he's played in causing major national security failures.  But let's continue...  Hegseth previously led a partisan organization called ""Concerned Veteran for America,"" which has strong ties to the Koch Network. Hegseth was eventually forced out of the group due to ""mismanagement of funds, sexual impropriety and reports of intoxicated behavior.""  In fact, he was also booted from another conservative group, ""Veterans for Freedom,"" for similar complaints. Which raises questions about his suitability for a position that oversees the country’s largest federal agency that employs more than 2.8 million people.  A report about Hegseth's time as president of CVA describes him as being ""repeatedly intoxicated while acting in his official capacity and sometimes needing to be carried out of the organization’s events.""  Hegseth has been a Fox News contributor since 2014. Merit based you say? Sounds more like favoritism.  He has also been vocal in the past about his opposition to women serving in combat roles. Many women in uniform have expressed fears that Hegseth will hinder efforts to prevent sexual assault and harassment in the military.  Hegseth has been accused of sexually assaulting a woman in California after a speaking engagement. It's been reported that he barred the door to her hotel room and took away her cell phone.  Although Hegseth denied the allegations, he did pay a settlement to the accuser. Questions were raised when his account of the events changed while under investigation.The settlement also included a confidentiality agreement.   In the name of eliminating ""wokeness"" and ""DEI,"" Hegseth's DOD is also firing persons of color from high ranking military positions. People with distinguished careers and extensive military experience, making them much more qualified than Pete for their positions.  Hegseth also recently fired General CQ Brown, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a firing that was part of a broader 'purge"" of top military officials all suspected of being so-called ""DEI"" hires. How rich considering Hegseth's utter lack of qualifications for his current position and his recent displays of immense incompetence.  > Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth[...] tagged Brown with being a DEI hire.  > Although Hegseth had been meeting regularly with Brown... he openly questioned whether Brown had been named chair because he was Black. “Was it because of his skin color? Or his skill? We’ll never know, but always doubt – which on its face seems unfair to CQ. But since he has made the race card one of his biggest calling cards, it doesn’t really much matter,” Hegseth wrote in one of his books.  What a load of BS. Hegseth is using these rhetorical questions to justify his blatant discrimination.  Who's really obsessed with race here? Because it seems Republicans like Hegseth are the ones always presuming that race or gender has something to do with a woman or person of color being hired to a position of authority, glossing over the fact that maybe these people were hired because of their experience and qualifications.  > ""We want lawyers who give sound constitutional advice,” Hegseth told Shannon Bream on “Fox News Sunday”... “And don’t exist to attempt to be roadblocks to anything that happens in their spots.”  Saying the quiet part out loud... The goal here isn't ""merit based hiring,"" it's to install loyalists into positions of power where they can help Republicans skirt the law.  Following one of Trump's recent EOs, the DOD began eliminating ""DEI content"" by archiving pages that highlighted the contributions of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and minorities.  They also flagged over 26,000 images and countless web pages for deletion. This included tributes to historical figures and black military heroes.   The Pentagon also targeted pages honoring the Navajo Code Talkers and the segregated Japanese 442nd regimental combat team that fought in WWII.   The DOD has also overseen a comprehensive ""purge"" of ""DEI related"" terms and phrases from government platforms and online pages.  This included the banning words and phrases such as ""justice,"" ""dignity,"" ""respect,"" ""equality,"" ""inequality,"" ""female,"" ""women,"" ""socioeconomic,"" ""underprivileged,"" and ""cultural heritage,"" among many others... (Free speech my ass)  Most of what's being targeting isn't even associated with ""DEI."" But that hasn't stopped the Trump administration from giving itself the unilateral authority to dictate what constitutes ""DEI."" These measures are nothing short of authoritarian.  This effort only showcases the GOP's glaring hypocrisy and the demonstrable double standards they live by while they continue to cry about ""censorship"" ""free speech,"" and their self-victimizing delusions of ""reverse discrimination.""  Republicans continue to ignore this blatant contradiction while they espouse colorblind rhetoric yet complain that it's really the white, Christian hegemony that's under attack in this country.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-02T16:23:01,236

"The trump administration is nothing more or less than an attempt to validate white supremacy and patriarchy. I say all of this as a white man. White supremacy and patriarchy are based on the idea the highest black man and woman is inferior to the lowest white man. There is no job or skill a black man can do any white man can't do better, only skills that are beneath the dignity of a white man.   Obama turned this on it's head. A black man ran the country and didn't totally fuck it up. For white supremacy to be valid the lowest white man has to be able to do the same. Enter the 1st trump admin. He was the guy liberals and centrists said couldn't do it. But he was white. If he didn't fuck up the country it's not that black people are equal it's that the president is really a bureaucrat and the equivalent of a political burger flipper. White supremacy would only be truly challenged if Trump, I don't know, plunged the nation into a economic crisis after ignoring a pandemic and then did an unsuccessful coup... That would be embarrassing for white supremacy and patriarchy  If the first Trump admin was supposed to prove white supremacy, the second is to insist upon it. They are putting the least competent people in charge and insisting that they are successful because the alternative is that black and white people are really the same and just had different levels of access to education. They would have to admit they are not naturally superior and they will burn this nation before admitting that.",Niznack,2025-05-02T18:54:31,42
