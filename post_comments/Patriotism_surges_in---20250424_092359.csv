"Patriotism or informed self-interest? Either way, deal with the crisis now - it's either a competent guy who has the country's best interests at heart, or the RC Cola version of Trump. I personally do not like RC Cola.",steve_ample,2025-04-24T09:32:06,8
"In Australia we have a similar issue, on May the 3rd we vote in the federal election for either a Temu Trump or a Labor (Left Wing) Government. Labor is presently the party in power and has faced a lot of criticism over the cost of living.

Wishing you guys all the best when election time comes, genuinely.",Lostsock1995,2025-04-24T10:09:17,8

"Google Election truth alliance, we did not elect him.  fElon & Dump were looking at prison if they didn’t win, that tells you everything you need to know. Also we had millions of dem ballots denied, people voting absentee were denied w no reason. Mail in ballots didn’t arrive on time, arrived too late. It was a coordinated effort.",Katedawg801,2025-04-24T12:49:01,1
