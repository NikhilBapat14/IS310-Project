"Because this is straight from the Nazi playbook of declaring the disabled as ""useless resources"". 'Resources' is the same term RFK chose to apply to those with autism. The Nazis frequently described disabled people as “useless eaters”, “empty human shells”, and “life unworthy of life”. They chose these labels to evoke images of people who were incapable of doing anything, and so needed to be kept in institutions for their entire lives, wasting the tax dollars of non-disabled people.  In 1933 the ‘Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring’ was passed, allowing for the forced sterilization of those regarded as ‘unfit’. They started by compiling a registry by doing a survey of all psychiatric institutions, hospitals, and private homes for disabled and mentally ill people. Karl Brandt, doctor to Hitler, testified after the war that Hitler had told them as early as 1933—when the sterilization law was passed—that he preferred the killing of the incurably ill. So in 1939, Adolf Hitler signed a ""euthanasia note"" and Aktion T4 was set up, a campaign of mass murder by involuntary euthanasia which targeted people with disabilities. All children under the age of three who had illnesses or a disability, such as Down’s syndrome, or cerebral palsy were targeted. A panel of medical experts were required to give their approval for the ‘euthanasia’, or supposed ‘mercy-killing’, of each child. From August 1939, the Interior Ministry registered children with disabilities, requiring doctors and midwives to report all cases of newborns with severe disabilities; the 'guardian' consent element soon disappeared. Those to be killed were identified as ""all children under three years of age in whom any of the following 'serious hereditary diseases' were 'suspected': idiocy and Down syndrome (especially when associated with blindness and deafness); microcephaly; hydrocephaly; malformations of all kinds, especially of limbs, head, and spinal column; and paralysis, including spastic conditions"". In September 1939, they started killing adults with disabilities as well by having them shot by SS soldiers.  To those say that wont happen here, I would say just look at everything else they have already done. This administration is following in the nazis footsteps. It's now just a matter of which side you are on.",brithus,2025-04-23T21:30:23,60

Autism almost certainly doesn’t *have* a root cause. It’s a spectrum disorder; spectrum disorders of any type are typically caused by and affected by a plethora of interrelated fetal developmental conditions unpredictably intermeshed with genetics that are all independently (and also unpredictably) passed from parent to child.  That’s literally *why there’s a spectrum*. Trying to say something specific causes autism is probably analogous to attempting to build ikea furniture with just page 6 of 42 of the instructions and claiming it’s complete.,jjamesr539,2025-04-24T01:24:04,9

"I’ve seen a frightening amount of people (even here on reddit) defending this by saying he “only means people who are non-verbal and with profound autism.” I have spent years working with people of all ages that have been diagnosed with autism, and most of them would fall in to that category.   One of my clients comes to mind. He had 2 other siblings, both of them also diagnosed with ASD. One of his parents was diagnosed as well. My client was the youngest of their children and they loved all of their children, were always so supportive, and would do anything to teach them how to be more independent. ASD is genetic, and RFK is 100% advocating for eugenics in these remarks.

"If the research was being done by responsible scientists there would possibly be less of a problem with the program proposed. But it's being run by people who are misusing the technology that is available already to ""prove"" a point.  The data is available under a program that was finalized under the Biden Administration and has a lineage all the way back to HIPAA. It's the most recent iteration of the hazy IPA in the middle. It has a lot of promise to really help improve healthcare. But instead they're going to mine the data to support a conclusion and waste good time, good data, and good systems on their personal bullshit.  The easiest way to understand what this was meant to enable is to think of being on vacation far from home and having a medical emergency. You are unconscious when you arrive at the emergency department. They can still pull your complete medical record including the most recent and it's on allergies and medical conditions that might affect your treatment because they have emergency authorization to do so. Your records would be seamlessly transmitted to that hospital and made available to your care team there. That potentially saves lives.   Another scenario is being able to compare treatment and outcomes across a population by requesting data from health information exchanges. This program enables those health information exchanges to gather data on populations, treatments, and outcomes and make available to researchers only the data needed for the research.   Sure, be mad at the awful people these chuckle-fucks truly are. Be mad for their refusal to treat our fellow humans as such.

"I don’t think that figure is correct. It’s estimated that only 1% of the global population is autistic. It would need to be higher for 4/5 engineers to be autistic. The last I heard we were 1/4 autistic engineers. I wouldn’t mind seeing your sources for the 4/5 figure. I’m autistic too, and would love for it to be the case that we’re so well represented but I think that’s demonstrably not the case. Things would be very different if it were.  ETA: it’s also estimated that only 1/5 autistic people have a first degree, which is nominally a requirement to be an engineer of any variety, so the math really isn’t mathing for me.  Eta2: if you wanted to tell me that 4/5 engineers are either autistic themselves _or have an autistic sibling/parent_, that I could see — but that would also be a substantively different statistic.  Eta3: some quick math to demonstrate my point here — it’s estimated that 4% of the global population graduates with a first engineering degree, so if we generously say that every autistic person studies (some kind of) engineering and account for only 20% of them graduating, that means roughly 5% of people with a first engineering degree are autistic. If we’re generous again and say all of them that complete their studies graduate (so roughly 70%), that’s still only 17.5% of engineering graduates.

"you're both correct in your own standards. Deeper research on neurodivergence as a broader concept and research on high masking adults, indicate a much larger population than previously estimated - never diagnosed... A basic search indicates 15-20% neurodivergent in general population. Based on that, and clustering, a high percentage in certain fields is plausible.  Also, a narrow definition of asd, with all the traditional symptoms make the estimate closer to what you suggest. 2-5%...   Tricky subject though. It has always been so, but ignored due to early dominance of dogmatic psychology (up until dsm IV era). Once you start broadening the definition, quirky people go around and start using the concept to shield toxic behavior, clout, mask other issues. Once you start narrowing the definition, many individuals are left out, with no possible tools to understand themselves better, and manage their lives.   I've been taking quotient tests for a while, and score exceptionally high on empathy quotient, which makes asd directly discarded as possible diagnosis, but also score above threshold in asd quotients, systemizing quotients, masking quotients (except assimilation). TBH honest, I don't really care about the label, considering the possibility and looking into management had instant benefits on my life by improving how I manage my latent processing in some areas, and my burnout cycles. Bouncing between specialists the most common feedback I've heard was ""I can't define you as neurotypical, but the psychometrics don't match with any neurodivergent profiles"". And it's assumed that there is a large group that are very similar. Our understanding and current profile system is far from sufficient.   I really don't care about the label, and many really don't really care. But accurate diagnosis becomes much more important early in life, where adjusted expectations, household support and specialized education has extremely positive impact on academic success and life satisfaction later in life.

"We need to keep pointing this out. The dehumanizing and tracking of people with ""undesirable"" genetic traits is LITERAL NAZI SHIT.    The Third Reich had a well documented strategy that targeted people with disabilities that included claims that they weakened the German society, drained resources, and could never contribute to the financial, or cultural growth of the nation. They they were burdens, mistakes, that were millstones dragging down their families and neighbors.    Starting in 1939, doctors were commanded under the T4 program to ""euthanize"" people, especially children, deemed ""unworthy of life"". They set up a national registry in hospitals, and required doctors and midwives to report children born with any ""deficiencies"". When parents were uncooperative, they claimed they were sending the children for SPECIALIZED treatment, killed them, and took samples of their brains for study.    Between 275,000 and 300,000 people died this way. The program was a test case for the later murder of Jews, and started with sterilization of people diagnosed with a broad swathe of conditions including being deaf or having a chronic illness.

"OC was talking specifically about engineers having an autism spectrum disorder, and I approached them from the same angle. The landscape changes dramatically if you consider the broader category of neurodivergence as you have.  When we consider the narrower category of ASD — as both OC and I have — the available data would suggest that 80% isn’t actually possible. If we interpret generously, account for clustering etc, and for increased rates of diagnoses, then (and this is back of the envelope) the number would be at most around the 35% mark. The reality is likely that the generous interpretation is inaccurate — I don’t believe for a second that _every single autistic person_ studies an engineering discipline — and in any case ignores the employment figures for asd persons.  You and I do at least agree that the landscape — in terms of both the available data and literature on the topic — has a long way to go, and that the actions of people like RFK are indeed putting those efforts back by several decades.  I find OCs comment frustrating because if we were 4/5 engineers with ASD, then we wouldn’t need to fight so hard to be seen and for workplaces to better meet our needs. The challenges that autistic people face in the workplace every single day are evidence enough that it’s simply not possible there are _that many_ of us.

It being a spectrum and a poorly defined one which may be more common among the population,  does not dilute the validity of your experience - as it does not dilute the validity of my ex BIL's.     The field needs more research. And I'm saying this with my Psychologist hat on.    edit: and I agree that individuals have different needs. And I also believe that the society should be more human oriented,  to accomodate for different needs of different individuals. Society should leave the 20th century human prototype idealism, and start considering people with different disorders, disabilities, needs. In workplaces, education, childcare,  services... I'm not trying to argue with you, I'm just stating that you both have a point. And that there is no preset paradigm yet.   Edit 2: As a former psychologist, I was trained on dsm-IV. My awareness concerning nd and asd was very limited until very recently. Actually-until YT algorithm started suggesting me videos about masking adults out of nowhere. I brought it up to my therapist and they refered me to a specialist for preliminary consultation and psychometrics. We then started learning together,  integrating the awareness into our sessions. And I realized,  had I been more aware of the implications, I would have approached a few of my former clients very differently. ",idulort,2025-04-24T23:44:35,0
"Careful, reddit admins don't want you to talk about Republicans that way.  I hope when all this is over, the media and social media companies and the people that work for them (like reddit) are fully held responsible for letting nazi rhetoric flourish, while killing off and slowing down efforts to stop it.  The have blood on their hands and aren't even trying to wash it off.",Coolegespam,2025-04-24T04:51:33,16
Fun fact: the Nazis actually got a lot of their heinous ideas from the American eugenics movement.    Welcome to the evil oroborous,strangerNstrangeland,2025-04-25T02:11:22,2
But surely it's clear I only talked about Nazis. Surely.  And even if I wasn't... what are they gonna do? Suspend my account? Boohoo. I'll make another one.,Barbarus_Bloodshed,2025-04-24T06:07:13,7
