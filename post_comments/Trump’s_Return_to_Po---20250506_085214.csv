"Back in my day, conspiracies and kooks were more fun.  They were about Elvis still being alive, Paul McCartney being dead, and the chupacabra.  Now they're darker, angrier, and more paranoid than ever before and let me tell you, it's too depressing to listen to.",Impossible-Fox4498,2025-05-06T10:01:24,3
"The election was bought and paid for by the wealthiest individuals in the country.  Trump left office with a 37% approval rating and then became the come-back king with the lowest approval rating (besides Nixon) and won the first popular vote for a Republican candidate in 20 years since Bush in 2004. AND won all 7 swing states, which hasn't happened in 40 years. One monumental election event I could have believed, but two makes it a coup.  https://electiontruthalliance.org/",Financial-Special766,2025-05-06T09:25:46,2

Well....these days you can hardly tell the difference between a conspiracy theory and the various insane events happening in this country.  Conspiracy theorists are becoming obsolete with this administration.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-06T08:55:18,0
