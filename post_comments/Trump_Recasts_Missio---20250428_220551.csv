"""the new administration appears intent on not simply modifying the direction of the work, **as has been typical during changeovers from a Democratic administration to a Republican one.**  Bold added by me as this perfectly demonstrates exactly how the GOP prior to maga utterly failed to protect conservative values or stand up for conservative principles.  If anyone wants to know how we ended up where we are as a country... It is because when given the opportunity to fix problems, the old GOP chose to not rock the boat instead of doing what they were elected to do.",Shadeylark,2025-04-29T11:25:42,2
