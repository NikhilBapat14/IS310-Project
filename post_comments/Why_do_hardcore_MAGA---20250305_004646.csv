">Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.      ― Jean-Paul Sartre  There's nothing *particularly* novel about contemporary American fascism. They know full well that they tried to murder the vice president and overturn an election, and they don't think it's a problem. They'd do it again in a heartbeat if the occasion called for it. The conspiracy theories aren't for themselves. They're for everyone else, not to be convincing, but to obfuscate. To waste everyone's time with pointless argumentation while they carry on dismantling liberal democracy.",Mjolnir2000,2025-03-05T03:36:49,349
"Ever since Trump took office and Zuckerberg, Musk, and Bezos sat behind him at the inauguration I have been non stop hit with Right wing propaganda about how great Musk and Trump are. I’ve tried blocking, snoozing, reporting but it keeps coming in massive waves. There is no way to have Facebook and not see it.

"I had a lengthy argument with my brother who is a maga supporter about this topic.  He didn't resort to conspiracies (although he is prone to thinking that way). Instead, he focused primarily on how the BLM riots were actually a bigger problem for the country (""but the media isn't talking about that"") because they created more lasting policy changes, thereby encouraging more violent protests as a means to enact policy changes.  My rebuttal was primarily along the lines of ""but nothing they did was an actual threat to democracy. Even if they somehow took over multiple cities completely, none of the mechanisms of democracy were threatened""  His response was that nothing was actually threatened on January 6th either since there were guards surrounding Mike Pence, escape tunnels, and secret rooms to hide in if needed. Basically, there's no realistic way (in his mind) that Mike Pence could have actually been hurt, so the ""protestors"" (as he called them) weren't any actual threat to democracy. He actually said ""it's not capture the flag -- democracy doesn't just end because some people take over a building for a little bit""  We argued for hours and I tried my best to explain to him that he's looking at it with the benefit of hindsight, and we actually have no clue how close we came to Mike Pence being killed. I didn't make any progress at all though and we eventually just had to agree to disagree",GiantBearr,2025-03-05T06:11:56,48
"Cognitive dissonance.  On some level, they recognise they’d be furious if positions were reversed and it was a left-wing mob that had tried to break the Capitol down. They do understand that it doesn’t look great, and that it wasn’t well received. For some, they may even understand why this is the case.  However, they’re not willing to accept that anyone on **their side** (who they want to think of as good, and more importantly as CORRECT, since if Their Guys are good then that reflects goodness back on them and their judgement/intelligence/understanding/morals) could have allowed or encouraged The Clearly Bad Thing to happen.  Looking for another explanation allows both needs - “My Guy is a good guy! He was and is right!”, and “This would piss me off if our opponents did it” - to be met.      They can be angry, and get the emotional fulfilment of what feels like righteous anger, while not needing to challenge their self perception of themselves as moral, reasonable and intelligent people who support moral, reasonable and intelligent political options.

"Not sure on the psychology of the matter, but I've noticed a lot of it is just never taking accountability for the actions of their own. On the macro level, you'll see this in how *everything* is a false flag. On the micro level, I saw an article yesterday where Sean Hanity accused callers complaining about Trump were secretly democrats.   Why do I think they do this? I think a decent chunk of these people are abusive. Maybe not up to the level of physical abuse, but a lot of these people see being an absolute dick as nothing more than a game and it borders on anti social disorder. One of the nasty little tactics abusers employ is called DARVO, or Deny, Accuse, Reverse Victim Order.   Denying is obviously the big one, but reversing victim order is also a big part of the discussion. Not only will they not take responsibility,  but the typical MAGA is also a perpetual victim. They didn't vote for the racist because they wanted to, you see, but because they have economic anxiety. When not calling Jan 6 a false flag, they'll say that those arrested and incarcerated are victims of ""lawfair.""   Another commenter quoted Satre, so I'm not going to. But I think the point is salient when interacting with these kinds of people. They aren't serious people, and you shouldn't treat their arguments as serious. Just keep repeating the point until the game isn't fun for them anymore.",beastwarking,2025-03-05T05:35:11,15
"Steve Bannon’s “flood the zone with shit” strategy is a well-known tactic he has advocated to manipulate media narratives. The phrase originates from his time as a strategist for Donald Trump and refers to the idea of overwhelming the public discourse with so much disinformation, controversy, or chaos that people become exhausted and disengaged.  The core idea is that if there’s a constant barrage of sensational or misleading stories, it becomes difficult for journalists and the public to discern what is important or true. This strategy is often linked to far-right populism, where traditional media institutions are undermined, and trust in objective facts is eroded.  Bannon’s approach aligns with a broader trend of using information warfare to shape political landscapes. He has applied similar tactics in his work with Breitbart News and various global right-wing movements. The goal is often to distract, deflect, and disorient opponents while energizing a specific base of supporters.",[deleted],2025-03-05T05:24:04,8

From the surface, (legacy media coverage) - it can be assumed that trump essentially told everyone to go crazy and stop the certification. But there’s much more context now to suggest something hidden and more nefarious were happening simultaneously.  You really get a better understanding of this when you elevate your mind past being a maga supporter or supporting the democrats. When you can assess both sides throughly, there is a shadow war happening behind the curtain of Fox News, abc, cnn, msnbc etc. Bigger players like multinational corps, 3 letter agencies, private multi billionaires and other countries governments are jockeying for position to solidify their future and what we see playing out on our tvs and phones is a Lower level manifestation of that war.",WatchWhatHappensNow,2025-03-05T19:44:27,3

"Dan Bongino got promoted from alt-right podcaster to deputy director of the FBI by spreading those FBI J6  claims, so I guess some may be auditioning for similar promotions.

"I believe a large part of it has to do with the political division in our country. Everything has become “you’re more bad than we are, and to prove it we won’t accept blame for anything we’ve done”. Both sides have become increasingly conspiratorial. This is made worse when one side pushes wtv topic so hard, that the other side feels they have to push back equally hard.  Watching J6 in real time was a truly crazy experience. The right felt empowered by the riots in response to George Floyd and felt “if they can go wild over this matter, why don’t we go wild over this other matter.” And when you have people in power pushing conspiracy theories, their following is even further emboldened.   This is true for media as well. Right-wing media tried to push it as a “peaceful” protest, and when that didn’t work they switched to conspiracies. This was furthered by the videos involving Ray Epps, people already labeling him a fed at the event, and then what followed was clips of the FBI refusing to comment on Epps so it was a “perfect storm” moment for the right.  Left-wing media, in my opinion, pushed it a little far as well. There have been many cases of them suggesting everyone involved should be arrested, and whether or not justified that makes it easier to label it as political prosecution. They also attributed all of the deaths to the rioters, including the suicides that happened days later, and when this is spread people feel as though they’re being cornered. There are people on the left calling this election stolen, and are currently being emboldened to stage an “uprising” or “revolution” against the current administration. Validity of argument aside, there’s a lot of similarities. I’m just hoping we don’t have another J6. Sun Tzu advised to give the enemy a means of retreat. This is a good example where the left essentially blocked retreat on the topic, therefore many people were pushed to stand on it or “kneel to the demands of the left” as it is branded by the right.",justjackbro,2025-03-05T08:54:53,3

"Because we have video evidence, emails and congressional testimony that key actors like Pelosi, head of the DC FBI office and DC FBI agents were integral in the last second changes to security that day and decent amount of the protesters were under cover FBI agents.   For example, Trump had 10,000 reserve troops brought to DC, but didn't have the authority to put them in place. That fell to Pelosi as the Sergeant at Arms in congress ultimately reported to her. She ordered the troops not be deployed, even though they were already in DC. This also means that she left 10,000 troops outside, in the cold and wind for hours.   During the congressional investigation, Dems dragged their feet for almost two years on providing the security tapes. They finally gave it up, but 500 hours of footage was missing. Their rational was that it was ""accidentally deleted"".  The problem is, none of this was reported by the media. Any coverage it did get was dismissed as ""Trump/Maga conspiracy"".

"Most of the people at the Capitol on January 6th were Trump supporters, there’s plenty of proof of that. But does that mean the whole thing was just MAGA’s fault? Not necessarily.  Here’s why some people think there’s more to the story:  1. **FBI Involvement** – The FBI has a history of using undercover agents and informants to spy on groups they think are dangerous. Some might have been at the riot, but there's no clear proof they started it. 2. **Paid Agitators** – Some believe people were sent in to stir up trouble and make Trump supporters look bad. While a few individuals seem suspicious, there’s no solid evidence that this was a big organized effort. 3. **Government Cover-Ups** – The government might not be telling the full story. Some January 6th rioters got harsh punishments, while rioters from other protests (like in 2020) were treated differently. That makes people question if the system is fair. 4. **Media Spin** – The media called it an “armed insurrection,” but most people there weren’t armed. Some were violent, some just wandered around. The news only showed the worst parts to push a certain narrative.  So, was it all a setup? Probably not. But is the government and media twisting things for their own benefit? Absolutely.

There was no Antifa, no FBI involvement, it was the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys and just a bunch of Trump MAGA nuts who did it all.  The ensuing investigations that took place after the insurrection led to the arrests, prosecution and sentencing of over 1,500 of these criminals  and sent them off to prison where they belonged and still belong.

After Trump pardoned these criminals, there were several of Trumps followers who refused to take the pardons and remain behind bars and have publicly said that they are guilty, took part in the insurrection, admit that what they did was wrong and will serve out their sentences.

"Because they stick with their party doesn’t mean they stick with their “guy” much.  Republicans often use the primary to get rid of an incumbent while Democrats rarely do and allow the DNC to mess with theirs.  (As we saw with the second Hillary primary and the fact they even have a super delegate system to give party insiders an extra vote.) That is Democrats absolutely closing the door behind them as the party is getting stagnant with few new blood prospects now for the presidency after Obama.    The self imposed term limits on committees from Republicans has help them keep the door open for new blood and ideas as the old guard usually steps down sooner when they run out of coveted seats of power.  They don’t mess with their primaries either and party insiders definitely wanted to when Trump was running.  They allowed the primary to do its job and Democrats resist it much to their detriment.  A primary keeps a party together and captures political movements to make that momentum their own. That alone show how the DNC is at odds with their voters, but the voters don’t ever do anything about it and continue to trust that their elderly leaders know best.  That is loyalty to a fault.

Also this idea of “fake-centrism” isn’t necessarily false, but it is being recklessly applied to anyone who finds themselves in the middle. My personal belief is that right now would be the best time for a 3rd party, a party of reason and compromise, that can recognize that both sides of the aisle can be wrong and can have a little bit of both ideologies. For wtv reason this is crazy in the current political climate.  I also feel the word “fascist” is being applied recklessly. There are fascists, and we should oppose fascism, but being a republican does not equal being fascist. Being a centrist does not mean you’re allowing fascism. If we were to ever in this country have a dictatorship, I’d be on the frontlines myself. But throwing fascist around to everyone that doesn’t agree with you is disgusting.  Claiming that a “both sides” argument is invalid is excusing your party from responsibility, regardless of left or right. We all have a responsibility to find common ground and compromise, as opposed to entrenching in our beliefs regardless of what is best for the country. I do not agree with our current administration, but I would also not agree with it if it were a democrat doing the things in the same manner.

Further still, the nine BLM deaths are:  >Garrett Foster was reportedly carrying an AK-47 rifle when he was shot to death in July by an armed man who had been driving a car through a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters in Austin. Whether Foster threatened the driver with his gun is still disputed. The man who shot and killed Foster, the US army sergeant Daniel Perry, had previously tweeted “Now is the time to take up arms and protect yourselves against violence” and responded to a Trump tweet in June about “protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters” by saying, “Send them to Texas we will show them why we say don’t mess with Texas.”  >In Kenosha in August, a 17-year-old carrying a rifle he was not old enough to legally possess shot and killed two people, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and seriously injured a third at a volatile late-night protest. His lawyer has argued the teenager, who came to Kenosha from Illinois, was also acting in self-defense.  >In Louisville, the photographer Tyler Gerth was shot and killed at a downtown park where protesters gathered. The alleged shooter, Steven Nelson Lopez, was homeless and had a history of severe mental illness, and had reportedly been asked to leave the park earlier because of his behavior.  >In Las Vegas, Jorge Gomez was wearing body armor and carrying several guns when he was shot to death by Las Vegas police at a protest in June. Before he was shot, several protesters told Gomez they disapproved of him being armed, and even a journalist questioned him about why he was holding his gun in his hand with his finger on the trigger, the Las Vegas Sun reported.   >James Scurlock, a Black Lives Matter protester with an infant daughter, was shot to death in Omaha in May after a confrontation with a white bar owner outside the man’s bar.  >Other demonstrators died when cars drove through or rammed into crowds of Black Lives Matter protesters. Summer Taylor, a Black Lives Matter protester who worked in a veterinary clinic, was killed in such an incident in Seattle.

"When she said ""I take responsibility"" the full statement was ""responsibility for not having them (capitol police) prepare more,"" and the full context was prepare for emergency/evacuation procedures, normal stuff. Re: the National Guard support request - the chain of command to request from the Executive branch is the capitol police chief goes to two Sergeant-at-Arms (of House and Senate), who will check with Nancy and Mitch McConnell - so there was some shared responsibility for not having requested it well in advance, but it was requested on the day.  But the point is - the ""just asking questions"" conspiracy stuff is never JUST asking questions, there is an implied alternate narrative of who and why caused the events to take place. But you never get beyond the ""just asking questions"" because it quickly devolves into nonsense if you look for an actual counter-conspiracy. Like if Nancy were some sort of false flag mastermind, what are her motives, what was the end game, what were her risks? Biden had already won, they were inches from the finish line, why risk all of that, and moreover risk her own life by inviting a real mob including armed militia folks into the capitol? There was a real risk that she'd be handing DJT what he already wanted - an excuse to declare martial law or national emergency, etc - it never adds up, and meanwhile the mainstream narrative makes perfect sense, juries convicted on it, convicts admitted to it, etc, etc - sure there are some loose ends and unanswered questions, but given the nature of the unplanned mob, there are bound to be some head scratchy chaotic details.",peetnice,2025-03-05T20:40:54,1

"I’m not saying compromise with fascists, that said you shouldn’t attribute fascism to all republicans.  Several answers. There are radical leftists in the US in the sense of antithesis to the far right, there are people who ride or die for leftist ideals but you don’t hear about them bc honestly there isn’t a group as bad as MAGA right now. This doesn’t mean radical leftism doesn’t exist. There are socialists in the US. In the globe, there are many communist countries, which is a far left ideology.  I’ll reiterate that MAGA can’t be compromised with, and what MAGA has become should not have a place in this country.  But MAGA does not define republicans as a whole, many republicans are stuck in a trap. They disagree with MAGA, many don’t like the current administration, but many have dealt with years and years of being branded as Nazis, racists, fascists, etc from the left bc nobody is allowing room for compromise. So the stance has become ON BOTH SIDES “why would I agree with them when all they do is group me with that group of idiots”. They’ve recognized that compromise isn’t being allowed, and decided that in order to hold on to some shred of what they believe in they have to vote red. This is wrong, but it is the fault of both sides of the aisle. If we prioritize compromise, we can bring the in betweeners all together. What doesn’t work, is blaming every Trump voter or every Biden voter or every left or every right for actions that are outside of their control. Many people who voted for Trump didn’t know it would go this far, but they still get bashed for every single thing that happens. That does not provide an environment of fruitful discussion.",justjackbro,2025-03-05T11:19:26,2
