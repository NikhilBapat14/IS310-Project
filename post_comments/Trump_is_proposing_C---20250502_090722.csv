Adding 150 billion to the military and another 150 billion for ICE. So overall spending will be up. While getting rid of anything decent or compassionate.,mytthew1,2025-05-02T09:16:23,14
"But the defense contractor grifting budget gets ballooned to over a trillion dollars.   Our country has no money for kids' lunches in schools but can drop a 60-million-dollar plane into the sea like it's no big deal.   We don't have money for universal healthcare, but can spend 100 million on an unneeded military parade for dictator Trumps birthday.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-02T09:11:36,21
This fucker and his cult are actively at war with working people.,Elmer_Whip,2025-05-02T09:38:14,7
"I read defense spending, so I was impressed at first was. Although even it was defense spending the savings would come in the form of cutting pay and benefits for brown soldiers.",phxees,2025-05-02T09:46:10,3
"""Those cuts are for spending that Congress authorizes each year — which does not include spending on safety nets like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  The cuts, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, represent a 22.6% cut in projected spending for the current fiscal year.""",zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-05-02T09:08:16,2
Take it from Musk.   Rescind non-profit status from mega churches and all churches that so much as hint at a political position. Budget balanced.,BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T09:38:45,2
He’s just filtering tax money to himself. We are so stupid just sitting and watching it all happen.,greenbigman,2025-05-02T16:33:20,1
And losing approximately $500 billion in tax revenue because DOGE cut the IRS to the bone isn't going to help either.  [Source](https://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/2025/03/25/irs-cuts-may-cost-500-billion-in-lost-tax-revenue-as-taxpayers-exploit-system/157841/),biscuitarse,2025-05-02T09:30:03,9
The 100s of billions is to fund tax cuts for the rich if he actually does what he says. He flat out told us that's what he want's to do.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T09:31:26,4
"Outside of military spending, it has to be social programs. There is no where else to cut that much spending from. Despite DOGE firing people at random, you aren't going to save 100s of billions in federal salaries. I don't know how much people think those folks actually make, but it's not pro athlete salaries.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T09:33:08,6
GOP been at war against working class since the 70’s.  And they e been winning by convincing the working class to vote for them.  It’s crazy.,teamdiabetes11,2025-05-02T11:47:23,2
"Increasing defense spending and cutting taxes just gooses the economic engine and makes the numbers look good to tout on social media and make headlines on Fox News.  Meanwhile the costs of housing, child care and healthcare go unaddressed. Trumps first term was Exhibit A, and now we have Exhibit B.",centexgoodguy,2025-05-02T09:44:07,5
They say they will cut spending for tax cuts but they are increasing spending before tax cuts.,mytthew1,2025-05-04T09:35:55,1
