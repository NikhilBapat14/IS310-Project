"He just declared President Biden’s pardons void. If his DOJ actually tries to re-arrest/charge those President Biden pardoned, we’re in a massive constitutional crisis.

"It’s just pointing up that there’s a fatal flaw in our system. The Constitution provides a remedy for an executive that ignores court orders and laws, the impeachment process. Unfortunately the founders didn’t seem to think it through enough and didn’t realize that Congress might be so fully captured by the President’s political party that that process would become toothless.  The Supreme Court is going to, as it has done before, remind people that this Consitutional remedy exists. Even though they know that it is broken.",PMMEBITCOINPLZ,2025-03-17T02:41:02,139

"Yes actually it does form a constitutional crisis. We have a power-hungry, manipulative, abusive wanna-be Putin in office, seeking total control to turn our nation into another Russia. He will not stop until he is stopped by us. Federal judges may issue court orders but Trump will defy them until he is arrested and jailed, and even then I expect he would not stop his defiance.

"There effectively is no constitution right now. The president has usurped the legislature’s powers to make laws and to direct spending, he is openly defying court orders, and he has declared himself above judicial review on all national security matters, which of course he defines to mean anything he wants. This is not a crisis of ambiguous constitutional provisions leading to conflict between branches. This is a crisis of a would-be dictator ignoring the constitution to do whatever he wants.

The trump regime has been actively violating the constitutional order since day one.  It has been usurping powers reserved solely to congress.  And it has no intention of following court orders when the courts have no means to enforce their rulings.    Literally everything about the American system hinged on people honoring their oaths and fiercely defending the separation of powers.  It was always possible for what is happening to happen.    The constitution has several unpatched vulnerabilities that has allowed this to happen.  Foreign and domestic enemies figured that out a long time ago and have been working within the republican party and conservative media to bring this about for decades.   There is no mechanism for people to stop a rogue president whose party controls congress and the supreme court.,JDogg126,2025-03-17T06:24:14,14

"Yes, but it is important to realize that we've been in a constitutional crisis for virtually all of Trump's term so far. Most of the things that DOGE has done are either illegal, fall outside the authority of the executive branch or both. Many of Trump's executive orders are overreaches of executive power  because they try to usurp powers that the constitution specifically assigns to Congress. Etc.  Trump's tactics are basically ""try and stop me,"" which is extremely dangerous for our democracy because it means that until someone does stop him his powers are essentially without limit.   And he needs to be stopped each time he performs or enables an illegal action which we **know** isn't going to happen with a GOP controlled Congress. And that means the executive branch's power will grow beyond the limits of the constitution unless Democrats take control of congress and can claw some of those powers back. But it takes time to fight things out legislatively or in the courts, and unfortunately signing an executive order takes practically no time.",almightywhacko,2025-03-17T10:22:17,5

"We have the most useless Congress of all time. It’s been pretty bad for over 50+ years. After they pulled the whole two party system and locked that in every possible direction from the ground up. There has not been much anyone can do to finically compete in enough numbers to fix this. The money for both parties is solidly in place, no one has any reason up on top to go at Trump.   We couldn’t even get the Democrats or Republicans to stop insider trading(none of them are willing to undermine their own power). Trump is not doing anything that steps against the politicians, the money that feeds them, or their power hold on the system. No one has in a very long time. Is what it is. The system will go at Trump if he goes at the rest of the ruling class in the USA. Doubtful since no president in most of our lifetimes has been dumb enough to do that.",BlackMoonValmar,2025-03-17T03:10:05,8

"The term ""constitutional crisis"" is not a good frame for what is happening. Some of his misdeeds are clearly constitutional but horrible, e.g., pardoning the Jan 6 rioters and appointing incompetent flunkies to high level positions. Others are devious but not unconstitutional, e.g., delayed and/or incomplete responses to lower court TRO's and offering to pay federal workers to resign.

We've been in a constitutional crisis since he's been in office with the looong list of unconstitutional orders he's been making. This one is just another added to the list.

"Trump has the ultimate trump card on this one — if the Supreme Court rules against the administration, he absolutely will appoint more loyalist justices to the court (ie: court packing).   Some will say the constitutional basis for court packing is insufficient, but the door is open. In many ways this administration is looking to FDR as a model (ironically) as well as McKinley. FDR threatened to pack the court and succeeded at getting them to cede his demands.   One small detail is the Senate is supposed to advise and consent on Supreme Court appointments. So, to reduce chance of blowback, I expect the Supreme Court appointment(s) to happen before the midterms.   Although to be honest I don’t see Trump allowing a Dem majority to be seated in either house of congress. And if I’m right on that point — he will absolutely want the Supreme Court stacked well in his favor before the new congress is due to be sworn in.   The question of where a constitutional crisis begins is kind of academic, really. The real question is where does it end (ultimately, who wins)?  Btw Trump will also be looking to FDR as justification for serving more than two terms (never mind the fact FDR was the reason for the two term limit being created).",Fuck_the_Deplorables,2025-03-18T05:16:39,2
Currently the greatest crisis (IMHO) is how many Americans think Trump should be allowed to flaunt constitutional process freely just 'cause he's their boy.

"You can argue that there are not enough means to put the executive in check. Given that the executive branch had some of the broadest and most ill-defined authority in the constitution, if would have seemed prudent to have some ability to keep the executive from stepping all over the other branches based on its responsibilities to ""enforce"" the law. The line between ""enforce"" and ""interpret"" is easily crossed, which is the line between the executive and judicial branches.  The big gaping hole in the constitution and separation of powers you already brushed up against, but that is that the founders did not concern themselves deeply with the power of political alliances to prevent corrective action (political parties in this case). Maybe they thought the political process would provide enough variety in political opinions that there would not be this kind of loyalty to party before country or before constituents. They did not account for the power of media and propaganda to control a voting populace. Nor that participation in elections by those eligible to vote could be so damn low. Nor... many many things that they would have needed a crystal ball to predict...  IMHO, there needs to be an avenue for the voting populace to override whatever decisions are made by a bad-faith Congress, or a bad-faith judiciary. But I believe that whatever that looks, it needs to be very strongly and very clearly tied to the power of the people, that it has to be clearly a majority vote of some kind, and with no party or any other type of political alliance or apparatus able to interfere.

"You're correct, judges are not in a place to make laws. But, politics aside, the law you're referring to, the Alien Enemies Act ([50 USC Ch. 3](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter3&edition=prelim)) wasn't followed by the Executive Branch by any means.  The first sentence of the Alien Enemies Act states that it only applies when war has been declared, or when another government has invaded the U.S. Per [Article 1, Section 8](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C11-2-1/ALDE_00000110/), Congress and *only* Congress has the authority to declare war. Congress has not declared war against Venezuela, and thus the Executive Branch's actions are outside the scope of that statute.  If you go on to read the rest of the Alien Enemies Act, you'll notice that Section 23 explains the role of judges when the President exercises his authority under this Act. You'll note that the Act requires a judge to have a ""full examination and hearing"" on the issue. So let's backtrack and see if that was the case.  The Executive Branch rounded a number of Venezuelan immigrants up and deported them to El Salvador. A federal judge assigned to this issue submitted a TRO (which is a Temporary Restraining Order), telling the government to wait 14-days so a proper review, as required by the Alien Enemies Act, could be held. You can read the court docket entry for this case [here](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69741724/jgg-v-trump/). (Read through Docket Entry 16 for the TRO). But instead of following the procedures explicitly provided in the Act, the Executive Branch decided to go ahead with the deportations instead of allowing any form of examination and hearing, much less a ""full examination and hearing."" So no, the federal judge was not ""making laws"" in the case. In fact, he was trying to follow the procedures provided by the Alien Enemies Act. Sure, sometimes judges will try to improperly do so, but this is not one of those cases.   Even without getting into statutory readings, consider it from a logical perspective. Several people were rounded up, and the government has refused to provide any proof that they rounded up the correct people. The federal judge simply asked the government to wait 14 days before sending Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador. Isn't it worth waiting 2 weeks to make sure the people you're sending to prison are actually the violent gang members you say they are? Police serve warrants on incorrect addresses all the time. How are we so certain that the government hasn't made any mistakes this time around? Well unfortunately, we can't be, because the government has used the Alien Enemies Act to reason that they don't need to provide any details behind their arrests and deportations. Would I like to believe my government arrested the correct people? Of course. Do I blindly believe that my government never makes mistakes? No.   On a historical note, the last time the Alien Enemies Act was used was in 1941, when the Executive Branch rounded up American citizens of Japanese descent and threw them in internment camps.",3OttersInAnOvercoat,2025-03-18T23:51:16,1

The Secretary of State’s determination must be “facially legitimate and bona fide.” Id. at 847  The judge in that case, Maryann Trump Barry, found 241(a)(4)(C)(i) unconstitutional, though that ruling was reversed by a court of appeals for reasons unrelated to the constitutional issues, which the court of appeals did not address.  “Clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence” has not been shown in the matter of Khalil Mahmoud.

He was taken from his apartment by ICe agents, acting on order from the State Department to ‘remove his student visa’ even though he was in the US as a lawful permanent resident, not on a visa.

He was then transported from New York City to the LaSalle Detention Center in Jena, Louisiana. His lawyer and his wife were unaware of his whereabouts.    There were no criminal charges filed.  No allegations have been made that he engaged in any activity legally prohibited to U.S. residents.    Trump’s agents:  * entered a residence without a warrant * denied a person access to their lawyer * detained a person under false pretenses and without verifying their citizen status * attempted to deport a person without providing clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence  Under that same process *any* person could be removed from the country, effectively sentenced to hard work until death in an El Salvadoran prison camp.

You don't form a debate by suppressing criticism!  It's a tricky line to walk. We need criticism to improve, but in the current environment you have to be careful with the expression of it, or you may unwittingly become part of the problem. Take care to make it fact-based, avoid absolutist words like always and never that are usually a distortion for the sake of drama or an expression of emotions running high, and be sure to give credit where credit is due. Very similar to how you'd express disagreement with a spouse or life partner, incidentally.  And push back when you notice others slipping from those standards too, even when you largely agree with them.  Be mindful that to stop this administration, we will need to unite broadly with people across a wide political spectrum. It's ok to be angry with Democratic leaders right now and want new people in charge (which I think is inevitably going to happen given the will of the people to fight harder), but also remember that even as we push the current leaders aside, we need to act like a team and not fall into distracting in-fighting.",all_my_dirty_secrets,2025-03-17T07:36:37,4
