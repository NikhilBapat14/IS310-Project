"*From Gothamist reporter Caroline Lewis*  >New York Attorney General Letitia James and the attorneys general of 19 other states sued the Trump administration Monday to stop it from abruptly shrinking and restructuring the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, moves James said are “putting countless lives at risk.”  >The complaint argues that “dismantling” Health and Human Services is unconstitutional, and violates the Congressional mandates that established and funded its agencies and programs. The states are asking the court to block the administration from implementing a March 27 directive ordering mass layoffs and a departmental restructuring.  >“This administration is not streamlining the federal government,” James said in a statement on the lawsuit. “They are sabotaging it and all of us.”",GothamistWNYC,2025-05-05T12:16:57,7
