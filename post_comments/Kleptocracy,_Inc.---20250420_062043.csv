Republicans melted down over Obama wearing a tan suit but see no issue at all with Trump almost entirely abandoning the duties of the president to go golfing and kissing Saudi ass. And then they have the gall to call Democrats demented lol.,i_grad,2025-04-20T08:45:55,5
"Kleptocracy, Idiocracy, kakistocracy.  More corruption, less safety, less liberty, less trust, more fear, more poverty, more inequality, more repression.  The US is quickly adopting all of the worst political aspects of Russian, Soviet, and failed Latin American states. Honestly, after living in Latin America for several years it really feels to me like US politics and government is Latin Americanizing with the corruption, lack of faith in government, and hollowing out of social services that is soon becoming expected.   The US government is rotting away, slipping through the fingers of the American people until it’s nothing more than a vehicle for Trump and his cronies to enrich themselves and exact vengeance on anybody who stops them and scapegoat everybody else along the way.  If it’s a policy that led to the failure of a state, you can bet the Trump regime is going to adopt it.  Edit: just to be clear- there’s many wonderful things about Latin America, from the culture, people, etc. But the corrupt governments are not one of them.",triscuitsrule,2025-04-20T12:14:31,2
