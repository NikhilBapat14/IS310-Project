">Abbott could've called an election for the congressional seat to occur as soon as the next election in May; however, **the governor opted to drag his feet**, missing that deadline.   Well done, Houston Chronicle. Well done.",twirlingmypubes,2025-04-07T18:19:31,1

"Eight months after Turner's death, so his district's 800K constituents will go without representation in Congress for nearly half the term he was elected to. Also, it means eight months with the existing balance of power in the House, so eight more months of Democrats being basically frozen out of Congress. The odds that we'll still have a democracy by November are not 100%.",noncongruent,2025-04-07T20:05:00,1

He’s definitely rolling the election out slowly. He knows how to wheel and deal from the seat of power.,Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-04-07T19:48:43,1
