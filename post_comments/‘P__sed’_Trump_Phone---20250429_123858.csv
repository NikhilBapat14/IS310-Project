It’s not misleading. Trump got upset Amazon was talking about listing on your price at checkout how much you would be paying in tariffs specifically. Like let’s say you bought a $5.00 item and let’s say it’s from China. Now that item is going to cost $11.20. So it tells you that with your 124% tariff it’s going to increases the price from $5.00 to $11.20 at check out.,Demonking3343,2025-04-29T13:25:32,11

"In all fairness, I wouldn’t really expect them to get the “best” deals—it may be cynical, but that’s simply not how American companies work anymore. Consumers who wouldn’t otherwise think to research what deals are out there will be perfectly happy with the 20% off, so it just kind of makes sense for Honey to take advantage of that without going much further. If they make the best deals easily accessible, they risk getting crushed by the larger companies (off the top of my head, by making, say, the Sephora website incompatible with the Honey app). I had Honey a few years ago, and about once every 6 months it gave me an excellent deal I wouldn’t have otherwise found, but it just as often said there were NO available deals, even when the website itself was advertising a code. Horribly inconsistent, but it’s not like it costs anything. If people are using Honey and thinking it is always giving them the best option, that’s kinda on them.",Harmcharm7777,2025-04-29T15:24:06,-1
