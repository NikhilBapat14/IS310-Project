"If people want to be green, and I don't fault them for being environmental but why do they ignore the biggest go green opportunity there is.  Almost every plastic, every piece of paper and more can be made by Hemp.  Hemp Plastics have a shelf life of around 8-12 months in the landfill.      Hemp Paper can be processed to be white without having all the harsh chemicals needed for wood pulp to be white paper.  Hemp clothing is not the same coarse rough material your grandpa wore.  Biofuels      **Phytoremediation**: Hemp is used to clean contaminated soil and water by absorbing heavy metals and other pollutants.  Hemp wood, also known as HempWood, is nearly twice as strong as oak and can be cut, sanded, and finished like traditional hardwoods. It is made from hemp plant fibers compressed with a soy-based adhesive, and it has been developed to mimic the hardness, density, and stability of oak, making it a viable alternative for construction and furniture applications. It is resistant to insects as well as resistant to water and mold.  Hempcrete is a sustainable building material known for its numerous advantages. It is non-toxic, fire-retardant, and pest-resistant, making it a safe choice for construction. Hempcrete is also energy-efficient to produce and has a low carbon footprint, contributing to sustainable and environmentally friendly construction.  It also has good thermal and sound insulation properties.  Hemp takes around 100-120 days to fully mature. While it takes DECADES for Trees to grow to maturity and usefulness.      And so much more.  But no lets band plastic bags and leave all the other styrofoam and plastic covered products on the shelves.  So why aren't we taking advantage of this. This is the perfect marriage between environmentalism and capitalism.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T12:32:50,8
