Can't believe that there were some unions who supported Trump in spite of the fact that Trump and Elon were laughing at them getting fired.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-25T05:20:35,38
"The largest federal employee union, AFGE, is laying off more than half its staff—going from 355 workers to about 150. That means organizers, reps, and other key people are out, which seriously impacts how the union operates. This comes after years of financial strain, especially from the Trump administration’s efforts to weaken unions—like removing automatic dues deductions and cutting back on union rights.  Even though they tried to keep money coming in, it wasn’t enough. And now, they’re being forced to make huge cuts. The White House has even called AFGE a ""hostile"" force in government, and the Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of federal agencies, with Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leading the charge.  Meanwhile, unions and lawmakers are fighting back, trying to block these mass layoffs and protect civil service jobs. Lawsuits are flying, but the administration isn’t slowing down.",No_Wrangler8493,2025-04-25T05:00:37,18

They had the federal government paying for hundreds of full-time employees on top of taking in union dues.  They should have used the $15 million a year they got from just TSA to pay their employees instead of lobbying.  Maybe they could have move to e-dues sooner as well.,Locusts_Begone,2025-04-25T05:14:26,-20
