"TLDR:  * A bill proposed in the Indiana State Senate no longer requires consent to be taught as part of sex education. * The alterations on Senate Bill 442, which proposes a more regulated version of sexual education in Indiana, were made Monday, April 21 by State Sen. Gary Byrne, [*IndyStar*](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/21/indiana-general-assembly-bill-consent-human-sexuality-legislative-session/83193928007/) reported. Byrne noted that the choice to teach students about consent would be left to local school boards, to accommodate ""different thoughts in different communities."" * ""That \[consent education\] can still happen. We're not going to require it in this bill,"" Byrne said, per the outlet. ""This is a sensitive subject for many."" He added, ""This leaves, for the most part, local control on making those decisions.""",peoplemagazine,2025-04-24T11:00:05,6
"I… so they’re implicitly stating they want their girls to be raped, then? If they don’t want to teach the kids what consent even is it’s gonna be mighty hard for them to do things the right way.",KenUsimi,2025-04-24T12:26:35,5

"It's definitely a scam unless you actually buy or support the people running it. Can already tell you if you support them you get good reviews if you don't they will try to bash and censor anything you say.   They obviously only want there truth kinda like ABC. Sorry, but them trying to cancel Tim Allen they found out that their influence didn't go as far as they hoped. People is the same way. They are slowly learning the same thing alot of Actors And Actresses are learning. If you have real intelligence people are willing to listen. If not it becomes a Taylor Swift problem. You don't have ad much intelligence as you thought. So go back to singing and leave Polotics to people who know what they are doing.",Robroll8935,2025-04-24T17:29:49,1

"They are objectively the party of sexual assault. From trying to end no fault divorces to defending the church's infinite number of abuses to making sure that it's legal to marry a child in over 30 states, it's just the GOP way.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T19:24:03,2
I’m laughing at the part where he think it’s up to local schools to decides. MAGA had been the most nationalism I had ever seen since Bush Jr. era.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T11:50:16,3
