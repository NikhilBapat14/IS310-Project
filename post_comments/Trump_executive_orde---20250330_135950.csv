"The Founders never anticipated that the legislative branch could be so supine and obsequious to a president.   If we manage to make it past Trump, we'll need a constitutional amendment or two to plug loopholes.",clamorous_owle,2025-03-30T14:09:00,4
This whole system was not set up to handle someone doing all this.  He will keep trying and trying changing the law bit by bit until the bits pass which allow them other bits to be attempted until they pass and so on until he has it all,Electronic-Sun-8275,2025-03-31T02:19:47,2

Political parties aren’t in the constitution. That’s a pretty major flaw.,GronklyTheSnerd,2025-03-30T14:47:26,2
We have to break the right first.  Can you imagine a constitutional convention if they got their way?,Za_Lords_Guard,2025-03-30T15:33:11,1
"While there are certainly loyalist to Trump, the more and more I read about it the more and more it seems that Congressional Republicans are simply more worried about losing in 2026 if they challenge Trump too much.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T12:02:24,1
"They know there will be litigation and push back.  The entire strategy is anchored on overwhelming the opposition so that they need to pick and choose which cases to take to court, and of those that do make it to court, can get tied up.  In the meantime, it can boil down to 'Okay, so the courts are saying that what we did was illegal, so okay, we will stop doing the thing but the reality is that it is too late to reverse what has already been done.'  I mean, for those who have been deported, who is going to track them down and bring them back?  For unions that have been busted, how can they be brought back under the current Admin?  And so on.   For the rest of their policies, they are essentially just throwing spaghetti at a wall to see which noodles stick.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T12:26:29,2
"The 'normal' way:  You first need 2/3s of the House and 2/3s of the Senate to agree.  Then, 75% of States must agree, or, 38 out of the 50 States.  The 'Constitutional Convention' way:  You first need 34 States to agree on the amendment.  Then, you need 38 States to 'vote yes'.  Obviously, there would not be enough Congressional votes to pass Congress the normal way.  For the Convention route, and these are only estimates, there are 16 deep red States,  6 -8 red States, and  8 - 10 purple States, and assuming that no blue State would go for it, that leaves between 30 - 34 States that would vote yes assuming that all, including the purple States, vote in favor. They won't get 4 blue States to sign on and the purple States are hit or miss.   So, if it is related to Trump's agenda, it is not going to happen.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T12:16:45,1
