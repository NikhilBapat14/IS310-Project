"Don't even need the polls.   More people voted against him than for him, so, he himself didn't even get a majority.  >though US President Donald Trump repeatedly promoted his 2024 victory as a mandate—to inflate the actual degree of voter support—he failed to receive 50% of the popular vote. His 1.5 percentage point margin of victory in 2024 place it in only the 20th percentile of presidential elections since 1828.  Plurality not majority. 3rd party voters didn't want him or Harris.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_(politics)",nerphurp,2025-05-04T19:03:45,138

The damn 2024 vote totals have never been such that Trump has a mandate. He has never gotten a majority of votes cast and in 2024 the most popular voting option for Americans was to not vote.   Biden had a much bigger public mandate than Trump by literally every single metric. Trumps entire Regime is built on gaslighting. Shit his entire political career is built on gaslighting. Remember he started all of this by calling Obama citizenship into question. ,SpicyButterBoy,2025-05-05T05:22:02,2

The more viable candidates you have, the more likely it is that the winner will get a plurality but not a majority (e.g. Bill Clinton, John F. Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln).  Trump's mandate comes from the fact that he was elected *again* when it was abundantly clear exactly what his agenda was.

"Electoral College representatives are allocated based on the number of representatives a state has in the House, which is roughly by population. But only roughly, so some states with low populations have disproportionately high EC votes. That’s problem 1.  Problem 2 is that the EC is a winner-take-all system (with two or three modest exceptions). That means that all of a state’s EC votes go towards whatever candidate wins a majority in that state.  As a result of this, close elections boil down to winning small margins in a small number of closely-contested “swing” states. So a relatively small number of voters end up deciding the election.  To be fair to Trump and the process, he DID win every one of the swing states in this election. But to be fair to the rest of humanity, that was not a wide margin, it cannot be reasonably construed as a “mandate,” and what he’s doing now is going to cause a recession and inflation, which is what he criticized Biden/Harris for.",CaptLatinAmerica,2025-05-05T07:43:01,3
