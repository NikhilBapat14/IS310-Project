"You either like Machiavelli or hate him. So you either think that being *effective* at achieving your policy goals is more important than being moral, or you think this is a horrible idea and the ends never justify the ends.   If you go with the Machiavellian approach, the guy's a Saint. If not, he's Satan.",[deleted],2022-08-19T17:30:32,34
"First, I want to challenge your methodology. You seem to prefer a “balanced perspective” in analyzing Kissinger. This is a fallacy. Balanced perspectives have to minimize the extremist elements of their subjects in order to provide a seemingly balanced perspective. If you want a truly balanced perspective, I would suggest that you should be reading the most pro-Kissinger works (presumably those written by the man himself, like you have done) and compare them to the most anti-Kissinger works, such as Hitchens. Look for the inaccuracies between the extremes and let that reveal the “balanced” perspective.   I’ll also second the suggestion to check Behind the Bastards. The host is an experienced journalist who draws from many sources. Even if you don’t agree with his analysis, you can check his sources and make your further determinations.   I’ll also suggest the book that propelled Kissinger to fame among reactionaries “Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy.” Published in 1957, Kissinger rejected the Eisenhower-ian theories of nuclear deterrence and instead advocated lfor the use of tactical nuclear weapons. His policies on nuclear actions would have likely ended humanity as we know it almost two generations ago.   He was a power-hungry opportunist who made the decision to burn hundreds of thousands of people alive. The fact that he still lives a comfortable life is proof, in of itself, that we do not live in a universe that cares about justice.",jaycrips,2022-08-19T18:45:50,33
"I am not the person to ask, because Viet Nam and Cambodia were a huge influence on my social & political views, even to this day. Kissinger does not deserve my respect, period. He has not done anything to change my mind about him being a dishonest, power-hungry, sad excuse for a human being. The blood of a generation is dripping off his fingers.",GrandmaDynette,2022-08-19T15:26:52,37

"Hmmm, thinking back 36 years, he was defending his warhawk mentality, might makes right, the only good defense is a strong offense and proactive military vision of international relations. If I recall correctly, he justified using nuclear weapons as a deterrent and a deterrent is only effective if you actually would engage in any threat. I didn't have very strong beliefs nor understanding of politics and still knew in my bones, he was wrong.",bcbamom,2022-08-20T17:25:07,3
"Cold War history is very interesting because it's one of the time periods that *really* changes with hindsight. During Nixon's era, the US was considered to be in an existential battle of social philosophy. Just even writing that phrase today seems melodramatic. But how could Nixon and Kissinger know that in just 2 decades the USSR would collapse in upon itself? Kissinger's pressures were almost unparalleled in human history. To what degree that absolve him of the weight of his choices?  There isn't a definitive answer here. Some folks think Kissinger is a horrible murderer with no redeeming qualities whose aggression and ruthlessness nearly ended the world. Some folks don't entirely disagree with that but argue that such a perspective was reasonable for the time and possibly even a good thing given the needs of the situation. I don't think anyone really feels he was a good and moral actor who was concerned by human suffering.  Where you land on this spectrum is really up to you. I can tell you that as time moves on and the fear of losing the Cold War is increasingly in the past, more and more historians have less and less good to say about Kissinger. I personally feel the realpolitik argument is significantly weakened by the Cuban Missile Crisis. The CMC was the single most tense and dangerous point of the Cold War, and it was the situation that called for realpolitik more than any other, and it was still resolved peacefully and with reasonable diplomacy. If the CMC could be resolved without Kissinger's brand of ""bomb first and ask questions later"" then I'm pretty sure all of Kissinger's crises could have as well.  A big part of getting a really good answer to this question is to look beyond *just* Kissinger. Much of Kissinger's actions were justified by ""well, if we lose here then the USSR gets an advantage and then we're *really* screwed"" and if we then later see the USSR getting an advantage and we're not really screwed...then that kinda makes Kissinger's approach suspect.",mormagils,2022-08-22T09:25:30,3

"If I had to do a TL;DR of Kissinger I'd say ""political and personal self-interest to the point of sociopathy.""  I think his endorsement of ideas of realpolitik do make sense from a mechanistic perspective but they seem to be pretty detached from any real conception of *people* as they exist. The through line that stands out for me in a lot of his writing and work seems to be this fundamental disconnect between *humanity* as a concept and *people.*  He can grasp the idea of humanity as a whole but a lot of his actual ideas and advice seem to forget that there are actual people involved. It's a bit much to do a retrospective of his entire career in a reddit comment but there are notable instances where decisions about political maneuvering was made with seeming indifference to the effect it would have on people that Kissinger was not personally accountable to.  His involvement with the Bangladesh Liberation War and support of Yahya Kahn, his support for Argentine's Dirty War and the military coup that followed the murder of Allende in Chile, his support of Suharto in East Timor, his advocating to essentially start a war with Cuba, and his comments about Jews being persecuted in the Soviet Union (""[...]if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern."") are some highlights but a lot of the Nixon administration's bloodiest times have Kissinger usually somewhere near the top of the decision tree.  His more contemporary analysis is....questionable.  He vocally supported the invasion of Iraq, criticizing the Bush administration for not sending *enough* troops in. I'm not sure if he's ever reversed course on that. He's very supportive of friendly relations with China and having that without focusing on China's actions towards domestic ethnic minorities or saber rattling towards Japan. He's been a proponent of the ""Ukraine should negotiate with Russia"" line since the renewed hostilities to the point that Ukraine should accept the loss of Crimea and the Donbas.  The idea of a dual or multi-polar political world order being better than a unipolar one is a position that can be argued for but I question how much interrogating of that concept Kissinger has done in light of history since that time.  He's not ideologically extreme but he is pragmatic and while pragmatism has its uses, it *is* possible to be pragmatic to the point of monstrous inhumanity and Kissinger definitely spent some time on the ""monstrous inhumanity"" side of that line during his career.  There's a four part series of the podcast ""Behind The Bastards"" devoted to Kissinger. I wouldn't take it as supremely historically authoritative but it gives a *very* thorough run-down of a lot of things Kissinger was involved in that make people hate him today and it provides a multitude of jumping off points for further research.",HeloRising,2022-08-20T04:59:41,5

I hated when my college invited him to speak in the early 80s. I was uninformed then and listening to him made my skin crawl. His unapologetic war mongering was abhorrent even then.,bcbamom,2022-08-19T20:45:47,3
"Kissinger's ideology could be summed up as ""the US should stop trying to fight communism on every front and focus only on the areas that are vital to trade and resources.""  When Kissinger rose to prominence, the primary foreign policy of the US was Containment; fighting communism everywhere in the world with military force. This policy led to the unpopular Vietnam War, which hurt American legitimacy. Kissinger sought to end the wars against communism and instead try to drive a wedge between the Soviet Union and China. He instead wanted to focus on the regions where the US needed resources.  Realigning the foreign policy of the United States in such a drastic way meant that he ended a lot of wars and started a lot of wars. He abandoned allies and allied with some bad actors to keep access to vital resources.  He treated the Cold War as a struggle for global resources rather than an ideological crusade and made calculated moves to secure resources while cutting the USSR off from resources.  From a modern foreign policy perspective, Kissinger had the wrong idea about international relations and a lot of people died due to decisions he made and influenced, but he was orders of magnitude less wrong than his predecessors who would keep fighting ""Vietnam War"" scale conflicts until every commie was dead. Kissinger was the start of putting actual experts in charge of foreign policy, even if his expertise was in an academic school of thought that was outdated even in his time.",Volsunga,2022-08-20T12:08:28,2
"Kissinger was a fascist Jew - yes they do exist in spite of the negative experience Jews have had with authoritarianism and fascism. He believed in societal stratification and “inferior peoples.” He used his influence to harm vulnerables, not elevate them - a truly conceited, self absorbed narcissist.",stevmg,2022-08-19T18:32:51,4
"Like him or hate him he is an inspiring story of a talented, supremely intelligent and patriotic immigrant and veteran able to advise leaders from presidents to military leadership on accomplishing strategic objectives. He didn’t keep his Nobel money and he did deserve credit for his dual Nixon-reality peace strategy with Vietnam.   He had the misfortune of being influential during a time many Americans woke up from blind trust of their government. Some of his positions therefore are infamous despite every national security advisor and Secretary of State doing the same things and same errors before and after.   He believes in saving face and can be an unfeeling foreign policy. That doesn’t mean he’s evil. He is actually responsible intentionally or not for more peace strategies than many I can think of. Iranian nukes and the impact of ISIS on Iranian strategy, Ukrainian objectives, NATO intervention in Serbia, nuclear disarmament, avoiding an expensive and dangerous Chinese Cold War, criticism of Iraq administration, the opportunity of detente for China-Russia… he’s just usually right.   There’s no way he could’ve known China would be the superpower it is today. Russia was. China had nukes but it was second fiddle. He recognizes it today.   He doesn’t say Russia wanted to elect Trump; he says it wanted to harm Clinton to hurt the US. He slow rolled nuclear directives and he discouraged arming Israel with any dual use systems 13 years after it lied to US inspectors and made a nuclear program. He was more than willing to keep south Vietnam as less than a pawn to avoid soviet influence on US Asian policy. He believed then and today that Pakistan is a critical ally even as it was destroying East Pakistan. So was India. Same logic different outcome: we were supported of national apartheid until Kissinger stamped it out in Rhodesia and thus Rhodesia.   And he continued the underhanded measures Nixon’s administration perfected by undermining Carter. He undermined Nixon in Yom Kippur because Nixon just wasn’t a great negotiator and was interfering with Israeli progress. He urged to continue the Vietnam war and couldn’t do it, thankfully. But he also followed reality. Nixon was going to bomb Cambodia. He was opposed then he wasn’t because opposition wouldn’t convince Nixon. He wanted more limited Israeli aid because the US was liable for oil, and indeed it suffered when Nixon went bananas with aid. Yet he laid the groundwork for Egypt to be a bedrock ally at the same time.   Many talk about South America: can we get more Kissinger than supporting dictators yet also getting the Panama Canal Zone? He was for warmer Cuban relations but kept civil wars across Africa active because there would be no relations if Cubans supported separatists.   And he was wrong like everyone else. He didn’t feel much passion about soviet Jews which is strange, other than he felt it jeopardizes national interests. He relied on Iran as an anchor because foreign wars were a thing of the past. Well that didn’t work well. He supported ill fated “quick” evil actions like Indonesia that killed hundreds of thousands. He didn’t say do it, he said make it quick and end your war.   And he’s a businessman. Who isn’t? Like Albright was, national security advisors and Secretaries of State get to know a lot of people and consider complex problems people, universities and businesses face. Can that be surprising or a real point of contention?  Kissinger is a genius. He is a patriot. He was just born in the wrong time when the public didn’t submit to every government strategy. All people of that era looked evil and stupid because at times, they were. But to deny his contributions to American and international interest is not honest. I disagree with him on a lot, but I also don’t. His brand is as relevant and potentially useful today at 99 as it was when he was in the Kennedy administration even if individual parts were truly despicable.",[deleted],2022-08-19T23:19:45,-3
"Whatever you read, don't let it be something that focuses on the asian conflicts while ignoring global politics. Kissinger's strategy was to separate China from the USSR for cold war purposes, and then the rest was cleaning up the pieces in Asia. If ending the nuclear standoff was a good thing, you have to then consider if (1) all the rest was worth it, and (2) if you would have had better solutions, not in hindsight, which is the way a lot of keyboard warriors view history, but if you were in the same.olace at the same time with the same information.",[deleted],2022-08-20T10:32:39,0

"I don't think anyone can be so simply categorized. This is no defense of him or others but the sheer complexity of the job of SoS requires an individual to be more complex than that. From what I've seen, there is a lot of hate for him, but a lack of fervent defenders (think MAGA type). This suggests to me that he operated on a different level than cults of personality do. I get the sense that more sophisticated political types have a more nuanced feel for him aside from love/hate. Lots of gray area.",gomi-panda,2022-08-19T17:43:53,-8

"Thanks for this perspective. I'm not intimately familiar with Kissinger's thinking. From what you shared, it implies there is a consensus forming as time goes on that K's strategy was extreme and lacking in compassion, and lacked the realpolitik practiced during the CMC. Did I get that right?  Supporters of Kissinger note that even today his support or critique of a policy remains prescient and usually correct; I can't speak to that but wonder what your opinion is.",gomi-panda,2022-08-22T19:35:17,1

"Thank you. This is the sort of response I was hoping to hear. you provided a specific situation, explained his decision as well as the opposing one and the fallout of such decisions. This is in line with the realpolitik focus of his policies.   I do not see him as an evil man, nor one without flaws. I see him as a person who coolly assesses a situation and determines the best course of action towards reaching an objective. I am not in his mind yet in terms of whether or not he is someone with fundamental principles such as peace and justice, but I hope to get my foot in the door after reading his books.",gomi-panda,2022-08-19T23:34:27,1
"He's fairly straightforward. He wanted a unified Italy, preferred Republics to monarchies, and didn't like using mercenaries.   However, he understood that acting a moral way all the time, or even refusing to compromise a principle to achieve a greater goal, could let you fail at what you wanted most.   Take the unified Italy idea- it's in The Prince. Machiavelli noted that England, France, and Spain all unified under monarchies, while the Republics of Italy squabbled and remained separated. So, book of advice for a monarch it is- toss the lesser good for the greater, and don't cry about it.   Shortest version, if you won't do the acts to achieve your goals, don't pick those goals.",[deleted],2022-08-20T11:29:25,2
"Most of the MAGA types have no idea who he is/was.  They know vaguely that he was in Nixon's cabinet and that Trump said nice things about him.  I'd eat my belt with barbecue sauce if you went to a Trump rally and found anyone who could talk in any meaningful detail about Kissinger's career.  Kissinger didn't really form a ""personality cult"" per say. There are a lot of people who like his ideas but the man himself isn't super partisan so he's hard to form a distinct fanbase around. He's useful as a figurehead for more conservative or hawkish politics but the man himself isn't that polarized hence why you rarely hear from him directly.",HeloRising,2022-08-20T05:07:02,12
"""Gray area"" is not a thing you'll find in great quantity on the internet- it's the moral equivalent of armchair quarterbacking, done by people who don't have to make those complicated decisions.

H.K. did whatever he could do advance is own personal career at the expense of anything else there wasn't anything sophisticated behind that. His actions were often manipulative and he had unchecked power for some time. There's plenty to learn from how he did things (to prevent it from happening again). To come away thinking he was a good guy or morally neutral at best when he's basically a war criminal and traitor to the US public seems like you don't understand the greater picture of what he did. It doesn't take a master mind to get things done when nobody is holding you accountable.,jsblk3000,2022-08-20T10:21:03,5
"I apologize if I wasn’t clear.   The most pro-Kissinger works will either minimize or outright ignore the evil he did. The most anti-Kissinger work will emphasize the evil and minimize or ignore the good. By reading the polar opposites, you have a much better chance of learning objective truths, at least in my opinion.   As far as Kissinger’s hunger for power? He aligned himself with the powerful political majority of the day and switched sides any time they lost power.   He aligned with conservatives in the 50’s, liberals in the early 60’s, and conservatives again in the late 60’s into the 70’s. He also likely aided Nixon in undermining Johnson’s peace talks in the late 60’s by helping promise the Southern Vietnamese that Nixon would get them a better deal than Johnson.",jaycrips,2022-08-19T19:19:33,23
"Honestly, before I get into too much detail about Kissinger I really should brush up on him again. It's been a little while since I've focused on him specifically. Fortunately the book I'm rereading now has pretty good section on him.  But broadly, I would say you summed up the forming consensus pretty well. For example, one thing that sticks out for Kissinger is his response to the Seven Day War. Kissinger (and the United States) was highly pro-Israel in that conflict. While that's perfectly fine, the US being very ""sidey"" in that war helped to reinforce the geopolitical fault lines in the region that to this day makes that an area of interest (not in a good way) for US foreign policy. Would it have been better if the US was a bit more open to working with Egypt instead of treating it as a threat because of its communist-curious stance? It's worth considering.  So yeah, I guess, Kissinger was ""correct"" in that Israel is today a strong US ally and Egypt is not...but that's a bit ignoring the process for the result. There was a time that France was communist-curious, too. We ""solved"" that problem by giving them a buttload of money for free. But Kissinger *clearly* favored Israel over Egypt and pretty much didn't see an alliance or growing positive relationship with Egypt as a top US priority. Imagine if we were able to really capitalize on Sadat and have our warming relations extend into the Mubarak era. We could have had a much different present.",mormagils,2022-08-23T09:01:29,2
