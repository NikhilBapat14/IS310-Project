The Laken Riley Act which was signed into law allows deportation based on accusations of committing a crime, bypassing due process and ethical codes. The president already has deportation authority, and his use of the Alien Enemies Act makes zero sense considering that they're stating most of the people were already here illegally which leads me to believe this is part of a larger scheme. I mean not one lawyer tried to even use the Laken Riley Act as an argument I mean they could be complete idiots but.....  no actually that one checks too   I'm sure Laken Riley is thrilled that her life which included the ANA ethical code of avoiding harm, is being used this way.

In one case the person had ID on him and kept telling the officers he is born in the US. They still drove him around for hours and found his ID on him when processing him 10 hours later.

"> The obvious next step is ""deporting"" a citizen, which I do not doubt will happen. They are testing the waters. But it doesn't seem like they've crossed the line... Yet.  There's lots of speculation about this. The thing to watch for is if people who are full-blooded Americans to the bone are dealing with overseas incarceration (I know it's semantics, but ""deportation"" is not the correct term in the context here when talking about any random person who has no ties to anywhere outside the US).  But I think people will be in for a rude awakening should the people getting deported aren't named something like Jorge, Maria, or Pablo, but instead, something like Nathan, Brandon, Zach, Jackie, etc. A lot of people see a foreign-sounding name and tune it out. It won't capture attention until it's a very American sounding name, and the people being led face down by Salvadorean guards in are actually Americans that wouldn't be mistaken for anyone else....  It will be a different ball game when people are being sent to El Salvador that have no ties outside the US, people's whos ancestors immigrated from Poland, present-day Germany, Ireland, etc., way back in the day and arrived at Coney Island, people who don't speak a lick of Spanish, etc.",Vlad_Yemerashev,2025-04-01T11:18:27,7

"Its the question that was asked of me.   so I answered that question.  If we just looked at who in the world has it worse off than US citizens we would then try to migrate  a few billion people in, which would make life shitty here.  trying to create a migration policy off of compassion is a bad idea, because there will always be more people you weren't compassionate too.       instead we should look at the impact on US citizens.

"Yes back when immigrants were settlers we took everyone.  people getting off a boat and having to physical build a house from scratch and start farming.    And back when people landed with nothing  and walked around to find a job, when manual labor jobs were a plenty that style of migration served us well.      But the conditions are different now, and how quickly, or slowly we build houses is way different.  LA fires were 3 months ago and the very first building permits are just now being issued.      Mass migration in the settler era meant mass rising of houses and new farms popping up with in 3 months.      mass migration now means cities rent out hotels and apartments and use tax payer dollars to fund it.   migrants then start competing (through no fault of their own) with Americans to rent apartments, rising the prices.      Its not nearly as beneficial now as it was in the 1700s.  and much more externalities are thrust upon Americans now than ever before.

"So he recieved a conditional green card November 2024 and was still within his two year window. That is a detail I was not aware of. I think the argument that this is a temporary status is questionable. It is, as you said, a ""conditional permanent"" residency. ""Permanent"". But the ""conditional"" part might be relevant.   If the green card was granted based on certain conditions (e.g., marriage to a US citizen, investment), and the conditions are not met, they can revoke the green card. However, this doesn't apply in Khalil's case as far as I can see. He also wasn't at the end of the 2 year window, so this isn't about that process of removing the conditions and obtaining unconditional permanent resident status.   Green card holders can definitely be deported if they are convicted of a crime. Khalil is not, at this time, facing criminal charges though, and has certainly not been convicted.   Originally they claimed his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S. This is such a niche piece of immigration law that I cannot tell what due process would mean in this context. However, the courts said there was not sufficient due process in the government's present actions and he was not eligible for deportation.   After that court case, the administration pivoted, and now the primary argument being made that he lied on his application, concealing details about his affiliation to certain groups that would have barred him for receiving the green card. If this is true, it would be grounds to revoke his green card. But his green card hasn't been revoked and the burden is on the government to prove in an immigration court that he lied and his affiliation with Palestinian groups would have been disqualifying. They can't just deport him prior to doing those steps.   This information is helpful in clarifying why news sources of different leanings can't seem to agree on Khalil's status. But there isn't actually a difference as far as I can see. There is still a burden of proof and a requirement for due process that is being sidestepped.",xtaberry,2025-04-01T13:54:06,4

"So before the Biden era style of funding their travel, housing, food, clothing, and cell phones.       I've seen studies that claim they add, and studies that claim they take away.      Web AI sums it up pretty well :   >Studies on the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have yielded mixed results. Some studies indicate that immigrants, particularly those with low levels of education and income, can impose a heavier tax burden on natives at the state and local levels due to their larger families and higher use of public K-12 education services.  >However, other research suggests that immigrants, especially those with higher education levels, are net positive contributors to the federal budget. Over the long term, the upward economic mobility and taxpaying lifetime of second-generation immigrants more than offset the initial fiscal burden.

"There's a ton of conditions, not just stay married.      Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act that authorizes the nation's top diplomat to revoke the visas of foreign national students on the grounds that their presence or activities have ""**potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences"" for the U.S.**     Green card applicants must **demonstrate their allegiance to the United States by supporting and defending the principles of the Constitution.**     * Follow all federal, state, and local laws * File U.S. income tax returns * **Support democracy** * Alert the USCIS of any change in addres    It could have been argued that by expressing support for Hamas, who hasn't held elections since winning power in 2006, he's not supporting democracy.
