"*player complains they would have won if only the refs didn’t give the game to their opponent*  Shut up, hand leadership over to a younger generation, and be quiet. We do not need another Hillary running around doing “I told you so” speeches.    None of this helps anyone anywhere other than to keep you in the spotlight.  You were a lawyer right? Why not work with some law groups or unite a bunch of dem lawyers to start launching every lawsuit imaginable at the trump administration, or delays things through appeals in court?     Stop talking and DO something",Lucky-old-boy,2025-05-01T09:12:22,8

"Finger pointing is not an *alternative policy*.  Not a single alternative proposal was made in that 94-second clip.  That is what turned me off in the 2024 election -- Harris constantly poopooed on Trump and asked for money.  I didn't see her say, ""Mindraker, here are my ideas that will benefit YOU.""",Muenrabbit,2025-05-01T07:51:35,0
