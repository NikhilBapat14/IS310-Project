"""The IRS code prevents presidents from interfering with the federal tax agency’s decisions, raising questions about whether Trump’s Friday announcement stemmed from his own decision-making or a reference to the end of the independent agency’s review.""  Trump just says shit and still doesn't understand how the federal government works. Before even reading that I had doubts that a president could just say, ""I don't like that school, tax them"".",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T08:27:28,20

so do we know if he applied to harvard and was rejected?  Is that why he has such a raging obsession with the place?,keyjan,2025-05-02T08:27:29,2

"We can set aside notions of what the Executive Branch can do legally.  We're well past that point.  I do think Trump is making a mistake here, for a different reason.  He tends to go after the more vulnerable prey to show the stronger what he will do.  Take the trans community, for example.  With education, he's going after the strongest and that will likely result in less secure institutions following their lead.    Harvard understands that bending the knee will not result in the regime moving along.  In fact it makes it worse (see Columbia).  So you refuse, lawyer up, play the delay game Trump knows all too well, and survive until sanity is restored to DC.  Trump is using every lever he has to get Harvard to capitulate.  He's picked the wrong target.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-02T08:34:00,2
"4 of the Supreme Court justices graduated from Harvard.  I wonder if they, or the numerous former Harvard lawyers who are now Congressmen, will speak up about this.   Then again, Donald Trump supposedly graduated UPenn with a bachelors in economy and doesn’t seem to know how tariffs work.",DramaticWesley,2025-05-02T09:25:41,2

"The only way this works out for Trump is if the corruption is so deep that he’s guaranteed a win.  Picking a legal fight with what some consider the best law school on earth that has almost an unlimited cash reserve and an extremely proud, extremely smart pool of alumni might not work out well. He really doesn’t know how to recognize when he’s in a position of weakness.",hmr0987,2025-05-02T09:35:17,1

"Nothing surprising here. This is the most Trump-move ever: Destruction of all forms of education + Destruction of the first amendment. If this doesn’t sound like the US is turning into a police state with no freedom of speech and no education centres that allow opposing views, then you need a wake up call and maybe even an education again.",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-02T08:28:41,0
"That would hurt Democrats far more than Republicans.  Black churches are hugely effective turnout machines and the lynchpin to Democrat statewide victories in the purple states with substantial black population - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia - which account for six Democrats in the Senate.",PlusGoody,2025-05-02T09:34:13,0
No he just doesnt care how the govt works. And he doesnt care to learn either. Thats what makes him so god damn awful. If it was just a simple misunderstanding it wouldnt be so infuriating.,[deleted],2025-05-02T08:47:04,6
"Keep in mind that Trump v. US said that all investigation and prosecution, as well as all executive power belongs to the president alone. So that part of IRS code is unconstitutional in light of SCOTUS precedents, and that is why Trump is ignoring it. For same reason he is ignoring law that prevented him from instantly firing Inspector Generals and such.",BlockAffectionate413,2025-05-02T15:50:50,1

> would hurt Democrats far more than Republicans  Black voters in 2024 were [11% of the voting public](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/exit-polls?amp=1).  You're arguing the effect of church political advocacy for Democrats in 11% of the population vs. the effect of church political advocacy for Republicans in the 71% of the non-Latino white voting population *and* the 11% of the Latino voting population.,reckless_commenter,2025-05-02T16:32:31,1
"""he just doesnt care how the govt works. And he doesnt care to learn either.""  Exactly why he struggled to actually get stuff done during his first term. It is frustrating, I agree.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T08:53:41,3

And he's for a bunch of a** kissers in the office that allowing him to do it too. Did you see his cabinet meeting recently? Those people are so far up his a** you could see them poking out of his mouth when he talked.,NoPomegranate4794,2025-05-02T08:57:20,3
"A lot of these ""ignored laws"" are still in legal limbo and I am hoping for the people doing illegal stuff on Trumps behalf getting thrown in jail.  Obviously he isn't the one personally doing tax audits, but somebody is, and that person needs to answer for it if a federal court ruled against it. People talk about Trump like he is Lex Luther, but I don't think for a second most of his supporters would die or go to jail for him. The inbred January 6ers would, but that is not the typical government employee.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T16:02:36,2
"ahhhh good point.  He's a freshman at NYU. So, 19 maybe?

"I hope so too.  Harvard has money, connections, Harvard Law, etc.  If any institution can stand up against the regime, they've what you need to do so.  The game now isn't to defeat an authortarian regime.  That's up to the people.  For Harvard, it's obstruct and delay.  The goal is survival.

Well Trump has been ignroed lot of laws that are fully legitimate and courts are rightly striking that down. My point was only about ability of president to direct any executive agency to do something within their power.,BlockAffectionate413,2025-05-02T16:08:16,1
