"In general, it's financially advantageous for most clients in civil suits to settle. Trials are expensive. They take a lot of time for lawyers, paralegals, and other staff. It requires a lot of legwork and filing paperwork. And then you leave it up to a jury (or sometimes a judge) to make a decision.  It's almost always cheaper to settle a civil lawsuit. Your lawyer is supposed to look out for your best interest, which includes your financial position.  In this case it appears that the law firm thought they would lose clients faster (and thus lose money) by fighting the government than by settling.   The real focus here should be that the government put a private law firm in that position in the first place, not how the law firm responded.",BaaBaaTurtle,2025-05-09T09:03:33,8

Oh yeah, he also has a long history of convincing his lawyers to do illegal things on his behalf.   Trump has always undermined the legal system, both as a private citizen and now as president. The only difference now is that his actions can literally unmake the system. The good news is, the best lawyers see what he is about and are refusing to help or actively resisting.

"Yes but Donald Trump is literally the client they teach you in law school to avoid at all costs.   He is dumb. He is emotional. He is impetuous. He always believes he knows better than the professionals he hires. He doesn't pay for services.   Like you couldn't possibly ask for a worse client. It's not about the crimes he commits, it is how stupidly he commits them.   During Trump's first term, Trump's attorney on the Mueller case went to Robert Mueller and argued that Donald Trump is so stupid, that if Mueller put him on the stand it would constitute a national security crisis because other nations would realize that it's not jsut an act, Donald Trump cannot maintain focus or emotional stability for even five minutes in order to save his own ass from jail.   And even though Mueller should have never tolerated that bullshit argument, the lawyer wasn't necessarily wrong.   Any time Trump has been on the stand he's proven to be too much of a petulant, brain-addled little bitch to even lie straight enough to save himself.   This is often what I point to as evidence that Donald Trump truly is mentally unwell. A sociopathic liar can easily stand up on a witness stand and deliver pre-prepared lies to save themselves.
