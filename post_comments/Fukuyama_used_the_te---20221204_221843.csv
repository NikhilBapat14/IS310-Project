"Hey! It has been a few years since reading Political Order and Political Decay, but I will attempt a response surrounding what he is describing.    When Fukuyama discusses the formation of the modern state, he is describing the move from tribal-level societies to formation of state and evolution from Patrimonial State to Modern States. In the development of the Modern State the concept of National Development is employed. This encompasses three pillars, per say, that can occur by themselves but shouldn’t for the optimal development to occur: Economic Growth, Social Mobilization, and Political Development. Fukuyama measures historical economic growth based on the industrialization of a society. With industrialization, there should be an increase in entrepreneurship, income, and industrial output. These increases ideally increase Social Mobilization, or the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Within Political Development there are three additional subgroups: State Building, Rule of Law, and Accountability. All of which develop individually over time. Roughly, his theory states that economic growth increases social mobilization, leading to more political participation. To restrict the state from suffering from political decay, there also needs to be Political Development in the subgroup areas that coincides with increases in either economic growth or social mobilization.  Italy developed its current multi-party parliamentary republic after the ‘fall of fascism’. In the implementation of this electoral system, there was an immediate increase in social mobilization of the population. This is the “Modernization” of the political structure. Now focusing on Southern Italy and clientelism: there was increase in the economic investment by the state. The goal of the state was to utilize the modernized political system to industrialize the economy via the disbursement of state funds based on the needs of the localities articulated by the elected officials who now represent the population. Intended Goal: Political Development -> Social Mobilization -> Economic Growth -> Political development, etc. a positive feedback loop. However, due to clientelism and patronage, personal interests and personal relationships were prioritized over the will of the population participating in the political system, and all the benefits of economic growth and social mobilization were restricted by the lack of political development in the areas of accountability and rule of law.  Southern Italy experienced economic growth, without the positive increases in income, entrepreneurship, or economic output. Southern Italy saw increased social mobilization through participation in elections and representation at a national level without increasing the participation in a joint interest of ideology. Southern Italy modernized its political and economic system, but did not develop the political structures necessary for optional National Development, thus, Southern Italy experienced “Modernization Without Development”.  I hope this helps, was fun to engage in this, and I am happy to talk further.",WiscoBro,2022-12-05T16:32:51,4
"Thank you! Yes, this was very helpful, and puts a finer point to what I understood from Fukuyama. If I were to simplify and summarize, ""Modernization"" is the modernizing of the state's economy and political institutions, while ""Development"" is the continual development and engagement of various social classes into the political system.  So while Italy has on its surface the face of a modernized democracy, clientelism prevents the populace from truly voting their interests.   This is fascinating stuff and illuminates the current issues facing Italy and Greece, and potentially other countries. I just started the section on the issues with the US government, which too is illuminating. The question I have is what is needed to change it?  What other books have you read in a similar vein to Fukuyama?",gomi-panda,2022-12-07T21:01:40,1
