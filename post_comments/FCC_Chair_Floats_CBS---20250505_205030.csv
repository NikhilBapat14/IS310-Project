"The past 40 years of dealing with media smear jobs:  *""We've tried like... nothing, man... and we're running out of ideas!""*  They can pose as the fourth branch of government when they want, and then when they're sued for lying they can say they're just entertainers and dodge responsibility. Meanwhile an internet personality who was never taken seriously by anyone was stripped of his worth for lying about his enemies.  It's not about inconsistency, the system lopsides itself the same way every time.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T21:43:16,7
