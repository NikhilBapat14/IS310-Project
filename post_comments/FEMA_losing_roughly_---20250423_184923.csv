Does anyone else think that the convictedfelon is trying to get people hurt? He‚Äôs doing everything he can to get rid of the very people that help during disasters. He‚Äôs crazy like that cause  problems & blame it on someone else! Just remember who he sent to get back money for the tax cuts of the billionaires. He‚Äôs crazy only pretends to care about anyone else!,sue--7,2025-04-23T19:13:56,2

It‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶Everything will be fine. I know cuz I have the ocean in my back yard and I‚Äôm ignorant. My neighbor the congressman doesn‚Äôt think coastal SC will need FEMA funds.,Tricky-Efficiency709,2025-04-24T10:18:39,1

This will end with a wet fart and a heart attack. Probably while rage tweeting.   Still 40% of the country will be worshipping him.,zffjk,2025-04-24T06:28:37,3
I think that is the point they want to do away with the tax system and go to a consumption tax only at the federal level. It will be up to the individual states to make up for what the Federal Government does not.,geekstone,2025-04-24T05:08:29,3
He wants FEMA to fail so he can say that government doesn't work,MyNameCannotBeSpoken,2025-04-23T20:18:41,6
They don‚Äôt help pay for anything. Ignorant people don‚Äôt contribute much. They don‚Äôt believe in education. I will never understand people like them. Here in KY the people who work in the coal mines were offered job training & education to be doing better jobs! They‚Äôre so stupid that they wanted to do the same things their grandpa did etc. They had various other excuses for turning down better jobs that didn‚Äôt include being underground. Ignorance is rampant in Kentucky & West Virginia!,sue--7,2025-04-23T19:22:14,7
