Did you have a stroke while writing this?  You seem to think that my plan is to be a burden to my children as soon as they move out. That isn't the case at all. However, when I am old and can no longer physically take care of myself, when I am in my mid to late 80's, then yes, I expect my children who will be in their 50's or 60's to take care of me.  >Why would I put more shit on top of their lives?  How old are you and how old are your kids? If you can still work then you should. You shouldn't be a drain on your kids lives. You also shouldn't be a drain on me and my kids lives either. Put your work boots on and go to work. If you are unable to work then the primary responsibility of your care should fall on your children. They love you and they will make the best decisions for you.  You are dumb if you think that Uncle Sam will care for you or make better decisions for you than your kids will.",mexils,2025-05-03T14:50:52,-1

"I agree.  This segment of people who have a rabid hatred of ""boomers,"" who they seem to think is everyone more than 3 years older than them, that insist on just ending it entirely and letting million just go homeless don't seem to understand this.  Yeah, revamp it.  I'm even willing to admit it might need a temporary tax increase to get it adjusted to where it should be so that we can be free of it for good.  But ""fuck old people because they fucked us over, despite 99% of people having nothing to with anything other than trying to raise their families and live their lives"" is pathetic and exhausting.",cathbadh,2025-05-03T19:34:10,4
"I stated i would live on the streets.  You don't fucking know me. I am homeless, and my husband of 30 years died from cancer. If you had any clue as to how life works,  when they say you lose everything to cancer,  you really do. I've never been on subsidys or accepted handouts.  I have my kids in different places than I am would never bother them with my struggles.  I was born on the streets, and although my husband provided me with years of solid American living cancer sucks you dry. Yet I'm still not a burden to my kids.  As far as they know, I'm good.",Wide_Fig3130,2025-05-03T15:14:25,3
"I don't think anyone on the right hates boomers (I've only seen this hatred from the progressive bunch that buys into the lie that everyone who votes Trump is old and white).   However, older voters did have a big hand in messing up the US, primarily with that neoliberal policies that are IMO the most evil policies, even worse than socialism. If libertarianism is ""I pay for myself"", and socialism is ""I pay for everybody"", then neoliberalism is ""our kids pay for me and everybody"".   I'm speaking about policies like social security, globalism, housing subsidies (that did nothing but raise house prices), unrestricted immigration, etc that came in under FDR, Johnson, and later Clinton and Obama.   These policies put us (their kids) in the mess we're in now. And some people may feel some resentment for that. Just on this thread there are three things that are gonna cost trillions to the economy to fix, social security, globalism and the national debt, which were made by voters in the 70s - 00s, many of whom have died and left the cost of paying for these scams to us.",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-03T20:09:49,2
">I am homeless,  That's terrible. Maybe you should let your kids know so they can help you get off the streets.",mexils,2025-05-03T15:33:03,2
"As I've said, i refuse to be a burden on my kids. They lost  their father and are not to far out of trying to figure out their lives or getting shit together or whatever.  My son pays my phone bill so I can keeping touch my answer is I'm ok I'm good il get more hours next week.  It doesn't matter to me how I am homeless or what not as long as they are doing well and I'm not a down on them.",Wide_Fig3130,2025-05-03T15:48:30,3
