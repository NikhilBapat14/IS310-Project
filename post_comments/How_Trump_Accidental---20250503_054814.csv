"I think a growing critique I have for the media is the use of intelligence in describing events. To say someone is stupid is already a really vague idea. What is stupidity? How does it start? And you end up dismissing the idea without investigating it for potential worth. I just feel that the word stupid has been turned into a catch all insult that is just meant to bully people into conformist thinking.  Some Notes  1. I am trying to say that the term stupidity is used so vaguely, we don't bother to understand the thing itself   2. The vagueness of the word Stupid probably stems from how it's such a flexible word that can refer to a lack of instinct, a lack of intuition, a lack of awareness, etc.   3. You inadvertently create a shaming of people who didn't bother learning the same thing or more likely didn't possess the same resources. There are people who could do with more critical thinking but a lot of people just aren't aware of the world from your POV as they've lived different lives. You create a situation where you are othering people, and making it a toxic trait to be out of the know.   4. Yes it is perfectly ok to say something is stupid, it's a popular word for a reason, it conveys a lot of meaning. I'm just calling out the click bait bullshit that I think is stupid.",LeLand_Land,2025-05-03T11:07:12,1

"> Drunk with hubris and high on his sad little fascist fantasies, Miller believes he can bury Americans in propaganda about criminal migrants, seducing them into embracing unchecked presidential power as essential to securing public safety. But Trump’s blithe admission that he can follow the law on Abrego Garcia anytime he wants to—and is not doing so because someone, somewhere told him he doesn’t have to—reveals this as entirely unmoored from anything resembling public order and the rule of law. It’s lawless, arbitrary, and dictatorial—proudly so, in fact.  > The more transparency we have gained into the rot of corruption and bad faith at the core of this whole saga, the worse it has come to look.

"My problem is less about whether or not Garcia should have been deported.  My problem is that there is a court order (which was upheld unanimously in the Supreme Court) demanding that the administration facilitate his return to the US.  Previously, Trump has claimed that this was outside of their power.  Now he's claiming that he can bring him back whenever, but his lawyers are instructing him not to?  So his lawyers are instructing him to willfully disobey a Supreme Court order.  I'm not sure who he plans on appealing it with.  Call me a callous human being for saying this, but I don't have a strong opinion on Garcia either way.  He might be an innocent victim, or he might be a violent gang member.  I don't know, and neither does anyone here.  More importantly, the agencies who deported him didn't know.  I may not have a strong opinion about Garcia, but I have very strong opinions about due process.  I also have the strong opinion that the executive branch can't just up and decide to ignore all Constitutional checks and balances, and refuse to obey a court order upheld by SCOTUS.  I'll be the first to agree that a lot of the previous impeachment attempts against Trump had very weak legal basis.  But if he continues along his current course, there would be very strong arguments for impeachment this time around.  It's funny how the same people complaining about sanctuary cities flouting federal law and doing what they please are totally okay with Trump doing the same with a court order.  Of course, it may be an unpopular thing to say here as well, but if you're for/against one of those things (from the legal standpoint, if not the moral), then you pretty much have to have the same stance on the other issue in order to maintain any sort of logical consistency.",HwackAMole,2025-05-03T11:35:07,6

Trump Ⅰ the people in Trump's orbit were a combination of old guard Republicans, people who loved Trump saying the quiet part out loud, and people who wanted to burn it all down. The people who were in charge, though, were the old guard, and they made sure that the people being installed at least had some nominal judgement and demeanor that fit with running the government. That's how you have a DOJ that is capable of running a prosecution competently, even though they don't have a leg to stand on. Shit was kept together, contained.  Since then personal fealty to Trump is now the most important credential. Everything else is secondary. And what we have now is a combination of people with some conventional political background that know how the levers of power work, like Stephen Miller, and incompetent jackasses, like that loudmouth Pete Hegseth.  So conventionally Trump (or any other Republican) would take their position, or do the thing, then the team would form ranks, tell him to take a seat, and then backfill the justification and legal reasoning for the thing. The problem is half of those people are gone now, and Trump thinks that approach is too slow and doesn't work. So now the team is less of a team, with a bunch of egos and personal brands with ambition and there's no desire from the President or the newbies to create the kind of cohesion necessary for creating a credible legal argument.  And the people who would have been the credible voices who *do their frickin’ job the best they possibly can, no matter who the President is*, the career workers at places like DOJ, are being fired because of that.

The Democratic party has had the power over the decades and even merely from 2020-2024 to stop Trump and shore up the country against everything Trump is doing now, and they did jack, like they always do.      This has been a decades long strategy of the Democratic party. Sit on their asses, let the Republicans get into power because people are frustrated over the fact that at most the Democrats only clean up after the last time the Republicans were in power, let the Republicans screw up the country, then the Democrats use that to get themselves back into power by looking as the ""sane"" alternative, then continue sitting on their asses, repeat. The Democratic party lives and dies off of letting the Republican party run hog wild without even trying to stop them, they always have.     The Republicans are most definitely not going to get off their asses to do anything if the Democrats won't either. The Democratic party should be hitting Trump with article of impeachment after article of impeachment for every single impeachable offense Trump has been making since the first day of his second term. They should be hitting the floor with bills designed specifically to stop Trump's actions. They should be hitting him in every single way they possibly can. In fact, Trump is doing the exact same thing right now, throwing one thing against the wall after another and seeing what sticks, which a lot is sticking because the Democrats aren't even trying to stop him.     Why should they do this? Because THAT is how support happens. THAT is how Trump is stopped, by actually TRYING to stop him. Whether any of it actually has the support to succeed right now is completely irrelevant. Every member of the Democratic party could be gumming up the works to at the very least slow down what Trump is doing and they are doing nothing whatsoever except making one or two token attempts to make it look like they actually care to do something. In fact, the Judiciary is doing much much more than the entirety of the Democratic party in Congress is doing.      The Democratic party is like the adult sitting there while the Republicans, the baby, run around with a box of matches setting things on fire and instead of taking the matches away so they can't keep setting fires the adult just puts out the fires, noticing but not caring that there are more fires burning that they could possibly put out until now, when the whole house is burning down.   The Republican party has been in this situation where they didn't have hold of any of the three branches of government over the decades and it never stopped them from still getting their agendas pushed through. There's zero reason the Democratic party can't do the same in return. Saying the Democratic party can't do anything is just an excuse to justify the fact that they don't do anything.

"> However, Jones granted Abrego Garcia’s request for a “withholding of removal” order based on his claim that gangs threatened his family in El Salvador and Guatemala:   Did you not read this?   He's a citizen of El Salvador. Order of Witholding stops him from being deported TO El Salvador. You can't deport a citizen of one country to another country they are not a citizen of, so this is effectively a stay of deportation. Even if he has an order of removal, he cannot be deported because the judge found cause to grant an order of witholding, meaning that unless they found ANOTHER country that wasn't El Salvador willing to grant him amnesty/stay, then he couldn't be deported, meaning he stays in the US. That's what immigration courts are for, and why they take so long because we have to PROVE people are from where they say they are from before deporting them, because if we deport a Guatamalan to Chile because they claimed to be from Chile, Chile can just be like ""lol"" and send them right back to us.  Do you not understand what ""order of witholding"" is?  If he's found guilty of beating a woman through due process, throw him in jail imo. That doesn't change the fact that there's an order of witholding that barred his deportation. His order of witholding was not removed thus his due process was violated. Supporting a criminal's right to due process does not mean you support their crime. I fucking think Ted Bundy was gross and deserved to be put to death, but I also believe he had a right to stand trial and have evidence heard and his guilt proven before a court of law.

"That is what withholding from removal is. They can’t be removed back to their country where their life or freedom is facing persecution. It violates the principle of non-refoulment. They can be deported to a third country willing to accept the individual.  You are misunderstanding. No one is cheering him on. We are saying that removing him violated US and international asylum laws and his rights were violated. If it was someone else, I would say the same thing. If it was Ted Bundy, I would feel the same way.  Here’s the thing, he was never charged and if he was, we would still be violating his right not to be deported to El Salvador. That’s the entire point. No I do not believe in deporting or incarcerating anyone indefinitely who has not been charged with a serious crime.  232 of the 238 Venezuelans have no criminal record in the US. They were deported to a maximum security prison know for committing human rights violations indefinitely.  El Salvador has been under a “state of emergency” since 2022 which means all constitutional protections have been suspended such as due process and court proceedings. They are now stateless and homeless in a foreign country who hasn’t had diplomatic relations with their own country, Venezuela, since 2019.   I understand what you are saying. I, a woman, spent 8 years in a relationship that was emotionally and physically abusive. I would love nothing more than to lock my ex up (he is a US citizen) in a foreign prison out of spite. I can also recognize how that would violate his rights.  Many had pending immigration and asylum cases which means they were here legally albeit they may have originally came through illegal means.  I totally get your anger my guy. Truly I do. My fear is that regardless if we think we are safe from this, if we let it happen to these people, we are sacrificing our own constitutional rights.  There are multiple SCOTUS rulings that have determined every person regardless of immigration status is entitled to due process.

"They can't deport him to Guatamala because he's not a citizen there. Again you fail at basic understanding, and that says a lot since you think that what I'm writing is ""a lot of words"". You don't seem to understand that. The Witholding was to both countries because they are big MS 13 strongholds and where he has family who have been threatened. He still wouldn't be able to be deported to another country. But sure, you obviously don't care to listen.  Sure it's a gross metaphor, and Ted Bundy's was too... I'm surprised a Serial killer who kidnapped teens, raped and killed them then repeatedly returned to violate their corpses is someone you're not aware of, though. My point still stands. EVERYONE deserves to have their day in court to face charges.  I too 'was a teen girl' who was sexually assaulted. The point is that EVERYONE deserves to have their day in court. But guess what? He was never charged with it, and tons of people get protection orders on their word alone against people who have never done anything to them, OR FROM THEIR OWN ABUSERS TOO. He was accused by his wife of physical assault, and the bar to get a protection order is solely if the judge feels that the petitioner is scared enough to need it and that there's a history of police calls for domestics at the residence(and domestics can be as simple as a yelling match when neighbors decide to call). She never pressed charges, the police never brought charges, he never went to court to face those charges, and was never convicted of those charges. I have a neighbor who has a protective order against another lady who was her roomate for nothing more than throwing a tennis ball at her, all because the ball thrower kept calling the police because she couldn't be a goddamned adult and not drink from 8am - 7pm every day.  Here in the US we are Innocent until Proven Guilty. To want anything else is to make us an Authoritarian country, and to do away with due process is to destroy your rights too, you know, not get raped and violated by men, or owned by them, or to have a voice and vote. The Right does not want women to have a say in anything, and for them to return to the state of being their husband's property.
