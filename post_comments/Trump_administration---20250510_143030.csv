"Okay, look—would a device that supports blood flow in infants with heart defects be, like, a cool toy to have? Sure. But wouldn't that money be better spent on a study investigating the miraculous health benefits of colloidal silver?  That could be a cure for autism. Or maybe cancer, diabetes, or ulcers. I mean—it has to cure *something*, right?  /s",Delicious_Toad,2025-05-10T14:57:29,1
"I had to read it twice to make sure it was true. It makes sense that a man without a functioning heart wouldn't care about defects in baby's hearts. When it comes to medical research, the US will be at the bottom of the heap. This makes me want we weep or puke or both.     Edit: Never forget this is to help pay for upwards of $5 trillion in tax cuts for billionaires.",invalidpassword,2025-05-10T15:09:54,1

This administration really hates research doesnt it. Granted they just want to push out their own papers filled with opinions and no scientific backing. Guess they don't want to compete against evidence and actual effort.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-10T15:18:19,1

"As a NICU nurse, this is absolutely disgusting to me. Not surprising, considering Trump thinks government should be run as a failing business and cut anything he deems ‘unworthy’. The strides we’ve made in caring for neonates in the 16 1/2 years I’ve been a nurse have been amazing…and he’s just trying to actively harm babies. So much for ‘pro life’.",greyhoundbrain,2025-05-10T15:58:19,1

"Here is one way to take action that may actually result in change: sign up for the General Strike.  Things are rapidly declining in our country and it’s getting close to “show up or shut up” time.  Let’s get this done and show this administration that we, the people, are prepared to shut the country down for as long as it takes to get real, lasting change.  Unfortunately, we can’t plan a date for the GS until we have the numbers large enough that can’t be ignored (11 million). Let’s get organized and show who actually has the power (hint: it’s people like you and me, if we can band together)  https://generalstrikeus.com/",hkyxt,2025-05-10T16:21:08,1
