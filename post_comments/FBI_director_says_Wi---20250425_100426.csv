"Now that it is Spring, I feel like ICE should have a pretty big thaw.  It is high time that American citizens began standing up to these extrajudicial (no, they aren't legal) abductions and not just with a small gathering or a strongly worded email to an elected official who will have some clown fresh out of undergrad regurgitate bullshit talking points as reasons why they can't do the moral/ethical/legal thing in response to clear and present danger to our Democracy.  Resisting authoritarianism is not a spectator sport, folks.  It is WAY beyond time to call for a general strike in this country.  We must not be complicit through inaction.

"> ""Judge Hannah Dugan is charged with obstruction,"" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a quickly deleted post on X.  Honestly, it's just... unbelievable. I mean, how can anyone even *begin* to trust the courts when we're hearing about a judge accused of obstructing justice like this? It makes you wonder, doesn't it, as the director asked, can you believe a judge is being accused of this, especially with a president like Trump in office? It just shows everything that's wrong with the system, and it's so scary to think about the implications... especially considering the director quickly deleted the post... it's just too much. A complete mess.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-25T10:06:40,11

"higher than Trump's  The dangerous thing about Hitler was that he was (relatively) smart at first, until he started overplaying his hand.

"If they didn't have a warrant (and in a lot of these they don't) and didn't coordinate with her court so she could handle it or raise a concern expediently then she doesn't have a hell of a lot of obligation to make him stick around after their business was done.  This is about intimidating anyone who would defend or speak for these people that Trump is ex-judiciously disappearing to overseas gulags.  Details will come out in count.  Maybe it will stand, but I doubt it.  Hell, I would look closely at any warrant to be sure it wasn't post-dated to make it legal after the fact.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-25T13:23:53,4

"Not-so-fun fact, the trains didn't run on time due to Mussolini's involvement. They were being improved as an infrastructure renovation project that started a few years before he took over, he just claimed credit for it. The claims that they did run on time were propaganda that was especially common in the US, but they weren't any more functional than what we had here, probably worse.
