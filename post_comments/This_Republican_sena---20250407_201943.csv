It sucks being on the same side as Rand,Leraldoe,2025-04-07T20:20:52,1
He’s defended Daddy Trump’s honor to the end. Even after Trump said he was ugly on national television. Get fucked Ayn. How’s your Libertarian utopia working out for you now?,cmiller4642,2025-04-07T20:21:49,1
Let me know when the House votes to curtail the tariffs. Speaker Johnson said he won’t bring any legislation to a vote that’s against Trump’s agenda,hamsterfolly,2025-04-07T20:28:58,1
"Only thing I'll give him credit for is consistency, unlike the fiscal hawks in congress.   Which should be a lesson for the other Republicans, stick to your position long enough and it'll be normalized as ""boys being boys"" rather than a treasonous backstab.",nerphurp,2025-04-07T20:37:00,1
"I hate rand paul so much, i almost agreed with the tarrifs, then i was reminded of the “let them fight” gif",Damerman,2025-04-07T20:26:35,1
Funny how the “party of capitalism” keeps pushing policies that tank markets and inflate prices,nav_2055_,2025-04-07T20:30:50,1
"Beyond ""principle,"" Canada’s boycott of Kentucky bourbon may be another reason why both of Kentucky’s senators, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, voted against Trump’s tariffs.

Haha charge. He should just stay on his knees.,laserdisk4life,2025-04-07T21:05:20,1
Bullshit “charge”? Bullshit . Republican tariffs Republican traitors Republican fascists . They are enabling every single move . Own it,Carrie3-po,2025-04-07T21:21:30,1
"If anyone had a clue, you would see that a lot of the elite replicans are freaking out because they now realise trump wasn't for the rich/elite but looking out for the working class.  If you don't believe me, go watch any red wing media atm. They are freaking out about losing massive amounts of wealth. A lot of the wealthy republicans assumed trump was aligned with wallstreet, but his actions show the contrary.  Hopefully, some democrats can sift through the noise and understand. Trump is looking out for the bottom 50%. Love to see it.",Scorned_Guardian,2025-04-07T21:02:01,1
"Once upon a time, Rand Paul's libertarian attitudes made him an occasional ally of liberals on social issues. He even appeared on Colbert's *Late Show.* Then he went MAGA culture warrior and lost any remaining credibility.",ArchdukeAlex8,2025-04-07T20:27:59,1
"Yes, it feels dirty to agree with him",JelloBelter,2025-04-07T20:28:23,1
Fuck him. He's a POS. I'll never be on his side.    He voted for this shit. ,AnoAnoSaPwet,2025-04-07T20:29:12,1
"Yes, agreeing with Rand feels like one of those '""out of place"" moments and it's wild when political alignment makes you question your own ideologies. But you know, strange times make strange allies.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:23:22,1
You have to take whatever help you can get.   That's why Democrats lost. They alienated to many people and not enough allies.   You need whatever allies you can get. ,Fantastic_Team_6,2025-04-07T20:38:16,1
I didn't realize until now that Rand Paul was almost certainly named after Ayn Rand.,LangyMD,2025-04-07T20:40:57,1
"It’s surprising how party loyalty endures insults when ego and delusion are involved. However, if this is his Libertarian utopia, I’ll stick with reality—imperfections and all.     I guess that his version of utopia involves cringing at someone who humiliated him on national TV.  In the end, it is a bold move that shows people how ""freedom"" really works.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:29:49,1
"Yes, it is hard to expect a lot of change when Speaker Johnson's priorities are more aligned with Trump’s policies.  Maybe the power of public backlash or pressure will make a difference, but I’m not expecting anything else; since he is still unapologetically attached to Trump.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:35:36,1

"Yes, consistency does count for something, but you are right—sometimes sticking to a position long enough can turn it from outrageous to accepted, even when it's questionable.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:46:32,1
Why would you agree with the tariffs?,Weary_Emu3999,2025-04-07T20:42:32,1
"Yeah, it is pretty ironic. The party that champions free markets seems to be doing everything but letting them work properly.  It is a classic case of interventionism contradicting the principles of laissez-faire economics.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:44:26,1
"True, personal interests like that can have a big impact on how senators vote, especially when it affects businesses back home for their constituents.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:45:31,1
"You know what, I’ll take it. If they are actually showing some willingness to prioritize the interests of their state and their constituents over sucking Trump’s mushroom dick, this is a good thing. That’s what they were elected to do.   Of course, it would have been a lot better if they came around a full decade ago, but I’ll take what I can get. I wasn’t expecting that they’d ever challenge Trump at all. I hope it’s just the beginning of the infighting.",Mewnicorns,2025-04-07T21:06:36,1
"Exactly. It is all about the money. When it starts affecting contributions, that is when they suddenly care.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:51:19,1
"I see your point—Trump’s actions did seem to go against the typical Wall Street ties that many expected. It is interesting how the elites react, but the real question is whether his policies can benefit the working class in the long run. Time will tell if Democrats can see through the noise and understand what is happening.",brendigio,2025-04-07T21:10:18,1
"Jesus Christ, man. The bottom 50% are the one who loss out with tariffs. They’re regressive tax. They literally can’t afford them. His policies are decimating the lower 50% of the country smh. ",Huge_Rich522,2025-04-07T21:34:37,1
Yeah occasionally his libertarianness comes out and he sides with liberals on some things. Although not nearly as sticking to those principles as his father did. He represents MAGA country so does whatever Trump says 90% of the time. ,Redwolfdc,2025-04-07T21:08:01,1
"Yes, it does feel weird and you might agree only on a few points, but it doesn’t make it easier.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:38:12,1
"Allies are important, but it is important to find those who align with core values, not just anyone random. It is definitely hard when broad alliances compromise principles.",brendigio,2025-04-07T20:42:25,1
