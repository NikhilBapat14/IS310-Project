"This is such a bizarre story. This student's visa was revoked (under the Biden administration!!) for no reason whatsoever, now the student is being detained for an indefinite period of time for no reason whatsoever.  >A Louisiana judge who denied Doroudi bond in mid-April said he didn’t sufficiently prove that he wasn’t a national security threat, Doroudi’s lawyer, David Rozas said. Rozas said he was “flabbergasted” because the government hasn’t presented evidence that Doroudi is a threat, though that is what the Department of Homeland Security has alleged.  Where did anyone ever get the impression that he's a national security threat??  Nothing about this story makes any sense.",sachiprecious,2025-05-04T07:32:16,17

These “Christians” have nothing to do with the Christ… there is a reason that the beginning of revelation warns that the church will be corrupted. If they actually bothered to read the book of acts… They would see that they are almost prescribing a communist/commune style of community lol,DeusExMachina222,2025-05-04T08:25:37,11

"Yes, the Biden administration shares blame for this one! It's shameful that this person's visa was revoked for no reason and they wouldn't tell him why. It makes no sense.",sachiprecious,2025-05-04T07:28:19,14
