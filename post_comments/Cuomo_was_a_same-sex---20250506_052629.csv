"Cuomo should be a registered sex offender, but he made some sort of slimy deal with his political allies to have his charges dropped.  It is not like he had one indiscretion, there were at least 11 different victims.  He never was punished and never apologized, he just gave a halfhearted statement that some media outlets claimed was an apology, then went straight to cable news.  Living off his father's name at age 67.  New York deserves better.",mmhannah,2025-05-06T07:03:24,16
"Aside from killing thousands of seniors during Covid, Cuomo wants people to forget he's a raging sex pest and misogynist.  Vote for Zohran Mamdani, do *not* rank Cuomo or Adams, do fill out every ballot line.",archetype1,2025-05-06T05:32:23,30
Start the redemption process by being elected dog catcher first. NYC needs less mayors with a checkered past.,steve_ample,2025-05-06T07:09:40,4

"No Democratic politician will want to bring up their response to Covid. Whether it was their hysterical overreaction, their dragging out school and business closures and other restrictions for months and months, or their dragging out inane and asinine mask mandates for months or years, all while every one of them flagrantly disregarded and ignored their own rules, that's a guaranteed loser. They'll stay as far away from that as they can.",SunriseInLot42,2025-05-06T06:35:20,-31
Buddy if New York City  can’t accept mayors with checkered pasts. Then it’s no longer New York City ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-06T08:16:09,3
"Nah, he’s an unnecessary shitbag like most establishment “centrist” dems. Time for new blood that won’t cower to the set frameworks. The working class is more malleable, and conservatives are shooting them selves in the foot currently. There’s no reason to keep repeating the same mistakes.",shartmarx,2025-05-06T06:58:55,8

You can always spot the morons when they start talking about mask policy being just the worst thing ever. ,alyosha_pls,2025-05-06T08:41:08,14
"You can always spot the basement-dwelling, antisocial Redditors who were “social distancing” long before March 2020 by their continuing defense of silly-ass Covid safety theater",SunriseInLot42,2025-05-06T10:19:59,-7
Buddy you're still ranting and raving about the lockdowns and social distancing. Grow as a person and move past it already. You think you're so much smarter than everyone else but you can't even wrap your head around the basic science behind what was done. You'll call everyone else fools and act like hospitals weren't completely overwhelmed. You'll act like measures taken to limit the number of hospitalizations are bunk science because you listen to snake tongues that are filling your mind with bullshit. I would pity you if you weren't such a drag on social progress.    Mfs like you get asked to do some some simple things as part of a collective effort to stop the collapse of our emergency medical system and you turn into complete nutcases. You're all narcissism and ego. ,alyosha_pls,2025-05-06T11:26:05,2
"""simple things"" like flushing months to more than a year of school, activities and socialization down the toilet for millions of kids who are at near-zero risk from Covid, or destroying countless businesses, jobs, and people's life savings for working-age adults at almost-near-zero risk from Covid, sure. Simple things to the ""work""-from-home Reddit crowd who was watching Netflix in their pajamas, perhaps.",SunriseInLot42,2025-05-06T11:36:53,-2
