"It's not going to happen. They're just trying to hide the fact that they are going to cut Medicaid.  And they keep lying about the cuts. They keep saying they're just defunding certain committees, which fund Medicaid.  It's basically defunding with extra steps. Which I don't understand how they think that this lie is going to work out for them in the end. Because they can say they're not defunding it all they want, and keep lying, but when people start getting kicked off of Medicaid or people aren't able to get healthcare, the lie is not going to work anymore.",Virtual-Pie5732,2025-05-10T12:07:40,1

Republicans pose this as a hypothetical question. They're never going to tax the rich as they should.,joekerr9999,2025-05-10T11:23:00,1
"Every single time we hear the same shit.  No, they are not going to tax the rich. They are going to lower taxes on the rich while cutting services for citizens and maybe raising taxes on the middle class like they did in 2017.Â ",eskimospy212,2025-05-10T13:06:12,1
The priority is to suckle the teat of the most well endowed. The Nazi GOP does not care about any of their constituents. All they want is money and power.,h8hannah8h,2025-05-10T13:34:09,1
