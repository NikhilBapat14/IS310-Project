Check the maga business website and search your local maga business. They're failing and angry about it but they can't speak out because of the death threats they'll receive. Hate to see it. So sad.,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-30T10:46:08,6

">“I gotta say just one thing about today’s news: That’s the best negative print I have ever seen in my life, and the markets need to, like, look beneath the surface of that,” Navarro said on CNBC Wednesday, adding that if one removes “the negative effects of the surge in imports because of the tariffs, you have 3 percent growth. So, we really like, uh, where we’re at now.”  If you don't count the damage we did, things are looking pretty good!   I actually don't know how to interpret these numbers. I'm not an economist. I'm going to reserve judgement until I hear an analysis from my favorite economist, Ron Vara.",def_indiff,2025-04-30T11:03:14,1

"Kind of funny, cause the company I work for went from having the best year in almost a decade to now discussing layoffs and needing to find cash (a lot of cash) immediately. We’re an American company that makes industrial equipment.  It’s being openly made clear that our customers are bearing the added costs. For now we still have orders. That could easily change, especially for foreign contracts. So much winning it’s almost too much.",hmr0987,2025-04-30T11:03:22,1
