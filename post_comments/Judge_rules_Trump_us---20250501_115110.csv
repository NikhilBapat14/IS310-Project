"“Allowing the President to unilaterally define the conditions when he may invoke the AEA, and then summarily declare that those conditions exist, would remove all limitations to the Executive Branch’s authority under the AEA, and would strip the courts of their traditional role of interpreting Congressional statutes to determine whether a government official has exceeded the statute’s scope. The law does not support such a position,” he wrote.   Each branch of the federal government must have the ability to reign in the other two. That fundamental aspect of checks and balances in our Constitution serves to protect our American way of life with rights that are “self-evident” no matter who is in power.",cap123abc,2025-05-01T11:59:21,171

"This judge is in the 5th circuit, which is the most conservative of the judicial circuits.

Let's hope that the appellate court upholds the ruling, as it should.    If the appeals court upholds the district court, then there is a chance that the Supremes may not bother to hear it and just let it stand, thus keeping their hands clean of the matter.",I405CA,2025-05-01T12:05:00,67

"When republicans in congress are unwilling to act cause doing so would get them primaried and the DOJ is being used as a political tool for the executive branch, the answers to your questions are infinite and never.  When Biden took over many wanted him to go after Trump for these types of actions. Biden largely took the high road and stayed out of the investigations in an effort to put those years behind us and try to stay partisan. It’s sure seems like that was a bad decision. Whoever is the next (non MAGA) president they really should setup an office to hold these people accountable. You can’t have administration officials running around doing illegal things and never being held accountable. It’s understood that all administrations float the line on these matters but this administration is so clearly acting illegally and in bad faith that the line is a blur in their rear view mirror.  I have no faith anyone will be held accountable so long as congress isn’t willing to act. They’ve never gone hard at Trump and it got us to where we are today. The game democrats are playing is not the same one that republicans are and it’s lead us to really dangerous places.",hmr0987,2025-05-01T13:06:56,34
