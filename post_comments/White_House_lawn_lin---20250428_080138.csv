The White House wanted these pictures on any broadcast filmed in front of the press area. I'm sure they'll adjust the camera angle to hide them anyway.,Kern_system,2025-04-28T09:47:00,113
The left will figure out a reason to file suit in federal court over this.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T08:15:23,89

The media already said they are going to trynto blur these posters. They don't want to be honest at all.,AndForeverNow,2025-04-28T12:29:41,25

"Illegal immigrants are criminals FYI.  The hint is the word ""illegal.""",RossBot5000,2025-04-28T09:01:21,123
"They aren't committing less crime, they just get away with more because they live in enclaves where nobody talks to cops. We know poverty is linked to crime and the crime rate back home are even higher, so it's a reasonable inference to make.  This is effective messaging, it resonates with voters, and they need to keep leaning even harder into it. This messaging resonates with something deeply ingrained in the human mind.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-28T09:32:54,21
>it pushes a false narrative that illegal immigrants are all criminals  The only one pushing a false narrative here is *you*.  Every single illegal alien is a criminal.  Every. Single. One.   So stop spreading bullshit.,yrunsyndylyfu,2025-04-28T09:27:55,58
"This is in direct response to the lefts political theater. They keep cherry picking cases like the “Maryland father” and completely ignore these just to paint him as a racist, fascist and what ever other “‘cist” you can think of.",maxroadrage,2025-04-28T08:56:24,42
> it pushes a false narrative that illegal immigrants are all criminals   It does* nothing of the sort unless you are a brainwashed leftist. It paints the picture that unfettered illegal immigration is problematic and there needs to be verification of who we let into our country. ,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-28T08:59:34,35
"When you have strong borders, you have reduced crime and drug infestation.  when you have a weak administration, that cascades to weak judges and governors and then they protect the illegal immigration mentality.    Why get insurance for your car?  why follow the rules? why not treat women like cattle?   and the drugs come in.  and child trafficking..     if this little cluster of signs makes you only think of a false narrative, you need to open you mind.",TooHotTea,2025-04-28T08:50:31,33
With all the things people are having issues with the border and deportation is not one of them. His polling is still sky high on that area.  And I don't know what friend group you have but everyone I know loves Trump trolling and messing with the media.,Duccix,2025-04-28T09:41:19,16
"All illegal immigrants are, by definition, criminals.",Jonathan-Strang3,2025-04-28T09:24:02,18
"I mean, how else do you combat the message from the left that the people being deported are all innocent family men?  I agree that the White House needs to do a much better job of extolling, the positive side of immigration, highlighting immigrants who have contributed to society, showing immigrant families that are happy and healthy and adapting to American society while still maintaining their own culture…   But at the same time, it’s about time that the right starts fighting dirty the way the left always does. I’ve been seen for years that unless the right figures out how to play the game the left is playing, then it’s a game over. Apparently, I’m not the only one who thinks that.",Left4DayZGone,2025-04-28T09:12:56,11
