"Before she died, she spent ten weeks in detention... for what? She supposedly ""didn't have a valid immigrant visa."" There are no other details. Nothing about her being a gang member or terrorist or anything. Why are people being detained for such long periods of time -- in harsh conditions -- when they aren't causing any harm to anyone? It's such a lack of compassion and decency. And because of these harsh conditions, people are dying. No, I don't believe they just randomly happened to pass away and it had nothing to do with the conditions of the detention centers.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T21:38:24,947

"People didn't know about the mass murder bit, and more importantly, my whole point is that it did not start that way.  It was just ""deporting criminals from the country"" in the beginning. Every step was very gradual. You would accept it, maybe with caveats. You would see yourself as a reasonable and nuanced person in your politics. ""Some people are taking this a bit too far, but they're stupid brutes after all. I'm not saying that's right but we also need to uphold the law."" and so on.   No need to overreact... and after all you'd feel very unsure, since life also looks so normal. Everything was normal. People worked and laughed and cried and loved and went out for beers and got a new dress and fought with their neighbor and ran to catch the bus and God my boss is annoying.  This is how you end up with holocaust.  It's not like an authoritarian leader just suddenly emerges and says ""hey let's kill everybody we hate on an industrial level!"" and then everyone is like ""yeah good idea let's go!""  That would never happen. It's gradual. It's every single time they do something just a liiiiittle but worse, and nobody feels like it's the right time or bad enough to start kicking and screaming.   In the 1950s Milton Mayer went to Germany and conducted in-depth interviews with ten regular Germans to try to understand what happened, how you end up with the Nazi regime, with holocaust, in a country full of perfectly normal, presumably non-evil people. He wrote a book called *They Thought They Were Free*. Everybody should read it. Quote (emphasis mine):  ""You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ""It's not so bad"" or ""You're seeing things"" or ""You're an alarmist."" **And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can't prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don't know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end?** On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.""  [...]  ""It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.  **But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds of thousands will join with you, never comes.** That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions, would have been sufficiently shocked-if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in '43 had come immediately after the ""German Firm"" stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in '33. But of course this isn't the way it happens. In between come all of the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C?  And so on to Step D.""  [...]  ""Suddenly it all comes down, all at once.  You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven't done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early morning meetings of your department when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood.  A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks.  Too late.

Seems similar to trump saying that Venezuela is waging war against the USA and on that premise he illegally detains people and throws them into an El Salvador concentration camp.  What were the consequences of the illegal Iraq War? There were no prosecutions of the perpetrators, no boycotts of America by the international community. The domestic political consequence for the criminals was to be reelected in 2004.  The people who did face consequences were the Iraqi people and the US soldiers that were killed or wounded as a result of the crime. Bush and Cheney get to live out their lives as wealthy assholes in America.  trump has good reason to not fear justice. America is not a nation bound by the rule of law.",VanceKelley,2025-05-01T03:06:57,6

Any reason why this was not done by Congress?

"There has been a few changes.  Quite significant changes.    1.  You now have wealthy tourists refusing to travel to the USA due to fears of not filling in a form, getting a fucked up customs person and being sent to a detention center without appropriate or adequate access to legal representation.  2.  I believe the random number I anecdotally read yesterday that it's now 100,000 sent to wherever in 100 days - no idea if that's a usual number.  3.  You have more than one or two dudes that have been sent to El Salvador mistakenly and they have been stuck in a legal no man's land while not being returned.  4.  College kids legally allowed to study in the US have been formally destined because they have protested the genocide in Palestine.  5.  Kids have been deported with their mothers rather than remained In the states with their US citizen fathers.  6.  Judges have been arrested.... For being judges and making informed judge decisions.     That is all off the top of my head.... And I don't even live in the states, it's all from my own news outlets.  You have a very eroded legal due process system..  It was one of the many things some of us foreigners have celebrated about the US.  Starting to make Italy in the late 90s early 2000s look like a kiddy playground.",happyinthenaki,2025-04-30T23:14:18,13

"I find straight black & white takes like these are just effortless.  Many didn't showed up to vote because they desire too much for a perfect candidate to their preference and they found none of the candidates with any chances to be that. So they chose to not vote at all. The rest simply just aren't politically informed to be interest enough to vote at all, so they're completely ignorant of the potential consequences. Not that they want this outcome. Little did they know/think, their choice to not vote backfired.

"While I don't disagree, we have to be careful spreading that blanket out too far, especially when Republicans worked so hard to disenfranchise so many voters through so many different means.  The closing of voting locations and purging of voter registrations definitely also had an impact.

"Personally I think a lot of people don't show up to vote because they're too busy just trying to survive. If you don't care that much about politics and it's all vague and distant to you, while the obligations of life (rent, feed/clothe/raise family, health problems etc) are right up in your face, you aren't going to take PTO to vote or ask your boss if you can come in a bit later, or go to the trouble of filling out an absentee ballot.

"Depends.  If your here on a student visa, applying for asylum or just a very boring tourist who was woofing or a digital nomad, not a resident yet and attending a Palestine protest.... Literally nothing.  Go about your business and keep on keeping on.    We do have the occasional deportation because it happens.  But when that happens there is a very real, fairly efficient court/legal process to ensure it is an accurate and timely deportation.  And that's the point, due process.    I get it, US has loads of borders and in the past the porous borders were an advantage not a disadvantage.  The change in rules meant people had to stay permanently not seasonally.  Poor seasonal workers often don't meet the strict criteria of the 'right kind of people' for permanent residence   But, the ultimate point, due process.

"To answer your question...Asylum is sometimes applied for, we have a fairly strict process, but once granted comes with a huge amount of supports.

They would get sent on their way and a denial to enter the country unless some form of distress is present.  We don't get the refugee boats like Australia occasionally does   People do occasionally get refused entry at airport gates.... And sent back on the next flight.  A commonish reason because someone is entering on a tourist visa with evidence present of planning to work in prostitution.  They just get sent back on the very next flight.... Cos why pay to feed them in detention?  They usually acknowledge it too though.  Disclaimer....

"Yup. These belong to the politically apathetic group. And it is by design. Further cutting an already deficient public education system and unnecessary vetting of voter rights and culling voter access will only exacerbate it all. The poorer you are and the more ""minority"" you are, the harder we will make it for you to vote or be educated enough to care to vote. Thus it makes the default voting base to lean to be more educated, wealthier, maybe older, and ""whiter"".
