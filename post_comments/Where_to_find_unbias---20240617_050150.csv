I think ignore news sources. Watch the videos of their speeches and their news and media releases. Check what laws they passed and what actions they took. Make up your own mind if they are making the world a better place. Or are even trying to ,youcantexterminateme,2024-06-18T03:34:26,26
"In addition to sources people have provided here, I would point out that it’s a presupposition commonly perpetuated by the culture that damning stories should even out. This is the danger of false equivalence and bothsidesism. Those stories being heavily on one side doesn’t necessarily mean the media is biased. It could just mean one side is incredibly corrupt (comparatively speaking).",lord-of-shalott,2024-06-17T19:27:58,41
"If you're looking for a newspaper, you [can't get much better than AP](https://hosted.ap.org/tags/united-states-government) for facts. AP is where most of the commentary style news sources get their facts before they put their spin on them. Seriously... most Fox News articles you can google the ""fact"" paragraph in their story and it will turn up the AP source, an then there are 8 paragraphs of the Fox News narrative with self referential links.

"This site [rates media outlets based on leaning and factuality](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/).   I personally like it because they split it into two categories. Like ""yeah, Jacobin is very far on the left but they put a lot of effort into properly sourcing their articles and are very factual"". Oftentimes that's much more insightful because just because a newspaper is middle of the road doesn't mean they are factual.",WilhelmWrobel,2024-06-18T01:29:59,3

"Unfortunately, there are no such neutral places or sites you can visit. If you were interested in more bias and less bias there would be quite a few places. Even leaked government information does not necessarily reveal real facts though they may expose some lies from time to time; sometimes they are purposefully leaked   However, if you are interested in teaching the youngster facts you have solid 4 years of presidency of each candidate. When you say facts; I presume the actions they took while in office. They each passed multiple Executive Orders which reveals a lot about their world views. Their views on immigration; Additionally, you can look at their record of foreign interventions; Iran, the Middle East, Europe, China and the rest of the world generally.   As well as actions they took regarding climate change; COVID interventions and for German students; the stance of each president towards NORD Streams.",PsychLegalMind,2024-06-17T18:09:52,3

"America Uncovered, by Chris Chappel. They're honest to God one of the ONLY American news sources that is unbiased. I've been watching him for years and to this day don't know if he leans right or left (it's very possible he's in the middle, of course). If you watch one video of him criticising Biden, you may think he supports Trump, but then the next day you'll see him criticizing Trump, and then you'll realise he's actually very well balanced.

"I think this is good as a broad sketch, but some of the ordering is strange. For instance, ""The Economist,"" which--although well-respected--has an explicit tradition of editorializing in all their articles, is somehow ranked as less biased than the Associated Press, which is about assembling the facts of a story for it's other members to use.  It also doesn't distinguish between types of articles within each news source.
