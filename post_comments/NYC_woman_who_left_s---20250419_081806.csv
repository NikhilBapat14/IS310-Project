Cohen?   Is she Jewish?   Why would she put a swastika on the brick?  1000% guaranteed if it was a Muslim last name the religion would have been plastered all over the news.,Ironman650,2025-04-19T08:23:02,42

She hopefully lost her license to practice therapy. Blaming others is not a self-regulating tool. Sad for her she allowed her emotions to get the best of her and act out.,Psychotherapist-286,2025-04-19T09:36:09,5
Tantrum is the perfect word for it. It seems like liberals have not grown out of the terrible twos and resort to tantrums when they don't get their way.  Firebombing and destruction of property is nothing more than a glorified 2 year old tantrum.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-19T09:44:18,6
This makes complete sense if she IS a nazi.  Maybe it's her mark like pissing on a fire hydrant.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-19T10:05:35,5
a therapist.    let it sink in.  this therapist is telling other people how to deal with their issues in life.   and works with children.   folks like her are also in the education system which says a lot about how the left reacts to things.   IE riots and burning things.       physician heal thyself.,whydatyou,2025-04-19T09:54:52,4
"""blamed Elon Musk for her heinous actions as she was taken into custody""  Elon didn't make you vandalize a car, lady.   You'd think a therapist of all people would be able to control her anger and take responsibility for her actions.",AlicesFlamingo,2025-04-19T09:17:53,3

"""...University of Massachusetts Boston student..""  .  No surprise.

Not sure. I wish news articles would link to their sources more often. I’m sure Brooklyn criminal charges are publicly available somewhere.,777_heavy,2025-04-19T11:04:48,1
">In 2015, she also helped young offenders as part of the Kings County Re-Entry Task Force, working in tandem with the Bureau of Youth Diversion and Initiatives to keep criminals out of prison.""  That's not as bad as it sounds there are plenty of these programs throughout jurisdictions in the US that instead of immediately incarcerating young, 1st time, or non violent offenders they offer alternative options such as Drug courts, probation, house arrest, community service  counseling etc... Not every one that commits a crime needs to be sent to prison.     People in these positions aren't advocating for the El Chapos of the world to be ROR.",Lawgang94,2025-04-19T13:28:47,2

"I don’t understand your replies here. Are you being purposely obtuse? Sarcastic? Are you just tuning in to the news since January? Dipshits like this lady are convinced Elon Musk is a Nazi because he’s not towing the batshit Leftist line. They are now attacking his products and manufacturing/sales as “protests”.

I did not ask if you were stupid.
