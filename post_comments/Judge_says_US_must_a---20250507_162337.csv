This should not even be controversial at all. The fact that so many Americans seem absolutely fine with throwing away due process for just being accused of being illegal is insane to me.,sedatedlife,2025-05-07T16:27:11,35

We could make it easier for people to become citizens... Many of these people are just here to work. A lot have been here for a long time and aren't criminals... This doesn't have to be this hard.,MasterOfManyWorlds,2025-05-07T17:21:22,14
"The point is, if they're being sent to a country they've never been to before, then it's not ""deportation.""  They're using that word and it's not the right word.

"Bring here illegally is a crime. They are already criminals.

That's beside the point. The fact that they are removed to a country they've never been to does not mean they weren't deported. You just completely changed the subject.,Mavian23,2025-05-07T20:37:37,-1
"> Bring here illegally is a crime. They are already criminals.  I mean... talk about circular reasoning. It's illegal because they're illegally here because it's illegal to be here illegally? Sure, but a civil or misdemeanor offense isn't grounds for violating due process and sending people to the wrong countries or horrific places they're seeking asylum from. As the Trump administration has shown by revoking the legal status of ***over half a million legal, documented, law-abiding, productive migrants who had permission to be here already,*** it's not ""illegals"" they're after... just immigrants. We have the resources to address people without deporting them to mass prisons where they'll be imprisoned for unknown amounts of time without ever being charged by a crime.",Purusha120,2025-05-07T17:58:23,12

"Technically speaking, it's a civil offense. J-walking is a civil offense. How many of us would be considered criminals if we followed your logic that such things are crimes? The distinction is important.  Edit: I should note that hopping the border \*is\* considered a crime, but only a certain percent of folks entered that way.",devikatzen,2025-05-07T17:59:59,6
"“Bring here illegally is a crime. They are already criminals.”  Nope.   Undocumented immigration or unauthorized presence is a civil infraction, not criminal.   Additionally, many of those being deported now came here legally as international students or asylum seekers and have subsequently had their visa revoked under pretty flimsy pretenses. They were legal right up until Trump’s goons decided that they weren’t.",thejimbo56,2025-05-07T22:39:01,3
"The bigger issue is not that they are not sent to their own country (which is still an issue) but that they are not merely deported - after which you are free once arriving - but have been transported to a foreign jail and held there.   We had a word for this during 9/11, it was rendition. The government moves the detained person to a foreign location, jails them without trial and without a release date in what may be terrible conditions, up to and including starvation and torture, without protection of basic constitutional protections, especially due process and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment   The folks being sent to El Salvador and Libya are not merely deported, they are renditioned",Tao_of_Ludd,2025-05-08T04:37:45,2

"Unlawful presence, such as overstaying a visa or entering without inspection, is typically a civil violation under immigration law. **The penalty is usually deportation (removal)**, not jail time.  There are immigration-related actions that are criminal, including: - Illegal reentry after a formal deportation — this is a federal felony. - Fraudulent entry or using false documents can also be charged criminally. - Human smuggling or trafficking is criminal.",foochacho,2025-05-07T18:57:40,1
"I hope you never find your life in the hands of someone like yourself.  >""Sucks that you were born on the wrong side of an imaginary line! I know you're trying not to die and all but I just can't condone you crossing this line. Go back home and die in a ditch where I can't see you. Good riddance.""  I doubt you actually advocate this but it is how you sound to us. We don't think they deserve a death sentence or a life of quiet systemic injustices that tear them down and prevent them from ever truly thriving. However, we DEFINITELY don't think that ANYONE deserves to be deported before they even have a chance to prove whether or not they are here legally or not, PERHAPS NATURAL BORN CITIZENS!  If you were mistakenly taken by ICE, would you not be PISSED if you got deported to some country without a trial when you're a citzen of the USA?  If you were being deported for fleeing persecution and seeking asylum and another country said they would take you and keep you safe, but you get sent back here for execution, wouldn't that feel indignant all the way to the execution?  What if one of your family members was accidentally taken by ICE and deported?  Edit - addendum:  Also, why do you think they are criminals? Even if they were, crime for most of these people is stealing food to survive. Working illegally to pay taxes and have housing and help the local communities.

"Each country is responsible for their own people. The United States is not responsible for the rest of the world.  Each person may give up whatever amount they like to another person. If you are comfortable, giving up everything that you have to a foreigner, then you have the right to do that. But we don’t have the right to force everyone else in our country to give up the things that they have.  Living in our country is not a little amount of charity. The opportunities and resources that illegal aliens take from citizens is not an acceptable loss. That’s why we have laws against it, just like every other country in the world.",foochacho,2025-05-07T19:38:32,-1
Do you seriously think the USA exists as it does without the rest of the world? We are responsible for the effects of the systems we exploit for our benefits. Especially when we deny the power to fix them to those who we exploit. We do not have the right to thrive off the backs of unseen others. The laws clearly are not working or we wouldn't be having this discussion.,samuraiseoul,2025-05-07T19:40:44,3
Do you believe the rest of the world doesn’t benefit from the money we spend outside the US?,foochacho,2025-05-07T19:48:22,2
"Sure, I agree, some countries do benefit from U.S. spending, albeit dispraportionally to even each other irregardless of need, but often not nearly as much as we benefit from the systems that extract from them in the first place. A few billion in aid or building a factory that forces the same skilled labor to be done as would be in the US but for worse conditions and less pay. It doesn’t cancel out decades of resource exploitation, military intervention, or rigged trade. In some cases we even directly destabilized their governments to make conditions more favorable for ourselves and now the effects of it are forcing some of this migration. We ARE unfortunately responsible for holding our leaders and ourselves accountable.       Personally though, I would rather just build systems that make migration less necessary. Instead of punishing those who are just trying to survive with their self-worth in-tact. It’s not about did they earn it, it's about do they need it and are we benfitting from them not getting it? It’s about repairing the damage that we still benefit from today. Instead of making things so bad for them here that they don't want to come, let's give them what they need to build their own places they want to be in, not what we think they need, what they tell us they need. Its like saying if we just make prisons even more terrible then people would stop committing crime. Crime keeps going up and prisons keep getting worse. I don't think its working.       Back to building better systems though, take North Korea for example. I'm more familiar with the numbers in East Asia than the nations south of our borders so I'm going to use them as an example. We(the USA) spend around $6–9 billion a year just to contain North Korea. But economists have run scenarios where flooding them with education, food, and connectivity(to the point where even the elites couldn’t skim it all) would cost the world only around $20–25 billion/year. That’s not cheap, but it’s considerably less than we pay globally to maintain the stalemate, more than $40 billion. It would actually change lives instead of just managing a crisis as well and eventually probably reduce the cost over time.       Wouldn’t it be more ethical and ultimately more efficient to design systems where no one feels forced to flee or fight to be safe? Where kindness is how evolution starts to run instead of domination? We can be kind while also enforcing boundaries, but if the boundaries remove other's dignities for only our own benefit and wants, then is that really the kind of morality you want to live by?       Systems get better with kindness, and we can always choose to be kinder!",samuraiseoul,2025-05-07T20:12:40,2
"I would prefer other countries do a better job supporting their people, too.",foochacho,2025-05-07T20:15:10,1
"Me too! Them as well! We all want them to be able to take care of themselves on their own terms!       The problem is that we often are unwittingly supporting systems that exploit other places invisibly that prevent them from being able to support their people. Overfishing is a big problem we enable with our love and demand for sushi as a nation that drastically disadvantages nations too small to be heard.       How do you think we can start taking steps to help the immigrants be here and feel safe with their needs met, while enabling them to work to effect change back home? Many love being here, but yearn for the day they could go back to their loved ones. Many don't want to be here, they just don't want to die a slow undignified death back home.

It’s not our responsibility to support foreigners.,foochacho,2025-05-07T20:42:38,1
"It has been fun discussing this with you but I don't think we're getting anywhere anymore. I think this is a good place for me to step back as a result. Just to summarize though the position you have articulated, intentionally or not:  * Other countries *should* support their people better. However, it’s not our responsibility to help, even if our systems helped cause the instability, even if we benefit from it. * You agreed that *some* countries benefit from U.S. spending, but deny any deeper obligation tied to the systems that create those imbalances, even if we contribute to it directly via our actions. * You’ve clarified that supporting “foreigners” at all is beyond what you consider our responsibility, with no regards to the circumstances that forced them to need support.  That is a worldview that you are allowed to have, and I have a right to disagree. I believe dignity, survival, and interdependence *shouldn’t stop at borders*, **especially** when borders are often drawn by the very nations and empires that created the harm.  Like I said though, I’m going to step away. If you ever want to revisit these questions and explore systems, accountability, or shared flourishing for EVERYONE,feel free to circle back.       Take care. Stay well. Be Kind.",samuraiseoul,2025-05-07T21:08:27,2
