Being evil is not enough for some people. They need everyone to match their level of gross. And this asshole is alarmingly gross.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-03T21:28:18,11

Texas State University is in San Marcos. It also a good place to spend some time during a summer weekend tubing down the river.,KnowledgeAmoeba,2025-05-03T21:29:20,4

Weird how people dragged Biden back in November but have suddenly stopped with the new administration. I wonder how that happened…,P1xelHunter78,2025-05-03T21:46:43,-5

"Thanks, it’s important that we do what we can to help people that do the right thing. Especially like here - San Marcos had nothing to gain but so much to lose just for standing up for what’s right. It’s the kind of behavior we want to encourage.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-03T21:41:07,1
Where are all these people who voted for Trump to save Palestine? He’s a Dove right?,myfakesecretaccount,2025-05-04T00:30:43,3
"I suspect most of people who were pushing that narrative right before the election are happy as a clam with Trump, and the ones who aren’t are embarrassed as hell. I went on and on until I was blue in the face, especially on here telling fellow liberals that it’s a pretty obvious disinformation campaign and not to fall for it, but it didn’t seem to work. As for reasons I stated before, I suspect a lot of those people were never gonna change their mind. My thoughts drift back to my native Michigan and places like some of the suburbs of Detroit where they were likely able to peel off a lot of Arab Americans over the Gaza thing. I’d assume they know a lot of people who are in real danger from ICE right now. Part of me feels bad for them, but part of me doesn’t.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-04T06:51:26,-3
"How was it a disinformation campaign? All Biden/Harris had to do was give a single inch.  Instead, they stood firm alongside Netanyahu who is now announcing plans to take over all of Gaza... just as the protesters said would happen a year ago.",Overton_Glazier,2025-05-06T04:27:23,0
