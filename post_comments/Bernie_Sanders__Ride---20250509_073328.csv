"A private jet makes perfect sense when you're doing back to back rallies and are someone who is famous/prominent enough to be recognized and potentially cause issues on commercial flights. I don't think many would disagree with that (especially when its not on the taxpayer dime).  HOWEVER, when you've spent the last 10 years telling others that the planet is dying and its all because of these millionaires / billionaires on their private planes then it becomes hypocrisy. You dont get to have it both ways Bernie.",trs21219,2025-05-09T08:04:16,106

No different than obama and others buying mansions on the coast line after telling us that global warming will cause a huge sea rise.,optionhome,2025-05-09T08:11:39,26
This is how a socialist rationalizes everything he does to enrich himself and control others.  For their own good. Because they can't do it themselves,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T11:56:24,3

"He is the epitome of the communist leader, now represented by the WEF elites.  The peasants get two new shirts per year, and get to go on a vacation by public transit every third year.  They fly in business jets where ever and when ever they please and wear bespoke tailored suits.  And they see no problem with that.  So he sees no issue with wagging his finger at a Fortune 100 CEO that took a jet to D.C. to testify before his committee yet doing to same to attend his own events.",WIlf_Brim,2025-05-09T08:27:55,21

"The big issue is meat, and growing crops too.  We need to stop eating all meat and stop eating farm grown crops. We should all learn how to live a proper, responsible lifestyle and live off sunshine, air, and burning sage.  Otherwise we’re all gonna die. Fire and brimstone.
