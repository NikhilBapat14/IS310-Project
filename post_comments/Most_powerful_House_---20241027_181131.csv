"**I'm not sure if anyone is both knowledgeable enough and willing to take the time to answer this, so here's what Google's Gemini has to say:**  ------- You're right, Ways and Means and Appropriations are generally considered the top two most powerful House committees due to their control over taxes and spending, respectively.  The Rules Committee is also extremely powerful as it controls which bills make it to the floor and how they are debated.  Here's a breakdown of some other powerful House committees and where they generally fall in the pecking order, along with their jurisdictions:  High-Influence Committees:   * Energy and Commerce:  Vast jurisdiction covering healthcare, energy policy, telecommunications, consumer protection, and interstate commerce. This committee often deals with major legislation with significant economic and social impact.   * Financial Services: Oversees the banking system, financial markets, insurance, and housing.  Given the importance of the financial sector to the U.S. economy, this committee wields considerable influence.   * Judiciary:  Handles matters related to the legal system, including federal courts, law enforcement, and civil liberties.  This committee also has jurisdiction over impeachment proceedings, giving it significant power at times.   * Armed Services: Oversees the Department of Defense, military spending, and national security policy.  Its influence can vary depending on the geopolitical climate.  Mid-Tier Committees:   * Foreign Affairs: Deals with U.S. foreign policy, treaties, and international relations.  Its power can fluctuate depending on world events.   * Homeland Security: Oversees national security issues related to terrorism, border security, and disaster preparedness.   * Oversight and Accountability:  Investigates government waste, fraud, and abuse.  It has broad jurisdiction to examine any federal program or agency.  Other Committees:   * Ethics:  Enforces rules of conduct for House members.  While not involved in major legislation, it plays a crucial role in maintaining ethical standards.   * [Other committees]:  Committees like Agriculture, Education and the Workforce, Transportation and Infrastructure, etc., have significant influence within their specific policy areas, but their overall power within the House is generally less than the ones listed above.  Important Notes:   * Committee Power is Dynamic: The relative power of committees can shift over time depending on the political climate, the issues of the day, and the personalities of the committee chairs.   * Subcommittees Matter:  Within each committee, subcommittees often hold significant power as they specialize in specific areas of the committee's jurisdiction.   * Individual Members:  Powerful committee chairs and individual members with expertise or seniority can also exert significant influence, regardless of the committee's overall ranking.   Ultimately, the power of a House committee is a complex interplay of factors, including its jurisdiction, the political climate, and the individuals involved.",BarkLicker,2024-10-28T12:05:21,1
