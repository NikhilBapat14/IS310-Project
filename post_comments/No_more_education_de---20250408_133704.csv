"If future historians are trying to give this era a name, I volunteer the Golden Age of Ignorance, where we had the resources to make everyone’s life better, to eliminate world hunger and homelessness, to secure our planet as a beautiful oasis in the vastness of space, and to ensure the health, both physically and mentally, of every human on the planet, but instead we chose to put an ignorant fucker in office that is actively destroying the lives of everyone",annaleigh13,2025-04-08T13:56:04,62

I'd say the issue is more with the misinformation campaigns and extremely individualistic culture. The majority feel justified in doing only what's best for themselves without having the tools and knowledge required to even know what would be best. It's created an incredibly short-sighted and clout-seeking couple of generations.,batdog20001,2025-04-08T22:17:58,1
