"The comparison is not ideological it’s about tactics. Maoism was rooted in Marxist revolution, both movements share patterns like purging institutions, fostering a cult of personality, attacking intellectuals, and reshaping truth to serve power. It's filtered through American nationalism, not communism. The parallels are structural, not ideological, and they serve as a serious warning.",mikadouglas1,2025-04-15T06:33:34,220
"AFAIK the comparison was first made in China itself. There was an excellent short [article](https://archive.ph/zF06K) on this topic in *The Economist* which I presume a lot of American contributors read and regurgitated. This is the part most pertinent to your question:  >Various features of Mr Trump’s rule recall the Maoist mayhem. One is the appointment of an outsider, Elon Musk, to lead the assault on the federal bureaucracy, just as Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing, was put in charge of his “Cultural Revolution Leading Small Group”, tasked with “bombarding the headquarters”. Mr Musk’s young helpers are compared to the gangs of Red Guards; Mr Trump’s ill-qualified Cabinet members to Mao’s neophyte picks for the Politburo. “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” tweeted Mr Trump on February 15th. As some note, that was like Mao’s rallying of Red Guards in 1966 with what became the Cultural Revolution’s catchphrase: “To rebel is justified.”  For in-depth explanations of Mao's philosophy during the Cultural Revolution, it would probably be better to pose the question at r/askhistorians.",Pimpin-is-easy,2025-04-15T02:17:21,114

"If Trump gets his way, he will have a garden-variety isolationist authoritarian regime ala Franco.  You can pretty much do what you want.  Listen to your rap music, watch your TV sports, enjoy your porn.  But those who upset him are to be punished.  The administration is trying to bully everyone into fearing its authority.  Unfortunately, we have had some conspicuous examples of those who have succumbed to it, including major law firms and universities.  That has been a huge mistake, as bullies respond to appeasement with more bullying.  Trump does not want a cultural revolution.  He wants a mafia empire in which he is free to push people around and grift everyone who he can for cash.  Fortunately, Trump is a paper tiger and can be constrained.  He has surrounded himself with lackeys, and lackeys tend to not be the sharpest tools in the shed.  Their overreach is setting them up for failure.  Flooding the zone puts people on guard.

"I think Mussolini would probably be a better comparison in the sense that Mao, regardless of how you feel about him, seemed to be driven by a structured set of beliefs - he did what he did because he genuinely believed it was the right thing to do.  Trump seems to do what he does because he wants to or because he's moved to do so at a particular moment or out of spite. There's not an organized ideological framework behind his actions.  I think the cult of personality that Mao engendered is a fair comparison - you've got Republicans scrambling to wear gold pins of his head, bills to rename mountains after him, put him on currency, make his birthday a national holiday, etc.  I can see the comparison between now and the Cultural Revolution but I think this is more focused on the leader's personal whims than the Cultural Revolution was necessarily.",HeloRising,2025-04-15T00:29:27,22
"Italy under Mussolini I think is the closest comparison.  * Sees the population angry due to systemic poverty, government corruption and inefficiency, crime, economic crisis, and war losses far exceeding anything gained from it. * Rises as a popular demagogue who rallies the people, promising to ""make the trains run on time"" and fix all the other problems. * Marches on the capital and seizes power by force (with parts of the government agreeing to surrender to him rather than risking a full-blown civil war, even if it meant violating the Constitution.) * Uses aggressive populist and nativist rhetoric, relying on ""real patriots"" as the muscle, and putting them in opposition to liberals and foreign influences. * Uses extra-judicial means to get his way, and weaponizes the law as tool of political influence. Coins the phrase, ""For friends, everything. For enemies, the law."" * Implements a tough-on-crime agenda, decimates the Mafia.  ===> you are here.  * Starts expansionist wars, which initially went fine (since they were against far weaker enemies), though at the cost of outraging most other World powers and becoming an international pariah. * Allies with other fascist powers. * Joins a World war on the wrong side. * Takes heavy losses, culminating with losing the capital. * Sees the country switch sides and declare him an outlaw. * Gets caught by Partisans and straight up doesn't have a good time.  One notable difference is that, when it all ended, then-US gave Italy massive aid and economic integration to rebuild the country and restore its democracy, as part of the Marshall Plan. No state would be willing and able to offer today's US a similar aid package, should we end the same way WW2 Italy did.  ---   Going back even further in history, I think there is an uncanny amount of both political and socio-economic parallels between today's America and late Republican Rome. Trump is an echo of Roman Dictator Sulla Felix, who made it his goal to ""restore"" Rome to its old glory and traditions, after being unhappy with the poor, as well as Rome-allied cities, getting ""too many"" economic and political rights within Rome itself. This was compounded by Rome being stuck in a quagmire war, and changing socio-economic conditions which eroded the Roman ""middle class"" due to growing inequality and a mass influx of slaves who worked for less than free Romans (compare with automation-driven unemployment today.)  Sulla's ascension split Roman political partisanship into right-wing *optimates* and left-wing *populares*, not unlike today's conflict between MAGA and Progressives. Furthermore, Sulla adopted violent and illegal means of achieving his goals, setting off a chain reaction of political strife and civil wars that ultimately destroyed the Republic.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-15T02:32:04,24

"Comparing Trump 2.0 to Maoism might seem like political hyperbole at first glance, but there's value in looking at the underlying patterns—especially when we care about the long-term health of democratic societies. Mao's Cultural Revolution weaponized populist rage to dismantle intellectual, cultural, and institutional foundations in the name of purity and loyalty. It wasn’t about reform; it was about control.  When any movement begins to define loyalty to the nation as loyalty to a single leader, attacks knowledge-based institutions, and encourages mass moral panic, it's worth paying attention. The similarity isn't ideological—Maoism was Marxist, Trumpism is nationalist-populist—but the tactics of eroding independent thought, painting critics as enemies, and cultivating a sense of cultural siege feel eerily familiar.  The real risk is not whether history repeats itself identically—but whether it rhymes just enough that we miss the warning signs until it's too late.",Only_Economics7148,2025-04-15T01:43:51,15

"Mao thought a major problem with the Soviet Union, and a creeping problem in the PRC, was the emergence of a new ruling class of bureaucrats. Mao wasn't alone in this:  many anarchists and democratic socialists made this same criticism. Mao advocated for ""continuous revolution"" against crypto-bourgeois socialist elites to restore democratic, proletarian control of society.   Trump, less elegantly and probably not entirely consciously, has made the same argument about the US: unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats, not ""the billionaiyas,"" have become the true ruling class in our society, and Trump has made it his mission to depower the bureaucrats by mass-firing them, discrediting them with the people, and breaking up the institutions through which they exercise their power.   Mao also believed certain urban intellectual elites, especially students, had lost touch with the rural working class, so part of the cultural revolution involved sending those students to work in the countryside. It was recently reported that  scientists in state parks [were forced to clean bathrooms](https://www.sfgate.com/california-parks/article/yosemite-national-park-scientists-clean-bathrooms-20271616.php), so maybe there's something there?   tl;dr: Both Trump and Mao believe bureaucrats have become the new ruling class of their respective countries, and took steps to combat bureaucrats.",Cr3pyp5p3ts,2025-04-16T09:57:52,1

"Fascism is often defined by the fusion of state and corporate power, violent suppression of dissent, and the use of force to maintain social and economic hierarchies. Trump 2.0 exhibits fascist-like traits through extreme nationalism, loyalty demands, scapegoating minorities, and plans for expanded executive power over the economy and law enforcement. While American capitalism has traditionally avoided direct state control of industry, Trump’s interventionist policies—such as tariffs and regulatory retaliation—blur the line between free-market capitalism and authoritarian economic nationalism. The Battle of Blair Mountain (1921), the largest labor uprising in U.S. history, reveals proto-fascist dynamics in the way private coal companies and local authorities combined their power to violently crush striking miners seeking basic rights and union recognition. During the battle, between 50 and 100 people were killed—most of them miners—with hundreds more wounded. Coal operators financed private armies, deputized townspeople, and enlisted local and federal law enforcement to suppress the miners, mirroring fascist tactics of using both state and private force to break labor movements and maintain elite control.   While the U.S. in the 1920s was not a fascist state, the labor wars—including Blair Mountain—demonstrate how American elites sometimes used methods resembling fascism: denying workers’ rights, deploying overwhelming violence, and subordinating democracy to private power. As Franklin D. Roosevelt warned, “the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism—ownership of Government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.” The labor wars show how, in moments of crisis, American capitalism could take on authoritarian, anti-labor characteristics akin to those found in fascist regimes.",radio-act1v,2025-04-15T06:19:57,1

"Mussolini’s apt for sure, but even Mussolini was a true believer in Nationalism from what I understand; for Trump nationalism seems completely to be a means to an end.

Trump on the other hand is a draft dodger who is motivated by money and power— he will do whatever he can to achieve those things. Nationalism is the easiest ideology to get a cult following from, in a country which already does half of the job for him by pushing national myths of American exceptionalism for bare minimum a century, if not several.   They do have their strongman rhetoric, the cult of personality, and use of nationalism in common, but Trump is like the least ideologically motivated fascist of all time which is saying a lot because most fascist leaders have only vaguely coherent ideologies outside of their centralization of power and nationalist tendencies.

"That’s a compelling point, and I’d agree that personal loyalty to the leader is a defining trait of both movements. In that sense, you’re right: the “ideology” becomes the person. What begins as a political mission often collapses into cultic loyalty, where dissent equals betrayal and power justifies itself.  Still, I’d argue that this *leader-as-ideology* dynamic is a symptom of authoritarianism, not a philosophy in itself. Maoism initially cloaked itself in Marxist theory and class revolution. Trumpism leans into nationalism, grievance, and a kind of anti-institutional populism. But in both cases, the stated ideology becomes hollow once everything revolves around preserving the leader’s image and authority.  So maybe the deeper truth is: ideology gets weaponized, but ultimately discarded, when authoritarianism takes hold. The loyalty isn't to principle.

"The truth is far more sinister than that. Democracy in the United States is a form of mind control. The word democracy is not in the constitution. The founding fathers published stories about democracy and every time they were in public they told the people that they were going to create a democracy. If you read the Constitution you will learn the word democracy will not be found. And the reason why the Constitution does not mention democracy is because the United States is not a democracy. The United States was created as a representative Republic. There is a problem with that as Thomas Jefferson noted in his letter to John Taylor in 1816.   Thomas Jefferson wrote:    “The purest republican feature in the government of our own state is the House of Representatives. the Senate is equally so the 1st year, less the 2d and so on.”  [The House of Representatives is the most democratic part of our government. The Senate starts out just as democratic, but becomes less so over time.]       “The Executive still less, because not chosen by the people directly. the Judiciary seriously antirepublican because for life; and the national Arm wielded, as you observe by Military leaders, irresponsible but to themselves.”  [The president is even less democratic because people don’t vote for the president directly. Judges are even less democratic because they keep their jobs for life. The military is run by leaders who only answer to themselves.]       “Add to this the vicious constitution of our county courts (to whom the justice, the executive administration, the taxation, police, the military appointments of the county, and nearly all our daily concerns are confided) self appointed, self continued, holding their authorities for life, and with an impossibility of breaking in on the perpetual succession of any faction once possessed of the bench.”  [County officials in charge of courts, taxes, police, and the military pick themselves, keep their jobs for life, and it’s almost impossible for anyone else to take their place.]       “And add also that one half of our brethren who fight and pay taxes, are excluded, like Helots, from the rights of representation; as if society were instituted for the soil, and not for the men inhabiting it; or one half of these could dispose of the rights, & the will, of the other half, without their consent.”  [Half of the people who fight in wars and pay taxes aren’t allowed to vote or have a say in government, as if the government is for the land, not the people, or as if one group can control the other without their permission.]       “What constitutes a State? ... No: Men, high minded men; Men, who their duties know; But know their rights; and knowing, dare maintain. These constitute a State.”  [A real state isn’t about buildings or walls—it’s about people who know and stand up for their rights.]       “Much, then, the control of the people over the organs of their government be the measure of its republicanism, and I confess I know no other measure, it must be agreed that our governments have much less of republicanism than ought to have been expected; in other words, that the people have less regular control over their agents, than their rights and their interests require.”  [How much the people control the government shows how democratic it is. Right now, people don’t have as much control as they should.]       “On this view of the import of the term republic, instead of saying, as has been said, ‘that it may mean anything or nothing,’ we may say, with truth and meaning, that governments are more or less republican as they have more or less of the element of popular election and control in their composition: & believing, as I do, that the mass of the citizens is the safest depository of their own rights, & especially that the evils flowing from the duperies of the people are less injurious than those from the egoism of their agents, I am a friend to that composition of government which has in it the most of this ingredient.”  [A government is more democratic the more it lets people vote and control things. I believe regular people are the best protectors of their own rights, and mistakes by the people are less harmful than selfishness from government officials.]       “And I sincerely believe with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; & that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.”  [Banks are more dangerous than armies, and making future generations pay for today’s government debt is like cheating them.]  Now read the encyclopedia Britannica's section on fascism and let me know what you think:  https://www.britannica.com/topic/fascism",radio-act1v,2025-04-16T21:07:58,0

"Slightly revised input: “Recently, I’ve seen many people compare Trump 2.0 to Maoism. Is the comparison valid? In reality there seem to be very few similarities between the current Trump admin and Maoism?”  You’re right to be skeptical about that comparison—it’s provocative, but on closer inspection, it doesn’t really hold up in a substantive or literal sense.  Maoism, as a political ideology, is a branch of Marxism-Leninism with a focus on permanent revolution, peasant-based class struggle, anti-elitism, and mass mobilization. It emphasizes centralized state control over the economy, radical social reordering, and often violent purges of perceived enemies, especially intellectuals and “capitalist roaders.”  Trump 2.0, or the current iteration of Trump’s political movement, is essentially right-wing populism with strong nationalist, anti-immigration, and anti-globalist themes. It favors deregulation, tax cuts, cultural traditionalism, and hostility to elite institutions—especially the media, academia, and elements of the federal bureaucracy (“deep state”).",Delam2,2025-04-15T05:34:44,0

"A series of facts does not make one right.   „Trump is the modern Genghis Khan. Like the Mongol warlord, he rose from outsider status to dominate a broken political landscape, forging a loyal tribal base through sheer will and personal allegiance. Both men shattered elite norms, weaponized fear, and thrived on chaos. Trump uses media shock and relentless disruption the way Khan used cavalry and terror—ruthlessly, strategically, and without apology. He doesn’t follow the rules; he rewrites them. Where Genghis reshaped the world order with force, Trump does it with power politics, spectacle, and relentless personal branding. The methods are different, but the energy is the same: conquest through domination.“  By the way don’t take from this that I love Trump, I hate the guy, just don’t like the casual use of AI in this way.",Delam2,2025-04-15T05:48:50,2
