"4D Chess move by our orange furher. By driving out the family farms, who voted for the ruination of their businesses btw so don't feel bad for them, that'll create some space for those imaginary factories that the tariffs will bring!    But in all seriousness, even with a bailout those farms are fucked. Because of Trump's liberation day stunt, it'll be difficult for farmers to sell their product overseas since other nations could buy their food or whatever from somewhere else. Like China could easily just buy soybeans from Brazil instead of the US. A stable income stream is far more reliable in the long term than some check from the government. Even with bailouts, that's income that the farmers will never see again unless the next administration tries to repair our geopolitical relationships.    MAGA gained power through the promise of American isolationism. I really hope these past ~100 days have made everyone realize how important geolitics are in our daily lives. The average midwit could easily say ""oh well i dont give a fuck about them australians wat dey do doesnt affect me."" But in reality, it does matter and how well a president handles relationships with other nations can affect our job markets and economy bigly. It's why the ideology of MAGA just doesn't work, and why Trump's attempt at launching tariffs against the entire planet was a really stupid move. Even if it's just about ""cutting a deal"" it's still a stupid move since America has the largest military, a strong economy, the world's most used reserve currency, etc. Trump already had all the cards he needed to cut new deals with other countries which makes Liberation day dumber in hindsight. MAGA may have worked in the stone age, but it does not work in the modern world. These farmers shot themselves in the foot by going with MAGA.",SolarBoyDjango,2025-05-08T07:00:08,7

They are businessmen first a foremost.  They almost all unilaterally voted for Trump.  But here is the catch, when I look up the subsidies these farms rake in, it’s a shell game.  One of my friends has a “family farm” it’s like 18000 acres, and also voted for Trump.  In the last 5 years they have taken in massive subsidies in the millions of dollars. His little trade stunt with China in his first term cost them nothing bc they were made whole, by you and I, to the tune of 28B.  I really hope they all suffer and I have told them that.

"It's zero-sum vs non-zero sum thinking.    Zero Sum is like a pizza.  There is only a single pizza with 8 slices, and for someone to have more pizza means that someone will have less.  They view helping others as giving other people more pieces of pizza, leaving less for them.  There is only so much of something around, and for others to have more means others have to have less.  Non-zero sum thinking is that the parts of an interaction can be mutually beneficial to both parties.  Think of a Pizza shop owner who doesn't see many pizza sales early in the week, so they have a special 2 for 1 sale on Mondays.  A budget-conscious student then buys 2 pizzas on mondays, one for Monday and one for leftovers later in the week.  The Pizza show owner gained profit that he wouldn't otherwise have gotten on a Monday night, and the student gained Pizza and dinner for two days.  Both people benefited from this arrangement!   Most things are non-zero sum interactions, mutually beneficial interactions where all members are better for it, but some people are stuck on how every interaction must have a winner and a loser, and are struggling how to figure out who was the winner\loser in the above Monday 2 for 1 sale.
