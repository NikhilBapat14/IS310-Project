"Not ""toward"" authoritarianism. Trump crossed that line when he started ignoring due process and disappearing people into foreign prisons. We have an authoritarian leader now, and straight from the Authoritarian Leader Playbook, Trump is going after lawyers and judges now. Universities....civil servants....legal professionals...the press...these are the institutions that authoritarians always target.  Trump's come to power by election and now is turning us into an autocracy--very much like Orban in Hungary.",FIlm2024,2025-04-25T21:26:42,53
"Bernie, my man, fascist authoritarianism is already here. It started on January 20th.  The Trump administration is now saying ice can raid your home without a warrant and deport Americans without due process and send them to an el Salvador death camp.

Pretty soon he will start a war of conquest to distract from his failing economy.",Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-25T21:31:01,45

"I like how his supporters were so quick to jump up and down about Obama's use of military power and it's constitutional issues.   Or all the HUGE outrage and potential criminality about Hunter and how it was so linked to corruption and a ""crime family"" then after so many accusations upon accusations and in the minute details of playing up simple tip papers as irrefutable facts instead of Russian aligned intentional misinformation.   Yet now when due process is being threatened, you have Republican members of the house absolutely afraid to side with the people because they are too scared of money either losing it or being tarnished by it.  And when Republican controlled states and legislatures enact Draconian barely legal laws and use decorum to silence opposition you hear crickets. Walz is right they don't want freedom for ALL they want privilege for few.   They sure as hell do not want equal justice under the law. Any that dares call themselves a Christian is definitely a hypocrite. There's no escape from what you harbor deep in your soul.

We can severely slow the damage by electing Democrats to a House majority next year (and Senate but that's tougher).  Since you can't time travel, maybe some of these things Dems have done you approve of:  * holding townhalls in their own and red districts and states * holding nominees up in committee * blocking votes in the House (and all but 1 in the Senate) * organizing and attending multiple protests which have brought millions of people out * have helped with over 200 lawsuits against Trump, most of which they've won/winning * won most special elections so far * speaking up on the floor of Congress so information is entered into the official record, including a 25 hour speech * are busy doing media appearances to help inform and educate people * going to El Salvador to try and bring Garcia and the other 250+ prisoners home * going to the immigration camps in Louisiana to check on prisoners and work to get them released",atreeismissing,2025-04-25T21:14:35,23
