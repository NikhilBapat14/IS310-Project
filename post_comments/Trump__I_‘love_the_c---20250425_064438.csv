"Real talk.  We would far more progress eliminating the loopholes the wealthy use to defer and ultimately eliminate their tax liability than by merely monkeying with the rate.  For those that don't know, the easiest, most common, and legal scheme works like this:  At the end of the year, my business is set to pay me out $500k in net income. I don't want to pay taxes on that. Instead, I go buy something I can rent out like a commerical office building and pay cash for it. Now my net income is $0. But I need money, so I go to the bank and take out a loan against the properly. I'm wealthy, so they pencil-whip the underwriting and will loan me 85% - I just was able to borrow back more than I would have kept after taxes. Rent the building out to cover expenses, interest, taxes, etc. That money I borrowed? **Not income**.  So I bet you're thinking, well it'll get taxed eventually right? Wrong. Let's say I decide to sell that building to fund the acquisition of a larger one. It's appreciated nicely, and it's worth $750k now - you're thinking ""A ha! Tax time."" Wrong. I'm going to 1041 Exchange that property into the new one, carrying the capital gain forward and still not pay a dime.  Well, surely I'll pay taxes when I die, right? Or my estate will? Nope. My heirs will get to inherit the property at its current value, not the price I originally paid for it, so the capital gain just evaporates into the ether and no one ever pays a dime of tax on all that money.  Why do you think all the wealthy always go to real estate? Sure, it appreciates but the real reason is the law is set up to let them make their taxes say whatever they want.  And don't even get me started on the way performance based options are taxed. That's the exact same scammy shit - when we let companies buy back their own stock, we gave CEOs the ability to pay themselves whatever they want at 10% or less.",TerryMathews,2025-04-25T09:42:41,3

"Once again conflating people who have yearly incomes of $1MM with people who have managed to aquire $1MM in assets.  The term “millionaire” used to refer to the latter, but these days is used interchangeably to mean the former.  Confusing them is going to cause lots of problems.     For one thing, castigating people who have saved up $1MM+ in 401ks will be bonkers. For fifty years that’s what Americans have been told to do in place of getting a pension benefit.  Anyone retiring today will need $1MM to retire with even minimal comfort - that’s 40 or 50k a year as income.  Portraying those people as fat cats would be ridiculous.       On the other hand people making $1MM per _year_ are very very lucky and raising taxes on that income may make sense.     The problem with saying “raise taxes on millionaires” is it makes the proposal sound like it would impact the middle class, which it actually would not. ",BeowulfShaeffer,2025-04-25T10:59:49,2

The problem is a loopholed tax code that some sectors (biz owners, investment income types, billionaires, etc) are able to exploit to avoid paying their share.

It’s just a small nuisance tax to the wealthy that they could easily absorb with no real impacts to them, but it isn’t about the very small amount of money. It’s about them feeling entitled to not have to pay anything into the system and instead get tax credits and money paid to them from the government because they feel that being wealthy is enough in itself. The burden to pay more falls on the rest in taxes, tariffs (more taxes), fees (yet more taxes), and reductions of services and benefits costing them out of pocket with money they don’t have.   Even a fair percentage of the Republicans and many of the wealthy who would be affected fully support the wealthy paying their fair share, but it isn’t going to ever see the light of day.

"That’s a good analogy. It’s accurate and revealing just how little most of us mean to our governments.   Of course, some are better than others but the US has decided to follow Orban/Erdogan/Putin model. Life is going to get much harder for 90% of the population, already struggling to survive the insane post-COVID society where nothing means anything anymore.  To be honest, I have a really bad feeling this is going to lead to WWIII, and the US is likely to ally with Russia against its historical allies like Canada, Australia, the UK, Japan, South Korea, and Europe, and the entire world may have to fight the Russians and Americans if they essentially carve up the globe based on “spheres of influence” (you take Europe and lots of the Mid-East and Africa; we’ll take North America and some other parts of the Americas that we can extract money from.)   But eventually, Trump will come for everyone. He’s already done this with tariffs, dismantling the civil service and anything in the government he can’t personally control. Science is out; quackery is in, universities are being threatened with billions in federal grants, and intellectuals in all fields are moving to other countries. How does any of this make America great?   Trump really believes that a 130-year economic policy that existed before there was broad prosperity, during the Robber Baron area - the Gilded Age, when a small number of families who are still known today dominated America’s business elite, while everyone else lived in pretty desperate poverty, worked like animals, were taken advantage of, and essentially created a large peasant class.  It is so telling that Trump thinks this is the time in American history that country should aspire to. When 8-year-olds worked in dangerous factories and mines, men who worked industrial jobs had very low life expectancies, due largely to how dangerous and toxic their jobs were, and products killer people all the time because there were no standards or regulators to enforce them.   Jim Crow, the KKK, and lynching all happened regularly in many southern states back then, in this apparently perfect age of greatness. The global trade system was so small compared to the present day that it isn’t even worth discussing it.   To pretend that the current world order the US has actively shaped since the end of the Second World War is an unfair scam for the average American, but the Guilded Age was awesome for them isn’t even worth discussing. It’s just so absurd.   It’s hard to wake up every day living is a world where a cabal of anti-social misanthropes  have decided to destabilize their nation and the world for kicks and kickbacks. It is very hard to take life seriously when the many of the richest and most powerful people on Earth are brain dead MAGA cultists.  I really want America to rise to this occasion and stop the madness before they lose everything and internal as well as widespread global conflict becomes inevitable. I don’t know what it will take because I encounter so much skepticism of direct action. People like claim protest doesn’t work, but it does when it’s so big that no one can ignore it. Think of how many mass civilian demonstrations have brought down entrenched governments and dictatorships over the last fifteen years.

You’d pay $1,900 in taxes and take home $17,100.  You get a raise that makes your salary $21,000, and the $20,001 to $35,000 tax bracket is taxed at 20%. However, this doesn’t mean that your entire salary is now taxed at 20% and that you’d only take home $16,800. Only the amount over $20,000 is taxed at 20%. The first $20,000 are still taxed at the 10%. So you’d be taking home $18,800, which is $20,000 taxed at 10% ($18,000) plus $1000 taxed at 20% ($800)",CorgiMonsoon,2025-04-25T09:04:16,18

Here’s an article about another study from 2022: https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2022-10-31/liberal-state-policies-tied-to-lower-mortality-rates-study-shows  Red states have more murders than blue states: [https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-21st-century-red-state-murder-crisis](https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-21st-century-red-state-murder-crisis).  Another area where Democrats are better is job creation.  Of the four presidents who had the most job creation under their leadership, three of them were Democrats: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs\_created\_during\_U.S.\_presidential\_terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_created_during_U.S._presidential_terms). Republicans agree with me that Democrats are best at job creation. When Trump was elected, Republicans wanted him to keep Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act because of the jobs Biden’s policies had created. [https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/climate/climate-law-trump-republicans/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/climate/climate-law-trump-republicans/index.html).  If Republicans thought Trump would be better for jobs than Biden, they would have let him do what he wanted. Instead, they knew that Democrats were better than Trump at creating jobs.  A fourth area is inflation.  Here’s the worldwide inflation rates: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/256598/global-inflation-rate-compared-to-previous-year/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256598/global-inflation-rate-compared-to-previous-year/),  And here's the US rates [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/).

"That was similar to the older tax bracket system actually until Regan introduced his Trickle Down Economics.

"They don't get better under the Democrats.   Blue states are better places to live, largely because of geography and industry. It has very little to do with government policy, since, outside of Minnesota, Democrats at the state level basically do nothing. Some of it is the legacy of the Democrats from when they weren't so terrible, but most is coincidence.  Red states are poorer, ergo more crime. Not a result of the Republicans being in charge.   I don't care about ""job creation"". What matters is wages. Obama created tons of terrible jobs. So did Biden. But what's happened? Cost of living has gone up while wages have largely stayed stagnant. So there are more jobs where you can't afford to live. Great.   Inflation isn't as important as cost of living, which they do nothing about.  You're doing what the Democrats do, focus on the surface-level BS while ignoring the substance.",Slackjawed_Horror,2025-04-25T08:39:23,1

Removal of a fetus for one’s own health is also called an abortion, even if you meant to get pregnant and really wanted the baby. That’s why abortion is a healthcare issue, though it’s not the only healthcare issue.",ShadowNacht587,2025-04-25T17:30:15,1
">They do not tax the wealthy at significantly higher rates than Republicans.  When their proposals and budget requests have been approved, Democrats have 100% taxed the wealthy at higher rates than Republicans. I am not going to do your research for you. You can start by researching data comps on “top income tax rates”, “capital gains tax”, “billionaire minimum tax rate”, and even “corporate tax rate” if you want to look at businesses. If you want to sort by high earners then look at only individuals above $400k+.   >They claim they want to, then do nothing.  Well, as I said earlier in the thread, when there is a narrow margin which turns into a divided Congress that refuses to approve *anything* beneficial to the people, you can’t get anything done.  >They are lying.  Of course they *do*, both parties lie constantly. I already agreed to that. Republicans just lie more. Both parties are quite terrible. But I think it’s plain to see now that one party is substantially worse than the other, at least at the moment. I’m not even a Democrat and I can see that.  But I don’t really see where they’re “lying” about the taxation aspect here, at least this time. I think more recently Democrats just got thwarted constantly.",KeplingerSkyRide,2025-04-25T08:07:27,5

">It has very little to do with government policy,  The industry you mentioned uses government policy to figure out where to go.  For example, Oklahoma has seen companies refuse to open factories in that state because their workforce lacks the education to understand the work: https://ocpathink.org/post/independent-journalism/public-school-failures-have-ripple-effects-in-workforce.  Meanwhile, Washington is one of the most educated states, which is why tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft like it there: https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/the-10-most-educated-states-in-the-us  Another example of government policy affecting the economy is tariffs.  During Trump's last administration, China responded to Trump's trade war by buying soybeans from Brazil instead of the US. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/trump-trade-war-delivers-farm-boom-in-brazil-gloom-in-iowa.html.  The Trump administration wound up paying more in tariff aid to farmers than it cost to maintain the US nuclear arsenal. https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2020/01/21/trump-tariff-aid-to-farmers-cost-more-than-us-nuclear-forces/.  With Trump’s new tariffs, Asian countries are once again reducing the amount of agricultural products they buy from the US: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/asian-buyers-shun-us-farm-goods-hit-by-ship-crunch-and-trade-war/ar-AA1CzStA?ocid=finance-verthp-feeds  China has started buying beef from Australia instead of the US.  https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-04-12/us-tariffs-war-with-china-australian-beef-exports-up/105166632    >Red states are poorer  Why are they poorer?

"No, they haven't. What are you talking about? Do you have a single example? Other than a small increase under Obama largely caused by the Bush Tax cuts sunsetting? Because they don't. What actually happens is they make a proposal that seems nice, then happily feed it into a shredder to appease the conservatives in their legislative caucus that they actively recruited.  Republicans cut taxes, Democrats refuse to raise them.   Even when they have wide margins, they do the exact same things. You can't keep making excuses for them. They do this every time, and in almost every state even.  If the Democrats got thwarted once or twice, that'd be something. They've been playing this same game for 33 years. The Clinton administration turned them fully into the other business party. Because of their constituency, they still have to pretend they care about the general welfare by doing useless, corrupt bullshit like public-private partnerships that ultimately barely do anything but line the pockets of their owners.   They deliberately recruit conservatives for every political position. They lie and say they have to because doing things like raising taxes or engaging in large-scale public works projects aren't popular, but the reality is they need to make sure the Pelosi's stock portfolio keeps going up and their useless friends keep getting jobs as lobbyists and corporate consultants.   So they have their leadership come out pretending to want to hike taxes, knowing full well that the conservatives they've recruited to the legislature will shred it and if anything goes through it'll be, at most, a 2% increase that they'll do once and never come back to.   It's a show.",Slackjawed_Horror,2025-04-25T08:15:35,-1
