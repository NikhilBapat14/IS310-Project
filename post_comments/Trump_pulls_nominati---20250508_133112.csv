"Trump, probably:  'Ed Martin? I never heard of him, never knew him. Not a lot of people known of him. Perhaps, he is not the guy you say he is, maybe not a guy, at all. A lot of people are saying that he is not a guy, at all. A lot of people.'",Stellar_Stein,2025-05-08T13:59:16,17
"I don't blame the president.  Trump doesn't want people with ties to sympathizers working for him, he wants full blown Nazis like himself.",crazybones,2025-05-08T15:50:21,6
"So he pulls the nomination of Ed Martin. Is there any chance there’s anyone else more unqualified, check Fox News. I know how about [Jeanine Pirro](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanine_Pirro), she’s been a prosecutor, under investigation, accused of corruption, accused of defamation, was suspended by Fox News for remarks, and is fanatically loyal to Trump. She’s perfect for the job and is guaranteed to wreck the Department in no time at all.",johnn48,2025-05-08T16:57:07,3

"The issue is the terminology and at what point one can be considered a ""Nazi"". If you say it's only by the time there were death camps... Then ya... Not a Nazi... yet. But looking at the decade prior to the full Nazi acceptance... We see a LOT of clear signals: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany)  We even have similar coalitions of right wing factions supporting him for their various goals. Include the many Constitutional challenges he's made (that no President before made)... It's sure getting close.   I would call him a work in progress fascist. Does he have the full power that is often the gold standard for being a fascist..? Pretty close. We'll see what happens when a few on the right come out against him publicly. Then again... They may not out of fear. Another trait of the Nazi party.",williamgman,2025-05-08T13:44:51,11
"To be nuanced and fair here, I think the proper complaint would be that Trump enables Nazis.   He’s always refused to criticize the Neo-Nazi and racially motivated part of his base.  I guess it makes sense because in the Obama era those people didn’t vote because the Republicans were “too centrist” and the Republicans lost elections but it’s still not good for society.  People want the Republicans to basically condemn Neo-Nazis and racism and Republicans just won’t do it, no matter how much harm it causes to the social fabric of the country.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-08T13:39:53,8
"He pulled the nomination because he didn't have the votes in the Senate, has nothing to do with the views of the candidate.   >In his remarks on Thursday, Trump praised Martin as a “terrific person” and “really outstanding.” And he said he was “disappointed” that Martin didn’t get the support he needed to get him confirmed. “But that’s the way it works sometimes, Trump said.   >Trump, who didn’t disavow Martin, said he might appoint him for another job at the Justice Department, to a role that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.",TheBoosThree,2025-05-08T14:54:27,3

"Yeah, I don't think Trump is a nazi, but i absolutely believe he's knowingly in the company of nazis, and that's bad enough for me. Ntm he's obviously a fascist",Untimed_Heart313,2025-05-08T14:52:01,3
His father was arrested in 1927 during a Ku Klux Klan riot.  So maybe he was just gargling their balls or he was member.,gabechoud_,2025-05-08T17:02:22,6
