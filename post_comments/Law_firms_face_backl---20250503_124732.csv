They shouldn't have caved. Good on Perkins Coie for not bowing down to Von Shitzenpants.,LolAtAllOfThis,2025-05-03T12:50:17,58
"Why would anyone pay a law firm that caves to illegal threats?  Their very existence, and the welfare of their clients, hinges on their ability to fight to the best of their ability based on the rule of law.    Every firm that caved to Trump has shown that they do not care one iota about preserving rights under the law, but only about their own bottom line.  And even then, they are extraordinarily stupid to think that giving into Trump will ever be good for their long term security.",YesterShill,2025-05-03T14:27:04,33
"Yep, that is their own fault.  A lot of them didn't even try..",coatofforearm,2025-05-03T13:19:31,20
Maybe some firms will start backing out of whatever agreement they made since they know they’re gonna win in court against his illegal executive orders,StrDstChsr34,2025-05-03T17:42:14,2
not surprised at all law firms always end up catching heat when they work with controversial clients especially someone like Trump. the backlash is kinda expected at this point.,ProudSexyLady,2025-05-03T13:25:46,6
I am just imagining the amounts the next Democrats can get from the firms who caved.,tommyjaspers,2025-05-03T13:24:49,2

They would have to give up their firms. Flip flopping lawyers = bad lawyers,beadzy,2025-05-03T18:34:07,1
"> when they work with controversial clients especially someone like Trump.   They didn't 'work' with him - he wasn't their client paying them.  He threatened them. They folded.  They clearly don't think their own lawyers are smart/effective enough to protect the rule of law, why would anyone else want to hire them?",m0nk_3y_gw,2025-05-03T14:21:03,21
"[Full Order](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.184.0.pdf)  > DECLARED that Executive Order 14230, 90 Fed. Reg. 11781 (Mar. 11, 2025), issued by the President on March 6, 2025, entitled ""Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,"" is unlawful because it violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and is therefore null and void;  [Decision](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.185.0.pdf)  Footnote from page 3  > This message has been heard and heeded by some targeted law firms, as reflected in their choice, after reportedly direct dealings with the current White House, to agree to demand terms, perhaps viewing this choice as the best alternative for their clients and employees. Yet, some clients may harbor reservations about the implications of such deals for the vigorous and zealous representation to which they are entitled from ethically responsible counsel, since at least the publicized deal terms appear only to forestall, rather than eliminate, the threat of being targeted in an Executive Order. As amici former and current general counsel caution, a ""fundamental premise of the rule of law"" is that ""when parties challenge the government, their lawyers 'opposel] the designated representatives of the State,' and '[the system assumes that adversarial testing will ultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness.' This safeguard against government overreach fails when attorneys cannot 'advanc[e] the undivided interests of [their] client[s]' for fear of reprisal from the government."" Br. of Amici Curiae Former & Current General Counsel Supporting Pl. Perkins Coie, LLP at 9-10, ECF No. 99 (alterations in original; internal citation omitted) (quoting Polk County v. Dodson, 454 U.S. 312, 318-19 (1981)).  > Only when lawyers make the choice to challenge rather than back down when confronted with government action raising non-trivial constitutional issues can a case be brought to court for judicial review of the legal merits, as was done in this case by plaintiff Perkins Coie LLP, plaintiff's counsel Williams & Connolly, and the lawyers, firms, organizations, and individuals who submitted amicus briefs in this case. As one amicus aptly put it, ""[o]ur judicial system is under serious threat when determining whether to file an Amicus Curiae brief could be a career ending decision. But, when lawyers are apprehensive about retribution simply for filing a brief adverse to the government, there is no other choice but to do so."" Amicus Curiae Br. of Pickering Legal LLC in Supp. of Pl.'s  CONCLUSION from page 102  > The U.S. Constitution affords critical protections against Executive action like that ordered in EO 14230. Government officials, including the President, may not ""subject] individuals to ""retaliatory actions' after the fact for having engaged in protected speech."" Hous. Cmty. Coll. Sys., 595 U.S. at 474 (quoting Nieves, 587 U.S. at 398). They may neither ""use the power of the State to punish or suppress disfavored expression,"" Vullo, 602 U.S. at 188, nor engage in the use of ""purely personal and arbitrary power,"" Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 370. In this case, these and other foundational protections were violated by EO 14230. On that basis, this Court has found that EO 14230 violates the Constitution and is thus null and void. For the reasons explained, plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment and declaratory and permanent injunctive relief on Counts II through IX of the Amended Complaint. The government's motion to dismiss is denied,  There are a number of firms who have TRO’s against his Extortion Orders. This is the first that has made it through to a decision.  Microsoft has pulled representation from one of the firms that caved in. I wouldn’t be surprised if other firms do not see business impacts from showing they are not willing to vigorously advocate against this administration.",BringOn25A,2025-05-03T13:31:01,4
