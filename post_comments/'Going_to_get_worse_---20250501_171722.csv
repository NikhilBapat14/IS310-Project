heres an interesting fact in the arctic the Inuit throw out the polar bear liver as eating it will kill them. The reason for this is because of its high vitamin A concentration which is deadly in high doses.,Tasty_Bite1984,2025-05-02T03:04:26,1

"Now that most people don’t test anymore, because they don’t have to or can’t afford to, anyone can and probably will damage or kill someone by infecting them Covid at some point. It’s been normalized and almost everyone went along with it. On the contrary, protecting one’s health is on the verge to be criminalized, while there’s no cure or help for people with long covid. On the contrary, research has been largely cut.   I view the last two to three years as an exercise in loss of empathy, but that’s what the virus does to our brains anyways.

Stephen Miller is mostly Grima Wormtongue whispering in White House ears and screaming on Fox news, but most of the evil shit the Trump regime is doing would have been and will be done anyway even without the slimy ""influence"" of his pet Nazi.   RFK has killed people even before the Trump regime, is currently killing people, and plans to kill way more people.",HPLREH777,2025-05-01T18:34:12,6
Correct. Measles have the ability to remove people's immunity with previous diseases. That's why it's a very dangerous disease.   Why the fuck is RFK Jr. so stupid? He's making comparisons to his youth where measles flourished as a sign of it being normal. It's a terrible argument.  It's frustrating because two kids died when they didn't have to die and more are going to die as this policy moves forward.,Socratic_Method_729,2025-05-01T22:26:27,2
