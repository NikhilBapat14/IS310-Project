"This is a fantasy we shouldn't engage in.  They are confident and will keep waving that MAGA flag even as the ship burns to the water.  They are fully inoculated against criticism of Trump or acknowledging his failures.    If we're going to come back next year, we need to win people over with practical solutions for the universal problems most Americans are facing.  ""We're not those idiots!"" is not a winning campaign slogan.",CriticalTruthSeeker,2025-05-03T10:17:01,15

We got put in the position we're in because we've refused to address the massive problems facing most Americans and have instead focused on tribal virtue signaling.  Harris had no chance of winning.  No real vision or ideas and no charisma.   It is going to take an FDR level of vision and purpose to get us out of the wilderness.,CriticalTruthSeeker,2025-05-08T23:35:03,1
