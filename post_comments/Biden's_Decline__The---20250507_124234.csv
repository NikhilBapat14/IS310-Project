"How ""democrats lost america"".....more like ""How America Ended""   And Trump is showing more signs of dementia than Biden ever did, yet no republican media source is ever going to tell that story or make daily rage memes about it, or edit clips of Trump to blast all over social media about his dementia......

"Biden is ancient, trump is going to be even older when this term is up. Both are clearly mentally unwell. So how about we just do what's clearly needed and create a law so that no one over the age of America's current life expectancy minus 8 years can run for president?

"Meanwhile, we cant even look at trump as a real person as he has been institutionalized by wealth his entire life. Dude believes what he sees on tv is real.

"The hiding of Biden's decline within his inner circle should be illuminated further. His public appearances weren't particularly shocking until the debate, and it seems that actual journalists were misled as well.   Trump's current authoritarian regime is a much larger concern at present, but we also shouldn't repeatedly have presidents hiding significant medical issues.",Ratermelon,2025-05-07T13:09:28,1

"Republicans and right wingers never got the memo that most Democrats never fucking cared about Biden at all.  Republicans nearly universally worship Trump personally and cannot grasp the concept that we never cared about Biden beyond his ability to keep fascists out and pass some policies that would help America.  Trump accurately bragged that he could shoot someone in broad daylight and not lose his supporters.  Biden could have accurately bragged that he could bench press 300 pounds, held the worlds record for smartest man, and had given a kidney to a starving orphan and Democrats would not really change our opinion on him for the better.  ""Your dude would have wandered off had white house aides not put tape on the floor to direct him"" Bro, I don't fucking care if he was catatonic for the last 20 years, none of us do. If he had passed a New Green Deal I'd have wanted his face on quarters.  We never really liked the guy, he was just useful.  It's all straw man arguments in the right wing reality bubble. They assume we all have Biden and Harris tattoed on our left and right buttcheeks respectively and still care very deeply about what those two are up to. Yesterday on Fox they were chuckling about Harris going to the Met Gala like they were owning the libs by dunking on someone most libs disliked due to her stance on Gaza.",pingpongballreader,2025-05-07T13:37:14,6

"Dude. Biden appeared to be 1,000 times more demented than Trump ever has. Biden could not put a coherent sentence together in the debate in front of the entire country. It's just objective facts. I hate Trump and I do not think he's mentally stable, and I do think his intellectual abilities are graded on a curve because he's said insane incoherent shit for more than a decade. But Biden appeared 1,000 times worse than Trump whether or not that's true. So of course they're going to report on Biden more than Trump in this regard because Biden was so obviously getting too old to do the job.",Zestyclose-Rub8932,2025-05-07T13:00:50,-13

"This is still a conspiracy theory without basis. Biden acted _old_ in the debate, not riddled with dementia. The number of people who have never dealt with or witnessed dementia or Alzheimer's yet demand to be treated as experts because they watched a debate once is astounding.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T13:57:10,1
"“Objective facts” based on what?  Trump gets a pass because he can string together sentences with more confidence or by speaking loudly?  Give me a break.  “Ofcourse theyre going to report on Biden more” ah yes, ofcourse.  The guy who isn’t president currently def needs to be reported on more than the current president with mental issues.  Very smart",Extreme-Property1707,2025-05-07T13:07:35,9
"I wouldn't say that Biden appeared significantly worse than Trump at the debate, but rather that Biden's decline was more apparent. Biden displayed a much higher level of functioning than Trump through maybe mid-2023.   As you pointed out, Trump doesn't have this perception problem as much because he's been low-functioning for more than a decade. Additionally, many of his apologist cultists will defend his rambling about the dumbest shit such as his braindead gullibility regarding the edited image of Abrego Garcia's fist.",Ratermelon,2025-05-07T13:21:57,5
"Biden was suffering from Covid during the debate. And Biden almost always corrects what he says when he fumbled words. But the things Biden actually talked about were cogent, lucid, well thought out, and 1000 times more fact based than the word salad nonsense that comes out of trump's mouth.   Like how can you sit there and say Biden fumbling words, is ""objectively factually"" *worse* than Trump saying blatant false and insane things like ""Immigrants eating pets"" or any of the 10,000 insane conspiratorial nonsensical word salads that come out of his mouth.   Please tell me one thing Biden said that was worse than Trump claiming there were airports during the revolutionary war? Bet you can't do it. Or worse than Trump claiming immigrants are eating pets. Or actively believing Garcia's tattoos say the words ""MS13"" on them when they were photoshopped by Trump's own administration.   It's dementia dude. Trump is literally incapable of discerning reality from fiction.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-07T13:42:29,2

"There's a firm basis for Biden having declined over the latter half of his term. The New Yorker piece, numerous claims from Democrats around him, and my own eyes tell me that Biden was not fit to run by the time of the debate.  He didn't act demented, but something was neurologically wrong with him.",Ratermelon,2025-05-07T17:10:39,1
">Trump gets a pass because he can string together sentences with more confidence or by speaking loudly?   It's not fair, obviously, but what you're describing is an optics problem, and one that Trump benefitted from massively.  Simply put, bullshit said confidently is generally more alluring and convincing than the truth said less confidently. It's bizarre, but that is the state of things.",jayfeather31,2025-05-07T13:23:09,1
"Biden was just low energy and fumbled words. But the things biden actually said and talked about were 1000% more factual and based in reality than any of the word salad conspiratorial made-up BS that comes out of Trump's mouth.   And a LOT of the stuff on the internet and youtube accusing Biden of dementia was carefully edited videos by Right wing media that were completely false.   For example, they loved to claim biden was ""Shaking hands with air"", but when you watch the full video he was gesturing to the audience to stand up, he then turns to the other crowd section, makes the same hand gesture and they stand up and applaud. But of course Fox News and Right wing idiots cherry picked one camera angle of Biden opening his hand and then cut the rest off. Cause they're a bunch of lying liars and Trump supporters are a bunch of gullible hypocritical rubes that just blindly believe that stuff.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-07T13:46:19,4
"I mean, there was certainly a social media campaign designed to make Biden look disabled, but that debate made it seem pretty unlikely that he's ok.",Ratermelon,2025-05-07T17:05:16,1
"I mean, he sounded pretty lucid in later off the cuff interviews. And the problem isn't so much that he's old and with a slower working brain.   The problem is that Trump is 100 times worse with the things he says that are blatantly false, insane, and completely unhinged from anything resembling reality.   It's the utter hypocrisy and double standards of the right, to rage about Biden's age for years and the flubs he makes in speech, but then turnaround and elect an OLDER guy who makes way more word flubs and just invents complete unhinged made up nonsense on the regular.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-07T18:34:05,1
