"Those countries would have no problem kicking out American students for less.  The crimes listed are pretty serious.  Yeah, get their asses home.",j3remy2007,2025-04-29T15:29:56,100
"FTA:  >“There were cases like where it was not a serious thing, like littering, or somebody had charges that were dropped, where we didn’t revoke those.  so presumably in this case the ""criminal record"" statement is actually referring to convictions. (not sure if arrests/indictments show up on a criminal record or not, but if they aren't including cases where the charges were dropped, it seems like a safe bet arrest but no charges wasn't included either).  seems like a reasonable bar to set and something that SHOULD be non-controversial (though i'm sure people will find some reason to freak out and insist the sky is falling).",reaper527,2025-04-29T14:29:54,71
"If you come here legally, you should not be breaking any laws.  If being here illegally gets you deported, then at least when you are here legally, but break the law, you too should be deported.",mdws1977,2025-04-29T14:32:17,57
So exactly like what would happen to you in every other country.  the dems/libs are not good people,troubledtimez,2025-04-29T18:48:37,9
"The Trump administration has revoked the visas of 4,000 foreign students in its first 100 days — the bulk of which have committed crimes in the US including arson, assault and robbery, The Post has learned.  More than 90% of the rogue students who saw their visas nixed had committed crimes such as arson, wildlife and human trafficking, child endangerment, domestic abuse, DUI and robbery, a senior State Department source told The Post Monday.  More than 500 of them had assault raps.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-29T15:47:54,23
"Remember, visas are issued at the grace of the State Department. Nobody has a right to a visa. Due process does not apply to visa revocations. The secretary of state could legally require that every visa holder wear a MAGA hat, and there would be no question about the legality, except from liberals.  The Libs are like lawyers. When they don't have facts, they argue the law. When they don't have the law on their side, they argue ""the facts"". Phooey. Their on-demand amnesia is disgusting.",Device_whisperer,2025-04-29T15:05:58,21
Good. Always welcome to come here and learn and give back to society. Not create a ruckus and break laws of the land.,Outrageous_Skirt9963,2025-04-29T14:40:57,22

"Cue the Dems crying about how they ""paid for their crimes"" and how as a country we should be teaching them to be better. Fuck that, not our job to improve people who don't belong here.",LurkerNan,2025-04-29T21:16:57,3
">countries would have no problem kicking out American students for less.   Or send them to hard labor camps for over a year over an unproven accusation and then returning them to America, basically brain-dead",sowellpatrol,2025-04-30T00:33:26,17
Dismissed charges did trigger the revocation but those were granted TRO and later restored. However the initial revocations were over broad and some students with minor traffic charges got hit.,One_Butterscotch8981,2025-04-30T02:56:51,14
