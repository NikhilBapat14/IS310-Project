"> Police Chief Brian O’Hara voiced frustration about DA Mary Moriarty deciding not to charge Adams with what would have been felony counts.  > “The Minneapolis Police Department did its job,” O’Hara said. “It identified and investigated a crime trend, identified and arrested a suspect, and presented a case file to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office for consideration of charges”  > “This case impacted at least six victims and totaled over $20,000 in damages. Any frustration related to the charging decision of the Hennepin County Attorney should be directed solely at her office”  > “Our investigators are always frustrated when the cases they poured their hearts into are declined. In my experience, the victims in these cases often feel the same.”  Imagine doing all that work and the DA just slaps them in the wrist. There are *six victims* — where is their justice? The cops sound pissed — I know I would be.  Criminals are always remorseful, but the guy is a *government employee* and apparently also gets to keep his job? Like what? Excuse me?",Blarghnog,2025-04-22T13:18:17,86

"So, for my day job, I work for a school district that has a morals clause in my employment agreement.  That means that if I were to be arrested and charged for something like DUI, drug possession, etc, I can be fired for cause.  I don't agree with the diversion program option the DA chose but no word on whether this guy lost his government job over this?  He admitted his guilt so there's no question he did these things and most civil service employees have language like this in their employment agreements.",Euroranger,2025-04-22T12:22:10,35
