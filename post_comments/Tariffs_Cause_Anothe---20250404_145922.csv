">Investors did not get the rebound from Thursday‚Äôs historic losses they may have hoped  I have money invested in the stock market for retirement, and I wasn't hoping for a rebound.   I want it to keep falling next week. Until finally some of the wealthy people who own some congressional Republicans get them to cross the aisle to the Democratic side to stop these tariffs.  Because of that happens, the market will eventually come back up most of the way. But if the tariffs are fully implemented, and we keep going forward with Trump's disastrous plan, it's not coming back.",raistlin65,2025-04-04T18:16:23,2

"Stephen Miller probably blames Jews for the Holocaust and I mean that seriously. He was born into a Jewish family whose ancestors fled the persecution in Europe in the early 20th century. According to USA Today ""When Miller's Jewish family fled the horrors of Jewish persecution in Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century, according to Guerrero, they found refuge in the United States.¬†""  He is the only racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic person born into a Jewish family that I ever knew of.

"In case you employer matches all or part of your 401(k), you could try riskier investments once Trump is gone, or at least neutered by the expected Republican loss of House of Representatives majority in 2026.
