Crushing small businesses. Big box stores will probably get bailed out. Main Street business will have no merchandise to sell.,fairoaks2,2025-05-03T22:27:32,45
"The trucking industry is about to crash. And crash hard. Companies are rushing to get as much product as they can before tariffs start to bite. Bc once they do. It's over. We have more truckers in the US than cops, firefighters, and ems. What's going to happen when half that workforce gets cut and there isn't any jobs to go to.",lucasjatreides,2025-05-04T00:55:09,27

Truck drivers comprise the largest employment category in the US and the flow on effect to demand and unemployment will be enormous.   Their Trump endorsing union leadership should hang their heads in shame and resign before being thrown out.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T23:54:32,21

"The owners get bailed out, and their employees may get scraps. Even some of the bigger stores (Walmart, etc) are closing stores. Then again, this has been happening for some time now.   Also, one can't buy stuff from the bigger stores either if many lose their jobs or have hours cut. The products will just sit there.",Boo_Radley80,2025-05-03T23:19:53,13
That's the goal. Run all the small businesses out of business so there's nothing left but giant corporations.,yourlittlebirdie,2025-05-03T22:30:50,17

"I have a feeling that's going to be years before it gets approved. Even then I would assume they would have a human for just in case emergencies. But yeah, that shit is  definitely going to be here sooner or later.",lucasjatreides,2025-05-04T01:10:57,3
Automation and AI will spell the end of so many jobs that there will not enough consumer demand to keep the economy afloat. Add to this an ageing population and the current economic model becomes redundant.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T01:30:50,2
"Uh, one truck is on the road without a human *last week* and they are expanding by the end of the year.  They had 1200 miles without humans last Thursday.",Weak-Regular7772,2025-05-04T01:14:28,7
In Texas right? Interstate is another story I think. I’m curious to know what the cost of entry is to this technology. It’s likely cheaper to run a contract to a mom and pop shop than buy an automated platform like this. I’m sure medium to larger companies will take advantage of this but much of the freight in the US is connected by smaller operations. Will is force them out? Maybe but not until prices drop.,sneaky_sheikhy,2025-05-04T02:16:28,5
