They are however always 1st in line crying about need of government help when shit hits the fan... except instead of recognizing that their dismantling of critical programs, and systems are to blame they default to that first bit in followup screeching.   There is also an additional layer to in in terms of a ""rules for thee, but not for me"" mentality where they want all of those benefits while denying them for other... or to otherwise say they want to abuse others for personal benefit with 0 consequence to self.   It all goes way back too like back in the civil rights era tons of communities had segregated public pools, and parks... what happened when segregation, and Jim crow laws became illegal. the jackasses voted to get rid of those public services, and institutions. They were all for public schools, but once they could not exclude others they hated they started pushing tax payer paid vouchers for private institutions type of nonsense...   Other things like accelerationism plays right in to that.",Competitive_Oil_649,2025-05-04T19:38:46,3
"Come on, man, he at least has the good sense to not use nuclear weapons over nothing.  Why do you think he never used nukes against any other countries he's bombed or otherwise been mad at?  In any case, if Trump did use nuclear weapons against Greenland there's still no possibility that the UK or France would retaliate with nuclear weapons.  It would be suicidal for those countries.    I'm from the UK, I like Denmark, but I'm not willing to live in the apocalypse for it to keep an overseas possession.  The Americans can have it.",Tetracropolis,2025-05-05T06:28:03,1
"agreed, that's a good summary of what's happening within America.  Externally, the ""system to be burned down"" is the geopolitical and economic global system the US was instrumental on making.  When Trump claims to be the victim of other countries ""ripping off America"", he's talking about the very system the US built and prosper on for more than half a century.",Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-04T21:51:18,2
