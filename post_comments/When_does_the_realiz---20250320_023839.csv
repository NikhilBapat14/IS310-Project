When people should notice: - When they start making excuses to eliminate term limits for the president.  - when the corruption that they used to at least try to obfuscate is done openly and bragged about - when they start getting along with other authoritarians rather than other democratically elected leaders  - when government funds are used to prop up the ruling party  I can’t speak for when they do notice.

"There is nothing worse for people than losing their freedom of speech. In fact, it goes beyond speech—it’s the loss of all freedoms, even a sense of self. Under such conditions, people live like zombies, unable to achieve even their smallest dreams without the president’s permission. Simple aspirations, like traveling, getting a job, or owning a car, become unattainable. Step by step, an authoritarian regime makes daily life unbearable, reducing people to thinking only about how to put food on the table and pay their bills. New laws and policies are introduced to suppress dissent; Anyone who criticizes the government or the president is labeled a terrorist and a threat to national security. Such individuals are often imprisoned for years, sometimes even decades, without the right to see their families. This harsh treatment serves as a warning to others, discouraging anyone from daring to speak out against the regime. Many of them die under torture, subjected to unimaginable suffering as a means of silencing dissent and instilling fear in the population. This brutal reality is designed to crush any hope of resistance and ensure complete submission to the regime. It often begins with granting the president the right to extend their term limits indefinitely. Then, the judiciary and Supreme Court are brought under the president’s control. Additionally, the regime strengthens the national army and ensures a loyal relative is placed at its helm, eliminating the risk of a military coup.",Beginning-Initial676,2025-03-26T23:39:12,1
"Probably when the governing documents are changed to alter the system of government.  Xi in China changed the constitution to become president for life.  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-43361276  Putin in Russia changed the constitution to become president for life.  https://theconversation.com/how-vladimir-putin-was-able-to-change-russias-constitution-and-become-president-for-life-247654  If we change the U.S. Constitution to make Trump President for life, I'd imagine people will come to the realization that the government system changed.  Until then, we still have a President exercising lawful authority under Article II, and a Court system checking instances of executive overreach by issuing injunctions. Our cultural and constitutional tradition is strong and is designed for longevity. Trump is transitory, and the reactionary doomerism about living in an authoritarian dictatorship is overblown and disconnected from reality.  Now, if Trump consistently and deliberately disobeys court orders (Alien Enemies Act deportations are the first attempt), then we have a problem.

"True. When did we give up on the idea of ""unfit parents""? Shortly after we accepted the absurdity that you can (and must) reason with a 5-year-old followed by deciding we should just go along with the impulse-control-deprived toddlers and let them advance to the next grade regardless of what they learned (or not). Then when we saw how kids enjoyed teachers with no power to punish in a meaningful (to the kid) way, we removed that power from parents who gave up trying to teach their kids how to behave in regard to anyone who should have authority over their behavior (like teachers and parents), and then decided all adults had to make the kids ""feel comfortable"" and if they did not, punish the unenlightened adults.  Only took a couple generations to get one that is totally ego-centric and impulse driven to the point they will become violent with anyone who tells them what they can or cannot do and will follow any leader who feeds their need for what they call ""freedom"" no matter it is totally incompatible with Civilization.  Is there any connection with all this Dr Spock approach to raising our young and the fact we have never won a war or seriously improved our society since we gave up on the notion of discipline and enforcing the good of Society over the whims of the individual? Yeah, we passed the Civil Rights Act, but we almost immediately gave up seriously penalizing those who ignore it.

Deciding to not attend family diners, clean their rooms, not go visit a friend, ignoring curfews, blowing off school assignments does not make your child a better adult. I'll just leave you with the story from a nice grandma who worked for me back in he 70's. Her 5-year-old granddaughter was told if she wanted to learn about the porcelain chests and figurines on the shelves, Grandma would take them down and they could look together, but she was NOT to bother them by herself. Very shortly thereafter, the child had taken down a large chest and was examining it when to her amazement she got a swat on her backside, and the cehst was returned to the shelf. Her reaction was to tell Grandma ""You don't love me"", which had worked with her parents, but Grandma replied ""I love you very much, and I want other people to love you too.""  Discipline is a big part of the glue that holds our society together. Too many kids never learned that their actions had consequences until it was way too late.
