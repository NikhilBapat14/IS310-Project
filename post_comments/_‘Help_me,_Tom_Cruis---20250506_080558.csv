"The irony is that the US market IS already the least diverse market for films. When is that last time you seen foreign language films on wide theatrical release?  [Here's a random Beijing theater](http://www.ume.com.cn/) I googled. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see the current showings.  I'm counting:       3 Japanese films        1 Russian film        1 Spanish film           1 American film        and finally 4 Chinese films  In other instances, there's even Bollywood and french films. And this is not just a one-off random international cinema,[ a lot of Chinese cinemas](http://english.entgroup.cn/boxoffice/cn/daily/) shows a diverse international showings. It's no wonder they have to limit the slots for US films.  Show me any Cinemark or Regal or AMC with just as diverse of international flims showings.",Speak_Of_The_Devil,2025-05-06T08:27:27,6
"Let's get this straight, he presumably came up with the idea for the tariff and reopening Alcatraz after watching Escape From Alcatraz, a movie that was filmed on location at Alcatraz. So, his goal is to bring filmmaking back to the US while actively taking away locations to film at. I guess it makes sense if you don't think about it.",SharpNSlick,2025-05-06T08:28:05,2
"This is going to fuck over Netflix and Amazon prime. Shows like Arcane have a huge chunk of their animations done in asian countries like South Korea.   Bezo really likes to take from behind and still thank his God-Emperor, apparently.",theassassintherapist,2025-05-06T08:31:08,2

"So, the purpose of Trump's tariff is that he just wants more post-apocalyptic movies filmed in an increasingly dystopian US of his own creation?",--John_Yaya--,2025-05-06T09:16:13,0
We need to encourage him to piss off as many fandoms as possible. Imagine if he tries to tariff video games.,HearTheBluesACalling,2025-05-06T13:42:33,0
"I'm a big fan of foreign films but I think you might have cause and effect reversed on why the Chinese theaters have so many films from countries other than China and the US.  For comparison, you might look at what theaters are showing in Paris, Madrid, and Mumbai.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-06T08:30:54,3
"To be fair, while it's not as generally diverse, Cinemark DOES play foreign films.  Just not as widespread, but they do have offerings.  Though I feel like closest regular foreign releases would be Japanese animation stuff, which is offered both in dubbed and subtitled.",metalkhaos,2025-05-06T08:49:24,2
He started Space Force on a stupid suggestion during a presss conference. $30B budget and no one knows what they do besides [sponsoring Indy Cars](https://digbza2f4g9qo.cloudfront.net/-/media/IndyCar/News/Standard/2020/08/08-07-USSF-Joins-ECR-Indy500.jpg?vs=1&d=20200807T120117Z),RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-06T09:41:47,6

"Regal has significantly upped the amount of Bollywood films being shown as well, though not to a wide release and only for a limited time, but most weeks there is at least one. That number will probably drop for this upcoming summer blockbuster season but it’s still a nice increase.",ilikebuffgirls03,2025-05-07T03:24:23,2
