Yikes. Next up is blocking Internet traffic so that Americans can't type in [amazon.fr](http://amazon.fr) to find out what people are paying in other countries.  Why don't we just have a ticketmaster style checkout where you basically role the dice to find out what you'll pay in the end?  Total clarity on that.,CockBrother,2025-04-29T11:38:51,45

"Democrats need to make it clear to corporations, countries, law firms, cabinet members etc. that when they regain power, they will have a scorecard and will be going after all of these fucking enablers and cowards who are obviously convinced that the Democrats will never ever use (or misuse) their power against them the way that the GOP will. This MUST change. Otherwise, this is an even more steep uphill battle.  His entire administration, all these law firms, all these CEOs etc. are operating under the assumption that a Democratic admin will not make them pay for this because we are always above that.  I would love to see prominent Democrats put all these people on notice that they are keeping score and will be settling accounts whenever the party is back in power.

"KKK Karoline Leavitt and toady Bessent strike again. Everything is Biden's fault. BTW, the Biden-era inflation of 2022 was very short-lived and was fueled by spike in demand coming out of the pandemic, with people going back to work + stimulus sent out by the fed government by BOTH Trump and Biden- Trump made sure the checks had HIS name on it, in characteristic narcissistic fashion. Inflation came down fast WITHOUT bringing about the recession everyone predicted, and Biden ended his term with 4% unemployment, 2.6% inflation, and growth in manufacturing jobs.     KKK Karoline, not withstanding her cross around her neck and her professed Christianity, is a liar, a slanderer, an insulter, an a Trump flack through and through. When lying doesn't work, she changes the subject and what-abouts Biden, Obama, and even Hillary Clinton. Hell is too good for her.
