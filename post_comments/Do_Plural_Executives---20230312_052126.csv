"Are you referring to U.S. states that elect multiple statewide office holders, such as electing a governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and the like?  Assuming so, and whistling past the definition of ""better governance,"" it seems that 35/50 states elect the Secretary of State (an administrative office) and 43/50 states elect the attorney general, so, you'd have to compare.  With the Attorney General position, it looks like states as varied as California, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Utah, etc. elect their AG, so there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern of success or failure based on that alone.",digbyforever,2023-03-13T03:55:56,2
"In general, political science has largely concluded that pluralism at the top of a decision-making structure is inefficient and not tremendously effective. While it does sometimes rein in the impulsivity of human nature, it does not always do so, and it very much does consistently hamper effective decision making. Political science has largely concluded that multiple co-equal executive decision makers is an antiquated and flawed solution to the problem of government accountability and human nature.  Rather, political science has found that a much better way to address this problem is to have strong political structures that encourage majoritarianism. By forcing a political system to largely act consistently with the will of the people, the ability for a politician to ""go rogue"" and do whatever he wants is greatly constrained. Pair that with strong representative measures to allow a system not to enact the will of the people when the will of the people is fing stupid, and you've got a well-functioning political system.",mormagils,2023-03-13T09:25:39,2
"No. Each one gets to claim a mandate and they often have differing ideas with nobody able to hold them accountable until the next election. With a single executive, all the blame rests with the one at the top; so, they make sure the others in the executive branch do a good job or get sacked.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-03-15T21:06:36,1
"I'd say that, generally, the more minds involved in the approval of the use of force against individuals - the better.  A process of 'dilution', if you will.  But, any such arrangement is only acceptable in that it embraces, realizes and endorses *individual* rights.  Pure ""Democracy"" is just, ""Might+Makes-Right"", without this respect for the *individual*.",Tetepupukaka53,2023-03-22T18:03:02,1
"Yes, I'm asking about that.   I am curious if there are any ideas in the subject. Is it better for anti-corruption, for instance.   It seems like a interesting government structure, and I am curious why it doesn't exist outside the USA, if it has drawbacks.",miciy5,2023-03-13T04:30:46,1

"What about a system in which various roles and powers in the executive branch are divided between different individuals, rather than one in which most decisions require input from multiple people?",GoldenInfrared,2023-06-01T17:41:04,1
"Basically places outside the US don’t put nearly as much emphasis on direct election or “who” governs. Americans’ hyper focus on separation of powers, checks and balances, and popular sovereignty has created an expectation that all officials holding a position of real power should be directly elected. Even judges in many states are chosen via partisan election, which creates a host of other issues.",GoldenInfrared,2023-06-01T17:29:40,2

Sounds like you're describing monarchy with extra steps. Multiple people being involved almost always improves the process.,mormagils,2023-06-01T17:45:51,1
"I meant when implementing policy not making laws and such. We’re still talking about the executive branch.  For example, the the vast majority of states elect a separate attorney general who’s in charge of the police forces, prosecutions, and representing the state in court. Separating this position from that of the governor makes the Attorney general less incentivized to turn a blind eye to criminal actions of the governor’s subordinates and prevents the governor from using the coercive power of the state to harm political opponents, as trump tried to do numerous times during his presidency.  Of course, there’s no guarantee that the AG won’t use said powers for their own gain, but at bare minimum it separates the civil and criminal enforcement powers of the state from the day to day administration of government programs, promoting accountability.",GoldenInfrared,2023-06-01T17:56:10,1
I'm confused. Don't we already do this? I'm not really clear what you're proposing that's different.,mormagils,2023-06-01T18:02:59,1
"Electing multiple officials like an Attorney General, Treasurer/Auditor, etc each with distinct functions separate but related to those of the president similar to state governments.  Obviously I’m aware of cases in which cohabition can create chaos in systems in which multiple officials exercise authority over a single topic (like semi presidential systems), but if each performs a distinct, separate function to limit the ability of a single president to use their powers of appointment, dispersal of funding*, or coercive state powers to undermine the other branches of government and establish a de facto dictatorship  *Yes congress has the power of the purse, but someone takes the money in the treasury on their orders and that person is appointed by the executive branch. See where I’m going with this?",GoldenInfrared,2023-06-01T18:09:35,1
"I honestly don't. We do have those officials, and they are each in charge of their departments and not any other departments. It sounds like we already do this.",mormagils,2023-06-02T08:52:30,1
