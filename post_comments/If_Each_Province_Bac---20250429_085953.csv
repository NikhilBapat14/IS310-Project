Please stop saying if Canada would become a state. Stop normalizing it. It’ll never happen. Fix your own country first.,tappatoot,2025-04-29T09:16:29,60
"This, even as a hypothetical of the liberal influence in the country, shouldn't be normalized like it has any merit. It's giving efficacy to a threat that we shouldn't humor.",MikaylaNicole1,2025-04-29T09:59:43,1

"Please don't normalize this shit by saying ""if Canada would become a state."" None of us want to be likened to Trump or MAGA.  If you truly care about our foreign allies and still believe them to be our allies, respect their sovereignty.",Doctor_Disaster,2025-04-29T10:05:47,1

"As an American, I personally value sovereignty. I will never entertain the idea of forcing a sovereign people into the American sphere, to voice these hypotheticals in today’s environment is normalizing the idea, which is dangerous and plays into Trump’s plan.",Born_Argument_5074,2025-04-29T10:56:32,1

Agree. You now have libs here saying “this may be a good thing”… fucking pathetic psyop from the right to infiltrate our thought process. Fuck the OP.,RTrover,2025-04-29T09:57:22,1
"As an American, telling people that an overall shitty idea is also shitty for them is not the same as normalizing it. Telling a hurka dur conservative who thinks that Canadians want to be part of the US that even if those Canadians want to be part of the US, this is how they vote makes \*them\* reframe the idea as a nonsense joke because they know that their God emperor would never do anything to add liberal voters to the voting pool.",noodletropin,2025-04-29T10:33:42,1
"> What is the deal with Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta? Why so conservative in these provinces?  Rural, agrarian region. The US equivalent would be Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota.",wenchette,2025-04-29T10:37:45,1
