…is that even *possible*?,Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-05T19:43:06,285
"Practicalities aside, would a successful outcome for Trump here mean shooting a movie on site in Rome or Paris or wherever double the budget of the movie?  Also, since he says produced, I assume that's any stage of production?  Like contracting a foreign effects company, boom 100% tariff?",Pertinacious,2025-05-05T21:06:23,213

"Honestly the movie industry has been suffering and is barely starting to come back from COVID. Even now with the ethics of having AI do the animation or voice lines and even accusations of it writing the script to some movies like Wish.  Giving restraints to it now, like Tarrifs, restrict the common practice of outsourcing some of the work to foreign studios. Would only jeopardize it even more. Hollywood ain't even on his side and has only gotten worse and worse these past few years which is part of the reason as to why foreign studios are starting to get more powerful in the market.  I agreed with Tarrifs when it came to matching other countries Tarrifs that they put on us and business taking advantage of the lack of laws and OSHA in other countries to make things cheaper, but when it comes to the creative field that the movie industry should be, it shouldn't be hindered by them.",De-Throned,2025-05-05T22:36:57,59
"I thought he just meant foreign production companies. That makes sense. I never thought filming had anything to do with it. Block busters and even indie movies are filmed according to script. They film in multiple locations throughout the U.S. and the world depending on the landscape of the movie. The states are the ones that can give issues to the studios. My state of Washington has very little filming, yet they use it in movies and TV shows all the time. It’s too expensive to film here.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-05T22:06:47,11
"States just need to start offering better incentives for studios to film here again. Georgia was booming for years with their tax incentives, but still hasn’t fully recovered after Covid, and other countries are offering better tax breaks to studios. I’m industry “adjacent” so I’m all for bringing filming back to the states, but I think this largely falls on states offering better tax breaks as opposed to somehow tariffing production overseas. Just not really sure how that would even work. But I do like that Trump is supporting bringing filming back here.",likeabuddha,2025-05-06T06:46:35,8

"Lets look at this objectively, If you film in some places they give you incentives, all this is doing is leveling the playing field.",sub2pewdiepieONyt,2025-05-06T04:01:52,-21
Think of it this way - Foreign nations are trying to move the film industry from Hollywood to overseas locations by offering incentives. Tariffs protect the US movie industry and US jobs.,wanttostaygottogo,2025-05-06T07:15:48,-12
"I'm gonna be real, it shouldn't. The president doesn't have racing authority, and this sure as shit is not a national emergency. Fuck, the tariffs he's trying to do against other nations are a stretch, but at least you can reasonably be like ""well we need to reshore American manufacturing capacity in case of a war with China, Yada Yada, yada"". A stretch, but, fuck it you can at least argue it.  How the fuck is this an emergency? Further to that point, how the fuck do you even collect taxes on this?",akbuilderthrowaway,2025-05-05T20:58:13,441

He literally ran on this and won.,Clint_East_Of_Eden,2025-05-06T01:25:37,112
Perhaps it’s the only real tool he has given that Congress isn’t doing their job. Congress should have long ago made sure we were getting fair deals in trade.,napsar,2025-05-06T04:57:53,-4
"They have never ever just strictly made movies in Los Angeles. It only offers a certain amount of outside shots, because of its landscapes. They still do a fair amount of work inside the studios. Warner Brother stays pretty busy. You can’t do everything inside a studio.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-05T22:13:20,45

"Oh, is THAT what that's about. I was thinking it meant like Bollywood or old black&white Japanese films... ""how big a market is this really?""   (Haven't paid much attention to the movie industry since 00s, did soundtrack stuff for a moment.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T19:58:57,-21
The industry struggles are of their own making. They produce mostly shit nobody wants to watch a live action Snow White.,obalovatyk,2025-05-06T02:45:04,50
It shouldn’t be up to the government to level it.,jambaintoyou,2025-05-06T04:19:34,34
Hollywood spreads Chinese propaganda. Maybe they should start there. ,GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-05-06T09:58:24,-32
I very much doubt most of the people voting for Trump voted for tariffs on movies and most of the world. I think most of us thought it just China and Mexico.,akbuilderthrowaway,2025-05-06T06:29:51,48

How many treaties were ratified bycongress instead of the executive? Can't he cancel all of the executive ones?,kaytin911,2025-05-06T05:49:16,4
"Why not? With that logic, the government shouldn’t give grants or incentives for our farmers to grow in the U.S.",jayden9271,2025-05-06T18:29:27,5
"Nice try at a straw man argument. Those are two different things, let’s focus on the topic here.",jambaintoyou,2025-05-08T16:21:57,0
And yet the overseas grants and incentives is why the movies are being made elsewhere...,sub2pewdiepieONyt,2025-05-08T16:35:41,1
So the answer is for big government to step in and control it? Why not let the free market decide what to do?,jambaintoyou,2025-05-09T15:24:08,0
I mean it's not the free market in the first place if other governments give tax and financial incentives to produce films in their countries,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-10T19:01:51,1
