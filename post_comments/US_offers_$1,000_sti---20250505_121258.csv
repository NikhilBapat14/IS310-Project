"Wait, so can I claim to be Mexican, have no papers, get $1000, bring my US passport and then come back over with my passport?",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-05T12:20:10,7
This would be a good time to check back with the federal employees who were offered buyouts to quit their jobs and see if any of them got their money.,_grandfather_trout_,2025-05-05T12:27:34,4
the real question is how will they get paid since it's very hard to get bank accounts as an undocumented (ime),sluggysmalls,2025-05-05T12:19:59,3

"They can pay me $1000 and travel assistance to move to somewhere. I'm not illegal, but I'm a person of color. Hey, these racists might totally go for it. In fact, they might eventually come up with it themselves. Actually, knowing them, they'd come up with the idea to pay all leftists to move eventually, too. Guys, let's propose this and gtfo.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-05-05T12:38:02,2

"Who will compensate all the landlords for lost rent when 11 million (or more) illegals all decide to split town in the middle of the night to cash in on this offer?  This is essentially a free get-out-of-your-lease, do not pay past/current rent,  do not pay for repairs (if needed), just leave and get a thousand bucks.   Meanwhile landlords all across this country will be screwed. I know this because  it just happened to me.   That's just one of many downsides to Trump's proposal.",BrokenGlare2024,2025-05-05T12:58:12,1
1) They don't intent to pay                       2) The offer shows that they are desperate for deportation numbers to go up,DragonPup,2025-05-05T13:04:55,1

"That's the thing, they won't get paid. No one's mailing 1000s of cheques to foreign countries. It's just in hopes that people leave, and it's names for a list.",lopix,2025-05-05T17:03:00,2

"""Won't someone think of the landlords?"" definitely wasn't on my r/politics BINGO card for today.  Maybe you can lower your rent and rent to some of 771k people in the US who currently don't have housing?",Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-05T15:48:12,1
