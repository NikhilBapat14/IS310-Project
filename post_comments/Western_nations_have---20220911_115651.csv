"""Sanctions"" is a relatively modern word. Nowadays it tends to mean something pretty specific as marketplaces and corporations have globalized and standardized. There's no real difference in a corporation created in Japan or Russia or America or Spain or wherever. Because sanctions are such a modern word with a relatively specific meaning, you're not really going to look back in history and see sanctions across human development.   But if you adjust your question a little bit to understand that sanctions are merely the modern example of governments using economic opportunity as a tool with which to act towards other governments, then it become apparent that countries/governments have always used economic opportunity as a tool.",mormagils,2022-09-11T15:07:51,9
"The Arab League organised a comprehensive sanctioning of Israel in 1945. For example, you cannot travel to Israel and then on to most of these countries if your passport is marked as having done so.  More recently, Brasil has participated (partially) in the sanctions regime against Venezuela; India has traded various economic sanctions with Pakistan.  The sanctions on Russia have historical precedent in the British and French attempts to bar trade with Nazi Germany (which were unsuccessful due to the Soviet Union supplying it with raw materiel in massive quantities), and the US attempting to stop the Japanese invasion of China by way of an oil embargo. What is somewhat novel about the current situation with Russia is that Russia is a war-making state operating under a nuclear shield, which means its enemies cannot respond conventionally like what happened in the Second World War.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-09-12T12:43:27,2
"Sanctioning can also create extremism in the population as their government can lie and create hate in the hearts and minds of their people.  When you think of an individual level of sanctioning - creating outcasts of QANON people can make terrorists, but putting resources towards those people to solve their problems and show them a different can make a population stronger and more cohesive/ better connectes. Politics focused on personal fame, fortune, and power works through creating division.",firsmode,2022-09-12T10:13:39,1
Could sanctions also be seen in a medieval sense of blocking a city so nothing comes in and out until the population starves and dies?,firsmode,2022-09-12T10:14:16,1
"You’re not really answering my question though. The act of sanctioning an individual, company or nation is refusing to engage in trade or diplomatic relations.  The US has been the dominant powerhouae throughout the 1900’s up until now, where the BRICS bloc has been formed. This is due to international trade being centered around the dollar and due to past colonization having made English the lingua franca of global trade.  The US mainly, along with its’ Western allies, realized this power with the act of sanctioning - a country refusing to follow the line, such as refusing to sell oil such as Iran, was hit, isolated and starved of trade thus hindering progress. Due to globalization this tactic is failing as the world is simply to interconnected - if someone refuses to buy goods or wares someone else is just going to take the offer.  We have never seen other countries leveraging their economic position as a weapon as far as I know and that’s my question is centered around. Have any other nation used sanctions as political tool to achieve their goals?",[deleted],2022-09-11T16:16:59,-2

"Non-western countries have definitely done this.  North Korea was famously sanctioned globally by even non-western nations after the Rangoon bombing and blowing up Korean airliners as well as Apartheid South Africa.  Many middle eastern countries have harsh sanctions and boycotts on Israel, though those have slowly started to weaken in the last few years.  China has not only sanctioned countries, but has routinely used it as a threat to countries that go against their one-China policy.",Naliamegod,2022-09-12T00:24:46,4
"China sanctioned Lithuania last year, and Australia around 2020. The use of trade or finance as a tool in foreign policy is very old. Also, the BRICS do not change anything. It is just China and possibly in the future India.",EsoitOloololo,2022-09-11T23:07:31,3
"Before the modern era, this was an embargo or blockade.   Since no one really gave a damn whether you wanted trade to stop or not, you had to put a fleet in place and make sure trade with the targeted country did not happen.   Examples might include the Northern blockade of Southern ports in the Civil War, or possibly the British actions against slave trading (essentially putting an embargo on slave imports)",[deleted],2022-09-11T23:29:08,3
"I think I did answer your question by saying that yes, countries have always used economic matters as a piece of foreign policy whenever they had the ability to do so. The modern globalized economy is mostly a very recent concept, only forming after WW2. Long before that, we've seen similar situations.  I mean, we could say that colonization was a form of economic sanctions, really. It was a given country carving out a portion of the world for resource extraction only from their country and the people that country wanted to trade with. The US has been establishing business interests in foreign countries long before globalization, and often the US government took action against political forces that threatened those interests, such as we saw in Cuba or Latin America. Japan was deliberately insular for a long time, refusing to trade with the rest of the world, which I guess is a form of self-imposed sanctions. Or there's the time the major western powers sought to divide China into pieces. Going even further back, the Ottoman Empire strictly regulated some of its goods that were foreign to the West, ensuring a limited market to boost prices. Heck, even further back than that you could call the establishment of the Silk Road being the only source of silk a form of sanctions against the West.  That looks different than modern sanctions, sure, but that's largely because corporations weren't invented yet.  I'm not sure why you're being so contentious. It seems like you're trying to imply that only the West applies sanctions. That's just not true. For the most part, because the West has been wealthier and more unified in military and political alliances, they have tended to apply sanctions more readily, but when given the opportunity, other powers do so as well.  As others have pointed out, Russia has tried to wield that club just as much. Russia's energy resources are a huge bargaining chip they use with Europe, and at various times have refused to sell energy to Europe as a political tool. Even before that, the Cold War saw an establishment of the Iron Curtain, where anyone behind the Iron Curtain was locked out of any economic intermingling with the West. That's a pretty clear example of sanctions.   The West isn't particularly menacing here. They've just had more opportunity than most.",mormagils,2022-09-12T09:14:28,1
"Letø's break it down:   \-US sanctions on Afghanistan.   \-US and allies sanctions on China.   \-US embargo, let's call it a sanction for the sake of easiness, on Cuba.   \-US and allies on Russia 2014.   \-Australia on Indonesia.   \-EU on Myanmar.   \-UK on Nicaragua.   \-US and EU on North Korea.   \-US and EU on Iran.   \-US and EU on Syria.   \-US and EU on Yugoslavia.   \-US and EU on Libya.   \-US on Venezzuela.   \-US and EU on Russia.   These are just taken from the list on the Wiki and the most commonly known countries to have faced sanctions.  The Wikipedia article lists the Russian ""sanction"" of Ukraine due to them removing their discount on natural gas in 2004 making the nation pay as much as everyone else, which was removed in 2010.  The Georgia example might classify much better as it lists Russia as having ceased trade in 2006.  The Wikipedia page lists sporadic sanctions by nations on others within their vicinty over lesser disputes.  From solely this article the main propagators of using as a politically motivated tool are US and its' allies.",[deleted],2022-09-11T23:56:05,-4
"They really are - I am currently reading *The Economic Weapon: The Rise of Sanctions as a Tool of Modern War* by Mulder, where he lies out, in the beginning chapter, the formation of sanctions as an economic weapon by the League of Nations in the interwar period between WW1 and WW2. Specifically they were constructed by a UK blockade administrator from WW1 and a French politican.  A quote from p. 22 from Woodrow Wilson on the implementation goes ""*thoughtful men have ... thought and thought truly, that war is barbarous ... the boycott is an infinitely more terrible instrument of war.*"".  The books even mentions the realisation of the impact on civil population, the starvation resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths, but was nevertheless implemented. The Ottomans were blockaded by sea, which was estimated to have been a direct cause for 400.000-500.000 deaths.  Comparing Russia increasing its' prices is just bogus as sanctions successfully starve a nation economically having lasting impacts on the population - straight up refusal to trade and engage is *not* the same as raising prices although the latter can be viewed as a form of sanction - I fully agree with that.  Western powers are, them having laid out the way of using diplomacy as a means of warfare, the main propogators of devestating and harmful sanctions conducted since WW2.",[deleted],2022-09-12T10:47:45,1
Russia banned all imports from Georgia which was able to deal a significant blow to the Georgian economy.  This is straight from the wikipedia article. It is also a textbook example of sanctions.,boklasarmarkus,2022-09-12T06:13:46,4
"Well then you need to read more books, because the Iron Curtain is basically the exact same thing and that was up from 1945ish to 1990. That's not the West. The Ottomans were blockaded, sure, but the Ottomans had also been strictly controlling access to certain goods and industries for *centuries*. I'm glad you're reading a book that is looking at this from a specific angle, but it's important to understand that you are zooming in to a specific part of the picture and denying the existence of the rest of it.  And are you seriously suggesting that blockades and boycotts and so on are tools used exclusively by the West? That's just easily falsifiable. Hell, it also doesn't even make sense to think about this only as something the West does in conjunction. The Interwar period is probably the *earliest* you can claim the West acted collectively, and even then that was without the US. The West was directing that economic warfare against itself at least as often as it was directing it against Asia, Africa, or the New World.",mormagils,2022-09-12T11:17:24,3
"> Western powers are, them having laid out the way of using diplomacy as a means of warfare, the main propogators of devestating and harmful sanctions conducted since WW2.  Of course they are.

"Where did I deny this? Compare the track record of Russia and the US and see who sanctions most - the Western powers are the main propagators of using sanctions, a form of weaponized diplomacy. Their strategic usage was proposed by the Western powers too between WW1 and WW2.",[deleted],2022-09-12T06:27:33,0
"Yes - because the US started to sanction the Soviet union and not the other way around.  No blockades prior to the modern coined termed “sanction”, as a means of economic warfare by total isolation and diplomatic alienation, happened most definitely.  And yes exactly - the West acted collectively due to the specified politicisation of halting trade as a means of warfare being defined at the given times.  How exactly would you say the US was conducting economic warfare against itself?  We have not seen any politically isolated and alienated countries such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea or the likes due to embargos or sanctions created by other states. The coordinated isolation and alienation of the mentioned nations has been going on for decades.",[deleted],2022-09-12T13:47:04,1
"I am making no moral judgements here.  I am referring to the double standard position being put forth by the Western nations. Notice how users in here lack examples other than sporadic events of sanctions being imposed aginst somebody, where the Western nations aren't the main propagators.

"Nonsense. The Soviets were as invested in economic warfare as the Americans were. Probably more so, actually. The Soviets took great pains to make sure all of their satellites were economically insulated from the global markets. It was the US that was giving away free money to anyone with basically no strings in the Marshall Plan.  Japan was also very famously refusing to ""open"" to the world and only did so because it was following the model of the West.  \> How exactly would you say the US was conducting economic warfare against itself?  I didn't say that. Prior to the interwar period, various Western countries waged economic warfare with other Western countries. The point is that it's kind of silly to treat the West as a historical monolith when really it's only been that way since the creation of NATO.  \> We have not seen any politically isolated and alienated countries such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea or the likes due to embargos or sanctions created by other states. The coordinated isolation and alienation of the mentioned nations has been going on for decades.  Again, that's not quite true. Russia has tried to do that right now with its energy influence in Europe, and it's kind of working despite Russia not having a broader alliance to back it up. Or don't forget about OPEC. OPEC is DEFINITELY sanctions against the West.",mormagils,2022-09-12T14:29:21,2
I'm not sure what 'double standard' you're talking about. Western nations impose sanctions because *they can*. Non-Western nations generally can't impose sanctions because they wouldn't do any good.,ViskerRatio,2022-09-15T23:55:25,2

"\> ""In 1948, the United States began a campaign of economic sanctions against the Soviet Union that would last more than fifty years.""  Ok, sure, and the Soviet Union was at that time creating its own Iron Curtain that locked all capitalist countries out of any economic access. Much of the concern over Southeast Asia was related to trying to control access to resources and raw materials. Are you seriously trying to paint the Cold War as unilaterally caused by the US? You need to read more.  \> Japan refuses to opens itself - how is this sanctioning others in any way? This is the opposite of conducting economic warfare as their self-imposed isolation is a decision made by themselves.  Or, it's sanctioning the entire world at once. The US and the West wanted Japan's markets to do business in and they were refused them. That's ""economic warfare.""   \> Raising prices on goods is not a sanction. To sanction is the political decision to isolate and alienate a country by refusing trade, limiting/cutting diplomatic relations and working towards cutting out potential trade partners.  Raising prices CAN be a form of sanctions. OPEC's established mission is to try and counteract the collective economic power of the West and if most oil states didn't have oil making up a massive part of their economy, they would absolutely have the power and inclination to refuse trade to certain powers. The reason sanctions work so well in a modern service economy is because the economies are multifaceted enough that cutting out one trade partner in certain industries is often more hurtful to the target, but that wouldn't be true for an oil state. You're confusing lack of opportunity for want of desire.  \> Russia is trying to leverage its' energy influence after they are being bombarded with sanctions, getting companies pulled, being condemned etc. It is Russia who is the subject to sanctions and they're trying to respond and not the other way around.  The sanctions applied on Russia are a direct result of Russia's actual aggressive military actions, though. Russia started a war and then the folks opposed to Russia struck back. Duh. Of course when you start a war the entire world agrees is wrong, illegal, unjust, etc then there will be consequences.  \> Yet we can not seem to find a country like Cuba, North Korea or Iran, which is existing as a product of being starved of trade for decades due to targeted diplomacy.  What are you talking about? North Korea refuses to trade with anyone. That's the whole point of creating a communist dictatorship. And you really need to brush up on the history of Cuba. One of the reasons that Cuba and the US weren't so friendly and why Cuba went to communism in the first place is because the US had major business interests in Cuba from when it was a US colony and Cuba nationalized those interests, which is basically an older version of sanctions. And Iran is a member of OPEC. Literally yes, we are seeing what you are saying we are not seeing.",mormagils,2022-09-13T09:18:08,2
"Again, you're getting caught up in moral distinctions or picking sides rather than focusing on the practical realities.  Imagine we live in a small town with a single grocery store.  Whether I decided to boycott the grocery store or they decide to ban me, the interruption of trade between me and the grocery store has a massive negative impact on life (at the very least, I have to travel to the next town every time I want groceries). In contrast, that interruption of trade has no impact on the grocery store at all. I'm simply not important enough to them to matter.  That's precisely what happens with sanctions. Cuba doesn't impose sanctions on the U.S. because the U.S. simply wouldn't care while Cuba would suffer greatly. The reverse is not true.",ViskerRatio,2022-09-16T00:36:46,2
