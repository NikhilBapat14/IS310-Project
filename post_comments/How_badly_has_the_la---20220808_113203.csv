How badly is this affecting Xi Jinping's chances at re-election? It's having almost no effect at all. Xi is guaranteed to win a third term in office.,PaleontologistOk7794,2022-08-08T18:08:05,21
"It is not the reaction Pres. Xi was expecting.  Pres. Xi blinked, and then did it again.  The intention was to get the U.S. to react, and we did not.  The U.S. did not take the bait.  While Pres. Xi is all but guaranteed a job for life, he's lost standing in this because the U.S. failed to react as expected.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-08-09T00:53:48,6
“Effecting a chance at re-election” assumes that there is a genuine election to be won.,cantrecallthelastone,2022-08-08T22:58:08,9
Wait what? Do you really think there is an actual election in China,TestaOnFire,2022-08-09T07:04:32,2
"I think theres been more reaction than yours giving credit for. It isn't the case here in the west, but I'd bet a lot of money that all those military drills have wall to wall news coverage on the mainland.   It isn't really the response that matters in this case, it's the perception of a response.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-08-09T08:32:14,1
Frankly we’re not going to know until after the Party Congress in August due to how opaque the elections process and internal political dynamics are. Certainly there are factions within the CCP that think the way Taiwan is being handled is counterproductive but there’s no evidence that group of people has assembled a broad based coalition to oust Xi. The military almost certainly is quite happy with Xi’s response to the visit.,abolishpatreon,2022-08-09T05:45:46,0
How was the US expected to act?,MrOaiki,2022-08-09T12:03:20,1
"Inner Party Elections, as in could Xi lose the position of party leadership, which IS a thing he has to worry about.",Heckle_Jeckle,2022-08-09T00:29:47,10
"Yes, they do. You do realize that Xi Jingping' hasn't always been their President? Hi Jintao was the previous president. The CCP has since reelected Xi Jumping for two terms. Even if it's a fixed race,the CCP has an election every two years.",mimi7600,2022-08-09T07:19:10,2
"The PRC expected the U.S. to up the rhetoric, possibly threaten new tariffs or other trade barriers.  But we didn't.  We did nothing beyond saying it was careless or Pelosi to go.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-08-09T12:09:41,1
A fine point.,cantrecallthelastone,2022-08-09T01:01:15,6
"Yeah, the CCP decide, similary to how the Fascist Italy operated. It's a fixed race, they dont decide nothing... Why are you here asking for the election if you already know how it will turn out?",TestaOnFire,2022-08-09T07:34:38,2
"They have factions in the CCP, and the dominant faction usually tries to keep the others quiet. But change does happen, or else Hu Jintao's more liberal faction might still be dictating the nation instead of Xi's.",Kanebross1,2022-08-10T22:18:53,2
"Because the election of past leaders has never been set in stone. Despite Xi Jingping's purging, there are still differently opinionated groups with the CCP.  Election results are pushed by leading party officials with strong standing. Three previous candidates with strong backing were thrown out right before different elections.  It would be normal for Xi Jingping to lose electron because of a public opinion shift because that's what's happened before. You only find out the true result on the day of the election.",mimi7600,2022-08-09T07:55:45,1
