"I would vote for any Democrat candidate that won the Democratic primary.  The alternative is either Trump again via some shady or previously illegal scheme he and Congress or the Supreme Court have cooked up, or a Trump sycophant. And that’s assuming we still have elections.  Anyone who is being picky about which Democrat they will and won’t vote for at this point isn’t reading the room.",foulpudding,2025-05-10T05:43:31,1
"I would vote for a ham sandwich if it was running against JD Vance.  I would absolutely vote for AOC, but I would do so with trepidation, as those are some long odds.  The real question is whether she or the ham sandwich would have a better chance.  I admire her, but let's be honest:  you'd be hardpressed to name a more divisive national political figure.  JD Vance shouldn't be hard to beat.  He doesn't have Trump's charisma, some of his actual positions are creepy as hell, he's about as likeable as a potato bug, and in 4 years from now Trump's approval ratings will probably be a hair or two north of Bill Cosby's.  But if you thought that half the country despised Hilary Clinton, then oh boy....",ColossusOfChoads,2025-05-10T05:32:07,1
"I’d be thrilled to vote for her, and I think some people are selling her short. That said I’d prefer she run for senator in NY.   She’s the type of mold Dems need though. Young, exceptional communicator who knows how to get attention. People would be nervous to run AOC because she’s a firebrand and Dems have become so risk adverse because we’re terrified of Fox News. Problem is Fox is going to call ANYBODY we nominate a Marxist, communist, “radical left”, etc. Joe Biden’s problem is he was unable to push back on it because he was too safe, too traditional, and didn’t want to offend, so we had just one sided criticism without any attention the other way. AOC is a MASTER at getting attention. Dems need that.   It doesn’t have to be her - this is why we have a primary process, to find out who the country thinks is the best equipped to win, but I wouldn’t sell her short.",cpatkyanks24,2025-05-10T06:08:52,1

So I'd vote for anyone that will hold corporations accountable, and actually fix the racial/ wealth inequality in this country. Political ideology is the least important to me.

"IMHO (it's my opinion, and I'm entitled to regardless of who agrees with me or disagrees with me for whatever reasons)  I fail to see whereas she's qualified to even hold the political office she has other than she has curb appeal to the young and very small and varied fractured different groups that comprise the Democratic Party.  With President Trump rooting out illegal immigrants, the Federal Government Deep  State employees,  dismantling the Lefts taxpayers sponsored propaganda networks at NPR & PBS, The Department of Youth Left Wng Indoctrination (aka The Department of Education), pushing for Voter Identification,  shrinking or eliminating the Democrats Slush Funds? The chances of someone AOC becoming President are slim to none.  It would hard if not difficult for someone if AOC to win the White House.     Trump & Vance are NOT the Democrats main problem, nor is the Republican Party.   It's the people that voted President Trump into office.   America is currently engaged in a political ~ cultural ~ societal ""Cold Civil War""   The Lefts repeated and continued attempts to shove their opinions,  idealogy,  down the Rights throats won't take place without resistance from the Right.  It's clearly obvious and apparent that the Lefts end game objectives is to establish PERMANENT One Party rule, control and DOMINATION of Congress,  the White House, The Supreme Court and the whole of the Federal Government and America.   That's NOT going to happen anytime soon in the near foreseeable future IMHO.   If highly visible individuals such as Hillary Clinton and former VP Harris couldn't clear the high bars than someone such as AOC hadn't a chance.   I'm NOT opposed to choosing and voting for someone that's a Woman or POC.  But it's going to have to be someone that's a moderate that appeals to bot sides.    Personally, I believe General Collin Powell (Or someone of his type) is the type of President that both sides could come together for (Yes,  I know he's deceased)  He wasn't politically aligned with either side too much .

">  A lot of people think she has the potential to win in 2028 and just seeing where everyones headspace is at.   A lot of people think a lot of things. A lot of people are absolutely delusional. A lot of people still approve of the current US administration after voting it in, after all.  Come 2028, the GOP is very likely going to be in disarray, at a significant disadvantage. All that's needed for democrats is a safe, boring candidate that won't alienate low-information swing voters, can come across as likeable and charismatic to the ""average voter ,"" and isn't particularly vulnerable to the Fox News propaganda cycle.  In other words, *the exact opposite of AOC.* She's gotta be the dream candidate... *for Republicans.* There is, probably *literally*, no one that the Democratic party could run who would better energize red turnout.  Would I vote for her vs. not voting or voting for JD fucking Vance? Without even the most fleeting of doubts, yes.

"I guess. Not a huge fan, but it's likely better than any alternative thr Republicanswill bring. My core issues is that I'm not a supporter of Universal Income, MMT, homes gaurantee, open borders, and more of the farther left initiatives. I'm a believer that if we build a healthy economy and add some regulations around tuition and Healthcare costs, we can improve the lives of those struggling, without increasing taxes to cover for social programs. We were tracking well under Clinton and Obama and I dont see the reason to swing to an extreme. It's like this ... if your economy is shit so citizens suffer, you dont need to give them things for free and increase the deficit in the process. That's like a bandaid over a gunshot wound. Instead, fix the economy so everyone makes a reasonable wage that affords the necessities in life and ensure corporations can't gouged you in the process.",zonearc,2025-05-10T10:39:12,1

"I would and I think many centrist/moderate Democrats would too. The thing about nominating another centrist-aligned or centrist-posturing Democrat is that it has a very real chance of dissuading more leftist voters. There is much evidence indicating the ideological purity testing of those types of voters, including the pro-Palestinian protest vote against Kamala Harris. However, many of the centrists I've talked to seem interested in only one thing: restoring liberal democracy and getting rid of Trumpism. So I'm inclined to believe that the whole of the Democratic Party is more likely to rally around a SocDem progressive -- in unity -- than to back another moderate.",WinterOwn3515,2025-05-10T02:35:08,1

It's baffling that some people think the way to combat the current wave of reactionism is to move further to the left. Chasing the mythical leftist voting bloc is a waste of time because they're unreliable and don't move the needle in swing states.

"No. Absolutely not.  I'm what used to be called a Reagan Democrat. AOC is way too far left.  I sincerely believe decades of voting based solely on party is what got us into the mess we're in today.  I held my nose and voted for Hillary Clinton because she was less awful than Donald Trump.  I voted for Joe Biden because he was the only candidate with a reasonable chance of beating Trump and his policies were less bad.  I voted for Kamala Harris because there was no other candidate with any hope of beating Trump. I sincerely wish that ""No Labels"" had not decided to pull out of the race. I believe a ticket consisting of Joe Manchin and Liz Cheney could have pulled it off.  I'm done voting for the lesser of two evils.  The Republican Party has effectively become the Trump/MAGA party. They've sold their souls for his endorsement.  The Democratic Party has proven to be completely ineffective.  At this point, I would love to see recall elections to oust nearly every representative and Senator for reneging on their oath to protect and uphold the Constitution.  The founders were afraid of this exact development. They never intended to create a two party system and warned about it. It's a shame they didn't anticipate the complete failure of the system. Dictatorial Executive, corrupt, ineffective legislative, weak Judicial.

"I'm an independent.  Though I lean conservative, there is no way I'd vote for anyone in Trump's orbit.    That being said, the problem with AOC is she doesn't temper her policies and can't win over conservative voters.  From the Green New Deal website -   ""The Green New Deal starts with a WWII-type mobilization to address the grave threat posed by climate change, transitioning our country to 100% clean energy by 2030. Clean energy does not include natural gas, biomass, nuclear power or the oxymoron “clean coal.”  The implementation of the Green New Deal will revive the economy, turn the tide on climate change and make wars for oil obsolete. This latter result, in turn, enables a 50% cut in the military budget, since maintaining bases all over the world to safeguard fossil fuel supplies and routes of transportation could no longer be justified.""  It's a great thing to go 100% clean energy, but to do this in a few years?  No nuclear?  With current renewable technology I would bet it's not possible to meet current demands.  And cut the military by 50%.  It's bad science, bad economics and bad politics.  There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the Green New Deal other than the timeline and the science / economics to back it up.    Harris got crushed and was labeled as too radical.  She was a DA who was criticized by the further-left for being to harsh on crime.   AOC will suffer a worse fate unless she embraces a more moderate stance.",tapefoamglue,2025-05-10T09:17:33,1

"AOC, but that would be obvious from my politics.  But I would be disappointed. Any time someone comes along with the least bit of rizz, Democrats immediately start talking about the presidency. The executive branch is not the only part of the government. Newt Gingrich was able to do plenty of damage spending his career in the House; McConnell is more responsible for the current mess than anyone else and he did it from the Senate.   The Republicans obviously understand that the presidency isn't the only important office, given the chuckleheads they've been putting in the office and trying to put in the office for quite some time. I wish Democrats would learn at least that from their opponents.  AOC will chart her career and I will most likely support her unless she changes a whole lot.

The GOP has been running a hate campaign against her since she first got elected, it'll be really easy to scare independents and moderates off and she's the type of Democrat nominee that'd encourage a Bloomberg-esque third-party run against her to steal votes. She could probably play better in the Midwest maybe, but the Sun Belt swing states may become pretty out of reach with her.

The only thing that matters is marginal turnout and marginal undecideds and I’m guessing that no one in this thread represents that group.  I think, like Kamala, the positions AOC tried to stake out in 2019 were red meat for Dem voters she needed to win over but not great for appealing to those national marginal voters.

"I couldn’t disagree more with your point re: Fox will call anybody a Marxist.   Yes, they absolutely will. They did with Hillary, Biden, and Kamala.   That attack didn’t stick on Hillary because she was so obviously not a Marxist, so they instead pinned it to Bernie and just claimed Hillary giving concessions to Bernie proved she would welcome socialism in her White House.   That attack didn’t stick on Biden because he so obviously wasn’t, so they pinned it to Kamala, the senator from California who had previously run a very progressive primary campaign.   That attack did stick to Kamala, because she wasn’t able to change people’s views of her as a very progressive senator from California.   Fox’s attacks work because America does not want somebody that progressive or socialist or “Marxist” (even though none of those voters know what Marxist means). If you run somebody for whom those attacks ring true, or even worse somebody who responds to those attacks with “yeah, so what?” You will never win an election in the USA.   It’s like if your girlfriend accuses you of cheating, you don’t convince her otherwise by hanging out with female friends all the time and claiming it’s no big deal, you highlight the absurdity of the claim by doing things that are quite obviously not cheating.   “Moderate” candidates like Biden won because they were successful at pushing back against those claims and able to highlight how insane they were.

"This is the 2020 Biden strategy. The problem with it is it works for an election where it’s a referendum on the GOP, but it does NOT work as well if you are the incumbent, and 2024 proved that the right wing propoganda machine can successfully make anybody unpopular and hated with that group of voters regardless of how boring or harmless they seem. Shit Joe Biden is quite literally the single nicest human being I have ever seen in politics. Devout catholic, respectful, experienced white guy, boring as hell but still somewhat low key charismatic at times. They made him hated not only with Republicans, but DEMOCRATS turned on him, despite him being wildly successful legislatively, because nobody on the democratic side liked him all that much to begin with, partially because of the reasons you stated we should elect someone. Boring, safe, tries not to offend anybody, etc.   Secondly, I don’t think this strategy would work as well as it did in 2020 because at the time Biden represented a return to a popular Obama admin representing a Democratic Party that was SIGNIFICANTLY more popular than it is right now. If Dems as a whole still are unpopular, then the “safe, boring” candidate may struggle to produce turnout we need.   I’m not saying it has to be AOC, but somebody who can generate excitement among this base is critical. Someone who can turn public opinion around on the Democratic Party is critical. AOC is an outstanding communicator, is practical, and is an expert in getting attention which is important in today’s media age.

If you were to say ""The War"" was all about just the issue of Slavery?  You would be 💯 wrong.

">The entire Kamala platform was ""Not Trump"" and going back to the status quo. But people were not inspired by the status quo and, combined with the anti-Palestine protest, it led to a lack of turnout.  There was certainly lower turnout this past election, but not in a way that effected the electoral college vote.  [Let's look at voter turnout in each year, first](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2024:_Analysis_of_voter_turnout_in_the_2024_general_election). 66.6% in 2020 that dropped to 63.7% in 2024. Definitely lower, right?  But to figure out what that means demographically (who stayed home, where, and why?), we have to dig deeper.  If we cut out the ""safe"" staunchly red and blue states, and look at the seven 2024 *battleground* states where turnout matters, they tell a very different story.  The average turnout in the seven battleground states was 70% in 2024, compared to 70.7% in 2020. Only a fraction of a percent drop - basically flat. People didn't stay home in the moderate battleground states, even if they did in safer, polarized districts.   Arizona and North Carolina are outliers within that group, seeing a -5% and -2.5% drop in voter turnout, respectively. But Harris [lost Arizona by more than 5%](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/arizona/?r=0), and [by more than 2.5% in North Carolina](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/north-carolina/?r=0) - so even if we assume that every single voter who stayed home was Democratic-leaning (certainly not actually true), Harris still would have lost had they all come out to vote.   The math is pretty compelling. In the moderate battleground states where the votes actually mattered, the election was *not* lost by Democrats staying home - it was lost by these moderate electorates lurching to the right and actively voting for Trump.  Democrats may have stayed home over Republicans by a couple % delta elsewhere in the country, but they did so almost entirely in districts that were already decided and so it was irrelevant to the election results.",The_Law_of_Pizza,2025-05-10T06:05:54,1

Every single one of them has been during a recession.    Corporations aren't stupid.  They won't just start lowering prices because they feel bad about being such meanie price gaugers.  The only reason corporations will collectively lower prices is if that's the only way to still make sales.  And as long as Americans are flush with cash from higher wages and relatively low taxes and general economic prosperity, prices will not go down.  So unless you want to artificially increase the value of the dollar by raising taxes, raising interest rates, or somehow capping prices and wages (all of those things suck) deflation ain't happening.  The best we can hope for is prices normalizing and getting to a reasonable low level of inflation.",squeakyshoe89,2025-05-10T04:49:04,1

It's not these voters I fear losing by nominating AOC. If we for simplicity assume that a moderate Democrat does not win the leftists and a progressive does not win the moderates (both of which are quantitatively false and qualitatively true), a moderate would need over a third of heterodox voters, a progressive over two thirds. Is it more likely that AOC can pull 2/3 than, say, Shapiro? Maybe. But I don't think it's more likely than a moderate winning at least 1/3.

You’re not understanding my comment at all. I don’t believe in quotas or free handouts either. But what people are proposing is that we automatically bar any woman from running for president regardless of her merit. To keep from losing. That is discrimination. And you know damn well it is. Nobody is saying the candidate has to be a woman. They are saying don’t ban someone from being the Candidate just because they are a woman. And standing up for women doesn’t mean giving them a free handout. It means helping to prevent discrimination when it occurs and standing up for them in the moment when they experience sexism. And yes that does need to be done. Because it’s still a huge issue. Almost Half the Republican Party wants a complete reversal of womens rights and to go back to the 1800s. So don’t tell me there is no need to defend women. You don’t have to give a free handout to combat sexism.,Such_Habit6986,2025-05-10T07:59:27,1
And turning a blind eye and allowing sexism to take place isn’t going to end sexism. It’s going to result in the people wanting to take away womens rights being the only voice and getting their way. Why should I vote for the left if they don’t care what bad things happen to me ? You can combat sexism without giving free handouts to women. And you know that.,Such_Habit6986,2025-05-10T08:09:55,1

They both have an interest in presenting “reasonable centrists”, and I don’t think we should take their focus groups as being representative of the electorate at large.

"Without even factoring in credits & deductions, the current tax rate in the United States is one of the lowest in the world, especially if compared to Europe.  The problem is (or maybe difference from Europe), is that the US federal government doesn't always spend that revenue on items that would benefit all the people.  Such as universal healthcare or government-paid education (it's not really free tuition, since taxes are paying for it).  At least in Europe, since everyone is paying something, they kind of care how their government truly spends it and keeps them accountable on it, which is why they benefit from certain social programs that we are unable to attain yet.  In the United States, the tax rate for the average taxpayer is 24%, while the top tax rate is 37%. Though, most Americans, after deductions and credits, are paying way less than 24%, and for 40% of American taxpayers, most pay zero income tax.  That's not because they're low-income or poor, but because the current tax code allows so many deductions & credits...and we've become to comfortable with those.  Look, I'm not saying that billionaires don't need an increase in the tax rate, though when we talk about the rich paying their '*fair share*,' and 97% of the federal revenue from income taxes come from the billionaires (and millionaires) and MOST Americans not paying ZERO income tax, there's definitely an imbalance of what '*fair share*' means.  And this is important.  As a society, everyone should contribute (according to their means) to the functioning of their government FOR services (part of that *Great Society*) that should be PROVIDED to ALL.  The situation we're seeing didn't develop overnight, nor the past eight years. It's been something we've been putting off for decades.

You can make a strong case that sincere + progressive > evasive + moderate, but it would be despite the more left-leaning position and not because of it, I think. The question is if there are any such moderate candidates at all.   On the point of the existence of ""classic"" swing voters: I am aware that Longwell actively seeks them out - which she states - but they clearly exist in sufficient numbers to find them. More examples would probably be at least half of Haley's primary voters and a number of split ticket voters (both Trump-Democrat in 2024 and Biden-Republican in 2020). But I do agree that there are significantly fewer than 10 or 20 years ago.",Significant_Arm4246,2025-05-10T18:38:33,1
"> https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-donald-trump-won-and-kamala-harris-lost-an-early-analysis-of-the-results/  You really should read these before sending them to me.   “The fact that Biden waited so long to leave the race also worked against Harris. The president’s tardy decision deprived her of the opportunity to sharpen her arguments in a primary fight and shortened the time she had to introduce herself to the voters.”  “Harris’ tactical choices made her problems worse. First, she spurned opportunities to create a clearer political profile. Although Biden’s unpopularity burdened her campaign, she refused to separate herself from him in any way that broke through to persuadable voters.”  This is what I said as well.   >https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/27/politics/election-voters-harris-what-matters-dg  “About 4.2 million fewer Americans voted for president in the 2024 US election than did so in 2020”  Again, she left votes on the table and instead chose to try and win over Republicans who ended uk voting for Trump.   >Both show once again the issue was inflation.    Inflation and not separating herself from Biden, which your own sources say would have helped her with inflation. Looking I’m happy to have this debate with you, but if you lie, it will be pointless.   >Seriously try getting out of your own echo chamber.  Your contention about Israel is not supported by facts either.    It is. Most Democrats disapproved of the war on Gaza she supported. People like AOC lied and said she was working towards a ceasefire when we now know that was a lie.   >Anyways show your work now.    Why? You haven’t.   >Prove it was caused by Israel and or not inflation.  I didn’t say it was caused by Israel. I said failing to break with Biden on Israel was a larger symptom of her refusal to break with Biden, which was a marching order she received.

"> Public money comes from bureaucrats and politicians who control where the money is allotted. Corporations lobby bureaucrats and politicians to make sure money is allotted in ways that benefit corporations.  I just told you how the system works (in the West at least). Politicians determine how much public money is spent on research, not much else. (Even the current ideological crusade of the Trump admin only affects a tiny segment of research; the cuts to funding themselves are the most impactful.) I researched whatever the fuck I wanted, not what some bureaucrat told me to.  > You're not going to earn the trust of working class voters  I'm not a politician, that's not my job.  > Socialists tend to support regulation of business so that the people aren't taken advantage of by greedy price-gougers.

">The problem is (or maybe difference from Europe), is that the US federal government doesn't always spend that revenue on items that would benefit all the people.   People should know that the chief reason US spending is high is because of health insurance and income support for old people.  That's like, two thirds of it.  The actual GOVERNMENT, meaning the part of it that doesn't just mail out checks to medical providers and seniors, is the smallest it's been since the 1950s.

"My argument is that Trump likes being president because it means he is president, which means he is the most powerful person in the world and will be remembered for all of American history. I don’t think he likes the responsibilities of being president or even has much of a political ideology himself, he says what he thinks will get him attention and beyond a few pet issues he adopts the policy stances that his advisors tell him to adopt. He is not a political person himself, he is someone who likes power and prestige and lets other people decide his political stances for him.  So I just think it’d be nonsensical for him to *become* that person who makes decisions for a successor president when he doesn’t even care much himself. Amidst the ongoing Surgeon General nomination controversy, he literally said he didn’t even know who this person really was and only nominated her because RFK Jr. told him to. So with that addressed, I just don’t see Trump accepting a made up title to do a job that he doesn’t even want to do. That’s all. If there was a way for him to actually become president again I could maybe see him doing that, but I don’t think he has any interest in serving in a role where he is not public-facing top dog, even if he was the one making the decisions. He’s not a puppet master, he’s a showboat. Moreover, there are numerous GOP figures who seem to be Trump allies but will turn on him in a second if it meant them amassing power for themselves — i.e., Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis running for president against him. I don’t see Vance being any different, if Vance is elected he’s not letting Trump make decisions for him.",lionhearted318,2025-05-10T09:47:22,1
