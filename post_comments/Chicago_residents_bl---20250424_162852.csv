Alternative title: **Fox News Launches preemptive attack on JB Pritzker because they’re afraid he will run for President.**,DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-24T16:30:38,40
This is how you know he's a viable threat,drfsrich,2025-04-24T16:33:09,18
How shocking that Fox News thinks Pritzker couldn’t win!,throwawaylol666666,2025-04-24T16:30:40,16
"From the article - they picked quotes from 3 Republican residents who voted for Trump.  None of these are Chicago Resident voices with any serious backing.  They're Fox News contributors / talking heads because they're African American.  Heck, one of them spoke at the RNC in Milwaukee last year.    In a city of millions, yes, you could find someone that has these opinions, but they specifically chose people who've likely been paid for their appearances on Fox News in the past to get quotes.",PeePeeChucklepants,2025-04-24T16:46:45,16
No we didn't . This is fake news from faux news. ,rebelintellectual,2025-04-24T16:33:54,13
"""Chicago residents"" == Naperville.  If they actually got Chicagoans, guarantee 100% of them live in Edison Park.",agent-bagent,2025-04-24T16:34:22,8
"Nah, I don’t want him as president. He’s great as governor, he actually pulled IL out of a financial death spiral. IL needs him tbh.   If only he could sort out Chicago’s finances too…",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-24T16:38:52,5
"The Pritzkers are on Trump's enemies list.  He went into a partnership with them when he was in his 20s. But, Trump was nearing financial ruin and the Pritzkers didn't care as they wanted the money they were owed. He holds a grudge and once said when he got back on his feet they would be the first people he would go after.  Also, one of the Pritzkers are on the Harvard Board of Governors and Trump singled her out when he addressed the letter requesting them to bend the knee.  This is a billionaire feud.",Purify5,2025-04-24T16:40:18,5
"I dunno, he's got a better chance than Newsom once he's done torching any remaining goodwill",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-24T17:06:37,4
I hope he does run.,pj7140,2025-04-24T16:36:48,3
"Thanks for letting us know one of the Democrats you fear, Faux News.   They also hate him, because unlike Fanta Hitler he's an actual billionaire and in their eyes (just like the Kennedys and some of the Rockefellers)...a ""class traitor"".",HPLREH777,2025-04-24T18:39:40,3
"Hey its fox news, the channel I unfortunately witnessed on a parents TV flat out lying in the headlines! Why is this an accepted source here when it lies about literal facts?",Clownsinmypantz,2025-04-24T17:49:24,2
Foxnews: now hated by both liberals and Trump,bassplayerguy,2025-04-24T18:00:39,2
Pritzker is gold! We would be in great hands.,gloriamors3,2025-04-24T20:50:48,1
"They’re scared.  He’s a genuinely likable rich white man who hasn’t bankrupted his family’s development/hospitality business   Like Trumpers can’t dog whistle about his race or gender and Trump is way older and is in similar shape, so there goes most of their playbook.   Have fun starting a birther conspiracy theory on this one",Visual_Octopus6942,2025-04-24T17:48:48,11
Yup and if they're going after him now it means he's got a good shot at winning.,Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-24T17:47:59,5
I would never vote for a billionaire. Being one is immoral. ,Bakedads,2025-04-24T20:40:56,1
Consider how conservative media comments are so hostile toward anything to the left of them.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T17:14:52,4
Hey don’t forget Mount Greenwood.,lundah,2025-04-24T17:20:04,2
The legacy of Daley machine politics in Chicago seems to be more pervasive than Tammany Hall in NYC.,LazamairAMD,2025-04-24T16:46:35,2
Agree. Had disliked Newson who had shown I don’t cares attitudes.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-24T17:16:52,1
"Sure, let perfect be the enemy of good.",drfsrich,2025-04-24T21:24:51,1
"On top of that, Chicago can’t seem to elect a competent mayor if its existence depended on it. Johnson is making Lightfoot look like legislative genius.   He’s not just dumb in a “oh all politicians are dumb” sense. He comes across as genuinely diminished. He’s been in way over his head since Day 1 and it’s not seeming like it’ll change anytime soon.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-24T16:48:28,1
