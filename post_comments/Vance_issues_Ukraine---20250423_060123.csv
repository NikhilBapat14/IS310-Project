"So, it's gone from being something that Trump would solve on the first day of his presidency, to being too difficult to be involved in at all.  Is anyone great again yet? So much ~~winning~~ whining",La-Boheme-1896,2025-04-23T06:05:11,25
Nothing says leadership like ultimatums and no-shows. Real strong message: ‚ÄúWe care‚Ä¶ when it‚Äôs convenient.‚Äù,Euphoric-Bed7379,2025-04-23T06:03:49,14
Is there any chance the US can schedule a meet-up between Vance and Putin.,biscuitarse,2025-04-23T06:16:47,8
"I'm sure Vance likes to think of himself as Trump's ""attack dog"" with his never-ending aggression towards America's allies. We saw this when he screamed at Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, when he screamed at European leaders in Munich, when he called the Chinese people ""peasants"", when he insulted Denmark while standing on their own sovereign territory, the list goes on. Unfortunately for him, he's less of a pitbull and more of an ever-so-slightly flamboyant yapping chihuahua. Nobody takes him seriously, and he's an embarrassment to America.   As for the case in point: Vance and the American administration must know that Ukraine obviously won't be able to accept a ""peace deal"" that is nothing short of a complete surrender. It's essentially equivalent to Hitler's August 29th, 1945 [""ultimatum"" to Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_German_ultimatum_to_Poland). Then, as now, the ultimatum was never meant to be accepted but gave the fascists a convenient fig leaf to pretend that they made a last-ditch effort at peace, when all along it had been decided that Poland's (and now Ukraine's) fate had been sealed. Obviously, the talking heads on Fox will lap it up, but let's not kid ourselves. Trump has no intention of supporting Ukraine and all intentions to carve up Ukraine between himself and Russia in a revival of the [Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact), with Russia keeping the Eastern Ukrainian territories while the US gets full control over the mineral deposits and energy infrastructure of what remains of western Ukraine. If it weren't all so tragic, you'd really have to laugh about the lack of imagination of these people. We've seen this exact same thing play out before.",OnDrugsTonight,2025-04-23T07:18:54,4
"They've been in office three months, and have done an ""extraordinary"" amount of diplomacy?   It's a military conflict of ten years so far, and the only remarkable thing they've managed to do since returning to office is to insult western powers like Putin's lap dog, and invite the President of the victim country to be harassed on live TV. What a little shit",OneWholeBen,2025-04-23T07:50:25,4
