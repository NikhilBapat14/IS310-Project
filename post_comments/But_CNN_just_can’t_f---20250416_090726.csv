Then you have the rank-and-file of reddit that wholly believe that all or at least most of US terrorism is right wing.,squunkyumas,2025-04-16T09:21:27,236
you're forgetting the Tesla vandalism too.,BadDadJokes,2025-04-16T09:38:16,159
CNN is a disgrace and anyone with a functioning brain knows that. CNN and other propagandists like them helped Trump get elected. The way people consume media has changed and CNN will continue to be irrelevant or harmful to their own cause in future elections.,FkDemocRats2024,2025-04-16T09:18:06,85
Just look at the 2020 riots lol. Thousands of cops injured. Over 30 people dead. Video after video would come out every single day of liberals assaulting people on the street. Or a bunch of liberal arsonists burning down buildings and private businesses. What else do they need????,BossJackson222,2025-04-16T09:49:20,68
"The FBI spent decades refusing to count left-wing terrorism like Black Lives Matter riots as left-wing terrorism, so therefore, the majority of domestic terrorism is committed by right-wingers. Sorry chud, you just have to trust the experts.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T13:14:58,21

COVID era extremism too. Remember when we were all “anti-vaxers” for declining the un-approved vaccines even after testing positive for COVID and having natural antibodies? ,roaming_art,2025-04-16T10:04:57,36
That's because they don't believe any of those things are extreme.,puzzical,2025-04-16T09:22:20,31
"> But CNN just can’t find any examples of left-wing extremism.  That's because to them, all of the violence they cause is perfectly reasonable and normal.    Burning down Tesla dealerships?  But Musk found government waste.  9 months of riots, +20 dead and a billion in damages?  3 hour riot on January 6th.  CEO assassination?  Eat the rich.  Assassination attempts on President Trump?  Orange Man Bad.    Nothing to see here 🤷‍♂️",H3nchman_24,2025-04-16T10:06:50,13

"Leftists will think violence against anyone right of Rachel Maddow is justified, and if you don’t vote for who you’re told you are the enemy. It’s the way a jihadist behaves.   One of the more egregious examples of this that I rarely hear brought up is how they reacted to Corey Comperatore’s murder in front of his wife and kids.

Luigi isn't a left winger. He's pretty conservative. His X profile and manifesto all have multiple right wing talking points. The socialists that worship him are the exact people he hates.,theboss2461,2025-04-16T09:25:12,12

"Yep, and the more extreme acts of domestic terrorism, like what occurred recently in NM with the GOP office and Tesla dealership attacks, just posted about them arresting another left-wing extremist for that last night over at r/LiberalConsequences.

The fact that they had an explicit confession is what really surprised me. He said *exactly* what his motive was during his 911 call to police and they thought they could just sweep that under the rug and make up some story about a foreclosure. Absolutely wild.  His illness is clearly the more salient issue compared to his politics. They didn’t have to lie about it.,zip117,2025-04-16T10:13:57,7
It's all but impossible to force treatment on someone who is otherwise unwilling to go along with it.  Now the asylums and sanitariums of the early 20th century was badly in need of reform for their abusive practices.  However the deinstitutionalization movement went way too far.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-16T12:42:06,1
