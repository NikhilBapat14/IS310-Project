This all started over Harvard rejecting Barron Trump,jasonbishop73,2025-05-02T07:57:43,30
"It's important to keep in mind the dynamics of *why* Trump is doing this:  This is elites vs. 'regular America' that is the heart of populism, and the appeal of MAGA. They are viewing this as part of his 'retribution' promise he made in the campaign.   Trump wants the discussions about 'protecting the elites' to be the topic. Reframing the national discourse around the plight of Harvard is good for Republicans with their base.  62% of Americans do not have Bachelor's degrees. They are counting on the majority of Americans to scoff at any rallying to the protection of Harvard. And rightly so: Trump is inept at following through on these sort of actions--they are crudely put together and historically do not hold up well to legal scrutiny.  In short, Harvard will be just fine. It has the deepest pocketed alumni in America, it has the best legal minds, it has ample resources, and it will successfully challenge any and all of Trump's actions legally with great success.",localistand,2025-05-02T07:52:30,17

"With Trump, this makes perfect sense. He’s a man-child that puts revenge at the top of his to do list, even if they were right to do what they did. Prime POS",togocann49,2025-05-02T09:01:14,8

There is no evidence that Baron Trump was rejected from Harvard. I would like it to be true but if it's not true you are not helping. Do you have any evidence?,BoscoGravy,2025-05-02T12:46:45,0
