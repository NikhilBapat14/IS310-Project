"China is shaking in their boots because we're going to send our tip-top Bestest negotiators in the world. Leading off will be Pete Hegseth who'll scare just about anybody. Next, we'll have Pam Bondi, and then we'll hit them with Little Mario, and bringing up the rear will be Jeanine Pirro. With that crack team, the Chinese will beg to take a knee and kiss the ass.   Finally, if absolutely necessary and we need a home run hitter, Rudy Giuliani will be the man America can count on to deliver. 👍",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T04:26:47,2
"Quote: Since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on China last month, Beijing has responded in kind. On state and social media, it posted images of Mao Zedong, lambasted ""imperialists,"" and sent a message: capitulation to bullies is dangerous, and it wouldn't back down.But behind closed doors, Chinese officials have grown increasingly alarmed about tariffs' impact on the economy and the risk of isolation as China's trading partners have started negotiating deals with Washington, according to three officials familiar with Beijing's thinking.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-09T03:21:24,2

"Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://www.ft.com/content/810aa0a8-6365-4876-bbd3-ea178b7f7ae9   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  >***So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.***",tech57,2025-05-09T05:02:44,1

"> ""Both sides I think are balancing trying to look tough with not wanting to be responsible for sinking the global economy,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. >  > ""The Chinese set a high bar for these talks, but it became increasingly clear that the Trump administration wanted to talk, and they couldn't say no forever. So, they've accepted what are probably best seen as pre-negotiations in Geneva."" >  > After Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao quietly reached out to his U.S. counterpart, Howard Lutnick, but was rebuffed as not senior enough, according to one official familiar with the exchanges. >  > Trump has been pushing for direct talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But China has rejected that idea as not in keeping with its traditional approach of working out the details first before the leaders sign any deal, according to public statements by both sides. >  > Another significant factor for China was Trump's public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in February, said one of the sources, adding that any unscripted hostile interaction between the U.S. and Chinese leaders would represent an unacceptable loss of face for Xi.  >Internally, China has downgraded the talks from a higher level to merely a meeting, reflecting its view that the discussions will be mostly ***about finding out Washington's demands and red lines after weeks of contradictory messages by Trump and other senior U.S. officials***, according to a person familiar with the matter.  >One of the moves that complicated the rapprochement, according to two officials, was a letter sent by the U.S. to China in late April that outlined the steps Trump wanted Beijing to take on fentanyl.  >The letter, sent to the ministries of foreign affairs, commerce, and public security, called on Beijing to publicize the crackdown on fentanyl precursors on the front page of the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily; send a similar message through ""internal party channels"" to party members; tighten regulation of some specified chemicals; and deepen law-enforcement cooperation.  >Two officials familiar with China's reaction said it found especially the first two points ""arrogant"" because Beijing saw it as the U.S. dictating what China should do within its ruling apparatus.  >***Complicating the negotiations, Trump's Washington team has frozen out many U.S. embassy officials responsible for earlier contacts with Chinese counterparts***, two people familiar with the matter said.",tech57,2025-05-09T04:54:32,3
