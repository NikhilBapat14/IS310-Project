"**From reporter Ron Dicker:**  President Donald Trump urged Fox News host Howard Kurtz to retire and called Fox News contributor Karl Rove a “loser” despite support from the two on Sunday.  Trump’s tolerance for even mild media dissent, especially from mostly friendly Fox News, appears to be wafer-thin at this point.  Rove, appearing on host Trey Gowdy’s Fox News show, praised Trump’s border security push as a “great success.” However, he urged the president to visit border towns to publicize it. He also advised Trump to cooperate with the courts in the deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and to forge “positive” trade agreements with countries instead of provoking them with large tariffs.  “I don’t need to have Karl Rove of Fox News to tell me what to do,” Trump wrote about the former deputy chief of staff under President George W. Bush. “The guy’s a total Loser who’s been wrong about almost everything!”  Kurtz’s crime appeared to be not praising Trump enough in defending the president against comments from mainstream journalists.
