"The Republican Party has been heavily pushing mail-in/early voting this year, while in 2020 they campaigned against it, claiming it would lead to fraud and things like that. And Democrats were heavily opting for mail-in voting in 2020 because of covid, whereas now they have no special incentive to do it.   So yes, based on those two factors, you'd expect Republicans to make up a bigger share of the early vote than they did in 2020. We don't really have a good sense of how much bigger, though. There's really no point in trying to draw any conclusions from the early vote numbers, because it's still new enough, with little enough data, that it isn't going to tell us much.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-01T12:28:57,1
"interesting, I havenâ€™t seen Reps campaign for mail-in ballots in 2024. Do you have a source for this?",mrjomofosho,2024-11-01T14:04:34,1
