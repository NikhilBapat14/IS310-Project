"""Falsehood?"" Jesus fucking christ they can't write the word ""lie?"" It's shorter, and more honest. ""Falsehood"" makes it sound like they're trying to not call him a liar, while calling him a liar.",7figureipo,2025-05-02T13:35:48,6
"At some point in time we just have to stop airing interviews that are piles of lies, instead of being reactive and publishing it anyways. One or two big lies get called out and the other 30 go under the radar. Get the same lies under the radar four or five times and boom now its just accepted as true.   This is how the discourse goes off the rails because he spends his time lying and democrats spend all their time making PowerPoints about his lies. Instead of actually getting shit done",blackmobius,2025-05-02T10:06:46,5
