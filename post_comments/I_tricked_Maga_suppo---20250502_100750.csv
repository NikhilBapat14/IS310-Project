She's raised over 250k so far.   The comments next to all the donations are literal nazi shit, things like ""protecting the future of white children"" and ""putting those n-words in their place.""

"> My friends and I wonder what it would take for us to get on the grift, but I think we don‚Äôt have what it takes.¬†  Ironically Trump killed the knock-off and official MAGA merch with tariffs so you have to do a bit more prep work now. And for added irony, your knock-off will be Made in the USA.   Buy red cotton shirts. Michael‚Äôs has them for example, usually made in the USA. Around $3 each. I‚Äôm sure you can find a wholesaler and get even better pricing depending on quantity.   Stock up the XL, XXL, XXXL sizes. Don‚Äôt spend too much on S, M, and L sizes. You just need enough of the smaller sizes to make it look like you have stock in those sizes and cover for the rare sell. Those smaller sizes won‚Äôt sell well.  Now you need some screen printing knowledge and equipment. Maybe you have a maker space near you? I actually learned in middle school.   Shirt is red, so text in white. Do some blue accents. On a four screen setup you still have two screens available for fun with UV and glow in the dark ink.   UV ink is safer as your customer won‚Äôt notice your hidden message until they encounter a UV light. Glow in the dark has a little more risk but if  you hide it on the back you can conceal it with folding and always fold when you put it in the bag.   Mark up your t-shirts to the $30-50 range because the even the label says ‚ÄúMade in the USA‚Äù and setup a booth for a day and get out of town before dark.   When your customers ask why you aren‚Äôt wearing your own merch ‚ÄúMy friend, I‚Äôve learned from experience customers will buy the shirt off my back if my inventory runs low, and I wear the most common size. So I don‚Äôt wear what I‚Äôm selling. Only my wife gets to see my farmer‚Äôs tan.",Xibby,2025-05-03T00:40:47,3
