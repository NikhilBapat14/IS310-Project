"I find it kinda funny that billionaires wanted Trump to be president thinking he would help their businesses but what they got was basically degrowth and food sovereignty without the name. The things they were scared Democrats were going to do.  Trump wants people to buy less stuff for more, basically live like the great depression, eat food that is only grown in America, and burned bridges in a way trade will never come back even if a deal is made. Deglobalization is here and consumerism is unsustainable in that model just like it wasnt possible in Mercantilism. Tech is going to be the ones to hurt the most.  Talk about a self goal lmao",Chicano_Ducky,2025-05-06T23:04:23,13
"non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > The haphazard rollout of President Trump’s tariff policy threatens to put the Federal Reserve in a lose-lose scenario: Navigate a recession or manage a period of stagflation.  > How the Fed negotiates tricky communications around these trade-offs will be front and center at officials’ two-day policy meeting this week.  > Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are on track to extend their wait-and-see stance on cutting interest rates and strategize how to refine it. This calculated patience reflects officials’ determination to avoid prematurely abandoning their inflation fight.   > The problem for the Fed amounts to a goalkeeper’s dilemma: Dive right to address inflation by keeping rates where they are, or dive left to counter weaker growth by cutting rates. “We’ll make what will no doubt be a very difficult judgment,” Powell said last month.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-06T22:56:08,6

They made the mistake in deciding which lies were to be ignored and which lies would happen. They pushed for chaos.,GoodIdea321,2025-05-06T23:18:53,6
"I mean that's how the US rolled up until some point in the late '90s when globalization really took off after China was added to the WTO. You can watch movies like *Father of Bride* where the dad runs a shoe factory in the US and is well-to-do because of it. I'm sure it would be seen as parody nowadays, but it was an honest living back then.  Is that worth bringing back? Is this the right way to do it if it is? I dunno, but I think the comparisons to the Great Depression are a bit hyperbolic.",stuffitystuff,2025-05-07T00:32:36,-1

"They didn't know. Article after article I keep seeing basically ""***no one could have predict this***"". I don't know if it's true or if it's just the agreed upon excuse but it's absurd either way. It's like everyone agreed to just forget about covid and The Great Supply Chain Break of 2020. They had the choice of progress or chaos and a lot of CEOs went with chaos because they and Trump made a lot of money during covid. So did Jared's college roommate.   Trade deals with USA is not what people should be worried about now. It's every other country making trade deals with China now.   See Richard Quest's reaction to Trump advisers' tariff remarks   https://youtu.be/ajepCm-mYUE?t=79    China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > ***So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.***",tech57,2025-05-07T05:19:55,2
"I could be wrong about this, but it seems like the people who would only harm certain groups are the people who are unelectable. David Duke is still alive right? I'm sure there are a number of obvious racists out there who aren't able to win elections.  So from my point of view, the people who can 'hurt the right people,' and are electable, do not care who they hurt. And maybe because of that they can have a coalition of people who think they're talking about someone else.",GoodIdea321,2025-05-06T23:55:03,3
