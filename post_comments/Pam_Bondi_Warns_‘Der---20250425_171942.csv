"""*Number 2 was arrested because she told ice they couldn't arrest the subject until after the trial, and only if found guilty.""*  My understanding was that it wasn't his trial specifically for immigration issues, but he was there for other reasons.  If I'm wrong, then yes, that's a big escalation. Although just having a courthouse arrest is already a recently huge, stupid escalation.  Either way, I still think it would be a very weak case and still likely to get tossed-out eventually (before getting to the pardoned-by-future-president stage).  As for the 2nd judge, I agree - again I think it's a very, very weak case and the feds are basically going after everybody in a haphazard and illegal way.  I don't approve of these actions, but judges are not being arrested because they make a ruling and then the feds read it and don't like it.",oynutta,2025-04-26T06:50:15,-1
"Yes, it usually means the sentence is a question. Sometimes questions come with implied assumptions.  For example, the question ""How can they charge obstruction for finding in favor of the defendant and not the fed?"" implies that someone was charged with obstruction for finding in favor of the defendant.  Since I did not see a comment that was being replied-to or see that a judge was arrested for that, I thought perhaps there was a misunderstanding by the questioner of what exactly the judges were being arrested for. I hope that clears it up.",oynutta,2025-04-26T06:18:20,1

"Be prepared and well armed and you won't have to run, because it's you who doesn't understand how this fascism thing works. My family has served this country since the ACW.  We will not go quietly, nor will our friends, but it most likely won't come to that because this isn't 1930's Germany no matter how much they want it to be.
