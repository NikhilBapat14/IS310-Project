"Party politics - I’m from the UK and I see that the two main parties are actually made up of smaller factions and groups with different interests. There’s also whips that make sure everyone conforms to the party policy when it comes to voting. Voters often don’t know much about their legislator and will (perhaps rightly) vote for the party. The party takes power away from individual legislators.  True democracy- I guess there is no true democracy but I mean getting a better democracy where power is less concentrated.  Seats - yes exactly  Those examples are interesting and hopefully have helped me better explain. I meant an arrangement where parties are limited such that a single party cannot achieve a majority. And other variations where maybe no two parties can achieve a majority. This would require a coalition between parties to form a government. I also think it would lead to parties lasting for a much more limited time, one or two election cycles, rather than hundreds of years.",Anasynth,2022-10-01T18:14:11,1
