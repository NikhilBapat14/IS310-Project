"Historically, every accusation turns out to be a confession.  Goebbels would be proud, it's his classic move of ""Publicly accuse the Other of the things you do in secret.""  Rationale being they could blame everything on the Other, while stoking those fears themselves, and thus enacting their goals, and making their men wealthy from the ""spoils"" of ""The Zionist Conspiracy"" they derided in speeches and promised to make stop.  Like the false flag Reichstag Fire, where supposedly a communist burned down the Reichstag, the home of the parliament in Berlin.   The Nazi party almost immediately ""found"" the ""Arsonist"", and used it to claim a Communist plot to overthrow the government and replace it with Communism, which was THE #1 enemy of the National Socialist Workers Party, ultimately as justification to get this decreed: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag\_Fire\_Decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree)  A full suspension of civil liberties, portions of the Weimar/German Constitution, habeus corpus and more.  It was the final step the Nazi party needed to completely do away with those pesky laws and rights that got in the way of their goals.  Basically ""anything and everything is justified to eliminate this communist threat"" when the whole rationale behind it was little more than a conspiracy theory the party made ""real"". All the excuse they needed to slaughter anyone they could possibly label a communist. And the Party took full advantage of it.  Their patrols, little more than squads of thugs, Party goons, could pick you off the street and gun you down with automatic weapons. You were obviously a communist. All you can do is beg for your life while these young men, scarcely more than boys, laughed as they pulled their triggers.   If you ran a store, and these thugs came, even if you give them everything they asked for, they could haul you out back, and shoot you dead, just because.  This act enabled every Nazi to personally act out their own hatred, just like the party promised them. It created loyalty and a sense of unity, to be massacring civilians... Others outside the party ""turned in"" their rivals and enemies, their neighbors, sometimes their own family for being a communist.  Thousands were executed as ""communists"". It was the first mass purge of Germany, now under The Party's control, and every single person in the country knew who was in charge now.  But they sat by, like we do today, and assumed they were not on the list of those the Party would rather purge than let live.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-02T13:54:24,19

"Theoretically the House Parliamentarian  should stop a vote like that, and likewise the Segeant at Arms should refuse an unconstitutional order.  If they comply (or they're replaced with individuals who comply), it's yet another constitutional crisis.  I don't think SCOTUS would have jurisdiction to review (not to even get at the enforcement question), but obviously it would be unprecedented. SCOTUS can review *acts* of Congress under Marbury v. Madison, but can they rule that a procedural decision is unconstitutional? I have no idea.

Nothing Trump has done so far is even close to something like him personally somehow expelling a member of Congress. There's no mechanism for him to do so.   It isn't ""quaint"". It is reality. The idea that Trump is some kind of unstoppable autocrat is just giving up before the fight has hardly begun.

"At this point, the only way to save this country is to hope and pray we make it to the midterms without massive civil unrest and that we elect a super majority in both houses. If that happens, the best possible outcome would be to support any effort to undo any gerrymandering that risks GOP politicians being voted in the House, expand the House to match population size, expand the SCOTUS, and figure out a federal law that encourages voting to the point that states have to accept votes from ALL their citizens. No more limiting or denying mail-in. No more limiting hours or polling locations. No more arbitrary restrictions on voter registration.   Priority #1 would have to be expanding voting. Then expand the House. Then expand SCOTUS. Bonus would be eliminating the electoral college or at least expanding it to match population (like the House).   Priority #2 would have to be properly funding the IRS and passing tax laws that levy heavy fines on anyone worth more than $1billion. No one should be able to acquire more than, like, $500mil, but let’s just say a fair $1bil.  I truly believe if we did this, the GOP would never be in power again. The Dems would become the right wing party and an actual progressive would be allowed to break off from the Dems.  I legitimately cannot see a path forward for our country any other way. If we can’t squash the GOP, we’re cooked. Done. The “American prosperity” way of life will never return. We will fall to “developing nation” levels of poverty and wealth disparity and from there, who knows how hard it will be to climb back out.",blissfully_happy,2025-05-03T01:57:49,2
