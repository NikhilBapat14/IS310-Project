"At an engineering firm, which the head of Space-X and Tesla should understand, no one would accept a hand-wavy assurance of “I fixed the problem.” They’d want to see the code diff, the changes to schematics and BOMs. They’d want to see the data from the before-case and after-case and how you identified that the changed component was the root cause of the issue.

"Steve Bannon, US President Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, on Wednesday said that before Elon Musk pulls back from his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, he needs to make clear what fraud and waste in the federal government has been uncovered.  “We need to have a very specific accounting of what he found, as far as fraud goes and waste, and I mean details,” said Bannon. “None of this makes sense.”  Bannon also said he wants a letter of certification showing that no one has taken any data from the Trump administration or government, to which Semafor’s editor-in-chief Ben Smith asked, “Sounds like you don’t trust [Musk] not to take data?”  While Bannon has supported DOGE’s efforts, he has called Musk “evil,” in an escalating clash with the tech billionaire. Bannon said Wednesday that DOGE was “a blunt-force instrument” that was needed to gut government waste, but that the cuts made to the federal government so far are only “programmatic,” noting that DOGE hasn’t turned up much from the Pentagon.
