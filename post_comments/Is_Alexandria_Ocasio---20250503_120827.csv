If a 34x convicted felon can get elected then *anyone* is electable.,BukkitCrab,2025-05-03T12:11:43,63
"I mean she has literally won her seat against an entrenched and empowered Democratic incumbent so, like, demonstrably.   I'm assuming this shitty journalist meant ""can she win POTUS"", and the answer is yes, she absolutely could.  The entire question of ""electability"" is really stupid. We handle this debate extraordinarily poorly. And when or if a candidate loses, we automatically assume the problem is entirely inherent in the incumbent.   The 'electability' question comes from the Democratic obsession with winning elections by taking Republican voters.   No matter how often they lose doing this, they never stop.   If you asked someone in 2004 whether a black man with the middle name 'hussein' could ever be president, they'd have said no fucking way.   Four years later, we have one of the most powerful and popular Democratic adminstrations in modern party history.  I am sick to death of the take that a woman ""can't win"" merely because two in recent memory did not win. This is a woefully inaccurate read on the situation.   Clinton *won* by millions of votes, and people havet o remember Clinton was a uniquely dislikable candidate. Many in the party didn't truly want her. The party considered it to be ""her time"" and put all the weight on the scale they could to push her into the nominee.   And despite all of that, she won the popular vote by millions.   Kamala Harris' campaign only had *100 days* from when Biden stepped down. Trump had been campaigning for *years* before that. He had essentially never stopped. And Russia and China put their thumbs on the scale to catalyze a large part of the base against her on the issue of Palestine.   So the take that ""a woman can't win"" is fundamentally untrue. Both women candidates that have been run recently have had unique obstacles that are not related to their gender, and both still performed extremely well *despite* those obstacles.  AOC is an extremely popular candidate. She has an approach to new media that is unrivaled in the party, and it gives her a reach that almost no other candidate has.   She did a live stream after the election asking to hear from voters in her district who voted for her *and* Trump. And the vast majority of those voters told her that ""I voted for you and Trump because you both seem like real people"".   Nearly every fucking voter in this country is sick to death of the consultant-manicured nothing candidate. That's how Trump dominated the primaries to begin with.   Any Democrat underestimating AOCs ability to appeal to fundamental, core issues that voters across every spectrum in America have with our political apparatus are insane, and repeating the same mistake over and over and over again.  **EDIT**:   Someone commented to me that:   > AOC is a polarizing candidate. She'll never draw enough centrists to win.  To which I will point to the fact that Donald fucking Trump won. Twice.   And all the pundits who don't know shit and the strategists who don't know shit said, every time, in advance of every election, that Trump couldn't possibly win because he was too polarizing for the delicate ""centrists"".  And they were always wrong because they *are* always wrong. They are fools. They are fools who never suffer repercussions for being wrong, and so they keep being fucking wrong.  Let me give you all a little tip. The metric asston of consultants and pundits in DC are not there to actually determine *who America wants to vote for*. They're there to help the party identify candidates who can be controlled, so that the donors and billionaires and foreign state agencies who pay for this infrastructure can keep government shitty.  If you keep up the neoliberal bullshit that causes Democrats to lose so fucking often, then they will keep losing so fucking often.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-03T12:14:07,34

I like her, but she doesn’t have the political experience to make any real change, even if by some miracle she were to get elected.

"I hope she is too smart to run for president in the next cycle. She is young and has done well elevating herself in her current position, but going straight from the House to the White House has only happened once.  Were I her, I'd focus on a senate seat. Schumer is getting up there and he has an approval rating lower than W at the end of his second term. She can beat him in a primary should he not step away and I can't think of any republican who could beat her statewide in New York.   A senate seat would give her an even bigger platform. Should a dem win in 28, she can bide her time for 8 years, building her name even bigger in the senate and then run in 36, two years into her second term as senator so even if she doesn't make it through the primary, she's still got her senate seat and has a seat at the table. God forbid, a republican wins in 28, she'll still be safe for a run in 32 with two more years until her senate seat is up for reelection.   If she runs for president in 28 and loses, she won't have her house seat anymore. She has the media savvy to stick around in the convo, but that's a much weaker position.",travio,2025-05-03T12:28:06,4
"I think after 2025 and potentially the next 4 years of damage if Trump et al is not impeached, removed, and convicted, there will be a wake-up call for many Americans showing the importance of government. From regulation of water, air, environment, to vital services relying on gov’t funding, and healthcare systems that become increasingly broken, perhaps another pandemic, we’ll realize the need for government in helping to make a large nation of 300+ million people a better place.

The rise of figures like Andrew Tate and the growth of online spaces like incel communities and the broader ""manosphere"" reflect a troubling trend of increased misogyny.

"Both of these responses are too simplistic.  It's true that within the context of the United States' political spectrum, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez undeniably occupies the far-left quadrant.   However, that's only because the US political landscape has experienced a significant rightward shift over the past few decades compared to international peers.  This shift has effectively pulled the Overton Window much further to the right, making positions that would be considered mainstream in many other developed nations appear radical within the American context.  And when you broaden your perspective to a global scale, Ocasio-Cortez's policy stances align more closely with the center-left. Nothing she suggests is particularly resolutionary or controversial. Her advocacy for social democratic policies, such as universal healthcare, robust social safety nets, and strong climate action, are all very commonplace in many European countries, where left leaning social democratic parties typically play a dominant role in government, leaving far left and right parties on the fringe.   Just to start- and probably the biggest departure that sets her apart from the left is her stance on nationalisation. It's very weak and mirrors that of center left new-labour in the UK where she generally flavours public regulation over ownership.   Her focus on international co-operation and global free trade is also rather uncharacteristic of the far left who tend to be more focused on internal national politics and domestic industry.  And while she does support scaling back the US military budget somewhat in favour of education, health and social care she does not advocate for demilitarisation or nuclear disarmament as many far left ideologues do.  And while she advocates for a robust welfare state and a fairer wealth distribution but she doesn't advocate for a UBI which is a big departure from the far left again.   She also more broadly respects the social capitalist democracy we have. She respects the process and frameworks that exist and wants to work within and uphold them and even strengthen it. Many on the far left (and right as we see with Trump, MAGA etc) advocate for systemic change and would rather see a revolution and complete upturn of the democratic norms we've grown accustomed to into something much more authoritarian.",Deep_Lurker,2025-05-03T17:47:31,0

"Two highly qualified, competent women have now already run and lost. The US instead chose to elect a rapist felon dictator. Voters would rather have rampant rape and austerity over a decent, logically sound woman president.  If the democrats run another woman, republicans will win. That's because the US is too sexist to vote for a woman for president. US women right now don't have guaranteed equal rights, and they lost Constitutional rights just 3 years ago. That means the US is becoming more sexist than when Clinton ran. Which is probably why Harris didn't win the popular vote.  >One chilling experiment suggests that the simple fact of Clinton’s gender could have cost her as much as eight points in the general election.  >We don’t need science to tell us that it was more believable to almost 63 million US voters that Trump, a man who had never held a single public office, who had been sued almost 1,500 times, whose businesses had filed for bankruptcy six times and who had driven Atlantic City into decades-long depression, a race-baiting misogynist leech of a man who was credibly accused of not only of sexual violence but also of defrauding veterans and teachers out of millions of dollars via Trump University, would be a good president than it was to imagine that Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state and arguably the most qualified person to ever run, would be a better leader.  https://archive.ph/KPes2",SeductiveSunday,2025-05-03T13:35:23,-1

">One of the groups that votes against Hillary Clinton most consistently is white men. In 20 of 23 contests for which we have exit poll data, white men have preferred Sanders to Clinton...In Vermont, Sanders saw one of his most dominant demographic performances: White men in the state favored him by 83 percentage points over Clinton.  >We can look at it another way. In 2016, white men are the only gender-race combination to overwhelmingly favor Sanders over Clinton. White men back Sanders by 26.4 percentage points more than do white women (who prefer Clinton, on average). In 2008, white men voted more for Clinton than Obama — but were 20.6 points less supportive of her than white women.  https://archive.is/otx1z   And if you want to understand why this is important…  >Until 1980, during any Presidential election for which reliable data exist and in which there had been a gender gap, the gap had run one way: more women than men voted for the Republican candidate. That changed when Reagan became the G.O.P. nominee; more women than men supported Carter, by eight percentage points. Since then, the gender gap has never favored a G.O.P. Presidential candidate.  >In the Reagan era, Republican strategists believed that, in trading women for men, they’d got the better end of the deal.

"So you are saying that historical reality is ""really, really stupid superstition"".  AND THEN, you are also claiming it has only happened twice and it was a result of poor strategy and not that they were women.  When in historical reality women have run 11 times under two different parties (completely different strategies) and ALL lost.  What you also fail to grasp is, losing is the only important factor in an election.  Not only did Harris lose EVERY SINGLE SWING STATE, she also lost the popular vote.  Prior to the 2024 election, the last time a Democratic presidential nominee lost the national popular vote was in 1988, with Michael Dukakis.  She didn't just lose, she got destroyed.  The reason that Harris only had less than 100 days to campaign was because Biden's campaign manager, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, was hiding Biden's senility.  Jen is not a man either.  You are making completely delusional conclusions to an absolutely obvious fact.  EDIT:  BTW I voted for Harris, sent out post cards and traveled across through 3 states to canvas for Harris in Uniontown, PA, the weekend before the election.
