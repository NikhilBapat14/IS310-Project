"When the truth scares you, the first step is to silence the source.  Democrats need to take the gloves off when they win the House back in 2026.",Father-of-zoomies,2025-05-02T08:19:40,12
"At this point, it's clearer to me that we're going through our own version of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) under Mao.  It's similar attacks on the educated and cultural classes, on institutions of higher education, science, the judiciary and societal progressive values, but this US version is replacing the socialist basis of China with Christian nationalism.  And I worry about the darker path that would predict.    NPR and PBS are just more predictable targets for this regime when you apply this lens.  Attacking and controlling the media is a basic step in the authoritarian playbook.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-02T08:27:14,10
