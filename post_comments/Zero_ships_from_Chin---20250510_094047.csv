reminds me of covid when Italy was shutting down and America still did not realize what was coming.  We will all of a sudden start feeling the effects of the tariffs soon.  The recession and stagflation train has also left the station.  Trump went way to far and has scared even our closest allies into looking for alternatives.

I would like to point out that their weren’t ships departing China during the pandemic because our ports had historic backlogs & there were hundreds of ships either anchored offshore or doing circuit-tracks for weeks waiting for their turn to offload.   This is different. Right now there isn’t enough trade to fill the ship enough to make it profitable.   I’ve spent 15 years in the supply chain mostly in procurement. This trade war is unbelievable.

"But in the great depression, people couldn't afford to buy anything at regular prices, and that drove trade collapse.   Today, income didn't take the first hit, trade did, so people who want to buy those things will simply have to pay more for them, and many will do so (some items will become simply unavailable, so people will go without or shift to pricier substitutes). It's a direct inflationary pressure. But once inflation kicks off even more, well now *most people* can't afford to buy anything.   They're similar events but since in this case we're self inflicting the economic pain with trade first, I don't think it's right to extrapolate that trade will continue a radical decline.

From a different angle, it’s also deeply frustrating how political and polarizing some topics have became, and how out of proportion they are talked about compared to the weight of them as actual platforms.

In doing so he also kneecapped the unions in future negotiations. The threat of a strike needs to be taken seriously, and the president and Congress stepping in on behalf of industries to preemptively break the strike is just another form of corporate welfare.
