The culture of death is never going to be satisfied.  Option for the dying has morphed to option for the suffering to suggestion for the suffering.  The next step is mandatory even if you don't want it.,NotRadTrad05,2025-05-03T17:26:08,15

Assisted suicide should always be illegal.,mexils,2025-05-04T00:49:59,2
I don't think it will ever be mandatory. But I think people will be influenced enough to believe it's their only and best choice if there's any suffering involved.,ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-05-03T21:37:59,6
"Friend, don't under-estimate the human capacity for evil. There may very well come a day when the economic burden for caring for the elderly becomes such that compulsory euthanasia at a certain age becomes the norm.....particularly in rapidly aging totalitarian societies like China.  I surely hope such concerns are never realized, but I wouldn't be at all surprised.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-04T06:55:16,8
"i can see this. Nursing homes as a whole are where people,e drop their elderly off and visit them maybe twice a year.   meanwhile the residents souls , whats left just wither and die.   We took care of my father in law at home who had dementia.   Mat alarms, cameras, someone up and watching him 24/7. brother in law and his wife would do nights. me and my wife would do days.   We had to base everything we did around the circumstances and were very limited as to what we could do on our own time. I am well aware of how hard it is.  i would do it everytime over putting someone who i loved into a nursing home.  This person thinks euthanasia for elderly wont be a thing.  Factor in costs, availability, compassion , greed, time (demand). People will support it from all angles.  My wife also worked corporate hr   over 100+ nursing homes facilities for a long time.  People wouldnâ€™t believe what goes on, on a day-to-day basis. or that it is very common for elderly to never be visited in a year by family or friends. Just abandoned.",Hulluck22,2025-05-04T07:18:08,6
Kudos for the humane way you dealt with your father in law. Most people aren't as selfless as you were.,Vessarionovich,2025-05-04T08:00:32,2
