"Trump is so full of shit no one want to do business with him. But the problem is bigger than him, it's the US reputation as a reliable partner that is gone for decades to come.

"America has to understand that the only things that make it exceptional are its Democracy and the individual rights it promotes and its protection of the free entreprise system.  It is not the people of America who are exceptional, it is its institutions. So ""American Exceptionalism"" only exists for as long as America is a democracy that cares about promoting justice and freedom throughout the world. Without those, the American people are just ordinary people.  Second, there is no ""Manifest Destiny"", God does not have a plan for the U.S. and America is not destined to rule over or to guide the world into some kind of utopia.  Third, what makes America good is not its devotion to God but its devotion to Democracy, the rule of law and human rights. Without those America is just a shithole like many other countries out there.  Lastly, if America does not get back to its senses quickly and rid itself of those who want to destroy its institutions, and that means Trump and his sycophants, the Heritage Foundation with Project 2025, the Religious Right, its billionaire oligarchs and many others, Canada might be called upon to replace America as the beacon of freedom, justice and liberty in North America.",Agressive-toothbrush,2025-05-01T10:04:55,22

"America's institutions frankly aren't particularly exceptional either, at least not in modern day.

"Free enterprise isn’t compatible with democracy or individual rights and freedoms; it undermines them.   This contradiction places the United States in a precarious situation and the question remains:   “If the United States supports free enterprise and has granted monied interests (see citizens united) the freedom and rights to dominate US citizens and effectively subjugate them with low wages and tying healthcare to employment; do we have a democracy?”  I’d say the answer is that we don’t. It’s a managed democracy where the desires of the wealthy elite matter and everyone else is effectively a second class citizen in their own nation.   If you don’t get with the program suddenly the government finds cause to deny you the rights granted to the wealthy elite. You aren’t able to pursue the right to “life, liberty, and happiness” when your entire existence and ability to support yourself is being reliant on a company that will pay you the bare minimum and then have your healthcare directly tied to that job that exploits you. So if the entire system as it stands requires for huge swaths of the population to remain in exploitation we don’t have anything near a democracy.",alien88,2025-05-01T12:19:04,3
