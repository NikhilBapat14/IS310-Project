"It has one purpose, and only one purpose: to convince all thirteen colonies to ratify the Constitution. That's it.  Like most ill conceived compromises, it's been a boondoggle ever since.",TheOvy,2025-04-25T21:00:09,230
"There are multiple things bad about the electoral college.  The main issues are the winner-takes-all method used by most states, and the FPTP method of determining the winner. If states switched to a proportional allocation of electors (not Maine and Nebraska's district-based allocation), it would become far better, but still not ideal in my view. It'd still heavily tilting number of electors toward small-population states.  Uncapping the House of Representatives, or at least increasing it, would also help, since that limits the influence of population which, again, gives small-population states an built-in advantage.  Another problem is that the House is elected by single-member districts with (mostly) a FPTP approach. Switch these to at-large multi-member districts based on proportional representation and I think we'd immediately see a reduction in the wild partisanship. It'd still be there, but lessened, and I think this would have an effect on the overall political narrative in the country. And this can be done purely via congress, no amendment needed.  Personally, I'd like to see the senate go as well, or at least dramatically reformed, but that's a much bigger fish to fry given it's built into the constitution.  > Why keep it, or why change it?  Because it's written into the constitution. Changing it requires an amendment, and that just doesn't seem feasible in the current political environment.",Statman12,2025-04-25T21:45:36,39

"it’s a good question because it taps into that gut-level feeling a lot of people have... that somehow the system we’re told is fair doesn’t actually feel fair in practice.  the electoral college wasn’t built to be democratic. it was built to balance power between states, especially smaller ones, and to make sure regional interests didn’t just get steamrolled by raw population centers. in theory it was about protecting minority interests at a state level. in reality, it’s always been a compromise layered over deeper compromises... like slavery, rural power, and elite control.  the problem now is that the conditions that made the electoral college ""necessary"" don’t exist the way they used to. communications aren’t slow anymore. states aren’t isolated cultural islands. cities and rural areas aren’t different planets. we’re one economic body, one information network... but still clinging to an 18th century mechanism that treats geography like destiny.  and yeah... it warps incentives. it discourages people from voting in “safe” states. it makes a handful of swing states more important than everyone else. it means millions of votes can basically vanish into the ether while a few thousand votes in ohio or florida can flip the whole country.  is it “necessary”? not really. it’s tradition dressed up as strategy.  but here’s the kicker... the real purpose it serves now is keeping the illusion of balance without fixing the underlying rot. it lets elites pretend the system is working because every once in a while “their side” wins, even if the majority of voters didn’t pick them.  you wanna fix it? you need way more than just scrapping the electoral college. you’d have to rethink the whole way we define power, representation, and legitimacy in a country too big and too diverse to be run by 18th century compromises.  but that conversation’s too big for tv soundbites... so instead they just keep patching the old machine and praying it doesn’t explode mid-cycle.",Famous-Garlic3838,2025-04-25T22:08:11,16

"I do not understand this obsession with the Electoral College. Most parliamentary systems used internationally don't base leadership on the popular vote either, and nobody seems to think that's a problem.

"It definitely benefits Republicans, right now, more than it does Democrats because more states lean more Republican than the nation as a whole. Wyoming has the same amount of electoral votes as Delaware even though Delaware has nearly twice the population (400,000 more people).  It’s a horribly outdated system that serves as a necessary part to keep the union together. Our states are already very divided between red and blue. Republicans would probably riot if it were abolished because it would very improbable that they win the Presidency again. They had 2 decades between winning the popular vote 2004-2024. And 2024’s popular vote margin was quite small.   Honestly, Democrats should work on reforming the current system. They must push for an increase in the amount of Representatives in the House past 435. This will increase the total amount of electoral college votes. In turn, this makes the number of electoral college votes more proportional to the state’s population, tying closer the popular vote to the electoral college vote.",Done327,2025-04-25T20:57:05,7

IMHO there are two options in regard the EC:  1) Apportion the EC votes based on the number of the number of seats in the house. Whoever wins a Congressional district gets the EC vote for that district. The remaining two votes go to whoever got the most votes in the state.   2) Abolish the EC and have a popular vote.,bipolarcyclops,2025-04-25T21:59:54,2

"There was a real purpose behind its inception. When they came up with the idea, it was solving a problem and giving more people the chance to vote. A candidate could not possibly reach everyone, so instead, the political party and electors in a state campaign. People vote for the people who will vote for the president, because it is easier for them to trust the local alderman than some random person hundreds of miles away.   It prevented candidates from focusing their energy on population centers to get the most votes out of a single campaign event. There would never be any point in trying to reach someone in backwoods Pennsylvania when they can just go to Philadelphia. More people could be engaged with the EC model.   That was less valuable as education and literacy improved, and as national publications became more popular. More people had access to information. Continue that further to broadcast television, and later the internet, and the entire problem the EC was meant to solve was gone.   Then the reasoning for it shifted. An accidental result of the design of the system was that rural areas- which tend to lean more religious and conservative- had more voting power because electors are not evenly proportional. Far more votes are filtered into one electoral vote in population centers than in rural areas. That gives rural, evangelical, conservatives outsized power when considered as a collective. That is not the kind of power one would want to give up, so that is who protests any change in the system.   The problem is, the population outpaced the structure of the system. Electors are tied to the number of representatives, and that is tied to population.  But there is a cap on that, so higher populations have their representation diluted. If the cap on representatives was lifted, and we had one per every 700k people, it would make Congress unwieldy. So the answer is to decouple it from Congress.   Give every state 1 electoral vote for every 700k people, and distribute them proportional to the state popular vote. That system would still allow for the original solution of promoting local party campaigning, while at the same time ensuring every American has the same voting power as every other. A minor constitutional amendment, and a state compact is all that would be needed to preserve the strength of democracy. The cost of that preservation would be removing a manufactured advantage for one party, and they would rather preserve that than preserve democracy.   It’s not the system that’s flawed. It’s us.",jadnich,2025-04-26T10:28:06,2
"**Here's some comments  I've made before about the electoral College.   There is some redundancy because this is two different posts that were focused on two different questions...... But I'd rather not forget about the wheel:**   Popular myth is often repeated today that it was implemented to give more of a balance to *low population* states.  This is not exactly the case.   Evidence exists that it was more so to give advantage to *[slave states](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/electoral-college-racist-origins/601918/)*.  While some founders were for a direct popular vote, it was seen as a non starter  because there were so few voting eligible individuals (white land owning makes) in the slave states.  But by weighing the house of representatives for that state into the equation (due to the 3/5 compromise), ""helped""  fix that disadvantage.  Even if it was intended to help low population states, the advantage would've been steadily eroded as the house grew larger and larger (until 1929 when the house was capped at 435 members).  However neither low population or slave states were the primary purpose.  They essentially intended for people to choose an elector in a district by district basis and for that elector to use independent judgement to **deflect against populism** when choosing the nation's leader.   [Source.](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp) This was their focus. Populism. Not population.    But this system as they envisioned it never came to be.   Some states appointed their electors (like South Carolina until after it rejoined the union after the civil war), and equally as problematic in their eyes was the system of pledged electors which completely defeated the purpose of the system. By 1832 every state besides South Carolina transitioned to this. [Source Pg. 7](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College#cite_note-50)  The founders hated it immediately and unlike many things where they disagreed and bickered, it was rather unanimous. Hamilton [drafted](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289) an amendment to the constitution to more specifically state how the electors were to be chosen but he was murdered by Vice President Aaron Burr before it could advance.     And decades later, Madison [called for](https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023) one too.  He states:  ""The difficulty of finding an unexceptionable process for appointing the Executive Organ of a Govt. such as that of the U.S. was deeply felt by the Convention; and as the final arrangement of it took place in the latter stage of the Session, it was not exempt from a degree of the hurrying influence produced by fatigue & impatience in all such bodies; tho’ the degree was much less than usually prevails in them.""   While Jefferson agreed with Madison, he was pessimistic about an amendment coming to be.  He stated in a [letter](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/98-01-02-3707):  ""I have no hesitation in saying that I have ever considered the constitutional mode of election, ultimately by the legislature voting by states, as the most dangerous blot in our constitution, and one which some unlucky chance will some day hit, and give us a pope and antipope. I looked therefore with anxiety to the amendmt proposed by Colo Taylor at the last session of Congress, which I thought would be a good substitute, if, on an equal division of the electors, after a 2d appeal to them, the ultimate decision between the two highest had been given by it to the legislature voting per capita. but the states are now so numerous that I despair of ever seeing another amendment of the constitution.""  That last part particularly hits home today. Not only were they second guessing their executive election processes, but were seeing how the amendment process became unwieldy as more and more states were added to the union.   We have really had three true elections where the popular vote didn't decide the election; 1888, 2000, and 2016.   1824 is often cited but the true popular vote is unknown since six states still appointed their electors.   I don't personally count 1876 because that one was decided by the Compromise Of 1877.    So I don't think there's been much call to change it until recently because generally the popular will has mostly played out, until recently.    Perhaps the National interstate Voter's Compact will happen.   Who knows?  But I think this discussion of the electoral college is necessary to refute some people who treat the founders like Gods and the constitution like a Bible.  Even the founders themself saw the holes in the system they created immediately after it was put into effect; and it became even impossible for them to fix even though they all tended to agree in their old age; unlike the heated debates that took place when they were actually drafting the constitution.  -------------  We need to switch to a popular vote with ranked choice voting (although I prefer STAR voting 3 minute video explaining it if you don't know what it is. However, RCV has the most momentum now.) That's the only way we will get third parties in the drawing.   There's really nothing more to it than that. In fact, we came closest to abolishing the Electoral College when in 1968 George Wallace tried to throw the election to the house just like I described.. He got a bunch of electoral votes in the south, but not enough to prevent a majority. But because of this happening, Republicans and Democrats proposed an amendment to abolish the system and it got pretty far before hey inevitably failed again.   The electoral college is not only an antiquated system, but it never even functioned as it was supposed to. The founders wanted it to operate as a true indirect vote. They anticipated that there would be electoral districts and within these districts people would choose electors because they were the smartest and most informed people in town. They would go to the state capital and using their independent judgment make their best choice (two choices originally) for president that represented the people of their electoral district.   They didn't think there would be these big National presidential campaigns, and thought the process would be something that was decided over a relatively short amount of time. Really, they anticipated that it would almost start with the electors gathering and voting!  You see, with so many electors acting in good faith and using independent judgment in separate state capitals, they thought it would be rare that any candidate got a majority. So they thought the Electoral College would almost be like a pseudo primary system so to speak, and that the president would be chosen by the house from the top five candidates spit out from the Electoral College process. Whether or not it was chosen by the house or electoral college, it was important to them that it was indirectly chosen by the people, well also protecting people from electing some crazy populist demagogue.   The mode to elect the President was the last thing they wrote into the Constitution at the Philadelphia convention. They were tired and out of steam, so they kept the process vague and figured the details would be hashed out in the future. But after all we're debating it back and forth intensely and just wanted the process to be over and to go home.   What they did not anticipate is that the system of pledged electors would come about. With the system of pledged electors the system of winner-take-all elections ended up coming because that's what gave each state the most power as a unit.   When Madison and Hamilton saw how the system they designed actually worked in practice they were horrified. Pledged electors defeated the primary purpose of the system, which was to defend against the populism, to promote continuity in the executive office, to shield the office from factional squabbles.   Hamilton actually began working on an amendment to specify how it was supposed to operate, but was shot by Aaron Burr before it could get off the ground. Madison himself was originally for a strict popular vote, but knew that it was not a realistic goal because there were so few eligible voters in the south (despite Virginia being the most populous colony, only white land owning males could vote, Virginia had less of a say then Pennsylvania or New York...)  A few decades into the 19th century, and most of the surviving founding fathers were all in agreement— the system of electing the president was disastrous and needed change. But they also acknowledged that this would be difficult because another process they designed had unintended consequences: it was too hard to pass amendments now that there were so many States! Getting 9 to agree on something is tough. But getting 38? Yikes!  No issue has received more proposed amendments than the Electoral College. It's currently at over 700. It only stays because at any given time, it benefits one party more than another. Currently no GOP state will vote to repeal it, especially because they lost the popular vote seven out of the past the elections.   Texas goes blue I could see the GOP getting on board to try to get rid of it. Or if somehow we get the national popular vote interstate compact passed. It would technically still exist, but the majority of actors would cast ballots for the popular vote winner. If that functioned for a few years, I could see the country moving eventually to formerly passing an amendment.",eh_steve_420,2025-04-27T04:09:02,2

So, no, not all votes are equal as they should be, or as they are often claimed to be.

CA, for example, the population represents 11.6% of the total US population; yet CA has only 10% of all electoral votes.  If electoral votes were actually based on population, CA would have 63 electoral votes, but instead, they are limited to 54 due to the limit of total electoral votes allowed nationwide for all 50 states.  (IMHO, these limits prove that the founding fathers never intended for the electoral college to continue for eternity - they planned for us to end it when America's population exceeded the limit of votes.)    But we didn't end it due to political party preferences - based on which party benefited from the EC votes vs the popular vote.

"The Electoral College is the only remaining balance between state sovereignty and federal authority, as well as between population density and geographic representation. However, the real problem lies in how electors are selected, the effects of gerrymandering, and the ""winner-takes-all"" system.  The ""winner-takes-all"" method must be abolished. Each elector should function as an independent vote, directly representing their district’s voters. This would eliminate the dominance of swing states and shift influence back to local voter regions, rather than entire states.  Gerrymandering must also be eliminated. Electoral districts should be drawn by an impartial, nonpartisan system designed to reduce political manipulation and ensure fairness to voters.  Electors should be chosen by the people of their respective electoral districts at least one year before the presidential election, and this selection must be entirely nonpartisan. Once elected, these individuals must be legally bound to cast their vote according to the will of the people they represent.  I support maintaining the current distribution of electoral votes based on population to preserve balance between larger and smaller states.   For example, California would retain its 55 electoral votes due to its population size, but those votes would be divided evenly among independently selected, nonpartisan electors, each chosen by the people of their district, not by a political party.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-29T10:42:22,1

The result was:   - 0-6 electors net change in every election, almost always under 1% of the total number of electors.  - It did not systematically make the result closet to the national popular vote.  - It did not systematically favor one party over the other.  - The only time it mattered was that 2000 went from a 271-267 to a 269-269 tie.

"That section of it died at that point. But it actually never really operated as it was supposed to.  The whole idea of pledge collectors was completely against the spirit.   The electors were supposed to act independently as experts.  It's purpose was to fight against populism.  People were supposed to pick electors who they trusted.  The electors were supposed to pick the president.   The founders actually thought that the electoral College wouldn't reach a majority most of the time and it would sort of act as a primary of sorts, and Congress would end up choosing from the top five, and after the 12th amendment, top 3, candidates chosen.    But very early on the system of pledge collectors emerged and states started awarding electors through the winner-take-off method so each state could maximize their influence.     By the early 1800s pretty much every founder considered the system of failure.   But by the 1820s they realized that the amendment process had become prohibitively difficult with almost twice the number of states that they started with.  Just like how they put you the electoral College, they didn't consider that the amendment process would be so damn difficult with more and more States.  Getting nine states to agree on something was difficult.  Nowadays we have to get 38.  That's almost impossible for any substantial change in the system. That's why so many changes that happened are through the Supreme Court interpreting causes differently rather than amendments, as was intended.    This is a major reason I think we ultimately need to scrap the current constitution and build a new one.   It was a very good first try.  But now it's the oldest constitution still enforce.  And it definitely is showing its age. Especially with the constitutional crisis we are currently in.   The only reason it lasted as long as it did was because so many politicians acted in good faith.   We are past that point.

I've heard some make the argument that third parties should do more in running candidates in district and state elections so they can make more of an impact in the US government.

Years ago, I used to be friends with someone who had previously been affiliated with a minor third-party (*I don't remember who they were though*), and I remember them stating (*something along these lines*) that there was already a sense of disillusionment from the beginning because even if they get a candidate to win a local race, it would not matter in the long run since the prospects of running a presidential candidate from their party to win the election are virtually impossible (*due to the EC)* and that their presidential candidate would only serve to act as a spoiler for the two main D and R candidates.  >Last election in Canada, the Conservatives actually won the popular vote but lost by number of seats elected.

By the early 1800s most of the founders saw as a disaster. But as Thomas Jefferson noted, the states were too numerous now to ever think of passing an amendment.   And that was another thing they realized they fucked up on.  They didn't design an amendment process that was scalable to a growing number of states.  Because of course they had no idea how the country was going to grow.  With the current 13 states simply expand their territory?  Would we slowly get new States over time?   They didn't know at the time that the number of states was going to double in a few decades.  Getting United States to agree on something was a tall order but possible.

Hamilton actually began writing an amendment to specify in more detail how he envisioned it to work.  With electoral districts where people would appoint electors and then the electors would independently choose the president of their choice.   But he was shot before this could even get off the ground.  By the early 1800s and especially by the early 1820s pretty much all of the existing founding fathers that were left hated the system how it came to operate.  But the amendment system they designed was just as flawed as the EC and it became way too hard to pass amendments with the number of states the country grew to entail.

Purpose was to serve slave states. States like Virginia had the biggest population but under a popular vote they would have very little influence because they would have had enough eligible voters. Does it took representation into account.   It's other purpose was to deflect against populism by making educated electors the ones who selected the president.  At the very least they thought it would have them select a group of people for which Congress could select from—they anticipated it to rarely reach a majority.     But the sister of pledged electors emerged very early on and the electors became largely symbolic.  Both Hamilton and Madison were irate about this. Hamilton actually began drafting an amendment to specify how it was supposed to work more specifically— namely that electors had real power and agency. But he was shot by the vice president before this amendment would get off the ground.,eh_steve_420,2025-04-27T04:48:46,1

The states are a cultural and political battle between an urban, large, dominating city, and the rural towns that cover most of the land.

"While u/Lefaid gave a great explanation already, I'll tack on some of my own thoughts. Some may be a bit redundant with theirs.  I don't really put much weight into the ""States have different needs"" arguments. While there may be some limited cases, by and large the different needs are either not really unique or special to a state (e.g., a lot of states have both expansive rural areas with farming, as well as some urban population centers), or are more regional rather than state specific (such as water usage/rights in the West.   I've lived in four states, some swing states with somewhat high population (in the top 10 or so), some small states, some East, some West, and I don't think that I could name a single issue that would be state-specific but need representation at the federal level. So these issues would be naturally getting attention from the House representatives of multiple states.  Another argument is that the Senate was made to represent the States, while the House was made to represent the people. While that argument worked initially, the nature of the government and country has dramatically changed. Between the Civil War (see [Out of War, a New Nation](https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2010/spring/newnation.html)), the New Deal, I don't think the ""union of independent states"" perspective is really plausible any longer. For better or worse, we have a much more centralized country and government.  Furthermore, the direct election of senators means that the Senate is in practice also representing the people, just in a severely imbalanced manner. I'm notionally open to a senate-like chamber, but with at least *some* population weighting, even if slower than the house.  Finally, the Senate being single-seat elections chosen by, usually, FPTP is off-putting to mean. The House being larger means that it could be switched to a multi-member election with proportional representation, which strikes me as vastly more democratic and representative than the Senate, and even the current version of the House.",Statman12,2025-04-26T08:29:20,1

"The population of the states had *everything* to do with slavery, in that much of the populations of southern states were slaves. The 3/5ths compromise was meant to address this very issue. States were to be taxed based on their population (as a proxy for economic output), but slave states believed that their representation in the federal government should reflect their tax burden, even if a large chuck of their population weren't free citizens. The compromise decided that for purposes of both taxation and representation, slaves would be counted as 3/5ths of a person. Thus slave states will be liable for lower taxation than their population would suggest, but not get as much additional representation in the federal government on the basis of slaves.  The electoral college is the application of the 3/5ths compromise to the election of the executive.

"At the time, we were a confederation of states, not colonies.  One group of delegates felt strongly that Congress shouldn’t have anything to do with picking the president. Too much opportunity for chummy corruption between the executive and legislative branches.   Another camp was dead set against letting the people elect the president by a straight popular vote. First, they thought 18th-century voters lacked the resources to be fully informed about the candidates, especially in rural outposts. Second, they feared a headstrong “democratic mob” steering the country astray.   The compromise was based on the idea of electoral ""intermediaries"". These intermediaries wouldn’t be picked by Congress or elected by the people. Instead, the states would each appoint independent “electors” who would cast the ballots for the presidency.  The founders failed to anticipate that states would adopt unit rules and select electors who were pledged to a candidate rather than using their independent judgment.    They also failed to anticipate that the House would be frozen at 435 in 1920. If it had continued to increase with the population, the electoral disparity between populous and unpopulous states would be reduced.   Urbanization creates vast disparities in states' electoral votes, but that's not what creates swing states. If the 12 most populous states were all red or all blue, they would have enough electoral votes to win the election.

"Yes, the winner takes all system is the much bigger problem -- the only thing I wanted to show is that if winner takes all was preserved but the EC was proportional, the result would pretty much be the same as with the slightly skewed EC we have.   Also to clarify: the electors were proportional to either total state population or to voter eligible population -- I don't remember exactly which -- not to number of votes cast in the state. So different turnout between states would not change the result unless another candidate would win the state.

"It is a huge problem from a democratic standpoint and you might think of other consequences that I haven't thought of. My point is simply this: the fact that it EC favors small states (the usual California-Wyoming argument), if all other parameters are held equal, does not meaningfully change the topline D vs R numbers. I must say that I was very surprised when that was the result of my calculations. To take the 2024 election as an example (I did this before the last election, so I didn't have the results beforehand):   Let's for simplicity of calculation ignore the Maine/Nebraska splits.   The EC vote in the current system was 312-226.   I'm taking population estimates for the US states for July 1, 2024. The total population in the 50 states and DC  is 340,110,988. This of course includes underage and other non-eligible voters - there's a case for voter eligible population instead, but I don't think it really matters.   For each state, we divide its population by the total population. For example, California has a population of 39,431,263, giving us roughly 0.11594 or 11.6%.   We then add upp the shares of all states won by Trump and Harris, respectively. Harris' share is 0.4231478284 - about 42% - and Trump's is then about 58%. What this tells us is that Harris won states corresponding to 42% of the US population. So if the EC was completely proportional between states, she'd get 42% of the electoral votes. More precisely, she should get 227.6535317 electoral votes, which we can round to 228. Trump should correspondingly get 310 electoral votes.   So the net result is a shift of two electoral votes from Harris to Trump, which barely would change the result at all. We can contrast this with the 49.80% to 48.32% in the national popular vote, which would correspond to 0.498\*538 = 267.924 electors for Trump and similarly 259.9616 votes for Harris. So approximately 268 electors for Trump and 260 for Harris, with the remaining 10 going to third parties and independents (about three each for Stein and Kennedy, two each for the Libertarians and ""other candidates"").   In this case having an EC without a small state bias would be *slightly* closer to the national vote (228 instead of 226 for Harris while the popular vote number would be 260, similarly 310 instead of 312 for Trump with a ""expected"" proportional number of 268). As I said this happens about half of the time, and the other half is slightly less close to the national vote.   Now you can probably find other arguments for why the unproportionality is bad - and I strongly agree that it is - but it is a significantly less important problem than winner-takes-all, which is what makes the numbers go from 268-260-10 to 310-228-0.   If you want an explanation as to why the unproportionaly barely changes the result, I think the answer is this: the partisan bias of large vs small states (by population) is not that large. Out of the 10 smallest states (including DC since it votes), Harris and Trump won five each. Out of the ten largest, Trump won 7 to Harris' 5. There is some bias in the number of red vs blue states as we see in the Senate, which can be explained by the fact that there are a number of red below-average-but-not-tiny states. Since the unproportionality in the EC itself is unproportional, that is, since the population per EV increases more than linearly with population, the fact that there are many small-ish Republican states is quite effectively counteracted by just one or two extra tiny Democratic states. The Democrats also dominate swing states in the senate, and the current swing states are on average large-ish states (Nr. 5, 8, 9, 10, 14, 20, and 31 by population). This further skewes the Senate numbers since they are ""bluer"" - more often won by Democrats - in the senate than in the EC.",Significant_Arm4246,2025-04-26T10:56:09,3
"I think there might be some confusion on which element is proportional, but by proportional I mean that the electoral votes are proportional to state population but still winner-takes-all. So it's the Senate - and House - effect that is quite limited in practice.   If the states allocated the votes proportionally, even with the skewed number of EC votes between states, the result would be quite close to the national popular vote. Just for fun, I computed different systems for 2024:   Current system: 226-312  If EC votes were proportional between states but still winner-takes-all: 228-310  With our skewed EC but each state allocates the votes proportionally: 262-275-1 (third party)  If EC votes were just based on national vote: 260-268-10.   So the winner-takes-all effect is by far the largest.

It would not benefit either party over the current system. Which honestly is a bit surprising.

"I think the commentor above you makes a really good point, but it also touches on two other points buried inside of it.     1- This is why some people argue that America is too big and too culturally diverse to try to govern as one country. But what they don't realize is that what they believe is a diversity issue, is actually a structural issue.     Many other large countries are as, if not more culturally and need-based diversity, and manage it successfully leveraging appropriate decentralization, proportional representation, multiparty systems, and institutions that flex and evolve around changing modern demographics and societal needs of their country.   The problem is American polarization and response to pluralism..    Part of what other people are pointing out is that America's  winner-take-all, two-party system exacerbates division by forcing complex cultural landscapes into binary choices. (And why the electoral college is so bad because it reduces the complex cultural landscape EVEN FURTHER by not representing population differences.    So going back to the commentor above you's point they kind of touched on, is that the electoral college actually gives sparsely populated states (that largely have monocultures as a result) more power than more populated states that typically have really diverse cultures. And by reducing it down to winner-takes all and low representation numbers, you're actually completely erasing inner-state diversity.   ---  To *actually* fix things we need more than to do away with the electoral college. We need to:  * A government that adapts to reflect evolving demographics and values. (I.e.    * Abolish electoral college for National Popular vote,     * Expand ranked choice voting   * Uncap the House to represent population growth accurately.    * Implement proportional representation instead of winner-takes all districts.   * Better decentralization where appropriate, allowing states structured flexibility. I e.    * Empower more state by state policy flexibility on things that aren't considered rights. (Education, healthcare, social issues, drugs)   * Go even further and empower **cities** to have control over things like taxation, housing transit, because that is where most of the diversity lies.    * Use the power of federal laws to protect civil rights, protect minorities, ensure voting rights protections, and prevent ""local tyranny""  but give cities and states individual powers over how to adapt their own governance structures and social services needed to empower those rights.  (Abortion rights here is a great example of local tyranny)    * Political reforms to better channel diverse voices into governance rather than polarization.   * Promote multi-party democracy over two party system   * Campaign finance reform + donation caps to prevent wealth from overriding the will of the people.    * Actively prevent / end gerrymandering   ---  So while yes, the electoral college needs to go, *just* doing that without fixing a lot of the other structural failures of our government is still going to lead to massive failure.

"Unequal voting power is not the main reason for why the EC differs from the popular vote. I go over the math in my longer comment.   The reason is instead winner-takes-all: The EC doesn't care about the margins in each state, so any further Democrats in California or Republicans in Alabama doesn't matter. The system relies on the fact that the states close to the EC tipping point are, broadly, reflective of the country at large. You can imagine a country with 50 states of equal population, so no uneven voting power. 24 of them vote 100% blue, the rest vote 49% blue and 51% red. The result would always be a Republican president, but the popular vote is approximately 75% to 25% in favor of the Democrats. The only thing that's needed is that the tipping point state is misaligned with the national vote.  In our world, a one-point swing in Pa, Mi, Wi can change the EC outcome but barley affects the PV at all. That's how we get results like 2016. Romney carried as many small (population-wise) states as Trump, but the tipping point state (Co) was a couple of percentage points more Democratic than the PV nonetheless.  Of course the EC should be proportional - or even better, not there at all - I don't disagree with you there.
