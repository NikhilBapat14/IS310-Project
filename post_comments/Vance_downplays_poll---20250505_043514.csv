"I really hope when we cut to 2026 or 2028 that all of this administration is investigated, and charged with treason for ignoring our constitution.  It needs to be addressed to send a message it will not be allowed to happen again. Then...they need to remove some powers from the executive branch and give state leadership the ability to vote down anything that oversteps their local decisions.  ",arilupe,2025-05-05T05:11:00,15

"There are the rules, and there are the norms, and there is the power to break them, and there is the power to enforce them.  Basically breaking rules/norms has been a pretty good strategy for trump et al because it takes a lot more power to enforce them than it does to break them.   A country that throws its former leaders in prison is a weak country, that is probably on the road to failed state collapse. Just a fact. He can push pretty hard on the boundaries because he seems to understand that.   In order for the forces hoping to enforce the rules and the norms to be able to actually do so, they need OVERWHELMING support from the population (from which power is derived in our system).   Long story short. Unless the voters STRONGLY repudiate trump (70% +), punishing him has pretty much the same consequences as letting him get away with it. The state fails. It just happens faster if they toss him in prison than if they let him skate. If Biden had tried to imprison trump we would be embroiled in a civil war. A faction with 50+1 support like the dems in 2021 does not have the power to successfully put down a rival. Rules or no rules.   Bonus fun-fact: historically, once a faction breaks the seal on norm-breaking, it’s pretty much impossible for the state to recover.  The true reaper of empires is norm-breaking elites.",pohl,2025-05-05T06:34:01,6

"Exactly!  The worst part is Vance acts like he's so ""tough"", but, deep down, he's an oversensitive beta boy who would probably cry if someone commented on his childhood. I normally wouldn't have an issue with men and boys who are sensitive or have traits otherwise associated with women and girls, but, I hate men/boys who pretend to be ""alpha"", but, are truly beta.",ToughAuthorityBeast1,2025-05-06T11:21:00,1
">A country that throws its former leaders in prison is a weak country, that is probably on the road to failed state collapse. Just a fact.  Case in point: Norway /a  Thumbing through the list, a lot of countries that arrested former leaders are/were already on the road to being failed states by that point, jailing leaders seems to be pretty ancillary.",axonxorz,2025-05-05T08:43:35,5
"I agree and disagree.  We're already weakened, not as far as military force etc., but by a leadership that had fundamentally thrown our constitution aside in favor of self interest.  The tariffs alone weakened trust in America from other countries, which now view us as chaotic and indecisive.  Our administration's actions appear strong, but the reality is dictators have fallen in the past and countries have risen up to success.  This is historical fact and those dictators were not allowed freedom and faced every bit of justice they were owed. That is real strength, standing up for our constitution and supporting justice when it's deemed necessary.  In this case it isn't just about how many people support charges being introduced, it's about protecting our constitution and pushing back on hypocritical tyranny.  ",arilupe,2025-05-05T06:54:33,2
"You are correct.  Imprisoning your prior leadership doesn’t make you a failed state, it proves you already were one. Avoiding it doesn’t avoid your fate, but it does put it off for a while.  Who knows maybe you have some miracle that restores norms in the meantime and you can carry on without all the unrest and suffering… this seems to be SUPER rare in the historical context.   Once the GOP got a taste for norm breaking self dealing, there aren’t a lot of proven routes back. The way we interpret the dems as weak or complicit because they fail to enforce norms is also a feedback loop that further undermines norms.  About the only hope we have is a MASSIVE repudiation of trump and the GOP. AND you need the right sort of leaders in the dem party at that time to press the advantage and use that power. AND an electorate that has been primed for the idea of restoration of norms and the rule of law being the prime objective of the new government.",pohl,2025-05-05T10:59:07,1
