States already control education. States control standards and local school boards adopt curriculums and books.   Dept of Ed was a funding source.  All this did was cut off money to schools mostly for kids with special needs.,Raspberries-Are-Evil,2025-03-21T00:40:26,53
"There’s no benefit to it. Curriculum and most policy or law is already decided at the state level, so all it really does is make it extremely difficult for funding to actually get where it needs to. States have absolutely no way to move those funds because they never in 1,000 years thought they would need to. That is the goal.   Who benefits? Charter schools and people with a vendetta against public education. This is a huge step towards making all education private rather than public. In general, business owners and the rich, elite class benefits with an uneducated population who doesn’t know their rights or history. We are already an extremely undereducated country, and this will exacerbate the problem severely.",JediGrandmaster451,2025-03-21T00:22:04,66
"Nothing really. so many schools in poorer areas will loose funding. and since taxation is not in the hands of school boards, districts will have to rely on cities or state governments to increase property taxes. that wont be popular with voters, especially in this economic climate. and this is if governments choose to do that. if they dont, then the schools will lose resources and staff, and most of all, students will lose education.",Iceberg-man-77,2025-03-21T01:18:29,8

"Educator here, administrator specifically.    States always had control of education. If anything the ED was just a resource for States and districts, not a supervisor.    Something like 92% of school district funds are local or state.    The States that give more than they get from the feds will see some budget cuts and layoffs but probably still be able to give some sort of decent education system if they want.    The welfare States should expect some school districts to go bankrupt and expect consolidation and an increase in privates and charters (which aren't inherently bad.)

"This strikes me as a naive question. I am not an education specialist, but to my untrained eye: the states have always “owned” public education. This was probably a throwback to the creation of the states themselves and the frontier days of hyper local control (hiring a school marm and building a ~~shed~~ schoolhouse). The federal department was created only in 1979 to address the predictable civil rights issues that resulted from state-by-state and hyper local control. So, it’s not a “shift” to state control; it’s a return to exclusive state control, with all that implies.",Johnsense,2025-03-21T00:33:53,10

Christian Nationalists are the only ones who benefit from it. When you get rid of the department of education there becomes no way for the government to enforce federal laws pertaining to education. That includes civil rights laws and laws that prevent religion from being taught or demonstrated in schools. Conservative Christians have made it clear that they want all children to be taught Christian values no matter what their parents think and this is their way of circumventing the law to get their way.,Motor_Roof2044,2025-03-21T01:29:41,5
"As others have said, control of education has already been primarily at the state level. One area that does have federal control under the DOE is in the requirement to provide special education and early intervention services for children with disabilities. To alleviate the cost of  providing education for children with disabilities, there are grant funds distributed from the DOE to school districts. By destroying the DOE I expect to see school districts drop special education programs, or increase local taxes to make up for lost funding. This means that areas with more need for special education are going to either struggle with providing services for children with disabilities, leading to worse outcomes for these children, or they are going to rely on the local tax base which is easier under a wealthier population. This means inequality of outcome for children with disabilities.   My fear, is that it will not take long for right wing media to blame social problems on people wtih disabilities. Much like the nazis did. By destroying programs that support these people, they will exacerbate societal problems and instead of analyzing the system, the right wing will use these vulnerable people as scapegoats.",Matt2_ASC,2025-03-21T11:57:42,2

"They were already controlling education. ""returning control of education to the states"" is code for ""we don't want states to teach slavery, nor do we want to educate poor people and minorities."" The DoE is there to provide funding to schools (because when school funding is tied to tax dollars, poorer communities will have worse schools). They don't control the curriculum. The sinister thing is that the Republicans know this. They also know that if they keep schools, most of which are in red states, that rely on this federal funding to exist in poor conditions, they'll have a consistant voter base (because education is the silver bullet).",Far_Mastodon_257,2025-03-24T10:20:09,1
One benefit to the state is that people within the state will have more voting control on their education system.   Zero education funding is being cut for special needs children and that’s been stated several times. That talking point is just a scare tactic from the left that’s easily proven false with a simple google search.   The benefit to the country is that a lot of wasteful spending is being cut with the DOE.,BNTMS233,2025-03-22T12:52:39,0
The federal government represents only 13.6% of education spending. Getting rid of the DOE doesn’t mean the federal government won’t continue to contribute.   Allocating to each state in proportion to the number of students would be an improvement. I live in a West coast city and I do not care if Oklahoma wants to teach the Bible in school.

Private and charter schools are inherently bad. The kind of school a poor kid would go to on a voucher has worse outcomes than the equivalent public school.

"Egg prices are a great example of whats causing general cost of living increases.  Trumps first term in office he deregulated industry, removing safety regulations, allowed them increasing amounts of freedom to do whatever.  He deregulated the USDA and FDA.  He appointed Powell who increased the money supply by trillions of dollars more than necessary, to reduce the debt of the 1% and promote investment by private equity and investment management companies....  This is in response a pandemic Trump is mostly responsible for, after cutting the staff of the CDC in China by 75%, removing the U.S. liaison to China, and removing the pandemic response team at the White House.  He increased tensions with China and used the CIA to spread disinformation about the Virus and the vaccinations in China which blew back internationally and into the U.S.  He then put up road blocks to combating the spread of the virus, actively promoted its spread, threatened local and municipal government who tried to contain the virus.  And then proceeded to illegal seize private sales of PPE...All while spreading massive amounts of disinformation about the virus and infection control procedures.  Then you have his tax cuts, tariffs and the rest of his bat shit insane policy.  Like trying to build an electrified wall across the border with a moat stocked with alligators and snakes, and spikes that can pierce human flesh.    And then there is Trumps private security being used to overthrow the Venezuelan government, sanctions on Latin America that lead to an increase in immigration into the U.S.  So now you have the corporate consolidation of business sweeping through the country manufacturing supply chain shortages to increase their profits.  The smash and grab mode of operation of private equity has become mainstream and costs as a result are skyrocketing.  Egg production is almost entirely controlled by private equity that kills off healthy egg laying hens and over crowds livestock to intentionally facilitate the spread of diseases like avian bird flu.  They increasing export greater amounts of product overseas to create domestic shortages to justify price increases.  This is the same industry that resists code changes that enforces fire suppression systems in barns after a dozen barn fires kill off over a million chickens.  Biden had them culling off diseased livestock after there were chicken to human transmission of avian bird flu.  The issue isnt killing sick chickens, its the condition that promotes increasingly sick chickens in the first place.  Which is what Trump is responsible for.  Instead of focusing on the root cause of cost of living increases, Trump is generating massive cost of living increases.  You can see it with egg production.  Trump told them to stop culling sick chickens, which results in more sick chickens which increases the chances of more cases of avian bird flu in workers and a wider outbreak.  Egg producers are not got to stop killing healthy chickens unless a law is passed, they want to keep their profits up.  The more unhealthy the livestock is, the lower output of product, the more chickens die from disease, the more money they can charge the consumer.  And Trump isnt lowering the price of eggs to the consumer by importing from countries he has tariffs on.  When more and more people get sick from avian bird flu it will become a public health crisis and end up costing the economy trillions of dollars.  This is just eggs, this is happening in every fucking industry.  A massive clusterfuck of epic proportion.  You have trouble getting your medication you need to stay alive?  Get fucked.  Its on back order now, and will cost exponentially more when it does arrive, if you are still alive.",neverendingchalupas,2025-03-22T20:34:38,2
"I’d argue that they are authorized publicly and privately run (especially in practice). To be fair, my teachers union is huge because my district is huge, but my union has absolutely zero ties to our public charters. Theoretically, they could try to unionize, but an established union for a district will have trouble actually taking them. It is a different board, and they would be starting from scratch. Potentially every single charter has a different board, which means the unions would need to negotiate the same number of contracts. That is a far different story than only having a handful of districts to negotiate for. That’s only one issue, too. There are plenty of reasons that charter schools aren’t unionized.

Our school population declines at the start of every year, then we get 50+kids later on, but never get the funding for them. The charter gets the funding for those kids. The next year, we need funding for another teacher position to account for the kids, but they don’t exist for the purpose of the budget. Not until next year, after they left because of big classes and terrible behaviors caused by the funding gap from the year before. Then the cycle continues. It’s fucked.

This article sort of refers to private schools and school choice interchangeably, so not all of the arguments fit. However, since charter schools are increasingly a part of the school choice movement, it might be worth a read;it’s your call, you don’t have to. Still, you can say what you want about principals and teachers, but too many charter schools end up being run by grifters and swindlers. By no means are all this way, but enough that I believe more oversight is necessary. Too many states exclude charter schools from different laws and regulations. [This website has an interesting comparison of key issues across all 50 states if you have time to kill.](https://www.ecs.org/charter-school-policies/) A lot of those issues are vital to public education, so I hold them closely.
