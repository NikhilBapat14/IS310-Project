"There's no such thing as democracy today. Democracy was about people holding all of the power and voting through the representatives they chose for each vote. Nowadays you can only vote for your local and national leaders and nothing else. Additionally instead of the voting being open and instant, since it was being done via representatives in an open forum, now the counting happens behind closed doors so it's prone to cheating.  We live under authoritarianism with democratically* elected leaders. But authoritarianism doesn't sound nice so people are being lied to that we just live in a democracy.  Edit: So many angry lefties DMing me about actually having a democracy. I really recommend you do some reading. Democracy literally means ""people rule"" from ancient Greek. At the very least we have a plutocracy (""rich rule""). The main characteristic of a democratic system was that the people decided everything, not a ruling class, they were just sending their representatives to voice their opinions for them as making everyone attend was unrealistic. Today you merely elect your leader based on their promises and after that you have zero power over anything. You just hope for the best. That's not a democracy. The election process also happens behind closed doors and is prone to bribery or the overseers being a part of the establishment and purposefully miscounting the votes. The voting process can also be manipulated in many ways. Don't DM me if you can't understand such basic things.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-04-23T06:26:52,19

"We do have deportation laws... sheesh... here is a synopsis. I didn't look up the specific laws.  The United States has several laws and regulations related to deportation. These laws are designed to remove foreign nationals who violate immigration laws or pose a threat to public safety. Under these laws, a foreign national can be deported if they entered the country without proper authorization, violated the terms of their visa, stayed beyond their authorized period, or committed criminal acts that make them a threat to public safety.  The deportation process typically requires the foreign national to appear before an immigration judge before the removal process can proceed. During this process, the individual may be held in a detention center while awaiting their court date. If the judge rules in favor of deportation, the receiving country must agree to accept the individual and issue travel documents before the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) can carry out the removal order.     If necessary, I can look up the specific laws.  This does not include the Alien Enemy Act and sadly from what I have read, they do have the right to due process in front of a Judge.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-23T13:33:37,54

"I kinda disagree, we have existing deportation laws, and the Trump side claims he's following them.  The left is suing because their interpretation of those laws are different, and the judges are imposing injunctions until the legal definitions can be sorted out.    Look at the Abrego Garcia thing.  Trump et al say his two 2019 immigration hearings satisfied ""due process.""  The left says he needs more, but can't define what that would look like.  The left is screaming Trump is defying the 9-0 SCOTUS ruling to ""facilitate"" his return, but they 1) don't have the same definition of facilitate as the rest of us and 2) ignore the rest of the sentence that says the admin does *not* have to ""effectuate"" his return.    Any *new* immigration or deportation laws will be subject to this same legal back and forth.

It’s technically not deportation unless they had been “imported” first.,RSKrit,2025-04-24T03:27:53,1
"They did in 1798, that's what the [Alien Enemies Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter3&edition=prelim) is for- this exact situation.  > ""President makes public proclamation of...any predatory incursion perpetrated...against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation...all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation...the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized...shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies. The President is authorized in any such event, by his proclamation thereof to direct the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States, toward the aliens who become so liable; the manner and degree of the restraint to which they shall be subject and in what cases, and upon what security their residence shall be permitted, and to provide for the removal of those who, not being permitted to reside within the United States, refuse or neglect to depart therefrom; and to establish any other regulations which are found necessary in the premises and for the public safety.""  Section 23 talks about judges, but their rulings are limited to ""conform to the proclamation or regulations established as aforesaid, and to imprison, or otherwise secure such alien, until the order which may be so made shall be performed.""  If the plane doesn't leave for two weeks, they can order the local jail to detain them until then.  Section 24 is the interesting one.  It talks about duties of marshals (in this case, INS, FBI, DHS, etc).  It says ""When an alien enemy is required by the President, or by order of any court, judge, or justice, to depart and to be removed"" as well as ""the marshal shall have the warrant of the President, or of the court, judge, or justice ordering the same"".  But it explicitly permits the president to order deportation on equal footing with judges.  The premise of Boasberg et al is that only judges are allowed to order deportations, yet the act says otherwise about three or four times.  It even limits judges to the regulations imposed by the president; if Trump says all gang members must be deported, the judges hands are tied.  The president can't personally deal with hundreds of individual cases, so the work is delegated.  However the criteria for removal and conclusion of the cases _are proclaimed by the president_, not congress.  Technically, the Alien Enemies Act is the proclamation of congress, they gave the power to the president, and the president filters that down to the judges.  Judges don't have to like it, but it's their duty under the AEA to implement it.  In short, Trump ""directs the conduct to be observed on the part of the United States, toward the aliens who become so liable"" and to ""establish any other regulations which are found necessary in the premises and for the public safety"", judges ""order such alien to be removed out of the territory of the United States"" according to ""regulations which the President may have established"" (the president himself may also issue such orders, per §.24), and 'marshals' do the apprehending and removals as ordered by either Trump or Judges.  If another country screws with us, they need to leave.  This is left to the current president, and not 'congress from 20 years ago'.  It isn't hard, but a lot of people want to stop Trump from everything he does, so they play make believe that any authority he has is fake.",Ghosttwo,2025-04-23T18:16:51,0

There are always people on each side complaining about fraud and rigging when they lose, but I don't see any evidence that anything bad happens except on a vanishingly small scale.  If there is any bias or anti-democratic stuff going on in PA, it is that the two-party system has a lock-hold on politics and this makes it much harder for third-party candidates to even get on the ballot, let alone get any votes. I think there are a lot of people who don't feel well-served by either party, and are frustrated that they don't feel like they have good choices at the polls, especially in Federal elections. I have felt this way a lot myself. These days it seems neither party comes close to being fiscal conservatives at least the way I interpret it.

I hate the way congress operates these days, passing big package bills. I think that if congress would instead break all legislation into as small a piece as possible and then just vote on them individually, it would fix a lot of the problem. I don't fully understand why they don't do this, but I think the two-party system is a major driving force behind why.  If I were in charge, I would abolish things like party whips (the idea kind of disgusts me) and I would take great measures to reduce the influence of the two-party system, through changes like moving back to a nonpartisan orientation for new congress members, unlike the party-segregated one we have had in recent years.",cazort2,2025-04-23T10:43:09,11
