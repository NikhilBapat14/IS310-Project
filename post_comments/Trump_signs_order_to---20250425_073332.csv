The cost of these minerals will be steep.,TintedApostle,2025-04-25T07:48:40,7
the cost will be very high for said minerals and the sea environment  would be destroyed,saiyanscaris,2025-04-25T08:02:28,4
It is not just the extraction;  it is  the processing of it that is expensive.  There are sources of them in many places.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-25T07:48:58,3
"[There is some evidence that magnese nodules produce ""dark oxygen""](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dark-oxygen-discovered-coming-from-mineral-deposits-on-deep-seafloor/), and may be beneficial to the oxygen levels in the deep ocean and the earth itself.",mrgeekguy,2025-04-25T08:20:14,1
Most likely so steep that they won't even be worth mining and no company will even attempt it.  Same reason we have 3000 open drilling permits that aren't being used. Because right now the price of oil is not high enough to justify the cost of dragging that oil out of the ground.,Deinosoar,2025-04-25T07:50:03,6
"Wouldnâ€™t a decrease in supply such as China cause an increase in prices? Thus potentially making it worth the cost to obtain these minerals. Obviously, this would increase the price of everything down the supply chain as well.",stonkstogo,2025-04-25T07:58:10,1
Not a problem for someone so hell bent to bring back coal and get rid of clean energy,Mundane_Quality8858,2025-04-25T08:54:00,2
"Exactly.  The morons eat this stuff up.  The right wing has been selling magic solutions for decades.  Star Wars, technology will solve every problem so why fix anything, american exceptionalism etc.  Its all to make the morons stop asking them to change or fix anything.    Its the ""invisible hand"" will solve it.",TintedApostle,2025-04-25T07:53:22,5
"Maybe, but the cost to the end products have to be understood.  It has to be a value only to US markets because of chief morons tariffs.",TintedApostle,2025-04-25T07:59:01,1
