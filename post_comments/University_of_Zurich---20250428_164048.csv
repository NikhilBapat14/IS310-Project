Least shocking news is that Reddit is manipulated by bots and AI.,DandierChip,2025-04-28T16:52:13,302
Plot twist - AI bot was manipulating other AI bots.,dottedoctet,2025-04-28T17:15:07,79
"This is just the tip of the iceberg lol  People infiltrated Kamala Campaign Discord Servers during the election where it was primarily focused on Reddit, narrative steering, front page coordination (gee I wonder why this nobody sub with a highest total upvoted post of under 1k suddenly gets 20k upvotes??).  There's your answer.   Democrats have approximately 20% favorability in national polling, yet the self proclaimed ""Front Page of the Internet"" silences any dissenting opinions through shadowbans, outright bans, or downvote campaigns.  Anyone that stumbles in will be made to believe that the favored opinion in the US is far left, which is all from misinformation campaigns and coordinated narrative steering efforts.  Honestly amazed this platform isn't investigated for election interference and terrorism organization.  Every Anti-Trump post has comments hinting that ""maybe protesting isn't enough"" suggestive comments that see no bans or removals.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-28T19:15:38,59
>Unauthorized experiment   There seems to be a lot of that going on these past several years. I guess 80 years is all it takes for those in charge to throw Informed Consent to the way side.,sowellpatrol,2025-04-28T17:27:51,36
"I train LLM’s, not surprised that they are that persuasive. They are able to apply rhetoric and logic to a degree that far exceeds the average person who doesn’t or isn’t able to adequately articulate his position.",Big_Iron_Cowboy,2025-04-28T17:11:11,28
"Given Reddit’s partnerships with OpenAI and Google, it’s no shock. With enough initiative, you could probably create a precise Reddit bot.  End up power mod of several subs and no one would know its a bot.",BloodMoney1,2025-04-28T19:58:48,6
"We have requested they apologize to us!  We also ask that they don't publish it.  -------------------------  Study is likely flawed since there are a variety of humans with different levels of intelligence and conversational abilities. Importantly, humans are not expert on every field. Likewise, they cannot exactly determine who is or is not a human on reddit.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-28T16:47:03,22
"The faux outrage over it being ""unethical"" to conduct a social experiment like this is such a hindrance to knowledge. There were some notorious scientific studies like the Tuskegee experiments, so now we have to throw the baby out with the bathwater.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-28T17:52:01,12
"Not surprised at all. While I have no love for blue haired leftists and their cult of violence and hate, we would be foolish to think all people arn't suseptible. This is just the beginning. Online communities are ripe for taking by manipulation.   Reddit has been actively manipulating people to think left and hate the right, politically. Other companies arn't stupid and see the profit and power that lies within that.   Just like the news. Depending on what channel you watch, I can likely name 99% of your beliefs and current gripes politically speaking.   While the left is far, far worse, both sides are being used and played against each other.",chances906,2025-04-28T19:50:20,5
"Somehow, this [isn't surprising](https://files.catbox.moe/ef1sdi.mp4) in the least.  Makes me really miss Reddit's golden age from about 2010-2016. Then after Trump won in 2016, all the astroturfing slop began. Feels like these bots patterns and weird logic have been obvious for at least the last 6-8 years now.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-04-28T20:31:58,4
"I bet many of ""my fellow conservatives"" and concern trolls here are bots.",dankhorse25,2025-04-29T10:45:26,1
Lol we already know from the covid vax that liberals don't care about informed consent. They're happy to subject you to an experiment without telling you.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-29T05:15:16,1
I argued with two idiots over the weekend about the judge in Wisconsin.  They both used almost identical sentences that were irrelevant to the argument at hand  Either they used AI to research the topic or they are getting crap from some discord server,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-28T18:02:38,99
"Not really a plot twist. That is the [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory). Though Wikipedia claims this is a conspiracy theory, that's a weird characterization. It is not a theory in the classical sense but more of an observation about the ever increasing frequency that bots are interacting with bots.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-28T20:22:06,22

"Same thing happened to the Canadian subs, when trump came in all of a sudden it went from a monthly high of 5k upvoted to 50k every day lol. Can’t wait to hear about Russian bots even though 90% of your comments will be removed for even discussing conservative topics.",Far-Try-8596,2025-04-28T21:39:48,9
Its probably less about it being unethical and more about it being a ridiculously effective way of herding the NPCs and their opinions.   The reality about the modern progressive movement is they have no real ideology. They will believe whatever their media overlords tell them to believe.,funny_flamethrower,2025-04-28T22:19:47,7
Exactly. If I start engaging too much on other subs I have to take a step back and remember who I’m “arguing” with.,DandierChip,2025-04-28T18:03:24,38
"I actually deleted my previous Reddit account and stopped using the site for ~2 years because I got so sick of the bot problem.  I'd been yelling about the bots and their obvious [patterns](https://files.catbox.moe/ef1sdi.mp4) of dogpiling, and using weird, circular arguments & insults for *years*, and just had enough of it. Guess I'm back now, but damn do I miss Reddit circa 2010-2016 before bots, shadowbanning and censorship from unbathed virgin moderators became as widespread as it is now.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-04-28T20:37:52,17
"Keep in mind that the next generations of AI models will be trained on the data from crawled websites which contain an ever-increasing share of AI-bot generated content and an ever-decreasing share of original, human thought. These models will inevitably become more and more self-referential.",Black_XistenZ,2025-04-28T22:51:31,14

It simmered down noticably after they election until they regrouped.  https://thefederalist.com/2024/10/29/busted-the-inside-story-of-how-the-kamala-harris-campaign-manipulates-reddit-and-breaks-the-rules-to-control-the-platform/,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-28T20:57:42,14
Signaling the end of the internet as a place of information sharing — and we get to watch in horror as it morphs into a propaganda web for some alternate reality. Reddit is so exceptionally bad it’s like a canary in the coal mine. But the problem surely exists in varying degrees across the internet now.,Szorja,2025-04-29T01:05:18,4
It really did. Reddit felt normal for a few days. Made me really miss what this place used to be.,NotaClipaMagazine,2025-04-29T08:03:46,2
