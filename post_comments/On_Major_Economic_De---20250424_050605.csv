"He is perhaps finally starting to realise that he is completely out of his depth and has fucked it all up. China will not talk to him until he lifts all the tariffs and even then it will demand free trade.  He cannot bullshit his way out of this one and has nowhere to run and hide. It is not as if he can declare bankruptcy and stiff his creditors as he has done so many times before.  Trump has discredited the US to the point where the USD and bonds are no longer safe havens. His insane rhetoric and arsehole policies have made international investors throw up their hands in horror.  The US has become a no go zone for tourists, business travel and conventions. Scientists and others are being fired or defunded and leaving for friendlier environments. US citizens are receiving messages from their government to self deport and he is refusing to repatriate a US edit: resident deported to El Salvador.  He has tipped the US into recession and without a strong currency and bond market it will not be able to pull itself out of it as quickly as it has before and this could lead to an economic depression.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-24T05:17:53,15

"Shitty title much? I know the New York Times can't just write ""On Major Economic Decisions, Trump is a Loser and Moron,"" but I have no idea what sort of conceptual imagery ""\_\_\_\_\_ Blinks,"" is supposed to convey. Like, is the global economy a staring contest, is that the idea?",pierre_x10,2025-04-24T05:09:36,6

"Watch, for his next genius hack, he’s going to announce his plans to single-handedly solve America’s housing affordability crisis and boost homeownership rates by demolishing every apartment complex, using the logic that if we remove all rental options, former renters will just have to build their own houses.   Economics is 90% logistics.",EggsAndMilquetoast,2025-04-24T06:19:25,2

Good.  On this we needed him to blink.  He was causing a catastrophe.,riggles1970,2025-04-24T06:47:39,1

It would at least not be actively trying to harm the country and the difference in odor would be negligible.,Savior-_-Self,2025-04-24T05:24:21,6
It is a traditional metaphor for giving in on a diplomatic standoff. It was used as early as the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.,makkdom,2025-04-24T06:48:39,3
Yes actually. Trump is trying to have a staring contest I.E. put china into a position where he wins. China is staring back I.E. refusing to even talk to him. The loser is the 1st to blink and in every scenario trump blinks. He folds and folds and folds.,chaotic4059,2025-04-24T09:58:28,3
"A blink in this instance essentially refers to the moment where someone loses their nerve. Stops in the middle of a fight or a race or contest and goes “wait…”   It’s important to correct mistakes, but it even better to not make them in the first place",KenUsimi,2025-04-24T12:17:31,1
"I’m pretty sure they’re talking about the man with a legal right to be in the United States or at least be deported to literally anywhere other than El Salvador. A better wording would be “refused to follow the court order not to deport a resident going through the legal processes in the United States, or the following supreme court order to return him.",Visual-Pop3495,2025-04-24T06:33:12,6

"Eventually it would start to dry and lose most of its odor. Since Trump fills his diapers on the regular with fresh loads, the odor in the oval would eventually be much improved.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-04-24T13:13:32,1
