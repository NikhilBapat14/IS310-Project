"What's fun is if you work most jobs your salary disqualifies you from Medicaid but ita not even close to enough to cover insurance or out of pocket costs. This happens all the time with DSS work requirements. They have a job so they can't get help for making too much but they don't make enough to afford housing, food, etc. The system could be made to help people throughout the process and towards independent living but instead it's made as byzantine and unhelpful as possible to discourage use. ",pfods,2025-04-24T08:19:40,13

Well Kansas was a cautionary tale of what happens when Republicans control everything and yet no one learned the lesson from it. Why would people learn anything now?,Prudent-Blueberry660,2025-04-24T10:31:07,1

"This is where expanded medicaid really needs a boost imo. In states where there was medicaid expansion I believe that the income limit is a little bit more manageable. IIRC, it's a little under 35k annually for a single person and then the ACA takes over, with subsidies offered to people who make under 50k-ish a year. I am not sure what the income limits look like in states that have no undergone medicaid expansion.    We honestly made some real progress there under Biden and Obama - we needed it to go even further to extend more into the middle class (or expand the ACA subsidies, regulate health insurance companies better to offer more reasonable premiums, literally ANYTHING) and instead it's being torn away from people completely. Just really really sad.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-04-24T08:46:09,4
Well yeah because too many people use it the system no longer works as effectively. It’s called tragedy of the commons. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T08:21:19,-3
"Yup. Not to mention, it's fucking cruel. There are many people out there who desperately want to be able to work but require medical treatment to get them functional again, whether it's due to physical or mental illness. These are not permanently disabled people, all they need is proper medical care (the nerve!) in order to become fully functioning members of society.   Doing it this way seems completely ass backwards and it's not gonna make America a saner or nicer place to live in the slightest.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-04-24T08:30:22,12
"What about people who are too sick to work but are not permanently disabled? What should they do, just go take tens of thousands of debt on to get them to a functional state? That sounds super sustainable.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-04-24T08:31:23,8
Except it's not tragedy of the commons because that describes unregulated public use of finite resources. DSS is one of the most regulated and complicated systems that the average person will experience from government. The are funds  are allocated. There is enough money already in the system. The issue is moral minded guidelines that prevent the system from working in a way that is actually helpful AND lifts people out of poverty so they don't need it anymore. ,pfods,2025-04-24T08:25:57,10
"Like, at least in my lifetime, we've seen how this plays out and it's not pretty.   Maybe instead of doing the bad thing, but again, we try just a *little bit* of this alleged communism I keep hearing about? Evidently we can just take shit away if we feel like, so what harm?    I wish someone in government would humour me.",ClusterFoxtrot,2025-04-24T08:34:06,5
They should have the right to apply for disability. Disability should be for people who can’t work and have medical problems affecting their health. However some disability should be temporary. Like being too sick to work but not being disabled. Have time to get better if a person can’t prove a permanent disability or condition ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T08:50:20,-7

Socialism/communism  is a disease. And it shouldn’t spread anywhere. Socialism/communism  sneaks up on you one small step at a time. It’s best not to take chances even with the smallest of steps. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T08:53:41,-4
"Wouldn't it be infinitely more cost effective to just treat the medical issues? There's a whole spectrum of illness. Many many people don't need time off work and to take from disability for a period of time to recover. They literally just need medical care.   I myself am speaking from experience on this. Particularly with mental health care. Certainly did not need to take from disability for it, I literally just needed to see a damn doctor and get proper medication while dealing with PTSD. That allowed me to function enough to find a job, which then got me off medicaid. It just seems backwards to immediately force people to apply for disability rather than addressing the real issue that plagues this country, which is lack of access to healthcare.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-04-24T08:57:23,8
"And for those who are permanently disabled?   I get social security survivors benefit because of being a disabled adult and was found disabled as a minor. My initial disability qualification hasn't gone away. However, I've gained more disabling qualifying diagnoses that have been added to my case file for why I'm permanently disabled.",SnooChocolates1198,2025-04-24T09:43:03,4
I believe they're saying it's over regulated.. which should resonate with everyone because I thought Republicans hate regulations and Democrats want to help people.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-24T08:58:09,8
I mean mental health problems is a form of disability. So would a woman being pregnant and giving birth be able to apply since it affects their health. Lots of things can apply to disabilities. Like you said not all are permanent. Access to healthcare is a slightly different but important issue. I’m just against abled body people taking money when they have no excuse too other than just being jobless ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T09:12:45,-3
Well they should have more care and added more benefits. To permanently disabled people ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T09:56:34,0
Then the trage dry of the common applies as he said it’s what happens when a finite resource has no regulations. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-24T09:08:16,-2
"I've never navigated the disability system myself but it seems incredibly backlogged, like it takes a very long time, and you end up with healthcare coverage in addition to a stipend anyway. So I don't understand why people who are able to work should jump through all the hoops to cost us as taxpayers more money in the end when it is literally cheaper and way more streamlined to just pay for the medical care they need to get working to begin with.   Average processing time for disability, including partial is 232 days. Federal law requires a state to make a medicaid decision within 45 days. It would honestly have been terrible if I was forced to go through the disability system rather than the medicaid system. I'm forever thankful I had that option, tbh.    I understand your point about people mooching off the system, I just find this to be an imperfect solution that might not meaningfully help the situation and could end up pigeon-holing people into relying on the system more than they actually have to. If the work requirement gradually kicked in (like if you're going to rely on it for the long term, it might be a bit more palatable from my perspective, honestly.) I personally don't think healthcare should be tied to employment at all, but that's where the ACA has some ability to bridge the gap.",lost-picking-flowers,2025-04-24T09:27:14,5
"And yet, the amount that they are cutting from the budget is absolutely going to kill off the very ability to provide care to the people who are permanently disabled.   I shudder to think of what is to come for people who are like me or worse. Especially the people who are in long-term care facilities like the elderly.  Of course, looking at what happened during nazi Germany in the time before ww2 broke out (when Hitler was expanding his influence outside of Germany), I don't have good feelings. Do you want to know the first groups of people who were targeted for ""extermination""? The lgbtqia+ people (who I call the alphabet crew), the elderly and super young, and the disabled.",SnooChocolates1198,2025-04-24T10:11:23,5
