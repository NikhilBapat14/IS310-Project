"If you've designed your system well, it shouldn't matter if an individual politician is anti-democratic or not.  No one position should have the power to decide to end democracy.       If a supermajority of congress or parliament is elected with explicitly anti-democratic policy positions, then you have to contend with the fact that the people are voting to end democracy.  And there's no real way around that.  If people don't want democracy, you can't force it on them.",Nothing_Better_3_Do,2025-05-02T18:48:23,14
"In healthy democracies, gatekeeping is actually a thing. It's fundamentally undemocratic, but it tends to protect the system overall. Our modern primary system in the US was the end of gatekeeping as we know it. Parliamentary systems with closed lists, or where party leaders are elected (partially or completely) by insiders, also gatekeep. It's a way of ideally filtering out demagogues and authoritarians.",Loraxdude14,2025-05-02T20:56:52,7
Is it inherently anti-democratic to exclude an anti-democratic candidate from election? I believe it is.   You can’t claim a true democracy while simultaneously excluding anyone from an election.   Your scenario is a paradox. ,MetallicGray,2025-05-02T22:18:35,8

"Of course.   We should not allow people to ""use the stones to destroy the stones"" (so to speak).   This is a fundamental flaw of democracy that needs to be addressed - it has no immune system to protect itself.   Elon is aware of this and hints at it when he says (paraphrasing) ""the fundamental flaw of the western world is empathy"" - he is of course being a racist fucker and referring to refugees being given protected status when he says this. But in saying this - he has revealed the fact that he thinks it's possible to play at peoples' sympathies to gain power.   This perfectly aligns with what we see his chosen president doing - playing semantic uno reverso tactics to portray themselves as the victim of anti-democratic plots. All the while they actively destroy the separation of powers, undermining congress, etc. It's DARVO.

"(American) As much as i hate these candidates and spefically what Trump represents I think people should be able to vote for whoever they want.

Do I think the felonies Trump was convicted of shoudl have barred him from office? Yes, do I think that the obvious danger he poses to the constitution should prevent him from office? No. Every single election would be two camps trying to get the other one barred from running for office, it would be awful and would push us deeper into being undemocratic.

"No.  In the July 1932 election in the Weimer Republic, the Nazis won 37% of the vote (230 seats) and the Communists about 15% (89 seats). The Nazis openly declared they entered the Reichstag “not as friends… but as mortal enemies” of the system.  This meant that by 1932, a majority of the Reichstag (if you combine Nazis and Communists) was actually opposed to the democratic parliamentary system itself.   If you allow that, society has already collapsed. Guess what happens when a public is dissatisfied with a legislative body that fails to act? The power of extremists balloons and factionalism erodes the country until nothing is left.  The Nazis knew this, and exploited it. They embraced procedural chaos, forcing session to degenerate into shouting matches, walkouts, and endless no-confidence votes.  Between December 1930 and April 1931, the Reichstag managed to enact only 19 pieces of legislation, whereas President Hindenburg issued 2 emergency decrees in that period. By the end of 1932, the balance had flipped dramatically – only 5 laws were passed by the Reichstag in all of 1932, versus 59 emergency decrees issued by the President.    The only thing the chambers could agree on was throwing out chancellors, voting 512 to 42 to oust Papen's government in 1932, leading to President Hindenburg appointing Hitler as chancellor.  During the Great Depression, with the German mark hyperinflating and many Germans desperate for relief, Hitler exacerbated the problem of legislative gridlock and provided his Nazi regime as the sole solution for gaining back some popular support and ending the political stalemate.    In essence, this positive feedback loop can only be stopped at the source. If anti-democratic candidates are prevented from holding office, they must reform. If they are allowed, that doesn't happen, and instead they force the system to bend towards their will. By discrediting institutions, they bolster themselves, in a cycle deadly to any republic.",ManBearScientist,2025-05-02T20:53:45,2
"Yes and No.  Yes, because being “Anti-Democratic” is ultimately a judgement call over the various political positions a person takes and works to enact and objectivity doesn’t really exist, so it’s easy to say “such-and-such is anti-democratic” and use that to prohibit them from serving in Government. See everything Republicans say about Democrats.  No, because OF COURSE BEING ANTI-DEMOCRATIC IS WRONG. The social contract ultimately exists because we the people agree to give up certain avenues of behavior (for example, murder) in exchange for certain protections as provided by a collectively ratified body (for example, being protected from murder). We accept laws that bind us in exchange for laws that protect us, and part of that acceptance is having a say in what those laws are, and the best way we have worked that out is with Democratically selected Representative Government. Someone who works to undermine the idea of democratic selection is someone works to break our ways of enforcing the social contract. See everything Republicans do to Democrats.  I feel that being Anti-Democratic should, outside of very carefully agreed upon and clearly delineated edge cases, not be made illegal, because it will absolutely be used as a bludgeon against political opponents. How many votes are thrown out because Republicans have used the rhetoric of being in favor of Democracy to undermine its actual implementation? Hell, we have the Republican President calling for the arrest of sitting members of Congress, Democratic Governors, and actually arresting judges because he doesn’t like how they fetter his power, and he says that his enemies are the ones working against democratic representation.  Donald Trump should have been thrown in jail to rot like drowned rat, but the solution isn’t giving him a tool to prosecute his enemies. We already have tools to throw him in jail for the laws he broke, we just have a broken Justice system that didn’t prosecute him until it was too late.",StanDaMan1,2025-05-02T22:31:33,2
"We're too corrupted not to simply ban opponents out of political convenience. If not that, then it'll be out of fear because that's exactly what they'll do if we let them.

"The rise of populist authoritarianism is paradoxically the result of too little democracy, not too much.  Take Trump. His 2016 victory came down the Electoral College. His 2024 victory may have come down to a lack of a Democratic Party primary (though this is impossible to say definitively). Furthermore, a purely majoritarian democratic system would mean getting rid of things like the filibuster, which has hobbled Congress' ability to act and skewed the courts, causing the sense of disappointment in the government that makes authoritarians attractive options.

"Wow, reading some of the peoples statements here in this thread make me question humanity itself.      First off: what is a democracy?       ==> a democracy is the rule of majorities. It's goal is to find the most beneficial solution for the most amount of people, to maximize public good. It is, basically, Kants political ideom => utilitarianism.   How is democracy looking to achieve that?   ==> By public discourse. People are supposed to share their world views, exchange, attack and defend each others arguments, to find the solution that has maximum overlap with the majorities needs.   That is the democractic principle.       The idea that you exclude people from this process is, fundamentally, undemocratic. It is against the very idea of democracy. The idea that you don't listen to others (for whatever reason) is undemocratic. Other people are, by definition, part of the solution. Always.  Listen to their arguments, attack and defend them. Oh and btw: calling people ""dumb"", ""bigots"", ""faschists"", ""Wokeists"" etc. is not an argument, its a personal attack and thus: anti-democratic itself (cause its an attempt to drive people out of public discourse).",Electrical_Estate,2025-05-05T04:52:26,2

"Here’s my take:  No, anti-constitutional candidates should not be eligible to run. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and my conclusion is that there are clear mechanisms in constitutions on how to amend and change them. A simple majority of voters should not be able to change the constitution by electing a candidate who promises to upend the constitutional system. That’s a violation of the constitution, and a simple majority of voters do not have that power any more than a majority of Congress or parliament. And fundamentally, a constitution only functions if elected officials actually adhere to it.   Furthermore, the constitution is not simply there to give the majority of voters whatever they want. It is also there to protect the minority: the people who did not win power this round. Allowing the majority to ignore the constitution puts the minority at risk and violates their constitutional rights. The minority is guarantee the right to life and prosperity too, regardless of their politics. They are also guaranteed the right to pursue power in the next round of elections.   So therefore, anti-constitutional candidates should not eligible for office, regardless of the desire of the majority of voters, since they threaten the constitutional rights of the minority.   It is tricky to determine who would not be eligible based on this criteria. In the US system I guess the Supreme Court would be the body best positioned to make this determination, but that body seems too broken at the moment to have been effective. Maybe the US is too far gone.",AlexandrTheTolerable,2025-05-02T16:39:50,3
"Does supporting term limits for legislators mean you're anti-democratic?  In the US context, are people who support voter ID laws inelligible, or people who oppose them? You can make a pretty solid case either way  Every president since FDR has usurped the power of Congress in gross violation of the constitution, by pre-FDR standards. Every president since Lincoln has usurped the power of the states in gross violation of the constitution, by pre-Lincoln standards. Is our understanding of democracy not allowed to evolve anymore? Do you wish someone had imposed such a rule before Lincoln and FDR?  The unfortunate fact of the matter is, ""anti-democratic"" is subjective, and ultimately the people determine what democratic norms are. I often hate their determination, but any attempt to keep them out of the process is itself anti-democratic",InterstitialLove,2025-05-03T03:07:25,2
"Government, and systems of government, evolves over time. Ancient democracy is very different from modern democracy, just as the separation of powers, judicial independence, and equal rights for women, minorities, etc are relatively recent innovations when you look at governments since the beginning of written history.   It is not impossible that in the future, better, potentially non-democratic forms of government can be better than the current systems and models we have. It is also possible that some of the long held theories of what is just and fair can change.  The fundamental benefit of democracy is that these changes are possible without a violent revolution against government in power. Autocratic governments generally do not have built-in methods of changing the government when mistakes are made, or policies become severely unpopular.  If we can agree that both extremes of mob-rule/tyranny-of-the-majority and oligarchy-tyranny-of-the-minority are anti-democratic. then what is anti-democratic and what is not becomes subject to debate, and often without clear answer.  At a high level, IMO, as long as an electoral candidate and government is open to and allows the ability to change policy/laws within a reasonable time to evaluate their effectiveness, that is all that's needed for a candidate to qualify for elected office. Society and government will always make mistakes because the future is unpredictable, so the most important factor is the ability to correct these mistakes, whether they are injustice, incompetence, ineffective, inefficient, illegitimacy, etc.   Democracy just happens to be the current best solution to the problem of dealing with the externalities beyond the control of individuals, but it is not inconceivable that there can be better alternatives.",angus725,2025-05-02T20:32:36,1

"Do I think they should be? Obviously not or at least not in a democracy that isn't exploring the option of transitioning to a non or less democratic system.  Any government committed to maintaining a democratic system (and yes, that is a matter that should be open for debate but it can also be something that is core to the country's ethos) needs to exclude dialogue that is opposed to democracy. The modern capacity for spreading information is unprecedented and that information is often propaganda and disinformation **and** that has been shown to be incredibly efficacious.  We are also seeing a transition where entities that are non or limited in terms of representation have significant advantages as a result. China, Singapore, the whole of East Asia to some extent all are showing their ability to adapt more rapidly because while they still need the support of their people, they don't need to consult them on policy.

Most democracies fail because of coups or falsified election results. As for the Trump phenomenon. The fact that he and his sidekick have publicly stated their profound knowledge of the voting machines and their software. Why and how is that a Democratic election necessity? It only becomes relevant when there are nefarious people who feel the need to understand those machines. His own personal actions, or lack of them, speak volumes to the subject. Every previous election where Trump lost or his performance was overzealous and grossly inaccurate when he won. Yet this last election, where his performance numbers were undeniably worse than previous, but he still won. He even won the popular vote, though it was one of the lowest voter turnouts in recent history. He did rant and scream about fraudulent elections he did sue numerous states for election fraud. (In many of those cases where he called the votes wrong, other races for political candidates were won by Republicans in the same elections and the same machines.)

"Well, yes there is actually.  Art 19 of the German Basic Law discusses the governance of political parties.  It specifically states that ""Parties that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their adherents, seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be unconstitutional.""  It goes on to state that ""(3) Parties that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their adherents, are oriented towards an undermining or abolition of the free democratic basic order or an endangerment of the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be excluded from state financing. If such exclusion is determined, any favourable fiscal treatment of these parties and of payments made to those parties shall cease.  (German Basic Law Arts 19(2, 3)).  The same article then gives the Federal Constitutional Court the power to decide on what parties are or are not constitutional.    This power was important enough that, in December of last year (2024), the Basic Law was amended to safeguard the structure, processes, and powers of the constitutional court from undue influence.  You're right in that laws are up for interpretation but that's why institutions are so important to having a functional democracy.   [https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch\_gg/englisch\_gg.html](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html)  Of course, at the extreme end, the power of the constitutional order itself is questionable as you can always start a revolution, but at that point, holding elections and all institutions of government are also a moot point.

"It's a challenging topic. You said this is not specifically about the US, but that is where I live so my perspectives are influenced by my personal experience and limited knowledge of other societies, of course.  I once thought that to have a well-educated society, you needed to raise the entire society above basic needs, not unlike a Star Trek future where food, clothing, and shelter are the baseline and currency has been eliminated and everyone is free to pursue intellectual interests. If people are struggling to provide themselves with food and housing, they are not really going to care about the views of philosophers on the best ways to maintain an optimal society nor would they have time, even if they did show interest.  I heard that a country in the Middle East, perhaps UAE, provides a basic income to every citizen. If that covers necessities, then perhaps those people are free to pursue art, science, philosophy, and such. However, my very limited knowledge of that society seems to indicate that doesn't happen. You still get the normal range of human behavor.  Now, I think that human experience is necessarily relative. You know only what you experience. If you grow up in lavish wealth, then living on 100,000 USD may seem a punishment. No matter the enivronment, the normal range of human behavior will appear. Even when all the basics are met, you will still get people who fight the system, who want to do something different, who develop rage at perceived offenses, and even people who would destroy everything so that they alone can be in charge.  I don't think there is a perfect answer. I don't think anyhing we can do will make for an enduring solution.  However, coming from a US perspective, I do wonder if the rules we put in place over 200 years ago are enough to hold.  As you mentioned, many people are getting bad information, much of it from mere ignorance and some highly intentional by bad actors. Ideally, there would be some way to suppress bad information.  The First Amendment to the Constitution includes ""Freedom of Speech"" and ""Freedom of the Press"", which effectively mean that the government is powerless against bad information. The US government is not allowed to suppress that information because the people don't trust the people in government to not abuse such power. A cynical view is that the people are so afraid of abuse of power that they made the government powerless against the very real threat of propaganda.  From that experience, my instinct says that Germany's approach to limiting some political speech is better. To me, it seems reasonable that having some trust in the government works out better.

"There actually is a very good reason why a judge or a panel of judges is better positioned to decide.  A judge is an expert in law; and thus, the constitution.  A judge has training to better hear arguments and weigh the significance of their decisions.  Additionally, judges who decide such cases are usually pretty senior and have spent much of their careers making such decisions.  If nothing else, I would be very surprised if a  judge who wants to decide constitutional matters has not read and studied their respective constitution and legal systems in full; whereas, I would be surprised if every politician in the US or even in my own country has actually even read our constitutions.    It's probably worth critiquing the practice of electing judges through direct democracy.  It's actually quite unusual and subjects the judiciary to popular partisan political pressures.  In many countries, judges are insulated from partisan political pressures by having professional bodies or parliamentary committees select judges based on their merit.  Political oversight is sometimes given by giving the head of government or head of state final say over who's appointed but the exact selection usually restricts their hand.  Whilst it's common to refer to judges in the US as republican or democratic, it's probably better for democracy to have non-partisan judges who make such decisions.",clios_daughter,2025-05-03T04:25:10,1
"Thanks for engaging with such an interesting comment!  Yeah, we’ve been sliding down this path for a long while. No question. If those other mechanisms worked, I guess we wouldn’t be having this conversation.   The main mechanisms to keep the president in line are the Congress, the courts, the media, and the voters. All of them seem to have failed.  The Republicans in Congress who would support stopping Trump seem to be afraid. The courts are standing up to Trump, but he seems poised to ignore them. The mainstream media is standing up to Trump, but people don’t trust them, so they turn to Fox or social media and get horribly misinformed. The voters…well…they’re misinformed. So all the checks have failed after a couple of decades of being attacked.   What now?  I personally think MAGA ultimately is held together by a broken information system.

"You make an interesting point on how the US legal system works in that it's very backward looking.  It reveres its constitution almost as if it was written perfectly 200 years ago.  The last time the US constitution was amended was the 26th in 1971 (I find it hard to include the 27th amendment in this since it was written contemporary to the first set of amendments).  Yet, if one actually reads the US constitution, it's quite clear that it's an imperfect document.  If nothing else, it's not very well organised.  Consider Art 1 s.9 which discusses habeas corpus, taxes, titles of nobility, and ex post facto law; or the 2nd amendment which can be fairly read as to give everyone the right to bear arms, or could be fairly read as creating a militia made up of common people and not professional soldiers, for the purpose of national defence.  The Canadian constitution written about 100 years later is organised into sections that are, frankly, more coherent --- even though several sections (namely 18, 41) of the 1867 act more-or-less says that the Canadians will have a system like the one in the UK lol!  More concerningly however is that the US constitution was very idealistically written --- almost feeling as if their head was in the clouds.  This isn't unusual in itself --- though the Canadian constitution reads like a dreary act of the UK Parliament (it fairness, it was) --- as constitutions embody what a country should stand for but the American constitution takes it to a whole different level proclaiming unlimited rights with few caveats even when it would be prudent to add the air of reasonableness.    Consider freedom of speech.  The US 1st amendments reads ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""    In Canada, freedom of speech is protected in 2(b) of Schedule B of the Canada Act 1982 (Constitution Act) (See what I mean, dreary! :p).  It reads that ""Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms ... (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;"" but is limited by s. 1 reading ""The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.""    The German Basic Law, like the American one, is very proclaimative stating that ""Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship."" (Art 5(1)). However, Art. 18 states that those who abuse their freedom of expression for the purpose of subverting democracy will forfeit such rights.    At least in the Canadian context, much of its constitutional law was written to attempt to correct perceived mistakes in the American system seeing as how as the British North America Act was being drafted, the US was just recovering from, perhaps the ultimate failure in government, a Civil War(the Union of Canada in 1867 was largely done in consequence of the American Civil War over fears of US annexation --- oh how things change).  As such, it incorporated safeguards to prevent future problems. Perhaps the largest mistake in the US constitutional system is this assumption of its perfection.  In practice, freedom of speech in the US is already subject to reasonable limitations (otherwise, uttering threats and incitement would be legal).  Perhaps the US needs an open ended amendment simply stating that the constitution ought to be read in a manner to protect democracy, or at least ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" (<another very high-minded statement).",clios_daughter,2025-05-03T05:30:09,1

"Yeah. It may be too late for America. Or at least not until someone else gets enough power to make a difference. But your point is definitely an important one. I don’t have a perfect answer, and any mechanism can be abused. But there are certainly patterns and organizations involved in pushing propaganda. Phrases like “Stop the steal” for example are most effective when repeated over and over again. And that is pure propaganda. So I believe it is technically possible to identify propaganda and stop or slow its spread by looking at the patterns of what’s being said and where it’s coming from.  Once identified, algorithms can lower the ranking of propaganda so that very few people see it.   Americans have freedom of speech, but there’s no guarantee of freedom of reach. The stuff that’s being seen by millions of people today wouldn’t have made it past the “crazy guy with a tinfoil hat yelling from a soapbox” just a few years ago.

The US had it quite good for the last several decades and people largely ignored government. Many never bother to learn how government works, what it does for us, or how to contact their representatives. It’s so bad that most seem to believe that the President is the head of government and that everyone reports to him like the CEO of a corporation.  They also ignore law, including the Constitution. They don’t know what actions are legal or not. If they are getting what they want, they don’t care. If the President seems to get away with something, people assume it must be legal.  They don’t realize that the legal institutions report to the President, who has control over who gets prosecuted. This is largely why the Supreme Court ruled that the President’s official actions are effectively legal. It’s up to Congress to remove him as a political action.  Now, when gross abuses are rampant, people don’t see or understand the problems. Even once they realize there is a problem, their instinct is merely to complain on social media rather than contacting their representatives. There is a huge learning curve for those people.

"The US is perhaps one of the worst examples for functional, non-partisan institutions though because, at the core, there are so few nonpartisan institutions in government. The US even has a politicized judiciary which has been openly acknowledged for decades. The US also has a politicized method for setting electoral districts — what could possibly go wrong.  In most other democracies, both of these critical areas are set mostly through non-partisan means.   If a country was to attempt to exclude an anti-democratic party, they likely shouldn’t use the US as an example as the institutions that would permit this would likely be either a mechanism within the judiciary — a court would decide based on a criteria set out in law whether or not a party was anti-democratic — or an independent commission would decide based on advice from experts on democracy, academics, or interested parties. Whatever mechanism is used, there would need to be a way to exclude the toxic partisanship that exists US democracy.   I should emphasize that I’m not saying this as an insult to Americans; however, the inability to make meaningful decisions together is quite irregular. Indeed, in my country, “US style politics” is used as a byword for aggressively dysfunctional partisanship.  Politics does not have to be the way that it exists in the US.

"Can you substantiate or at least elaborate on this?  It seems to work alright in Canada, the UK, France,  Germany, etc.  The only Western country that comes to mind where the system of judicial appointments is failing is the US, where judges are sometimes elected and are otherwise, often subject to, at times extreme, partisan pressures.  Liberal democracies need to have functional legislatures where courts to interpret laws --- some of those laws can be designed to act as a check on power.  Ultimately, the legislature can still rewrite and amend the laws which the courts judge.  Whilst some countries like Germany have so-called eternity clauses granting rights that cannot be amended, they're usually quite narrow in nature protecting very basic and fundamental rights who's elimination would spell serious questions as to the perpetuation of a democratic order that respects basic human dignity.  In the German example Art 79 of the Basic Law prevents the amendment of the first 20 Articles of the German Basic Law.  These articles protect human dignity, personal freedoms, equality before the law, freedom of faith and conscious, freedom of expression, arts, sciences; family rights, education, assembly, association, privacy, movement, occupational freedom, conscription, the home, property, socialisation, citizenship, asylum, petition, when rights can be restricted, and resistance against people seeking to abolish the constitutional order.  Whilst you're not wrong in that it's less democratic than an absolute democracy, I would argue that this is probably better for the dignity of humans to have some restraint on what politicians can do.  Moreover, some countries like the UK have doctrines of Parliamentary Sovereignty which means Parliament can make and repeal any law it chooses to; hence, in such a system the court answers to Parliament, the democratically elected body.

"So there's actually recourse if your rights are overruled or limited by the government first in court, and second, in an election.  Firstly though: can you name a single right given to an individual that exists in any country's constitution that is not, in practice, subject to reasonable limitations?  The Charter just says the quiet part out loud and, by doing so, makes it transparent.  Even the famed US 1st amendment is, in practice subject to reasonable limitations.  Inciting a crime, child porn, fraud, etc. are still offences.  All of these restrict the exercise of free speech but I'm not sure how many people would think we would be better off without these reasonable limitations.  Moreover, the reasonable limitations clause is subject to the Oakes test requiring that the law which places a limit on rights is for a pressing and substantial reason, the restriction must be rationally connected to that reason, that the restriction on the right is minimal, and that the restriction proportional to the importance of the aim.  Do you feel this is unfair?  You couldn't have prisons without reasonable limitations.  Say your religion required human sacrifices which would be protected under s. 2(a) but places it in conflict with the victims's s. 7 right to life.  Where does the border get drawn where one's rights begin and another ends?  This is what reasonable limitations are.  The recourse is to demonstrate that the restriction is not reasonable.  If the government cannot justify in a court of law that the restriction is reasonable, the law gets struck down.  The Notwithstanding clause (s.33) is problematic but not nearly as bad as you make out.  It allows fundamental freedoms, legal rights, and equality rights to be waived on a temporary basis for no more than five years.  S. 33 does not waive democratic, mobility, language, aboriginal, equality of the sexes, or multicultural rights.  Whilst I would rather we didn't have s. 33, since 4(1) (election every 5 years) cannot be overruled, it does effectively force the government to defend their actions to the public in an election since the act invoking s. 33 essentially expires and must be renewed or allowed to die every five years.  There's an argument to be made that if that government can convince the public in a free and fair election that they should remain in office despite explicitly overruling the public's own rights, that ultimately, in a democracy, it is the people's will.  The recourse to the use of the notwithstanding clause is an election.  If we're too dumb to stand up for our own rights when we vote, it's on us...  Our democratic rights cannot be overruled by s. 33 and, whilst they are subject to reasonable limitations, the only reasonable limitation that comes to mind is a minimum age to vote and citizenship requirements.  The courts have ensured that inmates can vote, and citizens living abroad can vote.  I don't see other major likely exceptions.  (1/2)",clios_daughter,2025-05-03T16:20:51,1

If flat earthers make you mad, that means you're posting. So long as you're posting, you're engaged and making them money. That's all that matters to a company. They don't care if it turns you inside out. It isn't just that though. It also appeals to base instincts that shouldn't be validated. They want you hooked; they don't care how.  Now you get rage-bait, validation porn, ads, scams, and in the mix somewhere are your friends and family.

"This is the clause, Art 79(3)  (3) Amendments to this Basic Law affecting the division of the Federation into *Länder*, their participation in principle in the legislative process, or the principles laid down in Articles 1 and 20 shall be inadmissible.  To what do you object?  Whilst Art 79(3) is indeed a limitation democracy, it's limitation seems quite reasonable in that surely democracy must be founded with a basic respect for human rights.  Arts 1-20 merely enumerate these rights, enshrines that the German state must respect always democracy and basic human rights, and gives Germans the right to resist unconstitutional regimes.  These articles were enshrined to prevent a government from usurping the legal and constitutional order since the previous attempt at constitutional government lead to the NSDAP taking over.  Do any of the articles enshrining basic rights actually have any significant overreach such that the restriction on democracy is unreasonable?    I am attaching the English version of the German Basic Law below for your reference.  If you prefer the German, please include with your reply the precise articles and sections you object to as my ability to read German is merely at the beginner level.  The only thing odd I see about the section is that it enshrines that Germany will be a federal, not unitary state though this so fundamentally changes how government works that a rewrite of the constitution would probably be necessary anyways --- that and for the changes it would require, there would be little tangible benefit to justify the cost.  In any case, it's enshrinement really doesn't materially effect the ability for democratic institutions to function effectively, certainly not enough to justify your assertion that they're only 'nominally democratic'.

"The very basic issue is that knowledge and ego are a very explosive mix, when combined with dogma and the complete rejection of expertise, nuance, and doubt, you get stupidity. There is really nothing new in this regard since time immemorial, you can find it in writings all the way back to Ancient Greece.   > Smart people learn from everything and everyone, average people from their experiences, stupid people already have all the answers.—Socrates   Starting from the very basic premise: reality is real, and building up from our intersubjective experience (the way that science works) is what makes wise people wise, but society has relegated this space to religion and let it rot under religious dogma. But ever since the Greeks there have been many secular traditions that pursue wisdom, and the higher echelons of most big religions do as well. However this doesn’t reach the common man.   Enlightened wise people are everywhere, just not in numbers large enough to make a difference, but what really makes it worse is that the stupid see themselves as wise, and the wise as stupid. They see true leaders as bullies, and truth is nothing more than a random story to tell.  We have to come to terms that Trump is the caricature of what stupid people see when they see an actual wise leader, an Obama, a Biden, a Booker. They see no difference between the two. Machiavelli warned us of this.   This level of stupidity is the consequence of many government, personal, and religious decisions throughout many decades, with proper civic and moral education standards being reduced and altogether removed.   Wisdom is constantly tested by reality, stupidity sooner or later fails that test. Wisdom and stupidity are directly opposed to each other, but the level of wisdom required to confidently recognize stupidity, enlightened wisdom, is hard to come by. Because:  > The trouble with the world is that the stupid are cocksure and the intelligent full of doubt.—Bertrand Russell",Edgar_Brown,2025-05-03T00:26:12,1

"Like I said, my discriminatory abilities are not what I'm worried about.  I had to listen to Fox News pretty much my entire childhood and even at age 13 it was pretty obvious that ""fair and balanced"" was only ever a suggestion—and that was when they actually had someone like Alan Colmes co-hosting in a prime time slot.  If you're expecting me to defend the ""liberal"" news stations, you'll be disappointed. First, those stations are more _neoliberal_ than anything—calling them ""left"" would be an insult to the Left. Second, I don't watch them because I don't consider them to be of any higher quality than Fox News.  One thing I will say for them, though: their viewers tend to have a better grip on reality than Fox viewers do.",Delta-9-,2025-05-07T23:42:45,1

I actually agree with you on regulating algorithms instead of speech. I think that simply banning algorithms might be a bit strong though. What if instead we measured the outcome:  if more than x% of messages promoted by the algorithm are anti social (or whatever) then the company gets fined.

"Well, they certainly are a major news source, I'll give you that. One might even call them ""mainstream media.""  That doesn't make them unbiased.
