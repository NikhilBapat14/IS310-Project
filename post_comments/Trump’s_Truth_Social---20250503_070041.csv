"He’s not here to govern. He’s not here to make the country better.   He’s here to stroke his ego and make himself unimaginably rich.   Once we accept that he doesn’t care at all about the country, or anyone in it, his actions actually make total sense.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-03T07:21:06,50

Difference is Democrats forced Biden to not run again. The Republicans just kiss his ass and “Yes Sir” him to death.,oldnjgal,2025-05-03T07:15:00,13

"I dip into Trump's account on TS since you don't need an account to view it.  I'd say his ""likes"" on there average around 30,000 which is just shy of 0.5% of the estimated 6.3 million users.    He's throwing red meat to the most rabid fans of MAGA,  literally the looniest of their fringe movement.  The rest of us see his posting as purely the raving of a lunatic.",Iowa_Dave,2025-05-03T08:10:28,12
"People forget that trump is the same age that Biden was when he got elected, Biden had a couple of gaffs at the start but nothing major.   Trump is showing a lot of the same signs, losing his train of thought, rambling about nonsense and whatnot.   Trumps cognitive decline may be even more visible then Joe Biden’s in the next few years because trump is unwilling to take a step beach from the cameras or not be the center of attention.",I_use_Reddit2,2025-05-03T08:14:24,11
He makes less sense than Biden did at the end...he's fucking nutters. He's just filling his pockets while letting the US burn.,HairyUnderwear,2025-05-03T07:04:17,16

Oh come on! Do you actually need some kind of expert opinion about Trump's mental health?     He obviously has less mental capacity than a bag of popcorn.  Why bother to even ask the question?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T14:09:47,2
He’s just another “elected” official put there by the super rich and powerful. He’s not the first but by far the most brazen of them all. Buckle up because it’s barely even started.,fingerscrossed31,2025-05-03T08:33:51,3
