">The decision comes in the case of Community Legal Service in East Palo Alto v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. According to the plaintiffs’ complaint, filed on March 26 in federal court in northern California, the agency, led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with the department’s Office of Refugee Resettlement and the U.S. Department of the Interior, cut funding for attorneys representing unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings.  RFK Jr being straight up evil about kids with no parents.  >The complaint alleges that the funding cuts violate a 2008 statute called the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), in which Congress mandated that the government “‘ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,’ that all unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent them in ‘legal proceedings’ and to ‘protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.'”  Where the fuck are the Q-whisperers now?",Sachyriel,2025-04-25T14:18:51,7
