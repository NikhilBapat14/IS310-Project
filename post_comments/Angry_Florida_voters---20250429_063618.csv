"**TL;DR**: Angry voters are holding ""empty chair"" town halls as GOP lawmakers avoid public meetings. Republicans, advised against in-person events after viral confrontations, face backlash over federal cuts and Trump policies. Protesters disrupted Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s event; others booed GOP members. In Florida, Rep. Kat Cammack, avoiding town halls since 2021, was criticized at symbolic gatherings where constituents voiced concerns about Social Security, research funding, and farm aid. Cammack dismissed the events as ""performative.""",pharrt,2025-04-29T06:38:47,323

Please don’t lump South Georgia with North Florida . I live in South GA in a blue county . I’m surrounded by several tiny red counties of inbred hicks  .

Kemp is a piece of shit and I can’t wait to see him gone but even so he is nowhere close to being as bad as Desantis but I also bet he would have told Trump to fuck if he talked about his wife instead of asking for more like kemp .

"You're creating straw men instead of engaging with what I actually said. Your comparison to Nazi sympathizers remains offensive and inappropriate regardless of how you try to qualify it.  When I mentioned pregnancy, I was acknowledging that different people have different priorities based on their circumstances - that's called empathy, not a lack of it. I recognize that reproductive rights would be a more pressing factor for someone who could become pregnant.  I never said I 'only' choose battles that affect me directly. I said I consider where government impacts my life when making living decisions - which is what everyone does to varying degrees. You've twisted this into an extreme caricature that I 'only care when it affects me' and have 'no empathy for others.'  Most people make these kinds of practical trade-offs every day. We choose where to live based on affordability, climate, job opportunities, and proximity to family - not just who the governor is. Your argument essentially demands ideological purity at the expense of personal wellbeing, which isn't sustainable or realistic for most people.  The irony is that by moving somewhere affordable where I can thrive, I'm actually in a better position to support causes I care about than if I were struggling financially in a 'politically perfect' location.

I didn't twist anything because ""you look at where government directly impacts your life and choose to vote accordingly"" and ""If I could be a woman that could be pregnant, well that would be a completely different topic."" Just because you are not a woman doesn't mean the issues they are facing aren't present or any less important. Of course you should put value in your life and not make sacrifices detrimental to your well being, but only taking action when it directly affects YOUR life, is the same as lacking empathy for others because their lives are being affected.  I'm just calling you out on your action of indifference for others. I am not demanding anything about ideological purity and speaking in absolutes of ""either you're with me or against me."" I don't have this inflated level of moral superiority and have a need for people to think exactly as me. However I do feel the need to hold those accountable when their indifference affects others. You made the comment, I replied to it. I'm attacking your actions or rather inaction to do something unless it affects your life, and if you feel it's attacking your character then maybe you're starting to understand my point.

Voting, donating, volunteering, and advocacy can happen anywhere - they don't require living in a high-cost state with ideologically aligned leadership.
