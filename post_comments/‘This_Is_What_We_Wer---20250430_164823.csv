"This article is quite revealing, in the sense that it accidentally highlights one of the differences between American society and those of the EU, Canada, AUS / NZ etc.    “Even so, the creation of a huge government database of personal information about U.S. residents is dangerous and very likely against the law”  Most EU countries have versions of this because of our tax and social welfare systems. Properly and ethically managed it’s not a problem. The fact that Americans are instinctively suspicious of such a thing comes (ironically) from the same place that causes them to embrace the 2nd Amendment and obsess about liberty etc to the point of voting themselves into authoritarianism. lol.",BadgersFannyBatter,2025-04-30T17:03:31,-1
