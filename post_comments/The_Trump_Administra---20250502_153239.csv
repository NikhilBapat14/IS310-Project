It‚Äôs easy to make up conspiracies about something you can‚Äôt see with your own two eyes. But money is something tangible and can mean a lot to Americans. It‚Äôs also hard to ignore that the tariffs are in fact the source of the economic woes in rural America. Farmers check crop prices every day and they know who they‚Äôre selling to. They are well aware how much they sell to China. They also rely on government subsidies and welfare programs which are being gutted. This is going to compound the problems brought on by the loss of economic prosperity.
