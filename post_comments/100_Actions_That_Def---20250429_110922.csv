Attempts to repeal birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the Constitution, by executive order. The move inspires a wave of lawsuits and is blocked by several federal judges. The Supreme Court is set to take up the issue in May.  I just want to clarify that the Supreme Court isn’t considering repealing birthright citizenship. It is considering limiting the power of federal district court judges to issue nationwide injunctions.   Disallowing nationwide injunctions could drastically hobble court efforts to stop the Trump administration’s illegal actions, including refusing to recognize birthright citizenship. The administration argues every single person affected by such actions must file separate lawsuits in order to stop the actions.",wjbc,2025-04-29T11:15:47,3
"***From Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson and Ryan Bort:***  Donald Trump’s first 100 days have been the most chaotic and consequential in modern political memory. He has wielded the presidency like a king, seeking to bend America (and, far less successfully, the world) to his will. The result has been about what you’d expect from the first convicted felon and twice-impeached insurrectionist to return to the White House: a reckless campaign of overreach and lawlessness that has strained the federal judiciary, the Constitution, and American democracy itself.  Trump has emerged with few legislative accomplishments — the fewest in a president’s first 100 days, in fact, since the 1950s. They include a short-term spending bill and a law named for muder victim Laken Riley that strips immigrants of due-process rights — both enabled by Democrats. But as he’s taken a hatchet to the government, empowering Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and Trump’s largest political benefactor, to decimate the federal bureaucracy, eliminating entire agencies, slashing and demoralizing others, while hoovering up Americans’ personal data for as yet unclear (but surely not benign) purposes.  Trump’s 100 days are consequential, but not politically successful. At the 100 day mark he’s the least popular president in some 80 years. His chaotic and nasty style of governance has sent his approvals into the toilet. He now finds himself under water even on his signature issue immigration. Trump has spent the days leading up to the milestone melting down over his polling.  It hasn’t been all bad, though. He did move to get rid of the penny.  Here we survey 100 of the most terrifying, corrupt, and otherwise absurd actions that Trump and his administration have taken since he was inaugurated on Jan. 20.
