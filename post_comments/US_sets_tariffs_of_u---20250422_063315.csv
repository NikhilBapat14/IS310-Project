"If US needs to tax a ridiculous 3,521% tariff just to be competitive with Asian companies, then US solar industry is already dead.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-22T06:39:34,37
The ironic part is some in gop were ridiculing biden’s policies to tax china parts to favor USA production saying it was hypocrisy if wanting to go green.  Well now trump cancels american funding and taxes to the moon imports so we cannot have competitive solar. Every policy is to weaken USA with fake bravado.   This is dumb.,oroechimaru,2025-04-22T06:59:31,8

"This is technically called adcvd in the industry, not tariffs as we know them today. It stands for antidumping counter vailing duties. These assigned rates are company specific, not country of origin.    This investigation was a multi year effort started in the biden administration. The rate is based upon the quantity and price of cheap, unfairly priced solar panels being sent to the usa by individual companies. One company was hit at +3000%, some at 50%.    Most foreign solar panel companies are not affected by this, just the bad ones. This is the correct way to have a trade war. Punish the bad companies,  not the entire  country.",DrJJStroganoff,2025-04-22T08:26:01,6

"I had seen this reference earlier and thought it was a joke. You would think that if you need a 1,000% plus tariff it is a bit of a clue that this industry is not one in which you have a comparative advantage. Barring any national security, you shouldn't focus on this. Or is this just an attempt to trash green industries?",kookiemaster,2025-04-22T07:45:49,1

"This technically is called ""anti dumping / countervailing"" in the industry. Only select companies that are selling product at clearly unfair prices are targeted, and they each have their own percentage rate.  This was a multi year investigation that started in the biden administration. They followed Chinese companies that were exporting cheap parts to other countries to avoid having a country of origin ""china"" on their finished good and be subject to higher tariffs.  Edit: downvoted for being right? Read the article, it's company specific, and not country or even product specific.  Only the bad companies are having these adcvd rates put on their products.",DrJJStroganoff,2025-04-22T08:17:04,1
"This review of solar panels was started under the biden administration to help protect us solar panel companies.

">Unless you are a China supporter, I suppose.  Was it your intention to say something so loaded, or was this sarcasm? Because for the domestic solar industry, this is an absolute disaster. I know plenty of people in solar or who own solar and they’re going to go out of business because our solar supply chains rely on Chinese industry, and our industry isn’t nearly as mature or as advanced as the Chinese’s.   We don’t have the funding to advance the tech here either, nor the institutional willpower to not take any funding handed off to private interests and turn that into stock buybacks.   This is a disaster because China is the global leader in green energy.",Mofo_mango,2025-04-22T07:36:52,3
