"Pretend you want to start a business. Obviously if you want to grow it, you need to hire other people. If there are no unemployed people, then your only option to hire is to ""take/steal"" an employee from someone else. In order to do so, you offer that employee more money than they were currently making (for example, if they were making $15/hour, you offer them $17/hour). Once that employee leaves, that employer is in the same boat and must steal a different employee. So the low unemployment has two significant impacts from this perspective; that there aren't enough employees to grow your economy, and wages will have to rise quickly as employees jump from business to business.   Generally, a national unemployment rate of ~4-5% is great. When it drops below 4%, you start having issues finding workers, meaning the economy can't grow as quickly as it wants.",ProLifePanda,2022-11-13T08:28:01,2
Employment that's too low means there's basically nobody changing jobs at all. That's not good. It means employers can't find new employees. It means employees aren't finding better jobs. An effective economy needs a certain amount of creative destruction and when everyone is doing the same thing they have been doing then that's not happening.,mormagils,2022-11-14T09:35:23,1
