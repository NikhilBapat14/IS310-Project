Wait till it hits Walmart. The Walton family has been quiet as church mice lately...,williamgman,2025-04-27T17:07:42,23
"Yeah, those aren’t the prices that are going to hit people hard.  There are real imports, that we are used to buying cheaply* that will have a far greater effect.  So don’t pretend it is fast fashion and plastic Christmas ornaments, that is a big concern.  * Without executive branch extortion that puts the burden on anyone but the already wealthy.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T16:43:52,16

"Yup with a caveat.  Will they find a domestic alternative that also doesn't increase?  I'm not judging, I have my indulgent expenditures I know I should cut... but it'll be a wake up call for many of 'hey, I really didn't need that shit'",nerphurp,2025-04-27T17:00:24,3
And trump gets your tariff money to corruptly spend on himself.,netsheriff,2025-04-27T18:32:42,1
"For a lot of my hobbies (which have me buying from aliexpress, etc) there are no domestic alternatives.",FlyingRock,2025-04-27T17:50:51,13
Shoot all my hobbies are manufactured elsewhere. And to me there is no reason to manufacture them here. Why on earth would you manufacture something so niche to a small audience when other countries refuse to import the same item because of reckless shit head leadership?,Hes_gonna_drop_that,2025-04-27T21:04:46,1
