"Never give Jones credit. He's a frothing at the mouth idiot, but he knows what he's doing. This will get him a round of comparatively good press and people going ""even Alex Jones says [this basic-ass take everyone already said]!"" That's what he wants. He does it every 6 months or so for something, and there's always a string attached. If you're a sane person, you're never actually agreeing with Alex Jones even if it appears you're standing in the same place.  He's always working an angle, he always lies.  For example, not too long after the Oct 7th attacks, he got a round of this ""even Alex Jones is saying!"" press because without context and following the depth of what stupid shit he's actually saying, it sort of looked like he was saying Israel should exercise more caution when bombing in Gaza. But what he was *actually saying* was ""Israel should exercise more caution when bombing in Gaza... **because** the globalists, the evil Democrats, and the World Economic Forum are working together to import every military aged male in Gaza into America as refugees, and then will give them all guns and have them patrol polling places and steal the election.""  This is why it's never worth it to go ""even Alex Jones says!"" There's always a string attached. And it's not as if he's ever giving a take so unique and incisive that we have no choice to highlight his great words. The words he is saying are only noteworthy because he is saying them and is such a ghoul.",SadFeed63,2025-05-08T13:02:12,162

See they know Pam Bondi is stalling with the documents. Good.  The problem is they lack the mental capacity to keep the thought process going.  Why. WHY is Pam Bondi stalling. It’s widely known his candidates wouldn’t do anything without his say so. So why is she stalling.   Because shes been instructed to stall while they are cleaned up of certain information.   Then the next logical step would be why is trump reluctant to have the information broadcast.  I know we all know all of this. It would be almost encouraging to learn that maga is getting mad.

"Like I said I’m definitely speaking in general terms, but you’re right on the first part    But the second part is just bullshit man….if Trump hadn’t ran for another term, this wouldn’t be talked about at all. The same way it wasn’t talked about two years ago, or three years ago when it just wasn’t as politically valuable to talk about. Nothing changed for the victims, it just became more viable as a political weapon as the election approached   And sure, I think everyone on the left would be willing to shoot Clinton in the back of the head to get Trump out of office, but that doesn’t make it not political, or mean they somehow give more of a shit about the victims.   Like…idk dude just be real with me. On some level you know what I’m saying is true.   It’s not hard to tell. The discussion surrounding this topic on Reddit isn’t some well-researched fact-based dialogue, it’s rife with misinformation and oftentimes borders on Qanon levels of insanity.

"I think the ""online left's"" interest in this story is more a response to how the ""online right"" has tried to use it to bludgeon the left with it in fits and starts every x years.    It's not the ""left"" or the Biden administration that was staging Epstein influencer reveal parties with their favorite Twitter and Youtube personalities, and it's wasn't the ""online left"" that is still clamoring for ""the Epstein Files' to be released in some sort of showy fashion to splash across their channels for perceived political points.   What the online left IS befuddled about is how the ""online right"" can be so convinced that this is the story of the century while totally oblivious to Trump's well-documented entanglements with Epstein, and they are just gobsmacked that the ""online right"" wants to hammer leftie pols with Epstein innuendo while handwaving away Trump's own connections.  Listen, I'm not gonna sit here and tell you that justice for Jeffery Epstein  victims and prosecution for Epstein cronies more the good of mankind has been a core principle of the left for decades - it clearly hasn't.  That said, the ""left"" has done what they do - they work appropriately to prosecute people that deserve prosecution.  Are the left above petty political slander?  Fuck no.  But they also don't shut their eyes and cover their ears when one of their own is absolute scum, generally speaking.      Anyway, bottom line-  I'm just not going to agree when you try and tell me that the right isn't exploiting this whole thing WAY more than the left ever has.   There are a few things I think are true:  1) Some High-ranking pols in both parties would suffer in an honest, thorough examination of the Epstein client list.  2) Innocent victims would be revealed  3) The full files will not ever be released because DJT is all. over. them.  4) There are some hardcore MAGA media types that honestly believe that all Dems are pedos, and the Epstein files are full of mainly Dem names.  They are wrong.  4a) Bondi has seen the files and knows that the facts are significantly different (and likely would harm Trump)  AND/OR 4b) Feds at SDNY are pros and have no desire to contribute to a political circus and have probably warned her that she would open a can of worms that she wants no part of .",IAmTheGeezer,2025-05-08T18:10:21,5

"100% with you up until here and below   >Anyway, bottom line-  I'm just not going to agree when you try and tell me that the right isn't exploiting this whole thing WAY more than the left ever has.  The right has been doing it for longer, and are definitely more transparent in their hypocrisy, but the left has been catching up at an astonishing pace   As for your numbered points:  1) I actually don’t believe this to be true. I spent a long time believing this, but have reached the point where I’m relatively confident that Epstein and Maxwell acted alone. I’m surprised that more people don’t feel this way, but they’ve been hit with a lot of misinformation, and are more than happy to use the story as a political weapon   2) agreed there   3) I don’t think there is a whole lot to be released. The vast majority were released by the courts already. Some presumably are still under seal, but those could only be unsealed by the judge who sealed them. There could be classified documents stemming from an investigation from the FBI that a president could declassify (I think). However,  seeing as they haven’t led to any arrests, one would hope that means they’re either part of an ongoing investigation, or only involved Epstein, and declassifying would only serve to reveal details about his victims. If you’ve ever wondered why Biden didn’t just release some files, there’s your likely answer  As for the rest, and Trump being all over the files, it’s doubtful imo. Firstly, because as I said, I think Epstein acted alone. But also because the allegations against Trump with regards to Epstein are rather weak. Katie Johnson is the major one, but her allegations have some major credibility issues, to the point where it’s unclear if she actually exists. And then there’s Sarah Ransome who is…a bit kooky, to put it politely  Beyond that, their relationship looks kind of like what you would expect two rich guys living down the street from one another to be.   Knew each other for 15-20 years. During that time, Trump flew on Epstein’s plane 7 times, and I believe the 4 times in 1993 were when Trump’s own plane was being refurbished. There are, I think, 6 photographs of them together and the one video from, four or five different nights (again, over the course of 15-20 years).

I hope we can agree though that, at least as of today, it's mainly the online MAGA wing that are still trying make this a Very Big Deal, and I'll happily concede that if somehow Trump were found to be a critical part of whatever documents are eventually revealed, the left will be ranting about it for decades :)",IAmTheGeezer,2025-05-08T18:52:10,1
