Let's do the opposite.  No external funding for campaigns or for commercials.,mysticrhythms,2025-05-09T19:17:37,100
We need to get billionaire money out of politics and fund it all thru Congress.  The rich must stop buying America and the presidency and the nation's wealth.,crosstheroom,2025-05-09T19:16:39,46
May Congress suffer under the weight of the cash they take from billionaires.,disasterbot,2025-05-09T19:13:44,20
It's much more important to get big money out of politics. Repeal Citizens United.,BukkitCrab,2025-05-09T19:43:53,19
"We should eliminate businesses funding presidential campaigns entirely. A business is not a person. A business cannot do anything that the *people* running that business don't want. That business, as an entity, has no right to anything beyond what the *people* extend to it. A business cannot sign a contract; the *people* representing it do. The business itself has no vote for the people on its board, and therefore should have no vote for a politician, monetarily or otherwise.   Then, tie the maximum annual contribution to the hourly minimum wage. 500x the hourly minimum wage makes it $3,650 annually, which is $150 more than it is currently. Want more? Raise the minimum wage. That's the gist of what I would introduce.",DownwardSpirals,2025-05-09T20:20:47,11
"Lol not like they don't take bribes anyways and private funding has always been a thing.  Now they just made it more obvious.  ""Hey guys fuck you cause now billionaires fund us and we could care less about you."" Something like that.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T19:27:39,9
"Step One: Eliminate federal funding for presidential campaigns.   Step Two: Eliminate all anti-corruption safeguards limiting or banning presidential campaign contributions from other sources, foreign govts etc. Make these rules retroactive.   Step Three: Profit and revel in your scam and morning so well.",Limberine,2025-05-09T21:09:07,6
This is performative.  He’s not actually expecting this to pass.,cheekmo_52,2025-05-09T20:14:22,6
"Uh. Yeah, this hasn’t even been used in 20 years. We probably should enforce only public finance for presidential elections, but it won’t happen.",Randy_Watson,2025-05-09T22:04:12,3
feel free to cross post this over at r/BillSentinel      We try to cover as much of the most important legislative action as possible to show precisely how the machinery is working.,vucubcame,2025-05-09T19:57:56,2
Of course it’s a Florida republican,Pankosmanko,2025-05-10T16:56:05,1
Please and thank you,clovisx,2025-05-09T20:13:23,13
For all political races. Get money out of politics.,runnerofshadows,2025-05-09T22:01:42,8
I'm old enough to remember when it was a point to state that the campaigns took no private money.   There's a reason that they have that checkbox on the 1040 for the Presidential campaign fund.,jcdick1,2025-05-10T01:16:45,4
I might pass because it's awful and will do more damage to our democracy.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-09T20:40:02,4
"It isn’t in congress’ best interest to pass this legislation.  If the sitting president loses those funds for their campaign, the onus falls on congress to fundraise more than they already do to make up the shortage.  The average senator and congressperson doesn’t want to spend more time fundraising, regardless of party.  I don’t see this gaining much traction.",cheekmo_52,2025-05-10T01:07:48,2
