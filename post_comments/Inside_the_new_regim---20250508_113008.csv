"> That was echoed by former Republican congressman Joe Walsh, who regularly speaks out about this. “If there’s not room for center-right former Republicans in today’s Democratic Party, then today’s Republican Party will remain victorious and our democracy will disappear,” Walsh told me.  What reality has he been living in? The last two cycles featured Republicans campaigning for the Democratic nominee, including Republican speakers at the DNC. A year ago Democrats supported an immigration bill that matched what Republicans were asking for 10-20 years ago. It is incredibly disingenuous to insist that Democrats “meet you in the middle” while Republicans keep moving to the right.",dannyb_prodigy,2025-05-08T12:29:53,434

And now, they want to simply shift to the Democrat side and do it all over again.  I say no. These people need to fall with MAGA and be politically burnt. The cost of the destruction of America needs to be pinned on all of them forever. That is the foundation of building a better society. America will be taken over completely by MAGA and burnt to the ground or all of the supporters will be exorcized from politics.  Installing a criminal in the White House is too great a sin to allow a simple side-step. Also, allowing them would transform the Democrats into the Republicans of the past and start the whole process again.

But i do also believe that there are still some people there that would jump ship IF they could still retain their power to get away from the maga shit for something resembling common sense governing.  not many but at least some.  the problem with the concept here is that there are so few that they would never split off because they would thus be surrounded by democrats more left than they are.  they wouldnt agree with most of the left of center viewpoint.  and there wouldnt be enough of them to likely make a dent in policy.   That said, the only reason i want this, and its not to vote for those positions, its so it could take away the possibility of maga retaining majority.  if there were 3 powers rather than 2 and all 3 were roughly equal in strength, then to pass anything, you would need to negotiate.  this is the core principle that i want to see.  not this bs where 1 side or the other gets total power and reigns unchecked.  there is plenty of evidence right in front of us now that there are incumbent dems who refuse to change their ways or work with new progressives.  this in the end is just as damning for good change to happen. and its a big part of the problem with the democrats right now.",VOIDsama,2025-05-08T21:49:59,1

"I don’t think that’s a good take. I’m a pretty left-leaning Canadian, and I don’t blame most Americans for this. I think that if we want to stop this decay from spreading further, we need to make an effort to understand how it got to this point.  I think there is a huge list of potential reasons that lead Americans to disengage with the political process, or push people towards voting against their own self-interest:  · Extreme gerrymandering that makes many feel like their voices will not be heard, so why bother?  · Voter suppression by removing people from voter rolls, adding more restrictions to voting, some communities purposefully having very few polling stations which means a \*very\* long wait for some individuals.  · Chronic underfunding of education nationwide – especially in poorer/rural states – which ensures large swaths of people are easier to manipulate. The average American reads at around a 6^(th) grade level… think of how many people fall under that bar. There’s a reason Trump said “I love the poorly educated.”  · The purposeful coupling of right-wing talking points/rhetoric with religion/faith in many churches and communities. I’m not religious, but understand that faith and the judgment of local religious leaders can impact rural communities.  · Decades of propaganda pushing people further and further right. Plus, while America might be an extremely wealthy nation, a lot of the heavy lifting is being carried by the wealthiest. The poorest Americans are probably worse off than those of most other First World countries since the safety net is almost non-existent. Plus, non-insignificant portions of the country don’t have access to good internet, or even alternative news sources to Fox News or right-wing radio.  · Adding to the last point… for people who are in lower income brackets, if life is so hard, why do they care who is in power? I’m sure many are struggling so much that it feels like neither party has done anything for them, and the whole system could probably burn for all they care. You and I may both know that’s not necessarily true, but if you mix in some of the other above points, the cognitive dissonance is easier to achieve (eg. Obamacare bad, ACA/Medicare good).  I’m sure I’m missing a bunch of different points as well.  I absolutely understand your anger and frustration, but I think that attitude is exactly what causes many people to double down on their own ignorance.

"Ok. I don’t live in a swing state. I voted, and my vote had zero material impact on the national election. If my neighbor chose not to vote, are they really responsible in any way more than me for trump because they didn’t vote in the national election?   Voting is great. That’s why it’s important for state governments and election boards to expand access to it. I find that to be much more compelling than asking why millions of people don’t take potentially hours out of their workday that they can’t afford, in order to participate in a system that they feel doesn’t work.  If personal responsibility was all it took to get people to the polls, then maybe you’d expect to see swing states have the highest turnouts. However, the 10 states with the highest turnouts last cycle only a single one was a swing state. What they all share are practices like automatic voter registration, or mail in voting, etc etc.  Does getting that one guy to vote matter more than changing the system to enable more than a few million people in swing states to actually have a meaningful vote?

"I think it's just intellectually dishonest to blame the loss on the folks who wouldn't vote for her because of her race and gender. Don't get me wrong, theres obviously a non-zero population of people who voted that way, but Like someone else said, we've elected a black president and Hillary had better numbers in 2016. It's just a convenient excuse so they can say ""hey, we ran a perfect campaign. It's the voters who are wrong.""   I think what happened was that there was a disinformation campaign trying to get leftwing voters to not vote at all by painting apathy as a moral choice against genocide. ""Don't vote, and your hands won't be covered in blood!"" Millions of folks sat this one out because of misinformation on israel/palestine and the role of the US in a Kamala/trump presidency.   If Kamala had shut that shit down harder and hardlined a stance on the conflict she probably would've turned out more voters in swing states.",x1000Bums,2025-05-08T15:08:17,1
"Glad there's a few Americans who tried to steer the course, regardless of the outcome. In our election in Canada recently, although I didn't have to wait in line on Election Day, I did have to walk quite a bit in pouring rain. Elections aren't always convenient, but it's a civic duty to vote. Hearing excuses on why people don't vote doesn't sit well with me.

"I think that the biggest challenge is that we don't have a shared culture. We can't even communicate about problems because we don't have a shared language we can use to discuss and solution them.  Moreover, people on the left typically have vastly different value systems than people on the right. It's not just about what we care about, it's that our value systems lead us to see completely different things as problems. Like, we can't fundamentally look at a scenario and independently come to the same conclusion about what needs to be improved, because we don't value the same things.  Logically, no one can get everything they want. But there are non negotiable things that the majority should in theory agree on... But our culture is so frayed that we don't even all agree on whether the rights granted to us by the constitution itself are ""constitutional"".  How can you solve a problem if you don't agree on the definition of the problem itself? That's step 1 of problem solving...  I threw this thread into chatGPT and it had some pretty eye opening insights. I thought y'all might find this good food for thought like I did. Those causal thread data points really hit me hard ngl. 😢   ---   Below is a compact “root-cause map” that teases out the main causal threads behind the exchange between Person 1 (blaming apathy) and Person 2 (defending over-stretched voters).  ---  ## 1  Observed surface claims | Speaker | Key assertions | |---------|----------------| | **Person 1** | • U.S. election was *authoritarian vs democracy* and most Americans were indifferent.<br>• “Not caring” = voting against democracy.<br>• Only ~⅓ support liberal democracy; > 40 % approve of Trump today. | | **Person 2** | • Most Americans are exhausted, under-paid, and too busy to follow politics.<br>• Political news feels uniformly bad, so they tune out. |  ---  ## 2  Core pain-points raised by the dialogue 1. **Time cost of being informed**   2. **Energy / cognitive load**   3. **“It’s all bad anyway” cynicism**    ---  ## 3  Causal threads (Five-Why style)  | Pain-point | Chain of “why’s” | Representative data | |------------|------------------|---------------------| | **A. Time poverty** | (i) Long hours + multiple jobs → little discretionary time → (ii) news consumption must compete with childcare, side-gigs, sleep → (iii) politics seen as low-ROI activity | 42 % of lower-income adults say they “never” have free time to follow politics  | | **B. Energy depletion / burnout** | (i) Chronic economic stress → mental bandwidth taxed → (ii) complex politics feels overwhelming → (iii) people protect scarce attention by disengaging | Majorities who *do* follow campaigns already feel “worn out” 18 months before Election Day  | | **C. Negativity & helplessness** | (i) Media incentives amplify outrage & conflict → (ii) salience of scandals, gridlock, corruption → (iii) heuristic: “it’s all bad, nothing changes” → (iv) learned helplessness reduces turnout & civic talk | 64 % say they see inaccurate election news at least “somewhat often,” half find it hard to tell truth from fiction  | | **D. Information overload & mistrust** | (i) Fragmented media + disinformation → (ii) effort to verify skyrockets → (iii) skepticism toward all institutions (“both sides lie”) → (iv) disengagement appears rational | Only 20 % trust the federal government to do what is right “most of the time”; declining trust itself viewed as a top problem  | | **E. Social proof of apathy** | (i) In many peer groups, *not* following politics is the norm → (ii) social cost to staying informed > benefit → (iii) apathy perpetuates apathy | Pew’s “Tuning Out” cluster (17 % of U.S. adults) seldom discuss politics even with friends/family  | | **F. Approval-rating perception gap** | Person 1 cites ~40 % Trump approval → (i) reinforces belief that authoritarianism is mainstream → (ii) fuels anger at apathetic peers; but (iii) approval is a minority, not a majority (April 2025 Gallup: 44 %)  |  ---  ## 4  Inter-thread feedback loops * **Resource spiral** – Time poverty (A) ⇄ Energy depletion (B). Less time → more exhaustion → less bandwidth.   * **Trust spiral** – Mistrust (D) ⇄ Negativity (C). Low trust makes negative stories more compelling, reinforcing mistrust.   * **Social spiral** – Social proof of apathy (E) normalizes disengagement, which further erodes collective knowledge and trust.    ---  ## 5  Why Person 1 vs Person 2 talk past each other * **Different problem framing** – Person 1 sees a *values* failure (“you chose authoritarianism”); Person 2 sees a *capacity* failure (“people are maxed out”).   * **Moral attribution error** – Each attributes the other side’s stance to character (laziness vs malice) rather than structural constraints.   * **Data cherry-picking** – Person 1 uses a single polling figure to claim a “big majority,” ignoring that 44 % ≠ majority and that approval ≠ pro-authoritarian.    ---  ## 6  Potential leverage points (if you want to explore solutions) 1. **Lower the cost curve** – Curated, bias-transparent news digests that can be consumed in < 10 min/day.   2. **Recharge, don’t drain** – “Explainer-first” journalism that focuses on pathways to act, not just problems.   3. **Social tipping** – Community challenges or micro-pledges (“bring one friend to vote”) to flip social proof of apathy.   4. **Trust scaffolds** – Shared-source fact-checking hubs that let busy citizens “rent” trust from known validators.",panormda,2025-05-08T17:32:03,1

"You may be right. I just think that there’s enough of those other compounding elements (because there’s always a percentage that feel one or more of those prejudices, even if it’s not a consciously recognized decision) that it takes that slight edge away and is enough of an erosion that makes it that much harder for a woman to be elected in a nationwide race.   But yeah, the propaganda and misinformation campaign has grown especially strong in the social media age. There’s also been a decline in quality education combined with what seems to be a youth demographic with a bit of apathy towards their own education.

Actually, I'm curious to know what you think is really feeding into the main challenges folks have. Like, do you think that if there were a super simple way to get the facts they needed without having to invest much time or energy, would people engage with it? Or do you think that even if such a perfect solution existed, they are just not mentally able to engage with it at all?
