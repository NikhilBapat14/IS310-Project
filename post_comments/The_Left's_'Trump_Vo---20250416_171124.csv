"The left's understanding of the right ***does not come from observing the right***, it comes from listening to a series of leftist opinion panels ***bitching about the right.***  The latest greatest hoax was just too stupid to take seriously - they're not actually trying anymore they're just going through the motions to get their paychecks.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T17:20:23,213
No actual real Trump voter thinks we would be better off with the doofus Kamala Harris.  None. Zip. Zero. ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-16T17:14:14,221
Everything CNN reports is fabricated and exaggerated. Did anyone see the documentary that just came out (i think it was just released) that tried to prove that all domestic terrorism was from the far right or conservative groups?,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-16T17:16:13,67

"I don't like several things Trump has done, but isn't that about having a robust party that can question what their own side is doing?  Democrats are confused because they only have their one approved voice.  Dissent is not allowed or you become Tulsi/RFK and multiple others.",LDL2,2025-04-17T06:01:06,9
Can Clown News Network lie it’s way out of this if their own guy said it?,melie776,2025-04-16T20:41:50,14
The left is so desperate to be relevant about something. They so wish we hated Trump like they do.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-16T19:13:59,26
"The left has gotten absolutely *bizarre*.  I mean wow, they’ve jumped the shark and landed inthe tank of unicorn sharks that eat cotton candy and fart rainbows.    Trying to Gaslight those of us who voted for Trump and MAGA, get real!  We aren’t feeling regret, if anything we’re pissed off congress isn’t doing a stellar job at supporting Trump, and pissed that activist judges are slowing down perfectly legal actions.  We want **more** Trump, not less - you lefty weirdos.    are you regretting it yet?    nope    Ok, how about NOW?   Still a big no.     Ok, it’s been a day.  Feeling regret?! NO!  ITS BEEN A WEEK!  ADMIT IT!  YOU REGRET VOTING FOR TRUMP!  NO YA DINGUS! WTF is WRONG WIH YOU?!!!",cliffotn,2025-04-16T17:48:38,122

Obviously most people with power would be against the right wing that wants them to have less economic power.,kaytin911,2025-04-17T15:07:54,0
