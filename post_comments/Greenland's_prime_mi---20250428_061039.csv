I still haven't seen a valid reason on why we should acquire Greenland. What if they vote themselves to become a state and now there's an extra liberal state and 2 extra liberal senators? Makes no sense,specter491,2025-04-28T07:28:36,532

"Was the US being disrespectful when it inquired about purchasing Alaska? IMO making up that the US is being ""disrespectful"" when it's not is actually what is disrespectful.

Greenland is important for minerals. These minerals make micro chips most micro chips are made overseas aka Taiwan etc. Now they are being developed in the US. We still need these valuable minerals. China at any time can shut off those minerals to us. We want to be independent. We started off with 13 colonies and now have 50 states and territories. People act like we can never annex or purchase land. It’s happened time and time again throughout history.

Well not a state but they could be a territory   Greenland could vote to leave Denmark today and a similar vote to request to join the USA which would be accepted.  I originally thought that a offer of 1 mil per s person would sway that vote easily.  Seems like there is a lot of pushback now and it likely wouldn't work.,RoostasTowel,2025-04-28T13:46:03,-5

Denmark does have some say, but the issue of it not being bought is because the people there want nothing to do with being a part of the US.    >Why don't we test that theory and see who is full of shit?  How about we don't make every possible effort to alienate our allies and friends by harming them, and instead get 95% of what we want from Greenland for fucking free because they've done whatever we've asked in the past?

If this is how your friends react to things that are this benign then it means they were never really your friends to begin with. What you are doing is gaslighting because anyone with half a brain can see for themselves objectively that these countries hated the united states already and that coincided with their shift to left wing postmodernist political ideology - the US is hated because it's successful. What these people do is spin anything they can to smear the US then blame the victim to promote more hatred. It's a common tactic of these types of people.  You also didn't have any valid response to my questions. You claim the people there want nothing to do with being part of the US but you don't actually know that. You are just repeating media propaganda. Please show me the sufficient poll or referendum that poses the question to the public and tells us what their price is. This article says the price is infinity where is the evidence? You have none. You just don't like it. Asking people what they want and proposing to negotiate is not disrespectful no matter how much you want to lie and pretend that it is.  > 95% of what we want from Greenland for fucking free  This is news to me that Greenland already gives us 95% of their resources for free. Or maybe like I suspected your side here is full of shit.  > I swear its like people want China to be dominant.  Bingo.

"> If this is how your friends react to things that are this benign  Most countries would not consider taking territory that produces money away from them as benign.    >nyone with half a brain can see for themselves objectively that these countries hated the united states   They really don't. They buy our goods, join us in our wars, lap up our culture, and take their vacations here.  That's not hate dude.  > You claim the people there want nothing to do with being part of the US but you don't actually know that. You are just repeating media propaganda. Please show me the sufficient poll or referendum that poses the question to the public and tells us what their price is.  I'm going to wager that you won't accept any poll that I offer.  But in good faith, here is one:  [85% want nothing to do with joining the US](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/85-of-greenlanders-do-not-want-to-join-us-says-new-poll)  More Greenlanders saw Trump's statements as a threat than an opportunity.  People don't respond well to threats.  And in case you aren't happy with that poll, there was technically another one in March - an election.  The party that won opposes joining the US.  > Asking people what they want and proposing to negotiate is not disrespectful  The want to be Greenlanders, not Americans.  >no matter how much you want to lie and pretend that it is.   lol being insulting is often easier than formulating an actual point.  >This is news to me that Greenland already gives us 95% of their resources for free. Or maybe like I suspected your side here is full of shit.  My side would be conservatism.  They trade with us whenever we ask.  They give us military bases whenever we ask.  I guess you're correct in one sense: resources that exist only in theory, in areas that aren't explored, without mines or even roads to exploit, are in fact not being traded to us, if they actually exist.  >Bingo. That is exactly what the so called allies of the US want and have wanted for a long time now. Wake up.  Ok, you've got to be a bot.  This is outright lunacy that rivals the best Chinese or Russian disinformation.  It is laughably false.  Denmark, Greenland, and the rest of the Europeans do not want China to be dominant.

"> Most countries would not consider taking territory that produces money away from them as benign.  Offering people a deal that they can accept or decline is not ""taking"" territory away. It's literally asking what the people want and letting them choose.  > They really don't.  It takes you two seconds to look up that for the last 25 years the US has had a negative net favorability rating among its closest so called ""allies"" populations (accept Israel where the US is actually loved, ironically it's the country the left hates the most). All you had to do is walk around Canada or Europe even a decade ago and talk about americans with people and you would see the total distain among their populations.  > 85% want nothing to do with joining the US  Yeah and Kamala was gonna win Iowa right? What a joke you quote such an obvious propaganda poll here. It asks nothing about the price too which is the entire point (and we know why they didn't ask that).  > there was technically another one in March - an election  An election is not the same thing at all. Which candidate wanted to consider a deal to join the US? None of them did so what's your option? The most pro-US candidate got second and was only 5% behind the guy who won. Elections require people to vote on thousands of issues at once. It's not a referendum on a specific issue. It's funny independence is such a major topic there why don't they have an actual referendum? Because they know the result won't fit the narrative. Politicians and elites never support joining another country because it means they lose their personal power and influence that they've built under the current status quo.  > lol being insulting is often easier than formulating an actual point  Accept I did formulate actual points, so that doesn't even make sense.  > My side would be conservatism  Funny how you ""conservatives"" are upvoted by democrats and say the same thing as democrats and link to democrat media and polls... Yes... I'm sure ""conservative"" is your side. I can't say it's the only thing you've proven to be delusional about. You are just factually incorrect about Greenland's resources and other benefits, as well as the level of US autonomy in the region.  > Denmark, Greenland, and the rest of the Europeans do not want China to be dominant  They don't want anyone to be dominant because they are postmodernists. They clearly do prefer China to the US and their politicians are in bed with China. It also just so happens to be exactly what their actions have supported and resulted in the real world over the last decade while they've propped up China at the expense of the United States. We also see it in their double standards - they get upset at the US for imposing a fraction of the tariffs that China imposes or that they themselves impose... and threaten to do more trade with China. Hmm interesting... but didn't you say they prefer the US to China? It doesn't sound like they're trying that hard not to push the US away. It's almost like they're looking for any excuse to do so actually.",day25,2025-04-29T03:56:50,-6
The gymnastics you need to do is pretty sad. Are you just going to keep living your whole life in denial? Any rational person could look at that and see it for what it is.
