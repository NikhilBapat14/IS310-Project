"what an intro....      ""No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a    playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned  the  phrase:  “The  first  thing  we  do,  let’s  kill  all  the  lawyers.”    WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,HENRY VI,PART 2, act  4,  sc.  2,  l.  75.   When  Shakespeare’s  character,  a rebel  leader  intent  on  becoming king, seeid. l. 74, hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of his plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding “\[a\]way with him,” referring to an educated clerk, who “can make obligations and write court hand,” id. l. 90, 106.  Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the path to more power.  SeeWalters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be “that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government”).""",nanopicofared,2025-05-02T17:44:50,718

"That’s a fair point.  Oddly, enough, one class that most effectively helped my writing was the logic of philosophy.

I mean, if you want a challenge in language, philosophy seems, to me, like a rich field for study. Those bastards had no chill.

"I voted for Harris.  That doesn't mean it isn't a bad look for Emhoff's firm to \*preemptively\* pay a $100mill probono-work bribe to Trump instead of fighting this nonsense.  Emhoff's firm is being retaliated against because of their PRO BONO work defending the 2 Georgia poll workers, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, awarded $148million for defamation by Giuliani.  Yet they lack the testes to to fight Trump in court?  >The chair of the firm, Thomas M. Cerabino, said that ... \[he\] ""looks forward to having a constructive relationship with the Trump Administration.”  Please.  Emhoff is a vocal former 2nd Gentleman, married to a former California AG, US Senator, US VP, and US Presidential contender.  Can't get much more wrapped up in ""upper"" US Legal or Political ecospheres than that.  IT IS A BAD LOOK.  To his credit, Emhoff spoke out against his firm paying this bribe (even as a newbie to the firm):  >Emhoff \[said\] he had told the firm he wanted to fight the threat of an executive order he found unconstitutional but had been overruled.  Overruled?  So hasn't it occurred to EMHOFF that he may, perhaps, have deeper ethical disagreements with his new partners, and MAYBE he should try to do better than a firm that immediately rolls over to a vengeful FELON on legally untenable grounds?  Let's not pretend this capitulation to Trump DOES NOT impact his wife's professional future.  It does.  I don't have to spell it out.  Biden left on a sour note of ""Rules for thee but not for me"".  Remaining Dems are leaderless, viewed as feckless talkers, too scared to act or oppose a bunch of blundering criminals in the WH.  Nobody beats Trump-MAGA by yielding ground.  It just makes the beatings worse.  Trump's already bragging about these firms bowing to him like dogs.
