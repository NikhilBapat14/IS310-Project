"**Summary**: Elon Musk exemplifies ""pulling up the ladder""‚Äîhis companies (Tesla, SpaceX) thrived on $38B+ in public subsidies, loans, and contracts, yet he now dismantles the same programs as head of the ""Doge"" efficiency initiative. While attacking climate policies and regulations that enabled his success, his firms still profit from government deals. This hypocrisy highlights how privileged individuals often sabotage the systems that lifted them, privatizing gains while denying others the same opportunities.",pharrt,2025-04-29T10:43:19,7

"His family had to flee the Apartheid collapse in South Africa after stealing and grifting tons of money from citizens. Not only that, the family left his teenage sister behind to sell off their property and then join them in Canada because the master plan was to fly a young white girl across the country with tons of cash on her.   Soon enough, Mars is the only place he'll be safe.  https://www.flyingpenguin.com/?p=59531",Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T10:57:03,3

"They are so blinded by that ""mine, mine, mine"" mentality that they literally reject benefits if it will also help someone else. Health care, education, and a bunch of other social programs could be cheaper and better quality but if it means ""my tax dollars helping someone else"" then they are vehemently against it.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-29T10:52:03,2
