"When it comes to teams in the same city/region, you often do see slight differences in fanbase demographics, mainly due to location. For example, the Oakland A's are stereotypically a more ""blue collar"" and racially diverse fanbase compared to the SF Giants. Similar story for the Sox and Cubs. That being said, these divisions are typically driven by location and really more stereotypes than hard facts.  That being said, teams generally avoid outright political alignment, outside of generic pro-Americanism. You might get teams with outspoken owners, players, or a general culture of leaning a certain way, but nothing official.",MrPrimeMover,2022-08-15T19:28:05,12

Only as far as the regions are divided. Teams from south of the bible belt tend to have fans that have bible belt politics. Teams on the coasts tend to be coastal politics.,ShadeofIcarus,2022-08-15T19:20:26,8
"There are other football clubs that have associations with left-wing politics, like FC St. Pauli in Hamburg and Celtic F.C. in Glasgow",loselyconscious,2022-08-15T21:37:08,3
In Scotland you have a football (soccer) team for Catholics and another for Protestants (Celtics and Rangers) https://medium.com/sportsraid/keepers-of-the-faith-when-football-rivalry-becomes-holy-war-580c57270aaa,an0nim0us101,2022-08-16T03:22:56,2
Ohio State and Michigan (universities) have a rivalry based on the “Toledo Dispute” where shots were fired after the senate granted Michigan land to Ohio as Michigan was not yet a state.  The hatred exists to this day.,Shiftclick46,2022-08-16T07:28:07,2
"Back in the 90s, the Doral used to be a significant golf tournament on the PGA tour. The Tour no longer plays a tournament there for two reasons, the Tour moving the locale for the tournament down to Mexico, and the person that now owns Doral. The person who currently owns Doral is the most polarizing political figure in American History since Lincoln. Care to guess who?    Because of that person’s narcissism, and not wanting to share the limelight with the golfers that are supposed to be the focal point, the best tournament he has ever hosted was the US Women’s Open at his course in New Jersey. He didn’t understand that they used the Women’s open as an audition for a Men’s major. He failed so spectacularly at hosting a major tournament for the LPGA that the PGA took away his upcoming major tournament (fomenting a insurrection didn’t help).    Thanks to the Saudi Royal family and their notorious sports-washing, they have created a golf league to try to rival the PGA, called the LIV tour. Want to guess who was given two tournaments for the new league? Thanks to his ability to polarize a nation, he has now polarized golf by having two tournaments at Doral and Bedminster.    Professional golf has now become political. I heard it at work last night. I work where a lot of these red hat wearing people like to congregate, and a lot of them are casual golfers. They all hated the LIV tour, thinking it was taking talent from the PGA with blood money. They all thought this until the former president got two tournaments on the LIV tour. Suddenly, these guys are pro Saudi, and have completely forgotten about that country’s awful everything.",SaintedRomaine,2022-08-16T08:37:41,1
"Or the historic rivalry between Clemson University and the University of South Carolina - the less popular and well known USC.  USC was reopened after the civil war during the reconstruction, and the school was opened to Black's and women and was seen by some as a symbol of the worst aspects of reconstruction.   Clemson University was founded specifically as an All white, all male military college.  They were doomed to be rivals from the start, but Interestingly USC doesn't make the list of Historically Black Colleges and Universities.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-08-16T07:07:38,6
"I wouldn't say that Celtic were particularly left wing, or that Rangers were right wing.  Their division is largely due to religious sectarianism.  Partly due to the history of Irish Immigrants being heavily discriminated against, but quickly morphed into religious bigotry due to the majority of the Irish coming to Scotland being Catholics.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-08-16T06:54:32,3
