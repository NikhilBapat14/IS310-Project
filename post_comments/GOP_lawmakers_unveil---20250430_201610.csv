IDK how much of this is tenable.  It sounds like a bureaucratic cluster#$\*k of a compromise to ignoring a fundamental problem.  That is the US government has no business backing these loans.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-30T21:20:29,57
"1. Stop issuing government student loans of any kind, and stop backing loans of any kind 2. Change the fundamental social ideology that ""you must go to college to be successful in life and have a high wage"". That's simply not true at all 3. Stop paying out massive amounts of cash to schools from taxpayer funds, make them more dependent on private revenue sources, such as endowments, gifts, and tuition income. Yes, that includes research/program grants. No more government grants. Private grants or nothing. 4. Educate kids from junior high and older that loans aren't always the smart thing. That going to college non-traditionally (if they must go to college) is not ""weird"" or ""stupid"" or ""the loser's way"". They don't HAVE to get it all done in four years. Working alongside going to college classes is just fine and actually far more responsible than indebting yourself up to your eyeballs and paying it off for the next 20 years or the rest of your natural life. While all the folks who were ""cool"" and got it done in four years walk earlier than you, they'll be paying 1/4 of their monthly income (not including interest payments) paying that massive debt back while having to watch their credit scores closely. You.....walk with $0 in debt, and go start enjoying life, knowing your financial debts are minimal to none after graduation and start to collect bank with a nice clean credit score that only goes up.",ITrCool,2025-04-30T21:24:40,29
Good- I don’t like the govt backing these loans in the first place but at least the burden of the default would be shifted back to the schools. 4 year colleges are running the biggest grift on CHILDREN we’ve ever seen. The value of a 4 year degree is plummeting to the point most degrees aren’t worth the paper they’re printed on (less stem fields and a few others).   Colleges should be capped on the amount of loans that can be applied against every incoming class’s tuition. The rest needs to be a mix of families paying out of pocket and school sponsored scholarships. Colleges are profiting massively off the back of the federal government while offering little to nothing in return to students.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-01T08:00:42,6

"The govt should have never been involved in owning student debt, thanks Obama. This (owning student debt) was a complete setup meant to favor Dems and scapegoat Reps, what a disaster.  If higher education is completely free and government sponsored, it will become as valuable as a high school diploma.",Adras7us_,2025-04-30T23:21:58,3

"How about this, make the person who took out the loan supposedly of sound mind and pay it back. What a concept, you signed to take the loan and you pay it back.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T05:27:50,-1

"Yeah, but I at least appreciate that it incentivizes colleges to stop pushing useless degrees because they’re easy to get and guarantee the student will pay for a full four years  Watch how quickly colleges stop saying “The experience is worth more than just the degree”  EDIT:  I do agree, however. The federal government shouldn’t be backing loans, except perhaps in times of economic depression as an intervention. State governments should be trying to make state and community colleges competitive with private colleges to get more high skilled labor in their states, and make the majors relevant to the local economy.  But that would require Americans to care more about their states and their country than just finding the easiest grift, which will be a big cultural shift to achieve (and we all know who the ones most guilty of this are, and how they have their heads up their ass about being morally superior).",SpecialistNote6535,2025-05-01T05:37:19,20
">such as endowments  The problem with endowments is that they're often made to pay for specific things, like landscaping, and the school can't legally use that money for anything else. If that could be changed it would open up all kinds of money that would otherwise be underutilized.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-01T05:25:29,13
"I think your 4th point should be the MAIN point. The whole thing needs to start at a personal level to understand what you're doing. NO ONE would let a 17 year old sign the sort of loans they give out for anything else, why would we do it for college.",mojo276,2025-05-01T07:31:52,3
I don’t think Obama was the one that instituted the very first government student loans,packet23,2025-05-01T05:36:41,25
"This isn’t the ""own"" you think it is. People from both regions flock to our universities, paying full tuition.  Our system needs reforms in pricing and to address divisive ideologies, but yours fails to deliver results. Your economies haven’t grown significantly in decades. Hers is stagnant. Yours is a game of snakes and ladders.  So keep your juvenile critiques to yourself.",sixtysecdragon,2025-05-01T04:34:22,9
"I agree totally with making people pay back loans they take out.   However that does not address the problem that college tuition has skyrocketed way past any level of inflation. Schools have taken advantage of the fact that kids can get these loans and hiked all tuition and costs. There should be a limit tying increases at universities to the cost of living increases only. And then the schools charge ridiculous fees on top of the tuition. My daughter has a scholarship that pays her tuition 100%, but we still have to pay hundreds of dollars every semester for fees.",scrapqueen,2025-05-01T06:53:07,11

He did not institute the first of the government student loans but he DID [allow students to borrow directly from the federal government](https://abcnews.go.com/WN/Politics/health-care-obama-signs-student-loan-overhaul-legislation/story?id=10239569).,wanttostaygottogo,2025-05-01T07:26:34,-1
So you think charging thousands a month for a service that the rest of the world offers for *a lot less* is a benefit somehow? lol keep simping for ultra rich universities I guess.,Chikaze,2025-05-01T04:40:52,0
"If people actually accept they have to pay back the loans, then they might start shopping around. Or have their kids shop around because it seems today, and I am not a college graduate, barely 1 year, that college doesn't teach anything very useful. At least not from what I have read and watched.  It is like seeing these tv shows and movies where the people go to dine and they have barely a piece of lettuce on their plate and it is called dining while at the same time they are charged a small fortune for it.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-01T06:56:18,-5
"Just to provide additional context, the first student loans available direct from the government were in 1958: The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed in response to the space race. This offered the first national student loans, later renamed  the Perkins Loan program. These loans were directly available from the federal government on the basis of need. This act also had the first loan forgiveness clause, with a 15% reduction in payments for each year teaching in a school.",packet23,2025-05-01T07:45:32,10
"Yes, our pay-to-play system produces better outcomes. It’s far superior to your free, government-gatekept systems.  That’s why 36% of the world’s top 100 universities are in a country with only 4.5% of the global population.  We invest in them because they are vital to our nation’s health, strength, and innovation. That’s also why we’re so furious because they strayed from the values that built them.  And I love how you lazily call me a simp. I literally critiqued their financing model and ideological capture in my comment.",sixtysecdragon,2025-05-01T05:40:08,8
Maybe the university should have to finance the loans. Would give them more incentive to make sure the students have useful good job opportunities when they graduate,scrapqueen,2025-05-01T07:04:10,7

"It’s because we mock ourselves and you consume all our media. Look up basketball player Brian Scalabrine. He was once rated the worst player in the NBA, and people ridiculed him for it.  Since then, he’s built a career proving his critics’ ignorance. He’s famous for saying, “I’m closer to LeBron James than you are to me.” Even in his 40s, he embarrasses those who think they’re great basketball players.   And we aren’t even Brian Scalabrine.   We are LeBron.  So just because you critique us, and we critique ourselves, doesn’t mean you’re in our league.  So, enjoy your ignorance in the world we provide and protect. You can yap all you want at us. We’re busy working.  Also healthcare system is superior, with better outcomes, technology, options and access.",sixtysecdragon,2025-05-01T06:33:54,9
