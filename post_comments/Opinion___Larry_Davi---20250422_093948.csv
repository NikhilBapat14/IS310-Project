"""Imagine my surprise when in the spring of 1939 a letter arrived at my house inviting me to dinner at the Old Chancellery with the world‚Äôs most reviled man, Adolf Hitler. I had been a vocal critic of his on the radio from the beginning, pretty much predicting everything he was going to do on the road to dictatorship. No one I knew encouraged me to go. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs Hitler. He‚Äôs a monster.‚Äù But eventually I concluded that hate gets us nowhere. I knew I couldn‚Äôt change his views, but we need to talk to the other side ‚Äî even if it has invaded and annexed other countries and committed unspeakable crimes against humanity.  Two weeks later, I found myself on the front steps of the Old Chancellery and was led into an opulent living room, where a few of the F√ºhrer‚Äôs most vocal supporters had gathered: Himmler, G√∂ring, Leni Riefenstahl and the Duke of Windsor, formerly King Edward VIII. We talked about some of the beautiful art on the walls that had been taken from the homes of Jews. But our conversation ended abruptly when we heard loud footsteps coming down the hallway. Everyone stiffened as Hitler entered the room.  He was wearing a tan suit with a swastika armband and gave me an enthusiastic greeting that caught me off guard. Frankly, it was a warmer greeting than I normally get from my parents, and it was accompanied by a slap on my back. I found the whole thing quite disarming. I joked that I was surprised to see him in a tan suit because if he wore that out, it would be perceived as un-F√ºhrer-like. That amused him to no end, and I realized I‚Äôd never seen him laugh before. Suddenly he seemed so human. Here I was, prepared to meet Hitler, the one I‚Äôd seen and heard ‚Äî the public Hitler. But this private Hitler was a completely different animal. And oddly enough, this one seemed more authentic, like this was the real Hitler. The whole thing had my head spinning.  He said he was starving and led us into the dining room, where he gestured for me to sit next to him. G√∂ring immediately grabbed a slice of pumpernickel, whereupon Hitler turned to me, gave me an eye roll, then whispered, ‚ÄúWatch. He‚Äôll be done with his entire meal before you‚Äôve taken two bites.‚Äù That one really got me. G√∂ring, with his mouth full, asked what was so funny, and Hitler said, ‚ÄúI was just telling him about the time my dog had diarrhea in the Reichstag.‚Äù G√∂ring remembered. How could he forget? He loved that story, especially the part where Hitler shot the dog before it got back into the car. Then a beaming Hitler said, ‚ÄúHey, if I can kill Jews, Gypsies and homosexuals, I can certainly kill a dog!‚Äù That perhaps got the biggest laugh of the night ‚Äî and believe me, there were plenty.  But it wasn‚Äôt just a one-way street, with the F√ºhrer dominating the conversation. He was quite inquisitive and asked me a lot of questions about myself. I told him I had just gone through a brutal breakup with my girlfriend because every time I went someplace without her, she was always insistent that I tell her everything I talked about. I can‚Äôt stand having to remember every detail of every conversation. Hitler said he could relate ‚Äî he hated that, too. ‚ÄúWhat am I, a secretary?‚Äù He advised me it was best not to have any more contact with her or else I‚Äôd be right back where I started and eventually I‚Äôd have to go through the whole thing all over again. I said it must be easy for a dictator to go through a breakup. He said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised. There are still feelings.‚Äù Hmm ‚Ä¶ there are still feelings. That really resonated with me. We‚Äôre not that different, after all. I thought that if only the world could see this side of him, people might have a completely different opinion.  Two hours later, the dinner was over, and the F√ºhrer escorted me to the door. ‚ÄúI am so glad to have met you. I hope I‚Äôm no longer the monster you thought I was.‚Äù ‚ÄúI must say, mein F√ºhrer, I‚Äôm so thankful I came. Although we disagree on many issues, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we have to hate each other.‚Äù And with that, I gave him a Nazi salute and walked out into the night.",Lebarican22,2025-04-22T09:40:20,46

"Bill Maher has always been a misogynist, and when you scratch the surface of people with one kind of ugliness, you're going to find more ugliness. He's an arrogant narcissist.  No decent human being could take that thumbnail of an experience with trump and extrapolate anything good because the scumbag is old and his grift and nastiness should be well known to Maher, who claims to have some knowledge of politics.   Thanks, Larry.",MuggsyTheWonderdog,2025-04-22T13:46:00,10

I thought so. Yeah I happened to watch that next episode. Bill Maher is such an odd cat. I remind myself he has much financial security and lives in CA.,Steadyandquick,2025-04-22T12:29:31,6

"The point is not to try and humanize and normalize evil people by playing up their charms. Maher basically normalized a guy who's taking straight from Hitler's playbook, and used his position of power in the media to say, ""Awww, shucks, it's not so bad Trump's dismantling democracy and sending people to an El Salvadorian gulag, look, he can laugh at a joke just like you and me!"". David just took that and satirized the hell out of it. Because that's a way to fight back against dictators, they want SO desperately to be taken seriously while they're throwing tantrums on social media because Biden lives rent-free in his head. You *CANNOT* normalize this shit like Maher's trying to do. Because it's *not* normal. It's an obscene horror being wrought upon us all, while the majority of people seem desperate to bury their heads in the sand while their exposed asses are literally catching fire and they're still insisting everything is juuuuust fine.",navikredstar,2025-04-22T14:57:01,7
"Yeah, I used to watch his ‚ÄúNew Rule‚Äù segments on YouTube quite a bit, but 80-90% of those these days are criticizing liberals/the left. When he does criticize Trump or the right in general, it seems pretty tepid and weak. Honestly, it feels like Maher is in the middle of the same grift that Dave Rubin and Tulsi Gabbard went through. Something tells me he will publicly become a Republican within the next year or two.",HorrorJCFan95,2025-04-22T17:57:36,4
"Same here!!! He is a deep capitalist at his core and I got tired of him about 4 years ago too. He is so snobby, condescending and an overall dick. However, I will always appreciate his saying ‚Äú whiney little bitch‚Äù it fits so many people, not just Trump",hewasherealongtimeag,2025-04-22T14:37:05,3

I was totally disgusted by maher‚Äôs comments. Did he think he‚Äôd be greeted with a sieg heil? The premise Maher put forward is we have to be able to talk to the other side. Trump is not any person on the fucking other side. He is bent on destroying our country. He deserves no quarter. NO quarter!,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-22T20:55:42,5
"I agree that that is the point of David's essay, I'm confused why OP suggested that the summary from NYT opinion, which essentially states exactly that, is laughable.",snazztasticmatt,2025-04-22T15:02:43,2
Which is crazy cause I can‚Äôt think of someone who has a worse sense of humor. The only times he tries to be funny is by mocking people.,everyoneneedsaherro,2025-04-22T13:02:57,14
Many people who have met him say he can be very charming one on one. The rest of the people say he grabbed them by the pussy.,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-22T21:06:49,1

"He‚Äôs constantly cracking jokes and laughing (at least with himself). I‚Äôm not saying I think he‚Äôs funny, but to watch Bill Maher say with a straight face as if he‚Äôs actually breaking some crazy news that Trump laughs is one of the most bizarre things I‚Äôve ever seen.  We‚Äôve know Maher is a complete and utter fool for some time now, but this was just wild.",bob_weiver,2025-04-22T13:05:21,3
