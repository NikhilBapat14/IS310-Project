Elon Musk’s retreat should ~~relieve~~ fool no one.,2a_lib,2025-04-23T15:22:00,124
"From Paul Waldman, journalist and author:  “We’re not on the ragged edge of death, not even close,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk told investors on Tuesday’s earnings call. Those are not the words of a leader whose business is doing well, and the first-quarter numbers were indeed bad: In the first quarter of the year, Tesla’s profits fell 71% from the same period a year ago, driven by a sharp drop in sales.  Perhaps in reaction to those numbers — and Tesla’s stock declining more than a third in the same period — Musk told investors that he’ll soon step back from his role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). But whether you’re a Tesla shareholder or just someone who relies on the federal government — which includes all of us — there’s little reason to be reassured.

"Yeah, that's why I left like five comments to that effect on every post that seemed to believe him.   Anyone who doesn't recognize this as a tactical retreat needs to study a little more political science and history.",StevesRune,2025-04-23T16:46:25,7

"This should concern everyone. We are talking about a dude who loves basking in the spotlight and having all of the attention. The real question is what did he do that he is trying to get away from? I have a feeling it may have something to do with the recent access of government servers, and the fact that Russians have almost assuredly gotten access to that same data. We can't post links, but the best breakdown on the situation is on Ars Technica, strongly recommend giving it a read.  I legitimately think that he fucked up REAL bad, and he knows it. The question is if we are ever going to find out, and if so, just how bad is it?",Hammeredmantis,2025-04-23T19:26:17,5

"We’ll be living in the mess he helped create for the foreseeable future.  He can retreat all he wants, but backing off now will not stop my disdain.  I will never buy any product with which he is associated.  I will jeer him on sight.  I will attempt to restrain myself from hawking a loogie at his face, but I make no promises.  Eff you, Elon Musk.",Aumvor1,2025-04-23T15:48:57,6

"1. Damage is already done but it will continue with or without him.  2. Without a public face to the damage, people will begin to forget what DOGE is actively doing.  3. He's already installed software backdoors anywhere he wants, so if wants or needs access or data he can still get it (besides, Trump would give it to him anyhow).  4. He can still meddle in every election and every other public space because he hasn't lost every ounce of his wealth.",atreeismissing,2025-04-23T20:10:47,2
"Yeah. He got what he needed.  He has also left a mess of the Social Security payment system as he readies his Twitter payment processing business. I swear to God, I will never buy anything or execute any financial transactions that he will profit by. For a supposedly smart guy, he's so removed from the human experience I wonder if things got bad for him he would consider taking out his kids and all the baby mamas.",JacquoRock,2025-04-23T15:38:18,1

"Exactly. He's simply going back to shadows where he works the best. He's going to continue with the same crazy bullshit he started.  I hope this entire ordeal destroys him as much as it can to someone that wealthy. The ego hit alone would be worth it. Tesla won't recover as long as he's even remotely attached. And no one has faith in him in politics. He's spoiled man-child who never grew past 14. I'm going to see he's ALWAYS paid for sex, directly or indirectly, there's no way. Not with that look and THAT personality.   I hope he's run through the ringer and history destroys him.",The_River_Is_Still,2025-04-23T16:25:16,18

"I don’t believe this is the bottom.   Average revenue over three months probably does not show how bad things were at the tail end / right now.  He’s fooled so many people with the same lies so many times. As the company grew it made up for lies.   For the first time in years they are risking not just a loss, but a loss in top of negative growth and momentum on the sales side, and supply chain disruptions on the cost side.  And all that due to the owner’s politics. I’ve never seen someone actively trying to alienate his customers before. It’s astounding",Siideral,2025-04-23T15:42:04,18
"The damage Elon did is unknowable and widespread, and will not be remediated if he ""steps back.""  We have good reason to believe he exfiltrated vast amounts of data to storage he controls and will continue to have access to it.  He should be in prison, not ""stepping back"" and expecting people to be relieved.  His people are still working for DOGE and continue to breach important databases and systems for Musk.  Mission accomplished for him.",UnknownAverage,2025-04-23T16:22:05,9
