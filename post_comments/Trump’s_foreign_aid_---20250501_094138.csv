"The US is no longer the leader of the free world. Trump/Musk have weakened/destroyed our influence and alienated our allies around the world. China was willing and ready to step in and fill the void. Instead of spreading democracy, China will spread the wonders of a dictatorship and grow even more powerful.   In the years/months to come, these 100 days will be looked upon as the beginning of the end of the US.   Fuck Trump.",SAJ-13,2025-05-01T09:52:42,4
