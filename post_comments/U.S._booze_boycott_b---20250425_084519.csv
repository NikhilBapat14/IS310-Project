Well good....a small silver lining for our ALLIES to the north.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-25T08:46:41,31
Will be in Vancouver next month...any BC'ers with recommendations on breweries/wineries to check out?,Knightro829,2025-04-25T08:58:25,11
I live in BC. We have some amazing wine and equally amazing craft breweries. No need to buy U.S. wine - the Okanagan makes incredible stuff. The only wine I ever buy that's not from BC is NZ Sauvignon Blanc or Tempranillo from Spain.,squeakycheetah,2025-04-25T10:53:32,5
"Remember those interprovincial trade barriers that are supposed to come down?  Went into my local LCBO last week - a smaller one, granted - and they had ONE wine from BC.   So many amazing Pinot noirs from BC, if the LCBO won’t stock them then let me open my own store!!",Jablonski1971,2025-04-25T17:09:50,2
"And to be honest, wherever you are drink more locally if you can.",P1xelHunter78,2025-04-25T20:04:06,3
"If you're in Vancouver for beer, St. Augustine's is a 100+ tap beer hall with a bunch of one off and limited edition kegs. It is a great place to grab a few flights and try some things you'll never see again.   North Shore has a little strip of breweries a short walk away from the sea bus. Shaketown is a great vibe and Braggot is exactly what it sounds like--honey beer.   There's a cluster of breweries around Commercial that are fun as well. Start at Strange Fellows and wander your way up to Superflux.   The corporate breweries have their place. Steamworks is worth a seat by the window to watch the harbour traffic. Stanley Park is in the park itself and they usually have a limited keg brewed from ingredients harvested in the park. Granville Island is... well, it's still there.   The lower mainland has some wineries but they are the Delaware booze cruise of BC wineries. I'd suggest finding a couple of restaurants or lounges that do wine by the glass. They'll have the BC wine staples: Grey Monk, Sandhill, Sumac Ridge, Mission Hill, and Quail's Gate. Jackson Triggs is the Robert Mondavi of Canadian wine--avoid it.",silicondali,2025-04-25T09:36:36,5

"There’s one on Pender island called Sea Star that is really good.  I had it at a restaurant in San Luis Obispo, CA and ended up taking a trip there for the wine.",NoEmu5969,2025-04-25T16:29:33,2
Port Moody also has a street full of really fun breweries.,squeakycheetah,2025-04-25T10:52:10,2
