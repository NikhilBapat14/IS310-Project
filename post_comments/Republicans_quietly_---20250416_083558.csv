"Well Republicans, we could have solved this in 2020 if you impeached...assholes.",MARIOpronoucedMA-RJO,2025-04-16T08:58:42,73
"The chicken shits won‚Äôt do the right thing by passing a bill limiting trumps power and asserting the checks and balances guaranteed in the constitution. Instead they feel, like every Republican, the bed they made for all of us isn‚Äôt their fault and someone else should fix it",annaleigh13,2025-04-16T08:53:44,46
"Ironically, I'm sure the Supreme Court is quietly ~~hoping~~ wishing Congress would do its job and impeach-convict the lawless president who's openly defying the judicial branch.  Hey Congress. Last I heard, you were moving to impeach judges and create legislation to restrict their power against your MAGA god-emperor. Is that still going on?",BaronGrackle,2025-04-16T09:02:09,36
Is that why they just passed a bill in the house yesterday to try to soften the impact that judicial rulings have over the executive branch? That‚Äôs an interesting way of showing what you‚Äôre describing.,Internal-Flatworm347,2025-04-16T09:01:44,17
"Can someone please explain why Republicans are groveling at Trumps feet right now? It's his last term, he is more and more unpopular, he is taking away the power of congress, and he is causing longterm damage to the economy. Why do they continue to be ok with that? They should impeach him and let someone more stable take charge. I might not agree with their policies, but at least I dont have to worry about the country collapsing every 5 seconds.",MaximusDM22,2025-04-16T09:25:27,7

Kinda hard when he‚Äôs already blatantly defied the Supreme Court. What makes you think he will obey this time around?,amoreinterestingname,2025-04-16T13:05:36,5

They are afraid of him for some reason.  Impeach and let maga come destroy then Marshall law can happen,Straight_Button_5716,2025-04-16T09:43:21,2
I wish to god one of these reporters would just go rogue and out every single cowardly Republican who hates Trump in private. I mean it‚Äôs a civic duty at this point. Just one reporter should take one for the team. Bc of course their career as a journalist would be over. They especially should out the cowardly ass senators. Maybe they would vote to convict him this time. He will be impeached if dems win the house. And if dems win the house impeachment needs to look a little different. Like this time let‚Äôs hold a weeks long trial in the House where we have control.,Cluefuljewel,2025-04-16T09:50:35,4
Won‚Äôt happen. Trump owns them.,Happy_in_the_midwest,2025-04-16T10:02:54,2
"Congress, and the GOP especially, has institutionalized cowardice. They gifted away their own powers because they didnt want the responsibility, and in the process created an imperial presidency that was just waiting for someone to swoop in and abuse those powers as Trump is. Now thst hes here, they are too cowardly to take back thise powers and hope the problem will sort itself out through the courts.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-16T10:17:12,2

"They don‚Äôt even need to impeach him (they should). All they need to do is pass a law restricting his Tariff powers, as the constitution already states",Wenger_for_President,2025-04-16T09:19:07,104
"This is what I don‚Äôt understand, the Supreme Court has no power, he defies them and they gave him the power to do so. He needs to be impeached and removed. Immediately",Reckless_flamingos,2025-04-16T10:39:02,8

"Have you been paying attention?  Most of these Congressional Repubs are afraid of their own shadows, it seems.  If the SCOTUS does it for them, they will not get blamed, and won't have to worry about any retribution real or imagined.",crucial_geek,2025-04-21T14:07:32,1
They had two chances. But they chose party over country.,OhioRanger_1803,2025-04-16T09:06:05,25
"Because they know that once Trump leaves office (God willing), he will still hold immense power over the Republican party, unfortunately until the day he dies. I mean look what he did between 2021 and 2024, when he was out of office. He constantly ran his mouth on his ""social media platform"", and still issued orders. He has the power to destroy any politician that he has a falling out with, whether he's in power or not.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-16T16:37:17,2
Don‚Äôt insult vaginas or cats that way.  Vaginas are strong muscular canals that bring life.,HippyGrrrl,2025-04-16T09:11:00,17
That would never work as Trump would never sign that into law and there are not enough sane republicans to overturn a veto.,Spaceman-Spiff,2025-04-16T10:47:32,5
Problem with that is trump would veto it and they wouldn‚Äôt have enough votes to override the veto.,ukexpat,2025-04-16T13:51:58,2
"I do understand that, but it's the principle of it all. If they are hoping for SCOTUS to save them, when they have the power to stop him themselves, then why the hell are they even elected officials? It's so frustrating.",SlimShakey29,2025-04-16T09:30:14,49
"Maybe Fed judges need the ability to deputize their own Marshall's that are under the Judiciary, not the Executive?",crucial_geek,2025-04-21T14:17:19,2
I know that. But they won't have to worry about Trump's retaliation if he is literally not in power.,SlimShakey29,2025-04-16T16:28:44,1
dont forget they couldve told him to pound sand before 2015. so thats at least 3 chances.,Mental_Medium3988,2025-04-16T19:52:46,6
"If POTUS vetos the bill it goes back to Congress and if enough votes are there, I believe 2/3s in both Chambers, it becomes law, anyways.  So there there only needs to be enough Dems and Repubs.",crucial_geek,2025-04-21T14:14:57,1
"Totally. If everyone abided by ethics and law, he would never have stepped foot in the White House‚Ä¶",Wenger_for_President,2025-04-16T09:33:17,16
None of them want to have to say the quiet part out loud. They hope SCOTUS does it so his rage goes to them instead.,Callierez,2025-04-16T10:09:54,13
"They are not doing a damn thing right now because they are elected officials and want to remain so.  Some are considered 'safe', but others don't want to risk losing their reelections.  Also, as long as they kneel to Trump, Trump lets them do what they want.  So it is a two way street.  Vance is likely to be more hands-on than Trump, and more controlling, so there is that, too.  We'll see what it is looking like in a year or so.  If shit really gets bad, er.... bad for the average MAGA, then they may be more willing.",crucial_geek,2025-04-21T14:12:40,1
