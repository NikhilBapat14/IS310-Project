why does his wife need this information? This is a very alcoholic thing to do if he's doing  it to prove his wellness to his wife?  what's her background? I'm sure congress didn't approve the whole nest of Hegseths,JaVelin-X-,2025-04-22T13:16:14,169

"I've been out for nearly 20 years. I had a secret clearance while I was in the service.  My wife, jokingly, complains that I don't tell her anything about certain details of my job.

in my own lack of understanding in all of this it does seem that this program (open source which means its code is available free) will receive keystrokes that are yet to be encrypted and files yet to be encrypted to then encrypt them for transfer.

"She doesn't.  She is his 3rd wife (he's 44), a former producer, and apparently shows up via Hegseth invite to highly sensitive meetings with foreign military officials. The fact that she didn't shoot him down and say this is highly inappropriate means she is as bad or maybe even worse judgment than him bc I presume she is sober when getting these messages. I imagine she was not tripping on drugs when she decided to marry him.   Also a woman can dress however she wants but I shudder to imagine her pink ribbon outfits and general shit fashion at these meetings with foreign military officials ",Deep-Ad9239,2025-04-22T13:23:42,35
