"Let's clarify that this is a *temporary* halt pending judicial review.   Let's also be clear that President Trump doesn't really need to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport *illegal immigrants* or those who violate any specific conditions of their visas.   Let's hope that common sense will rule when the justices render their decisions. The fate of our country is at hand.   While the Democratic Party applauds those millions of foreign citizens who illegally enter and reside in this country, their aim is not for the benefit of the nation but to alter the political landscape. That's the ONLY reason they support illegal immigration.",chrismireya,2025-04-19T01:20:07,56
"The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration early Saturday to halt the deportations of at least 30 alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act.     “The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court,” the order reads.     Two justices, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr., dissented.     The Trump administration was preparing to deport the Venezuelan men, immigration advocates said Friday as they scrambled to find a federal court they could persuade to step in and block the removals before it was too late.     Attorneys for the detained migrants pressed federal judges in Texas, Washington and New Orleans, as well as the Supreme Court to intervene.

Nearly 2 million Mexican Americans, more than half US citizens, were deported without due process during the Great Depression.

"I'm not reading much into this either way.  There is a current case going *within* the appropriate jurisdiction.  That order points this out and says to hold on for it.    For the 40 or so years I've been following these kind of things, SCOTUS has always leaned heavily into process regardless the ideological bent.

I have had it with the Supreme Court. They are trying to be so impartial that they are giving far right groups like ASLU wins. Even the far left judge decided  to not intervene with the deportations.

"Lmao this comment is exactly why ""conservatives"" ultimately conserve nothing.   The Left violates every law and conservatives are powerless to stop them because as soon as they are elected into power, it's all about ""restraint"" and adherence to a set of ""rules"" that don't exist anymore (and never really did).   The Left plays offense while conservatives play defense (hell, ""conservatism"" is definitionally defensive). That's why the country drifts leftward, even when the people overwhelmingly vote against it. ""Conservatism"" is fake opposition, masquerading as some kind of moral code, where the only thing that gets ""conserved"" is inevitable defeat.   This is why Trump won the primary handily in 2016 and again in 2024 - ""conservatism"" is unpopular even among Republicans. It is a dying ideology because people are tired of being handcuffed to a worldview that doesn't even have their own best interests at heart.",mythic_dot_rar,2025-04-19T12:10:30,-10

The Japanese internment camps are widely regarded as an embarrassing miscarriage of justice today.  We need to use due process during deportation to avoid the same fate today.    Just because Democrats broke laws letting them in doesn’t mean we have to break laws to deport them.  Trump solved the immigration emergency by closing the border.  Now follow the law to deport.

">This is an actual law.      Yes, and all laws have limits.  This sub cheered when SCOTUS (correctly imho) said Biden's student debt relief exceeded the intent of the law.  But make no mistake debt forgiveness is given to the executive branch in a law.  And the court also limited stated powers of the EPA and overturned Chevron deference.   I don't remember much dissent here on those rulings.   We should all believe in the Major Questions Doctrine.  Judicial review is a key roll of the judicial branch (post Marbury) and it doesn't change just because an R or D is in charge.

" It's more like it has been buried. It took me going through almost nine pages of searching to find the relevant information after someone else had mentioned his usage in Discord (not reddits discord, mind you, but a political one I'm apart of)   It's similar to how the left tried to bury some of the things that Biden had done during his administration, you basically had to sift through a dozen pages to find the information.   For example: in 2023, Biden had a family deported from the country that had been here since 2004. This family sought asylum from prosecution from Syria and it was granted. In 2023, that asylum was rescinded and the family was sent back to Syria (this included the kids who were BORN IN THE COUNTRY and thus had citizenship.) Did the media report on this? Nope. In fact, only information you could find was in small journalist reports out of Chicago where the family had lived, including ICE going into the school were one of the kids was attending and arrested. Strange how the media had no problems with that, but threw a fit under Trump.   This is why I don't care when the left throws their hissy fits anymore.

"This the problem both with the article and many posters.  It is also an issue with reporting on the courts overall.  This isn't a decision on the merits.  It isn't a statement against Trump or a ruling to strip him of power.  It is the court putting a pause on it until there is an actual decision.  Whatever you believe on Trump's power here, the Garcia story has shown that if the people suing actually win, getting relief is next to impossible.  What's more, there's no actual harm to the country by putting a hold on the whole thing until a ruling is made.  Because of that, a hold makes sense.
