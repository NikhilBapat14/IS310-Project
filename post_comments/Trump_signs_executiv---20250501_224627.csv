"I Just read the executive order. There are two different parts. Direct funding for NPR and PBS and indirect funding through member stations.  I don‚Äôt know all the financials of NPR, PBS, and their member stations. From what I‚Äôve read I get the impression that NPR gets a small percentage of funding from CPB, PBS gets a higher percentage, member stations in metropolitan areas get more than member stations in rural areas. I‚Äôve seen some estimates that NPR stations in rural areas could get as much as 60% of their funding from CPB.  Many of the comments I‚Äôve seen say that NPR could afford to lose the federal funding but the main concern is the impact on rural member stations. I think the impact on any member stations seems more symbolic than actual. This is the exact quote from the Executive Order: ‚Äú(b)¬† The CPB Board shall cease indirect funding to NPR and PBS, including by ensuring that licensees and permittees of public radio and television stations, as well as any other recipients of CPB funds, do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS.¬† To effectuate this directive, the CPB Board shall, before June 30, 2025, revise the 2025 Television Community Service Grants General Provisions and Eligibility Criteria and the 2025 Radio Community Service Grants General Provisions and Eligibility Criteria to prohibit direct or indirect funding of NPR and PBS.¬† To the extent permitted by the 2024 Television Community Service Grants General Provisions and Eligibility Criteria, the 2024 Radio Community Service Grants General Provisions and Eligibility Criteria, and applicable law, the CPB Board shall also prohibit parties subject to these provisions from funding NPR or PBS after the date of this order.¬† In addition, the CPB Board shall take all other necessary steps to minimize or eliminate its indirect funding of NPR and PBS.‚Äù The member stations pay fees to NPR for programming. I‚Äôm sure those stations also have other expenses such as salaries, rent, utilities, insurance, vehicles, equipment, etc. I assume that the grants those stations get from CPB could be mapped to non-NPR fees.  I was an avid listener and donor of NPR starting in the early nineties. I loved the programming about science, technology, American culture, and the news coverage. Around 2010, I started to notice a change in NPR. It seemed like much of the programming was in lock step with whatever initiatives the Democratic Party was espousing. Maybe not so much with the news programs but the other programming. I still listened to NPR but it became more of bellwether of what the Left is up to.  Starting around 2017, NPR became unlistenable for me. They became so biased that I could not see any point in wasting the time. Their shows could be written by AI bots. I can‚Äôt listen to NPR for the same reason that I can‚Äôt watch Fox News.  I understand that this is a very sensitive subject for many NPR advocates. You have to understand that the position that NPR has taken is untenable. Republicans have tried to defund or rein in NPR since Nixon. As a result, many NPRers think this will also pass. Maybe it will. I think this situation is different from anything that has happened in the past.  I would love to see NPR go back to the programming that I loved in the Nineties. If they could do that, I would support Federal funding and I would definitely donate.",laserman2431,2025-05-02T13:49:02,0

"Maher: That's correct. So we receive about one percent of our budget. It goes to support things like body armor for journalists covering conflict overseas, extra support for our presidential national elections, all the sorts of things that we want to invest in to ensure that we're able to report on issues that matter to the public. But generally speaking, most of our operating budget comes from our membership fees, and that's what allow our members to be able to receive programming. It comes from underwriting support. It comes from private donations, individual audience member donations. **And that same thing is true for member stations, except federal funding makes a much bigger percentage of their total budget.**  Kelly: If all government funding goes away. Would we survive?  Maher: I think the question is ""Would we be able to thrive as a national network?"" That is what I am focused on is we get so much value as public media by being part of a 50-state network that covers 99.7 percent of the American population. If federal funding goes away, that network is absolutely at risk, the quality of service, the ability to cover everyone, people who live in what would otherwise be news deserts. And as a result, there's no question that NPR would not be able to pull from that richness of our national coverage if those local newsrooms ‚Äì  Kelly: So it would be local newsrooms that would be going away.
