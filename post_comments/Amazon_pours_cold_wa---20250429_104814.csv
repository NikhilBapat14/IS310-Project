How silly of me to think that Bezos might actually have grown a spine.,AllynCrane,2025-04-29T10:50:51,34
And just like that... The billionaires fall into line.   Hey Bezos... I have a story that is VERY relevant to YOUR situation: [https://asiatimes.com/2024/02/oligarchs-fear-putin-more-than-losing-their-billions/#](https://asiatimes.com/2024/02/oligarchs-fear-putin-more-than-losing-their-billions/#),williamgman,2025-04-29T10:51:49,13

I guess when Trump said these countries were going to be kissing his ass he was speaking of America and companies like Amazon.,Broke-Till-Payday,2025-04-29T10:51:20,9

"If you've got nothing to hide, then there should be nothing to worry about with showing a little old tarrif price hike on consumer receipts.   If this is a tax cut like they claim it is on Faux News, wouldn't they want their base to see all that money they're 'saving'?",Financial-Special766,2025-04-29T10:52:31,4

"I think we need to protest and boycott to get this!  Edit: In a separate thought, how can this statement threatening Amazon be legal?  How can any of Trump’s threats be legal? Where is the outrage?",KidKilobyte,2025-04-29T11:31:53,1
"All they were doing was listing import fees, which is basically copying what TEMU is now doing.  The fact that a congressman replied saying why didn’t bezos do this during Bidens administration for the inflation, now that, that makes me laugh.  They provoked congress to admit they don’t understand analogy.",Prineak,2025-04-29T11:02:39,13
"Every industrialist eventually hated Hitler. Some even died or were in concentration camps.  The industrialists think they're so smart but they can't beat the curse of the human condition. Demagogues are never to be trusted. Even among other antisocial people, eventually someone is going to want more of the pie, and be unwilling to share.   Bezos is doing this because the Amazon sales are dropping.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-29T11:05:28,3

"This is the thinking about communist China. That is why they are not negotiating with us, unlike countries like Korea, Japan, Vietnam, India, etc.. Why are you advocating a strategy that is used by communist China?",xibeno9261,2025-04-29T11:24:11,1
Exactly. Amazon was never going to do shit. ,patm718,2025-04-29T11:10:57,1
"They're not negotiating with us because Trump is not a credible negotiating partner. He changes his mind every few days and sometimes multiple times per day. He has imposed absurdly high tariffs that even he admits are not sustainable long term.   He is currently negotiating against himself, basically. What motive would China have to interrupt him? It's only a matter of weeks before the supply chain issues these tariffs are causing really start to kick America in the nuts. Shelves will be empty, trucks will be empty, and boy oh boy is the public going to be unhappy.   All China has to do is WAIT.",sp0rkah0lic,2025-04-29T13:53:17,1
> All China has to do is WAIT.  Which they can't. Just listen to the Treasury Secretary.  China will lose 10 million jobs.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7c3XI0KwfBs,xibeno9261,2025-04-29T15:14:07,1
"Lol. Treasury Secretary is a fucking muppet. He says whatever he thinks dear leader Trump wants to hear.   China is making deals with OTHER countries right now. We are driving Europe right into their arms. Also 10 million sounds like a lot but there's like 1.5 billion people in China. Trust me. They aren't coming to the table until Trump either capitulates and drops his absurd tariffs, or until there's a new administration.",sp0rkah0lic,2025-04-29T15:58:55,1
