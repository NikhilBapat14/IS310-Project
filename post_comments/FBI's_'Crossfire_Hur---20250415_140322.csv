"Pam Bondi go to work, if Comey et Al used the FBI to do this (and I believe they did), there are multiple felonies being conducted/performed And Comey and Weismann and a litany of others  were complicit, they should be prosecuted as soon as practicable!  They all once said “nobody is above the law”, I believe that covers them.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-15T22:25:18,2
"One thing about federal prosecutors is that they won't bring a case until then think it's a guaranteed win. That's why most federal prosecutors have near 100% conviction rate, they do their homework before they seek indictments.  Also keep in mind the heavily politicized courts in DC. Most of the judge were democrat appointed, and you can see best clearly today that they are not neutral or unbiased as has been claimed in the past. John Durham had open and shut cases against Igor Danchenko and Michael Sussman for lying to the FBI as part of the plot to destroy the Trump presidency, and the 97% democrat jury refused to find either of them guilty, because they were working for Hillary, and they certainly wouldn't want to give Trump a win that also hurts Hillary.  That's what we are up against with DC courts where these cases will be heard. Even if the prosecutor proves his case beyond a shadow of doubt, the far left DC jury could nullify the case by refusing to hand down a guilty verdict.   Your can be certain that the prosecutors under Bondi that are not democrat loyalist holdovers know the list of obstacles they are up against and are doing their best to figure out how to get convictions in these cases.",The_Obligitor,2025-04-15T15:16:16,5
