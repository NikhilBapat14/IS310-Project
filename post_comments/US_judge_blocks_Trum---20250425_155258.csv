"Kamala Harris: You know, everywhere I go, I tell people, you may not be a union member, but you better thank unions -- for the five-day work week, for sick leave, for paid family leave and vacation time, because we are all clear: Collective bargaining benefits our entire nation -- our entire nation. Because here's the deal. When union wages go up, everybody's wages go up. When union workplaces are safer, everyone's workplace is safer. So, thank a union. Thank a union. And the bottom line is when unions are strong, America is strong. Unions have always fought to make our nation more equal, more fair, and more free.

"Everyone who voted for Trump voted to put corporations EVEN MORE in charge of America. Corporations who notoriously kill unions both figuratively and literally.   Yes, they really kill individuals who start to unionize.  Anti-union companies like Ford, Coca-Cola, Amazon, Starbucks, Google, Meta, Walmart, among a ton of other American companies. The Battle of the Overpass is a really interesting read on the Ford anti-union history, which helped shape the country's labor movement.  https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/colombian-union-suing-coca-cola-in-death-squad-case/  https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/battle-of-the-overpass-henry-ford-the-uaw-and-the-power-of-the-press/",Financial-Special766,2025-04-25T16:40:01,3
