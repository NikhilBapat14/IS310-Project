"> Many historians emphasize that the Three-Fifths Compromise preserved disproportionate power for slaveholding states and was inherently discriminatory.  Christ, our press is garbage.  **All credible historians** know for a fact that the Three-Fifths Compromise was inherently discriminatory, because they have eyes and brains and know what words mean.",ANOKNUSA,2025-04-25T19:12:06,189

Indiana Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith,MyPartsareLoud,2025-04-25T19:00:58,25
">The Indiana Senate passed SB 289, which was introduced by state Senator Gary Byrne, in a 64-26 vote. Beckwith posted a video on Thursday to X, formerly Twitter, criticizing Senate Democrats for comparing the bill to the Three-Fifths Compromise. During the session, Democrats likened the bill to the 1787 constitutional clause that counted enslaved people as three-fifths of a person for congressional representation, arguing that the bill would suppress efforts to address systemic inequality.  >Beckwith said Democrats called the bill ""bad,"" arguing that it ""actually encourages discrimination, just like the Three-Fifths Compromise,"" but he countered that ""the Three-Fifths Compromise is not a pro-discrimination compromise, it was not a pro-discrimination or a slave-driving compromise that the founders made. It was actually just the opposite. It was a compromise that the North made with the South.""  So let's look what this bill does, shall we?   >Repeals provisions concerning university diversity committees. Prohibits unlawful discrimination in education, public employment, and licensure. Allows participation in public contracts by a minority business enterprise, women's business enterprise, and veteran business enterprise, as currently authorized by law. Permits scholarships based on a personal characteristic of the recipient if the scholarship is not funded by state funds or resources, and permits the renewal of specified state funded minority teaching scholarships for those recipients who were initially awarded the scholarship before July 1, 2025. Changes the criteria for certain state funded teaching scholarships from minority status to residence in an underserved county and an agreement to teach in an underserved county. Prohibits requiring as a condition of licensure that a person affirm that a person with a certain personal characteristic: (1) is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic; (2) should be blamed for actions committed in the past; or (3) has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person. Prohibits a public employer from requiring training asserting that, or implementing the theory that, a person with a certain personal characteristic: (1) is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic; (2) should be blamed for actions committed in the past; or (3) has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person. Permits a person injured by a violation to bring a civil action for actual damages, court costs, and injunctive relief.

"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.

"> he countered that ""the Three-Fifths Compromise is not a pro-discrimination compromise, it was not a pro-discrimination or a slave-driving compromise that the founders made.

"That said, an important footnote to this is that the three-fifths compromise is widely misunderstood. For anybody who isn't actually familiar:  It is correct to point out that considering a person three-fifths of a person is inherently dehumanizing and racist. However, in the context of the debate around Congressional representation, considering slaves full people would have actually been the worse option.  The sticking point was that the slavers wanted to count their enslaved people as part of the population *they* would get to represent. Counting the slaves for representation, while also still considering them property, wasn't giving those slaves any more democratic representation. It was giving their enslavers *extra* representation that they didn't deserve.  Of course, the proper ""solution"" to the compromise would have been to count them as full people for representation, but then give them voting rights... oh and while we're at it just stop enslaving them in the first place... but what can you do.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-25T19:30:02,84
