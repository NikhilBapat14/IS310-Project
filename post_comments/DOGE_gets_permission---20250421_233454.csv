"Why won't a court or membrer of congress simply stand up and ask:  ""Why does a team of a handful of IT speicalists need to access federal contracts and grants, treasury payments, immigration records, social security master records, health records, the post office,  all of this sensitive information about people, organizations, and institutions?""  I can't believe the government is just letting one team access everything involving digital records across every government institution, and several private ones.  I feel like I took a crazy pill and woke up in an alternate dimension where millions of people suddenly fell silent overnight.    When did this become okay?     Imagine if some group of 10 people showed up to your bank and said ""We need to look at all of your accounts.  Trusts,  checking, savings, brokerage, mortgages, everything.  No exceptions.   And we need to hook up these hard drives to the master servers.""    That's what's happening here.",GaimeGuy,2025-04-21T23:49:00,48

Kind of ironic that the folks that screamed the loudest about agencies sharing data and creating national registries are the ones that voted for this.,wwhsd,2025-04-21T23:52:58,12

"I think it's perfectly okay for tech bros in their 20s to do whatever the fuck they want when it comes to secure government information. What could possibly go wrong? It's not as if these puppies don't know what they're doing. These are people who have not been vetted for security clearance but, really, how important could that be?.",invalidpassword,2025-04-21T23:48:32,12

"I know! I don’t get why the conspiracy theorist vaccines-have-5g-to-track-me conservatives aren’t up in arms by this actual open stealing and pooling of our most sensitive information to be used against us either by our government, big tech, or leaked to our enemies.

"I spoke to one. She’s convinced they’re finding money that could be saved. I told her Elon makes $8 million a day. “That’s from his companies.” “And where does he get that from?” “From his cars!” “No, from government subsidies.” She didn’t understand I basically called Elon a welfare queen.  I even said if he makes that much from his ugly cars, why are they pretty rare to see in the first place?",liz91,2025-04-22T06:48:18,2
