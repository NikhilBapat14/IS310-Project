"Intervention in the Balkans was necessary to stop a genocide. There are basically two big rules on the world stage which are ""don't try to change borders by military force"" and ""no genocide."" When a country violates either of these rules it's a REALLY big deal. Serbia was committing genocide and Russia today is trying to change borders by force which is particularly egregious as it's coming against a functional democracy and is clearly against the will of the Ukrainian people.  The big difference between the two is that Russia has nukes and Serbia doesn't so a NATO intervention in Serbia was always possible but a direct intervention against Russia was not. Instead we see weapons shipments, a protracted war and Russia trying to get sympathetic leaders elected in NATO countries to cut off arms to Ukraine. NATO's resolve is certainly weaker today but Russia is also just a tougher opponent than Serbia due to their nukes and their massive stockpiles of conventional weapons.",socialistrob,2025-03-06T01:12:06,22
"NATO was more decisive, Russia was less decisive and weaker in general, the theater of war was much closer to NATO's borders, and Serbia was a relatively small country with no nuclear weapons.       I must remind you that even back then, NATO didn't interfere in the Russia-orchestrated wars in Moldova and Georgia.",Eminence_grizzly,2025-03-05T23:34:14,5

"It’s a really interest point with a lot of dynamics. It really comes down to how you feel on arguments of interventionism. Is an intervention justifiable if it does a good job? Is a military force in another countries borders (the former SFRY) without blowback? Is Russia bad in its invasion of Ukraine? Yes absolutely, but it’s hypocritical to state that violation of a countries sovereignty and its borders is the crime and not Russias intentions within. Western Countries violate borders all the time.   My opinion is that yes the intervention was good in what it achieved but it still wasn’t without repercussions. NATO involvement in B&H, Libya and Afghanistan means that despite its claims, NATO is in fact a Military Alliance and NOT a purely defensive one. Of course Russia is going to be provoked with an Anti-Russian, military alliance from Finland to Turkey. It doesn’t make them right or good. It’s like wondering why Iran is so belligerent to the US but realise that within 18 months the US has invaded, deposed and occupied both its Eastern and Western neighbours. It’s a very “Israeli” attitude from NATO. It seeks to  assert its own security with expansion with Poland and now there’s war on its Eastern border with Ukraine and it seeks to bring Ukraine into itself.  It’s also understated that Ukraine was in a civil war before the Russian invasion. As unlikely as even a Russian repulsion is, it’s unaknowledged what the problem of a reconsolidation of Eastern Ukraine might be. ",TheActOfPortugese,2025-03-06T04:49:00,2
"There is an analogy but you left out a key part. Is this not the equivalence. Russia=NATO, Ukraine=Serbia, Dontesk=Kosovo.  An internal part of a country, tries to secede, it gets suppressed by the country's military and an outside power interferes.  This part is always glossed over, Yanukoych's power base was in the Dontesk, when he was overthrown, they didn't like it. Imagine the reaction of somewhere like Texas if Trump was deposed somehow.",CasedUfa,2025-03-06T09:36:19,1
"NATO determined that Serbia was committing genocide and bombed Serbia on the grounds that ""human rights are above sovereignty."" Russia determined that the current Ukrainian regime was committing genocide in eastern Ukraine and intervened in the Ukrainian civil war on the grounds of ""eliminating Nazis."" These two situations clearly have significant similarities.   You can oppose both NATO and Russia, or support both, but one of the worst perspectives is to oppose Russia while supporting NATO, believing that NATO's claims are true—that Serbians were committing genocide—while dismissing Russia's claims as lies and fabricated excuses for invasion.   Why not frankly admit that these war actions are decisions based on the geopolitical strategies of major powers, and that those narratives are just excuses crafted by political elites to rationalize their actions and gain public support? Is it really meaningful for us to argue on the internet about which of these excuses is more justified?",Mr_Elie,2025-03-06T08:09:14,2
"Was there a justification? Yes.   Was NATO the right body to intervene? Absolutely not. It’s a defensive alliance, and one all too prone to conflating valid defense issues with offense actions.

"Of course, NATO was not right to intervene back in 1999. Before intervention, there were around 2000 casualties on both sides, where Serbs were killing Albanians, Albanians killing Serbs, and Albanians killing other Albanians they deemed traitors (most of the Albanian war leaders are now in the Hague for killing other Albanians). The ""reason"" for intervention was a false flag operation in Racac conducted by Americans. As far as Ukraine is concerned, from 2014-2022, there were around 14000 Russian casualties in the Donbass area, (some were even burned alive in Odesa). So, in comparison with Yugoslavia, the Russian invasion was provoked and far more justified. Obviously, if you are objective...To answer your question, if NATO was right back in 1999, they should have behaved the same and bombed Ukraine in 2014.",pageunresponsive,2025-03-06T05:04:23,-9
"Russia is also widely held to be comitting genocide against the people of Ukraine. The difference is simply a) nukes like you say and b) the US has been compromised by Russian interests and will not oppose Russia under Trump.  The latter is by far more important in my opinion, there would be no need to escalate to the point of a nuclear confrontation to ensure that Russia fails in Ukraine. Unfortunately NATO was not set up under the assumption that the US would fall first.",r0w33,2025-03-06T04:54:36,10

"> The big difference between the two is that Russia has nukes and Serbia doesn't so a NATO intervention in Serbia was always possible but a direct intervention against Russia was not.  This is not true and has never been true.  The idea that Russia might nuke us if we intervene is just in our heads, they're never gonna do it, because they don't want to get nuked either.  Consider: if Estonia or Poland or some other NATO members were invaded, would we hold back on fighting because Russia might nuke us? Obviously not.  And yet, what's the functional difference? Yes, there's an alliance there, but what does that matter to Russia? The factors resulting in them using or not using nukes are no different.  If Russia invades Poland and the US intervenes, we believe they still won't use nukes because we'd just nuke them back, right? Then why is it different for Ukraine? Because the alliance 'justifies' our intervention? But Russia will see our help as unjustified no matter what, they'll *always* have an excuse. So in practice there is no real difference in terms of nuke risk.",LLJKCicero,2025-03-14T08:40:30,1

"I do not support Russia's actions, nor do I support NATO's actions, as NATO also did not obtain authorization from the Security Council. Moreover, for all non-NATO countries, NATO's credibility is highly questionable. Without the authorization of the Security Council, NATO countries have initiated more wars than Russia. As far as I know, the Second Gulf War launched by NATO countries, both before and after, lacked evidence that the Saddam regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. Yet, NATO countries, which caused millions of civilians to be displaced under this pretext, faced no sanctions.   From the perspective of people in non-NATO countries, Russia's actions are no worse than NATO's previous military operations. We can only conclude that this is a world based on power rather than rules. If the same standards were applied, the same sanctions should be imposed on the United States, including Israel today. This is the fundamental reason why the vast majority of the population in developing countries remains neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

I have never claimed that Ukrainians should surrender; I was simply pointing out that the views of 80% of the world's population regarding this war do not align with those of your NATO countries. This is merely a statement of fact, not a moral critique.    NATO has nothing to do with the Ukraine war, okay, if you insist on saying that, then I’ll rephrase it as whether Russia is ""get a free pass"" depends on who is stronger between Ukraine and Russia. Even if Ukraine receives military and financial support from all NATO countries, this war has nothing to do with them, of course.",Mr_Elie,2025-03-12T00:45:52,0
