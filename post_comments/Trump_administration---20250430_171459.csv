"This won’t end the war, Trump will still be sucking Putin off. Trump will just pretend harder that everything is going great.",MotorcycleOfJealousy,2025-04-30T17:37:26,7
"Most of these minerals aren't even accessible or economically viable to extract, the same ais true with Greenland. Trump is just a simplistic fool who has an IQ lower than a lemon.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-30T18:03:32,1

Still a good thing. Once again Trump caved lol ,Current_Animator7546,2025-04-30T17:32:34,1
"The Trump administration reached a deal with [Ukraine](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ukraine) to give US investors preferential access to Ukraine’s supply of rare earth [minerals](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/minerals) on Wednesday, weeks after an [Oval Office](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/oval-office) blow-up between [Donald Trump](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trump) and [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky) put it on hold.

So if the US had just supported Ukraine this is what would have happened anyway.  All that with no impact to US soft power.  Trump is an idiot.,TintedApostle,2025-04-30T17:27:23,15
But why would we not want to look like evil idiots in the process? Dudes playing 4D Chutes and Ladders,19chevycowboy74,2025-04-30T17:32:10,5
Why would this have happened anyway?,fat_cock_freddy,2025-04-30T17:32:12,1
Because there is no reason to think that Ukraine would not have been friendly to nations which supported it against Russia.,TintedApostle,2025-04-30T17:40:42,4
I thought it was China's shut off of their rare earth mineral exports to the US which pushed Trump to sign this deal?,longgestones,2025-05-01T05:14:26,2
"Of course, but that doesn't fit into how the deal is described. What I'm hung up on in particular is that the article mentions ""preferential access"". They can't give preferential access to every ally, simply by definition. As well as mentioning ""...that will keep control split 50-50 between the two countries"".",fat_cock_freddy,2025-04-30T18:09:34,0
Its Trump......  expect exaggerations and BS.,TintedApostle,2025-04-30T18:26:54,1
