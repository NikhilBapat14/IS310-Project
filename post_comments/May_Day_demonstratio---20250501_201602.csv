Why the fuck would you try to do a nationwide rally when most people have work there is a reason the weekend ones have been successful.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T20:30:17,-31
"May 1 is a labor holiday celebrating a mass strike that happened nearly 150 years ago, starting the labor movement",jgoble15,2025-05-01T20:55:11,34
"Don’t worry that will change soon, the you having work part, the rallies will continue to grow.",Stjork,2025-05-01T20:33:43,23
My state's event started at 5:30pm,palenerd,2025-05-01T21:46:46,6
"Because formal strikes and informal work disruptions are key to toppling authoritarian regimes. May Day is a perfectly symbolic day to do it. Take a sick day next time, or failing that slowdown and work to rule, every one who does so brings us closer to the general strike we need.",Inevitable-Elk4488,2025-05-02T00:11:31,5
May Day. International Workers Day. It’s a pretty big deal,Silver_Double4678,2025-05-01T23:46:46,6
The protest in my city started at 5pm.,ChiaDaisy,2025-05-01T21:27:45,4
"I've heard the argument that if you do it in the weekend yeah more people show up to protest, but they're not really disrupting anything because the thing they're protesting, the government, doesn't operate on weekends",skit7548,2025-05-02T02:27:42,2
"I understand that, doesn't change that a lot of people are still stuck working which makes it seem like the size of the protests are decreasing vs the weekend protests thus lowering pressure.",redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T20:59:02,-15
In my case fairly unlikely but yes a lot of people will be losing work especially in the shipping industry.  The issue is we want each protest to have more and more people create a sense that Republicans have to vote to remove him or they will lose elections.  Create a sense that if they try to suspend elections it will have French revolution style consequences.  Having low turnout protests during the week doesn't do that.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T20:42:48,-2
Took 2 hrs off work and made it to a march. It took just a small bit of planning.,Kazooguru,2025-05-02T00:18:17,2
I understand that and most of us still have work,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T23:47:36,2
Do you work full time?  Most of us are mentally and physically exhausted at the end of the day.  As the saying goes the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T23:00:57,-4
"There were people using their lunch hour to attend the one in my city. Veterans in wheel chairs and on walkers, mostly seniors because we have the time. One woman told me she had first protested with Martin Luther King. There were protests all over my city. An entire high school walked out to protest cuts to education. More protests just makes the message stronger.",TrinkieTrinkie522cat,2025-05-01T21:11:24,21
You’re not wrong either,jgoble15,2025-05-01T21:09:08,5
I believe that a second American Revolution may be the only way to get rid of Trump and truly improve the country at this point.,LeatherJolly8,2025-05-02T00:47:41,1
"A lot of people plan for things like this, many who can use their sick days or call off. Please look up the history of labor strikes.",WhiteClawandDraw,2025-05-02T00:32:02,4
"In that example, the spirit is weak AF too.  “My spirit is willing to protest but I’m just too tired after work” has to be the lamest excuse I have ever heard. And that goes for almost anything requiring even a modicum of energy after work, not just a protest.",Prince_Uncharming,2025-05-02T01:40:46,5
Yeah. Getting taken over by fascists is an inconvenience for everybody,Silver_Double4678,2025-05-01T23:49:57,6
"Yea I do, I have two jobs. I can take one day and go to a protest after work because the message is important.",ChiaDaisy,2025-05-02T06:51:49,2
Yes but no if it's followed up with massive protests this weekend sure but if not it creates the impression that protests are going down.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-01T21:26:53,-11
That would be a second civil war to be more accurate.,Xikar_Wyhart,2025-05-02T06:30:14,3
"I'm gonna be blunt here man, who gives a shit about this?  If people are ignorant enough to believe the protests are actually getting smaller just because one happened on a weekday, they will be swiftly disabused of that notion when the next weekend protest happens and is obviously larger. Stop making a mountain out of a molehill.",nzernozer,2025-05-01T23:56:54,12
That could sadly be the case as well. But something is going to eventually give if things keep going the way they currently are.,LeatherJolly8,2025-05-02T13:51:19,1
Because the whole point of this is to keep enough pressure on that they don't feel comfortable enacting martial law.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-02T00:04:19,1
"Yes, so protesting on the actual date of an intentional labor holiday is part of keeping the pressure on.  The irony of you saying these protests were small when they were widely reported all over the nation. That is that keeping the pressure on means",NJdevil202,2025-05-02T02:27:38,6
"One protest happening to be smaller isn't going to do that. This is a totally absurd line of thinking you're going down. The media isn't even really remarking on the size of the protests, just that they're continuing to happen across the nation.  Seriously, take a deep breath and chill the fuck out. Having a panic attack over the fact that a protest was scheduled on a weekday instead of the weekend isn't healthy behavior.",nzernozer,2025-05-02T00:40:55,4
