"The scandal is that they were using Signal in the first place, not that a journalist was accidentally added. This crime is Hegsethâ€™s responsibility, no matter who gets scapegoated.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-01T12:46:10,2
"Trump went about this decision in the weakest, most inept way possible. Drawn out for weeks, and long enough for a 2nd Hegseth signal scandal to surface (sending military operations details to family members, unsecured).   Trump showed he doesn't really care about operational security, and he'll fire a guy only after the polling data is indicating how bad the scandal looks even to his base, making him seem weak, detached and ineffective.",localistand,2025-05-01T13:04:20,1
