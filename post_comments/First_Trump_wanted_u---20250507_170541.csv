This is eerily similar to the whole Brexit deal that took 5 years to make happen because they never made a deal until almost a year after the UK had officially exited the EU.,DevilahJake,2025-05-07T19:38:30,3

"Trump is a good businessman. At first he wanted to show that it was bad, to ruin the necessary reputation. Now that it began to bring profit, he kept quiet so as not to lower his reputation. After some time, I am sure he will say that thanks to him all this happened.",bto1980,2025-05-07T17:45:32,-6
Egg prices are about $10 a dozen where I live. Egg farmers (or are they called ranchers?) are the ones fucking us over and Trump won't do shit about the price gouging.,papaHans,2025-05-07T18:16:34,-3
He thinks when failing to deliver it's better to say you were being sarcastic than to admit you lied. üò≥,-CJF-,2025-05-07T17:35:14,9

Exactly! Don't say that and then get upset when asked about it.,css555,2025-05-07T18:21:03,4
Just wow.   I'm sure they heed you together for future wealth success to me when they do bad things to say bad and once everyone lowers then it all raises. By making more expensive keeper power. What you do is you twist left and then you give the wiggle,meatspace,2025-05-07T19:35:21,2
In what alternate reality has Trump EVER kept quiet lmaooo,mantisdubstep,2025-05-07T20:23:13,2
"Bruh it isn't the farmers fault, their chickens are literally dead from bird flu, there aren't enough eggs to go around, hence the price increase. We need to bring in foreign eggs.",97Graham,2025-05-07T19:36:01,5
He will accept the tithes given to him. That is what he will do.,meatspace,2025-05-07T19:36:07,1

you know what would help? restarting bird flu research and vaccinations for animals that trump stopped lmao.,acidrefluxisgreat,2025-05-07T21:00:13,2
Bruh? It takes four months for chickens to start laying eggs. That was November for the the bird flu. Plus they have insurance for that.,papaHans,2025-05-07T19:47:46,-2
Is the insurance going to lay eggs?  Struggling to see how insurance is relevant to egg shortages.,thejimbo56,2025-05-07T22:47:07,2
