"September 2021, Cuomo's former boss Shelley Ross accused him of sexual harassment in a New York Times op-ed. Stopping short of asking him to be fired from CNN, she said she would ""like to see him journalistically repent"".[40] Cuomo admitted to the incident, describing it as ""not sexual in nature"". He said he ""apologized to her then, and I meant it"".[41] In December 2021, Debra Katz, the attorney for another former colleague of Cuomo's, informed CNN that her client had accused Cuomo of sexual misconduct.[4] The woman claimed that Cuomo invited her to his office for lunch and after the woman rejected Cuomo's sexual advances, Cuomo allegedly assaulted her.[42][43] Katz has since claimed that this accusation precipitated Cuomo's termination.[44",WiseBlueHallow,2025-05-08T12:08:25,3

Succeeding the vaguely similar but much less popular Senator Bloat from the earliest ""Allen's Alley"" routines, Senator Claghorn, portrayed by Allen's announcer Kenny Delmar, was a blustery Southern politician whose home was usually the first at which Allen would knock.\[1\] Claghorn would typically answer the door with, ""Somebody, ah say, somebody knocked!
