I think it has been pretty well predicted by a lot of economists that this “policy” is harmful. Too bad the acid test requires suffering for no reason except to assuage the ego of a jerk.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-07T12:52:04,28
"It's baffling to consider this is a *lifelong* belief of Trump's, having heard him speak on the topic.  Imagine anyone who has had an interest in a hobby for any length of time. They know details about it, can describe things about it, can easily answer questions and are willing to offer up their knowledge.  Now consider Trump's simpleton responses to tariff questions, and his discussions of tariffs in general. There's nothing there. No substance, he starts deflecting and making wild claims almost immediately. His answers to questions regularly contradict his tariff statements.",localistand,2025-05-07T13:01:47,18
We talking about LSD? Kind of feeling like a really bad trip at the moment. ,arilupe,2025-05-07T12:51:43,7

trump does not like the free market. you can’t cheat.,[deleted],2025-05-07T14:19:43,2
"Usually with trump it's the last person he's spoken to. So in this case it must be someone standing near him repeatedly. I don't think Bessent wanted any if this. He tried to head it off.    Trump's people are crackpots, crooks or cowards. Bessent is probably a coward,but if he got some trump scamcoin then he's also a crook.",uniklyqualifd,2025-05-07T14:48:59,2
