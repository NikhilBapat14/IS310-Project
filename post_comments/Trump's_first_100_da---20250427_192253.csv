Remember when Trump and his friends claimed the Democrats wanted to destroy the economy and the country? It was all pure projection as usual.,BukkitCrab,2025-04-27T19:28:09,5

Weakening our defenses. Betraying our allies. Helping our enemies. Crashing our economy. Harming our people. Destroying our reputation.,Ouibeaux,2025-04-27T19:27:54,5

They are great at running for office and convincing people that Democrats caused all their problems.",NAU80,2025-04-28T05:38:09,1
