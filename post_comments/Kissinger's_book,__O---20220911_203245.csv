"Sorry for the lateness, I did not realize this was posted until today:  A lot of books that were written and released before Xi Jinping took place are going to be outdated because how much China has changed since then.  Now, not all of them are totally useless as good ones still provide a good insight on the party, how government generally operates, and the history of everything, as a whole but you have to be aware that Xi has taken most experts by surprise and things are very different now than ten years ago.    Outside of that though, Kissinger is worth reading because he is pretty much a primary source on historical USA-Chinese relations and thus has insight there.  I wouldn't take his modern analysis of China seriously though, as he always been criticized for being extremely uncritical of China and taking their statements at face value, which has made him more and more out of touch with the current political climate in China.",Naliamegod,2022-09-27T05:57:53,1
"That's very insightful thank you. Are there any good comprehensive sources on China, preferably someone that has been consistent with their views on China's potential, and not simply ""catching up"" to the realities of the Xi Jingping era? I dislike studying experts that revise their views and are dishonest about their previous misjudgments.   Additionally, I'm curious to know why it was that sheeting shi jing ping took most everyone by surprise? What factors go into that?",gomi-panda,2022-09-27T10:30:51,1
"*The Third Revolution: Xi Jinping and the New Chinese State* by Elizabeth C. Economy is a good primer on the Xi era.  *The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers* by Richard McGregor, while clearly a bit outdated, is a good introduction to how the CPC actually operates on a ground level and will give you an idea of how the party was just before Xi took over.  >Additionally, I'm curious to know why it was that sheeting shi jing ping took most everyone by surprise? What factors go into that?  Xi's father was a figure in the ""reform"" camp of the CPC and was actually one notable political figure who was hurt during the Mao era.  His early positions and moves also placed Xi in the ""reform"" camp and was contrasted to Bo Xilai, who was viewed as his main rival for party control, who was more of a throwback to old school Maoism.  Most people expected Xi to be a continuation of the reform politics, but he made a big shift a few years into this leadership.",Naliamegod,2022-10-04T20:51:27,1
