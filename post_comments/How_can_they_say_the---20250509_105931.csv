"The great philosopher George Carlin said it best   ""Boy, these conservatives are really something, aren't they? They're all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you're born, you're on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don't want to know about you. They don't want to hear from you. No nothing. No neonatal care, no day care, no head start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you're preborn, you're fine; if you're preschool, you're fucked.""",GoodeyGoodz,2025-05-09T11:41:25,60

"This is not new.  They've always hated kids...<see the pushback on free school breakfast and lunches>.  In 2023, 13.5% of U.S. households (18 million) experienced food insecurity at some point, a slight increase from the 12.8% in 2022.   THIRTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT!!!  This is America...no one should be hungry.",Tettamanti,2025-05-09T11:17:23,11

"How can they say they are for less government when they keep forcing government into a women's uterus, the bedroom, and the schools?",tinyE1138,2025-05-09T11:38:59,5
it was never about the kids. they just feel comfortable showing it now since their leader is in,hunnypiie,2025-05-09T11:27:35,4
"And as far as schools go, they seem to downright love dead kids.",Alniter,2025-05-09T12:04:13,3
"The goal is suffering. They want the government as it is to be associated with suffering. Then they can say ""we will fix that for you because it's clear democracy and government run institutions cause suffering."" Then they will sell us out to private enterprise in the name of ""fixing"" things and divide the country into economic parcels that they will profit from in perpetuity. This has always been their plan.",statmonkey2360,2025-05-09T12:17:22,3

"The thing I don't understand is why they are so pro life, until it actually comes to paying for healthcare. Like if someone dies because their ACA healthcare coverage was revoked and they couldn't pay for treatment that's not anti life?",Super991coolguy,2025-05-09T14:42:18,1
Remember that hate is the reason they voted. That makes it easier to understand.,Aggravating_Tax_4670,2025-05-09T14:50:57,1
"They only care to get votes. It’s an issue that plays well for them, historically. Now that mindset is slipping away, they’re resorting to more desperate measures with gerrymandering, changing voting laws, defying the Supreme Court, arresting federal judges, and they’re just getting started on their descent into authoritarianism.",mac_duke,2025-05-09T20:32:09,1
