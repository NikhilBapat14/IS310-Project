You can only be denaturalized for lying on your citizenship application the number of American citizens denaturalized is very small most were ex Nazi's from Germany. Since Trumps first election the DOJ has paid more attention to this. The Gov't spent millions investigating less than a thousand cases. More likely for immigrants to have their permeant resident status revoked.,One_Material_8906,2024-11-13T22:17:57,1
"Exactly and here is a great example. In 1995 Elon Musk was admitted to graduate school at Stanford but didn’t enroll in classes, instead working on an online services startup that would eventually be known as Zip2. Musk and his brother Kimbal were at one point “illegal immigrants” obtaining authorization to work in the US within 45 days. Their immigration status was not what it should be for them to be legally employed running a company in the US. And Trump just appointed him and that other horrible man to run the Department of Government Efficiency. So, who knows, since everything seems to be up in the air right now.",Sevenof1999,2024-11-15T21:18:25,1
