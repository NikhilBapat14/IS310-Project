"You don't need to identify yourself with an ideology group. You just need to understand your stance on the issues you care about and be able to talk about that stance competently. It's okay to not have a stance on issues that are important to other people. It's also okay to change your stance when exposed to new information.  The idea that you need to categorize yourself into a certain ideological bucket is a propaganda method meant to get you to identify with the more palatable aspects of an ideology so you are more likely to agree with the less palatable aspects of that ideology. It also gets you emotionally invested in defending aspects of that ideology when presented with contradictory evidence.  When political scientists categorize people into ideology groups, it's a method of describing behavior. When people start identifying with those descriptors, it becomes a method of prescribing behavior and enforcing it on other people.  You don't need to play that game. You can be a perfectly well informed politically invested individual and not identify with any ideology. Eventually, you might accept an identity as a description of your beliefs, but you don't need to tie yourself to that identity. If you are pro-widget and are called a widgetist, it's okay to call youself a widgetist. It's also okay to stop calling yourself a widgetist when other people who call themselves widgetists start believing in something you don't believe in.  Whatever you do, don't go chasing political compass or its derivatives. They're designed specifically to get you to identify with weird idiosyncratic identities so you feel ostracized from the mainstream. If you want to read a dense philosophical work on the subject of identity and politics, I highly recommend [Hannah Arendt's *The Human Condition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Human_Condition_(Arendt_book\)).",Volsunga,2024-12-30T11:49:02,49
"The problem with trying to understand these things is that as much as ideology often talks about theory and principles, they are also very much about identity and are not easily defined; they have tons of overlap. Within the category of communism, for instance, you have Trotskyists, Council Communists, Maoists, Titoists, Luxembourgists, Eurocommunists, and about 100 more, all of whom can talk for hours about how they are the ""true communists."" This is more or less the case for all the categories you mentioned.  A good place to start, though, would be a textbook.[ This is the textboo](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393542240)k I used in college, which has a ten-page section on Political Ideologies that gives a very basic overview.  A little more advanced is the book [Ideology: A short introduction](https://academic.oup.com/book/768), chapters 6 and 7 will give you a more extended but still simplified overview. The rest of the book is metacommentary on what even is an ideology, which is also interesting but not exactly what you are asking about. I can also if you would like to give some recommendations on the specific ""ideologies"" (not all of which really are ideologies) you asked about",loselyconscious,2024-12-30T16:06:30,8
"Well, you're not obligated to identify yourself as anything. Even though each political label has a culture surrounding it, the fact is that these ideologies are more like a constellation of common viewpoints than something monolithic. There's a lot of variation in there. It's like a bunch of different variables united by a generally similar set of values and not so much a uniform thing.  If you want to dig in a little bit on what the major political parties in the US believe, I'd recommend a data-driven approach. As in, take a look at some polls about where voters in each party stand. This will give you a cleaner idea of what people believe, without the heavy editorialization you can often find in places like YouTube. Of course, feel free to read/watch/listen to as much editorialization as you want but sometimes it's hard to sort out the facts from partisan rhetoric.  A good source is the Pew Research Center. They release poll-based reports on about a monthly basis (sometimes a little more frequently.) https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/politics-policy/partisanship-issues/?_formats=report",UnfoldedHeart,2025-01-01T12:26:55,3
"Read history to understand politics. Browse the shelves of your [local library](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/CommunityServices/find-libraries.aspx).  Politics is a means to promoting specific outcomes, exercising and maintaining power. If you want to develop your sense of politics, develop your sense of morality. You can always evaluate a political outcome on the basis of your own internal moral compass.  To understand why we need society, government and politics you can look at what happens when power structures are left unchecked.   If you want to understand how people survive political oppression you could read Viktor Frankl - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s\_Search\_for\_Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) he was a psychotherapist imprisoned in concentration camps by the Nazis.  You can read up on the Trail of Tears or Pinochet's Chile. Take any example from the list of human atrocities we have committed on each other and you begin to see why we need to center uplifting humanity in all facets of life. Go from there.

"Try to find publications online that are political. For right wing, I’d say first things, the American conservative, crisis magazine, and (if you’re a patient person ) the National review.   For left leaning, try the Atlantic, Al Jazeera, the baffler, jacobin, the ny review if books, and the la review if books.   Or just google it. I’m sure there’s a few articles written by people about good ones  https://thebaffler.com/ https://www.firstthings.com/ https://www.theamericanconservative.com/",FlanneryODostoevsky,2025-01-03T14:27:52,2

"Rule 1. If an ideology isn't grounded in good reason, good evidence based reason, then you should probably not hold it.  https://www.google.com/search?q=should+ideologies+be+grounded+in+good+reason+not+tribalism",TarnishedVictory,2024-12-30T14:40:45,1
"I don’t think it is correct that you only need to know your own stances on particular issues. That isn’t really helpful to understanding politics. Any ideological grouping has a historical origin and tradition that is important to understand. This helps you understand the motivations of particular groups (parties, trade unions, ethnic minorities, religious groups, etc) who identify with particular ideologies.   Ideological groups generally cohere around (more or less) coherent ideas, and political beliefs can also be coherent or reinforce each other in certain ways, or can be mutually incompatible. In the first case, a belief that people everyone should have access to the medical care they require can be compatible with a fully public or some types of mixed public/private healthcare systems. In the latter case, universal health coverage is incompatible with a fully private healthcare system and low taxes. It is important to recognize these contradictions, which many Americans don’t, and our politics are worse for it.   Certainly don’t worry about trying to fit yourself into a certain label, but think about what you think the role of the government is, what problems it should address, and what you think it should look like for the government to address those problems. At the same time, try to learn as much as you can about the basics of what people mean by terms like left, right, liberal, conservative, libertarian, and socialist. These all can mean different things to different people and in different contexts. But whether you identify with any of these or not, they are big parts of the language of politics and it’s important to have a basic understanding of what they mean, even just to know what other people are talking about.",Polyodontus,2024-12-30T23:59:03,8
"Couldn’t agree more. You might align with a certain group on a couple of issues but that doesn’t mean you need to align yourself with them on every single thing. Also, just because someone might disagree with you doesn’t make them a bad person. They might’ve just had different life experiences than you.",Direct_Crew_9949,2025-01-03T21:09:38,2
