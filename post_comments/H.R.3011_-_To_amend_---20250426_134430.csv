People would be able to finally beer/liquor trade legally without skirting the law.   Edit: if you didn't know beer/liquor trading is due to how alcohol is distributed your area doesn't have the capability to buy certain alcohol across the the whole country.Â  So you make a trade with something you have access to for something you want from someone else and vice-versa.Â ,James_H_M,2025-04-26T14:50:15,3

"So...lots of wine is not going to Canada and lots of vintners are probably looking to off load stock in the states. Which, will put more wine than usual in local markets, therefore bringing down the prices overall. This type of legislation may assist them with that process.",citizenjones,2025-04-26T17:42:10,2

UPS and FedEx already carry spirits with no issues. FedEx once brought me a bottle that was technically a hazardous material the proof was so high. Might as well let USPS get in on the action.,AnalTongueDarts,2025-04-26T15:03:09,6
