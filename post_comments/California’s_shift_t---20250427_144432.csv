"1. dems cater to the right 2. dems get obliterated 3. ""we lost because we didn't cater to the right enough"" 4. return to step 1  This party is run by a bunch of fucking mummies and ghouls who consistently snatch defeat from the jaws of victory and then convince themselves the only reason they lost was because they didn't sabotage themselves and alienate their voter base enough.  Dems don't lose because the country is on a rightward trend. It might *be* on a rightward trend, but that's because one party is exceptionally good at gaslighting and appealing to the vast majority of voters who don't know what's going on with hollow promises that they'll ""make things better"" and the other party is convinced that ""I know that you struggle to afford basic necessities and an emergency trip to the hospital will put you in crippling debt for the rest of your life, but let's uphold the status quo, people"" is a winning strategy and that they're only being held back from victory by those pesky minorities and LGBTQ+ people.   Want evidence that people don't give a shit about ""left"" or ""right""? People switched from Bernie to Trump. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any two American politicians who are more diametrically opposed on the political left-right spectrum.",swamp_god,2025-04-27T15:02:07,4

"Do not bother reading the article. It appears they just plugged a hose into the butt of a delusional trumper and just let it rip.

"My SO during college attended the Chronkite school at ASU and got her masters in journalism at UoA.   I am thankful she was in my life, and for the critical thinking she, along with so much else brought to my life when leaving the bubble of a neighborhood I was born.   Its been really interesting seeing how proper journalism has been disrupted and warped over time. Then the rise and evolution from bloggers to social media and echo chambers of mob mentality driven by opinion and emotional manipulation taking over the realm of what most people recognize as journalism today.   Today, there are still great sources of journalism, but they don't tend to be free (beyond a couple articles) and as deeply ad driven, or have the same spend or billionaire backing for SEO and having their app preloaded onto a device.   I have no idea how they rank now, some of the best traditional journalism departments in the country used to be found at ASU and UoA.",random_noise,2025-04-27T15:56:42,2

"Don't really understand how you managed to get ""all Dems and old people bad"" from that comment.  I have voted straight ticket Dem for as long as I've been eligible to vote. A good number of the votes I've cast have been for politicians over the age of 80, because I'd rather vote for a fossilized Dem than a Republican of any age. There is no foreseeable point in the future that I'd ever consider voting for a Republican. That doesn't stop me from recognizing that the current party leadership is ridiculously inept and dead set on sabotaging anyone who wants to push a progressive, populist agenda, even at the party's own detriment, and that their doing so is likely a massive contributor to why Trump ended up getting elected in 2016. And it also just so happens that a lot of these leaders are, yes, old as shit. Newsom might not be one of them, but his sentiments absolutely echo those of suspiciously mummy-shaped Democratic ""strategists"" like James Carville.  I don't mind old politicians, though I think there's obviously  a problem when we have shit like a representative disappearing and showing up in a retirement home. What I do mind is that so many seasoned politicians have just decided to put up no fight whatsoever, and yes, I think that's a general trend in the Democratic party.",swamp_god,2025-04-27T17:13:32,2
