A lot of people fell for the whole War on Terror shtick, but Trump is just openly a bad guy conman who says he will be supreme leader.  Every powerful Republican should know they are screwed once he or his successor feels threatened by them, and every rich Republican should know that he may rob them just the same as if you had your money tied up inside a dictatorship.",mlc885,2025-04-26T10:07:24,13

January 20th, who got prosecuted?   A bunch of idiots (everyday MAGA citizens) who lacked education, sense, and critical thinking skills.
