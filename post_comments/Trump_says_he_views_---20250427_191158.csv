"Well...Trump was the one throwing a bitch fit while Zelenskyy maintained his calm and composure throughout that entire White House spectacle. I'm not sure how Zelenskyy could have been ""calmer"" when he always was to begin with.",hskfmn,2025-04-27T19:16:53,40
Most people are calmer when Vance isn‚Äôt in their face.,snarky_marmot,2025-04-27T19:15:04,26
"Ick.  That's got ""See, now that you aren't emotional we can talk.  Isn't this better?""  abusive husband vibes.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-27T19:20:06,42
"It's easier to listen and be listened to when not surrounded by a circle of advisors poisoning the talks like Grima Wormtongue.  Regardless of Trump's affection towards Putin, he's in an information vacuum:  Tulsi Gabbard curates what he sees from our intelligence agencies.  Vance is there to explain it in a way Trump likes to hear.  Rubio is there to sit silent.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T19:21:14,17
Zelensky has been calm the whole time lol   The only situation that created any tension was the one needlessly brought on by Trump and JD Vance.,Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-04-27T19:30:06,17
Trump didn't have all his fuckboi fan base in the room with him.¬† plus they were at a funeral for a pope for fucks sake.¬† did he think Z was gonna go apeshit or something?,Clubsandiches,2025-04-27T19:15:03,9
"When was he not calm??? Throughout this entire war, I've always been amazed by how calm Zelensky is, considering the circumstances he's in. What I mean is, yes you can see his emotions and tell when he's sad or angry, but he manages to keep it under control very well, much more than most other people would be able to. I'm talking about all of his interviews in general, but especially the Oval Office meeting. Some people criticized him because they thought he wasn't nice enough or whatever, but I actually thought he was restrained, compared to what I would have done, lol.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T19:29:26,7

Dude just realized his initial plan going into this terms is massively backfiring and is trying to walk some of what he said back without making it look like it‚Äôs just because he was being an idiot,A1sauc3d,2025-04-27T19:26:35,3

Did he say thank you while wearing a suit?,Imacatdoincatstuff,2025-04-27T19:46:08,2
"Oh, does he seem 'calmer' now that he's not being berated by two idiot Putin clowns on Russia State Media TV in an entirely different country? How quaint.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-27T20:14:27,2
"The idea that we should have to care what the crusty old thug has to say about a man who is his better in every conceivable way makes me sick.  The minute he's gone, people are going to start pretending they always knew he was stupid and cruel.",sleepingbeardune,2025-04-27T20:53:23,2
"What we should really be paying attention to here is that when Trump's posse isn't around, he's suddenly calmer and more open to logical discussion with other leaders.   To me that screams that Trump isn't all there and his cabinet are manipulating him in various directions. That would make all of this uncoordinated chaos make a little more sense.   As much as I distaste the guy (a lot), at some point society needs to openly discuss this in the terms of what is essentially elder abuse, so that maybe we can at least get the P2025 folks out of his ear and stop some of the crash and burn methodology in the immediate timeline.",OklahomaBri,2025-04-28T08:26:11,2

Everything‚Äôs personal.   It‚Äôs not that Zelenskyy had reconsidered or had received updated information or something logical.  It‚Äôs that Zelenskyy‚Äôs emotional state was easier for the President to accept.,Imacatdoincatstuff,2025-04-27T23:48:01,1
More fucking gaslighting.  Z sat in the Oval Office and was ridiculed by a Trumpcult Circle and still remained calm and professional.  It was Trump and his henchmen that were acting like playground bullies on extra doses of steroids.  God this shit is getting old.,SunGregMoon,2025-04-28T07:27:23,1
