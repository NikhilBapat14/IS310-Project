He would remain a Senator. He would leave the GOP caucus in the Senate and join the Democratic caucus in the Senate. He would also need to switch financial support from the RNC to the DNC.   But senators have swapped parties before with little to no fanfare.,ProLifePanda,2022-11-13T08:37:05,3
"Belonging to a party has no legal relationship with your seat as Senator. Someone could get elected belonging to any, or no party, and could change or leave any party at any time. It isn't typically done because being a flip-flopper is often really bad for your image.  There are cases, such as the case with Tulsi Gabbard, where she was detached from the democratic party's majority values for many years before announcing that she was leaving it. In this case the optics were not as bad, as her values did not appear to change.",yaya-pops,2022-12-05T17:25:26,1
