"It always bears repeating that, when he put together his ""study"" attempting to link MMR vaccines and autism, Andrew Wakefield was not doing so out of stupidity, incompetence, or ignorance. At no point did he hold the genuine belief that the MMR vaccine caused autism.  It wasn't incompetence, it was malice. Wakefield was (and is) a fraud.  He actively manipulated data to support his claims, and had a co-conspirator who was pushing an alternate ""safe"" vaccine. The purpose of the study was to smear their competition and make millions, which they do to this day as part of the antivax movement, where people like him command hefty speaking fees and have millions of followers.  RFK Jr. has been the superstar of that same movement for decades. His primary source of income throughout his life has been via that stardom. And they are *all* frauds.  It is absolutely 100% that he has a financial incentive with any ""alternate"" cure he proposes, just as all the top people had stakes in Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin during COVID. They are all themselves vaccinated to the gills. Nothing they say or do is in good faith. RFK Jr. is a fraud and he doesn't care how many people his lies kill.

" [RFK Jr. rejects cornerstone of health science: Germ theory](https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/rfk-jr-s-anti-vaccine-stance-is-rooted-in-a-disbelief-in-germ-theory/)  >Germ theory is, of course, the 19th-century proven idea that microscopic germs—pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi—cause disease. It supplanted the leading explanation of disease at the time, the miasma theory, which suggests that diseases are caused by miasma, that is, noxious mists and vapors, or simply bad air arising from decaying matter, such as corpses, sewage, or rotting vegetables. While the miasma theory was abandoned, it is credited with spurring improvements in sanitation and hygiene—which, of course, improve health because they halt the spread of germs, the cause of diseases.  >Germ theory also knocks back a lesser-known idea called the terrain theory, which we've covered before. This is a somewhat ill-defined theory that generally suggests diseases stem from imbalances in the internal ""terrain"" of the body, such as malnutrition or the presence of toxic substances. The theory is linked to ideas by French scientist Antoine Béchamp and French physiologist Claude Bernard.   ...   It's important to note here that our understanding of Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory isn't based on speculation or deduction; it's based on Kennedy's own words. He wrote an entire section on it in his 2021 book vilifying Fauci, titled The Real Anthony Fauci. The section is titled ""Miasma vs. Germ Theory,"" in the chapter ""The White Man's Burden.""   ...   In the chapter, Kennedy promotes the ""miasma theory"" but gets the definition completely wrong. Instead of actual miasma theory, he describes something more like terrain theory. He writes: ""'Miasma theory' emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and by reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses.""   ...   In all, the chapter provides a clear explanation of why Kennedy relentlessly attacks evidence-based medicines; vilifies the pharmaceutical industry; suggests HIV doesn't cause AIDS and antidepressants are behind mass shootings; believes that vaccines are harmful, not protective; claims 5G wireless networks cause cancer; suggests chemicals in water are changing children's gender identities; and is quick to promote supplements to prevent and treat diseases, such as recently recommending vitamin A for measles and falsely claiming children who die from the viral infection are malnourished.",brain_overclocked,2025-05-04T12:41:04,19

"Vitamin A is actually part of the recommended treatment for measles. I’ve treated kids with measles. We used vitamin A as part of the treatment regimen. RFK is still dumb as hell, and the best way to handle measles is prevention, but here are the details:   The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends administering vitamin A to all children with severe measles, which includes those requiring hospitalization. The recommended doses are age-specific: 200,000 IU for children 12 months of age or older, 100,000 IU for infants 6 to 11 months of age, and 50,000 IU for infants younger than 6 months. A third dose should be given 2 to 4 weeks later to children showing clinical signs of vitamin A deficiency.[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends vitamin A supplementation for all children with acute measles to reduce the risk of complications, regardless of their country of residence. The dosing regimen is similar to that recommended by the AAP.[2] Clinical evidence supports the use of vitamin A in reducing measles-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in children with vitamin A deficiency or severe measles. Studies have shown that high doses of vitamin A can decrease mortality and the risk of complications such as pneumonia and diarrhea in children with measles.[3-4]   Edited to add: one of the many problems with RFK is that he has only the most superficial understanding of anything medical or scientific, and he routinely misquotes statistics to support conclusions or recommendations that have little to no basis in the evidence. Vitamin A is an adjunctive therapy that can help reduce morbidity and mortality, particularly in people who are vitamin A deficient. The problem is that he appears to be touting it as a cure. Ascribe whatever motivations you want to that, but regardless, it’s dangerous because it creates the perception that you don’t need to engage in a preventive strategy because all you need to do if you catch measles is pop some vitamins.",TwoTreeBrain,2025-05-04T09:22:14,9
