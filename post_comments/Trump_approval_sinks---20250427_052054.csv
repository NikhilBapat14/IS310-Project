The problem is the collective amnesia and media propaganda which will help JD Vance and others later. This current approval means nothing.,Efficient_Resist_287,2025-04-27T05:27:48,35
The ones that were listed in a plan to fuck the entire country and world that were easy to find before election day? Those policies?  Future generations will at least get to admire the obelisks that mark the former site of dumbfuck island.

"In my mind Trump is the perfect representation of a boomer. Completely unqualified for the job he holds and is overpaid for, narcissistic to a T, and seemingly desiring to burn the world down since he canâ€™t take it with him after death.",Alaskanzen,2025-04-27T09:44:08,6

"The paywall got me ðŸ˜­. Was able to find it elsewhere but not surprising at all. When your policies are terrible and negatively impact the people, theyâ€™ll notice even if some of them are still propagandized into supporting him. The only problem is the approval rating is only linked to him but in reality all of these policies need to be linked to the Republican Party since they are fully allowing and complicit in this nonsense. It needs to continually be highlighted that this is tRump and the REPUBLICANS doing this, not just tRump.",Few_Name7677,2025-04-27T05:52:34,5

"CNN poll has him as the least popular in 70 years. However, that seems to be biased in Trump's favor, as other polls have him the least popular in 80 years",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-27T07:54:11,7
