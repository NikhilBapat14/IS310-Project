Trump will of course fix everything. RFK Jr. will fix everything. Musk and DOGE are fixing everything. There are actually 3 Donald Trump‚Äôs. The real one stays at Mar-a-Lago. Campaign Trump is fake. The Trump that got shot is a different fake.   The Clinton‚Äôs, liberal celebs like Tom Hanks, basically just all democrats, are behind all child trafficking.

"[Scene: The Pearly Gates ‚Äì vast and eternal. The sky above is gray-white, pulsing gently with energy. Saint Peter stands before the gates, not glowing‚Äîbut solid. Ancient. Judgment incarnate. A massive book rests in front of him, bound in time itself. Trump storms toward him, arms wide, voice loud.]  Trump: Alright, let‚Äôs cut the crap. Big moment. Probably the biggest moment in Heaven‚Äôs history. Donald J. Trump, reporting for eternity. Let‚Äôs open the gates.  Saint Peter (voice calm, yet thunderous beneath): You believe this is a coronation. It is not. This is a reckoning.  Trump (snorts): Oh, come on. I was the best president. The economy was booming, borders were strong, people were proud again‚Äî  Saint Peter (voice rising, sharp as steel): Enough.  [Trump stops mid-sentence. The sky darkens slightly. Saint Peter opens the book. Pages turn themselves, the air growing heavy.]  Saint Peter: Donald John Trump, son of Fred, bearer of influence beyond comprehension‚Ä¶ you stand accused not by Heaven, but by your own hand.  You were born into wealth, and used it not to uplift‚Äîbut to crush, sue, and silence.  You lied so often, you forgot the sound of truth. You bragged of assault. You mocked women‚Äôs bodies. You cheated on every vow‚Äîmarriage, oath, country.  You separated children from their parents and left them in cages. Then you smiled for the camera. You denied science while hundreds of thousands died, suffocating. You downplayed a virus and called yourself a victim while others buried their families on FaceTime.  You stood at podiums built on pain, and you laughed. You offered thoughts and prayers, then slashed funding. You inflamed hatred, then disavowed responsibility.  You didn‚Äôt defend the Constitution‚Äîyou tested its limits to serve yourself.  You pardoned criminals who praised you and attacked heroes who spoke the truth.  You claimed faith when convenient. Held a Bible like a weapon. You never prayed. You posed.  Trump (gritting his teeth): You‚Äôre twisting things. I was under attack from day one. They lied about me‚Äî  Saint Peter (cutting in, unrelenting): They reported you. You lied about yourself.  You built a tower of vanity. You sold your name to steaks, ties, vodka‚Äîthen to fear, conspiracy, and cultism.  You told the poor you were their savior‚Äîwhile you stole from their donations. You told the angry they were patriots‚Äîthen sent them to bleed for your ego. You told the world elections were fake‚Äîonly when you lost.  [Peter raises his hand. The gates do not open. Instead, the clouds part behind Trump. From the mist, shadows emerge‚Äîsouls. Dozens at first. Then hundreds. Then thousands.]  Saint Peter: Now, they will speak. Not politicians. Not pundits. The people who lived in the wake of your choices.  [The first soul steps forward. A young child. Her hands are tiny. Her voice is soft.]  Child: I was five. My mother crossed a desert to give me a future. We were taken. I cried for days. I haven‚Äôt seen her since.  [Another steps forward. A nurse in scrubs.]  Nurse: I worked twelve-hour shifts during the pandemic. We begged for masks. You called it a hoax. I held my father‚Äôs hand as he died. Alone.  [A soldier now, helmet in hand.]  Veteran: I fought for a country you used like a brand. You insulted POWs. You called us suckers. You stood under our flag and spat on our sacrifices.  [A teacher speaks next.]  Teacher: You made truth a target. I taught children facts‚Äîwhile their parents called me a traitor because of something you said on Twitter.  [They keep coming. A Black woman. A Muslim father. A trans teen. An undocumented cleaner. A Capitol police officer. A raped woman.]  Saint Peter (voice solemn): You left a trail‚Äînot of greatness, but of harm. Not of leadership, but of grievance and blame. You inspired only those who wished to feel strong by stepping on the necks of the vulnerable.  You were not cast down. You were followed down by the consequences you refused to face.  Trump (no longer shouting, but sputtering): I‚Ä¶ I did good things. I had support. They loved me. They‚Äî  Saint Peter (interrupts, final): They loved the mask you wore. But masks do not enter Heaven. Only truth.  And your truth is this: You weaponized faith. You twisted freedom. You confused loyalty with worship. And when the world needed compassion, you gave it cruelty.  [Peter steps aside. A new path opens‚Äînot fire, not punishment‚Äîworse. An eternity of mirrors. Of silence. Of only himself‚Äîwith no lies left to tell.]  Saint Peter (looking into Trump‚Äôs eyes): This is not Hell. It is what you created‚Äîan empire of isolation. A kingdom of ego, where you are both king and prisoner.  [The souls begin to fade. The sky grows quiet. Trump stands alone, trembling, not from fear‚Äîbut from the sudden, unbearable truth of who he is.]  Saint Peter (final words): You were given every chance to change. And every time‚Ä¶ you chose you.  [Trump, deflated, steps forward. The gates do not open. They were never meant for him. The path behind closes. The world watches no longer.]",oblivionbat,2025-04-10T19:41:39,3

"It occurs to me that it is possible that in the past, many local religious leaders were not necessarily super into religion themselves. In fact, if they had studied the scriptures closely and reasoned with an open mind, most probably saw through the ruse. But they stayed because they understood that not everyone would understand and would be vulnerable to being misled. Maybe that is what it meant to keep your flock safe - not from literal or petty evil but false prophets who were always lurking around to take advantage of the logically vulnerable and in the process, ruin it for everyone. You could expect some semblance of civility from the society if we shared a common morality.     Religion or no religion, we need common morality to base our politics, justice, and economic systems on. A person should not be allowed to die of hunger or disease or lack of housing. Every person should have the opportunity to learn to a certain level. If we can agree about that then we can disagree all about how we get there. But right now, we don't even agree on what's moral vs immoral. Heck, people don't even agree that no one should be getting killed over all this.",No_Barracuda5672,2025-04-11T04:28:27,2

When someone calls themself a thing, but doesn't actually fit the definition of that thing...they lie, to themselves and others   We can respond one of two ways...we can either embrace the lie, changing the definition of the word so that it ""becomes"" true (yet it doesn't really...cause the word is now a different word describing a different thing...it doesn't actually change what the original thing was...).  Or we can call the lie what it is...a lie...and acknowledge the fraud...  I am a Christian...and THIS...is NOT Christianity. These are not Christians. These ppl are NOT fillowing Christ. They are following someone else...worshipping someone else.  To those out there who c this and are disgusted by the behaviour of these ""Christians""...i trust u r smart ppl and hope u r wise, and able to tell that they aren't ACTUALLY followers of Jesus...

I didn't think I'd ever have cause or reason to post this comment. Mind you this thought only came to me recently few days ago maybe circa April 2-6.  Personally I welcome it wholeheartedly! They are going to rewrite the King James Bible (he already sells his own version with I hear the Bill of rights/preamble and the constitution in it) and they (he) will insert a book or 3 and a host of verses that his followers will claim are speaking of him!  You can laugh and jeer and foam at the mouth but when he does it the maga crowd and elite will point to it as devine provenance of his right to rule that will be but another nail in the coffin of democracy!  The issue for Dems/Libs/Progs/Inds is will our leaders sit on their hands (in Hakeem Jefferies case he'll start waving his hands even more erratically) and do nothing and more importantly will we allow our leaders to let themselves be cucked! Or will we recall them and vote them out of office!  Stop making fun of these people and take them seriously.,fringegurl,2025-04-10T15:20:14,-14

"It is how religion *sometimes* goes, for sure, but not all the time.  I've met plenty of lovely people who aren't pushed to be assholes by their faith.      I personally take a stance based on generous, good people I've met who are animated and inspired to good acts towards others based on their religion.   Yes, I could wish and expect that good people can do that sort of work without religion, but I focus much more on the outcome than the specific path that takes you there.      If you're doing good things, awesome.   If you're doing bad things, we can hope to turn your heart or to stop you via social pressure, and legal means.     Of course, it is most galling to be on the receiving end of bad behavior when the perpetrator wraps themselves in the cloak of religious righteousness.   That adds dishonesty and hypocrisy to the direct injury.   Those sorts of religious people, you and I can agree, are the most dangerous and the most harmful to good society.",mjc4y,2025-04-11T11:58:14,1

I recognize that religions as an institution have done great harm and that they've been both active and passively used by others for hurting and oppressing others.   I grew up as a Catholic and I know first hand how bad those guys can be in particular, though the protestant evangelicals are probably more politically toxic to American politics than Rome is.

"I got it wrong -- it wasn't a flash card. It was a small cue card presumably written by the teacher. Quayle sat at the front of the room holding the cue cards. He was to call a kid to the front of the room to write a word on the blackboard as part of a mock spelling bee. He did, the kid wrote potato, Quayle corrected him and had him add an e to the end of the word. The kid did. Later a journalist pointed out to the child that he had been correct in the first place.   Quayle then got dragged in the press and pop culture for it. When it was eventually divulged that the card was misspelled, and it said potatoe on it, people said he should have caught the mistake on the card. Quayle eventually wrote a memoir and called that potato thing one of the worst things he'd ever done. Quayle had several gaffes in his time as VP, but Bush's gaffes 8 years later were much worse, and Trump's today are even more ridiculous.   It was a simpler time. Speaking of which, my husband and I are rewatching The West Wing. It is ridiculous how far our government has descended, how many standards there used to be that don't exist today.
