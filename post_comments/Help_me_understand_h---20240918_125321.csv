"I believe the tax cuts passed in 2018 start expiring next year so there should be a jump in tax revenue during the next four year period separate from any other government action.  Tax increases are generally seen as deflationary so I imagine the combination of those increases with whatever expenditures/decreases she can get through Congress would likely cancel out.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax\_Cuts\_and\_Jobs\_Act#:\~:text=Many%20tax%20cut%20provisions%20contained,tax%20cuts%20expire%20in%202028.",federalist66,2024-09-18T15:26:27,21
"> Im particularly interested in how some of her ideas would play out if she were elected and those polices came to fruition.  Just to be clear, the president doesn't create these programs, just creates political juice, so congress can define them and get them passed.  In the end the details of the plan matter so much.  > She wants to provide up to $25,000 to help home owners with their down payment on a house.  Taken at face value, this would cost $33B to give 1.3m first time home buyers $25k each.  That's assuming that all of them qualify for the program and the program aren't limited in other ways.  As an example, there were 1.2m EVs sold in 2023 and in theory each one might have received $7500 credits which would have cost $9B.  The reality is the tax credit only cost the government $1B in 2023.  Also keep in mind about whom this credit ultimately flows to.  It might seem like the first time home buyer is the big winner, but really it's the person selling them the house.  We say exactly this with EV sales, where the $7500 was more about giving EV manufactures more profit to allow them to build factories.  So if you own the type of house that is attractive for first time buyers, or you're a builder that builds for first-time buyers, expect to see that $25k basically flow your way in reality.  It's to encourage more houses on the market for first-time buyers.  > She wants to cut taxes for the middle class and those with children.  So much will define what she defines as middle class.  To date, Democrats have defined is as not in the top 5% of households, but who knows. The better question is what are the options.  I guess it depends on what you want to happen, but it's all about the same for the economy, probably.  * If they pass something like her plan to replace the Trump tax cuts, then only the top 5% will see their taxes rise.   * If they don't do it, then everyone's taxes will go up.   * If they leave Trumps taxes in place, then we go on like we are now  > She wants to raise minimum wage.   Will do exactly nothing.  I'm in a major metro but a cheap one.  The effective minimum wage here is $14/hour for anyone that can drive to work and stand for 4 hour stretches and of average intelligence.  The minimum wage is a pointless number until 2040 when the boomers start really fading out and the demand for services drops.  > She wants to go after the cost of health care   This is easily what is needed most.  I doubt anyone will succeed, but again, really up to congress.  > cancel 7 billion in medical debt.  That would cost $7B, probably over 10 years, which is the standard way to cost things.  This is pretty small money at the government level.  > Where is all this money coming from  The tax break is the big money.  The rest is not really much at all.",WeldAE,2024-09-18T16:56:09,15
"Here's the thing about money: more money generates more money. Think about it. If I have an extra $20 to spend I probably will. If I visit a local vendor, then they made an extra $20. They can then go spend that $20 with a small retailer who makes that much more and so on. Now add sales tax to the equation. Every transaction loses a small percentage to go to the government. It may be 10%, so the first one is $2, then $1.80, $1.62, etc. That's extra revenue the government makes, which in turn funds programs that ultimately give people more money. If done right, it's a permanent positive feedback loop where everyone keeps making more and more money and inflation kicks in to keep things balanced. (a low inflationary rate is good, as it encourages spending over savings as the held money would depreciate but not the goods purchased. If it was negative or zero, a lot of people would be incentivized to hold more of their money as it naturally appreciates in value over time, which causes a negative feedback loop where less and less money flows in the economy.)  Additionally, trickle down economics is a lie and easily debunked. Employers don't ""create"" jobs, they host and/or facilitate them. Workload creates jobs, as the higher the workload the more likely (and justifiable) an employer is going to be in hiring more people. Customers/clients create workload, as they do business with the employer's company, trading money for goods and services. The more customers there are, the more workload exists, the more jobs are created. When people have jobs, they make money. If they make more money than they need to live, they spend that money, aka become customers/clients. Therefore, when people at the bottom of the economy have or make more money, they spend that money, which flows ***UP*** the economy (as described in the earlier example with the $20).  The US is in an economically precarious position right now. More money than ever is tied up in billionaire pockets and banks are able to ""create"" money by accepting physical cash from people and lending it to other people at the same time without affecting the first person's monetary value (this is why bank runs are so scary, banks can literally run out of money and owe people more than they have). If anything significant or drastic were to happen, such as doubling/tripling the minimum wage, it could affect billionaire and bank money as employers scramble to cover their sudden cost increases (which, honestly would only happen in the red flyover states and in the south cause they're the only ones who haven't implemented a higher minimum wage or have strong enough economies to bring competitive wages significantly higher than the minimum). This would effectively tank the economy, the opposite of the intended effect. This is why some policies like subsidizing housing and cancelling debt is much better for the economy, because it encourages spending without putting employers in danger of not being able to keep up with the changes. The money may have come from the printer initially, but eventually that money is paid back multiple times over when considering all the extra work done in the economy because of it.",kfish5050,2024-09-18T17:54:30,9
A lot of the cost would be off-set by increased tax rates for corporations and the ultra wealthy.

"The national debt is a looming problem. However, her polices are estimated to add at least 50% less to the debt compared to what trump proposes.   It is fine to nitpick her platform. However, it is profoundly dishonest to do this to her when she would be far better for both average people and for the deficit than her opponent.  https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-harris-trumps-tax-spending-plans-affect-us-debt-2024-09-10/  >Trump has said he plans to extend all tax cuts he pushed through Congress in 2017, exempt Social Security and tip income from taxes, and further cut corporate income taxes. >These changes would likely add $3.6 trillion to $6.6 trillion to primary U.S. deficits over 10 years, according to published individual and comprehensive estimates from four budget forecasters reviewed by Reuters: the Penn-Wharton Budget Model, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), the Tax Foundation and Oxford Economics. >Harris' plans, which include expanding the Child Tax Credit, a $6,000 bonus tax credit for newborns, a $25,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit, and no taxes on tips, could reduce deficits by as much as $400 billion or add up to $1.4 trillion to deficits over a decade, the same forecasters calculated.  So, since you are concerned about debt, which is better:  Trump adding $3.6 to $6.6 trillion to the debt   Or  Harris subtracting $400 billion to adding $1.4 trillion to the debt, while having policies that are far, far better for everyday Americans.l?

"Everything you listed increases the amount of spendable income that households have. Spendable income in middle class households is a primary driver of demand, which then increases production, job creation, state sales tax revenue, etc. As for where the money comes from, none of those are necessarily things that get ""paid for."" The housing plan hasn't been released yet - so we just don't know yet; the tax credit portion is obvious, but no details on the $25k yet. Much like the student loan debt, it depends on who owns the debt - discharges by the Department of Education for debt owned by the Department of Education cost $0 (or rather, the costs were paid at the time of issuance). A lot of medical debt has already been written off by the original payee, so this would involve the US government making deals with the debt holders who already don't expect to recover much, so $7 billion in debt isn't *worth* nearly that to pay off where it can't just be discharged. Minimum wage is paid by employers and only impacts federal coffers by increases tax income.    At the end of the day, there are three basic categories: 1) pays for itself, 2) pays back more than the initial costs, or 3) costs money but is beneficial to American households. Budgets are already made up of all three, and getting a good balance can help limit deficit without harming taxpayers and seeing strong economic growth as a result.",valvilis,2024-09-18T16:51:47,3
"It's about scale, right? If candidate A wants to do one thing that costs 10 trillion dollars and candidate B wants to do a ten thousand things that each cost a million dollars, who's actually advocating for a bigger expenditure? Obviously A, right? By an order of several magnitudes. But if you start listing out each of those ten thousand things that candidate B wants, it's going to start appearing like a lot more money. Just because it's a long list, and candidate A's is a short list, by comparison.  And this is true here as well. Trump's proposed tax cuts are, by an order of magnitude, a much bigger hit on our bottom line than everything I've seen Harris propose.  But just to clear up other thing, we actually *can* print more money. In fact we literally print money every year. That's where money comes from. This starts being a problem if people start losing faith in the value of the money printed, which generally is only going to happen if A) we start abusing the system and acting recklessly, or B) people start agitating around the idea that money is worthless. Now, here in the US, we've seen Republicans try to do both A and B here (through ignoring economist's financial predictions, refusing to responsibly handle rate adjustments, allowing or even encouraging federal spending cessation, refusing to honor issued debts, and through general agitation around the idea of irresponsible spending and out of control inflation \[neither of which is happening\]). I can go into more detail here if you want, but I'd rather not just write a small book unprompted.  Asking ""how will we pay for it"", after a specific policy proposal, is totally fair. And I think Harris has done a fair bit of this already, though it's admittedly difficult to get something nuanced like that through in a limited engagement window (such as social media or a televised debate) when your opponent is shouting about eating cats and forced transgender surgeries in prisons.",cossiander,2024-09-18T17:58:23,3

"Harris has actually favored Biden taxes on unrealized gains (stocks, property, inheritance, etc) That is where the money would come from.  The side effect is that with more corporate tax there will be less jobs, stock market shares will decrease in value, some companies will fold, and revenues will eventually decrease again.  Then they just add taxes on the less wealthy, you and me.  We lose with less jobs and tax consequences filter down on all of us.  My view, is that Government really needs to get out of the way of productive corporations and business so they can hire more people and share the wealth through jobs and products.  You know, Government does very little for most people and needs to be cut back substantially.  I get about $70 from social security period, I am not eligible for anything else.  Sounds like a good retirement system huh?  Your best bet is drop Government regulations and allow everyone to accrue assets and wealth.  The $25,000 sounds good to someone who will then have to pay an additional $25,000 in inflated home prices.  If we get out of the way with no regulations, we will have plenty of homes at lower prices, better health care, and better retirement.

"As someone who recently went through the same thing I appreciate that you want to look deeper at everything being said and try to set the bias aside! It’s been quite the journey for me as well but I can say for the first time in my life I changed my voter registration from Republican to Democrat.   The most simple answer is this:   Kamala Harris wants to raise taxes on the ultra wealthy from 21% to 28%, which before 2017 it was 35% so this isn’t extreme, and she plans to take that income to give support to the middle class via these programs that will stimulate buying houses, having children, and opening tons of small businesses.   Donald Trump in 2017 cut the taxes for “everyone” and I say this because the true tax savings were for the top 1%. He plans on cutting taxes even more on corporations from 21% to 15%, costing America 200 billion. He wants to pay for that by blanket tariffs. Which tariffs are paid by the consumer, us.   So in a nutshell he wants to give his rich buddies more money and have us pay for it while Kamala wants to put more back in the hands of the every day person and have the larger income earners pay a bit more to cover it. That is how both of them plan to pay for their proposed policies.   I know I don’t fall in the category that benefits from Trumps plan, I am not a billionaire (unfortunately lol)",glockgirl42,2024-09-25T12:13:19,1
"Why does everyone support Kamala when she has a questionable record?  The media never posts anything bad about her and ABC has a 100% disapproval rating of their content about trump and a 0% disapproval rating for Kamala. When you go on Fox News then you see a lot of different stuff being talked about.  I get that she's the only candidate left and represents ""democracy"" but why do all the news networks have to lie and cover her up to make her better looking? She can barely hold an unscripted interview, you can look up the one she had with Brian Taff and none of the liberal news networks covered it. She wouldn't answer any questions and just repeated her lines from the debate.  Her answer for ""what will you do to help the middle class and better the economy?"" was ""I grew up as a middle class kid with a family that I love very much and I had wonderful friends who worked very hard"". For the record, she was born in Canada next to a university and her father was a successful professor while her mother was in a great role as well. It's up to you guys if that is middle class or not.  In conclusion, she doesn't seem to have any standards for dealing with the problems we're facing, she even endorsed biden's controversial plan to create an app called CBP 1 that lets people come into the US and a lot of gang activity from ""places"" has been reported. They're now fighting with chicago gangs and have setup strongholds all over the country with drug trade and other violent crimes reaching an all time high.  Her inflation reduction act was also never to reduce inflation and Biden admitted recently in public that it was meant for the environment. She also supports gender care for jailed migrants and won't publicly say she doesn't anymore.  Her team also copy and pasted Biden's website text to use for their policies but they said ""she doesn't know what the policies are and needs time to think about them, after election would be possible"". So yea she doesn't know what her policies would be and what you guys are struggling with. Ignores the press and the people and just keeps herself safe from criticism just like her former white house attendees describe her.  Trump is far from perfect but ultimately, you have to admit that this isn't about parties anymore and that the candidate chosen for you isn't all too qualified. You as the people have the power to elect a better choice, biden and harris weren't all too good of a choice in the grand scheme of things and there's no one else.

">Where is all this money coming  This gets complicated quick.  **The US Federal Government can spend more than it makes**   The US Federal Government does not need to break even year to year. Many US cities and states have requirements in their city charter or state constitution with constraints like that, but not the federal government.     **Spending money sometimes makes more money**  A simple example would be building a road. A city paves a road. That cost money. Now people use the road to go to work or to go out and spend money. That generates spending and the local government taxes that (sales tax, income tax). The city could make more in that revenue than the cost of making that road.  Another example is social services spending. Spending money on providing social services often causes a reduction in crime. Reducing crime saves money on a number of fronts for governments. So that spending can pay for itself too.  Another example is job training programs or programs that help people get training (like free pre-k), because if people get more education and then get better paying jobs the government gets a percent of that higher income in taxes. Also higher income means they will likely spend more in the area which can help create demand for new jobs.",thisfunnieguy,2024-10-03T14:13:24,1

"I can’t speak for everyone else on Reddit, but I haven’t asked about Trump because I haven’t looked at his policies in depth yet. I’m doing that next and I’m sure the questions will come. I started with Kamala because I live in a red state and wanted to start with the candidate I might have the most bias against simply because of where I live.  Also, thank you for apologizing.",Floral_Bee,2024-09-19T06:53:58,5
You kinda sound like a douche.  Didn't mean to insult you!,Pseudoknonymous,2024-10-11T10:35:55,2
I am aware that the propoganda and misinformation is out there. I think that is what makes it so confusing for me to process. Our political spectrum is also very polarized. It seems like both sides I talk to take everything personally and project extremest stereotypes on the other side which is actually so harmful from either side. It doesn't help people like me that don't feel strongly in their ability to understand politics and it just hurts our humanity too.   Thank you for sharing these links and subreddits! Im sure they will be a big help to me as I continue on my research XD,Floral_Bee,2024-09-19T09:11:18,5
I can understand the frustration with miss spelling because a lot of conservative people do intentionally misspell or miss pronounce her name to mock or poke fun at her. That wasn't what happened here. I just honestly suck at spelling. 😂,Floral_Bee,2024-10-29T15:53:47,1
"It's cute that you think states' rights still mean something. Abortion is going to be banned federally as soon as he takes office; it doesn't matter what any of us voted for. He's promised to send the military into blue states to round up migrants and punish his enemies. I suggest opening your eyes, like, yesterday.",[deleted],2024-11-07T23:20:29,1
