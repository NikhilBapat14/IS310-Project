Another revenge attack against media en masse. Imagine being such a sour loser that you pull funding for PBS lol. Nevermind the wealth of culture the programs on PBS and NPR provide. AND to be so insecure and backwards that you see those programs as a threat to democracy. What a load of shit.,Mammoth_Royal_2400,2025-05-02T07:02:34,10

Npr hosts drives to get funds from listeners anyway. This would be like taking the 5 dollar allowance away.Â ,rumble_bee,2025-05-02T07:26:02,2
"This move also attacks funding for local NPR member stations, which situationally can be much more impactful, such as for small rural stations.",MajesticSumpPump,2025-05-02T07:34:52,4
