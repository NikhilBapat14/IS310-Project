"As I've been saying, Mother Nature has her own term limits.   If you really want to destabilize MAGA, talk a lot about Trump's possible successors. Few things psychologically undermine a dictatorship like talk of a successor. It's not in the interests of the dictator to remind the public of his or her mortality. That's what much of this Trump third term BS is really all about – the insinuation that Trump will rule forever.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-08T07:51:00,7
"This is the exact scenario a political science professor at the University of Tennessee taught me about ~~forty~~… uuuummm… twelve years ago — a president could evade the two-term limit set by the 22nd Amendment by inserting himself into the line of succession. Remember, the amendment in question says “elected more than twice”, and the line of succession would not count as “elected”.  Now, the obvious counter-argument is that the intent of the 22nd is clearly that two terms is an absolute limit, but I am very confident that this is the plan they envision for allowing Trump a third term.",Maryland_Bear,2025-04-08T06:23:51,6
I strongly believe he will be 6 feet under before he has a chance to run for a third term.,whatisdrugs2823,2025-04-08T17:11:53,2
"There was talk that when he first started mentioning a third term  that the idea was keep Congressional Republicans in line, considering that he is a lame duck President.  So, the thought of a third term is what will keep them loyal.  I mean, the GOP is already considering a post-Trump Party.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T13:01:42,3
"I wouldn’t be surprised in the least if one of his spawn tried to run. Probably Junior since Eric seems slightly less interested in politics. Ivanka is apparently distancing herself from the family a bit, and Tiffany and Barron are too young.   Although the three eldest could all vie for being his successor, which could set up a “*Game of Thrones*, if most of the characters were idiots” scenario. If Ivanka shows riding a dragon, watch out.",Maryland_Bear,2025-04-08T07:58:31,1
"Supposedly when you look at the notes, memos, correspondence, drafts, Congressional debates, etc. it is clear that the intention is that a person can only be POTUS no more than two times regardless of the avenue.    Anyways, the first obstacle is that the Republican duo need to win the election.  The second is that they then willingly step down to clear the way.  I am pretty sure that Vance and Trump don't really like each other and I can see that if it were Vance then he would rather not step down.    Oh, I forgot, this also requires to Trump to win what ever position it is that would put him in line.   Realistically, the way this scenario would play out is if a true Trump loyalist wins and right now that is most likely Don Jr. only.   If it does happen, what I think will happen is that Trump will announce the run and will need to go to the Supreme Court to allow States to put his name on the ballot.  The Supreme Court will either rule in his favor (and thus, in favor of all past and future Presidents -- meaning Obama could also run for a third term), or, the Court will tell him he is nuts and he will decide to just not leave office.   Here is the catch--the GOP is more than aware and are being cautious from allowing anything that would allow Obama a third term.  So that is that.   Realistically Trump would just step down and run the Country from a shadow government.  Honestly, dude would still wield a hellofalot of power by joining a think tank, the Heritage Foundation, or doing it solo.  He would also have a lot more time to golf, which seems to be about the only other thing he cares about besides his name.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:54:54,2
"Sure, but somebody elected as Vice President has to meet the Constitutional qualifications to be President.  What you’d be thinking of is more like “a twice-elected President is not barred from being Secretary of State,” but any ineligible person who happens to be in the line of succession is simply skipped over if that ever comes up — as it has when for instance non-natural born citizens have held Cabinet posts.",tc100292,2025-04-08T19:33:45,1
His spawn have zero charisma.,tc100292,2025-04-08T19:35:49,2
"CPAC straw poll put Vance way ahead of everyone else.  Don Jr was not even mentioned afaik.  But, an earlier poll prior to CPAC placed Don Jr. second behind Vance.   More recent polling still has Vance at the top, followed by DeSantis and then Halely.   Trump has mentioned, what, 2 or 3 times now, that he wants a dynasty and all but says that he wants one of his kids to be the next POTUS.   Ivanka was mentioned early on, like back in January, but I haven't seen her name come up as a serious potential contender since.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T13:07:02,1
"Yeah, the actual play would be to run Don Jr. or whoever and if he wins have Trump be the shadow President similar to what Musk is doing now, and make very explicit that you’re really voting for Trump.",tc100292,2025-04-08T19:35:03,2
