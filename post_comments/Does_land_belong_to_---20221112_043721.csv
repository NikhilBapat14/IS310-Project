"Both. The owner has ownership. The country where it’s located has sovereignty. Depending on the context, either could be described as “the land belongs to X.” If you’re talking about international relations, you’d say the land belongs to the country (as opposed to belonging to some other country). If you’re talking about getting permission to go camping, you’d say it belongs to the owner.",cpast,2022-11-12T16:14:50,24
The government is responsible for defending the legal system that guarantees property rights.,TheLeftHandedCatcher,2022-11-12T17:27:20,4
Depends on the country and its laws regarding property rights.,Yggdrssil0018,2022-11-12T21:54:38,2
What happens if you don’t pay taxes on the land?   That’ll tell you who you owns it.,jawocha,2022-11-13T00:17:40,1
"It also depends on the country in question. Some countries have no private land ownership. Some countries have strong eminent domain laws, some have weak laws. Some countries are in between. Here in the United States, the federal and state governments have almost unlimited powers to seize property, but must legally offer fair compensation. Other countries can seize property, at will with no cost. In some countries, the eminent domain process is difficult in normal situations.",dajuwilson,2022-11-12T20:06:06,4
"This is why governments can use eminent domain to seize your land ""for the good of the people.""",Swiggy1957,2022-11-12T16:48:38,6
"There's actually more people who have ownership claim to land too.  Traditionally (in the US) you have ownership from the center of the earth to the sky, but there are many rights that can be separated from the surface rights:  mineral rights - you can sell the rights to some or all of the substances while you keep the surface rights.  This is how oil rights work  water rights - some commercial properties come with rights to a share of water from certain water sources (riparian rights) or the right of access to an attached body of water (littoral rights)  air rights - you can sell the right to the air above your property.  This is rare outside of big cities but it's being done commonly in NY now.  Also the reason airplanes can pass over your property is Congress has given the rights to manage navigable airways as long as it doesn't substantially impinge on the owner's usage of the property.  So in a sense the FAA / the US controls that portion of the property  Sometimes covenants attached to the property limit how you can use your property.  Maybe through a HOA limiting how you can build on the property.  There's also ""right of ways"" which grant access to others to cross your property.  Sometimes there's a blanket right for the public to cross a property.     Anyways, many people can have a ownership like interest in a piece of property.",EtherCJ,2022-11-13T00:25:50,1
"Yep, individual ""ownership"" means very little if it's not backed up by a robust local/state/federal gov't.",ExpertConsideration8,2022-11-12T19:16:58,2
