"Latino Christians thought Trump was only going to go after “criminal immigrants.”   ""Not all Latino church leaders see allowing raids near places of worship as a negative thing.  ""I don’t think there’s any reason to be afraid,” said Reverend Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference. “This administration is currently 100% focused on tracking down and deporting those involved in criminal activity,” he said.   Rodriguez, who in recent weeks has been invited to the White House as part of the advisory board on faith issues, does admit that it’s possible that people who aren’t involved in criminal activities could be entangled in the raids.  ""If that person is in an environment where there are other undocumented people, unfortunately [federal officials] did share with me that 'you are who you surround yourself with,' and if you don’t have documents, you’re also likely to suffer the consequences of deportation,” the pastor said.""",Kindly_Ice1745,2025-04-07T21:30:57,1
