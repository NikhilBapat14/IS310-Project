"Mmmm, we're not QUITE at the level of the Bay of Pigs yet, but we're certainly taking the express lane towards it . Sincerely, old person who is NOT happy with the small üçÜ dictators waving around their radioactive penis replacements.",Evinrude70,2022-09-23T22:26:20,6
"I was not alive in 1962 and I am not sure how many people old enough to have an adult memory at that point use Reddit.  That being said: We are NOT as close to the United States being in a nuclear war now as we were in October of 1962. Back then, we were VERY close to war and that war could have escalated quickly to nuclear war.   In the Ukraine War you have Russia trying to save face. There extreme goal of taking over all of Ukraine was a total failure and they have since been pushed back. Putin will continue to saber rattle with nukes as a means to keep the Ukraine from pushing into the Donetsk area Russia has had control over. It would be suicidal for Putin to use nukes at this point, there is no tactical value in doing it.   He has to keep a single use strike option if he actually was threatened by a superior conventional force. That is how he could justify it and not face a retaliatory strike.",cincyblog,2022-09-24T07:25:04,6
Now we have up to the minute coverage which ratchets up the pressure as well as an active war with a dictator who already has one foot in the grave and nothing to lose and little to gain.,Carbon_Gelatin,2022-09-23T20:36:38,8
"Today's tensions with nuclear war aren't even remotely comparable to the CMC. Any similarities are superficial at best.  You have to understand, in 1962, the world was less than two decades away from actually using nukes. For the last decade and a half, the strongest militaries in the world were either rushing to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, or were actively testing and developing stronger nuclear weapons. Folks were *talking* about nuclear disarmament, but to date there had been almost zero progress on that idea. The world was in a state where everyone was actively convinced that nuclear calculations were going to be a normal part of warfare for the foreseeable future.  So when Khrushchev moved missiles onto Cuba without warning the US, the US saw that as an aggressive threat, and they were ready to go to war about it. The USSR really never indicated any intention to *shoot* the missiles, or to launch a pre-emptive attack against the US, but the US was not going to permit nuclear missiles that close to the homeland, period.   It's also important to note that at this point, both the military and the public believed nukes had a place in warfare and diplomacy going forward. The military in particular was quite trigger happy during this era, often advising presidents to take aggressive action against the USSR and risking nuclear exchange. The public also showed its trademark subtlety in foreign policy and had a rather large contingent happy to blow away all the communists that threaten the American way of life, particularly when there was a Dem president in office.   Compared to today, it's not even close. The public is still pretty misinformed--there are a LOT of voters that still nuclear warfare would inevitably result in MAD and that's not really been true since the 1960s. But the public's poor information is now skewed *against* nuclear war. Militarily, pretty much no one sees nukes as being all that effective. Sure, they make a big boom, but they cause SO MUCH collateral damage that it undermines literally any military value. For example, if Putin drops a nuke in Ukraine, it will help stop the Ukrainian advance...but it will also take such a drastic step forward that it will basically guarantee a NATO invasion of Russia, which doesn't help Putin at all. And dropping a nuke on territory you want to annex is obviously self-defeating. It's just such a big bad thing at this point that it literally harms your ability to win whatever war you're using it on.  And then there's the changing political calculus. There's a reason basically all international relations experts have dismissed the chances of nukes from the beginning. Basic game theory shows that nukes don't help because of the above reasons. If North Korea *actually* dropped a nuke, it would be the end of their regime. Kim Jong-un might be crazy, but even he can realize that dropping a bomb that would trigger a war he can't win isn't a good idea. Nuclear *threats* can be very effective because if enough people, particularly voters, take the threat seriously it can compel behavior, but *actually* dropping a nuke doesn't help.  But in 1962, people didn't think that way. In 1962, even experts weren't gaming that out and showing how a nuke would only harden resistance against the entity that dropped it. In 1962, it was much simpler: we're in a battle for the soul of mankind, and missiles aren't made of flowers, and nuclear warheads are made to be dropped.
