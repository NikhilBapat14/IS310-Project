"I've been waiting for an official piece from Marc Elias about this. The fact that the courts were giving him deference as if he was sending these lawsuits in good faith. I can't remember if it was Elias or Glenn Kirschner that said the courts have slowly stopped seeing it that way. Considering two judges were arrested, judge Howell wrote a 100+ page smackdown on the administration, judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote a democracy saving opinion on the Garcia situation and what did we get in return? That ass clown Stephen Miller and his group sued John Roberts to take over the courts, on Trump's behalf. Goes without saying but from those second forward, the courts need to treat him as a domestic terrorist.",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-03T12:24:49,327
It's not clear whether the courts don't understand that Trump is not a regular president or whether they're just afraid of him.   But whenever he violates a court order there are no consequences. Nobody gets held in contempt of court. What's the point of even having a court system or lawsuits if that's the case?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-03T13:48:19,76

"The courts are not presuming anything - so far they have been pretty adamant in saying that there is a lot of law-breaking going on. It is just that the options for enforcement are limited. To start using the limited enforcement tools on a lawless admin like this would invite a showdown, which POTUS may be itching for.   Rather, they are waiting for the Legislative branch to do its job. SCOTUS has made clear that the only way to hold a president accountable is politically - either through elections or impeachment.   Perhaps the justices wanted a substantially more powerful presidency. And they've taken the stance that it is on Congress to hold POTUS accountable, not the courts.",onemanclic,2025-05-03T13:56:28,16

I‚Äôm sure this goes into TL/DR territory so maybe I‚Äôm the last person who cares lol‚Ä¶  The problem is the courts and many others are bestowing on him personally the respect that should be given to the office; respect that Trump himself is not bestowing on the office through his disgraceful behaviors. Not saying this to imply I agree with anything he did but Clinton had the dignity to keeps his misdeeds hidden from the public as much as he could like JFK and so many others did. Before ‚ÄúDonny 2 dolls‚Äù no other president would say a cross word about another former president so as to not besmirch the office. Now greedy power hungry buffoons found out regular Americans reached a point where they hate all politicians enough they could weaponize that as long as they made them feel like they were hating together like a pack of middle schoolers cheering on the bully out of fear and envy of the smart kid getting bullied.,RudeAlarm,2025-05-03T21:46:10,0

"You‚Äôre either a Bot or a Clown, equally as useless either way.  ‚ÄúSedition is overt conduct, such as speech or organization, that tends toward rebellion against the established order.
