>The Palisades Nuclear Plant will be the first restart of a commercial nuclear reactor in the U.S. It ceased operations after 50 years in May 2022 by then-owner Entergy.  Does anyone know why the plant ceased operations in 2022? The article doesn't say.,Farmwife64,2025-04-28T18:38:09,64
"Microsoft is paying to have the shut down reactor at Three Mile Island brought back up to speed, then MSFT will pay for and take basically its capacity to run an AI Data Center.  A.I. needs mega-giga, super big, huge power.  I think AI may require we finally, as a species, get our heads out of our asses and go nuclear.",cliffotn,2025-04-28T18:55:31,208

It's a shame we lost the technology for how to build these. /s,synn89,2025-04-28T23:00:25,2
This is all good and all but where is the power going to be linked to?  Example….the fermi station on Lake Erie (in Monroe Michigan) sends its power to Pennsylvania….great for them ….sucks for Michigan..  I’d much rather see states generating their own power for their own residents but dte is greedy as hell no matter what their tear jerking commercials proclaim.,tsoxiko,2025-04-29T20:49:46,1
The original company that sold it to the current one cited mechanical issues and financial viability according to other articles.    So a viable company willing to make the necessary repairs should be able to facilitate a healthy restart.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-28T19:07:41,53
Is Microsoft paying for the permanent storage of the waste?  How do they propose to do it?  EDIT: He blocked me.  Beware people like this that are here to sell you something.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-28T22:48:32,-30
"An energy independent U.S. can't be blackmailed into going to war against its own interests, nor can it be economically coerced. That's why the left hates energy independence now. They are simply siding with the enemy.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-29T03:35:43,12

Well the reactor is literally in the same plant that had the largest nuclear accident in USA. Still no fatalities but that containment building will be sealed for decades.,dankhorse25,2025-04-29T00:17:41,7
"Ah. I was wondering if it had something to do with needed maintenance/repairs or upgrades. The plant is over 50 years old.  It looks like the operator has been granted a pretty hefty loan from the DOE, up to $1.52 billion.  >Holtec International, which operates the nuclear facility located on Lake Michigan, in Van Burean County’s Covert Township, received the third loan installment of $46 million of up to $1.52 billion from the Department of Energy marked for the reopening.   Hopefully, all goes well.",Farmwife64,2025-04-28T19:23:48,15
"The amount of waste is minor all nickear waste produced in the us since the 40s can fit in a football field with room to grow. More important before obama, Gates was working with another company to engineer safeties into nuclear to prevent every known way of meltdown with automatic shutdown safties. It was in testing when obama banned new nuclear.  They are likely reviving that project. They even have uses for depleted rods to power small pumps for places like Africa to pump water ftom the ground.",RightforRights,2025-04-28T23:31:44,34
They’re switching over to thorium based not uranium. There’s no waste with those. Can even build them in a desert with no water,ManasZankhana,2025-04-28T23:09:43,18

"Ah.  So it's another of those cheerleading posts where we need to ""get our heads out of our asses and go nuclear"" without any consideration for who's paying for it.  How very conservative.  So our existing plants are stuffed full of waste that they've kept on-site since the dawn of nuclear power because not only is there no plan for how to store it for the wild amount of time it has to be stored for, but also that there's no way to actually pay to store it for that long.  The profit made from running a plant doesn't even begin to cover what it will cost to store, monitor, and secure it over that kind of time.  All these plant operators are hoping to make their profit and eventually walk away, leaving the debt to you.  New plants shouldn't be allowed to open unless they're willing to put the money up front to manage the waste and have a viable plan for it.  If they're unwilling to do so, it lets you know they were planning to scam the public, essentially taking out a massive loan on many, many future generations that they'll walk away from.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-28T23:31:41,-24
Perfect is the enemy of good.  We need to finally open Yucca Mountain (or the equivalent) for storage and get modern nuclear going nationwide to ensure energy independence.,Jaegermeiste,2025-04-29T00:30:28,16

">Perfect is the enemy of good.  Well we have neither, currently.  We have companies that have created an unimaginable debt to make profit, and are looking like they'll be walking away from that debt, leaving it to the taxpayer.  >We need to finally open Yucca Mountain (or the equivalent) for storage  Ok, so, who pays for it?  It's not something where you dump waste down a hole and walk away, it will need monitored, maintained, and secured for longer than human history.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-29T00:38:19,-12
">Ahh, so another wall-o-text I’m not gonna read.  Good to know you're just here to promote and not converse.  >So you weren’t actually asking a question, you were trying to pick a (lame AF) Internet fight.  My marketer sense was tingling with ""I think AI may require we finally, as a species, get our heads out of our asses and go nuclear."" and I figured you'd have no answer to what the costs involved with this are.

"Who pays for the crappy polluting oil and coal plants we have now? Or the renewable?  It's just another mode of power, it's not like the financing is some insurmountable barrier (NIMBY lawsuits aside, perhaps).",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-29T00:58:36,17
">Who pays for the crappy polluting oil and coal plants we have now? Or the renewable?  The cost to manage the waste of these is a problem, like fly ash ponds where companies are generating a mess they don't know what to do with and intend to walk away some day and leave it to you to discover that there was no long-term plan.  Nuclear is on a whole different level of this, though.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-29T01:59:06,0
