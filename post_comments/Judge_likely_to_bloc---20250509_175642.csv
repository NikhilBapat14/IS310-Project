This needs to stop.   He needs to be stopped.   We can’t continue waking up/coming home to 10 stories like this every day. Nobody’s gonna tell him or enforce anything. The courts are trying. But we can’t do this anymore. Between him and this outrageous administration…we’ve had enough.  I don’t know what it’s gonna take but…this can’t go on. Meanwhile our lives are still going on in the midst of all this.,jl56649,2025-05-09T18:06:54,49

Yeah man fuck this. I didn't sign up for this (I did not vote for this president 3 times) and nor do I think any chaos like this helps a country. This is fucking dumb.,Beneficial_Tour9487,2025-05-09T20:19:13,12

"Yes. I knew he was a conniving snake before he came down that escalator the first time. But each day is a new low, even for him. I have to change the channel now especially when I see him, Pam Bondi or that press secretary. They make me sick.",jl56649,2025-05-09T20:27:56,5
