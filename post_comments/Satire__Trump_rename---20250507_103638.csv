"But 'San Andreas' is Spanish.  And the fault is invading from Mexico.  So yeah, renaming to Joe Biden's Fault checks out.         Yes.  I understand the meaning of the word 'satire'.",crucial_geek,2025-05-07T12:30:05,1

"Maybe Texas needs to be renamed as well then....   Excerpt from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas  The name Texas, based on the Caddo word t√°y:sha º (/t…ôÃÅjÀê Éa î/) 'friend', was applied, in the spelling Tejas or Texas,[14][15][16][1] by the Spanish to the Caddo themselves, specifically the Hasinai Confederacy.[17]  During Spanish colonial rule, in the 18th century, the area was known as Nuevas Filipinas ('New Philippines') and Nuevo Reino de Filipinas ('New Kingdom of the Philippines'),[18] or as provincia de los Tejas ('province of the Tejas'),[19] later also provincia de Texas (or de Tejas), ('province of Texas').[20][18] It was incorporated as provincia de Texas into the Mexican Empire in 1821, and declared a republic in 1836. The Royal Spanish Academy recognizes both spellings, Tejas and Texas, as Spanish-language forms of the name.[21]",D-R-AZ,2025-05-07T13:00:26,2
"The Gov of Illinois did a video making fun of Don.  He announced that he was changing the name of Lake Michigan to Lake Illinois, and to coincide with Tr\*mp buying Greenland, he was going to buy Green Bay.  My mother and several of her friends bought it, and still do.  I don't think I can post vids in here but it should be really easy to find on Google.",tinyE1138,2025-05-07T17:09:07,2
