"Secretaries of state oversee elections and work with local elections offices. Treasurers run the financial departments of their states, collecting taxes and doing budget work. Attorneys general are the states' top lawyers, in charge of state law enforcement and state prosecutors. Comptrollers I believe are kinda like treasurers but are usually at the city level.  While the federal government does a lot of governing, states do probably more governing. That makes state positions very powerful/important, so it's worth doing a little research on each of the candidates before you vote (check the voter's pamphlet). In Oregon for example, the governor, treasurer and secretary of state make decisions together on state timber sales (where to cut, how much to cut).",ArchdukeAlex8,2022-11-08T17:54:42,1
Arizona is the only state with an elected state mine inspector. Mining is a huge component of our economy and it was put into place back in the day to offset the influence of powerful mining companies who were trying to engage in corruption by getting their own inspector appointed who would look the other way.  The office of the state mine inspector ensures that safety requirements are met inside the mining industry.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-11-08T17:58:30,1
"Other people will better explain the various down ballot positions than I can. Most of these roles are pretty similar to what they do at the federal level, just for the state or city.   But as to why they should be partisan, you've actually got it backwards. Local races where you've got very limited information on the office or candidates are exactly where party labels are most useful. The problem with these races is that they do real work, and have real important responsibilities, but they are also relatively minor. They don't get a lot of media coverage, and they don't have very big budgets for campaigns, so most voters only learn the about who all is on the ballot once they have the ballot in front of them, even if they're pretty darn informed on the process.   This is the benefit of a party. If someone is a Democrat, I *mostly* know the broad principles they stand for. No one is a perfect robot, so certainly there is some variation, but overall, if someone's a Dem or a Rep, I could probably pick out a good portion of the policies they support before I know anything about them. This is a very good thing, because it's a LOT of effort to know deeply the details of every single candidate on my ballot, especially local races that have a somewhat less meaningful impact on my life.  For example, the state comptroller does budget stuff. I have no idea who were the people running for that in my race. I think I got one mailer from one candidate, but other than that, I saw NOTHING about it. I didn't see a single campaign speech, a single flyer, a single anything other than that one mailer. But if I know one of my options is a Dem and one is a Rep, then I can assume that one will be more willing to embrace public spending than the other, and I can probably infer on what issues. That is VERY important to me.   In short, remove party identification and voters have LESS information to make their decision. It requires them to do a massive amount of additional homework, and we *already* have a voter information problem to begin with. And what is the benefit? The ones most likely to buck the party trends are folks who have long periods of incumbency at the higher levels of the party. Guys like Larry Hogan or Joe Manchin, etc. That's in part because they have a large degree of name recognition and a national platform to make their contrarian case. But a smaller local official doesn't have that ability, and they tend to cleave much closer to the party line. Notice, for example, how when Trump was trying to take over the Rep party, he was only really able to do so because he had state-level party members mostly on his side. The ones mostly refusing to bend the knee were long tenured federal electeds like Pat Toomey.",mormagils,2022-11-09T08:46:59,1
Thanks for the response. I guess I'm wondering what makes a role something that we need to vote on rather than be appointed.,FrankieLovie,2022-11-09T09:13:23,2
"Ah, that's a very interesting and good question. I would agree with the perspective that appointing more and electing less, in our current format, might be a net positive reform. I've made that case before in regards to specific offices in my district.",mormagils,2022-11-09T09:20:04,1
