"Interestingly, his strong approval rating among Republicans is 60%, the same margin that he won the primary by.

Literally deporting 2 & 3 year olds and people are still alright with it.  Anyone who still supports Trump needs to be watched closely and judged for it. They are defending the indefensible.,AwkwardBet7634,2025-04-27T04:33:45,1
There is not a lot to be positive about right now. The current Trump ‚Äúsupporters‚Äù are the ones who haven‚Äôt yet had their leopards-ate-my-face moment under this administration.  It‚Äôs not affecting them directly ‚Ä¶ yet ‚Ä¶ or they are too stupid to see how it affects them. And even when it does these morons will *still* blame Biden.,coreychch,2025-04-27T04:39:05,1
