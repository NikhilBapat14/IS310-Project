"> The law allows Washington’s strip clubs to sell alcohol for the first time since 1975, which advocates said would make the establishments safer by allowing them to monitor customers’ drinking, and by making clubs less reliant on dancers as their sole sources of revenue. The law also caps so-called leasing fees that clubs can charge strippers, eliminates “back rent” — debt dancers accrued if they didn’t earn enough during a shift to pay off their club’s fees — and mandates clubs hire security on-site.  > Yet, since January, when the law fully went into effect, some clubs across Washington have opted instead for a “revenue share” model that is not subject to the same restrictions on leasing fees.  > Some club owners have said the model — in which they pay strippers a share of revenue collected from the customer rather than dancers paying fees to establishments to work there — is a legal way to stay afloat after the new law made running their businesses more expensive. The state so far has found clubs using this model to be in compliance with the law.  > But a growing number of strippers, including Keevy and Zack-Wu, say clubs are using the model to continue unfairly profiting off their labor. They are calling on state lawmakers to pass an amendment to the law that would further protect their earnings.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-04T22:36:01,13
