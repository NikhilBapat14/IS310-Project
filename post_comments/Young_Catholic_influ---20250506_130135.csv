You can't be Catholic and MAGA. You can't openly defy the Pope and claim you're a better purveyor of Scripture than thousands of Jesuit priests. You can't poo poo two thousand year old traditions in order to suit your hate.   This is MAGA trying to co-op Catholicism and I hope the next Pope is a radical leftist. ,Blablablaballs,2025-05-06T13:07:03,39

"Are we talking about the same child molesting purveyors of scripture that the Catholic Church continues to protect?  There's few things more MAGA than diddling kids and then blaming the gays. Sounds like they'll get along great.  Remember, abortion can get you excommunicated from the church but any priest can forgive child molestation in the confessional for a few months of extra hail Marys on Sunday.  Can you imagine how many people would be excommunicated just for this alone if the Church had any kind of moral compass?",yoshilurker,2025-05-06T13:24:15,2
The first thing religion teaches is to stop any sort of critical thinking and just accept with the religious leaders say. The second thing it teaches is how to do mental gymnastics so they don’t pull anything with all the necessary hypocrisy just to follow their leader. Those are perfect qualities for MAGAts.,AmrokMC,2025-05-06T13:10:50,1

Are you gonna pretend that the clergy didn't bend over backwards to hide that behavior **from their own parishioners?** It's almost like they knew that every lay Catholic was very much not okay with it.,Good-Gold-6515,2025-05-06T13:38:49,3
Catholicism and particularly the previous Pope very much emphasize social justice.  That mission is opposite of MAGA. ,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-05-06T13:28:18,5
"That's actually not what Catholics do. At age 14-15 their kids start confirmation classes where they learn the history of the church including all the schisms, the actual dogma of Catholicism like transubstantiation and the sanctity of life, and then those kids are asked to make a free and informed choice about whether they want to be confirmed Catholic. That's better than just about any protestant denomination I can think of. American Catholics are uniquely defiant of the Pope and many Catholic doctrines, especially the converts.",Good-Gold-6515,2025-05-06T13:43:06,3
"You're redirecting my argument.  I'm replying to the idea that you can't be MAGA and Catholic because the Pope's church and its purveyors of scripture are a higher authority than MAGA.  My point is that those same (and their employer) that OP is putting on a spiritual and moral pedestal are the same as MAGA. Because evidence shoes is that in reality child molestation is only bad if you risk getting caught and making the organization look bad.  It is only because superior secular laws and based on modern morality that the Church still isn't moving pedos around right now, or more realistically less than it used to. The Church globally has done everything it can to prevent and undermine accountability on this topic.  Thus, any claim that the Church is in any way superior MAGA is silly. Same shit, different team.",yoshilurker,2025-05-06T13:56:14,0

"It's a completely different moral framework and level of inflicted suffering but go off, I'm not Catholic.",Good-Gold-6515,2025-05-06T13:58:28,1
"Your point is valid, but just not super relevant to my argument because I wasn't focused on the lay people. Across all religions we see that beyond the core 20-30% base of true believers, most favor accountability for the Church and pedo priests (these numbers are usually far lower for Evangelicals and their own churches).  You're also right that they are different moral frameworks. But in d2d practice they share a ton of overlap on their moral attitudes towards modern society.  This is especially true for the US Church. Francis did his best, but I think we should be realistic that if the US Church could, it would be 100% about ICE Jesus.
