"Imagine using federal power to investigate… inclusive education. That’s the fight now? Not healthcare, not infrastructure — but “woke” schools?",-Serene_Soul-,2025-04-22T07:23:42,11
“Investigating”?  Being “woke” isn’t illegal and private universities have no obligation whatsoever to follow Trump’s EOs.  Trump can go fuck himself along with all his supporters.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-22T08:35:50,2

"Sex based leagues are intended as competitive levels.  Women have played on ncaa men’s teams in football, basketball, swimming, and baseball. This is because those individual athletes were and are most competitive as women participating in the men’s leagues.  Girls regularly play on boys teams at the high school and younger levels. Primarily in football and wrestling.  Roughly between 100-200 girl athletes in each US state play on boys teams. This is because these girls were and are most competitive as girls participating in the boys leagues.  Women and young adults after a sex change are no longer competitive in the women’s and high school girl’s leagues, men and young adults after a sex change are no longer competitive in men’s and high school boy’s leagues. All athletes are placed in the leagues that are most competitive for them.   It is up to the governing bodies of a sport, the leagues, the schools and organizations, the teams, the coaches, and the athletes to determine where athletes need to participate in order to compete.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-22T08:28:12,-1

I honestly don’t understand why people are getting so worked up about high school and college sports.  It’s a stupid game that doesn’t matter at all.  All sports are.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-22T08:38:24,5

"Sports don’t matter any more than video games do.  The correct response to the right getting worked up is to ridicule them for crying about something silly, not engage with them as if it were a serious matter.  Human rights matter.  Sports don’t.",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-22T08:48:05,2
"Cool. Lets ban trans people from all school athletics, they will also have to use the bathroom assigned to them at birth, they have to wear the uniforms or clothes assigned to them at birth. Hair styles and makeup etc. They will also be sent to social skills training as part of their iep because of their mental illness.   My comment did not raise athletics to the basic tenants of human rights, education, health care, fair trial, no torture. However, participation in athletics is protected by free speech. So they are a basic human right as part of free speech.  Again, I’m not treating athletics as the highest cause. But make no mistake, participation in sports is part of one’s freedom of association and is protected under freedom of speech, and that is a basic human right.   My comment is my canned response to this right wing nonsense.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-22T09:33:44,0
"I'm not sure how any of that follows what I said.  The issue for the right isn't women not being able to participate, it's that trans-women occasionally compete on the same teams as biological women.  Nobody's rights are being violated in ""woke"" schools.  Denying trans people the right to be trans is absolutely violating their civil rights.    When I say sports don't matter, what I mean is that it doesn't matter if once in a blue moon a trans woman has an ""unfair"" advantage being on a women's team, because who wins or loses a sports game has absolutely no impact on real life (especially in high school).  Besides, there are biological women who have just as much an ""advantage"" as a trans woman due to their own genetics making them taller or stronger than most women the boxer from the last Olympics that everyone on the right was sure was trans is a clear example of this).  Should they be banned from women's sports as well?  I thought the right was against the idea of ""participation trophies"".  If anything, having a tougher opponent should be encouraged because it will make the kids train harder to compete and will teach them that life isn't always fair.  Isn't that something the right loves to say anyway?",ProfessionalCraft983,2025-04-22T10:19:17,0
Yeah I’m done talking to you. Didn’t read your comment. You’re on a tangent unrelated to anything I said.,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-22T12:28:20,-2
