They make a very small number of cars that are super luxury.""   Weren't MAGA celebrating few weeks ago that Rolls Royce was going to open a factory in the US?

We're talking about like 1000 cars so a 10% tariff would be like $50MM?  That's not even pocket lint.  Although I don't see much harm in charging that.  Their customers would pay it.  Also, not like the US has alternatives to RR.  Those people aren't also shopping for Cadillacs and if they were assembled in Alabama, nobody would want them.",Lakerdog1970,2025-05-09T08:10:02,1

"The Rolls Royce aerospace company is not the car company.   Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a subsidiary of BMW. They make rolls Royce cars, this is where there is a tariff exclusion.    Rolls Royce Holdings PLC is an aerospace and defence company. They make jet engines amongst other things. They also do submarines and nuclear reactors.

"They do promote it but not in usual consumer channels, their car line doesn’t really do adverts much and has a very niche customer base who don’t need bombarding with info (and tbh it’s pretty small-fry), whereas selling airplane engines is more about lobbying firms and soft diplomacy, cos nobody is watching tv and suddenly sees an aircraft engine advert and goes aircraft engine shopping, whereas once you are the engine of choice for a particular plane, you’re locked in so long as supply goes smoothly.",Blue_winged_yoshi,2025-05-09T08:53:33,2
