"""He got to ask the first question, too.""

I watched today's briefing. There's definitely a trend toward propaganda.  Most of the seasoned reporters typically ask pointed questions with maybe a brief single sentence wind-up for context. This guy spouted off at least 2 paragraphs before actually asking a question.  Leavitt also did a somewhat unusual thing of introducing him as a conservative commenter and basically gave him free advertising.,Boomshtick414,2025-04-28T18:50:07,6
