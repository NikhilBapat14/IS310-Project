"I'm not sure there actually is a benefit, I've heard people argue that there is one but I've never found their arguments to be convincing, mostly their arguments centered around securing trade or the status as the world's most common reserve currency or something, most of which would've happened anyways imo simply due to the size of the US economy.  Part of the reason the US spends so much on the military is political; there's strong bipartisan support for military spending, and politically the average american voter tends to support military spending, and be upset about cuts in it, even though americans are under no actual threat from anything.  The very notion of fear is still enough to make them scared and favor spending.  Also the military is in ways a welfare program, with the industries for it carefully spread out all over the country, so that cutting spending means major job losses in some communities.  Some of it is also a legacy from times during the Cold War, when there was some, at least arguable, value to being able to protect areas from getting invaded.",zlefin_actual,2023-06-28T20:05:54,1
