">State Sen. Jason Pizzo, who recently proclaimed the Florida Democratic Party “dead” before leaving the party, said Friday he will run for governor as an independent in 2026.  So he just cut himself off from Democrat funding, to run for governor in a traditionally Republican state, as an independent? Good luck with that...",pragmatichokie,2025-05-10T13:32:25,1
"As a Floridian, I'm not sure why the hell he did this (polls showed that had he stayed a Democrat and contested the primary, he easily beat Cava, Jolly-who the Dems seemingly plan to coronate-Graham and anyone else), but this basically blows the knees out Jolly's already small chances against anyone not named Matt Gaetz.  There's two likely outcomes I can see happening to Pizzo specifically:  1. John Morgan launches his own independent/third party campaign, likely cannibalizing Pizzo in the process and causing him to end up in the low single digits.  2. John Morgan backs Pizzo and he ends up getting high single digits, maybe cracking 10%.  There's also the possibility Morgan just stays out or that Pizzo doesn't end up cannibalized by him, in both cases ending up with low mid-single digits on Election Night, but neither seems likely to me.  In any case, I hope I'll back whoever the Democrats nominate, especially assuming its Jolly (although I don't want him coronated, not with him polling at 10% and less in the primary).",IvantheGreat66,2025-05-10T13:26:13,1
