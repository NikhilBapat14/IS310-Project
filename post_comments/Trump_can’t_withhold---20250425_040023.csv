"A federal judge just ruled that Trump can't cut off federal funding to sanctuary cities. The judge, William Orrick, said the administration doesn't have the power to punish cities that don't fully cooperate with immigration enforcement. Only Congress can attach strings to federal money — not the President.  This decision is a big win for places like San Francisco and Seattle, which were at risk of losing billions in federal funding. These cities argued that pulling funds would hurt public safety and damage trust in local law enforcement.  It’s not the first time Trump has run into legal trouble over immigration policies, and it probably won’t be the last. The administration says it’s still focused on putting Americans first — but this ruling puts a serious roadblock in their plans.",No_Wrangler8493,2025-04-25T05:03:47,66

""" 'Trump can't do X.', says judge. "" is such a worthless statement. He’s been getting away with shit that judges say he can’t do for years now, because no one has the balls to actually enforce what these toothless paper tigers say.",d0ntst0pme,2025-04-25T07:15:18,26

"The federal government has its own law enforcement officers to enforce federallaws.  All ""sanctuary cities"" are doing is saying they'll follow the law and give any mandatory help to the federal government,  but if federal government wants anything beyond that then they're going to have to bring a probable cause warrant.",aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-04-25T11:32:49,1
Without sanctuary cities illegal immigrants who commit crime can’t be safe… this is hatred towards trans people first and foremost.,Suspicious_Skirt_500,2025-04-25T09:11:15,-2

"Not really, once feds start violating the court's authority they lose legitimacy. FBI agents just become criminal gang members. Given Trump's quickly declining approval ratings, I'd say most Americans feel this way.",findingmike,2025-04-25T11:41:44,1
"If he withholds money illegally, the states can withhold money and so can citizens. See how long the federal government survives without income. You'd see red states fall apart first since they need the money most.",findingmike,2025-04-25T11:43:43,1
">For some reason this feels different this time. It’s gotten really bad, yes, and only silver people are protesting and trying to do something.  That's because everyone else is broke as fuck and has no time to spare - everyone is either living paycheck to paycheck or is so monied they feel insulated from all of this.",YourFreeCorrection,2025-04-25T09:27:55,13

"I was a little surprised that the protest on the 19th was...not particularly substantial, at least in comparison to the one earlier in the month at Seattle Center.   I'll be a little curious to see what all happens on May Day.",nightmareonrainierav,2025-04-25T14:37:55,2
"What do you mean ""not really""? They lost legitimacy the minute Patel became the head of the FBI, Gabbard became the Director of National Intelligence, and FBI agents associated with the classified docs case were ousted. Where are the contempt orders? Who's actually holding Trump and the administration accountable and ENFORCING the law? You people keep talking about approval ratings this and public sentiment that in the midst of an authoritarian coup as if the rules still apply; it's mind boggling to me.",SN8KEATR,2025-04-25T11:59:28,5

"The loss of legitimacy is in the eyes of each person affected by each Republican action. It doesn't happen all at once. It happens when you read an article about a judge getting arrested or a child taken away. It happens when you see ICE kidnap someone.  Right now we see groups of citizens sometimes resisting authorities. Eventually that changes to violence. Things will just get harder and harder for Republican's to enact their policies as more people are repelled by the legal violations of the Trump administration.  Sure it would be nice if we all just suddenly decided we had enough and tossed Trump out. But that opportunity was in November, we decided we wanted to do it in hard mode instead.",findingmike,2025-04-25T12:56:22,2
"[The 5th was pretty sizable.](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-protest-calls-on-trump-musk-to-keep-hands-off-programs/) the 19th, I think there were a few neighborhood- and town-specific events, but the one I swung by at Central CC looked like a couple hundred (hey, better than nothing!) around 2pm or so. Didn't really seem as heavily advertised by flyers and the like around town.  I know the last few years there's been some pretty huge May 1 turnout during the various daytime rallies, and the evenings have been pretty peaceful. Here's hoping we continue that.",nightmareonrainierav,2025-04-25T16:24:30,2
