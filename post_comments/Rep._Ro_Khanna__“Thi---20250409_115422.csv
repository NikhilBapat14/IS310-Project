"Dumb people will never understand that a service can be more valuable than a manufactured good (and typically is), and that we profit and benefit tremendously from controlling the service side of the equation and using other countries for the manufacturing side.  Republicans don’t have the intellectual capacity to extrapolate business beyond whatever physical objects are directly in front of their moronic faces… if it takes a minute level of conceptualizing, they throw in the towel to “own” us with “libtard.”",YurtMcnurty,2025-04-10T23:32:13,1
