Poised to Cancel Grants to Study Dangers to Children](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/climate/epa-cuts-forever-chemicals-grants.html?searchResultPosition=4)” (front page, April 22):  >What an extraordinary juxtaposition of articles on the front page!  >On the one hand, President Trump wants to encourage larger families (“I want a baby boom”), including a proposal to give $5,000 cash bonuses to mothers of newborns (child support that in itself would be supported by Democrats like me).  >On the other hand, in the adjacent article we learn that the administration is set to cancel tens of millions of dollars in grants to scientists studying environmental hazards faced by children in America, especially in poor and rural areas, such as pesticides, poor air quality and “forever chemicals.”  >Mr. Trump’s hypocrisy is clear.

The calculus is very simple. They win non college educated whites and so they want more of them.   Their corporate overlords want cheap labor. They also get that.,hamiltonisoverrat3d,2025-05-02T14:18:28,4
"George Carlin as relevant as ever:  >In the footage from his 1996 HBO special, “Back In Town,” Carlin tears into the pro-life movement:  >“Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to 9 months. After that, they don’t wanna know about you. They don’t wanna hear from you. No nothing! No neonatal care, no daycare, no Head Start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing. If you’re pre-born, you’re fine, if you’re preschool, you’re fucked.”",R_Lennox,2025-05-02T19:02:03,3
"They’re trying to take us back to the depression era. So, ensuring the populace is so poor and unhealthy having a bunch of kids on the idea that a few aren’t going to make it, is really the only way to make your family work.

"So true! He, and that quote IS very relevant, as ever!  It's  kind of pathetic that I've used the GIF with him saying""“Boy, these conservatives are really something, aren't they?"" but never knew the rest of what he said!",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T19:31:17,2
