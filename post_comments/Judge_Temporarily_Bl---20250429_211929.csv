"""Representatives for the plaintiffs praised the decision. “You cannot stop people based on how they look,” said Elizabeth Strater, a national vice president of United Farm Workers, a labor union. “This ruling upholds the basic standards of law in the country.”",Lebarican22,2025-04-29T21:20:17,9

The president has immunity. Federal employees and military do not. U.S. citizens are outside the scope of the job description for border patrol, ICE, customs and military, so any arrest is kidnapping in addition to a civil rights violation. There may be no statute limitations on some of the crimes.",nanoatzin,2025-04-29T21:35:48,8
"""Gregory K. Bovino, a Border Patrol chief in Southern California, described the operation at the time as an “overwhelming success.” He said in a series of social media posts that it had resulted in the arrests of 78 people who were in the country illegally, including a handful with “serious criminal histories.”  Advocates for farmworkers, however, said that many of those detained had no criminal records and that the raids had terrorized immigrant communities.  In February, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the federal government on behalf of United Farm Workers and five Kern County residents, claiming that Border Patrol agents stopped and arrested individuals regardless of their immigration status or individual circumstances.  The order granting the preliminary injunction cited public data from Border Patrol stating that of the 78 people arrested during the operation, 77 did not have a criminal or immigration history that was known before their arrest.""",Lebarican22,2025-04-29T21:52:46,3
