The U.S. population being less educated means there will be more Trump supporters.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-02T14:56:32,59
What a joke. Woke has just become the new word he calls anything he disagrees with but who needs science when they have QAnon and Flat Earthers to tell them what to believe.,Haileysee,2025-05-02T14:57:45,30
">In keeping with the administration's attacks on research agencies and the places research gets done, research funding will be taking an enormous hit, with the National Institutes of Health taking a 40 percent cut and the National Science Foundation losing 55 percent of its 2025 budget. But the budget goes well beyond those highlighted items, with nearly every place science gets done or funded targeted for cuts. > >Perhaps even more shocking is the language used to justify the cuts, which read more like a partisan rant than a serious budget document. > >... > >US science couldn't flourish without an educational system that funnels talented individuals into graduate programs. So, naturally, funding for those are being targeted as well. This is partially a function of the administration's intention to eliminate the Department of Education, but there also seems to be a specific focus on programs that target low-income individuals. > >For example, the GEAR UP program describes itself as ""designed to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education."" The OMB document describes it as ""a relic of the past when financial incentives were needed to motivate Institutions of Higher Education to engage with low-income students and increase access."" It goes on to claim that this is ""not the obstacle it was for students of limited means."" > >Similarly, the SEOG program funding is ""awarded to an undergraduate student who demonstrates exceptional financial need."" In the OMB's view, colleges and universities ""have used [it] to fund radical leftist ideology instead of investing in students and their success."" Another cut is claimed to eliminate ""Equity Assistance Centers that have indoctrinated children."" And ""The Budget proposes to end Federal taxpayer dollars being weaponized to indoctrinate new teachers."" > >In addition, the federal work-study program, which subsidizes on-campus jobs for needy students, is also getting a billion dollar cut. Again, the document says that the states can pay for it. > >... > >This budget is a recipe for ending the US' leadership in science. It would do generational damage by forcing labs to shut down, with a corresponding loss of highly trained individuals and one-of-a-kind research materials. And, at the same time, it will throttle the educational pipeline that could eventually replace those losses. Given that the US is one of the major sources of research funding in the world, if approved, the budget will have global consequences. > >To the people within the OMB who prepared the document, these are not losses. The document makes it very clear that they view many instances of scientific thought and evidence-based policy as little more than forms of ideological indoctrination, presumably because the evidence sometimes contradicts what they'd prefer to believe.  In addition with filling their leadership positions with their critics, further cuts to the CDC, HHS, NIH, NSF, NOAA, DOE, and EPA are already a slow motion disaster for nation. Added on top of this the cuts to education, and it's clear that this is nothing less than an effort to put dogma ahead of knowledge. Likely this is heralding a new dark age for the nation where a cult of personality is put in the place of religion.",Hrmbee,2025-05-02T15:02:18,15

"And the billionaires want less educated masses, too. George Carlin called this many years ago:  >They want obedient workers. Obedient workers, people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork.

"Hey now, i know I can definitely depend on the sun to shine its deadly rays towards the earth. It's those very same rays that allow people to grow food and thrive.  Unlike organizations that incentivize one to put money into a collection plate or listen to an unhinged interpretation of religion.   Unfortunately, if the overall populace becomes less educated, it impacts the rest of society. Look at the rise of short form media like tik tok and shorts where many use to educate themselves. It oversimplies the topic, leaving no room for a nuanced discussion. Hell, it can be a curse to be educated in a society that celebrates tomfoolery magnified by social media and algorithms.",Boo_Radley80,2025-05-02T15:29:23,3
