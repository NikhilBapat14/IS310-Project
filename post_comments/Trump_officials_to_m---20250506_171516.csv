"We’re on the “Trump ‘fixes’ the problem he caused,” phase of the news cycle.",ScotTheDuck,2025-05-06T17:18:43,27
That page only states:  >This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.  I presume we are waiting on confirmation from the Chinese because Trump and his administration have repeatedly lied about alleged talks.,ResidentKelpien,2025-05-06T17:19:42,13
"Trump lying again.  China said they aren't going to the table if the tariff aren't dropped. And unlike Trump and at least on trade, China been consistent about it.",wizgset27,2025-05-06T17:19:12,6
China just [confirmed it](http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0507/c1001-40474323.html) (this is Chinese state media) so it is true this time. Both side are going to talk in Switzerland for the first time since the trade war.  Though I don’t really except any real outcome from this meeting unless for some reason unknown both side suddenly decide to drop all the tariffs.,Charming-Health-1312,2025-05-06T17:32:51,6
Right....just like how talks were apparently happening the past few weeks.,SleepyxCapybara,2025-05-06T17:19:58,4
Who are these “counterparts” that go to school in another town.,now_error_later,2025-05-06T17:20:44,3
Guess they realize they need to get the tariff situation under control fast with two nuclear powers starting to escalate their conflict massively today. Our own military is at a large disadvantage without trade,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-06T17:21:56,4
"I am at a conference and was bored and so did some browsing on Amazon this afternoon and the shit has clearly already hit the fan. On my front page there was a “we didn’t sell it this weekend” sorta sale on Starwars merchandise (I imagine I saw this because 2 weeks ago I bought several Starwars T-shirt’s). Anyway, they were all between $14-22 in April. Today they were all $30+. I’m not paying $30 for a fucking T-shirt. That’s crazy pants. Anyway his admission of no talks coupled with everything costing double by the end of May have to at least be pissing off some cultists and scaring the Nazi leadership (at least at the congressional level). So I bet these talks actually are real…",Ticksdonthavelymph,2025-05-06T17:26:48,4
"""Trump officials BEGGING Chinese counterparts to please, please, PLEASE come to the table and ""negotiate""""!",uteman1011,2025-05-06T17:31:52,3
I just want to have Xi Jinping tell us that Trump can get anything he wants...if he just bends the knee. Trump's meltdown would be epic.,bourj,2025-05-06T17:31:03,4

Didn’t he say they were meeting daily two weeks ago?      Just more lies.,hospitallers,2025-05-06T19:00:56,1
"This is useless, because no matter what the deals are, Trump would always just turn the table upside down and disregard whatever the US officials discussed. He have done that numerous time to Rubio already, and this happens more frequently with other US foreign policies. He see that as his strength, because he is ""unpredictable"". l;ol",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-06T19:31:35,1

This has been announced on by the US side. Has the Chinese side also announce the same thing?,xibeno9261,2025-05-06T18:55:09,0
"A counterpart for trump?  China has a fat, racist, piece of shit that intentionally destroys his own country too.",Richfor3,2025-05-06T18:59:03,0
Trump fixes the problem by creating another problem then lying about that problem and then claims he fixed that problem and then...and then...you know where this goes.  ,arilupe,2025-05-06T17:20:17,11
China [did confirm it](http://politics.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0507/c1001-40474323.html). It is real this time,Charming-Health-1312,2025-05-06T17:36:55,4
"Yeah their starting point was no tariffs, wonder how much they’re looking for us to lose",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-06T17:20:02,4
Stock market already jumped up. It'll fall back down after this meeting if there is even any news about it. China isn't paying extortion money to Trump so I would be surprised if anything comes of this meeting. At this point China has nothing to gain by undoing the measures they have already taken like not exporting critical materials and not allowing China post to mail to USA.,tech57,2025-05-06T18:33:24,2

"To be fair on that they it coincides with the Disney store sale for this week for May 4th.  But a lot of the stuff is ""won't be released until later this year"" So they are trying to get pre-orders in. The Disney Store just dumped a bunch of stuff from Galaxies Edge that they hadn't sold on the store before at the same prices as the park. If you wanted one, Light Sabers are 30% off (but you can get a much better non-Disney light saber elsewhere.)",ianrl337,2025-05-06T18:12:56,2

CNBC is a leftist rag masquerading as a news source.,Ciroc_Croc,2025-05-07T01:12:18,1
Trump needlessly causes a disaster.  Trump places a band-aid on the disaster.  Trump declares himself a hero for saving the universe.  MAGA dummies soil themselves with excitement.  This is all a repeat from his first term.,HumanRuse,2025-05-06T17:29:52,6
