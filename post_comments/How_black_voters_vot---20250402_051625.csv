African Americans voting for the Democratic Party until 1960 is crazy,[deleted],2025-04-02T08:38:32,3
"So if I rage (cause I'm black will this mess be taken down!) Someone put up some divisive sh!t and as per usual people chime in about ""BLACK PEOPLE"". Everyone non-Black always wants to speak for us and about us. You have a racist psychopath sitting at 1600 Penn ave and someone thought it was a good ideal to put this up. You wonder why 92/80 is trending, you wonder why a large portion of Black people ain't gettin involved in your protests. So either a troll/infiltrator put this up or someone who thought Cory Booker breaking the filibuster record was insignificant or Jackie Robinson is insignificant or Rosa Parks is insignificant, or MLK/MalcolmX/MedgarEvers/MayaAngelo/AngelaDavis and on and on are insignificant but whoever did this did it for shock value - full stop.  SO WHAT BLACK PEOPLE VOTED DEM PRE-1960 AND AFTER THAT, BLACK PEOPLE'S DESCENDENTS WERE BROUGHT OVER HERE AS SLAVES AND HELD FOR 24 GENERATIONS IN FORCED SERVITUDE  - FOR THE UNINTELLIGENT THAT 244 YEARS  They further have been subjected to every humiliation after a civil war that WHITE PEOPLE TO THIS DAY DENY WAS ABOUT FREEING SAID SLAVES. Black people for the past 160 years or 16 generations after their ancestors were conditionally set free have been beaten, discriminated against, RAPED, denied housing, quality healthcare, education, financial opportunities, faced unjust persecution and a revolving door carceral system. They have had their neighborhood saturated with controlled substances and alcohol, poor food and neglected neighborhoods. Our language, hair and mannerisms are appropriated for white consumption - but hey lets put up a voting graph of how African American's have historically voted because they are the ones who got America in this mess in the first place. WHITE AMERICAN'S also voted for Trump but I don't see a graph of or historical perspective of how White American's have voted for the past 400 years!  You think you're divided, well guess what you are!",fringegurl,2025-04-02T10:57:47,2

"Especially considering the title uses ""since 1932"" rather than ""1936 through 2004.""   It's so dumb.  I found the[ factcheck ](https://www.factcheck.org/2008/04/blacks-and-the-democratic-party/)article that the chart is from and it was a 2008 article.  Dumber yet.",VanDenBroeck,2025-04-02T10:50:29,5
