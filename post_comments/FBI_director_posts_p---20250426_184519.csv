"I’ll give you a hint: he doesn’t care about breaking policy, he doesn’t care about breaking the law. He wants to do whatever he wants to, and is supported by a President hellbent on vengeance and a Congress that is too chicken (or alternatively they secretly like it as long as they are the ones in power).

"The aim here is to remove judges from their positions, and intimidate a bunch of judges into resigning from their positions in protest.    If you can arrest, jail and prosecute a judge, and use your authoritarian powers to ensure they cannot legally prevail, you place everyone else into this choice: Accept and play along, or leave the field - in handcuffs, or in resignation.    I think the end goal is to clear these positions for loyalists, ensuring right wing control of the justice system for the foreseeable future. ",No_Rope_3943,2025-04-26T19:40:35,101

"Stop assuming these people care about the rules or playing by them.  They don't and aren't. Meanwhile, the left keeps thinking they can ""rule"" them into a corner, but all they have accomplished is showing them that if enough of them just say ""fuck your rules"" and do what they want nobody is going to stop them.  So many of us assume our family, neighbors, coworkers, parents and closest friends would act the way we believe we would, were we to stumble across a stranger in need.   But the truth is, a not insignificant percent would see that stranger and try to take advantage of them. Maybe even Hurt them or kill them for their own selfish reasons.  This is why you hear ""The pain is the point"", because to some of them it is. Sure, others are true believers who see the pain as an unfortunate side effect of policy, like a war has casualties, but some don't care about the policy at all, it's just the means of getting to the pain part.  People are selfish. People don't make sense. People with the ""strongest"" moral foundations will take a sledgehammer to them on a dime when they stand to benefit more by ignoring their own personal precedent.   It's who we are as a species. Always has been, always will be. We have spent only the last 100 years or so with the thought that we were more civilized now than we were 1000, 2000, or 10000 years ago.   The truth? We are all just monkeys in a never ending civil war against each other for any number of reasons fighting over imaginary lines in the dirt. We all want to see those outside our group submit to our will, and when they do, someone will want us to submit to theirs.  We covet, we hoard. We destroy because it entertains us.  None of its new. The Bible describes it, the Quran as well. Every religious text is rife with death and destruction inflicted upon our brother or sister human suffering for the sake of destroying imaginary enemies.  Cavemen drew it on cave walls. In the future 1000 years, they will do the same, if we make it that long as a species.  And the winner gets to write the history.
