"Waste of time.  Biden will say he authorized all of it.  He won't throw any loyalists under the bus.  Unless they have video evidence to the contrary, that'll be impossible to beat in court.",cathbadh,2025-04-29T10:08:17,335

"I don't think there's any chance of winning anything in legal sense of undoing what was done, but every time he says things like this democrats have no choice except to go ""nuh uh he was sharp as a tack"".  Which is hilarious to watch. I think he should keep doing this. It's their fault they propped up a senile old man and pretended he was running the show. Keep reminding everyone they did it.",_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-04-29T09:42:32,6

"""...report recommended that no criminal charges be brought forward against President Biden.  This was in part because the special counsel determined that President Biden's memory had such ""significant limitations"" that it would not be possible to convince a jury that President Biden held a ""mental state of willfulness"" that a serious felony requires.

">Hur’s report included several shocking lines about Biden’s memory, which the report said “was significantly limited” during his 2023 interviews with the special counsel.  TIL direct interviews are speculation.",Wesdawg1241,2025-04-29T11:06:15,-9
"You're trolling, right? It's in the fucking headline. Quote from the article:  >Hur’s report included several shocking lines about Biden’s memory, which the report said “was significantly limited” during his 2023 interviews with the special counsel. “We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” it said. “Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt. It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him — by then a former president well into his eighties — of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.”  If you want to play semantics and say, ""Well, ackshually they didn't *declare* that he was mentally incompetent to stand trial"" then sure, go for it. That doesn't change how damning the report is.  It's called *implication*. Let me help you out. Read paragraphs 2 and 1 of the article, in that order.  Paragraph 2 says:  >“Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden **willfully** retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen.”  Paragraph 1 says:  >[Robert Hur](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/robert-hur-special-counsel-biden-classified-documents-rcna65561) has declined to prosecute President Joe Biden for his handling of classified documents but said in a report released Thursday that... part of the reason he wouldn't charge Biden was that **the president could portray himself as an ""elderly man with a poor memory"" who would be sympathetic to a jury.**  If Robert Hurr concluded that Biden **willfully** retained classified documents and then went on to say that he won't prosecute him (again, even though Biden **willfully** retained them) because Biden could portray himself as an elderly man with a poor memory -- and not only that, he said outright that Biden's memory was **significantly limited** \-- what does that say about Hurr's conclusion of Biden's mental capacity? Biden is either accountable for his actions or he's not. Hurr is very obviously stating that Biden didn't have the mental capacity to be held accountable for his actions. It's really not that difficult. I don't know why you're being so obtuse.     Oh boy, here Reddit goes brigading again",Wesdawg1241,2025-04-29T11:02:35,13
"Read the fucking article or go back to school to improve your comprehension, you dolt. It's spelled out for you.  >“Our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials after his vice presidency when he was a private citizen,”  And why does Hurr say the evidence doesn't establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?  >Hur’s report included several shocking lines about Biden’s memory, which the report said “was significantly limited” during his 2023 interviews with the special counsel. Biden’s age and presentation would make it more difficult to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the now-81-year-old was guilty of willfully committing a crime.
