"> To date, the government has produced no evidence supporting its accusations against Öztürk other than a 2024 op-ed she co-wrote for the Tufts campus newspaper. In it, she criticized school administrators for not doing more to condemn Israel's war in Gaza, which she called a ""plausible genocide.""  So zero evidence of any wrongdoing at all, but spent a month and a half in jail?",Qubeye,2025-05-09T15:03:11,2

"She was abducted in Somerville Massachusetts.  She was moved quickly to New Hampshire and also Vermont, I forget in which order.  But as she knew she was at risk of being arrested (for a fucking op-ed in a school newspaper nobody reads), her lawyer filed a writ of habeas corpus within hours. At the time of filing, she was in Vermont which is why this was heard there.  Shortly thereafter, she was flown to Lousiana. The administration was hoping to have the case heard there, as the judges are not nearly as immigration friendly.",Apprentice57,2025-05-09T18:29:09,2
