Make no mistake, undermining Denmark‚Äôs sovereign territory is going to ruin our alliance with Denmark beyond repair. Our other allies will realize that we cannot be trusted and relied upon.

"We already know this. Unlike MAGAworms, Europeans are able to make distinctions.  Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way‚Äîbut many Europeans pursue higher education (because it's free) and understand that even Americans are held captive by this regime. As far as I know from media reports, there are no significant negative experiences or sentiments against American citizens. However, anti-American products do exist‚Äîmost of them are linked to Republican sponsors, a.k.a. enablers.  You can check some of the European subreddits where Americans seek advice on relocating or finding refuge from this chaotic world. Most, if not all, are welcomed with grace and offered help.  We can only do so much from our side of the world.  As I mentioned here before‚Äîhelp us help you. If people choose not to vote or remain silent, we cannot change anything. If people won‚Äôt exercise their rights to resist the regime, we cannot do it for them.  One of the reasons why the EU is so reluctant to impose tariffs in the USA is not fear ( let's be honest - we kind of are ...rich ) , it's actually American citizens. A lot of them are descendants from Europe. It's like bullying your family members.",pianoavengers,2025-04-01T01:53:25,1

"I think a solid 30-35% are diehard MAGAts who know and don't care, but I personally know a lot of people who either believe his BS, or who don't pay enough attention to the news to know wtf is even going on--and so if his policies don't affect them personally, they're clueless as to those policies' existence.   It's maddening.

"Too true!  People who look back on the 1950s in America with fondness weren't actually there to live through it.  They have no concept of how bad it was.   It's true that people were paid enough that the wife could stay home much of the time, but there was still much more wrong than most people seem to understand.  Back then people didn't talk about a lot of horrific shit, like all the sexual assault and domestic violence, how women were treated like children, and how so much crap was hidden by the Good Ol' Boys Club as they protected each other from the consequences of their illegal crap.
