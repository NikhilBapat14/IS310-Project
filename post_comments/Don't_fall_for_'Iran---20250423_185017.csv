"President Trump’s attitude towards Iran is causing many to scratch their heads.  He has threatened the Iranian regime that unless it verifiably dismantles its nuclear program, America and Israel will destroy it.  He has backed this up by moving more US warships to the region and deploying around one third of America’s B-2 stealth bombers to Diego Garcia.  I, for one, am not scratching my head, proceed Mr. President!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T08:36:31,3
It’s really going to be up to Trump and if he’s willing to stand up to Israel and tell them Iran isn’t our problem.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-23T21:13:54,-3
"Iran hasn't started a war in 300+ years.   The lying media wants us to fight someone else's war.  I used to think Iran was all sand and huts.   Rick Steves had a nice documentary that made me rethink how Iran is.   Yeah maybe their government sucks, but so did ours for the last four years.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYoa9hI3CXg",Ironman650,2025-04-23T20:11:27,-14
"Wut...?    Iran is responsible for countless American deaths over the years. Iran is 100% our problem, ESPECIALLY if they acquire a nuclear bomb.",culman13,2025-04-24T00:02:03,24
I guess you conveniently forgot the ballistic and cruise missiles attacks on Israel last year.,Ask4MD,2025-04-23T21:08:26,16
