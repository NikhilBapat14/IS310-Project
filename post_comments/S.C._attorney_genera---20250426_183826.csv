">[South Carolina](https://www.advocate.com/voices/nancy-mace-south-carolina-transgender)’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, sent a letter to the city of Columbia requesting that it overturn its municipal ban on conversion therapy. Wilson said the ban violates a state religious freedom law and is unconstitutional because it violates the religious rights of faith-based counselors.  So, Christian nationalists are admitting that banning torture violates their religious beliefs.     Christian nationalists are advocating for torturing LGBTQIA+, because their version of exegesis says that queer people are ""unholy"" in their eyes.     How is this in any way ""loving thy neighbor""?     Apparently, ""loving thy neighbor"" means torturing them until they kill themselves.",southpawFA,2025-04-26T18:43:14,31

"Research on the issue of family acceptance of LGBTQ youth conducted at San Francisco State University found that ""compared with LGBTQ young people who were not rejected or were only a little rejected by their parents and caregivers because of their LGBTQ+ identity, highly rejected LGBTQ young people were:  * *8 times more likely to commit suicide* * *Nearly 6 times more likely to experience depression* * *More than 3 times more likely to use illegal drugs* * *More than 3 times as likely to be high risk for HIV or AIDS.*  All major medical associations, from the AMA, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Psychological Association stand against conversion therapy.    ***According to The Trevor Project’s 2020 National Survey on LGBTQ Youth Mental Health, 10% of LGBTQ youth reported undergoing conversion therapy, with 78% reporting it occurred when they were under age 18.***    Youth who reported undergoing conversion therapy reported more than twice the rate of attempting suicide in the past year compared to those who did not.    ***Furthermore, a peer-reviewed study published by The Trevor Project in the American Journal of Public Health found that LGBTQ youth who underwent conversion therapy were more than twice as likely to report having attempted suicide and more than 2.5 times as likely to report multiple suicide attempts in the past year.***    * *Rates of attempted suicide by LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation were more than double (48%) the rate of LGBT young adults who reported no conversion experiences (22%).* * *Suicide attempts nearly tripled for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation (63%).* * *High levels of depression more than doubled (33%) for LGBT young people whose parents tried to change their sexual orientation compared with those who reported no conversion experiences (16%) and more than tripled (52%) for LGBT young people who reported both home-based and out-of-home efforts to change their sexual orientation.* * *Sexual orientation change experiences during adolescence by both parents/caregivers and externally by therapists and religious leaders were associated with lower young adult socioeconomic status, less educational attainment, and lower weekly income.*    Conversion therapy must be abolished!    We must build a society where every sexual orientation & gender identity is fully accepted, loved, and valued with the greatest esteem!",southpawFA,2025-04-26T18:46:34,13

"the SC doesn’t work that way now, they’ll rule (if this reaches them) that the constitution doesn’t mention conversion therapy therefore it’s not constitutional to ban it. They’ll use the opposite logic as well if it suits them though.",BestieJules,2025-04-26T19:14:00,5
A ban on torture is unconstitutional? Or is conversion therapy not torture? Let’s walk it out,f1del1us,2025-04-27T13:30:17,1
