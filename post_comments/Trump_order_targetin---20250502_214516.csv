"**Summary**:   A federal judge has permanently blocked Trump‚Äôs executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie, calling it unconstitutional and retaliatory. The order, citing national security over the firm‚Äôs ties to Clinton‚Äôs 2016 campaign, barred federal employees from working with its attorneys. Judge Howell ruled it violated free speech and due process. The Trump administration will likely appeal. Perkins Coie, represented by Williams & Connolly, won a major legal victory.",pharrt,2025-05-02T21:48:20,114

"This ruling is a banger. Instant classic, hall of fame.  Where's the MAGA ""muh constitution"" supporters?  > No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‚ÄúThe first thing we do, let‚Äôs kill all the lawyers.‚Äù When Shakespeare‚Äôs character, a rebel leader intent on becoming king hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of his plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding ‚Äú[a]way with him,‚Äù referring to an educated clerk, who ‚Äúcan make obligations and write court hand"" Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the  path to more power. See Walters v. Nat‚Äôl Ass‚Äôn of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24  (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be ‚Äúthat disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government‚Äù).  > In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs kill all the lawyers,‚Äù EO 14230 takes the approach of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs kill the lawyers I don‚Äôt like,‚Äù sending the clear message: lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.  > Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish  certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution  > Executive Order 14230 is unconstitutional",Out_of_the_Bloo,2025-05-03T02:56:24,80

If that's what you took away from this thread then it's no surprise you got tricked into voting for a fraud and a con man.  If you re-read the decision and give it some genuine thought you might come to see that your characterization of this as 'a right to access US intelligence product' is a red herring.  Whoever is telling you that's what this is really about is lying to you.  Are you smarter than the people tricking you with their lies?  Doesn't look it to me based on your comment here.
