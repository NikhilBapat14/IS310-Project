"And just think, in 2024 America's economy was the envy of the world, America was the economy that had bounced back the best from Covid!  And in just 90 days, destroyed and shot in the foot for no reason!",kia75,2025-04-25T10:00:41,26
"> As a businessman, Trump was notorious for operating in bad faith. He has been accused of deceiving customers, employees, investors, and creditors. Before he pivoted to politics, his bank of choice was one known for its relationship with Russian oligarchs and alleged money launderers. He repeatedly drove his properties into bankruptcy, leaving creditors, investors, and employees to bear the costs of his failure. >  > As a politician, Trump vowed to “make America great again” with the same predatory methods he used in business. He does not appear to believe in mutually beneficial transactions. The only way he feels confident that he prevailed is if the other party suffers. His plan for enriching America was predicated on dominating and wronging others. Plans like that seldom work even at the start, and never work for long. >  > Good faith is the beginning of success for nations as well as individuals. Trump’s bad faith and poor choices once ruined only those who made the voluntary personal or corporate decision to do business with him. But no one can choose to sit out Trump’s trade war. The casualties are already accumulating.",tech57,2025-04-25T10:19:14,19

"“No American business—no business that serves the American market—will commit to any capital expenditure under these conditions.”   I’ve been beating this drum for some time now. Navarro will be Trumps downfall if he continues to take advice from him and his Treasury Sec is merely a sock puppet designed to put a happy face on Trumps 50 year old bachelors economic degree brain farts.  At the moment we’re in the calm before the storm, the buzz on Bloomberg is a steady stream of ""wtf?"" from analysts on how to manage egregious uncertainty. Currently the market is too high on hopium that Trump will listen to reason but there are enough initial signs of supply chains breaking which means a future markets crash.",jpmondx,2025-04-25T11:44:54,10

"Literally anyone who has purchased real estate in New York knows exactly the type of scumbag that Trump is.  New Yorkers don't really drive cars and living space is at a premium, so ""real estate crook"" is our version of ""used car salesman."" And it doesn't get worse than Queens.  There is a reason he is so unpopular in his hometown.",gradientz,2025-04-25T12:32:01,11

I work in supplying the food industry with equipment and refrigeration. We have been sitting on the same proposals and quotes since the summer because no one knew if the economy would keep going in the current direction with the looming 2024 election. Then Trump won and the waiting continued. Now some of my customers are forced to move ahead under far worse pricing while others are switching to survival mode,Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-27T13:53:31,2
