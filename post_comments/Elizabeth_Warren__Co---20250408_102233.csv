Absolutely!  It would take 4 GOP senators and 5 GOP reps to end an American economic catastrophe.   Here's a list of House districts Republicans won by 9% or less in 2024. The special elections in FL-01 and FL-06 last week saw a drop in GOP support by over 9% since November.   https://preview.redd.it/r953kswxvmte1.jpeg?width=276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3a700c129fb19ecb9e6c44a9544819afce85adf  \^\^\^ [*source*](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-house.html)  People in those 21 districts have disproportionate power to rein in Trump by putting pressure on their reps.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-08T11:03:57,19

I have been calling and emailing our senators and representative about tariffs for last 2 weeks. This last week I started calling and emailing every day.,Silent_Section_6409,2025-04-08T11:12:22,16

We need to engage different communities with custom messaging. Many are eagerly awaiting the Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo has had to alter pre-order plans due to the tariffs and it's likely the price will increase.   There's an opportunity to turn gamers against Trump here.,SirCatsworthTheThird,2025-04-08T12:13:47,15
"ICYMI, Trump's formula for calculating tariffs on foreign nations was NOT based on their tariffs towards the US, but on a calculation of how to balance the trade deficit with the foreign country.   It is beyond asinine to expect less populous and less prosperous countries to import the same value of goods that we import from them. We look like fools to the rest of world for having leadership that doesn't have a clue about how international trade and tariffs actually work. Sad!",Nerd-19958,2025-04-08T17:34:22,14

Hello!! Somebody came to work today!   I’ve constantly heard the GOP saying that democrats need to get off of their lazy butts— the level of projection and lack of self-awareness is unreal. It’s getting personal to everybody finally now that their 401k’s are getting wiped out.,mlineras,2025-04-08T10:55:08,8

"Yeah the majority of Republicans are rich, the other are misguided boot lickers hoping for the best outcome and a small majority are white supremacist, fascist wannabes. Don't count on them to come to the rescue. It's already too late anyway what's done is done. He needs to be removed from office immediately!    If all of his actions since January don't constitute unfit for duty as Commander in Chief, then I don't know what does. He's not playing with a full deck obviously andthere are emergency powers that Congress has which could pull him from office, but by the time they agree to  anything his term will already be up and more damage will be done.   And you can forget uprising, the people as a whole are too afraid of retribution or prosecution. We all better just get used to it! There's probably no hope and things are only going to get worse and worse. I myself am just hoping to get to a nice Nordic country.",[deleted],2025-04-08T15:33:09,6
It's more than one man.  It's the GOP and right wing SCOTUS judges that enable him.       It's the rich fucks who fund him.      It's the religious leaders that support him.      It's the media who whitewash him.     It's the jackasses who voted for him.,frisbeethecat,2025-04-09T06:51:02,6
"No, the message needs to be Republicans will not stand up to Trump but the Democrats will. Remove the agency of the Republican representatives and give it back to the people via electing Democrats.

"I say no way. I don't want the democrats to come save the day again. This happens time and time again. Republicans mess shit up and the democrats have to clean up a mess only to be blamed for said mess. Republicans are like toddlers reaching for the stove...... It's time we finally let them touch it. Let them burn for a bit, let it go until Trumps name is said as a joke by the very people that voted for him. Let the republican party dissolve and take a seat at the kids table for awhile. We can rebuild better without them.",Spazic77,2025-04-09T03:36:46,8

"Democracy is one of the better forms of government, its just that this current admin was basically given the go ahead to rip all the Democracy put and replace it with autocracy (a government ruled by one person ah la king or dictator.)  The problem is that this current democracy doesn't properly reflect the representations of all its citizens, which leads to imbalance (example; governments which were 100% male rarely took into account the needs of women, 50% of society.)
