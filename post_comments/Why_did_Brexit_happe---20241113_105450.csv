"Well, the current similar example is the 2024 US election. Trump just yelled about tarrif being great and will help the country with no substantial reasoning or facts. And his voters believed him.  And guess what, after the election, google search for ""what is tariff"" and ""how tariffs work"" skyrocketed.  So long story short, voters are stupid AF",FlashPt128,2024-11-13T17:02:07,10

There was a [significant disinformation campaign](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781119743347.ch6) supported by a particular segment of the British press and online spheres.,nosecohn,2024-11-13T12:30:59,15
"TL;DR: Many voters did not fully grasp what Brexit would mean in practice. Many Leave voters were surprised that Vote Leave actually won. In the end Brexit turned out to include many trade-offs that had not been put on the foreground, which made the process way more difficult and lengthier than expected by ordinary voters.  The outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum was close: 51.9% voted Leave and 48.1% voted Remain ([BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/eu_referendum/results)). The most important concerns for Leave voters were sovereignty and immigration, whereas the most important concern for Remain voters was the economy ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/other-publication/peoples-stated-reasons-for-voting-leave-or-remain/)).   Leave voters felt that too many laws were made in Brussels by the (unelected bureaucrats of the) EU, with not enough say over these laws by the UK. These concerns were strongly pushed by the British tabloid press ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/06/21/482952581/bendy-bananas-and-barmaid-bosoms-the-u-k-s-crazy-anti-eu-food-myths)), but saying that an unpopular policy was demanded by Brussels/the EU was often a convenient way for British ministers to avoid having to take responsibility for agreeing to these policies in the first place or even adding extra rules on top (a practice known as gold-plating). The Vote Leave campaign aptly summed up the desire for more sovereignty with the slogan 'Take Back Control'. They also pointed towards the high contribution of the UK to the EU budget and suggested that these funds could be better spent at home, for example on the National Health Service. They put this on a red bus and drove it all around the country ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-42698981)).   In 2004 ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe became new members of the EU. That meant that their citizens got the right to work in other EU Member States, including the UK. As a result, a large number of these citizens moved to the UK for work. This fueled the idea in the UK that there were just too many East Europeans in the country  and that this led to wage suppression and by voting for Brexit these immigrants would leave again. In addition, in 2015 there was a large uncontrolled influx of people from the Middle East and Africa into the EU. Many Brits were concerned with possibly large numbers of asylum seekers arriving in Britain, which was also fueled by the British tabloid press ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/tabloid-tales-how-the-tabloid-press-shaped-the-brexit-vote/)). A related concern was that Turkey was a candidate country for membership of the EU and this might in the future also lead to a large number of Turkish migrants moving to the UK.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-11-13T17:52:05,7

"Similar to the US right now. People were feeling economic pain and the media blamed immigrants. A huge amount of money was spent converting people to Leave, often with illegal money and ads using disinformation.

"While the Brexit referendum was legally speaking only consultative, it was inconceivable not to take this outcome seriously. Prime Minister Cameron had campaigned for Remain and this defeat caused him to resign. Which meant that this public desire for Brexit had to be fulfilled, but it was unclear how to do so in practice. The Brexit could be hard, meaning a severance of all special legal obligations between the UK and the EU after termination of British membership of the EU, or soft, where there would be some sort of continued special legal cooperation, for example by staying in the Single Market and have a limited free movement of people. But while Remain was ruled out by the referendum, none of the Brexit versions got majority support in the Parliament. Prime Minister May had started the process of withdrawing from the EU in 2017, which allowed for a two year negotiating phase between the UK and the EU, but by 2019 she couldn't convince a majority of the Parliament to vote for her version of Brexit ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-46885828)). So she resigned as well.  So was Brexit ever going to happen? It turned out that it was difficult for an EU Member State to just   leave the European Union. However, one of the main leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, Boris Johnson, became the new Prime Minister and won a general election on the promise of delivering a hard Brexit with the slogan to 'Get Brexit done'. One problem of a hard Brexit was that there would need to be border controls between the UK and the EU. But in Northern Ireland the UK had a long and very difficult to secure border with the Republic of Ireland, which remained an EU Member State. Reinstatement of border controls might also bring back the cycle of violence of the Troubles and would go against the Good Friday Agreement that was meant to prevent further violence there. In the end, Johnson decided that it was more important to have the UK formally exit the EU, so border checks would be introduced within the UK, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Northern Ireland would have to follow certain EU rules, without being able to influence these ([BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-62071102)).  Ultimately, the UK did finally terminate membership of the EU in 2020. People cared because for a long time it seemed politically impossible to implement Brexit and also accept the trade-offs that came with it. Additionally, voluntarily leaving the largest trading bloc next door would also mean much less economic growth for the EU and especially the UK ([Centre for European Reform](https://www.cer.eu/research/cost-of-brexit); [UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/levelling-up-by-levelling-down-the-economic-and-political-costs-of-brexit/)). One group of right-wing Brexiteers claimed that leaving the EU would enable the UK to get better trade deals with the EU and other countries that would specifically benefit the UK. They also dreamt of a Singapore-on-Thames, where the UK would drastically deregulate and massively lower domestic taxation ([UK in a Changing Europe](https://ukandeu.ac.uk/singapore-on-thames-is-dead-long-live-singapore-on-thames/)). Left-wing Brexiteers instead emphasised that the UK would no longer be beholden to the neoliberal policies of the EU and thus could start building a more socialist utopia in the UK with higher taxation and higher public spending ([Briefings for Britain](https://www.briefingsforbritain.co.uk/a-lexiteer-manifesto-building-a-british-social-model/)). In the end though, Brexit did get done, but nobody wants to hear about it anymore due to Brexit fatigue ([The Loop](https://theloop.ecpr.eu/the-non-issue-of-brexit-in-the-2024-uk-election-campaign/)).",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-11-13T17:54:32,7

"Russia still has a slightly stronger military than China though, at least according to the UN it does, not that it matters since they are allies, i tend to look at the relationships between countries in terms of military power since at the end of the day that's what's most   important, but when measuring a countries military strength you have to look at everything, because everything matters when it comes to military strength, you have to look at manpower including total population, available manpower, fit-for-service, reaching military age   annually, active service, active reserves, paramilitary and capital cities, you have to look at equipment like aircraft fleet strength including fighters/interceptors, attack/strike, transports (fixed wing), trainer fleets, special mission, tanker fleets, helicopter fleets and attack   helicopters, tank strength including  armored fighting vehicles, self-propelled artillery, towed artillery and rocket projectors, naval fleet strength including fleet strength by tonnage, aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, submarines, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, coastal patrol crafts and   Mine warfare crafts, you have to look at finances including defense budgets, external debt, purchasing power parity (PPP) and reserves of foreign exchange and gold, you have to look at logistics including airports, labor force strength, major ports and terminals, merchant   marine strength, railway coverage and roadway coverage, you have to look at natural resources including oil production, oil consumption, proven oil reserves, natural gas production, proven natural gas reserves, coal production, coal consumption and proven coal reserves   and you have to look at geography including square land area, coastline coverage, border coverage and waterway coverage, i know that's a lot but I've done my research and I know how to measure the military strength of a country, ive got it down to a science, there are a total of   195 countries including 193 recognized nations and two unrecognized being the Vatican City and Palestine, i say unrecognized because at the very least to be considered a country you need a representative at the UN, and neither the Vatican nor Palestine does, according to my   most recent measurements about 2 months ago we have 1 United States, 2 Russia, 3 China, 4 India, 5 South Korea, 6 United Kingdom, 7 France, 8 Japan, 9 Turkiye, 10 Italy, 11 Brazil, 12 Pakistan, 13 Indonesia, 14 Germany, 15 Israel, 16 Iran, 17 Spain, 18 Australia, 19 Egypt, 20 Ukraine",JrpgTitan100684,2025-03-31T09:06:39,1
