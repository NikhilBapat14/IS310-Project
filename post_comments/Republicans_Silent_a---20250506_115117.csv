"From the very top of the article;  >Rolling Stone¬†reached out to all 53 GOP senators after the president said he didn't know whether he needs to honor the nation's founding document. None replied  We've been doing this dance for 9 years now. My problem has NEVER been with Donald Trump. My problem has always been with his enablers and co conspirators. Bad people can appear in every facet of our lives but only a truly evil society would ever elevate such a sociopath to any position of power, let alone as THE defining element of an entire society.  It took 70 million people to watch everything that was said and done by this psychopath and still make an overt effort to pull the lever.  And it took 100 percent of the republican party to sell their country out to their own personal ambition. The last straw for me was looking the other way on the vote to not convict on the second impeachment but they just keep  racking up stars in my book with every action ever since.  They are all well beyond redemption. But so are people like Schumer who keeps lying to us that there's some kind of hope that there's a future to work with these dishonorable people.   What's a bridge too far Chuck? They already have concentration camps and pay to play scams. They overtly killed Americans by confirming an anti vaxxer to HHS. They dismantled the ENTIRE government already. They are withholding funds from blue states and arresting judges. Shutting down information streams by force and threatening law firms. They fired the generals Chuck  At what point will it be clear enough for you? Republicans are evil. They are dishonorable and depraved. And so is any ""American"" who still supports this  And 100 percent of the republican Senators just told us that they don't give a single FUCK about the constitution",PayTheTeller,2025-05-06T12:23:25,1098

As a fellow North Carolinian your response is annoying and quite frankly explains the exact position our state is currently in.   You literally witnessed republicans strip the powers of the Governor position because they lost the fucking election. You also just witnessed them try to throw out thousands of votes and sue the state to prevent election results from being certified to keep a democrat out of the NC Supreme Court. Luckily a federal judge just ordered them to certify it but we will see if it actually happens.  Their defeatism is valid as fuck. Minimizing the current state of federal and state politics is exactly how we‚Äôve gotten to this point to begin with.,[deleted],2025-05-06T14:22:06,6

"I am pretty sure a battalion of fantastic Democratic politicians are going to sweep through the nation, securing voting sites and forcing Congress to recognize and uphold their true and open election, even as the doors are kicked in by another Jan 6 mob. Each state, in charge of their own elections, will be swept up in a wave of critical thought and democratic fervor as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana all vow to elect Democrats to represent their newfound progressive ideals. They won't let felons on the ballot, so Donald Trump won't even be an option.   Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi will be on the front lines facing off against soldiers in riot gear, fighting through the tear gas to make sure the votes are counted, sacrificing their own safety to rally the surging Democrat supporters that will take on the US military in the streets of DC. JD Vance in his role as VP will proudly certify the election, defiant and triumphant.   It will be a glorious day on Capitol Hill. I feel really, really good about where this is headed, and I think the reddest states are going to really be pulling for the good guys this time around. The next Democratic president will have the full support of the Republicans as they seek to undo Trump's damage, and they'll prosecute all of the bad actors, from the President through his entire Cabinet and the Congresspeople that broke the law, too. But only after the SCOTUS reverses their decision about presidential immunity and after they remove the power of the pardon from the office before the end of his term.",starliteburnsbrite,2025-05-06T15:54:31,1

"And when the Bolsheviks took power in Russia there was. When Assad crushed dissent in Syria there was.   The German public in the 1930s had been crushed by the Weimar republic days. Impoverished and tired, they looked to Hitler to fix the economy. Hitler delivered on his promise. Their society wasn't nearly as polarized as we are. Germany is a small country and had a relatively homogenous culture. The difference between US liberals and conservatives is night and day. Nor did a large swath of their population believe freedom is something you occasionally had to die for.   Even with all the chaos of today's politics, the lives of most Americans have been barely affected. Shortages and economic woes are coming, but its the tip of the iceberg of what a transition to authoritarianism means. Most people in America still have \*some\* faith in the government, even if its just their local and state government, and while there is doubt in institutions, most people still believe in them.   But as we know, Trump has surrounded himself with yes men and doesn't make good decisions. Perhaps one of the worst decisions he could make, and probably will make, is to use lethal force on a protest. If you look back at history - a lot civil wars begin this way. Because, when the government starts using extrajudicial lethal force on its citizens, faith in the government evaporates overnight. Or maybe its not lethal force at a protest, but its a serious escalation of the black bag kidnappings (talking about tens or hundreds of thousands instead of hundreds). Eventually, unless the government actually renders positive services and protection for its citizens, a society reaches that tipping point where the vast majority of people do not trust the government.   Extrajudicial justice (killing and kidnappings) is a bat signal to the worst members of a society that \*there is no law.\* These are people who would love to rule by force, and think anything is theirs if they take it that way. Its especially bad when a lot of these people are also members of the military or law enforcement - which are the people who should be responsible for enforcing the law and stopping the aforementioned.  So how does a civil war begin? Armed gangs of these people start looting and killing people. Normally, you'd call the national guard or military in to restore order, but in this case you've already called them and the people don't trust them. In most cases, the military has already turned on itself because some people will follow orders to kill civilians and others will not. In the case of America the military will almost certainly largely divide along racial lines because Trump is a pro-white nationalist. It's a 60/40 split.   There's a lot more, but this is the basis of how it starts.",armageddon_20xx,2025-05-06T18:56:48,5
"It's not defeatism to believe that they will go all in on anti-democratic means to maintain power.

"An EO doesn't give him the authority to do that, the only thing EOs do is direct executive branch authorities on what to do.  EOs are not laws.  The move towards fascism is worrying but there are positive developments. Trump is stumbling on overruling state authority.  Wisconsin drew a line in the sand with the memo demanding that state authorities force federal authorities to follow the law. Many states are passing new laws to protect state constituents from federal authorities.  Trump made an all out attack on judiciary and lawyers but has failed to do so, instead they made a bogus arrest hoping to intimidate judges. It might not seem like a big deal because ""trump can just ignore court rulings"" but without any legal backing he's going to continue to face resistance from state authorities. If Trump steps too far out of line then states may consider this an act of aggression against the states. The states, that no doubt have formed a private coalition by this point, may act in unison to resist federal authority. This would sink the US's foreign ambitions and leave it extremely vulnerable to all manner of attacks from China.  Addendum: Just to be clear I'm NOT saying we're out of the woods. We're FAR from that. I am just saying it's not hopeless yet. Most of the most grim predictions were out of fear that the conservative SCOTUS would go full MAGA on every single issue and they aren't. This was a reasonable prediction because of that baffling ruling that made the President immune to the law.",Odd_Jelly_1390,2025-05-06T13:32:43,8
"That's kind of the thing about hope. It can exist even when there is no logic for it. That's what the greatest speeches, the poems, the movies, the novels have been talking about since man first scribbled on a cave.   But we don't even need to manifest it here out of nothing. There are a TON of reasons to be hopeful about how this all ends.  You talk about having your eyes open, but *you* have your eyes too wide to see the details. Your fears, Trump's promises, and sensationalist headlines have you accepting Trump's agenda as inevitable, just like he intends. The result is you believing and quoting things that aren't actually happening. Getting beyond that and into the details of this administration reveals a picture no where near as scary as Trump would have us believe.  > He signed an EO to give him the power to use the military for domestic law enforcement.   First, an EO doesn't give him power to do anything. An EO is an interagency memo, that's it. He issues a memo to the DOJ to look into how the military can *help* local police forces. The result of the EO will be the states counties and cities saying, ""no thanks we're good"" and the military saying their own policies forbid them to act as law enforcement. Sure he'd LOVE to have DOJ wedge the military into Main Street America to fulfill his dictator fantasy. But he has not made that legal. Like most things, he COULD cross over that line down the road but that's not what's happening right now.   > He is depoting US citizens to foreign jails without due process.   That has not happened. No US citizens has been sent to a foreign prison. People have been sent who shouldnt have, and it's awful, but it has not crossed that constitutional line.   **Reasons to be hopeful** - The administration has lost most of the court cases brought against them - Public polls are bottoming out and that's *before* most people have felt the pain of tarriffs - Polls show that despite his constant attempts to blame Biden for the economy, the people aren't buying it - We're about to see empty shelves in stores, which will effect everyone regardless of whether they watch Fox or PBS or no news at all; Opinions will turn FAST when that happens - GOP Congress people have been piping up with small criticisms much more than they were, showing the iron grip might be loosening - The US state structure is unique; it would be much harder to become a dictator here.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-06T19:00:18,3
