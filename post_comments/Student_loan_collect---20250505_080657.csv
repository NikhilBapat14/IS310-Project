Mathematically about half of the voted for Trump.,Afraid_Sample1688,2025-05-05T08:07:47,22
"The U.S. Department of Education will resume collecting on defaulted student loans on Monday.  More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, according to the Trump administration.  The federal government has extraordinary collection powers on its student loans and it can seize borrowers’ tax refunds, paychecks and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.",IWantPizza555,2025-05-05T08:16:34,7
I’m not in default (yet) but tbh garnishing my wages would be cheaper than paying what I’ll be required to pay,HolidayNothing171,2025-05-05T13:54:34,3
Lined up with the 145% price increases.,30mil,2025-05-05T13:12:19,1
Probably a 3rd. It’s easy to forget ~40% of the eligible voters sit out every presidential election.,zffjk,2025-05-05T08:16:43,15
I’m all for getting the PPP loans back.,Pretend-Excuse-8368,2025-05-05T08:20:14,11
Isn't that crazy?  How about a day off and mandatory voting?   That's common in other democracies.,Afraid_Sample1688,2025-05-05T08:21:41,7
That is implicitly voting for who otherwise wins. So in my mind they voted for trump,wanzeo,2025-05-05T12:39:01,2
And college education inversely correlates with voting republican.,Deinosoar,2025-05-05T08:56:00,1
Yea I’m all for mandatory voting and a voting holiday. I’m even for penalties for not voting like community service or a tax fine or something.   The strategic minds in conservative world know that voter disenfranchisement is their only way to maintain power because of how unpopular it is to run a government that functionally drains your life to empower the rich.,zffjk,2025-05-05T08:25:22,9
That’s a valid take. Just don’t tell Trump that or he’ll have that mandate he keeps bringing up.,zffjk,2025-05-05T12:40:30,2
Good luck trying to be the party who puts that into law spin “vote or receive a penalty” into something that makes non voters want to vote for you. Maybe just stick with the day off for now. Or maybe just making it easier to vote with more days to do it or less restrictions on mail in.,More-Baseball9769,2025-05-05T09:07:44,5
Yea I’d be a shitty politician.,zffjk,2025-05-05T10:32:31,3
