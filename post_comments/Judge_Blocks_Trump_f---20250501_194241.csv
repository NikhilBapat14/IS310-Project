The judge was appointed by Trump in 2018.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-01T21:32:34,113
"Trump appointed Fauxi as well, and look how that turned out. Trump admitted himself that he didn’t make the best choices in people since he didn’t know how the whole thing worked. Now that he saw the weasels himself, I hope he won’t make the same mistakes.   Also, lefties tried blocking the appointment and now cheering the decision. So your logic goes both ways. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T03:46:46,15
