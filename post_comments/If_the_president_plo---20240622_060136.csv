There will be no VP until the president nominates someone and they are confirmed by both houses of congress.,darek97,2024-06-22T10:25:30,24
"25th Amendment: the President nominates a Vice President, and a majority of both houses of Congress must approve it. It happened in 1973, after Spiro Agnew resigned as VP.  Edit: there is no interim VP. And thereâ€™s no specified period at which the President must nominate a VP, or in which Congress must confirm the nomination. If something happens to the President before a VP is confirmed, the Speaker of the House is next in line.",phoarksity,2024-06-22T13:45:10,15
"No. As others have mentioned, the new President would nominate someone that Congress would then vote on.  The Vice Presidency is not an actually very important office in a modern context. An active VP is either poltically supporting the President or casting a bunch of tie breaking votes in the Senate.  If the concern is having someone to replace the President if their is no VP, their is a whole list of people who would become Acting President, and honestly if we reach the bottom of that list the world is probably coming to an end.",Shakezula84,2024-06-29T18:36:59,1
"I saw this happen twice in the span of a few short years. Agnew had to be replaced because he resigned, then, when Ford moved up due to Nixon's resignation,  Rocky was nominated and confirmed.",Swiggy1957,2024-06-22T22:20:56,11
"Wait so if biden plopped over and died in 2025 (assuming he wins), kamala harris can't just pick a VP, even as the most powerful person on the planet? it STILL has to go through both houses of congress? what happens if the Cons keep denying her pick?",[deleted],2024-06-23T01:03:52,4
what happens if Kamala harris picks someone for VP but the house majority republicans keep denying her pick? how do they advance?,[deleted],2024-06-23T01:04:45,2
"Yes, this is something that the total revanchist breakdown of the GOP would make extremely daunting. You'd hope she'd resist the temptation to nominate somebody like Manchin.  It's worth noting that Nixon chose Ford because 1) he was extremely well liked personally on both sides of the aisle and/but 2) nobody, including Ford himself, thought he had the chops to be President, thereby making him the same sort of ""insurance policy"" against impeachment Nixon had in Spiro Agnew.",JoeBourgeois,2024-06-25T08:45:09,4
"There's no Vice President until a majority of the House of Representatives, and a majority of the house of Senators (aka the Senate), confirms the nomination. If either or both houses refuse to confirm nominations for VP, and something happens to the President, the line of succession continues to the Speaker of the House of Representatives.",phoarksity,2024-06-23T08:02:22,8
"They'd stick at an impasse until someone decided to get together and find a pick that everyone can agree upon.  The branches of government are co-equal, one isn't there to rubber stamp the other's decisions.",AuditorTux,2024-06-23T18:32:11,2

President and VP can't be from the same state (which is why Cheney moved his voter registration to Wyoming in 2000).,JoeBourgeois,2024-06-25T08:47:03,2
