FL Dems won't be relevant statewide for a long time as it has gone from a swingy state to a vote sink for the GOP. They can compete in certain congressional districts but statewide is a money waster just as it would be for a GOPer trying to get elected statewide in Colorado (which went from swingy to a Dem vote sink since weed was legalized).   Best thing FL Dems could do is get a charismatic Spanish-speaking moderate (like Ruben Gallego in AZ) to be its new executive director who can rebuild the party by running decent candidates in winnable state legislative and congressional districts over the next 10 years,RosetteNewcomb,2025-05-01T15:13:51,4
