"Let's attack this from the monetary perspective.  NIH research died for this parade.  Medicaid is being threatened for this parade.  Grocery prices are going higher for this parade.  Libraries and museums are being defunded for this parade.  And on, and on, and on.  Edit: - Education services for disabled students - citizens' legal rights to not be defrauded by banks - your water is poisoned, for this parade - your job was cut for this parade.",ICanLiftACarUp,2025-04-08T00:01:35,91

"He‚Äôs getting ahead of himself.  This is a blunder we can capitalize on.   He (luckily) doesn‚Äôt have the base yet he needs to make the jump to dictator. This is just going to wake up people who are still asleep.  I yearn for the day my YouTube is filled with attack ads showing this parade next to a video montage of all the other fascist parades around the world that came before it (you know in China, Korea, Russia, Nazi Germany).  The more I think about it, the better this is. If the economy is still in shambles when he starts celebrating, it will make the fall out even worse.",zenmogwai,2025-04-08T07:15:10,13

We need to throw a wrench in this narcissistic bullshit. Like swarm the streets with protests and force that pig fuck to clear them out so his shitty parade can proceed. The optics would be devastating for him.,HaxanWriter,2025-04-08T07:39:11,7

"Just genuinely curious.. with such a long parade how does one ensure that all angles and portions of this parade is safe for someone to be trotted down the road?

This  I say let him have his parade.    Nothing says fascism quite like having tanks and missiles parade past a dictator‚Äôs review stage.   The footage will be used in attack ads to bury MAGAs and Republicans for the next hundred years.,guttanzer,2025-04-08T02:20:03,30
