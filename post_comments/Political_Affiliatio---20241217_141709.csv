"The things your professors are saying didn't used to be controversial. They were just the generally agreed upon reality. The politicization of all social science is a very recent phenomenon. Conservatism in America has associated intellectualism with the left and thus made it an enemy to fight against.  Sometimes there aren't two reasonable sides to an argument. Unreasonable arguments aren't worth discussing except as the subject of sociological study. Legitimizing new bad ideas by giving them a seat at the table just because a bunch of people started believing in these bad ideas is not how academics works.  There's also the subject of the Paradox of Tolerance (a concept made famous by Karl Popper in his book *The Open Society and its Enemies*, which I think would be an excellent book for sating your curiosity). If you legitimize people whose goal is to destroy places where ideas are made just because ""destroying this place"" is also an idea, then you will inevitably lose the place where ideas are made. Thus it is rational and consistent for open societies to suppress those who want to destroy open societies.",Volsunga,2024-12-17T15:18:04,35
"I'm curious to know what ideas you specifically think your professors were not open to and in what ways they showed.        As someone getting a PhD, my experience of academia is that it is deeply conservative, not ""Republican,"" but a series of institutions deeply invested in capitalism and the status quo of American life[. Some disciplines may lean left (anthropology, English), but some lean right (economics, business](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40823273_Politics_and_Professional_Advancement_Among_College_Faculty)). Sexism, homophobia, and racism remain rampant.        [This article](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/27/research-confirms-professors-lean-left-questions-assumptions-about-what-means) goes into research that shows that while very few academics identify as Conservative, more identify as moderate than liberal. It also goes into research on discrimination in higher education hiring and PhD admissions and says most studies **find no evidence of discrimination against conservatives in Higher Ed.** (The lack of conservatives appears to be a result of fewer conservatives seeking to enter higher education, which might be a self-fulfilling prophecy)      DEI itself is not a progressive project; it is an institutional attempt to get ahead of criticism and co-opt and neuter activism          I suggest you take a look at the book [Imperial University: Academic Repression and Scholarly Dissent](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816680900/the-imperial-university/), which explores this thoroughly",loselyconscious,2024-12-17T15:44:45,22
"I'm not familiar with the Paradox of Tolerance or The Open Society and its Enemies so I won't comment on either.  I am curious as to whom decides which group's goal is ""destroying places where ideas are made""?  Fifty to sixty years ago the likely target would have been the New Left (or earlier still the labor movement), and I suspect neither of us would have wanted that movement delegitimized by the powers that be.",Substantial-Data7896,2024-12-27T10:37:30,1
"I think economics professors lean left of society, but not as left as other fields as table 2 on your chart shows.",Whiterabbit--,2024-12-17T16:31:16,1
"They probably vote for Democrats more than the broader public, but the ideologies that are hegemonic in most Economic departments are hard-right libertarian.",loselyconscious,2024-12-17T16:45:46,3
"I think it's worth noting the study you referenced, Politics and Professional Advancement Among College Faculty, is nearly 20 years old.  I suspect the results in Economics have changed significantly - especially following the 2008-09 global recession.",Substantial-Data7896,2024-12-27T10:45:39,3
