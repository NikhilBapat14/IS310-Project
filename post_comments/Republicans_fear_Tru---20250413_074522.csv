"Well, I‚Äôll tell you this: I was Republican prior to 2016, and have voted a couple lower level republicans in the past. Now, I not only have vowed to not even consider voting Republican again, I refuse to even speak to my Republican family.

"It is vital that the 2026 midterms repudiate Trump's attempts to destroy nearly 250 years of US democracy, freedom, and aspirational goals of equality of opportunity and healthcare for all.

"The article analyzes the tariff debacle as if the main effect will be a straight tax increase.  It won‚Äôt.  The major effect will be this elective trade war, followed closely by fiscal/regulatory uncertainty at levels that we never see in peacetime.   These disruptions are going to put people out of work.  Small and medium sized businesses are going to go under.  Imported goods are going to become scarce and expensive, and export businesses are going to shrink dramatically.  Big businesses are going to stop investing and sit on their cash until Trump is out of office.  Founders will pause their startup dreams.   And we are going to have a tax increase.    (Well, 99% of us will.  The top 1% is scheduled for a major tax windfall.)  All of that is going to boomerang hard on the Republican Party.  All of it was by choice; some the P2025 fascists, and some from Elon Muskovich‚Äôs destruction, and some just Trump‚Äôs moronic delusions.  The Republicans are enabling all of this, and the public will remember for generations.",guttanzer,2025-04-13T08:22:31,45

"I disagree; Trump issued the punitive tariffs on Mexico and Canada by citing a bogus illegal alien ""invasion' and importation of fentanyl, then claiming emergency powers to implement tariffs, which rightfully belons with Congress.  Of course importation of fentanyl from Mexico is a serious problem, but almost none comes in from Canada. It is questionable how much of the fentanyl coming in from Mexico is brought in by ""illegal aliens"" or by Americans. And, this is not a new issue; ""The French Connection"" was a 1971 film drama about New York detectives trying to stop importation of heroin from France. Duh.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-13T19:05:19,1

Look at the MAGA Republicans doing the exact same thing by calling blue state voters ""fake Americans"" and said voters telling the GOP to go pound sand by reminding them MAGA needs blue state voters through the House of Reps.
