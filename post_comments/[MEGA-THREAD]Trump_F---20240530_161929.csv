Guys a question he was only convicted for hush money right? Also I don't get it how hush money is like illegal like as far as I know (not from us) he paid some porn star money to f him and then paid more so she doesn't tell she f him but how is that illegal like isn't this common in US especially Vegas money people do this (I know it's ethically and morally wrong and 8 agree it should also be illegal),No_Disk_6915,2024-11-07T16:51:41,1

">If (when) there is an appeal will the sentencing still take place or be bumped?  It will depend on what the appeal is for and how it is adjudicated.  For example, one protest I saw during the trial is that the ""felony"" that made the otherwise misdemeanors felonies as well (and extended the statue of limitations) was never revealed to Trump or his defense and was then referenced only in the closing.  Some say that's a Sixth Amendment violation.  Whether or not that's true in reality, let's say that a court rules before July that it is in fact a violation.  They could set aside the entire trial and make Bragg start entirely anew, in which case the sentencing would be cancelled.

"I mean, that is essentially it. But it’s not like it was an accident, he was intentionally lying on documents to disguise what the money was for.   He slept with Stormy Daniels.  Eventually he directs Cohen to make hush money payments to her and gets her to sign an NDA (not illegal)  When paying Cohen they lie on the business records to make it seem like the money was for something else. (Illegal)  That in and of itself is a misdemeanor crime. The DA upgraded it to a felony because under state law if you’re falsifying records to aid in the commission of another crime it can become a felony charge.   There’s so many counts because he paid Cohen in payments and falsified each payment. For a total of 34 falsified payments/documents.

The defense attorney accused Cohen of lying but he didn't prove it. If he had proved it then it would have had an effect. It was about discussing both the stormy payment and some prank calls a 14 year old made with Trump in a short phonecall. The truth is there was no way of proving that and Cohen put himself under oath to allege it and the defense didn't put Trump under oath to dispute it.,YolognaiSwagetti,2024-05-31T10:47:35,5
"The jury had to determine whether they felt Cohen was trustworthy. Clearly they felt like he was trustworthy in this instance.   The defense attempted to convince the jury that Trump never slept with Stormy Daniels, never approved Cohen to make hush money payments, and that Cohen did it on his own free will without Trumps knowledge.   None of which the jury found very believable. They found cohen more trustworthy than Trump.

">Normally, political pressure from shame/scandal would force him out.  Like it or not, the accusations, timing and everything about the case *was not normal*.  The actions he was convicted of occurred in 2017.  Normally they'd be outside the statute of limitations, but New York has a kicker that makes them felonies if they occurred to further some *other* felony as well.  And if you think you're being targeted, that changes the perception.  There are other things that make you stand up and go ""Hmmm...""  * The judge - Merchan - was picked at random for this trial... and two others involving Trump.  The pool of judges to draw from is over 1000.  That's incredible odds.  [At least some think this really wasn't random](https://nypost.com/2024/05/28/us-news/elise-stefanik-files-misconduct-complaint-against-judge-juan-merchan-over-random-assignment-to-trumps-trial/) * Bragg's case never really said what the other felony was.  It was not introduced into evidence or by any witness and only referenced in his closing (they offered three).  And remember that Bragg is an state officer, not federal, so it must be another *state* felony.  (Otherwise things are going to get messy as Texas can start enforcing federal laws... immigration anyone?).  This could be a Sixth Amendment issue, as others have said. * We have a bit of legal history with this.  The jury for John Edwards - who *solicited money from donors to pay his* hush money - was declared a mistrial.  Just because a personal expense might benefit a candidate politically, that doesn't mean its considered a political contribution to his or her campaign - its called the ""[irrespective test](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements/personal-use/)"".  The trick here - and with John Edwards - is whether Trump would have made that payment if he wasn't a candidate.  What gets even trickier is that this issue might not have even come up if he wasn't a candidate.  But given Trump has used NDAs and payments for those NDAs (required as ""consideration""), its hard to tell. * And then there's the jury instructions that I've seen people say is a huge deal, a medium deal, nothing at all, a distraction and everything in between.  But there is a requirement that the entire series of crimes must be unanimous and the instructions said otherwise.  I'm not enough of a lawyer to be able to dig into that.  But this is *absolutely* going to be appealed and once those appeals are exhausted, we'll see where the dust settles.  One thing we all know - this isn't done by a long shot.  The question is whether at least the first level of appeals will be done by the election.",LordFoxbriar,2024-05-31T11:12:42,-3

Poor people can't afford those kinds of lawyers, so they are more likely to get screwed by the system than wealthy people.  Trump is something of an exception this time; he's got a lot of money and he hired some expensive lawyers, but it didn't get him off (appeals notwithstanding).

For example, lots of accused in the US are held in jail, even though due process has not yet been completed. It sucks, but it happens. Same thing if you get arrested. A police officer gets to make the decision to take away your freedom without due process... for a period of time. Not permanently. But when you are on trial, some rights are taken away temporarily. That's just how it works.",Mr_Funbags,2024-05-31T16:52:02,4
"Don’t forget to add the judge donated to the Biden campaign (real thing that actually happened), and I believe Bragg or a higher up of his ram to “get trump”, I can’t remember so don’t quote me, but somebody involved in the prosecution ran on the basis of “getting Donald trump”",Striking-Ad2366,2024-06-10T17:44:23,1
"No Trump's legal team asked for a venue change and was denied.   Former FEC Commissioner Brad Smith wasn't allowed to testify on Trump's behalf. Smith would have testified that ""Trump didn't violate any federal election laws"". Brad Smith is a Clinton appointee. His testimony would have been very helpful for the defense.   Judge Juan M. Merchan should have recused himself.  New York law 100.3 e(1)d(iii) states ""a judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might be reasonably questioned"".  Judge Merchan's daughter is a major democratic party operative. Loren Merchan is the president of a political consulting firm with clients like Rep. Adam Schiff (Democrat).   Not only must judges be neutral, they must appear so as well.  The judge's daughter raising millions of dollars for Biden's campaign is enough to question his impartiality.",MassiveAd1026,2024-06-05T12:20:36,1
"Firstly, Trump NEVER declassified those documents when he was President , he could have done what Obama did and legally gets those classified file made available to the public but Trump never did. As such he have zero authority to take those documents and made  them his personal property .  Funnily enough he claimed  he can still declassify those file as citizen Trump , but we all know the truth .   Secondly , nowhere in Hur trancipst where he ever said Biden knew he had classified documents he was not supposed to have, in fact Hur seem to imply that Biden memory problems made him believe wrongly in the nature of those documents . This is contrast with Trump who does seem to know about the type  documents he poses , he literally bragged about them to his guest prior to the FBI raid. Hur made that clear  when he compared Trump to Biden  in his testimony in front of the House committee.   Thirdy  you are still ignoring the biggest difference between Trump and all the rest of the people who mishandled classified folders before: ALL  of them save for Trump cooperated and surrendered the documents they have on them when it was  requested that they return them. Trump on the other hand lied about what he have in possession and tried to hide them .  Had Trump did what Hillary, Pence , Biden  did he could probably ""get away""  like they did, but instead  he chose the dumbest and the most unnecessarily criminal way to handle things .",Nourjan,2024-06-05T14:47:38,2
">The courts strictly scrutinize gag orders.  Gag orders must be limited to the facts of the case and being prior restraint, are generally unconstitutional *except* that in this case, there are also competing rights as well - such as to a fair trial (when gag orders are applied to witnesses and such) which is precisely why we got *[New York Times Co. v United States](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States)*[Nebraska Press Association v. Stuart](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nebraska_Press_Ass%27n_v._Stuart)*.  However these mostly apply to the *press* rather than the defendant themselves.  Short of witness tampering, how could Trump threaten his own fair trial?  I mean, I guess insulting the jury members but prior restraint against someone themselves?  That's like forcing someone to take the 5th when they want to talk...  >It seems that you are desperately trying to find the smallest threads in an attempt to unravel what was quite honestly, a very straightforward case.  I might not be a litigator but two years to build a case that basically comes down to bad business reports shows it wasn't so much gathering evidence but rather finding the theory.

"Venue change request is denied all the time in plenty of cases , there is nothing unique to Trump in this regard.  Most of the time  there isn't really any valid reason for such request , ths same goes here.      Brad Smith was never barred from testifying, it took me less than a minute of googling to see this myth debunked. What happened was Trump's own attorneys chose to not call him to the stand after Judge  Merchan ordered that his testimony be pertinent .   This was jury trial , Judge  Merchan have no say whatsoever on the jury's verdict. Had this be a bench trial  then I would have  agree that he should have recused himself , but this is not the case . After all, if the presiding judge showed enough bias , then Trump lawyer should show that on appeal.",Nourjan,2024-06-05T13:53:59,2
"There is no legal process for a president to declassify information.  He *did* declassify those documents.  He said as much.  It’s funny you try to discredit Hur when he literally exonerated Biden.  So you only count things he says when it supports your side, but if it hurts your side, then that statement doesn’t count lol  Biden told ghost writers they were classified himself, in as much of a “bragging” fashion as you accuse Trump.

">What happened was Trump's own attorneys chose to not call him to the stand after Judge Merchan ordered that his testimony be pertinent .  Its not quite that.  Merchan [limited what he could testify about](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/05/20/trump-hush-money-criminal-trial/judge-limits-trumps-expert-00158857):  > But the judge ruled this morning that allowing Smith to testify expansively on that topic would supplant the judge's role to determine what the law is.  >“There is no question this would result in a battle of the experts, which will only serve to confuse, and not assist, the jury,” Merchan declared near the beginning of today's court session.  >Merchan did not block Trump from calling Smith, a former member of the Federal Election Commission. But the judge said he’d be restricted to the basics of the FEC and to “general definitions and terms” in campaign finance law, like what counts as a contribution or expenditure.  The point many have said is the ""battle of experts"" is *exactly* the point of calling him to explain just that - no one really knows if what Trump did with the hush money is a crime.  [John Edwards famously did the same and his trial resulted in one not guilty verdict and the rest a mistrial](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/John_Edwards_extramarital_affair#Legal_proceedings).  ETA: (I can complete thoughts!  I promise)  The basis of the elevation of the charges from misdemeanors to felonies is that they were done to advance another felony which, most think, is the campaign finance issue that the hush money would be.  But if allowed to testify that it might not be a felony, and certainly not assured it is, then the charges might collapse.",AuditorTux,2024-06-05T15:06:50,1
"Firstly certain documents  can be declassified by an outgoing President if   they intend to take them with  out of office. There is an official way to do this and we have seen it  done as latest as Obama at  end of his term.  I don't know where  you get  the myth  that Trump declassified those documents when he never did, Trump never even attempted that process on any of the one with him, including those that he can easily declassify . The reason why he is in legal trouble isn't just  because  he illegally possessed those documents, it because  tried to illegally keep them . Also taking Trump words at face value  is hilarious considering he is a notorious  habitual compulsive  liar. I mean just a few days ago he claims he never said lock Hillary up during his campaign for Presidency.       If you think Hur exonerated Biden, then you wouldn't  use him to paint a false equivalency between Trump and Biden. It seems very, very obvious that you never read the transcript of Hur's interrogation of Biden ,  his own report or even watched the House committee's session with Hur . Hur contradicted himself multiple in in those.     You keep on ignoring that fact that when Biden said that, he doesn't' seem to be aware that he should not have those documents and  yet still didn't he allow the ghosts writer to see those documents ,   unlike Trump who literally handed them to his guest . Trump's bragging on the other hand also  happened  after he explicitly told to return those documents multiple  times, so he was aware that he wasn't  supposed to have those at that point .   Again, Trump NEVER declassified those documents he stole. Just like Biden and Hillary , he was legally obligated to return them .Unlike Biden,  Pence Hillary ,  he didn't  complied. At that point it it crosses the line from gross negligence to actual criminal  intent.  Every  administration as  far back as Reagan have records of them mishandling and ""misplacing""  sensitive documents , none of them did what Trump did after he was notified of his wrongdoings .   There is zero legal basis for you to claim Trump didn't need to return those documents. That notion is as credible as saying the Earth is flat.",Nourjan,2024-06-06T01:15:58,2
"*There is no official required process for a president to declassify*.  He’s *the* head of the executive branch, which is over classifications in the first place.  He can declassify things at will.  It is his constitutional authority.  Some processes have been created around certain declassifications, but none of them are legally binding.  I literally did read the transcript for when Hur interviewed Biden.  The audio recording is going to be released soon, something the Biden admin is fighting strongly against.  Gee I wonder why.  If he’s so untrustworthy, then I suppose you’d support another prosecutor investigating the case?",LambDaddyDev,2024-06-06T02:16:47,1
"There are official process for **ANY**  presidents to  declassify  documents and there are even paper trails that confirms this , the fact that such document will no longer be classified in the biggest proof that the process have been successfully applied. Trump can **ONLY** declassify them when he was President, he lost that power and privilege the moment he's  no longer The President .   Again, Trump **NEVER**  declassified any of the documents he took after he left office, he could declassify some of them  as any moment he was still in power  but he **NEVER** did so . *He illegally possess them and illegally tried to keep in his possession after he was requested to return them*   .  If you read the transcripts then you would know that Hur was wrong when he falsely claimed  Biden couldn't  remember his son's death .  You would also recall reading Hur praising Biden  for having  good mental faculty.  While I  support releasing the actual recording, there is practically zero  chance that actual recording would contradict the transcripts  ,hence  that would be another waste of time and taxpayer's money .  Speaking of wasting  taxpayers'  money, assigning another prosecutors is also pointless as  will not gain any new incriminating evidence other that what they have now . Remember , Biden and his people surrendered all the documents they had in their possession  Again, had Trump cooperated and  yielded all those document like those before him , he would probably never be prosecuted and will get away with this.",Nourjan,2024-06-07T01:42:44,1
