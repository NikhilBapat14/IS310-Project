Most of us know what's going on but worth the read. This is truely awful stuff and makes me sick to think our country is flaunting this as if it's a great thing.,2way10,2025-04-30T10:28:14,6

"Here's a gift link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuela-el-salvador.html?unlocked\_article\_code=1.Dk8.kZEv.WqZTSxhdv-E9&smid=url-share](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/us/politics/trump-deportations-venezuela-el-salvador.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Dk8.kZEv.WqZTSxhdv-E9&smid=url-share)  I just want to point out that this is the type of reporting the media should do more of. The public needs this detailed reporting. It's shameful that the deal with El Salvador has gone on behind the scenes, but thankfully we do know some details thanks to this and other reports!  I don't even know what to comment on specifically. There are so many details here and I'm just going through it. But it's clear that both the US government and Salvadoran government are... less than honest.  I don't have high hopes that anyone will be held accountable for any of it, but I know that Judges Boasberg and Xinis are in the process. Hope they don't give up.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T11:15:06,4

"Yesterday I posted about how I wont befriend a trump supporter and some MAGAt replied saying I was being toxic and anti-social.  Shit like this is why I dont want MAGAts in my life.  We can disagree about guns and taxes.  But I dont want to ""disagree"" with someone about dissapearing people into concentration camps.",StashedandPainless,2025-04-30T10:55:16,1
He's sending them to El Salvador so a dictator can use them as leverage against Venezuela. It's human trafficking.,g2g079,2025-04-30T11:15:26,1
"That El Salvador is shady should worry people even more about the US collaborating with them. I’m positive we are not getting all of the details, which is even more troubling, not that we have ever had a transparent government, but this is extreme- and getting worse.",justtots,2025-04-30T15:01:55,1
