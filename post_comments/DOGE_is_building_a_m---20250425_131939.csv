DOGE is the investigation arm of the oligarchs. There is a near endless tax base available (the Uber wealthy). But we focus on squeezing more out of the low/middle class.  The only way to them is by starving them of money which brings power. If folks can't see these actions as a reason to vote... Then vote then at least vote with your wallet.,williamgman,2025-04-25T17:39:42,1
