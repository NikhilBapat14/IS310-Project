"There actually was a recent poll done for that particular Senate seat in Georgia. It was solely a Republican voter poll. She came in fourth out of four people. Not only did she come in last, but part of the poll put her against Jon Ossoff (who's also not that popular among those voters) and that was the only match up that put Ossoff over 50%, with it being 54% to 37%. Farron Cousins did a video that broke down the poll, I'll link it below.  But it shows, thankfully, that she might only be safe in her district with no chance of winning a Senate seat or higher.  https://youtu.be/3giCq959Mjs?si=cEsBufuDLHNz2Efe",Vilehaust,2025-05-06T19:20:51,3
"No, and her running gives Jon Ossoff the best odds of holding his seat.  MTG is the perfect candidate for Dems to take the Senate in 2026, because she's hated by everyone outside the MAGA base. She's only in Congress because she lives in an extremely deep red House district full of rednecks.  Winning a state wide race as a Republican in Georgia means not pissing off Atlanta and it's suburbs. Which she absolutely has done, and will do.",CrashB111,2025-05-06T13:35:32,6

She might win the primary but to win the senate seat she would need appeal in the cities Georgia voted for Ossoff over Herschel Walker.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-06T15:05:25,5
"Pretty sure polling showed she would crush a Republican Primary against anyone not named Brian Kemp.  Only to turn around and have the worst odds of all potential candidates against Ossoff in the General.

Ossoff ran against Perdue here for Senate.  Walker ran against Warnock and lost in the run-off to him. MTG would have a rough time against either of the current senators here.   Ossoff needs to worry about Raffensberger the most because he has the ability to pull in suburban voters that respect him for standing up to Trump.,Whats_a_wincondition,2025-05-06T15:45:11,2
