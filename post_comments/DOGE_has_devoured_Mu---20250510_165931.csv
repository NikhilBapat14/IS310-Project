"What a stupid article.  Federal employees were upset that many were being fired? Thank you, I would have never guessed.  Last month the treasury borrowed $53 billion less than it had anticipated. Thats a massive savings for a month, and it occurred despite leftist judges trying to force the government to waste money.  Elon knowingly put his own wealth at risk for the good of the country. It doesn’t help Tesla to anger the left, but he did it because he thought it was the right thing to do.",dunkeater,2025-05-10T17:59:55,13
"Upvote for Unherd and also because it's a good article. It's predominantly the reason Ramaswamy left DOGE. He realized very quickly Musk was using this for his own ends, rather than the good of the Republic, and didn't want to be associated with it or its unconstitutional focuses.",HotShot345,2025-05-10T17:16:50,-8
