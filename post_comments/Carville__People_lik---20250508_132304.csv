"After saying this, Carville then cackled and said “I’ll defeat you next time, Batman!” before riding a skeleton themed bicycle away, ringing the bell in time with his cackles.  Seriously though, how long is Carville going to milk his work on the Bill Clinton campaign to make him out as some sort of expert for the Democratic party? I thought ten years after Clinton’s presidency ended would have been more than enough.",AmrokMC,2025-05-08T13:24:45,17
"Carville, who was last relevant 30 years ago, is definitely more trouble than *he's* worth",pierre_x10,2025-05-08T13:27:29,11
"Can't stand Carville for decades now (his despicable wife is even worse) and wish he would also stfu and go away, but on this, about this particular person...he's that ""broken clock"" thing....",HPLREH777,2025-05-08T13:41:02,4

"“Said Carville” through one of the many face wrinkles that may have been his mouth. “The last time carville is believed to have opened his withered mouth hole was 90 days ago when he declared that if Dems would just lie back and take it, republicans would self destruct on their own in exactly 30 days. It was an amazing feat of prognostication for the “raging Cajun” and known raisin headed goon as exactly 30 days later the Republican Party walked into a tar pit and disappeared.",xyz_rick,2025-05-08T14:01:57,1
"And there we are, a point that's been brought up a lot in the last two weeks is the under-reporting of right wing violence and terrorism in the US (she's right, we can make it is the vast majority). So here we have it exactly precisely defined: we can't do anything about it it because what if they don't vote for us?! Also wouldn't want to make em mad since you know they have guns and bombs.   Fucking ridiculous.",shoobe01,2025-05-08T13:49:28,0
"This is good. We need to have a power struggle in the party. We need the progressive wing to battle against the traditionalists, and we need to people to judge who better realizes and will work on our very real issues.   Being fake and just getting along has gotten us to this point. Fuck it, let's fight. I have faith that Omar, Bernie, and AOC will win the hearts of the base over any Clintonians.   I like Carville, but he no longer has his finger on the pulse of the nation.",rogozh1n,2025-05-08T14:34:51,0

The phrase “from the river to the sea” also appears in the founding documents of Israel’s ruling Likud Party.  The phrase is clearly subject to a power struggle. I wouldn’t say it stands straightforwardly for anything at this point.,Logical_Hare,2025-05-08T13:54:56,6
