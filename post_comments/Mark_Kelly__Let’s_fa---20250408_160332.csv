I think much of the damage is already done. Why would anyone trust us again? Americans could just vote in another Trump at any time.,Riversmooth,2025-04-08T18:22:19,25
Trump knows exactly what he‚Äôs doing. He‚Äôs tanking the economy so real estate prices and stock prices plummet so he and his billionaire buddies can get even wealthier. This is the definition of corruption.,GaSoufan,2025-04-08T21:04:41,20
He‚Äôs doing this intentionally. He wants this,Logical_Bite3221,2025-04-08T16:47:42,19
"Mark, let's face it, Trump and his team absolutely understand what they are doing and wrecking the economy and then declaring martial law is part of the plan.",KeithGribblesheimer,2025-04-08T16:32:41,14
Trumps tariffs are illegal. He is calling everything a national emergency so he can bypass any checks or balances,Kind-City-2173,2025-04-08T16:22:44,13

"Just to be clear, he has wrecked our economy and set us back a decade if we remove him right now and prove to the rest of the world we've learned our lesson. Wreck our economy is going to feel like a gross underrepresentation of what we are going to experience.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-08T16:22:31,11
"Trump never knew what to do in life, me in the only knew how to destroy things. He always had his daddy‚Äôs money and he knew how to throw tantrums and bully people into submission.   The world ain‚Äôt fucking around and definitely not putting up with his shit.   Until rich billionaires and general population of the US wakes up and marches in millions to DC and scream until his whiney asshole puckers up, he‚Äôs gonna continue doing this shit.",monsterdiv,2025-04-08T18:00:48,11
I know it looks that way but what if wrecking the economy is his very intention?,[deleted],2025-04-08T16:13:18,9

I'm wondering if any of those elected officials know what they're doing??? ü§î,RedRoom4U,2025-04-09T06:35:42,0
"My hope is the rest of the world can acknowledge this is all on Trump and doesn‚Äôt hold us all accountable for it.  *Yes, I know there‚Äôs 70+ million Americans to blame for this and another 70+ million to blame for doing nothing to stop it, plus a big long list of complicit assholes that kissed the rings to make this all possible.*  ‚Ä¶ but the rest of us deserve grace.",rykcon,2025-04-08T19:55:07,2
"If this is the plan, billionaires don‚Äôt seem to be on board with it, since their stock portfolios are getting crushed right now. I‚Äôm not suggesting that we should be sympathetic of billionaires suffering with everyone else who has a retirement portfolio, but it does appear that they were not clued in in advance that Trump was going to do these incredibly stupid tariffs and tank the stock market and the economy.",NotoriousFTG,2025-04-09T01:46:59,3
Dont forget so he can declare a state of emergency - giving himself full and utter control.,Jakesma1999,2025-04-09T03:55:59,3
This. Exactly this. And until more Democrat officials realize this we are all screwed. You don‚Äôt take the threat seriously when you don‚Äôt understand the depth of your enemy‚Äôs intentions.,watkinator,2025-04-09T00:21:25,4
I think so! Maybe it‚Äôs to drive down share cost so investors can monopolize.,mlineras,2025-04-08T17:45:31,5
The way he is behaving is an actual national emergency. We are in a crisis. I think he‚Äôs seriously has lost his mind or he‚Äôs crashing the market for the elite to benefits on affordable shares.,mlineras,2025-04-08T17:47:14,5
It's gonna be a national emergency that's called when the next guy has him and his cronies sent to El Salvador at the rate he's going.,Plaid_Piper,2025-04-08T16:38:41,4
"IAAL. There is another lawyer I am up against frequently. Local guy. Real asshole. The type who flips out and screams at you in open court. The type who won‚Äôt return a call that could resolve a case 2 months out because he wants to bill his client for every cent he can bleed out of them. The type who will come to mediation with the position ‚Äúmy client will give nothing.‚Äù   Yet eventually things settle with him. He talks a big game, flips out during motion arguments, mother fucks you up and down the local bar, but ultimately comes back to the table and you get a deal that you likely would‚Äôve landed at had negotiations proceeded in a normal and professional manner.  A few years back it hit me: this guy is Trump. He is a petulant, spoiled, 60 year old man-child who has always gotten his way, throws tantrums, and eventually people give him a little bit so they don‚Äôt have to deal with the grown asshole throwing a temper tantrum. Then he can feel like the big man who screamed his way to victory, even though he could‚Äôve gotten that ‚Äî and more ‚Äî had he simply negotiated like a sane person.   People like this are built different. They are fundamentally broken. Every interaction they have with other humans is transactional and they have to view themselves as ‚Äúwinning‚Äù any exchange, even one as simple as ‚Äúgood morning Bob, how are you?‚Äù.   The good news is that these people are very easy to manipulate once you realize who they are and how they operate, as their entire personality is so self-defeating that very few of them reach positions of actual influence and are, at best, mild pests who you can laugh about after ending the interaction.  The bad news is that these people are very easy to manipulate and make great blunt instruments for smarter bad faith actors in positions of influence who want to use them to sow chaos (like a certain Russian dictator with POTUS).",MattTheSmithers,2025-04-08T19:19:32,8
