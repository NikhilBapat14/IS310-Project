"When I consider the actions of this administration I am regularly reminded of the organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville. A coalition of hate groups, emboldened by a Trump victory, took to the streets spewing the most awful bile you can imagine, killing a counter-protestor, and in doing so exposed themselves to a country that had been flirting with fascism but wasn't ready to take the plunge. The backlash, legal challenges, and the fact that it was always a mix of volatile personalities and ideologies fractured the group, it's members disgraced and in and out of court for the next several years. The follow-up the next year failed spectacularly.  It is terrifying that it went from a group of internet nazis to the actual federal government, but the effect is similar. A hateful movement gaining false confidence in the belief that, because one con man is in office, they have achieved a cultural victory and America is ready for white Christian nationalism. But they aren't, low information voters just didn't like the last guy and his replacement seemed too much like him. They want cheaper groceries and higher wages, not the kidnapping of legal residents and PhD students.  People who were not entirely politically conscious becoming aware of the actual evil that is at the heart of the MAGA movement.

"I was looking at a paper once that was showing who made more money and who made less during Democratic and Republican presidential administrations. As one might expect, the poor in the middle class did better under Democrats. But the very rich also did better, although I suppose that they might have lost some of that gain through higher taxes. During Republican administrations, the poor in the middle class generally lost money, and the very wealthy made more. What really struck me though was that they did not make as much more money as they would have under a Democrat. Their gains were smaller when Republicans were in power.   I kind of puzzled over this for a while and then came to a conclusion :  The very rich don't actually care about making more money. What they care passionately about is that *nobody else should be making any money*.",Unique-Coffee5087,2025-04-28T18:53:59,3
