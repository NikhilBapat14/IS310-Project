Flrodia's farming and construction industries are coming to a grinding halt for sure,DeffNotTom,2025-04-27T10:18:13,1014
"If there were really 800 illegal criminal immigrants and terrorists just sitting around ripe for the picking, why did it take florida till now to round them up. It's not a sanctuary thing. It's not like this is a leftist state that harbors ""illegals"". If they had legitimate cause to arrest these people, they wouldn't need to wait for the Trump administration to do it.   Honestly, it's reasonable to assume that none of these people are the criminals they claim they are targeting.  These people weren't arrested. The headline should say 800 people were kidnapped by ICE and are being processed to be trafficked",auserhasnoname7,2025-04-27T12:52:46,547

">“There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.'” ― Isaac Asimov, 1980  We have the internet now literally in our back pocket. Willfully ignorant people are dangerous. It's OK to blame them. No one really wants to but other side of the coin no one wants them to be dangerous Republicans either.    Republicans are not going to stop themselves.    >Democrats play by the rules, and they cheat.  Democrats are politicians, not leaders. Like it or not but Trump can lead 77,000,000 people to vote Republican. Hillary couldn't. Kamala couldn't. Biden was ""break glass in case of emergency"".   Democrats have people that could very well rally all the not-Republicans. But they are not allowed to be leaders.   https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-great-new-society-post-trump-rcna202632   > So far, specifics for a Democratic future are light — and there’s plenty of disagreement. High-profile internal tensions erupted this past week after activist and Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg announced his outside political action committee would spend $20 million on primaries, in part to target “ineffective” Democratic incumbents. >  > At 25, Hogg is advocating for the party to shift its recruiting strategy to bring younger candidates into solid blue districts and oust largely older candidates. The plan prompted a rebuke from the DNC chair, who said officers should remain neutral. >  > Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist working with a handful of potential 2028 contenders, said he still feels it will “take a lot of coaching for Democrats to understand we cannot go back to the old system. That system was broken. It didn’t work for most Americans — and we were the ones defending it. People weren’t asking for a return to normal. They wanted change.” >  > “And sure, Trump made it worse. He’s created chaos, jacked up prices, lined his own pockets while everyone else struggles. But here’s the real danger: When we get back in power, the instinct will be to rebuild the old system. Rebuild USAID. Rebuild the broken institutions. Wrong move. If we do that, we’re going to give Republicans a massive opening in 2032 to elect someone way worse than Trump. If we play our cards right, we’ve got a rare shot — maybe a once-in-a-generation shot — to build something better.” >  > Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow said, “It should embarrass all of us that we are not building high-speed rail, we’re not finishing these housing projects,” she said, adding that Democrats must “actually deliver on the things that we believe in without putting so many hurdles and disconnected systems in place.”  >  > At a Nevada rally in March, Ocasio-Cortez called on the rank and file in her party to “choose and vote for Democrats and elected officials who know how to stand for the working class.”",tech57,2025-04-27T19:29:15,1
