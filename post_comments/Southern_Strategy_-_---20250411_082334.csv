"Not enough is discussed about the use of the ""southern strategy"" which historically focused on fueling the white southern vote and moving southerners from Democratic support to Republican.   ""The Southern strategy was a political tactic employed by the Republican Party in the mid-20th century to appeal to white Southern voters by exploiting racial tensions and opposition to civil rights advancements. The Republican Party’s implementation of the Southern strategy involved adopting conservative positions on issues such as states’ rights, law and order, and opposition to busing to gain support from Southern white voters who felt disenchanted with the Democratic Party’s embrace of civil rights. The Southern strategy significantly realigned the political landscape, leading to a shift in Southern states from predominantly Democratic to predominantly Republican, and ultimately shaping the party’s electoral strategy for decades to come.""",Lebarican22,2025-04-11T08:25:36,1
"“I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come.” - President Johnson after 1964 Civil Rights legislation.  2008 - America elected Barack Obama. Another Southern generation or two to work it out.  Just in case you thought the ""Southern Strategy"" was about something else.",YallerDawg,2025-04-11T08:30:09,1
Running on white everything has allowed the strategy to survive.,Lebarican22,2025-04-11T09:10:45,1
"I don't think this strategy works anymore, if it is blatant like it was in the past.  Look at what they are doing with DEI--they are branding it as illegal and discriminatory and saying that Equal Opportunity and merit-based are the true, legal, 'anti-racist' methods to use.   If social media existed in the 1980s, these far-right / alt-right influencers would be straight-up white power skinheads and supporters, and they wouldn't hide it. These days, they are doing a good job of keeping the racism part under the covers just like the Klan did in the early 1900s (they sold themselves as a pro-American, Protestant, organization that just happened to be all white. Peak membership neared some 7M members ... until a scandal broke and it was revealed that the Klan was mostly a group of degenerate hicks who, yes, despite saying they did not do this, actually were hanging black people, too.  Membership dropped down to like 30K or so overnight).    This becomes a bit more complicated with the younger generations who are more connected to a larger group of individuals of all types and it is only a matter of time before they separate the facts from the fiction.   Anyways, the GOP shot themselves in the foot.  For decades they ignored the black and brown vote, and only recently realized they need the brown vote to win future elections. This is largely why they want to restrict immigration, education, and so on.  Otherwise, they will need to stick with their tried and true tactic of gerrymandering.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T09:30:53,1
"I agree, but as someone who grew up in the south, there is more to it than you realize. The south doesn't like change and yes, a newer generation is more connected however they are being raised to continue the family traditions, including racism. If you look at the strategy of P 2025 and Heritage foundation, you will see how the ""southern strategy"" culturally speaking mirrors the old ways and plans to ensure their survival through state leadership and laws. South Carolina is becoming the example.   Please do underestimate how women are held down and raised to believe they have a place in the south. Their homes, church and now schools are being pushed to be in sync with the overall goal.",Lebarican22,2025-04-11T10:39:51,1
"That may be the case.  My point is that the U.S. overall has become far more progressive over the years, and looks to be a trend that is not reversing. I see what is happening more as a response to the understanding by the right, Heritage Foundation, etc. that this is their last stance; that they are fighting a losing battle and are doing what they can to hold on.   The ultimate irony of P25, Trumpism, etc. is that GOP figures like Chaney, Christie, Haley, etc. now seem reasonable compared to Trump, Vance, and possibly DeSantis (who is, for the most part, somewhere in-between). For the GOP as a political machine, this is a winning strategy.    But, assuming it is not Vance who wins in 2028 (also assuming Trump is legit out), even these establishment Republicans are not going to be as hardcore should one win.  I mean, I don't know about DeSantis, but I can see the rest restoring the fact that non-white people, or even white women, are capable of great things, and have done great things.   Trump won because of the male vote overall.  This was primarily driven by alpha male influencers who convinced a large chunk of impressionable young males that libs want nothing more than to take away what it means to be a 'man'.  When non-white males realize what is going on, they likely won't stick around.  When these young white males grow up a little bit more, they may realize there is more to it.   Social media may have fried many brains into I-can't-remember-what-happened-five-minutes-ago, but the collective, societal, memory tends to stick around.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T11:45:25,1
"I think how people evolve will depend on how they allow the information to be interpreted and applied. I don't see more maturity amongst the 18+ and depending on who becomes the role model, how they evolve could take decades.     This is what I wrote elsewhere about the US and how we ended up where we are...   ""In my opinion, the American cult problem is directly related to not having leadership and not being able to feel the positive effects of government in our daily lives. Many have talked about how lower levels of government make the most local impact, where less voting occurs.    My suggestion for my country is to accept we have a lot of followers. They are in need of sound guidance, not built on personal agenda. We need actual leaders that can do the job needed even when it isn't always positive for everyone.""",Lebarican22,2025-04-11T12:45:50,1
"Yes, this is how Trump can slash the Fed Gov despite it not saving money in the long run--because most people have no idea how government works, let alone the impact.  Here is something;  National Parks have (er, had) a yearly budget of around $3B.  But, they generated roughly $30B in revenue --essentially free money for the U.S.  MAGA won't know that.   Here is something else--right now there is communication freeze, in part relating to reporting numbers and figures.  Sicking with the National Parks, by not being allowed to print how many people, tourists, etc. visit National Parks is how they get away with cutting funding (because it is easier to claim 'no one uses them, anyways'.  Public opinion is powerful, but only when the voices can be heard.  Anyways, this is a tactic that both Parties use to rationalize cutting budgets.    The funny thing is, currently polling has roughly 2/3s of Republicans being in favor of National Parks and other public lands.   This is one of those things that is not fully realized until later in life -- many 18 - 20something year olds believe they know exactly how the world works, until that day comes when they realize they were wrong.    Anyways, yes, it is more about the local scene than the national governance.  This is why the GOP is really good at focusing on local elections --school boards, city / county races, State legislations, etc. The oddity of America is that most people identify with the micro before the macro--if you are on the East Coast or in the South, this could be the particular county, or town within the county, then the State, then the Region, then the Country except for those moments when it matters and Country comes first.   I dunno. I see social media as really screwing up a generation of people.  Not that this makes them bad people or anything, but just in how it changes the priorities.  New technology (my guess is VR / AR) is going to have Gen Alpha look at TikTok as stupid and out of touch as they navigate the world through AR all day.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T13:14:44,2
