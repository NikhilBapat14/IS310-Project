"Civilian control of the military, including the ability to fire or promote senior leadership has been strongly ingrained into the ethos of the officer corps.  It has also been hammered in since the very start and saw several stress tests. Notably Truman firing MacArthur over his handling of the Korean War, and Lincoln rotating through leaders of the Army of the Potomac in the Civil War.  The military as apolitical and deferential to elected leadership getting to choose who the bosses are is simply much more strongly held as a belief vs the military as some sort of constitutional backstop against domestic despotism.",DBHT14,2025-04-08T09:16:16,128

"Are you asking for a coup?   I would say it’s less about the generals and more about the environment. A country with a relatively new democracy is more ripe for a coup than one that has been in place for a while. Coups tend to happen in places that have had coups in the past.   Specifically about the US, one big reason is simply that the vast majority even among those who dislike Trump would be against a coup.",JonDowd762,2025-04-08T09:13:06,17
"You actually mean unwilling to do  rather than unable.    In the most basic sense it is history and culture.   The US was not founded around a ""King"" or ""Supreme Ruler"".  It is not part of our culture.  Our Constitution is set up to deter military coups because it guarantees opportunities for turnover in the executive and legislative branches.  Amending the Constitution is incredibly difficult.  We don't have tribal or religious divisions within our society.  The West outgrew that hundreds of years ago.   There's also the impeachment process.  It happened with Nixon who although was not formally impeachment it was all but guaranteed to occur within a day or so of his decision to resign.    A constitution ceases to exist the moment the military takes over the government.",JKlerk,2025-04-08T07:03:17,15
"In America, an officer will only have command of an organization for a short time, say 3 years, whereas enlisted people may stay longer on average, for say five years.  Because of this, people in the military don’t feel like their leader is their personal patron.  Officers do not amass the amount of personal power that officers in other countries do.  I served 16 years in the military.  If any of my COs had tried to overthrow the government, the people under their command would have helped to detain them.",IceNein,2025-04-08T09:27:06,16
"We are still suffering from the 1980 coup in Turkey.  Officially it was over in 2 years, their biggest hooks into the system to continue to exert influence were removed in the 90s, but they destroyed political and social movements, the continuity of democratic processes was permanently crippled, the floodgates to Islamization were thrown wide open from above.  The 1980 coup is one of the main reasons for today's situation. Caught between an anachronistic sense of national identity and xenophobic, fundamentalist and reactionary reflexes, all peppered with corruption.  Sad to see it mentioned here as a positive example.",Gezzaia,2025-04-08T10:16:41,10
"You think the US is at a place where a coup is needed or beneficial?   GET OFF REDDIT. No seriously, go outside.   When Trump does something illegal (or possibly so) courts continue to block or delay him. This is good.   When Trump does something that large percentages of Americans dislike, the citizens protest en masse. This is good.   If Trump orders the military do something unconstitutional or in violation of international norms, I have faith that military leaders will not follow those orders or make that direction down chain.   We don't need a coup in the US, you need appropriate levels of defiance. There is no single point of failure here, far, far, far from it.",mikeo2ii,2025-04-08T09:50:21,24
"I think a comparison of Trump (or any other president) to those circumstances represents a severe lack of contextual understanding of the history of those countries, the reality of Donald Trump, or both.    * The April Revolution in South Korea dealt with an actual despot following the end of active hostilities in the Korean War.   * The Pakistan situation was *very* complicated, and the resulting coup and hanging of the former PM has a lot of geopolitical nuances too detailed to go into here.  * The Turkish coup was the third in 20 years, if my memory serves, and resulted in military rule for a number of years.  It's somewhat strange to highlight this as a seemingly positive outcome.  The three you list have one thing in common in that they dealt with strong militaries and military figures.  United States military personnel, however, take an oath to the Constitution and not the president, and as bad as Trump is as a president and leader, there's nothing going on that would create an issue anywhere close to pressing where military intervention could be justified.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-08T07:33:59,15
"In part because the US military cycles its officers around so much. No one is in command long enough to form any kind of clique or cohesive group even if they wanted to.  Secondly, the US military has only in very recent times been a really respectable mass institution.  But from the times it was more ragtag and periphery to the present bureaucratic entity it is now, it has generally avoided politics. Groups in the military that chafed against this, be it the Navy after WW2 or Walker types in the 60s got clapped hard and a kind of aloof professionalism predominates. The political poppy that pops up gets cut. It’s to the point where social media can in theory can your entire career if you go too off a safe, relatively apolitical path.   Your average officer is just doing his time and maybe looking at a board position in a company if he’s high enough up the ladder. Politics are office politics not national politics.",DerCringeMeister,2025-04-08T09:33:19,3

"I'm turkish. If you think the 1980 coup brought peace to Turkey, I'm sorry but you just don't know what you're talking about. I'm not gonna go into too much detail but many of our current problems can be traced back to the coup. If you think the coup was purely to fix the country and has nothing to do with the cold war you're badly mistaken. There is not much of a problem about the politicians of the time, they continued to be political leaders in the following years. The rise of Turkish nationalism can be directly tied to the coup era politics. For the effects on human lives, you should first check the results section of the wikipedia page. Look into tortures people were exposed to and finally read about Diyarbakır Prison. There was a reason everyone was against the coup in 2015. No one in Turkey would advocate for a military coup. Be careful what you wish for.",redsketchbook,2025-04-08T13:57:03,3
"The US military is just built differently. You don’t want to hear the oath is sworn, but it is real. Not to a person or a party, or even to the government, but to the constitution. Not every nation does that.  Also, we teach our soldiers constitutional law relevant to service at the beginning, and we are an “obey at peril” military, where you cannot claim you were ordered to commit a crime and be ok, our troops are required to consider legality of every order, and ignore illegal orders.  Then we teach small unit leadership, where we have troops making decisions on their own based on battlefield conditions, as the officer or other leader on the ground has a better view of what is going on. So we tell them what needs to be done, and let them make some choices in how to do it.  So every soldier took the oath to the constitution, and where some troops might go along with a coup, the reality is that would be a tiny portion of the military.  So if Trump tried a coup to remain in power after his term ends, he would be arrested. If the sec def tried to overthrow the civilian government, he would be arrested.

"It's very important to keep in mind that the US's structure of government is VERY decentralized as compared to most other countries. Much of the routine day to day governance is handled by state governments that are not subject to direct political control from the national government, or by city or county governments that are subordinate to the states and not the national government.  This means that seizing the center actually gets you very little in the sense of direct control of the nation. Sure, you have control of the army, but you don't have a mechanism to put your loyalists in control of the things that really matter - food distribution, power distribution, transportation, media, etc. So consolidating after a coup would be incredibly difficult, and you have no real way to generate the appearance of legitimacy by purging your political opponents, except by physically rounding them up.  On top of that, the US is -big-. This means a lot of the military commands are physically isolated from each other, not through some kind of intentional separation to prevent coups, but simply because they're hundreds or even thousands of miles away. That limits the amount of conspiracy you can get up to, simply because you can't quickly move units without people noticing.",Avatar_exADV,2025-04-08T09:41:16,4

"Steel man:  A lot of those countries live under very real violent threats from their neighbors.  Military leaders may grow sick of the slow, weak, inefficient, bureaucratic, “popularity contest” civilian govt to effectively and honestly address those threats.  Military coups help nations address those threats to national security when the civilian govt proves incapable. Better to have a country under a military dictatorship which can deter existential threats than no country at all, right?",BettisBus,2025-04-08T09:55:23,1
"For most coups its due to outside funding or personal stability. If you revolt your paycheck gets revoked. Pretty simple, you do what the guy paying you says to do. The US also has other branches of police forces that would block the military. There are a number of pressure valves in the system to prevent a standard coup. The legislation can remove him, and the VP plus a majority of his cabinet can remove him.  Before it can get to a point where the military would get involved the idea is that the cabinet and other branches would jump in. There is a two year pressure of review in the voting system so it favors more stable ruling.  The current situation is extremely abnormal.",zayelion,2025-04-08T10:08:42,1

"Coups are generally bad, at least in the short term. The blow to stability has major downstream impacts  on things like the economy, destruction of infrastructure , etc.   America has had quite a few uprisings and rebellions , less so after the Civil War but early to early 20th century America was pretty unstable.  I think the reason we don't have coups or rebellions today is a mixture of quality of life, culture, and conditioning both civilian and military.  The US has never had a military class in the way some other, older and more traditional countries may have had. It's more of a profession than a core cultural demographic or tenent. Unlike in Turkey, for instance, where military service is social obligation, being in the US military while revered doesn't really come with any inherent social or political benefits for service members. I think that often the social obligation of military service, because it plays such a large part of everyone's lives,  gives the military a type of moral authority that just doesn't exist in the US. Military service in the US is considered brave, but for the most part it's seen as a professional path not unlike any other professional path. Voluntary service  Rather than mandated also plays a crucial part.  Quality of life is also a big factor. US soldiers are paid quite well, especially for the age group that most enlisted are a part of. It's harder to justify a coup to a group that are more afraid of losing the benefits they already have in search of theoretical benefits in the future than it would be for a group without much to lose. Quality of life also plays a factor in public support. Most Americans are more afraid of losing what they have. A coup is radical and could lead to extreme change which for most is just not worth it.   Culturally Americans have been conditioned (for better or worse) to believe that the military works as a subseverient arm of the democracy we live in. It's not it's own institution. Defying orders given by the president or even congress, which again we have conditioned ourselves to believe is a representative of the people, has always been looked down upon. There is also the fears of a dictatorship which tbh most military coups devolve into. Our culture doesn't really celebrate generals or military commanders. They're not held in especially high public esteem or believed to be a political or moral figure. Theyre simply meant to do a job. The higher rank means youve done your job well, not really much more. Sure a few have been presidents but I would challenge you to find more than a handful of Americans who could name our military leaders today, outside of the high profile civilian political figures. I say this to say the military doesn't have a public facing figure to rally behind or lead a coup and gain public support. Outside of the president. Hell I would be willing to bet most service members couldn't tell you who all of the military leaders are. Also US military is an enormous ""institution"" and US military culture prioritizes trust and companionship among smaller groups such as squad mates rather than the upper brass. I think the common saying is ""when in combat you fight for the people next to you"" or something like that.  It's just survival for you and those around you.   There is no greater cause or allegiance pushing people to fight. Obviously this changes during times of war, but someone attempting to lead a coup during a major war would likely be even more hard pressed to find support.",cprker13,2025-04-08T11:34:33,1

"One thing OP is not considering is the size of our military and our geographic size makes this a really hard thing to pull off, That one commander would need enough power and influence to command enough military assets to do this successfully, that is extremely unlikely due to structural, doctrine and ideological differences across federal, local and state governments. Even if a commander was willing to do such a thing it’s unlikely a large enough number of rhetorical rank in file would follow, and states could and would likely resist as well, is a coup or civil war possible in the US yes, chances of it happening without some major unifying black swan event is extremely unlikely.   Also as I mentioned the US is a massive country compared to those examples it would be a logistical nightmare to coordinate on a large scale.  How far will troops follow orders before resisting or rising up against the government who knows but it would be very hard to act at scale.  I don’t think Americans are conditioned to think coups are bad, I don’t think Americans can even truly process how to carry one out on a large scale as it would be a massive undertaking. On a small scale possible but would likely be over powered and put down quickly or break into ineffective in fighting.",Solo-Hobo,2025-04-08T14:52:18,1

"Honestly I think we're about to find out. Trump's first term showed that a sensible administration could at the very least restrain presidential authorities. With Covid being a unique case since it was an emergency scenario, most of the government continued running as per usual despite Presidential meddling. This administration is far different though. Trump has shown he has zero interest in working with anything other than yes men, and is hollowing the government to his liking.  With how awful the economy could become in the next year or two, and rising tensions as summer approaches and joblessness increases, things are going to become violent one way or another. And since Trump is solely responsible for this self inflicted misery right now, blame is squarely on him and his associates. This will either end in rebellions, like the Irish troubles, on the ground, or a coup from the top. Either way, this is literally only two months in and it feels like two years. This tariff was already considered the worst of the worst case scenarios, and Trump has passed that metric.

You need a dose of reality, my friend. The US leadership isn't ""destructive"", let alone destructive enough to need a coup. The structure is set up well enough that military leaders wouldn't overthrow the country even if they could, which they can't because more than half of the army would just refuse to follow the orders of a commander trying to coup the regime. And EVEN IF the coup somehow happened, the current regime won a democratic election. The people would revolt, and the country would be branded an ACTUAL military dictatorship.

">But that wasn’t even my question. But your response suggests to me that Americans have been conditioned to think that all coups are bad.   They are bad when you have better alternatives. The most obvious better alternatives in the US of ALWAYS to wait 2 years for another election. Until the US election system breaks down, a coup is definitely the worst option.   A coup might be good if you have a leader you have no other way to remove, but a coup is like an amputation without antibiotics. Yeah, it might be something that you do if you are desperate and have no choice, but you are an idiot to try one if you can just take a pill and make the problem go away.   If the US citizens are unhappy with Trump, in 1.5 years that can elect new Congress representatives to chop off Trump's balls. In 3.5 years, that can remove him entirely. Congress can even impeach him before that if they really want to.   On the other hand, a coup right now in the US would definitely kick off a civil war, and even in the absolute best case scenario you'd be picking up the pieces for years or decades.   No, the obvious solution is just to use elections. As long as elections work, it's the most painless and safe way to remove an idiot.    No system selected good leaders, and some (like the ones that use coups) select for bloody minded psychos that climb over the corpses of their enemies to get into power. Democracies are barely any better at selecting leaders than any other system. The great advantage of a functional democracy isn't leadership selection; it's leadership removal. You can show an idiot the foot without having to plunge the nation into civil war and hope the bloody minded psycho holding the gun is actually a super cool guy.",Rindan,2025-04-08T10:37:19,19

"America has indeed been conditioned to believe all coups are bad. We mostly think about Latin American dictatorships and the mass purges that followed. Nevermind that those coups were often manufactured by outside forces, rather than through organic means.  There's also this culture of ""peaceful protests"" that has become mainstream in American consciousness. We're taught that leaders like Martin Luther king was successful due to his peaceful approach and strong dialogue, while never teaching about the violent riots that also occurred around his time.  This has a lot to do with being young, isolationist, and spoilishly wealthy across generations. There's just not a lot from our own history to draw guidance from. So we look to other countries and only see the failures rather than the successes of coups. Compared to Europe, Iran, and other asian nations, that have often had points in history where coups ended up benefitting the regular people.",illegalmorality,2025-04-08T19:22:21,1

"Fun questions! I am not sure I'm qualified to answer all that, but I do know the answer to some of it.  Everything in the solar system pulls on the earth, at least a little, so yes it could. But it would have to be pretty damn big. We're worried about asteroids a few miles across sometimes, but it would have to be small-moon sized to really affect our planet, I think. And if it was already in our solar system, we'd almost definitely have seen it. And if not, the solar system is HUGE. We would have some time.   Speed isn't really a factor in terms of influence on the planet though. Faster would probably be better in a near-miss scenario, because it would have less time to influence the planet. It might give just a little extra kick to the earth if it was moving at just the right angle and speed, but really it is probably pretty negligible. But if it was big enough, it wouldn't matter. Another jupiter coming into the solar system would affect the orbit of pretty much everything.   So how far it had to be moved would be entirely dependent on its mass.  Speed is really the scariest factor though. A basketball sized object moving at like 40% the speed of light could probably blow up the moon. And could happen before we knew what happened. We don't know if that happens, but it seems likely.   There's a pretty cool book about something like that, actually. Seveneves by Neil Stephenson starts with the moon exploding from... Something.

You don't do a civil war to prevent a dictator, you do a civil war in response to a dictator.

Further, even if you totally disagree with that statement, that doesn't change the fact that everyone else disagrees with you. A significant portion of the population is not going to take up arms to overthrow the government until they see that elections don't work anymore. Elections still work. As long as elections still work, it's easier to check a different box then take up arms against the government.   That's the whole point of a democracy.
