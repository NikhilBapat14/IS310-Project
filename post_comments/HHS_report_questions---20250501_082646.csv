"400 pages of lies, citing the likes of the NYT and Cass, to lay the groundwork to justify banning trans healthcare for youth first and then certainly for adults. Any news org that gives this report credence is complicit in the eradication of trans people in the US. This will only harm us. If you're cis you need to speak out against this at every opportunity or you too are complicit.",witchgrove,2025-05-01T08:46:18,13
This affects more than just trans youth. This is a concerted attack on all trans healthcare.,AdrenochromeDream,2025-05-01T10:29:56,8
"They were ordered to recreate the circus that was the Cass Report here in the US. It’s all bread and circus to distract you from how hard you will be struggling with the coming shortages.  The Cass Report was debunked as pseudoscience, and as grifter pseudoscience goes- what America creates from this will inevitably be debunked by actual scientists and actual science eventually, given those scientists are willing to be crushed by the admin for sharing findings that disagree with the admin’s feelings.  What matters is how they’ve already planned to use the predetermined outcome of the US’ version of the Cass Report given that the animus aligned control the purse in addition to all forms of government.   They’ve already declared that trans people do not exist- now they need to actually make them not exist. This is the beginning of that process. In tandem to this, they are destroying therapy and suicide prevention services for those same people.  This regime believes that you will be grateful for these actions having been done towards this group of people, with no expense spared using your tax dollars in pursuit of erasing this population, in spite of your empty bellies, empty shelves, and empty Christmas trees.",[deleted],2025-05-01T08:35:36,11
"Of course it's based largely on thr Cass Review. That was set up for a predetermined outcome by people in the DeSantis administration. They've been engineering these debunked studies and reports for years, ignoring all the doctors and evidence that prove the flaws in their evidence, all just to ban gender affirming care and remove trans people from public life.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-05-01T08:37:25,12
"I encourage all of you to give this link a read.   On its face, this “questioning” by the HHS (as directed by the Trump administration) might seem fair, but many of the findings here fly directly in the face of near-universal medical consensus. Gender-affirming care saves lives. Legislation against it takes them.",Ardielley,2025-05-01T08:27:37,12
There are *forty* years of research that support gender affirming care for minors.,KulaanDoDinok,2025-05-01T08:30:49,17
The people behind this report are evil. There’s no other way to describe those who are actively attempting to strip away lifesaving healthcare from children.,NaivePhilosopher,2025-05-01T08:34:44,11
AI was definitely used in this “report”. It literally lists a 404 page in the bibliography.,Angmar404,2025-05-01T11:14:44,3
"No evidence cited, no doctor or scientist of any kind associated with the review. At least the Cass review attempted to pass itself as legitimate science. This is incredibly lazy",3nderslime,2025-05-02T19:47:47,2
I’d be interested in seeing the unreleased WPATH-commissioned SRs from Johns Hopkins University and examine how they compare/contrast with the University of York SR that informed the Cass Review on the current strength of the evidence.,primesah89,2025-05-01T14:15:44,0
"Referring to when DeSantis ordered a similar report to be created with a predetermined pseudoscientific outcome, and when his HHS department refused because they were scientists being commanded to be anti-science, they were all fired and replaced with loyal stooges who produced the report with the desired outcome within a month’s time?   And this is the same DeSantis who then used that outcome he demanded as justification for restricting access to healthcare for both trans minors and adults, restricting public access for trans minors and adults, and restricting education for trans minors and adults?  The same DeSantis who put it into Florida law that providing gender affirming care for minors in any capacity, even when just talk therapy was involved, was grounds in child custody cases for children to be taken away from their parents by the state?",[deleted],2025-05-01T08:46:56,12
"> Gender-affirming care saves lives. Legislation against it takes them.  Tracks. They don't want trans people to exist, after all.",schwanzweissfoto,2025-05-01T09:12:19,6
"Exactly. And this administration has the gall to try to invalidate all of it. It’s pure callousness, bigotry, and willful ignorance. No dice.",Ardielley,2025-05-01T08:33:04,10
"Indeed. No benefit of the doubt anymore. If you’re claiming to do the right thing while at the same time acting against the rights and dissent of those impacted by your decisions, all while actively disregarding all the evidence out there… I can only conclude the same thing you have.",Ardielley,2025-05-01T08:43:24,5
