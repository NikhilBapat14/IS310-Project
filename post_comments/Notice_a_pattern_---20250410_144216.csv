"Not even sure if they were fired because they are 'DEI' or because they were just too qualified to pull this ridiculous stuff off with them around. A little column A, a little column B I suppose.",Zealousideal-Day-298,2025-04-10T14:49:26,184

"EUCOM Supreme Allied Commander, Gen Christopher G. Cavoli is a white male and was also fired.    US Cyber Commander, Gen Timothy D Haugh is a white male and was also fired.   (I don't know all the ousted personnel, there could be more.)

However, regardless if a pattern does exist or not, I would rather look at the entire sample size for better clarity, instead of cherry picking for the sake of making a post.",Arno_92,2025-04-11T10:32:29,-1
