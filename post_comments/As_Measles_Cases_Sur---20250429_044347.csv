A high-profile outbreak of a once-eliminated child-killing disease right when RFK's in charge is probably the safest collective offramp from this lunacy. I'm just so mad at the other side for making things so bad that a bunch of kids have to be sacrificed to drag us back to sanity.",Sminahin,2025-04-29T09:19:07,2
