"The money that is absolutely pouring out of these slush funds is like an unattended firehose. Amazing. I can't imagine the corruption and wink-wink under-the-table deals that routinely happen. These ppl must have been taught by the best, all those completely ethical and above board politicians from Chicago.",37-19,2025-04-13T20:47:42,11

"MEDC executive committee members are appointed by Gretchen Whitmer, the idiot MI gov who auditioned as a member of the female Blue Man Group by face-hiding inside the oval office. She was also known for feeding a leftist podcaster Doritos to mock the Eucharist.  While the purpose of the organization is to create jobs, they haven't created a single one since 2021.  The squanderous use of those funds shouldn't be a surprise when you take a peek at those appointed member's backgrounds:  - Academics - 'A fierce advocate for Black people and people of color' - Implementation of Alternative Fuel Vehicles - active leadership role for racial equity, diversity and inclusion - began her career in Washington, DC in the nonprofit sector - National Labor Relations Board - previously Director of Public Affairs in the Whitmer Administration - Chief Deputy Attorney General in Michigan - member of the Urban Core Mayors Association",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-13T19:45:53,8
