"It is so very disturbing to me that ANY American - including those elected to public office - can be anything but horrified by what this administration is doing. But the magahats just double down and, for them, this is now the new normal, proper and acceptable. How does this get fixed?",impersonaljoemama,2025-04-12T09:52:37,87
I'm afraid that man is dead.  That's why they haven't brought him back.  They can't.,Bender_2024,2025-04-12T12:12:00,69
These people are traitors.  Time to treat them as such.,ComfortableWage,2025-04-12T12:54:45,26
Why not have Kristy Noem bring him back. She's down there a lot.,baby_budda,2025-04-12T20:22:15,13
There’s no way he’s not dead. I also highly doubt it was an accident. VERY weird coincidence that he’s escaped El Salvador and got sent back for a bulls hat… seems incredibly suspicious. They also can’t tell us any information about him and have no way to bring him back??? Seems very Russian.,Material_Delivery_91,2025-04-12T14:40:10,22

"The answer is PRECEDENT  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent  The process used to determine who and how an individual was selected and removed has not been disclosed which is truly frightening.   However I did read that somehow tattoos are assigned ""points"" and a determination of gang affilliation is being assigned by a points system.   Makes you wonder what the criteria really is if they're not looking at criminal records.  Due Process has not been applied.  Equally so, no one has been returned.  The FIRST TIME something shifts this process by judicial review and order, sets PRECEDENT. This then means anyone else can ALSO cite this instance as the reason they too should be allowed the same, equal treatment. In this case, returning the individual to the US.  If you don't let ANYONE out, there is no PRECEDENT.  They are working hard to make sure that no one will, even if they screwed up.",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-13T07:03:15,5
