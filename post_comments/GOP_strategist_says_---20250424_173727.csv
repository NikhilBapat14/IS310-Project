It’s unfathomable to me how a government which ignores and actively mocks the rule of law and the legal rulings of the nation’s highest courts can hold itself out as tough on crime. How can they hold themselves out as protecting people from lawbreakers and illegal activities when they themselves are lawbreakers and actively engage in illegal activities. They are literally the lawbreakers they claim to be protecting the citizens from.,Newleafto,2025-04-24T17:43:51,31

"pretty fucking over “white men” being thrown under the bus constantly. Number 1, PLENTY of white male democrats. But also, I’m pretty sure if I were to make broad characterizations about another race, no matter how true, I’d be banned.   I totally get stereotyping other groups makes people feel shitty, why does asking for the same treatment open me to ridicule?",Pseudoburbia,2025-04-25T03:18:27,1

"I think we have to prepare for that eventuality. His presidency has thus far been unprecedented for a functioning democracy and, alarmingly, rather typical for a dictatorship going through the initial steps of overthrowing a democracy. First they replace all the generals and key government officials with incompetent sycophantic loyalists (check), then they cow the media by attempting to discredit them (check), then they cow the opposition rendering them ineffective (the democrats basically checked themselves), then they refuse to obey the courts and try to replace (or remove) judges (work in progress). There are more steps (jailing journalists and politicians etc), but there is a pattern of behaviour here which should be ringing alarm bells.",Newleafto,2025-04-24T18:52:25,1
"Its setup to benefit RICH people, including white men would mean that I as a non rich white male would also benefit. Nothing about what they’re doing is benefitting me, so I fail to see how the favor is being extended to anyone but the wealthy. ",Pseudoburbia,2025-04-25T11:12:22,1
"You are right it primarily benefits rich people. But it is also set up to punish minorities and women, and that's what  you get the benefit of avoiding as a white man. You are not currently at risk for getting deported to El Salvador for example.",bryan49,2025-04-25T11:21:14,1
"Black and Asian men aren’t being targeted either, the more encompassing categorization would be birth citizens are being favored over all others…. for now anyways. But it’s not singling out white men.",Pseudoburbia,2025-04-25T16:26:13,1
