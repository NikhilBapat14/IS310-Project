"Journalism has become the subtle art of dropping Trump's name and stuff into every damned thing to fuel clicks, if you look up an article about fishing from the past few weeks it will still mention tariffs because reasons.  Trump is exploiting the fact that Beijing's position is not as strong as they say. PRChina has been lying about its strength *every single day Reddit has existed,* magic missile this infinite troop landing capacity that and America-free world order the other - **hour after hour day after day** ***decade after decade.***  Maybe they could have paid their workers if they didn't fund a shitting campaign to dwarf America Online's free disk nonsense.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-04T17:42:57,83

"This is what Obama meant when he said that the Constitution was a document of ""negative liberties"". He hated that the Constitution handcuffed him from doing the things that really wanted to do as president. He also went on the say that he admired CCP Chairman Hu Jintao because he didn't have a Constitution limiting his power.",Wing_attack_Plan_R,2025-05-05T09:13:03,4
