"Trump was crowing about the stock market highs during Biden's admin claiming they were only that high because the market expected him to win.  Now that he's won and the stock market has crashed, it is Biden's fault?  I wish we lived in a world where pointing out right wing hypocrisy did anything. Unfortunately, they are shameless to a shocking degree, though alway ready to point out the slightest dem hypocrisy.",travio,2025-05-01T12:54:35,69

I think the better question is why Biden is letting Trump destroy the economy and everything else. We must vote in more Republicans so Biden can't do this to Trump anymore.  /s,markroth69,2025-05-01T12:53:08,30

">Trump ~~tries to pin economic woes on Biden,~~  lies some more, using his obsession with Biden as his whipping boy, while everyone else points to tariffs",monkeywithgun,2025-05-01T12:53:07,2
It’s still hard to believe the simple fact that this is all self-imposed by MAGA idiots. Everything that’s happening right now wasn’t the result of some foreign adversary destroying the country. They did this all to us by electing the dumbest motherfucker to ever rule a nation.,DraganTaveley,2025-05-01T13:03:28,2
"But all the Cons on reddit insisted that trump was actually president last term while the DNC carted Waymo-Biden around the country, or something to that effect. So it can't possibly be Biden's fault.",LW_GLAZER,2025-05-01T13:50:52,2

"A malignant narcissist is mentally incapable of accepting that they failed.  Having an insulating ring of sycophants isn't by accident. He wants people that tell him his awful ideas are terrific as long as they get a piece of the pie.  To Trump and his cult, he can only be failed. He cannot fail.",EndangeredDemocracy,2025-05-01T15:05:01,1
"The part I don’t understand about tariffs is that if you place tariffs on all the parts that you use to manufacture things in the US, how can you sell those things outside the US?    They simply won’t be competitive on price with goods that are manufactured in a non tariff country with parts that are far cheaper.   Because the US is not all of the market for manufactured goods, it’s only a decent fraction of it.",BannedForEternity42,2025-05-01T16:06:14,1

That sad thing is he may be right kinda. We haven't even seen the full effects of the tariffs. It hasn't hit Brock and mortar stores yet. Just wait a few weeks,cubicles-suck,2025-05-01T18:04:32,1

"Don't get it mixed. They voted him back in because Dems and Libruhls bad, and Trump said they could fuck around and not find out (which, big surprise, is turning out to be a lie, they're finding out).
