"Stupid fucking toddlers not hiring competent representation. According to Google, by age 2, most toddlers can use two-word phrases. Should have learned ""lawyer now.""   In all seriousness what the fuck is going on? I was reading about this earlier and ICE let the mother and father talk for a literal minute. Then deported the child and mother. The child being a US Citizen.   They want to juice the numbers for Dear Leader so they don't give a fuck who they deport (including their fellow citizens).",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-26T13:44:51,28

A mother still breast-feeding her young child was deported to Cuba on Thursday. The Mother was detained at her check-in appointment with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The child was with the Mother during the appointment and ripped from her Mother’s arms. The child remains in U.S. with the Father.  https://archive.ph/2025.04.26-235812/https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article305077166.html,coffeequeen0523,2025-04-27T00:34:02,3

"Not to mention we're spending a small fortune for each deportation, from what I'm reading.   Of course money takes a back seat to humanity but money the GOP's big talking point.",anndrago,2025-04-26T14:24:09,8
"I can bet you on the paperwork they deported the mother and not the child. If the child voluntarily leaves with the parent (for example, to keep the family together), it’s considered a voluntary departure of the U.S. citizen child, not a deportation. That’s probably how they got around deporting her, because ICE cannot “deport” a U.S. citizen child — legally, a U.S. citizen cannot be deported.",EliteUnited,2025-04-27T01:19:26,0
"From the article:  >""The Government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,"" Doughty wrote. ""But the Court doesn't *know* that.""  That's what it means that there wasn't a meaningful process. The government is saying it's so without it having gone through the legal process to verity.  It also talks about how the husband barely got to talk to his wife and then it was only for a few minutes. He's still in the US, so the child is going to be separated from one of her parents either way. Wouldn't it be nice if they had time to make a decision of this magnitude and then affirm that in a court of law so it couldn't be questioned?",Gertrude_D,2025-04-26T23:59:22,2
"And not to mention _further_ that the administration is spending millions kicking people out of the country who want to be here, then turning around and begging women to have kids because the birth rate is declining.",mike_pants,2025-04-26T16:38:00,6
"Amazed at using the word ""deport"" is the cause for concern and not the lack of due process or anything else with this story. Holy fuck.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-27T01:45:39,1
