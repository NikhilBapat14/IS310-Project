"Amazon threatens to include tariff pricing on orders on their website, Trump claims to have convinced them not to, Amazon decides to hide the tariff cost in the price of the item, days later there’s a push for Amazon to take over the USPS?

Should be fun when Amazon stops delivering to that last leg that countless folks survive on because companies deem it too expensive to ship there.    USPS takes it over but now? Fuck the rural voters according to Trump.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T19:40:13,11
"Am I reading this wrong or is there not a shred of actual evidence in this article demonstrating the intent of Amazon to acquire the postal service? Just talks about expanding its own delivery network, not taking over the mail.",lucky-struck,2025-05-06T22:06:31,5

"I have no fundamental problem with privatizing mail delivery. It's a service that private industry can easily supply, especially if the government were to create a common-carrier style framework where private carriers would be required to interface with each other and transfer parcels carrier to carrier with each receiving a pre-set share of the revenue. That way, the system could be operated by many competing firms that could each win contracts by being the lowest bidder, delivering a high quality service at the lowest possible prices for consumers. People in rural areas that have higher delivery costs, they might pay slightly higher rates than people in suburban and urban areas, but they would pay the lowest commercially viable rate for that service, and they save a lot of money on housing and food by living in the rural area in the first place.  But you know that's not how our government would do it, democrat or republican. There's no way they don't hand the whole or huge portions of the work to a single oligarch, creating a massive barrier to entry for possible competitors, leading to high prices in the long run when the operator claims they ""have no choice but to raise prices"", but there's no competitor out there to offer a better deal anyway. There's no way they don't subsidize the mail to rural areas using revenue from the denser areas.",Chi_SocialMedia_Jobs,2025-05-07T10:13:19,1
No way Amazon is not obligated to keep all of their delivery drivers.,TopSky3186,2025-05-07T11:42:31,1
"The entire purpose of the tariffs was to force major retailers and importers to make back door deals with Trump.  Trump may have 200 deals in progress, but they are not deals with countries - they are deals with corporations.  It is not other countries that pay import taxes (AKA:  tariffs) - it is corporations that pay import taxes.  Those trying to understand the tariffs as economic policy are dangerously naive.  Simply put the tariffs are a means to compel loyalty from every business that will need to petition Trump for relief.  Economists and political pundits can not explain how the tariffs make economic sense - because they don't make economic sense.  They are not designed as economic policy.  The tariffs are designed as a new, super dangerous political tool.  The founders of our country created a President with limited and checked powers.  they specifically put the power of spending and taxation in the hands of the Congress, because they had seen how Kings and Despots used spending and taxes to control their subjects.  British kings used taxation to reward loyalty and punish dissent.  Our revolution was spurred by the King's use of heavy taxation of the Colonies to punish our push for self-governance.  The King's message was clear:  stop protesting and I will stop taxing.  Trump knows he can weaken (and maybe destroy) democracy by spending and taxation in the same way.  He is using access to government funds to bully universities, law firms, and State and Local governments into loyalty pledges.  Healthy democracies rely on an independent legal profession to maintain the rule of law, independent universities to guard objective truth and provide forums for dissent to authority, and independent State and Local governments to counterbalance a powerful Federal government - but the private sector also plays a role to protect democracy.  Independent industry has power.  The tariffs are Trump's way of eroding the independence of the private sector.  Now, one by one, every industry or company will need to pledge loyalty to Trump to get the sanctions relief they need to stay in business.  What will Trump demand as part of these loyalty pledges?  Public shows of support for all his policies.  Contributions to his political efforts.  Promises to police their employees to ensure that they support Trump and that none dare oppose Trump in any way.  Trump did not invent this strategy.  It is the playbook for destroying democracy, for those who get elected and want to ensure that they can never be voted out, those who want to remain 'President for life'.  This is how a democracy becomes a dictatorship.  Trump is consolidating his power and the time remaining to stop him is growing short.  Public mobilization is working.  We only need to convince a few Republicans in Congress to join the Democrats to revoke Trump's tariff taxes.  The people still have the power - if we work quickly.  When fascists are consolidating their power and dismantling our democracy, you have to find out if you will accept the situation you're in. Either let that become the new normal, or do something. And with that risk everything.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-06T19:25:48,118

"I’m not even sure if we can count on the courts anymore though…  Trump is replacing high government officials with loyalists. People under protected legal status are being deported back to El Salvador and thrown in their prisons without any real trial or due process, and the Trump administration is getting away with it by labelling it an “accident”. The courts aren’t doing anything about it because even they’re beginning to fear him.   I’m not saying our country will collapse anytime soon, but it’s really starting to get concerning because democracy is just straight up failing in some areas and it’s getting worse.   It honestly sickens me what he’s doing to people who live in this country who have families and loved ones.",SubjectTourist4965,2025-05-06T19:45:22,6
"The Citizens United decision has made it virtually impossible to win without having the backing of at least a portion of the super-rich.  This has caused many Democrats to be reluctant to vote against the interests of the super-rich.  Small wonder we are now left with a choice between a political party that is largely beholden to the super-rich, and another that is backing fascism.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-06T19:21:07,21
"What evidence would one expect to see from a company that was considering competing to take over the role of the Post Office?  Cozying up to the President and building up their own delivery capabilities - those are two indications of the intent to compete for this prize plum.  As the article said:  ""Amazon May Be Preparing to Take Over"".  The key word there is 'May'.  Clearly this is speculation - and there was no statement that it was known to be a certainty.  As this privatization of the Post Office is a major development, I don't see anything wrong with speculating about who the competitors will be to take over this highly lucrative service, when (and if) it becomes privatized.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-05-07T00:57:50,1

" The first step to change for the better is to stop falling for propaganda calling things you don't like communism or socialism and instead call them by their correct term.  In this case the correct term is ""dystopian capitalist hellscape"".  Communism is quite literally the opposite of privately owned. And what every Middle class or lower class person should want is socialism...where workers own the means of production and are rewarded their fair share for their work, rather than having the means of production owned by the capital class (capitalism).  Maybe if more people figured this out, we could actually get some change here. You will never get ahead in capitalism, because it's not designed for you to benefit. It's designed for you to be a wage slave for the capital class",xicor,2025-05-07T06:32:05,0
