"Jesus man, leave people alone. It’s not tough to continually attack a vulnerable community. Do you have any idea how weak you look? These are kids that attended and graduated high school in these states and are looking to better themselves and become productive members of society. They will do more for their communities and this country than you ever will.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T17:35:01,10
"Undocumented students in Colorado have gone on to be teachers, nurses, and business owners thanks to a program that allows them to pay in-state tuition at public universities.  Now the future of that program and ones like it in 23 other states are in doubt after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that seeks to punish states and cities with so-called sanctuary policies.  The order, signed on April 28, also specifically calls out programs that provide in-state tuition for undocumented students who graduated from high school in that state or who meet other residency requirements.",chalkbeat,2025-05-06T17:26:06,5

Nurse shortage is getting worse by me. Paired with the fact that most private hospitals are merging with each other to make the care worse but profits higher.   GF is a nurse and she's getting a masters to GTFO and go elsewhere.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T17:29:29,5
