"(Apologies, this will be long but we need to discuss with some common understanding.)  The basis of the strength of US treasury holdings (largely T-bills as the core financial instrument), as well as the US dollar being the global reserve currency, is TRUST.  The premise of this TRUST is that the US, as the lynchpin of the current global economy, is reliable, predictable, and does not (at least overtly), allow blatant political and / or nationalistic manipulation nor considerations.  This is why the chairperson of the US Federal Reserve is independent upon appointment and unless they resign / die in office, cannot be legally replaced during the tenure of their appointment.  This is why the world‚Äôs markets and central bankers went wonky a couple of weeks ago when Trump started publicly rambling about firing / removing the current Chair ‚Ä¶.  Even though the US suspended the pegging of the USD to the gold standard in 1971 and the globe shifted to a floating exchange rate, some key pillars of the Bretton Woods system have largely endured since (in large measure due to the IMF, World Bank, and presidents not screwing around with the Chair of the US Fed Reserve).  And the US has continued to reap the benefits of being the economic lynchpin for the globe, both with its T-bills as well as having the global reserve currency.  All of the above goes back to the key basis for US T-bills being reliable and predictable, as well as the USD being the global reserve currency:  TRUST.   Fascist America under Trump has become the very antithesis of what it was and has been economically for over 80 years, since Bretton Woods established the global economy:  it has become unreliable, unpredictable, blatantly manipulative, corrupt, odious and feckless.  Probably also incompetent, although that seems to be an unintended consequence vice an intent.  So, regardless of how much people decry the pain of liquidating US T-bills and moving away from the USD as the global reserve currency, the damage has already been done, the critical basis of TRUST is gone, and the world has no real choice.  No nation can beggar its economic survival.  We can collectively try to limp the brain dead patient along, but only insomuch as necessary to hopefully establish something different. Actions speak louder than words and fascist America has proven itself to by wholly UNTRUSTWORTHY.  Reap your whirlwind, America.",Spanky3703,2025-05-04T01:22:59,14

"Pretty simple stuff.   If the US no longer wants to trade in good faith, then there's no reason for other countries to finance their debt through treasury bonds.  Issue is that collapsing the dollar as the global reserve currency will also have severe consequences for the rest of the world.   I quite frankly can't put into perspective what kind of damage this would cause for all of us but maybe it's time to humble the US a little bit and teach them a lesson.",Excitium,2025-05-04T02:24:35,3

"üëçüèªüôèüèª    I think that western liberal democracies necessarily have ‚Äúloyal oppositions‚Äù that are self-serving in the pursuit of forming the next government.  But the issue for me is that pursuit being coupled with a conservative / populist mindset that drifts towards Trumpism / far-right tendencies.  All western liberal democracies have this nihilistic constituency and so far, when elections do occur, they are thankfully being held or even defeated.  When a national or even regional political party willfully forgets its first loyalty being to the nation and its citizens, that is when we see the issues that we are seeing around the world right now.  As Edmund Burke said, ‚ÄúThe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.‚Äù  And that is what authoritarianism and fascism and oligarchy thrive / rely on and exploit:  corruption, complacency and ‚Äúflooding the zone‚Äù (overwhelming people).    I enjoy discussing and debating, as I learn so much from smart people; ‚ÄúExcitium‚Äù is one of those smart people and I learn every day.  It is awesome.  I recollect Jean Chretien going ‚Äúviral‚Äù on the news across a lot of the western world about this event;  it was awesome and hilarious.  I do wonder what happened to his bodyguards post-fact, although his grip and execution suggest that he knew exactly what he was doing.  I love that PM Carney played hockey up to and including US Collegiate levels.  That his CV demonstrates excellence in both the public and private sectors.  That he is not a career politician and that he was educated at both Harvard and Oxford.  And finally:  -he has hit the grounding at a sprint;  -has already done some big block moves (cabinet coming soon, the King to open the next Parliament, has refused to play party politics with the opposition leader‚Äôs seat requirement, etc.); and  -that he has been clear and transparent regarding the challenges that Canada faces in pivoting away from the US, whilst at the same time making clear why Canada needs to do so and how he envisions that pivot being effected.  The premise to effective and functioning societies is societal trust.  Trump and his cabal have purposefully attacked that core in order to create the conditions necessary for what they want to do with the US:  shift it to an authoritarian system of government and economics that they can exploit and benefit from.  As citizens of liberal democratic countries, we cannot and (hopefully) will not let that stand, insomuch as it impacts our respective countries.   Thank you for the chats and we will undoubtedly chat again in the future.  Engaged, determined and moral people tend to work towards the same goals.

"While Japan‚Äôs sale of U.S. Treasuries could lead to short-term market fluctuations, the long-term effects may be limited: 	‚Ä¢	Interest Rates: A significant sell-off could temporarily increase U.S. interest rates. However, the Federal Reserve has tools to manage such fluctuations, including adjusting monetary policy to stabilize the economy. 	‚Ä¢	Currency Value: Selling U.S. debt might lead to a depreciation of the dollar. While this could make imports more expensive, it would also make U.S. exports more competitive globally. 	‚Ä¢	Market Confidence: A sudden move by Japan could unsettle financial markets in the short term. Nonetheless, the depth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets typically absorb such shocks over time.  Strategic Considerations for Japan  Using U.S. Treasury holdings as a bargaining chip carries risks for Japan: Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Currency Appreciation: Selling U.S. assets could strengthen the yen, potentially harming Japan‚Äôs export-driven economy by making its goods more expensive abroad. 	‚Ä¢	Economic Stability: A rapid divestment could disrupt global financial markets, which may, in turn, negatively impact Japan‚Äôs own economic interests.",CurrencyUser,2025-05-04T04:48:29,0

"Issue is that we don't really have a replacement for the dollar so we might be stuck with it regardless of what's going on in the US.   China doesn't want that responsibility since they don't quite want to shift to a consumer economy yet, although they are actively working towards that by slowly shifting manufacturing to places like Vietnam, Taiwan and India.  So the only other major currency left would be the Euro. But I don't really see us wanting that either since there's too little ambition within the union. I think most countries here are content just kinda trucking along and letting others lead the way.

"Was it extortion when the president threatened huge tariffs on historic partners without first going to these nations to discuss it first? I mean, trump could have opened trade talks with Japan diplomatically and informed that that we would be places tariffs on them unless they meet our strategic goals, but he didn‚Äôt, he a made a TV spectacle to the world. Publicly making that message signals that we are not partners, we are adversaries.

"If Japan needs funds to support its manufacturing sector against tariffs then increasingly shaky US Treasury bonds appear to be the best option.   As the US appears to be increasing the danger of sovereign default it may become the best option to pull out now while there is some value left.  China also possesses enormous bond holdings and has been withdrawing during this insane tariff war and selling gold reserves as it ramps up stimulus / support spending for its manufacturing sector.  Should both increase the bond yields and crash the USD then this will likely start a run on bonds by other nations and major investors.  I suspect that most governments are aware of the fact of an overdue cyclic economic recession with its onset being accelerated by Trump's brainless tariff war and his ignorance of macroeconomics.  If so, then many will not want to be caught holding the baby and will want to reduce exposure to an increasingly fragile US economy and its decline into a dysfunctional failed state.   Germany is considering removal of its gold reserves from the Federal Reserve for this reason. Attacks on the rule of law and economic decline has it worried that Trump will appropriate its gold reserves for his own purposes.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T21:11:47,12

"I completely agree with your assessment, you nailed it.  It is near-impossible to unwind an all-encompassing financial system that has developed and become entrenched over the past 80 plus years.  Everything from common economic language to financial systems to the trust-based underpinnings.  Doubly so with there being no viable nor readily available alternatives.  But the current system cannot be a mutually-assured destruction equation, either.   Trump has made a career of pushing anything and everything to the breaking point for personal advantage and gain.  This is another example of the same.

"Unfortunately I only see two options here.   Either a complete and total collapse of the global economy since neither Trump nor his admin seem to know what they even want to achieve with their trade war and Trump is too much of a narcissist to back down completely.  Japan came to negotiate and asked what the US's demands were and they couldn't name anything, so Japan left again without a deal or plans for further negotiations.  Trump says it's to bring back manufacturing but then flip flops daily with pauses, exemptions, higher tariffs here, lower tariffs there. No company is gonna start major operations with uncertainty like this. Not to mention that there's no plan to train the existing work force for factory work whatsoever. Even if you could build the factories over night, training people to work with the speed and precision that the Chinese work force can would take decades.  Then Trump says the tariffs are a negotiation tool to get better deals, his admin however says they are not.  Then Trump says the tariffs will replace the income tax but if you bring manufacturing back, as was the plan initially, and everything is manufactured domestically and nothing is imported, then the tariffs won't bring in any more money and the federal government goes bankrupt.  There's no coherent plan or vision here and no one seems to know what exactly is going. As you said, there's zero trust and only chaos.  Or the other option is US politicians finally growing a spine and impeaching his ass for real this time, or at the very least taking back authority over the tariffs since congress would usually impose tariffs and not the president.   I guess we'll see next month when US shelves start emptying, prices going up, people losing their jobs and companies going out of business what path we'll find us on.",Excitium,2025-05-04T03:06:24,3

"Thank you.  I really appreciate your rational and thoughtful responses;  they summarize and encapsulate a lot of parallel issues in well-written posts.  I totally agree with the fundamental incoherency and unpredictability that seems to be demonstrably at the core of the current American regime‚Äôs modus operandi.  The problem is that of the two potential outcomes that you posit (and not that I disagree with, by the way), one is unlikely to occur (the US political system re-asserting its ‚Äúchecks-and-balances‚Äù responsibilities on the president), at least based on their performance to this point.  And the other would most likely devolve the world to the point that economic collapse would be the least of our concerns.  A third potential outcome could be that Trump and his cabal pull back just enough to limp the extant system along on life support.  But the problem with that possible option is that the underpinning sense of trust is still gone and I cannot envision any circumstance where the rest of the world trusts America again, at least to any extent necessary to return to even a facsimile of normalcy.

"Ayup, completely understand and agree.  Canada has no real viable option other than to shift away from an 80% plus economic trade dependency with the US.  When your primary trading partner, closest neighbour, and most enduring ally goes rogue, seemingly without recourse, you reorient and resolve that strategic vulnerability.  The intervening period of transition will be challenging and difficult for Canada (and for the US, although they are too willfully ignorant at present to grasp that onrushing tsunami and the resultant economic pain that it will bring for the US economy, but that is a lesson best left to unfold of its own accord).  I am honestly confident that Canada has the political, economic, social and cultural sinews and leadership (both public and private sectors), to reorient itself.
