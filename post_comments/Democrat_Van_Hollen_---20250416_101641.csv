"Nothing like a taxpayer funded trip to El Salvador to visit someone who was found by an American judge to have credible evidence of vicious terrorist group affiliation.   This is what they do. They cry over the wrong people. Meanwhile you could barely get them to say the names of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray, or Austin Metcalf.   I know they’re scared of what a strong and secure America that finds her national identity looks like but at some point they have to be held accountable for this hypocrisy and immorality.",slagathor_zimblebob,2025-04-16T11:23:18,39
