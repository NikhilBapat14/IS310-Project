"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday speech that the ongoing tariffs showdown against China is unsustainable and he expects a ""de-escalation"" in the trade war between the world's two largest economies. ,~ AP News  Jamie Dimon of Jp Morgan Chase said that sliding into recession was “a likely outcome” for the U.S. if the president did not row back his aggressive reciprocal tariffs program. He insisted that America could surrender its economic preeminence on the world stage if Trump persists with his efforts to remould global trade more to his liking. ~ Financial Times  Bank of America’s latest global fund manager survey showed the largest number of global investors on record intending to decrease their holdings of US stocks since data collection began in 2001. Seventy-three percent of respondents said they think US exceptionalism has peaked.~CNN  >Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, said Trump appeared to be “panicking” due to the plunging markets and still-high US Treasury yields, as well as investors’ apparent loss of confidence in the US dollar.  >Rising living costs, economic disarray and popular discontent will eventually force a definite pivot of Trump’s approach. ~Xu Tianchen, analyst   >Other trade issues beyond the tariffs also need to be discussed, according to Zha. “One way to do that is to return to the working-group mechanism and launch evidence-based negotiations,” he said. Zha Daojiong  >Trump added that Beijing would not be laying out the terms for a deal and that the US – led by Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and the president himself – would “be setting the deal and it will be a fair deal for everybody”.   The most amazing, beautiful, very nice concept of a deal the world has ever seen. It's sitting right next to his amazing universal beautiful health care plan and just to the side of his solve Ukraine in a day and egg prices by noon.   Half of us elected a 2 bit gossip fodder grifter to run the country, and he chose 2 bit look the part incompetent sycophants to carry out his inept stubborn orders.

"China can force Trump to remove all tariffs before any trade discussions are entered into.  He has tried to humiliate China on countless occasions and it can now force him into a humiliating backdown.  Whether or not it wishes to weaken him completely or give him a small face saver is unknown.  It certainly does not owe him any favours but may prefer to keep a weak, bumbling and cowardly leader in place rather than deal with an unknown.  Should he remove all tariffs on the basis that trade discussions are entered into then , once lifted , China may take the position that free trade is the new norm and give him nothing. This would be poetic justice.  Whatever the outcome Trump has destroyed any trust and confidence with its former trading partners. China has used this to build new trade relationships and establish itself as a reliable trading partner in the stead of the USA.  Unfortunately, for the global economy , Trump's chaos has discredited the USA economically , militarily and politically.  US bonds and the USD are no longer considered safe havens and it is most likely that the US is already in economic recession.  This flows onto the global economy and it is likely that the six ( seven? ) time bankrupt felon has accelerated the onset of a global cyclic economic recession.  The US has in the past often been the first into recession and the first out of it.  Now that the USD and Treasury bonds are on the nose it will make recovery so much more difficult than before.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-23T07:01:49,34

"Trump's motto should be Make China Great Again. China is filling the void created by Trump. It will in time be seen as the great country that comes to give aid during disasters. It will be  the great country that builds roads and bridges and brings prosperity.   Already the brain drain from America to other countries has begun. The experts we tossed out will be happily poached by China and Europe. Brilliant scientists and students will find nations that appreciate them. We will eventually become a second world butt of jokes... America, China, and the EU walked into a bar. China and the EU ducked.   And we allowed it to happen. Like Romans in Britain watching helplessly open mouthed as the Centurions left their posts, we will wonder when our greatness will return. Sadly, a long slog through the Dark Ages of Christian Nationalism awaits us. We did this to ourselves. Half the country elected a buffoon because they mistook a character on a grade B TV show for a real person.   And the billionaires behind him are not patriots, they are selfish actors who care about their own wealth and nothing else. They would not have poured so many dollars into Trump's coffers, spent so much time fawning and flattering him to elect this clown unless he became their personal puppet. The rest of the nation be damned. Billionaires are global. They will ride this out and be stronger in the end.    Many Trump supporters interviewed have an immature wish to see things blow up. Many are clueless, but don't get upset until they themselves are personally impacted. Selfishness seems to be a shared characteristic.   Hey, remember when roofs were made of tiles?",SicilyMalta,2025-04-23T06:38:52,60
"I really do think he was just too stupid to realize his absolutely idiotic plan would destroy the economy. He legitimately believed that he could just swing tariffs around and the world would bow to him and treat him like a god, and he'd show the world and smart and powerful he was.   I know the conspiratorially minded will say it was all a ploy to crash stock values and buy them on the cheap, but I really don't think that's it. Sure, they took advantage of the situation once they saw everything was going tits up, but I think that was largely reactionary. Trump really is just that stupid.   And he's going to look for any means possible to avoid narcissistic injury. He needs people to believe that he is smart and capable and in control. So he'll say he's ""giving the economy medicine"" or ""that this was all part of the plan"". He'll wipe tens of trillions of dollars off the market value in the coming recession, all the while saying the economy is doing better than ever before, and if there is any issues, it's someone else's (Powell's, Biden's, Vance's, whoever's...) fault (and he'll likely say both of these things at the same time).   This is the thing about Trump. He is the perfect amalgamation of stupid, selfish, and shameless. He's dangerous in 50 different ways, because he's not *just* evil, he's not *just* dumb, he's not *just* morally bankrupt, and he's not *just* an agent of chaos. He's all of these things at the same time. And the American people have handed him complete control. If America dies, the cause will be a self-induced cultural carcinoma. And it's becoming really hard to imagine how it can all be turned around.",Zarmazarma,2025-04-23T07:21:15,27

A smarter approach would have been to subsidize manufacturing or just have government built infrastructure in place to bring the most critical production back home.

He promised tarriff cuts IF a deal was made and the market thought it was a done deal because certain news outlets were cutting the last part out. ridiculous.  Whats scary is that other articles say shortages can begin as soon as 2 weeks from now if the trade deals dont start soon. This is what scared Trump during a meeting with CEOs.  China can wait and has all the reason to wait along with everyone else.  What better humiliation for MAGA than bread lines and empty shelves?

The one-child policy was always loosely enforced and enforcement varied by province. There were also loopholes (e.g. more children if you haven't had a male heir yet for most provinces, more children allowed if both your parents were single children) and it's been outright banned. Even without loopholes, many families just outright ignored the fines and had more children and just didn't register their kids. This is why kids were undercounted.  At the same time, their elderly have been overcounted because Chinese pensions aren't that bad (for their cost of living). As morbid as this sounds, many families cheated the gov't and conveniently forgot to report deaths so that their deceased grandparents could keep collecting checks.  And I don't know what productivity metric of productivity he's looking at, but the quantitative measures we have of productivity are like GDP or Gini per hours worked, which is nonsense here. We could look at academic output, but I suspect he wouldn't do that, because China is completely crushing it. I remember 20+ yrs ago, the top global engineering universities were almost all American.

Russia didn't have any real democratic foundation or history in place so it was much easier for Putin to consolidate power and go full on dictator and mass murderer.  I'm not saying Krasnov hasn't expressed similar ideas or ambitions as Putin but luckily he has been somewhat restrained.   One thing I will point out where he has Putin beat, is that at least Putin actually is loyal to his country and does care about increasing Russia's power and defeating its enemies.
