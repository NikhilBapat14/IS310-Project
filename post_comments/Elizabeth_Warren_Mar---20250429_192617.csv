"Normally Trump's people will try to mitigate Trump's lies whenever he is about to speak, but now, ""What he says is the truth, period.""  No pretending it was, ""misheard"".    Trump just wants everyone to live in his ketamine filled fantasy world.  ""Being woke"": Being aware of the lies from the people in power and not fall asleep to its apathy.  Anti-woke is their moto.  No wonder.  ""Believe in our lies, it's your one and only duty.""",Taurius,2025-04-29T20:05:56,209
