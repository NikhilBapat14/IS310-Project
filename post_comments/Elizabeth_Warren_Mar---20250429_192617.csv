"Normally Trump's people will try to mitigate Trump's lies whenever he is about to speak, but now, ""What he says is the truth, period.""  No pretending it was, ""misheard"".    Trump just wants everyone to live in his ketamine filled fantasy world.  ""Being woke"": Being aware of the lies from the people in power and not fall asleep to its apathy.  Anti-woke is their moto.  No wonder.  ""Believe in our lies, it's your one and only duty.""",Taurius,2025-04-29T20:05:56,209

"From reporter Jennifer Bendery:  Donald Trump is 100 days into his second presidency, and to mark the occasion, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) plans to read into the congressional record what she says are 100 cases of Trump using the presidency to personally benefit himself and his allies.  “One hundred days, one hundred acts of corruption,” Warren will say in a Tuesday night speech on the Senate floor.

For instance, the senate literally just voted to appoint another Trump appointee yesterday and not a single Democrat did anything to make that process as difficult as possible; in fact 14 of them voted with Republicans to move forward with the vote as fast as possible probably because they had some PAC luncheon with lobbyists scheduled or some other corporate DNC bullshit to take care of.

The people who support her are highly educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what. She’s bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party. We need to turn out disaffected working-class voters if we’re going to defeat Trump.""  That was it. That's all they had to say.

FFS...  Then she got 4 staffers who weren't even in the private meeting between her and Sanders, to lie about what was said at the meeting. Warren claimed Sanders told her a woman couldn't beat Trump. Sanders said:  “It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn’t win. It’s sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren’t in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course!
