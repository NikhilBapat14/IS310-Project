"Medicaid is already a ""provider of last resort""   An employment guarantee is something that the far left has been pushing for for a century.  But it runs quickly into the problem of ""we're forced to hire 6 million people, what do we even do with them?"".  It's easier and probably cheaper to just go with unemployment insurance.    The root problem with housing isn't that it's intrinsically expensive, the problem is that there isn't enough of it.  Government subsidized hosting doesn't help with that.    If your goal is to ensure a robust private sector of whatever industry, then the very first thing you do is to kill any publicly owned competitors in that industry.  How are private for-profit companies going to compete with against a multi-trillion dollar entity that never needs to turn a profit?  How are they going to hire workers when workers already have cushy government jobs doing nothing?",Nothing_Better_3_Do,2025-04-26T07:16:26,5
">If you cannot find other employment, then you can work for some department whose role is to provide such employment at the prevailing pay, compensation, and other conditions of employment, as a way to prevent cyclical unemployment (people shifting between jobs or are taking parental leave or are in hospital not counted)  This will brand you as damaged goods for any future employers, and would ensure you're trapped in this kind of job.  Moreover, if the service is worth providing, then why not always provide it? If it's not, then why bother producing something people don't think is worth paying for.  Even if so, this is a source of cheap forced labor, so it creates a vested interest in local policy makers to keep unemployment high.  Overall this solves a non-problem: you want to make use of the unused labor, but the market has clearly already indicated they don't need it.  >If you cannot find cheaper housing, then you will be able to get it while paying some amount (such as 30% of your paycheque), with an auditor assigned to ensure they are safe and capable of providing for your needs at least at a basic level.  Employers on a labor market where labor has to take what it can get will just lower wages to account for the now cheaper cost of living.

"As a physician, i know for a fact that you can run a very cheap healthcare system as a “last resort” that actually has decent outcomes, and a lot of countries already implement some version of this. I also know for a fact that nobody will like it and nobody will buy into it.  You probably would mainly see nps/pa or in training resident physicians, abd the nursing role would be replaced by cnas. You will likely have  limited interaction from an attending physician, whose job is primarily going to be oversight and man. You would also only be able to get generics which are likely 20+ years old for free even if they are slightly suboptimal or inconvenient to take. You probably would have very limited access to specialists and elective procedures. In the inpatient side. If you get hospitalized, you wouldn’t get private rooms or free meals etc….

"The big issue I have is with:  >If you cannot find other employment, then you can work for some department whose role is to provide such employment at the prevailing pay, compensation, and other conditions of employment, as a way to prevent cyclical unemployment   The reason I can't find full-time employment is due to disability and employers now unloading 2-3 jobs onto a single person, expecting 60 hours of work a week plus commute if the pay is even slightly above median. I can't hear well. I also have autism, which prevents me from having a job without a work-life balance because I will burn out in 2-4 months. It'll take even less time if I have no PTO and am stuck doing more than 40 hours. I can work. I kept my last full-time job for 10 years because they provided a generous PTO policy and let me use the PTO. I didn't even use *all* of it during my final two years of employment because I really didn't need or care to. Just, I will not work the bullshit 9-5 without any time off who doesn't accommodate me because I care about my mental health. It also wouldn't work with the fact that a lot of the areas with high unemployment are rural. Without it being WFH and without it including skilled training, it wouldn't help those who need it most. So, basically, this really wouldn't help in the long-run. If you had the work-life balance, decent pay and decent benefits, people would shit on it and it'd become deeply unpopular due to the propaganda that would stem from it because their company doesn't have it and we live in a bucket of crabs type culture.   The best option is to untie living well from work, and force those employers to recognize that labor is a free market too. The only way to do it is to take the desperation out of it. Yes, it's a bit radical, but it's really the only way to fix the current labor conditions. If the only reason people will work for you is because they'd starve or have a roof over their head, you as an employer must fix things. I personally do legitimately enjoy working and being productive, I just won't trade my life to work like so many seem to expect me to.   tl;dr handing people work doesn't fix the larger root of the problem.",Cursethewind,2025-04-29T11:23:22,1

"Add having been employed this way to the list of things employers cannot discriminate against, although that would be aided by other provisions for making sure discrimination in general doesn't happen. And the social valuation of a program like this can change over time. In the past, it was seen as a disgrace for women to work in the work systems men did, now it is far less so.  In some cases, markets don't always provide what you would normally expect to want, sometimes because of employers, sometimes for other reasons. The Great Depression comes to mind as one instance of this where there were many employees who would have worked but the structural incentives messed things up. It saw a huge deflationary crisis, and if everyone thinks that prices will be lower in a month, then you don't want to spend anything now, but this reduces the amount of money that those who make things to be priced have to work with and so they lay off more people. You can see public transportation providing a lot of benefits to places but individual companies don't have that much of an incentive to make transportation like this. The fact that a country is likely to remain in place for the fifty or a hundred years is a stabilizing force for such a transportation system when you want to invest into things, but a company is not nearly so likely to be able to deal with such a long term project.  And the labour isn't forced here, you have to ask for the job in the first place and cannot be made to accept it. They just can't refuse a qualified applicant. The fact that you have to have exhausted alternate employers would be an element in keeping this type of program stable. Plus, there are a good number of ways to make employees have to do better than this threshold, such as a collective bargaining system, maybe minimum wage hikes, maximum wage ratios (EG you can only pay the highest paid CEO or officer asy 8 times as much as the least paid among them), that competition may exist with other firms seeking the same labour pool and so has to attract them with better things, and such pool which knows it can fall back on this type of employer of last resort rather than being jobless, those should help.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-26T11:19:46,0

"In the case of the medicaid thing, it's largely what people have been saying by public option. You would pay into the plan, usually out of your paycheque.

The idea is that they can't reject a person willing to pay the insurance plan unless they are doing it for something like criminal fraud purposes.  The jobs one has a premise that the work is still safe and fulfilling. It would probably also be the type of employment that might not make sense for a private employer to create, maybe economies of scale make it infeasible or the capital upfront would be unsustainable, or it would be too risky for a single employer to try to enter into but an employer of thousands of people would have manageable risks. Maybe a job removing lead pipes if a person is qualified in plumbing.   The expense can be part of the idea to a degree.

"> If the ""last resort"" work you were to do were profitable, why wouldn't a private employer find a way to make that profit?  There's lots of work that's valuable but not economically viable as a business. A core function of governments is to do that work.   For example, lots of rural mail routes wouldn't be served if not for the USPS.    There's also lots of work, such as necessary maintenance and improvement of various pieces of infrastructure, that private industry might be able to do *cheaper*, but the government is ultimately still paying for, and it could be argued that the benefits of an employer-of-last-resort type program might outweigh the additional cost over contracting that work out.

"We have a lot more standards than Victorian workhouses did. Plenty of ways an auditor can find misconduct or bad conditions. Remember that in the Victorian era, those people couldn't vote.  As for the exhaustion, one option is to have employers be required to post job openings on some registry with the associated qualifications, compensation to be offered, geographic location, and other relevant details, so that anyone could look up those opportunities. That would be a good way to determine if there isn't work open to people.  Sometimes work and what is good for an economy isn't always a very sensible thing for a market to do alone. We have seen that the interstate highway system and electrification projects done in the 20th century gave a big boon to the economy, but would have been difficult things for companies to build alone. Same with the transcontinental railways, which were subsidized by grants and guaranteed land among others. There are different kinds of reasons for different fields of the economy, but they exist.   As an extra feature, it is completely possible for this idea of employer of last resort to mostly actually be companies and cooperatives which aren't literally part of the public authority, they are given a contract or agreement to take on those identified by some agency as needing work in this way. Same thing as what happens when some agency wants something like a piece of infrastructure built and hires a contractor to build it. In Canada, most doctors offices are actually independent practices, but the ordinary citizen doesn't pay them, an insurance system by each province and territory deals with the financing and creates some directives as to what they have to do.  This idea is separate from the idea of a UBI. Labour can be a thing done for its own sake, to improve the prestige of people, to give them things to do rather than potentially being angry, to give people a sense of purpose, to make people active in general, giving them skills and things to put on a resume, to make colleagues and friendships and give them connections to other people they might not otherwise do, to give companies something they have to compete against in order to attract personnel with better conditions and remuneration, to potentially introduce them to trade unions, to give people something assured of when they pursue education and a reason to pursue that education in the first place and not to fear potentially swamping the marketplace and reducing their own bargaining position if they graduate with a lot of people with similar qualifications, and more.

">""Cost"" actually wouldn't be the issue today. 300k workers at $4.60 an hour is just under $3B, which is peanuts in the federal budget, so even adding administration and oversight/trained foremen wouldn't be that big a deal. The issue today would be the sub-""living wage"" pay and terrible conditions (tent cities and/or barracks life) for backbreaking manual labor work. Add the nexus of poverty and unemployment with racial minorities, and you're effectively enshrining a racially-based underclass.  Sure seems like you could use the first half of that paragraph to fix the second half...  Though I will say that according to wikipedia that number in today's terms is more like $93B  Increase the cost of the program and raise the wages.  There's also a *whole* range of programs designed to prevent the work from being backbreaking, but I'm taking wagers as to whether it will outlast the current administration (OSHA, worker's comp etc.)  If those go by the wayside, then it really wouldn't be any different than private work eh?  >So again, good examples of the government historically doing things, but I don't think the CCC in particular is an especially good example or model for an ""employer of last resort"" program.   The reason I call those employers of last resort is because it was designed to limit one per household and was intended to go only to those suffering long-term unemployment.  >Full employment, which was reached in 1942 and appeared as a long-term national goal around 1944, was not the goal of the WPA; rather, it tried to supply one paid job for all families in which the breadwinner suffered long-term unemployment.  >[...]  >The WPA reached its peak employment of 3,334,594 people in November 1938.[19]: 547  To be eligible for WPA employment, an individual had to be an American citizen, 18 or older, able-bodied, unemployed, and certified as in need by a local public relief agency approved by the WPA. The WPA Division of Employment selected the worker's placement to WPA projects based on previous experience or training. Worker pay was based on three factors: the region of the country, the degree of urbanization, and the individual's skill. It varied from $19 per month to $94 per month, with the average wage being about $52.50—$1,173 in present-day terms.[20][22] The goal was to pay the local prevailing wage, but limit the hours of work to 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week; the stated minimum being 30 hours a week, or 120 hours a month.  You could certainly pay more for the workers now if you wanted to.  Again, the intent was to provide work *alongside* other benefits as well as ""the dole"".  So this was less of a full-time job, than a job for the sake of maintaining skills and giving people something to do *with and for* the community.  You also have to remember that in the case of the CCC they were providing clothes, shelter, and meals to the workers.  Tent cities on the streets of LA are very different from the government camps built for the CCC.  The latter were upgraded to barracks in many cases.

"The commentator you are replying to is likely assuming UBI would be paid for via individual income taxes (which IMO is a fair assumption as this seems to be the most likely way to implement this system). In this situation a UBI mathematically works out to be the same as a negative income tax since even though everyone technically gets UBI, there exists some point at which their increased income taxes wipe out any actual gains from the UBI and thus works the same as the ""minimum standard"" for the negative income tax.   The specific program implementation deals (in particular *when* the money is paid out) could obviously make a large difference but in general, you can structure a negative income tax system such that the net monetary payouts are identical to UBI paid for by progressive income taxes. Since people's balance sheets *look* different though, there may be a difference in political support (which is likely why the above commentator called it ""means testing for normies"").   Now if one plans on paying for UBI without individual income taxes, there might be a way to structure a negative income tax to work the same, but that math gets very wonky very quickly and I'm far too lazy to do it so I'll just go with the assumption that they would be different in that case.

"What makes you think that they are unnecessary just because companies didn't create the position? The government runs the military at a loss but people usually despise the idea of private armies to the point that such a force is a war crime and you can be shot after trial for it. A publicly run army is seen as a good for the people in general in large part because it is publicly run and not in the hands of anyone else.   And you also make a presumption that it is not profitable merely because it would be a public programme. The British Broadcasting Corporation Studios, the commercial arm, is profitable, £224 million pounds of profit from 2022-23 fiscal year. And even if it didn't completely recoup it all, it could recoup a significant fraction of it to reduce the expenses that must be paid for in other ways.   There are roughly 1.5 million people in cyclical unemployment in America as an example as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If 90% of them were eligible for this program, which probably should not be assumed but I'll use it, that gives 1.35 million people. The federal government is not meant to employ them directly. It would mostly be doing coordination although it might accept some of them for some federal purposes such as working on federal nature preserves. At least a million I would think, possibly more, would be a level down. Assuming that they are evenly spaced and 150 thousand are employed federally, this means that even the biggest state, California, would be dealing with about 144 thousand people. But even with this, the state level might not directly employ them, and counties would preferably be organizing much of this. Again assuming a similar spread relative to population size and the state directly employs 24,000 people or 1/6th of them, you would be looking at about 30,000 people employed by the biggest county in the state.  The federal bureau is mostly to coordinate, and a substantial portion of the states' involvement is coordination as well, and hammering out some of the details. And as I have said before, many of these might be people who are actually directly employed by a company participating in a public programme, perhaps receiving a subsidy or tax credit if they hire a person to be employed as part of the programme.   There are a lot of ways this kind of programme could be devised and to limit the risks you are observing here.   Markets are not all the end all and be all nor are the definition of what makes a good idea. Market efficiency with blindly buying things at maximum efficiency doesn't always produce the outcome you actually desire. A country like the US could save a lot of money if they asked China to build it their weapons and ammunition but this would come with a lot of problems even if they are cheaper. As just one example of outsourcing in that field, countries often bought Swiss weapons but now are finding that they cannot participate in certain international objectives their citizens might want them to do if they want to transfer them to Ukraine, if for no other reason than to wear down the resources of an expansionist tyrant for relatively not much of their own money, because Swiss IP law and export controls on weapons preclude the purchaser from using those weapons that way. It would be cheaper to run elections without a secret ballot and by electronics, but you can probably start thinking about a lot of ways that would go wrong. By the way, this can be true of corporations as well, it can be better to take a hit in some cases than to always do the pure market value of something. Maybe someone whose creative legal interpretation of a reward program generates a lot of PR and news coverage, if you just go along with it like accepting 299 bananas as being worth some household electronics, it can be cheaper to just take the bananas and give them the electronics rather than deal with any backlash or lawsuit. Lots of instances happen like that as any corporate lawyer can tell you how often cases settle.   Having a programme like what I describe has benefits in a number of ways that aren't just for markets in the short term. It makes people believe more that their country cares about them, and won't leave them behind in times of trouble that could happen to anyone. This can raise voter turnout when people believe in their country and that the right way to run it is with a well contested but peaceful and fair election, and being able to trust in things like that is going to be many many trillions of dollars cheaper than thos sort of programme would ever come close to costing.",Awesomeuser90,2025-04-26T16:42:55,1

Let’s see how much Sr really care.  They get to vote and there is more of them than anyone else.  Let’s just see what happens in the mid-terms.",mcgunner1966,2025-04-27T07:36:03,1
