It’s annoying and dangerous that a few people are willing to risk their lives to screw over the people who cannot get the vaccination because of allergies or health issues.  Anti-vaxxers are the most selfish people possible.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-26T09:10:24,2470

"I discussed this with my doctor. I'm on a very expensive immunosuppressant for an auto immune disease. If I had to get a booster for measles, since it's a live vaccine, I would have to go off my therapy drug for several months before I could take it, and then a tad more time for the vaccine to do its thing. During that time, my underlying disease could come roaring back. Even if it didn't, for biologic based immunosuppressants, if you pause treatment, you have a high risk of your body creating antibodies to that drug rendering it no longer an option for therapy. Since there's only a limited amount of biologics for a given disease, this takes a big option off the table.   Long winded way of saying thanks anti science idiots. Your stupidity has put my life and wellbeing at risk.",crohnscyclist,2025-04-26T11:35:20,34

Liberal and left-leaning people are the ones who are loudest about vaccinations and public health. You have to realize that by definition, if a conservative sees their political enemy advocating for something, by default it is quite literally like bugs Bunny and Daffy duck doing one of those go ""I don't wanna! I do wanna!"" Then bugs Bunny flips the sign saying ""I do wanna!"" Then Daffy saying ""I don't wanna!""

"A big part of where US politics is now is due to a “head in the sand” approach by senior DNC political figures to addressing the violent racist impulses in the fabric of American society.        Part of my point is that you were hopeful because the image you were presented was probably blissfully ignorant of the malignant cancer of racist and authoritarian backlash brewing in response to Obama’s election and popularity;  examples:     https://www.france24.com/en/20081124-parts-obama%E2%80%99-election-sparks-white-backlash-usa-race        https://www.splcenter.org/resources/reports/racist-backlash-greets-president-barack-obama/        https://unfinishedlivesblog.com/2012/06/09/anti-gay-racism-hits-new-low-pastor-lynches-president-obama-in-effigy-for-supporting-gay-equality/        https://www.jstor.org/stable/25790447.       After the crippling failures of the Democrat party to push back on damage to civil rights and civil society caused by the Bush Jr era, it was again a deep failure of DNC politicians and media to highlight and criticize conservative rhetoric which sheltered and cultivated violent racist ideology and shaped the national dialogue. The likes of Fox News, Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and more recently Andrew Tate, Jordan Peterson have overtly poisoned minds of multiple generations. Joe Rogan is a good example of someone who shapes dialogue by entertaining abhorrent and dangerously delusional views without any criticism, any evaluation involving critical thinking. This failure is on par with the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schulz deciding to concede state legislatures across the US to the GOP without contest during the Obama administration years.

"Agreed. There was also a massive wealth transfer during the 2008 financial crisis that decimated the middle class, increased poverty, and made the rich far richer.   The political class, emboldened to ignore the electorate by Citizens United, which effectively legalized bribery, ignored the situation entirely.   Millions of people were ignored as their financial situation deteriorated. They grabbed on to any promises of a better life they could find, and regrettably, it became the lies of Donald Trump that resonated most loudly and effectively with them.   He was able to focus their wrath on internal 'enemies', with his racist and anti-immigration rhetoric, and somehow convince the electorate that he could return them to a halcyon past. They were willing to suspend disbelief in the hopes of getting their heads above water.  The aging and out of touch Democratic leadership is really doing the nation no favors right now, as they continue to ignore the most critical issue - the economy.   Trump is currently **trashing** the economy with his tariffs (the impact will be far worse than even the most pessimistic financial reporter is predicting), and there will be financial and social pain that will dwarf 2008 or the pandemic.   Yet, the Dems seem incapable of fixing their attention on this one critically singular issue that could return them to power. Every other shiny issue, other than the economy, seems to grab their attention, making them look disorganized and weak.  I am optimistic that the Dems will finally become focused on the economy in the next few months, because it will naturally eclipse every other cause and issue.

"Christianity is not the issue. The issue is that a lot of people who claim to be Christians either blatantly cherry pick what they want out of the bible to fit their own personal agenda or don't read it at all.  I think part of the issue with the modern Chriatian faith is how most people who claim to be followers of Christ were indoctrinated into the religion from a child, a time when they didn't know any better. And so, for many, many generations, you have had people pass down this religion like a family heirloom. Many people who are Christian will (ironically) ostricise their own family for not following this tradition.  And what ends up happening is that people grow up thinking ""I have to be Christian or else I'll go to hell"" which ends up with people claiming to follow his teachings without actually pondering their meaning. So now you have people who claim to follow Christ but have not read his teachings in the Bible or have only read the passages that their parents or priests have cherry-picked out for them.   What now happens is that people view Christ as a perfect figure above humanity and yet are blind to his ideals. A lot of the time, people will now think ""well, I hold this one social view to be true, and I know that I am a moral person, so Chrsit, the most moral being, must also hold this view"", or ""well, my priest or parents have said that Jesus holds these ideals, so even though I haven't read anything about him holding these ideals, they said he did so obviously he must"".  Either they baselessly hold the belief that Jesus holds these ideals or they cherry-pick Bible verses that support their view while leaving out the ones that don't.   This is how so many self-proclaimed Chrstians, particularly in America, have justified slavery, segregation, misogyny, queerphobia, xenophobia, and the general ""othering"" of those different to them.  The issue basically is that instead of reading Jesus' teachings and coming to your own conclusionion about whether or not you wish to follow them, most modern followers of Christ are coerced into it from birth.",VegaMain,2025-04-26T15:47:38,6

It's one thing to intentionally watch the news and think about what's being said - it can be exhausting. It's another when someone just puts on Rogaine in the background and nods along.  I'll argue we need our defenses on all the time in today's informational environment, because of how easily propaganda is thrown in to casual listening. That's effectively my point. I don't think people do this - and in a lot of ways I can't blame them.",BorisAcornKing,2025-04-26T14:09:46,1

"Technically, it was variolation, with a weaker strain of smallpox, rather than vaccination, which originally used cowpox.  Both of those are risky procedures, they were just safer than the alternative.",Ananiujitha,2025-04-26T15:21:50,6

"I mean vaccination isn't 100.00000% safe either, it's just vastly safer than the alternative. Yet too many people use this as an excuse, because they point to those risks, while downplaying the much more impactful ones from the diseases themselves. To some degree this is understandable because most people tend to be bad at considering and comparing risks without training, but that's *why we rely on experts because they're literally trained to know more about it than we do.*  And yeah, you shouldn't just mindlessly trust what some guy says, regardless of their title/degrees, but again, the fact that we have *other* experts we can ask about that is why we know that asshats like Andrew Wakefield are full of shit, and other doctors/scientists/etc telling us that the vaccines are the better choice by far are the right ones, because scientists/etc peer review each other, and critique each other. etc.",The_Lost_Jedi,2025-04-26T19:45:59,3
