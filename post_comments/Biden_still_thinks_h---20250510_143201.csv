I don't understand why we have to ignore that Biden was extremely unpopular by his 4th year. Maybe you personally like him but the country did not.    If kamala had any sense she wouldn't have ran at all. If she had any sense now she would blame Biden's historically low approval rating. But of course admitting that means admitting the VP never should have been chosen as his replacement    So instead we live in our own little bubble where we pretend all the polls are wrong and Biden was some beloved figure who just aged out. In reality he had record low approval ratings leading up to that debate anyway,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-10T15:33:40,1

Yeah we can argue that to death or we can pick the best candidates to win elections    I think Biden didn't get any policy done his last 2 years that really won him a lot of voters. His 1st two sure. He did checks. He did the EITC. But he had nothing to sustain that.    Regardless of why his numbers in April of the election year were some of the lowest Gallup had ever seen. At that point it is too late to litigate his presidency. It's too late to bring in his VP.    Kamala has admitted her own internal polling never had her winning.

You should read up on Hindenburg. Biden and Hindenburg are not similar in any fashion.   Hindenburg popularized the idea that Jews stabbed Germany in the back and lead to their defeat in WWI. He ruled as a defacto dictator completely bypassing the Reichstag. Hindenburg is the one that suspended civil liberties after the Reichstag fire.   Hindenburg & Hitler are very similar in many ways.
