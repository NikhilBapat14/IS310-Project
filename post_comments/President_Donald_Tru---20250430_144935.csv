"When the stock market was shooting up under President Biden, Trump claimed all the credit for the rising market for himself, even though he was not president and had not been for four years.   Now when the market is collapsing  because of his tariff, Trump claims that he has zero control over the economy and that former President Biden is full control of the stock market.   A child could lie better and more plausibly than this.  Are Trump's MAGA minions really stupid enough to swallow this?",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T15:10:23,13

Could also be the aliens. I heard they used illegal immigration to build the pyramids.  Legend says that it was a Trump relative who chased those pesky aliens away back then in order to make Egypt great again. They found a few Executive Orders on stone tablets.,Zarniwoooop,2025-04-30T14:53:34,5

"Trump seems to shoot himself in the foot anytime he tries to “fix” something.  He either doesn’t understand what GDP is, or he can’t explain what is happening.  If he were savvy about messaging, he’d claim the GDP reduction without hesitation. The GDP sank because companies stocked up on imports destined to be tariffed. That means the US imported more than it produced. In addition, government spending sank.  He claims he wants more of a privately driven economy and not a government driven one.  Well, it happened, but then he says it was Biden? And how did Biden cause companies to import more?  Dems need to get much better at discussing these nuances than just howling at everything. Obviously, once the inventory dries up, there will be bare shelves, and high prices.  That needs to be put in Trump’s face. Don’t let him craft the narrative by responding with juvenile name calling and “slams”. Have a correct, and well articulated response.",Spin_Quarkette,2025-05-01T05:21:03,1
