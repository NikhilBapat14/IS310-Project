Absolute clown show. Such incompetence. And at such a critical junction in world history.,c0xb0x,2025-05-10T15:13:21,1
Trump doesn’t make these decisions.  He rarely is deciding anything unless it is some stupid economic policy regarding tariffs.  The tariff president that made an unforced error and had little ideology.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-10T15:24:18,1

"From the article:   Nesheiwat’s credentials came into question last month...  As if we shouldn't be calling into question the credentials of not only his next nominee, who dropped out of residency. But hey, I'm sure she has some great sunlight in a jar to sell you to ensure you don't get the autism virus!",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-10T17:27:54,1

"He is.   I also suspect he has functionally split up parts of the presidency to various cabinet members and said it's fine for them to be independent. And some of the fuck ups are because each one is acting like a king. Hegseth wants a nazi-like military. Noem wants to be cruel for her own fun, and play dress up. And Stephen Miller probably is directing a lot more than he should be. So in a way we don't have a president, we have many.",GoodIdea321,2025-05-10T17:07:21,1
She's still the most recent one though right? Wasn't there another that was sacked before this? Hard to keep track of all the incompetence,musKholecasualty,2025-05-10T16:33:46,1
