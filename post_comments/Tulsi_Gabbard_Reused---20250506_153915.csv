Several former adherents told The Journal that they believe Gabbard received the name ‚ÄúShraddha Dasi‚Äù when she was allegedly received into the group. Gabbard‚Äôs deputy chief of staff, Alexa Henning, responded to questions from The Journal at the time by [posting them on X](https://x.com/alexahenning/status/1882878102059299138) and accusing the news media of publicizing ‚ÄúHinduphobic smears and other lies.‚Äù",WoofWoofster,2025-05-06T16:07:29,31
