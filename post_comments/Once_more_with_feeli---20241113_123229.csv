The new rules are doing this based on the post flair rather than anything else.  That's a whole new door that I've wanted to open for a while too...,AuditorTux,2024-11-13T12:34:08,1
"Since it wasn't answered in the other thread... Another question... and I think it might just be the appeals process is the answer... how exactly would we get sources/links to answer a questions that is subjective in its answers. Like ""Why do Republicans believe..."" sort of thing. Some new policies, like the Republicans not caring much about opposing gay marriage anymore, don't really have a policy-based reason. Its just because its not a popular/winning message anymore.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-13T12:50:19,1
"Hmm, maybe I'm missing the point. Are only answers that are factual conclusions wanted? For example, if the question is ""Why did X happen?"" then the only acceptable answers are ""Because of Y and here are sources for Y""? Rather than hypotheses for further discussion such as ""Maybe it's because of Z"" which opens the door to more discussion and replies attempting to prove or disprove Z, perhaps with sources.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-14T01:04:20,1
">Some new policies, like the Republicans not caring much about opposing gay marriage anymore, don't really have a policy-based reason. Its just because its not a popular/winning message anymore.  So what I would do in this example would be to do a google search for something like ""conservative opinion on gay marriage polling over time"", open a handful of replies in new tabs, and pick one or more sources which contain recent and relevant data and links to primary sources (or at least say exactly where the data came from) if it isn't a primary source itself.  Heck, you should do this before you start writing, so you don't find yourself wasting time.  [This was one of the top results I got](https://news.gallup.com/poll/646202/sex-relations-marriage-supported.aspx), which includes polling data from 1996 to 2024 showing that support for gay marriage among republicans increased from 16% in '96 to 46% in 2024, with a peak of 55% in '21-'22.  As for the *whys* that would be more speculative, I agree, but it's good to start with a framework that supports the premise.  But even still, the ""Bottom Line"" touches on it to an extent:  >As the percentage of Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or something other than heterosexual continues to rise in the U.S., public support for same-sex marriage and views of the morality of same-sex relations remain high  ...  >With younger Americans consistently more likely than older Americans to favor legal same-sex marriage and to view same-sex relations as morally acceptable, public support should resume its growth at some point in the coming decades, should younger adults and new generations entering adulthood maintain higher levels of support.  Circumstantial evidence is leagues better than no evidence, you just have to work a bit harder to make your case than if you had a smoking gun.  And if nothing else, it can be helpful to be clear which parts of an argument are backed by hard data, which are supported by circumstantial evidence, and which is speculation grounded more in lived experience and anecdotes.  If you wanted to argue that greater representation in media is a factor, you could include a quote [like this](https://student.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2022/02/17/lgbt-history-month-a-history-of-lgbt-representation-in-tv-film/comment-page-1/) (from a quick google for ""gay representation in media over time""):  >Since 2005, GLAAD has published an annual report to show how representation is changing in TV. In the 2005-2006 season, 1.4% of regular characters on broadcast primetime shows were LGBTQ+, whilst in 2020-2021, the figure was up to 9.1% – and over half of these characters were people of colour. It is important to remember though that more can be done – the most recent study found that 20% of these LGBTQ+ characters appeared in a series created by just 1 of 4 TV producers.  And while we've all heard that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, it's not like the correlation proves the opposite either.  Not a smoking gun, but a plausible basis for further argumentation.",Zeydon,2024-11-13T14:32:45,2
