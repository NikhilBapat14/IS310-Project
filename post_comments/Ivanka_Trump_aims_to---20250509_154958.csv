"""In 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that 18 million households (13.5%) were food insecure, meaning they had difficulty at some time during the year providing enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources.""  The US has given Ukraine what amounts to roughly $4,800 per Ukraine resident. That would have come in handy for those 18 million US households which could have received roughly double that had we spent the money on our own people.",cossbobo,2025-05-09T16:04:14,1
"The problem with these issues is our country is too large. If every individual state was its own “state” country and we had a group agreement similar to the EU where we have free trade and travel and a unifying currency, then these issues would be able to be tackled. The fact is the interest of california is not supported by nebraska and vise versa. You can never expect a country this diverse to be unified on issues and what to spend money on.  I whole heartedly agree with ur sentiment tho",edgyteen03911,2025-05-09T17:55:06,7
