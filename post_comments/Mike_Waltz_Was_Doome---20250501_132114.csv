"For weeks, Washington has been waiting to see how long National Security Adviser Michael Waltz could hold on. The answer, we now know, was 101 days: [https://theatln.tc/V8heDmMt](https://theatln.tc/V8heDmMt)  Waltz is expected to be ousted by President Donald Trump. “His firing comes roughly seven weeks after he added The Atlantic’s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal chat in which top administration officials discussed a strike on Yemen before and after it took place,” David Graham writes. “In legal and security terms, the mortal sin was conducting official business in an unsecured and unpreserved forum; in political terms, it was including Goldberg.”  “Any other national security adviser would have been deservedly fired after the leak, but even without Signalgate, it’s hard to imagine that Waltz would have survived very long,” Graham continues. “Waltz was one of the more respected and expert hands on Trump’s team, and that would have doomed him sooner or later.”  “Waltz is a right-winger and a convert to Trumpism, but he is not a blind loyalist,” Graham writes. As national security adviser, he tried to bring his expertise to the service of the president; the problem is that “Trump doesn’t care about national security. He’s not against it, or actively trying to undermine it; he’s just not interested. He’s not interested in hearing reasoned advice, developed through a careful process, as the National Security Council has done—especially if this advice contradicts his impulses or ideology … On marquee issues that Trump can’t ignore, and where tough trade-offs and complicated strategy enter the picture—such as with Ukraine or China—someone has to start giving him news he doesn’t like.”  “Now Waltz joins a list of discarded Trump national security advisers, alongside Flynn, H. R. McMaster, and John Bolton,” Graham continues at the link in our bio. “That unhappy fraternity is only likely to grow. Every administration official serves at the pleasure of the president, and nothing incurs this president’s displeasure faster than trying to get him to care about national security.”  Read more: [https://theatln.tc/V8heDmMt](https://theatln.tc/V8heDmMt)",theatlantic,2025-05-01T13:22:01,1
