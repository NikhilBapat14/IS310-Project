"It's not accurate that more people have voted.  At least, not at the presidential level.  [In 2020, there were 155 million ballots cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election), in 2024, [there's been 150 cast.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election)  It's possible, although extremely unlikely, that there's more people who voted entirely, but refused to vote for president.",scubafork,2024-11-18T15:12:35,14
"The truth is, we don't know yet. [Some states are still counting.](https://apps.npr.org/2024-election-results/house.html) The voter files won't be released for a couple weeks still.  However, 2020 had the [highest turnout \(as a percentage of voting-age population\) in 60 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections#Measuring_turnout) It's highly unlikely that 2024 will rise to that level, but [estimates](https://election.lab.ufl.edu/2024-general-election-turnout/) are that it'll still be higher than any election since 1968, excepting 2020 of course.",nosecohn,2024-11-18T17:00:35,5

"Turn our was *down* for Democrats when compared to 2020.    That's because in 2020, Democrats ran Joe Biden, who is a terrible candidate who set historical records for Democrat turnout in 2020 and is 11-0 in national elections.    In 2024, Democrats ran an excellent candidate who ran a near-perfect campaign and so turnout dropped significantly compared to 4 years ago. https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html  Conversely, turn out was *up* for Republicans. That's because Republicans ran the same candidate that lost in 2020, but he had additional baggage due to Jan 6th and his many felony convictions.    https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-voter-turnout-republicans-trump-harris-7ef18c115c8e1e76210820e0146bc3a5",WhiteOutSurvivor1,2024-11-25T19:38:18,2
"Counts aren't final yet, so the number for this year will keep going up for a bit. It's unlikely it surpasses 2020, but it'll probably get pretty close--probably 1 or 2 million less than 2020.  What I suspect the PBS report was referring to is the fact that a number of the swing states had record-setting turnout. But turnout was down in most of the non-swing states, so national turnout wasn't record-setting even despite high turnout in the key states.  To answer the OP's question--turnout definitely wasn't *low* this year. A lot of people across social media claimed it was after election night (talking about ""twenty million missing votes"" or whatever), without understanding that many states can take a while to count, and that California (which accounts for millions of Democratic votes) and big cities (who also have a lot of mostly Democratic votes to count) often report final counts late. Turnout was reasonably high but not as high as 2020.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-18T16:39:57,14
Thatâ€™s what I thought. Not saying you are wrong in any way but what was PBS on about?,Demonyx12,2024-11-18T15:57:16,1

"The data only goes back about 90 years, but based on percentage of eligble voters who did actually vote, [2020 was tied for the highest turnout *ever.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_United_States_presidential_elections)  2024 had a reduced turnout compared to 2020, and therefore it is accurate to say low turnout could have cost dems the election. At the same time, 2008 (Obama), 2020, and 2024 all had Significantly higher turnouts than any other elections since the 1960s, so it is also accurate to say turnout is on the rise.   And when you dont look at percentage (as you should) but insteaad just look at the raw numbers, the 152 million and still counting that 2024 is at does put it solidly as the second highest turnout ever, which could be what PBS was saying.",bmilohill,2024-11-18T16:47:38,4
"The assumption, I guess, is that there's over 3 million more ballots that haven't been tallied yet, which seems highly unlikely.",scubafork,2024-11-18T16:12:32,3
