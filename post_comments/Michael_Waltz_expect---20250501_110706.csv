"Waltz, not Hegseth?¬†   ""This move comes as President Trump has been increasingly frustrated by Waltz after he came under intense scrutiny for inadvertently adding a reporter to a Signal chat with top Trump officials discussing a U.S. military strike on Houthi rebels in Yemen.""",Lebarican22,2025-05-01T11:07:57,50
To be clear: Trump is not upset about the illegal Signal group chats.  He is upset about Waltz spilling the beans.  The illegality was intentional.,Timothy303,2025-05-01T11:24:52,28
The fact that he's leaving suggests that he was one of the smarter ones,Rosebunse,2025-05-01T11:22:43,18
Waltz is the fall guy. At least he didn't fall out of a window.,baby_budda,2025-05-01T11:38:39,13

And now the fall guy so hegseth can remain,jafromnj,2025-05-01T11:46:59,5
The official narrative about this is going to be nothing but lies.   Don't buy it. Make sure others don't buy it.

First Signalgate scapegoat. I'm surprised it took this long.,lnc_5103,2025-05-01T11:48:46,5

I‚Äôll bet it is because Trump ‚Äúlikes the look‚Äù of Hegseth more.  Everything about Trump is shallow.,InAllThingsBalance,2025-05-01T11:10:16,42

So basically Trump has a man crush on the Tom Brady of fox news.,clocksteadytickin,2025-05-01T12:20:03,4
It's because Hegseth will suck trumps ass. He proved it in his interview where we changed the subject from himself to how much of a victim dear leader is and how the attacks he's suffered pale in comparison,rlovelock,2025-05-01T12:53:17,3
