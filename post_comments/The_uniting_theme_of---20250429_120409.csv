"Stupidity. Cruelty. YEAH, Ineptitude.  ...but the cult is purposely staying in the dark, still ignoring the blinking red lights. When they can't fix their lawnmower or when it costs them 8x what it did last season, they'll blame Biden.   The 40% of the voting population that still supports him will never change, pride will always get in the way. Pride is a hell of a drug that his followers are addicted to...that and a dependency on racism",Fair_Escape5101,2025-04-29T12:10:33,12
"Nah. The underlying theme is SCAM. This is trump’s, hopefully, final scam.",fowlraul,2025-04-29T12:19:51,5
"It was the same during the first term, too. Worse now because he seems so intent on breaking things and being more disruptive, but like the first admin, it could be so much worse if they actually knew what they were doing.  PJ O'Rourke's line about republicans is as apt as ever. 'The Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected and prove it.'  It is an irony that the party which espouses the meritocracy are generally so inept, though right wing hypocrisy is nothing new and worthless to point out because they are shameless with it so nothing will change.",travio,2025-04-29T12:25:34,4

I'd say corruption is the uniting theme... ineptitude is a close 2nd.,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-29T12:12:52,2

"I think that's a naive take.   They are doing terrible things behind the scenes.    There's no evidence that the very public dumb scandals aren't manufactured to distract us from the dark sabotage we don't see.   For instance, Musk has ransacked every government database that holds highly private information about average citizens.  Information that was very strictly segregated so it could only be accessed on a 'need to know' basis.  Why would Musk be allowed to break security protocols that protect you and me?",insuproble,2025-04-29T12:10:16,3
