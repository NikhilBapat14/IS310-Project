"When it comes to Doctors, I want my Doctor to have been top of his class. I don't care what color or even what sexual preference he or she has, I want Excellence, not just Competency.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T08:05:59,56
And the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota (of course) simply renamed it.,vampirepomeranian,2025-04-27T08:27:33,15
"These fools don't understand how much damage this does, and not just at the competency levels that people here are speaking about.    Because I can tell you this, with how much racist and sexist behavior these programs have, it makes me unsure that anyone in the healthcare industry (or others) that is not a white male actually is competent in their job.    A white heterosexual male doctor who graduated in recent times tells me that they are so good that they couldn't be beat out of the system. I can't have confidence in women, minorities or any other thing than WHM because of these policies.    It is creating systemic racism and sexism on it's own, and even worse in a country that it truly did not exist until it was manufactured again post 2010.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-27T11:09:01,9
"DEI has infected our schools for well over a decade.  The last time I sat on one of those admissions committees, we were admitting women and minorities with much lower test scores in order to achieve higher diversity rates, which we promptly cheered on.",Texas103,2025-04-27T23:29:03,1
"Out of all professions that should be based on merit, you'd think the healthcare industry should be at the top of the list. The cost of medical care has skyrocketed in part to how expensive malpractice insurance is, and this won't make it any better.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-27T08:14:37,23
I used to have a computer business before I retired.   I had several Doctors as clients. Had to sign HIPAA Contracts to work on their servers. Depending on what their specialization was they paid 100-200K a year just in malpractice insurance costs.  And yeah... Students should ONLY be advanced based on merit and skill. I don't need to die having my tonsils out because some anesthesiologist give me too much of some sedative or end up brain dead or something.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T08:20:16,9
"Agreed. Airline pilots are another example. People who are entrusted with the lives of others should only be the best and brightest, regardless of skin color.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-27T09:16:00,5
