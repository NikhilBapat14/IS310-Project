"From Tina Sfondeles:      Longtime Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky on Monday told friends and supporters at her annual Chicago luncheon that she will not be seeking reelection, setting up a competitive race for the seat she’s held since 1999.  Schakowsky’s announcement, which was anticipated, puts into place yet another game of political musical chairs in the state, along with [the race to replace outgoing Sen. Dick Durbin](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/04/23/dick-durbin-senate-reelection-decision-krishnamoorthi-underwood-stratton). Schakowsky, 80, is serving her 14th term representing Illinois’ 9th Congressional district, which includes several North Shore suburbs, north neighborhoods in Chicago and portions of the northwest suburbs.

Thank you David Hogg and the young people of the DNC for putting pressure on the old guard.,Instant_Ad_Nauseum,2025-05-05T16:57:25,-1
There is already a progressive influencer running. [Kat Abughazaleh](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/24/illinois-progressive-congress-member-attracts-gen-z-challenger-027500),gradientz,2025-05-05T14:01:09,19

"Schakowsky has held the seat since 1999 and was considered progressive. She’s been fine, but it’s time to pass the baton to a younger generation. There’s way too many geriatric politicians.",JewsieJay,2025-05-05T15:53:31,2

She's quite literally a carpetbagger who just moved there in July 2024 and voted back in their previous district of Washington DC in November 2024. She doesn't have a chance in Chicago's electoral machine.,Satanic_Warmaster666,2025-05-05T14:11:13,-11
He literally called out Jan as one of two people he wouldn't primary on multiple occasions.,2pnt0,2025-05-05T19:40:04,2
I can't wait until he primaries Bernie Sanders.,GrabaBrushand,2025-05-05T17:44:25,-2
She quite literally addresses that in her announcement video. You’re saying it like she’s got nefarious motives and she’s been hiding this info from the public.,JewsieJay,2025-05-05T15:46:18,14
Bernie does not run as a Democrat.,2pnt0,2025-05-05T19:40:43,2
Let's run a younger independent. He's old and needs to be pushed out.,GrabaBrushand,2025-05-05T19:41:54,-1
