">""I knew it would be a controversial piece,"" the sculptor, Rapid City native Jim Maher, told News Center 1. ""I had friends that told me it would ruin my career. I had other friends tell me that it'd be the greatest thing I'd ever done. I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle of that.""  I may be optimistic, but he seems blissfully unaware of the likelihood it could just be torn down ala Saddam Hussein-style in the future.",Parking-Emphasis590,2025-05-06T09:32:47,26

I'm not sure it is. Why is it controversial? The city's tourism board has funding to go towards creating and maintaining statues depicting each President. This isn't unusual or out of the ordinary.
