"The leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, gave [two public reasons](https://www.businessinsider.com/wagner-boss-yevgeny-prigozhin-breaks-his-silence-after-aborted-mutiny-2023-6) for the since-aborted uprising:  - Remove/replace the Minister of Defence and Chief of the General Staff  - Prevent Wagner PMC from being subsumed by the Ministry of Defence, as all private military personnel were ordered by the Kremlin to be put under contract with the defence ministry as ordinary soldiers  Neither objective was met, [and his actions were condemned by previous allies](https://www.politico.eu/article/prigozhin-insurrection-russia-ukraine-war-destined-to-fail-weaken-putin/) like the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and Sergey Surovikin, the general who commands Russia's air forces.  Whether or not Prigozhin had objectives greater or more complex than what was stated publicly, he did not succeed, and has been excised from his role as state-sponsored warlord.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-06-26T12:10:01,2
"Idk that I'd call it a ""rebellion"" per say.  At time of writing, to the best of my knowledge, we don't have a lot of hard evidence that there was actual *fighting* happening between Wagner fighters and actual Russian soldiers. Prigozhin *claimed* that Wagner forces were targeted and some of his fighters killed but we haven't really seen an independent confirmation of that.  From the best of my understanding, there's two potential scenarios that are more likely happening.  First, this is an in-house spat that indicates some deeper problems within the Russian system. It's *very* notable that Prigozhin avoided direct criticism of Putin and reserved the majority of his ire for the Ministry of Defense and the Russian army. It may be that Prigozhin was kind of tired of getting treated the way mercenaries tend to get treated by more professional armed forces and threw the equivalent of a tantrum to try and be seen more on par with legitimate Russian forces which, if that's the case, that was a pretty poor way to go about it.  Assuming the downing of the Russian aircraft did actually happen organically, that was not a small thing. Russian hardware is not easy to come by right now and at least one of those was a *very* expensive strategic plane that can't really be replaced nor can the people who were presumably on it be replaced.   Prigozhin throwing a fit to get Putin to step in and tell the military to ensure that Wagner actually gets supplies might work *to a degree* but Putin can't be there personally to ensure that the military is actually cooperating and I can't imagine that the Russian equivalent of calling in dad to back you up is going to win Prigozhin and Wagner a lot of friends.  The second scenario is this is a huge play, staged to generate buzz.   That would be....interesting but not totally wild. Russia is suffering mightily and a ""coup"" inside Russia would help take the attention off the fact that Russia is in bad shape right now as well as potentially feed into the notion in the West that ""it's over, Ukraine doesn't need us anymore, let's stop supporting them.""  A big part of Russian policy is deliberate obfuscation to keep people guessing and this might be just another installment in that. Again, remember that we haven't really seen much objective evidence that Wagner forces and Russian soldiers have actually fought. It's a ""coup"" with very little indication of actual fighting despite there being claims of it happening.   I'm not sure how far the verification has gone of Wagner's downing of those Russian planes but if there's similarly little hard evidence of that happening as well, that supports the idea that this is theater for some reason.  Whatever the case is, what should be *very* worrying to Putin were the videos of Russians greeting Wagner troops when they entered Rostov. There was a lot of people who were enthusiastic, happy, and very supportive of Wagner fighters who, at least as far as they knew, were staging an uprising. That's a worrying sign to an autocrat. Even if this whole thing was fake, when your own citizens come out with flowers and food for people they think are forcibly fighting back against the state that's an incredibly bad sign that there's a decent amount of popular resentment towards you and your government that someone might be able to harness at some point.  What happens now is kind of anyone's guess. Prigozhin is cooling his heels in Belarus, I think he might be just a bit too popular among Wagner fighters to be used as a window tester at the moment but two weeks from now we might read about a ""Ukrainian bomb drone"" or ""missile strike"" that kills him. It's really too early to tell how this will shake out at this point.  Putin can't really afford to alienate Wagner too much. They fulfill too big of a role for Russia domestically and overseas, but they're also absolute psychos so that needs to be factored into whatever Putin plans to do with them.",HeloRising,2023-06-29T03:32:45,2

Will the Wagner Group continue fighting in the Ukraine war now? Or will they be disbanded?,Experimentalphone,2023-06-27T07:38:54,2
"It""ll be divided. One structure will continue under the MoD command, another will be relocated to Belarus (allegedly) and will concentrate on african and ME business but i think we are going to see a sequel to the coup later",xeiogold,2023-06-28T19:34:48,2
