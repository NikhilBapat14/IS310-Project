"From the article:  Though Maga supporters represent a small subset of US Catholics, it's one with outsized access to conservative media and Trump's ear.  On Bannon's War Room podcast - known for its hard-right, pro-Trump bent - one guest after another heaped criticism on the new Pope.  ""This guy has been massively embraced by the liberals and the progressives,"" said Ben Harnwell, a journalist who led Bannon's efforts to establish what he calls a ""gladiator school"" for the ""Judeo-Christian West"" outside of Rome.  ""He is one of their own‚Ä¶ he has [Pope] Francis's DNA in him,"" Harnwell said.  Jack Posobiec, another Maga commentator dialing in from Rome, was blunt: ""This choice of the American cardinal was done as a response, as a message to President Trump.""",kootles10,2025-05-10T15:53:24,1

"Yes. The children of faith will non-violently resist until their death; then, Jesus comes back to avenge those who were persecuted for His name sake (ironically, by those who proudly proclaimed His name in vanity).  The following verse is like history repeating itself. The Senate named Caesar as Dictator Perpetuo to wage war unencumbered, and they had to stab him in the back to regain the power they gave away.  ~Revelation 12:4 - ""And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.""  The 2nd beast with power to call down fire from Heaven (rocket man) would build an image of the 1st beast and cause it to speak (AI replacement to manipulate his popularity, making him the true leader). Essentially, a disgruntled employee is going to destabilize the Starlink constellation, symbolically like every dagger in Caesar's back.",Vapur9,2025-05-10T17:09:03,1
