"From the article:  Though Maga supporters represent a small subset of US Catholics, it's one with outsized access to conservative media and Trump's ear.  On Bannon's War Room podcast - known for its hard-right, pro-Trump bent - one guest after another heaped criticism on the new Pope.  ""This guy has been massively embraced by the liberals and the progressives,"" said Ben Harnwell, a journalist who led Bannon's efforts to establish what he calls a ""gladiator school"" for the ""Judeo-Christian West"" outside of Rome.  ""He is one of their own… he has [Pope] Francis's DNA in him,"" Harnwell said.  Jack Posobiec, another Maga commentator dialing in from Rome, was blunt: ""This choice of the American cardinal was done as a response, as a message to President Trump.""",kootles10,2025-05-10T15:53:24,1

Why is it you want the day of the Lord? It is a day of darkness. Not light.  It’ll be like if a man were to flee from a lion, only to be mauled by a bear. Like if he entered the house and leaned up against the wall to rest, only to be bitten by a snake.   >Is not the day of the Lord darkness and not light? A day of gloom with no brightness at all!  >I hate, no, I *despise* your religious festivals. I will not delight in your gatherings.  Even if you offer up sacrifices and offerings to me, I don’t want them. I will not even look at your peace offerings and your fatted calves. Remove your songs from my presence. I will not listen to your psalms. But let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a raging river.”  The reason for God’s rejection of the people?  They despise those who insist on justice. They hate those who tell the truth. And later, in chapter 8, he says “they sell the poor for a pair of sandals.”  For those kind of people, the prophet Amos says the people who want the Lord to come back to save the world are gonna be surprised to discover that they’re the ones the rest of the world needs to be saved from.

"Yes. The children of faith will non-violently resist until their death; then, Jesus comes back to avenge those who were persecuted for His name sake (ironically, by those who proudly proclaimed His name in vanity).  The following verse is like history repeating itself. The Senate named Caesar as Dictator Perpetuo to wage war unencumbered, and they had to stab him in the back to regain the power they gave away.  ~Revelation 12:4 - ""And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.""  The 2nd beast with power to call down fire from Heaven (rocket man) would build an image of the 1st beast and cause it to speak (AI replacement to manipulate his popularity, making him the true leader). Essentially, a disgruntled employee is going to destabilize the Starlink constellation, symbolically like every dagger in Caesar's back.",Vapur9,2025-05-10T17:09:03,1
