Carful. You can’t let the truth out that republicans are responsible for things republicans do.,Thumbkeeper,2025-05-01T07:54:48,22

The most maddening thing about this is how pointless it is. Trunp isn't materially benefitting from this and no one wanted it before the Republicans were told to. He's destroying the American economy and harming the world as a whole for ***literally nothing***.,DuringTheBlueHour,2025-05-01T09:08:34,5
"it didn't help that one democrat wasn't there to vote, enabling the tie and letting vance break the tie with a no vote",Deadhead602,2025-05-01T08:45:06,4
"I was told, by a very reliable source, that this was all left over effects of Bidens Economy overhang.",Huxley077,2025-05-01T08:16:19,8
He's doing it for his boy Putin. That's what he's getting. He's a traitor.,Witty-Entertainer524,2025-05-01T14:57:18,3
"I’m wondering if that was intentional. Mitch McConnell was also going to vote against them and also wasn’t there.   So I’m wondering if (knowing that it would never get through the House anyway) they planned to set up a vote that required JD Vance to break the tie, to get them *all* tied to the tariffs like a sinking anchor.",gringledoom,2025-05-01T08:57:12,4
"As ICE and FBI are empowered to do warrantless searches with no PC and to send people to foreign prisons with no Due Process, I have been told that Democrats are the real fascists because, you know, vaccines",AdAccomplished6870,2025-05-02T08:20:28,2
So we could all suffer?,MelissaMead,2025-05-01T13:14:45,0
"I mean, this vote wasn't going to fix the tariffs anyway. They'd need to pass it in the Senate, pass it in the House (wouldn't happen), Trump would veto it, and then they'd need to pass it with 2/3 majorities in both the Senate and the House (\*really\* not going to happen in the near term).",gringledoom,2025-05-01T13:32:26,1
