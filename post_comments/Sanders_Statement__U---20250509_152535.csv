Sanders is absolutely right. These USAID cuts are a death sentence for millions.,MiHop89,2025-05-09T15:46:44,6
Millions of dead children are exactly why Republicans cut the funds.     Starvation is even better than bombing for Republicans because is  slower and the victims suffer more...   Right wing politics is nothing more a collection of thinly veiled pretexts for the gratification of sickening sadistic impulses.,Beantown-Jack,2025-05-09T15:35:44,10
"Bernie.  They just don't care. In fact! That means more for them. That's all they care about. Period.   Greedy little shits always wanting more and more, until there's nothing left.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-09T16:20:12,3
Not only will Trump’s administration be responsible for many US deaths due to their anti vaccine campaign they will also be responsible for many deaths worldwide. America will no  longer be a superpower.,Smrleda,2025-05-10T08:08:53,1
Where are liberal minded celebrities during this chaos? Counting their bank accounts obviously.  My fervent wish is to see this government be replaced with an equality for all model. Anything less than that is failure and waste of all this suffering and misery that is being caused. If there isn't a solid reason behind it. Then it's senseless  !!!!!   No more Billionaires...,EvoQPY3,2025-05-10T11:34:34,1
Why can't their own countries take care of their citizens and prevent these deaths?  We're making countries dependent on American foreign aid.,velvet_funtime,2025-05-09T15:26:46,-6
And the people making this choice to cut need to be charged with murder.,Key-Leader8955,2025-05-10T07:25:18,1
"We've systemically exploited the entire world throughout the 20th century.  ""Developing"" countries used to be called ""third world,"" meaning they were the subservient class-- those who make all of our products.   We've summarily executed  millions of people who have tried to fight back and make their country great.   Africa is rich in resources, but corrupted politically, thanks to us.",band_in_DC,2025-05-09T15:28:57,7

"it’s important to have different levels of relationships with other countries. When you’re king of the hill you want allies. They back you up and go to war with you even if it’s dumb. You want your friends. They back you up with words and deeds and let you do your thing. And you’re gonna want those that aren’t good enough to be allies or friends to still be in your sphere of influence. You do this by giving them food and other aid that is a fraction of the total US budget. You toss them what amounts to crumbs and they will let you into their country. they will let you take their resources so you can get your gadgets and whatnot. They let your spies operate in their borders. They turn the cheek when you use them as pawns.   To remain king of the hill, you need all three. Allies, Friends, and subjects, for lack of a better word.  If you withdraw the food from your subjects, you lose them. If you abandon your friends, you lose them. If you turn on your allies, you lose them.   If you want to be king of the hill, you need all three.   If you do not want to be king of the hill, then it doesn’t matter. But let me tell you, life is a whole lot better when you are king of the hill.",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-09T15:54:44,3
Sanders: Millions will die of starvation because of Trump/Musk USAID cuts  You: Let them eat bootstraps!,heroic_cat,2025-05-09T16:00:18,3
"There are many reasons the countries can't prevent those deaths. The US can, though. But to support that, you'd have to believe that America is the sort of country that cares about preventing death, even if they're not American. ",30mil,2025-05-09T15:39:48,2

We should be helping develop their economies but that would go against our plan to make them subservient.,band_in_DC,2025-05-09T15:32:00,4
