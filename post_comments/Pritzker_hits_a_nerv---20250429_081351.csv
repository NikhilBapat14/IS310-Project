"Go back to what Kevin Roberts (Heritage Foundation, Project 2025) said in that we're in a revolution which will be bloodless ""if the left allows it to be.""  The goal of the Trump regime in all the Executive Orders is to promote compliance without shedding blood.  Pritzker puts the Trump regime on the path where the Trump regime will need to take military action against the civilian population, which is how authoritarian regimes end.  Miller isn't stupid.  He's a fascist, but he isn't stupid.    Mass protests aren't their plan.  In fact it would force them into far more riskier behaviors to maintain power with a much higher potential of their removal from office.  Higher, I'd argue, than the ballot box as that's more easily manipulated.  The answer here is Pritzker is right, capitulation isn't the path forward, centrism isn't the path forward, and accepting the risks that are likely to come with mass protests as they build a police state is how this could end.  Lil' Goebbells Miller would prefer we bend the knee.  Let's stand!",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-29T08:49:41,15
IL resident here - that's my governor! I'd vote for a Pritzker/AOC ticket in a heartbeat.,kaps84,2025-04-29T11:39:09,5
"GOP sounding nervous about someone sharing the TRUTH about what is going on.  Also, Miller is a wannabe human being....so there's that.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-29T08:19:44,11
"Pritzker is spot fucking on.  I think conditions also call for a general strike, but in recognition of the fact that we are a million years from being organized enough to do that, I am calling for a general slack.  Do all the professionally important and critical stuff at work, but otherwise do less and slack more, but don't do so little you get fired.  In general also try to do the opposite of what Trump and the other oligarchs would want you to do.",demystifier,2025-04-29T09:02:04,10
"Republicans absolutely hate the shit out of Pritzker, and you'll typically see signs go up alongside their usual stuff that says as much.  So he's absolutely doing something right.",Rynex,2025-04-29T08:23:40,6

"so pritzker’s suggestions are “unhinged”, while the gilded grifter deports (expels) american citizens without due process,  and that’s business as usual?  we have to take it to the streets. if we don’t do it NOW, we my not have the opportunity later.",naonatu-,2025-04-29T09:46:37,1
"The risk is real either way, authoritarianism is here.  Doing nothing and pretend loyalty also leads to ruin--I'd rather take my risks fighting the fascism than being scared of it.",demystifier,2025-04-29T09:04:09,11
