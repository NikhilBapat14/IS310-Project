"Cannabis should not be taxed at all. The tax exemption should be because the government for so long conducted a fraudulent ""war on drugs"" as a tool to politically persecute people and destroy lives.  As the most meager gesture towards reparations for all the victims, waving off taxation for purchasers should be the bare minimum. Especially since there's been no movement in government to provide any other kind of reparations for all the victims of the grotesque and costly fraud perpetrated against taxpayers using taxpayer money.  And increasing taxes on consumer goods is *always* an excuse not to increase taxes on the wealthy. Or creative solutions such as an additional property tax penalty for owners of more than one residential property.  But nope, can't have the wealthy paying an extra penny, let's see which consumer products we can sneak in an unfair tax on.  While the country is entering into a major/recession depression, these additional efforts to squeeze the working class are utterly despicable and disgusting.",ButtEatingContest,2025-05-03T22:17:25,-5
