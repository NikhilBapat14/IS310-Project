"Now the Federal Trade Commission is suing Meta for antitrust violations in federal court — and on April 17, another federal judge found tech giant Google liable for a host of antitrust breaches.  They are about who is going to run this country.  The Constitution opens with the seminal words “We the People.”  But given the power Big Tech has amassed in recent years, one could be forgiven for thinking it starts with “We the Corporations.”  We have come to a moment of decision: Either the government will break up these behemoths and return to the people the power they have seized, or the corporations will effectively be the government for the nation.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T09:14:53,83

Going to be a little difficult since a member of big tech was allowed to downsize many of the agencies you'd need to use to break up or even regulate big tech.,cathbadh,2025-05-05T18:43:43,17
"There's a limit to what you can do about certain monopolies.   Everybody uses the same social media platforms because that's where everybody is. You can split up Facebook from Instagram, but you can't split off half of YouTube to a different platform, and you can't stop everybody ""googling"" things using Google search. These are essentially natural monopolies.   You might possibly bring down the barriers for entry low enough for someone to try to compete, and maybe you can even get AWS to not shut down their servers over leftist outrage, but it's still very hard to wrench a monopoly from a social media platform, and even then the new place will be the new monopoly because that's where everybody is.",woailyx,2025-05-05T10:23:54,11
Not a fan of breaking down corporations just because of “monopoly”. Stop giving the companies who are “monopolies” government protection or subsidies and decrease regulations that set up high barriers to entry. Much more aligned with free market. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-05T09:33:00,22
"Break them up? Break them up into what exactly?  I get the concern but I fail to see a prescribed remedy that gets at the heart of the concern and at the same time lets the free market flourish.  Specific to social media, much of its toxic effects on society is the lack of personal accountability and the willingness to be siloed and spoon fed.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-05T09:43:06,-2

"I’m a **huge fan** of breaking down monopolies.  I’m old enough to remember when AT&T was “the phone company”, for everyone.  You couldn’t buy a phone, you **had** to rent it - and within less than 12mos that rental cost was more than what phones sold for a lot retail right after deregulation.  Long distance was CRAZY expensive, after deregulation  one could pick their own long distance carrier at will and rates tumbled.  Long distance was like $1/minute (+/-) and they was in the 70’s!   Google absolutely **owns** web search and ad networks.  They stifle competition, and as we know have leaned hard into their monopoly to move the narrative nationally, even globally.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T10:34:17,77
"That's how things should move forward, but I think it's still a good idea to break those existing monopolies up. Otherwise they'll still stifle competition.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-05T10:09:16,24
"Yeah, yeah.  I'm thinking things like the CFPB and NHTSA which were both investigating and regulating Musk before he fired them.  or the NLRB that had court cases against him.  Or the people at the EEOC who were investigating him.  Or the parts of the DoT that were blocking his self driving cars that he got rid of.  Or the parts of the FAA that had fined him that he cut.  Or the parts of NASA funding the ISS that he wants to replace with his own product.  Or the FEC that was investigating his $1 million voter registration lotto thing.  Or the parts of the DOJ investigating SpaceX.  Or the parts of the FDA that won't let him put chips in people's brains.  Or the parts of the EPA that went after him for dumping toxic chemicals at one of his plants.  You know, the parts of government that were in his way personally that are now gone thanks to DOGE.",cathbadh,2025-05-06T00:47:10,12
"> after deregulation one could pick their own long distance carrier at will and rates tumbled.  Deregulation is not ""breaking up monopolies"" it's removing artificial market barriers. Maybe a business having high market share is based on coercion and extra-legal bully tactics. Or maybe they just have a completely dominant product.  If you can deregulate and the market frees up, that's an unmitigated good. But that is not modern anti-trust. Modern anti-trust is overwhelmingly frivolous bullshit to punish high market share for political reasons and that's well on display in this editorial. Microsoft was smacked for the audacity to have a browser bundled with Windows. Obviously Facebook should not have civil liability if someone uses their services to break the law anymore than if a crime is conducted over a phone line.  > Google absolutely owns web search  Don't pretend they have a monopoly on search. I only use Google search on rare occasions specifically because it's inferior to its competitors. The only thing it excels in is recency, and with AI improving markedly over the last few years I've even stopped doing that as the AI source aggregation is even better than Google.",cplusequals,2025-05-05T14:47:33,-5
"Who is gonna decide which company is a monopoly and what is a fair way of breaking them up, considering they are already public listed entities? Unless you advocate for bigger government and more regulations, in which case I won’t agree with you. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-05T10:12:26,4
"When they spilt up AT&T they broke up into baby bells, so each baby bell would have to offer LD, and they would carry it.  So as they broke up AT&T they had to change how long distance worked - the no clear “fix” was to force baby bells to allow other carriers to cover LD. In Telecom and the business world the AT&T break up is usually referred to as “telecom deregulation”.  Same in the business world.   And I’m not “pretending”.  Listen, if you want to disagree with a point please do.  But playing 3rd grade games like telling me not to “ pretend” because you don’t agree, is not a game that I play. So you can go play with yourself if you think I’m going to engage with that bullshit.",cliffotn,2025-05-05T15:05:10,6
"I can't say that I have a good answer to that.  But I think that you'll agree that any tech company that suppressed free speech at the behest of a previous administration while dominating a large section of the market should be a valid target.   How large a section of the market is big enough to warrant being broken up? I don't know.   How should it be broken up? I don't know.   My understanding is that the regulations for moving such cases forward already exists, but nobody wants to fight big tech and they're too useful as social control mechanisms. So I don't think bigger government and more regulation would be necessary. Maybe some criminal trials for obstructing 1A rights.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-05T10:21:00,8
"I'm not talking about your specific example of AT&T because that wasn't deregulation. My comment is about how removing regulatory market barriers to entry makes market share less centralized. Local ISPs would actually be a far better example for my primary argument.  But if you want to get punched in the nose over AT&T...  > the AT&T break up is usually referred to as “telecom deregulation”  No, that's a misnomer. It's only called ""deregulation"" by proponents of market intervention. The rest of us call it ""regulation"" because that's what it was. It also didn't result in the benefits you're attempting to link with it. Long distance revenues had already halved (without adjusting for inflation) in the decade prior to the Telecom's Act and almost all benefits that came after are attributable to advances in communications technology (digital switching, fiber optic bandwidth, and the proliferation of cellular networks and VOIP in the 2000s).   > And I’m not “pretending”.  As of this moment you are. You haven't even tried to make an argument that Google is *the* search monopoly even after I've pointed out that they simply have a high market share. They very obviously have many competitors. How can you possibly argue against that?  >  Listen, if you want to disagree with a point please do.  Why dodge my criticisms like this? Don't be evasive. I'm addressing you directly, but you won't even look at my point about Microsoft?",cplusequals,2025-05-05T15:29:20,-2
"Actually I don't think that. Companies can do whatever the hell they want, including censoring on behalf of an administration. It was stupid when the Right whined about ""free speech on Twitter"" and it's stupid now that the Left is whining about ""free speech"" on X. A social media company can censor whatever they want. If it pisses enough people off, they'll stop using it and the company will change course or a competitor will rise. Truth Social and Bluesky have proven that.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-05T10:54:51,7

So now I get it.  You are a troll.  You are somebody who just loves to be pissed off, and wants a target to spray your toxic nonsense at like a cat pissing on a fence.      I engage with that.

"I'm glad you're finally coming around to recognizing markets as an aggregation of information, but the primary issue with ""free speech on Twitter"" was the government circumventing constitutional protections by proxy. Feds were leaning on Twitter to take down speech they didn't like with the justification of ""misinformation"" or ""hate.""  Plus, it's always OK to point out that kind of censorship as morally abhorrent even if it is legal.",cplusequals,2025-05-05T14:26:24,2

Thanks, I appreciate it. I'm pretty confident that my points about anti-trust abuse stand on their own, so I'll just take this generous offer to shill for Thomas Sowell and the Hoover Institution.
