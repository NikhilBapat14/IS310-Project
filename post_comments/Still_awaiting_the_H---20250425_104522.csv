I keep seeing headlines indicating there is a lot of tension and controversy surrounding him.¬†  But if you go back to the poisoned well of headlines the most egregious one is the famous ‚Äúanonymous sources familiar with‚Äù and no screens or proof.¬†  Hmm¬†,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-25T11:45:36,55
I don‚Äôt like some of what he is doing to the military .  Taking away family days and Jenga is kinda silly,MrBobBuilder,2025-04-25T14:15:05,18
"I like the Hegseth pick but the issue I'm having is with the recent firings at the Pentagon, specifically Dan Caldwell, a close ally of his. Dan Caldwell went on the Tucker Carlson podcast and from what he says, I'm concerned. Tucker is strongly anti-war against Iran and he believes that Dan Caldwell was fired for opposing a war with Iran.   My question is, should we be worried about Hegseth at all? Is he really anti-war or is he surrounded by Neo-cons and Neo-Libs at the Pentagon and can't catch some air?",krazyellinas23,2025-04-25T19:01:20,6
"Remember when there was a supposed ""bombshell revelation"" that would surely ""destroy"" Trump's campaign back in October? Then it never panned out.",Trondkjo,2025-04-25T13:34:05,15

The left are like Charlie Brown trying to kick the football.  I never get tired of watching them fall on their faces.,RazorSlaked,2025-04-25T10:49:28,7
You know he was the right pick by how furiously they are trying to take him down.¬†,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-25T11:13:01,6

There's clear work going on by the media and internal operations that want him out.   It doesn't make sense outside of whatever he's doing  people in the DOD clearly don't like it.   Waltz was the cause of Signal Gate ü§Æ. Hegseth messaging time sensitive information to what should be department heads is a nothing burger. Yet signal gate 2 ü§Æ is focus on him?  Someone mention is that the DOD wanted to join Israel on strikes against Iran and Trump and probably Hegseth shot it down.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-25T14:01:54,14
Anonymous sources familiar with the situation have told me Hegseth called someone a big fat doody head on Signal and it's causing big tensions with North Korea.,TheIncredibleHork,2025-04-25T17:39:35,10

"He's smart enough not to micro-manage and smart enough to pass along chain-of-command responsibilities as has always been the case.  The military employs what, over a million people?  That's a pretty deep well for talent.  That aside, he's qualified strictly on his age and go-getting attitude alone.  Recruitment is way up as he impresses exactly the type of recruit to safeguard the nation .. no DEI, merit based assessment and doctrine of fairness for positions earned, loyalty to country, esprit de corp with troops without sex assignment drama, and respect for chain of command.  You can arm a country with tons of hardware, but if you're not qualified to operate it then what's the sense?  I suggest people stop being drama queens over every AXIOS or Politico rag that crosses their desks and let him do the damn job.  So far he's aced it IMO.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-25T14:39:15,5

"If they really thought he would fail spectacularly, why not just voice a little opposition and.. let him fail.  Would look far worse for Trump too. Instead they make it obvious they are trying to take him down. They really like the status quo for some reason",chillthrowaways,2025-04-25T17:41:03,9
I doubt he will be let go. Wishful thinking on your part.,Trondkjo,2025-04-25T13:52:25,5
You can run a ‚Äòmake military manly‚Äô again strategy with any sec def by simply making being in the military manly. Tim Cook isn‚Äôt cool but Apple is cool.   We have a massive procurement problem and also need to evolve all sorts of capabilities into drones. He‚Äôs already pushing for some of the exact opposite into old ideas for infeasible vanity systems. He lacks management rigor and also engineering rigor. He has bad ideas too. All he brings is the pr angle but you can delegate that. He‚Äôs a poor choice for the steady state and lacks the capabilities to disrupt and build up the organization through tech change. Elon would have been a better choice. Thiel would be a better choice. Any number of retired generals are a good choice. There are defense industry execs who are up to it. There are governors who could do it. There are other tech execs who might be interesting choices given the problem.,Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-25T14:42:42,9
"Funny that he deleted his post.  He talks about managing as if he's some mid level bureaucrat.  Anyone can manage, leadership takes talent.  Didn't stop the brigadiers lol.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-25T15:36:56,6
"Management is really hard. It takes decades to get great at it, under increasingly challenging roles. Name another 1 trillion a year well run organization run by someone with zero executive leadership experience. Hell, name a 10b or 1b a year one.  Hegseth has the equivalent of junior director level managerial experience. Not even vp or officer equivalent. He‚Äôs an amateur in one of the toughest jobs in the world.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-25T13:59:52,8

"I'll take someone who finds a rifle more 'cool' over an iPhone any day.  Also, it isn't Chinese made.  He has the smarts knowing there's better qualified people for various departments.  He leads and delegates and doesn't get involved in the daily drudgery of micromanaging.  His is the the most important position, short of the President.",vampirepomeranian,2025-04-25T14:48:33,2
