"Operating in the [dead of night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacht_und_Nebel) is the biggest hallmark of full-tilt dictatorship. It's what unites the worst-of-the-worst regimes, from the Third Reich, to Stalinist USSR, to Pinochet's Argentina. Even an illiberal country, but one which follows the rule of law (however tyrannical the law is) does not need to hide its actions. It does what it does openly and proudly, showing its people it has nothing to hide, and is willing to take responsibility for its actions, however oppressive.  Pre-dawn raids, deportations without appeal, breaking into government offices on weekends so no one is there, is a sign of not only a dictatorship, but a cowardly and unstable one, too afraid to admit to its own people what it's actually doing. Once you accept that as a way for the government to do things, you might as well throw your Constitution in the trash, because ain't nobody enforcing it.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-07T17:19:41,1
"While Musk is distracting his followers on Twitter with vague and misleading claims about his painstaking effort to eliminate ""waste"" and ""fraud"" from the government, he's simultaneously abusing his power trying to protect his company's interests, and he's also secretly deleting information about major ""spending cuts"" from his ""wall of receipts.""  Aside from his obvious conflicts of interest, I want to take the time to illustrate how it's actually Elon Musk and DOGE who are perpetuating fraud, abusing power and mismanaging government operations.  Most of Musk's public boasts on Twitter have been inaccurate or flat out unfounded, forcing him to quietly backtrack.  Musk is taking credit for ""cutting costs"" where credit isn't due. For instance, he's bragging about cancelling contracts that weren't going to be renewed in the first place.  > David Reid, an environmental scientist in Michigan, was surprised to learn his contract studying invasive species... was included on the list. “That contract wasn’t canceled by DOGE or anyone else,” he said. The contract expired on Dec. 31 and he decided to retire and not renew it, he said. “If they took credit for canceling the contract, they’re lying.”  Musk often jumps the gun in making these erratic and false claims about ""massive amounts"" of fraud, but when they're proven to be misleading or inaccurate, he provides no transparency about these mistakes and his grovelling supporters on Twitter are made unaware of just how dishonest this whole operation has become.  And while DOGE is obfuscating data or quietly deleting many of its claims from its website, the remaining so called ""wall of receipts"" is still riddled with accounting errors, outdated data or other miscalculations.  And even as Musk is backtracking, the DOGE website is still increasing the total amount of savings it claims to have gleaned from its cost cutting efforts.  I spent some time on Twitter recently, and it's pretty clear that Elon is not only driving the narrative, but his audience is taking every single word of his as a matter of fact. And whether consciously or not, they put up blinders and disregard any information that might contradict Musk's claims. Which also means that even if data is deleted from DOGE's website, it still remains a fact according to Musk's followers.  One of those claims came early on in Trump's second term, when Musk stated that he had helped eliminate $55 billion (now over 100 billion) in ""government waste,"" but the math says differently. Real estimates show that the number is substantially lower. While keep in mind, many of these agencies, employees and programs that DOGE is targeting aren't even warranting scrutiny in the first place.  As far as more examples go:  Some of the contracts that DOGE claims credit for canceling were sometimes double—or even triple counted.  In at least one case, DOGE claimed that an entire contract had been canceled, when only a portion of the work was stopped. And in other cases, these contracts that DOGE claims credit for cancelling actually ended under the Biden administration.  In another more commonly reported instance, DOGE announced that it had saved $8 billion by cancelling a contract with a company providing technical support for ICE. As it turns out, the contract's actual value was $8 million.  DOGE is also, either intentionally or negligently, making severe miscalculations.  To provide a specific example of how these errors are being made, DOGE recently targeted a contract that it says was for ""DEI services"" for the Department of Homeland security. They claim that by canceling this contract, they saved exactly $5.4 million.  The total cost of this contract was $7.5 million. DOGE arrived at this $5.4 million figure by subtracting an amount that had already been presumably spent.  But it's not nearly as straightforward as this. Analysts say that values like this $5.4 million spending figure are way over-estimated.  This is because spending figures are often undercounted due to the data being out of date. Something DOGE hasn't accounted for in its cancelling of similar contracts.  What's more, the numbers don't account for other costs. Like the termination costs the government will have to pay to close these contracts, making these savings estimates what one expert called a ""meaningless metric.""  Contractors will have to lay off staff, close their offices, terminate leases and get rid of equipment. This is a time consuming process that can sometimes face legal challenges.  In other words, DOGE isn't taking these things into consideration and its math is way off.  But wait, there's more...  DOGE is also making unrealistic estimates based on savings from terminating what are called ""umbrella contracts.""  These are larger contracts where the government sets a ""ceiling"" that represents what it's willing to spend through orders with multiple vendors. These contracts can have ceilings as high as several billion dollars.  And in a lot of cases, the total cost of orders from vendors does not reach these ceilings. But DOGE has not accounted for this, and instead has included the entire cost of the umbrella contract in their math. In other words, it's not real money, not real savings.  Another case involves DOGE *triple* counting savings for contracts with the USAID worth hundreds of millions, and after trying to make up for this mistake, they still ended up overestimating total savings by at least $270 million.  A similar case involves a contract with the EPA for ""DEI"" services that was over counted three times as well.  In another instance, DOGE incorrectly claimed $232 million in savings through a contract with the SSA, when the actual amount was closer to $560,000.  You want to talk about fraud and mismanagement? Look no further, the call is coming from inside the house. It seems that DOGE is perpetuating the actual fraud here. Eliminate DOGE!  What's more, Elon's ""wall of receipts"" includes hundreds of cases that haven't saved taxpayers *anything*. For example, in one case that's been listed, a contract worth $10 million with the SEC actually amounted to $0 in savings because that contract expired a year ago. It's all a scam.  Many of these cancelled contracts relate, in some form or another, to the elimination of perceived ""DEI"" programs. Most of the cancellations listed include businesses that are disproportionately run by women and minorities.  Meaning that this effort is far more ideological than it is strategic. Elon and his Muskrats are simply going after whatever agencies they perceive are operating under some radical left agenda.   And all the while, Musk and his supporters are failing to address, or even acknowledge the fact that his companies are subsidized to the teeth and he is taking active steps to protect his own interests.  Instead, they're acting entirely on their irrational and ideological convictions. There's nothing sincere or even practical about this, one might say it's all quite *wasteful.*",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-07T17:38:17,1
