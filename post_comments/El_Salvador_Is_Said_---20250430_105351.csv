"The president of El Salvador would eat his own sh\*t if Trump ""asked"" him to.  This is political theater of the absurd.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T10:58:11,37
"Trump is relying on El Salvador to refuse as part of his court arguments by insisting the US cannot do anything if El Salvador refuses. This is ridiculous. They are giving El Salvador millions to keep these men and to never let them out. Now that we know the man is alive and healthy, it's quite easy to ask them to return him but Trump -needs- El Salvador to ""refuse"" in order to win their court case. It's a power move by Trump to show the courts cannot order him to do anything. El Salvador has no national interest in keeping him.",ThistleroseTea,2025-04-30T10:58:46,18
The US told El Salvador to refuse to return him,rTpure,2025-04-30T11:02:17,14
So the take away is that a 3rd world country is defying Trump and he's Ok with it.  I thought the messaging was about others respecting us......,MagicBingo,2025-04-30T11:05:26,8
"I'm so confused... I thought they hadn't made any effort at all to get him back. Not that ""sending a diplomatic note"" is much of an effort. But I'm surprised they even did that.  >But in a statement, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said, “In the Oval Office, President Bukele made it very clear he will not be smuggling Abrego Garcia, who is a designated foreign terrorist, MS-13 gang member and El Salvadoran national, back into the United States.”  It makes me so, so angry that Abrego Garcia can't sue people for defamation after all these lies about him. (The part about being a Salvadoran national is true, but not the other claims.)  Well I think Karoline Leavitt is a gang member and terrorist. Why? Because I just know that. I have proof. The proof is because I said so. She needs to be locked up immediately, without due process. We can't continue to let evil criminal gang member terrorist Karoline Leavitt freely roam the streets, putting people in danger. Lock her up and throw away the key!",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T11:03:27,8

All I can say is that “It’s The End of the World” by REM has been stuck in my head since the election,acid-jazz,2025-04-30T11:03:40,3
"The photo looks like if you told AI to:   ""Create a photo of dictator, but make the pants awkwardly tight...in front of tacky gold decor.... and add some douchiness to the face.""",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-30T11:04:37,3
"This is misinformation and MAGA propaganda please downvote...   Trump made the deal himself. We are paying them to house the migrants. There is zero reason he wouldn't be able to return him. We also have constantly seen Trump and the administration show every sign that they didn't want him returned nor that they actually asked.     This is a way for Trump to go ""sorry couldn't do it"", very dangerous propaganda.",ChesnaughtZ,2025-04-30T11:05:03,3
I wouldn't be surprised if most of El Salvador's prisoners are political hostages from around the world.,TheeHughMan,2025-04-30T11:17:30,3
lmao Spurned really? Trump is weak as fuck then. 1 navy battleship off the coast of El Salvador with its sight on San Salvador is all it takes to get every wrongly commited american out of CECOT. Fuck everyone enabling this administration.,MiamiViceTC,2025-04-30T11:20:15,3
"Oh my.  Well then we can all agree:   The US Government should never, ever send detainees to El Salvador.",insuproble,2025-04-30T11:20:57,3
That's not what the el salvador VP said lately,KingThar,2025-04-30T11:16:39,2
So US government commits a crime. Get's caught. Courts order action. Trump ignores the Courts. Trumps says he can fix it but won't. Nothing happens ?,RobbyRock75,2025-04-30T11:16:59,2

"Jeez, it does look like Trump's hands are tied on this one. /s",JFJinCO,2025-04-30T11:39:35,1
This entire article is journalistic malpractice. It's fundamentally based on taking the words of very publicly known liars as true. Everything wrong with our press in one article.,TheCaptainDamnIt,2025-04-30T13:35:45,1
So Trump is weaker than the president of El Salvador? This the strong-man who commands respect MAGA loves so much?,The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-30T17:27:07,1
"Yeah, we really should not let this lie spread.",ChesnaughtZ,2025-04-30T11:05:47,4
He is a citizen of El Salvador and therefore subject to their jurisdiction when in El Salvador.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T13:07:48,-4
I guess trump doesn't run the world after all! 😂,sachiprecious,2025-04-30T11:28:09,6
I don't see why he *couldn't* sue them. The defamation is obvious on its face.,BurnedWitch88,2025-04-30T11:35:01,2
"Well they had to at least pretend to make an effort. As to what is true and what is not, who knows.",Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T17:05:29,1

He isn’t an American. He is a citizen of El Salvador.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T17:08:07,-2
Not really. Deportable aliens who are citizens of El Salvador should be sent to El Salvador.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T13:10:59,-6
Well El Salvador is a sovereign nation not a colony of the United States.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T17:50:34,1
Too late. Now we need to shame Trump for allowing the refusal.   Trump impotent to return migrant.  Impotent ,fairoaks2,2025-04-30T11:20:25,6
"Not to make too fine a point of it, but you can't even communicate from CECOT without outside help, and that only happens at the pleasure of the Salvadoran government.",henryptung,2025-04-30T16:18:05,1

Shame Trump? are you serious?,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T17:46:55,1
"Well, yeah. Obviously the working theory is that this happens after he gets out. He's clearly got bigger issues than the defamation right this moment.",BurnedWitch88,2025-04-30T16:58:47,1
I didn’t say anything about prison and neither did the comment I was replying to.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T14:43:54,0
I hear El Salvador is a safe country now. No one should need Asylum who is a citizen of that country.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T16:45:52,-1
"> after he gets out  To put it bluntly, that sounds like a vacuous truth. CECOT isn't a prison where inmates have terms - they're there forever until the local government wants them released, which at best means four years from now under the pressure of whomever replaces Trump.",henryptung,2025-05-01T03:50:20,0
"It's apparently only safe if you ignore the ""justice"" system it is using.",LangyMD,2025-04-30T20:44:14,1
"CECOT is literally a prison where prisoners are held without due process, indefinitely. What part of that sounds ""safe"" to you?",henryptung,2025-05-01T03:52:49,1
He's already been moved to a different prison. You can stop with the well actuallys now,BurnedWitch88,2025-05-01T06:51:23,2
Is it any worse than ours?,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-04-30T20:54:03,2
I don't think he is in CECOT anymore but there are two separate issues here. Its possible to conclude that he does not have a valid asylum claim without concluding that he belongs in CECOT.,Conscious-Secret-775,2025-05-01T05:46:50,1
"So far, seems so. Trump is trying to mimic what he's doing, but hasn't been super successful at it yet.",LangyMD,2025-04-30T20:56:24,2
