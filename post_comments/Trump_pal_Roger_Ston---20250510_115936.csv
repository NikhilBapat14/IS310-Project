I think the problem exists that the news still tries to report on fascists with the same levelheadedness that they do with any other news.   It just doesn’t work. They need to be calling the behavior out and not just “report the facts”.,nartak,2025-05-10T12:40:52,1

"I’ll concede I didn’t read it. It doesn’t change my comment at all. Their ‘reporting’ results in amplification with a ‘you decide’ approach. Objective lies needs to be called out as such. Not repeated and walked around. Calls for violence need to be called out equally appropriately. Instead they try to play violence  neutral. Not calling it what it is, fascism. It needs done to their faces, repeatedly, endlessly, ad nauseum. At least we can make an effort to break the right wings clip machine that deceives their audience.",love-broker,2025-05-10T13:41:54,1

"Well, if not punishment what about Trump loudly and publicly denouncing him? Telling the American people in no uncertain terms that this is NOT how we handle disagreement in the US and that all people should be free to bring up their concerns to elected officials without feer of violent reprisal.   That should be the bare minimum and it should come swiftly on the heels of such an abhorrent comment, but Stone is just saying what Trump and MAGA can't say or do out lout YET.

"That's entirely separate from your original comment.   >Why does Stone get interviewed in the first place? I don’t care what he says about anything. Media outlets need to stop inadvertently amplifying these toxic messages.  Your original comment literally says they shouldn't be reporting on this in the first place because no one cares what he says, and they are amplifying his words by reporting it.  Sanewashing that the media does is an entirely different conversation and yes, what is most certainly happening way too much.   But again, that's absolutely not what your original comment is about.",undercurrents,2025-05-10T13:47:52,1
