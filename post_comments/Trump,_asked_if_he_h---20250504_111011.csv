Great answer from someone who literally had to swear an oath to uphold the constitution,throwaway150996,2025-05-04T11:19:36,9
Didn't he swear to uphold it in his inauguration day?  He should be removed ASAP. He has no business being the president of America.,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-04T11:38:23,10

Impeachable offense is what I keep seeing but you people really don’t get it….Impeachment does nothing. It accomplishes nothing. Him and all his droogs need to be ousted.,h1storyguy,2025-05-04T12:56:24,2
Of course he fucking knows. The fact he's trying to say otherwise ought to make the little hairs on the back of your neck stand up like stalks of rhubard,The_300_goats,2025-05-04T13:21:48,2
"He didn't just say ""i don't know.""  He said that, followed by equivocating on reasons why he does not have to uphold the Constitution.   He believes that he does not, and also that due process is optional because he is *a traitor to the Constitution.*",inquisitive_guy_0_1,2025-05-04T13:32:12,2

"> I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  The oath of office doesn’t say “uphold”.   The Constitution is encased and under guard and the nerds over at the National Archives are doing whatever museum nerds do to keep old pieces of paper from falling apart.  If someone were to attack the National Archives, Trump would send in the National Guard. The Constitution is preserved, protected, and defended.   /s",wwhsd,2025-05-04T11:34:03,1
Did the journalist point out that he swore an oath to do so or are they still treating him like a child,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-04T11:47:36,1

You can’t expect the president to know the answer to complex questions like this off of the top of his head/s,Lysol3435,2025-05-04T12:34:19,1
Trump supporters are a cult.  There is no way to deprogram that many people without a massive group trauma of some kind.  Either a war or a depression or I don’t know.  We are all screwed.,[deleted],2025-05-04T12:53:33,1

"It’s almost as if there’s an oath or something that we should have presidents take before they are allowed to take office.

Trump can't get out of his own head so he's always going to play dumb as well as infer he is the one with all these powers and not the citizens of the United states.,RobbyRock75,2025-05-04T11:55:49,0
"So many guardrails have been destroyed, bypassed, or removed in the last 8 years.  I hope we recover at some point. But this is going to get a lot worse before it gets any better.",IRideMoreThanYou,2025-05-04T11:19:31,46

"So many guardrails have proven to not actually exist.  Impeachment is demonstrably useless as a form of checks and balance.  SCOTUS and the Legislative Branch have ceded power to the Presidency.  The DOJ has proven it existentially cannot hold the Executive accountable.  Democrats had 2020-2024 to do something about Trump and MAGA-ism in the federal government and chose to do nothing.  America as we believed it never really existed. For all his terribleness, Trump has lifted the veil here to show our form of government actually doesn't work. If we want to future proof against another demagogue like Trump, we need to overhaul the whole system, but it's much more likely Trump will overhaul the whole system, for better or for worse, before anyone gets a chance to stop him.",tweuep,2025-05-04T12:08:13,34

"The thing is, no system of checks and balances are going to work in a democracy *where the voters don't want it*. You can write the best constitution in the world, but if the voters put people in power who don't care about it and they just undermine it at every turn, then it won't matter. It's just a deep civic rot within the country as a whole.",DangerousCyclone,2025-05-04T14:35:31,10
"Nixon was the last president that feared impeachment. When his back was against the wall, he resigned and Ford pardoned him. With Clinton, the republicans were looking to impeach him by day one, when his affair with an intern came to light, Clinton fought against impeachment, and proved that a sitting president can defy the system and as long as your own party has your back, nobody can force you out. So naturally, it's two old perverts who were close to Jeffrey Epstein that have beaten impeachment.",metalyger,2025-05-04T15:11:14,4
Yes but I would argue if we held a more true democratic value of the people’s ideals we wouldn’t have the electorate college. Our voices get lost. We told people their vote didn’t count for so long and then made it so.   The lack of engagement shows the deep flaw in the system with so many “rules” and yet so many “freedoms”,Callmemabryartistry,2025-05-04T15:11:35,3
