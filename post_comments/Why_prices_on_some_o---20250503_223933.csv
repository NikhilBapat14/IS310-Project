"> “subject to a duty rate of either 30% of their value or $25 per item (increasing to $50 per item after June 1, 2025),” according to the White House.  This has been so chaotic that Vox got the item cost wrong.  It's $100 now and $200 in June.",_scyllinice_,2025-05-03T22:47:43,22

This article isn't exactly accurate.  The value of the goods stockpiled and sheer amount simply cannot last through December.  Current prediction I would hazard at is about 2 months.  But I would agree it's sensitive to what industry and what company is stockpiling.  Small business is absolutely toast.,Individual-Motor-167,2025-05-03T23:36:57,9
"The impact so far hasn’t been just confined to goods on Chinese sites. Just browsing a few US retailers, both major and minor, I noticed price hikes on existing inventory in just the last few days. Mostly 5-10% markups. The inflation index is going to be interesting over the next few months. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-04T01:09:58,2

What you get from cheap product sellers like Temu and AlliExpress is competition. If enough people are willing to buy the cheaper products it forces a competition between sellers to attract people with the best pricing. With Temu and AlliExpress out of the retail competition American sellers can raise their prices knowing they don’t have competition and the buyers have no other choice but to buy the (now) more expensive product.,Lost_Minds_Think,2025-05-04T07:26:06,1
