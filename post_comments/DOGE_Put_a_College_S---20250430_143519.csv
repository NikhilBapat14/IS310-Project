"It's pretty clear that DOGE is just about stealing and compiling all the private and secret data that the US government has into the hands of private corporations, right? (And also likely giving some to Russia, based on some reports).  They aren't saving money for anyone. They're stealing data.  The next step I guess is to steal more money from us, by changing government regulations to help large corporations?",0002millertime,2025-04-30T14:37:01,21
"A young man with no government experience who has yet to even complete his undergraduate degree is working for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and has been tasked with using artificial intelligence to rewrite the agency’s rules and regulations.  Christopher Sweet was introduced to HUD employees as being originally from San Francisco and most recently a third-year at the University of Chicago, where he was studying economics and data science, in an email sent to staffers earlier this month.  “I'd like to share with you that Chris Sweet has joined the HUD DOGE team with the title of special assistant, although a better title might be ‘Al computer programming quant analyst,’” Scott Langmack, a DOGE staffer and chief operating officer of an AI real estate company, wrote in an email widely shared within the agency and reviewed by WIRED.  Sweet’s primary role appears to be leading an effort to leverage artificial intelligence to review HUD’s regulations, compare them to the laws on which they are based, and identify areas where rules can be relaxed or removed altogether. (He has also been given read access to HUD's data repository on public housing, known as the Public and Indian Housing Center Information Center, and its enterprise income verification systems, according to sources within the agency.)

As someone who routinely grades and reads year one and two level college essays - I can assure you if they don’t do well with AI.  I’m sure this will turn out well.,PastorNTraining,2025-04-30T18:17:07,3
"The program to parse the data was also likely written by AI.   It's AI coding all the way down with people unable to debug beyond 'ChatGPT, that didn't work, it did X, try again please'",nerphurp,2025-04-30T14:38:42,4

"do they just take the first pass AI gives them? like there's not even evidence they tried to cover their tracks by telling it something like ""make it more natural or human"" or ""get rid of those f\*cking em dashes!""",Delicious_Adeptness9,2025-04-30T19:54:35,2
At least that means that it's increasingly likely large swaths of the stolen info will be rendered useless when the AI used loses the fucking plot a million times over.,TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T15:35:11,5
No…I saw one a year ago where they just cut and paste and yes dashes ALWAYS give it way!  They’re young and that generation grew up with digital tools and kind of use them a lot. Eventually they get more secure with their own writing.,PastorNTraining,2025-04-30T20:00:23,1
