The GOP is nothing but a cult of the personality not a political party representing an ideology.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-04-30T18:26:27,88
Such a strange hill to be on. Tarriff is essentially taxed on the consumers.,Responsible-Mango661,2025-04-30T18:26:37,50
McConnell didn’t vote leaving the R’s with 49 since 3 defected. Why didn’t Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) not vote?!  If he voted along with all other dems it would have passed!!!

Breaking news: Senate Republicans prioritize party loyalty over constituent interests. Film at 11.,Straight-Ad6926,2025-04-30T19:01:41,6
They should've waited until they had the votes. So dumb.,liburIL,2025-04-30T19:02:17,5
The republicans should be renamed “Party of Puss*es.” I give Liz Cheney credit for standing up to him. At least she has balls.,LostmydadtoCOVID,2025-04-30T19:43:38,5
">The Senate voted 49-49 to reject the resolution that would have effectively blocked the president’s global tariffs by revoking the emergency order Trump is using to enact them. GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell, who has before criticized the president’s tariff policy, and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse were set to support the resolution but were not present to vote.

Well now we have republicans on record agreeing with tarriffs and abuse of emergency powers. Meanwhile this feels like another example of lack of strategy and awareness by Schumer like how did they not account for the missing vote.,nkassis,2025-04-30T19:19:30,1

Trump is a weak narcissist.  The GOP are a bunch of opportunistic fake sycophants.  They’re just jockeying for position regarding the pending power vacuum in 3 years.,SniffDsNutz,2025-04-30T23:59:33,7
Explicitly a tax on consumers.,dohrk,2025-04-30T18:43:03,28
"To Trump, they're essential, because he can't cut more taxes on the rich (including de-facto tax cuts via loosened regulations and enforcement) without causing a full governmental budget collapse (that even he doesn't want because it would implode his own power.) Hence, tariffs.  But you're right that it's essentially a tax on consumers, and poor rural MAGA voters will be the *most* impacted. Tariffs should be the number one issue for Democrats, in driving the point home that it's not ""just Trump being rogue"", the entire GOP is behind this disaster. MAGA (and many centrists) don't care about all the other transgressions Trump is committing, but they *will* care if their own bottom line is impacted.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-30T19:06:27,15

You’ve gotta be kidding me :( Do we think he just did not realize…? Ofc I would support what he was doing at almost any other time…  Edit: nvm I guess it would’ve been vetoed anyway tho,adoboble,2025-04-30T18:47:52,9
