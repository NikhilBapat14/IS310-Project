"If only they’d fine/punish employers of undocumented immigrants, maybe none of this Gestapo stuff would be needed.  Lure them here with jobs they need to survive then make them live in fear so they can never complain about mistreatment.",KidKilobyte,2025-04-30T14:12:35,6

">If only they’d fine/punish employers of undocumented immigrants  That's how you know the GOP has never been serous about the issue. They could enforce existing labor laws and go after the big companies hiring these people, but those are their big donors and they prefer keeping the rotation of people in and out of the county as a rage bait issue for their brain dead base",gearstars,2025-04-30T14:26:46,5
"They just want the non-rich to actually fight each other for the shit jobs that pay nothing.  They don't care who is actually working those jobs, and fighting, but racism and immigration are the easy go-to issues to divide people. Also, educated vs non-educated.",0002millertime,2025-04-30T14:35:00,3
