Rubio is a spineless Trump licking tool.   We are literally reneging on the nuclear deal we made with Ukraine (and Russia) at the behest of Putin.   There isn’t a way to make this anything but straight up robbing Ukraine through ultra violence.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-22T16:49:14,20

It seems Cuban collaborator Rubio forgot everything his parent’s taught him.,yorapissa,2025-04-23T06:10:41,1
"Rubio is also spineless against Putin. I really thought he would be the adult in the room out of all his other cabinet picks, but it seems he's just as willing to get on his knees for Putin.",TranquilSeaOtter,2025-04-22T17:29:26,5
