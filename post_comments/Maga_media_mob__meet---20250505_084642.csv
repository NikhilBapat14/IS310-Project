"I think this is all deliberate and intentionally, psychologically demoralizing. it's not just kakistocracy (rule by the worst) though it is that, too. It's not \*just\* putting cronies in positions of power. This is a new thing, uniquely suited to damage America's sense of pride in the complexity, fragility, and competence it takes to run it. It's entirely targeted and purposeful, and it says to us, ""this is such a corrupt and self functioning sack of shit, you could put a reality star in charge of the FAA and it would still run."" That is \*supposed\* to condition is to believe Elon and private industry could do it better (than the FAA, NASA, etc.).  In other words, the entire ruling technique is weaponize incompetence designed deliberately to demoralize the population of a democratic country so that it stops believing in democracy itself. It's a managed decline, a psy ops government, and it needs a new word.  Dysdemocracy: (dys (bad) + democracy) - it's intentionally poorly or absurdly managed to undermine faith in democracy  Neurodemoralism: (neuro (mind) + demoralize + ism) - governing in a way that strategically demoralizes a democratic population  Kakistodirective: (kakistos (worst) + (policy-driven) - policy, people, and governance deliberately placed to undermine the public's perception of itself and it's way of life  This is how the international and domestic vanguard of authoritarians must have thought to take down the mighty U.S.  edit: its antidote is sincere and sustained pride and commitment to community and institutions. In the U.S. specifically, it is pride and commitment to plurality, diversity, opportunity, and merit. We are so much better than what they're trying to tell us we are. it was a democratically built government program that put a human foot on the moon. Don't ever forget that.",vucubcame,2025-05-05T09:02:24,17

The best way to maintain the illusion of press accountability while still holding conferences is to create an echo chamber.  Everything will be controlled.,jediporcupine,2025-05-05T08:47:59,6
