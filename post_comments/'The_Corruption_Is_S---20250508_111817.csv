">The *Post* points specifically to ongoing bilateral [trade negotiations](https://www.commondreams.org/news/trump-india-trade-deal)between the U.S. and India, where ""government officials have sped through approvals of Starlink with the understanding that doing so could help them cement trade deals with the administration.""     I told you this was coming.  Musk is tanking, trying to GIVE AWAY StarLink terminals on CNN, while Trump tries to extort every country in the world.

"Ah yes, the Americans go over to the EU and try to push their bundled services. *You must agree to a contract with our Starlink for us to give you this beef.* After seeing what Elon did with this X thing, it's a very bad idea to let his products into your backyard! We don't even want the Elon culture in the back yard of our country.",postsshortcomments,2025-05-08T11:28:44,8
