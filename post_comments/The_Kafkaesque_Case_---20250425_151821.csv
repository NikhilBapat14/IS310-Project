">It’s worth noting the depth of just how wronged Lopez-Gomez was here. He was arrested and detained under a law that was blocked by a judge and that was not meant to target him in the first place as a U.S. citizen, a double error which deprived him of his freedom. On top of that, this is all acknowledged by a judge who refuses to uphold his Fourth Amendment rights, and instead surrenders jurisdiction of a U.S. citizen who is acknowledged to have committed no crime to ICE, which is not supposed to hold jurisdiction over U.S. citizens. Lopez-Gomez’s arrest was a shocking violation of basic principles of U.S. civil liberties and constitutional rights.  All of the people involved need to be held accountable for this illegal arrest. Sadly, I don't expect it to actually happen.  Here's something else interesting:   >Lopez-Gomez’s arrest is a clear case of racial profiling. He was born in Cairo, Georgia, but spent most of his life in Mexico. He does not speak English, and when stopped, the Florida Highway Patrol officers assumed he was undocumented based on his inability to speak English, and based on his appearance. ",sachiprecious,2025-04-25T15:34:37,16
