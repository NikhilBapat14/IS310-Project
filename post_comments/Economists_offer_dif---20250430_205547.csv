Economist 1 through to 7 : Tariffs are Shite     Economist 8 (who surprisingly has smears of orange make up on his face):  We must bring manufacturing back to the US. There may be some short term pain,neutrino71,2025-04-30T21:00:05,20
The US Dollar was worth 96 Euro Cents on 2/19/25.  It's now at 88 Euro Cents.  The problem is when we have a POTUS who spews lies there is no confidence in US economy.  The Trump Slump is founded on his pathological dishonesty.  If you take a moment to reflect that the US Dollar is not supported by Gold or Silver & it's founded on sentiment.  Swasticar Leiter has devalued Tesla.  Cheeto Hitler has devalued the US Dollar.  This is just the beginning.,Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-30T21:07:17,10
why would pbs try to normalize this bullshit for a conman who's trying to get you off the air?,RepulsiveLoquat418,2025-04-30T21:11:54,5
This sanewashing needs to be treated as fascist collaboration. I am so fucking done with it.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-30T21:24:11,4
"There are valid reasons to want to bring more manufacturing to the US, but it could be done without destroying our trade partnerships, insulting our closest allies, all while we disassemble vast swaths of our soft power mechanisms, allow openings for China to make great gains in the power vacuum.  Short term pain for the greater good, might be a better argument if it was for the greater good, (but the manufacturing jobs of the good old days are not coming back, and this will probably only increase economic disparities) and it was not at the same time we damaged our diplomatic relationship across the world.",thepartypantser,2025-04-30T21:13:44,2
"What is it with these conservative think tank economists siding with these tariffs? Short term pain, long term gain?!? Considering that a mercurial moron is at the helm, backed by a ass kissing coterie, why would anyone invest in these United States in the future?",Condottiero_Magno,2025-04-30T20:57:24,1

"I want an article about ecologists view on the impact of the tariffs. Do the math. The drop in shipping and trucking, the cost of production and disposal… Will Donald’s tariffs become the greenest presidential policy in history? ",appleandorangutan,2025-04-30T21:12:22,-1
"Theory doesn’t always translate into reality.  And hope isn’t a strategy.    Trump should be applying targeted tariffs that have been well researched to provide demonstrated benefits, and should include plans to shut down tariffs that don’t meet predefined objectives within a short timeframe.    Instead, his shotgun approach that shoots at anything that moves has been demonstrated to fail — every time.",tjk45268,2025-04-30T22:58:52,2
"Most of the manufacturing isn't coming back and even the possibility of new industries will be stymied by tariffs.   Biden shouldn't have blocked Nippon Steel's acquisition, as US Steel is in need of modernization.",Condottiero_Magno,2025-04-30T21:07:01,1
"I question whether PBS is really worth saving anymore. :-(  Well, I know it's more than just its news wing. There's historical documentaries, educational science shows, children's programming, most Americans' first introduction to the BBC .... but PBS News really does seem ***dead*** when it's running with headlines like that.",Lurlex,2025-04-30T22:10:38,1
The Treasurys sell off that caused Trump to pause his 'reciprocal' tariffs was obviously coordinated.  Other countries have more cards that Trump thought - especially if they work together.,MJcorrieviewer,2025-04-30T22:17:06,2
"The segment had two economists, the latter living in reality. I do have an issue with NewsHour interviews rarely involving any pushback, unlike British news programs.",Condottiero_Magno,2025-04-30T21:48:54,3

Wait we should actually push this viewpoint it would drive him fucking insane and probably end the tariffs damn fast.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-30T21:47:05,2

"NewsHour is still better than all the other US news networks.   Compared with 20 years ago, there aren't that many repeats of historical documentaries or programming. The culprit is BBC America acquiring all of the programming. 🙁 We paid for a TV license in the 90s, while living in the UK, but the programs were free over the air. I miss being able to watch Red Dwarf and re-runs of Coupling.",Condottiero_Magno,2025-04-30T23:10:14,1
"The rest of the word exists, but our carbon footprint is widely outsized given our population. If these tariffs persist, the impact will be visible in CO2 charts. ",appleandorangutan,2025-04-30T21:21:24,-4
"Well, yes, but one step at a time, starting with fixing the clusterfuck that he created with his moronic trade policies and actions.",tjk45268,2025-05-01T01:08:18,1
Well said.   All the red warning lights are flashing madly. Trump is on a mission to destroy America. He cannot be allowed to continue down this disastrously insane road.,crazybones,2025-05-01T06:13:50,1
