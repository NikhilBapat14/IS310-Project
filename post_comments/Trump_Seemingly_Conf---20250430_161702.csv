"I think I have written this already but let me give my humble opinion as an European.  Trump is not the cause. Trump is the symptom of something utterly broken in the USA.  The fact that millions of Americans are able to vote, confidently, to a corrupted convicted felon with no morals and absolute disregard for human life is the cause.  I come from a country where corruption is above the median on the EU. But even here, and that is saying a lot, people wouldn‚Äôt vote for such an idiot.  And in the remote scenario that they voted for him, if he /she pulled out the things he has during his 100 days of presidency, he would have been impeached.  Our political system is composed of many parties and some of them are key to provide governability to the country (what you call the senate and parliament) and his/her allies would have retired their support pronto.  It also helps that here the president does not hold as much power as in the USA. He can‚Äôt pull that much shit.  Socially speaking, as much as you Americans like to tell yourselves the tale that you come together in times of need, what we have seen when things go south amongst yourselves is that you turn, as a society, into a mob of paranoid a******s. Here in Europe things are different, people ACTUALLY come together.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong we have a shitload of flaws here in Europe but in America, you have to add up to the same flaws: lack of affordable healthcare, lack of unemployment protection, weapons, a paranoid induced media, highly uneducated population (in certain aspects), obsession with money, and, sorry to say, selfishness.   You are a ticking bomb.  I used to love the USA and what it meant but truth to be told even though you consider yourselves the greatest and freest country on earth, you are not. There are probably close to 100 countries where life is better.   Sure, you have a lot of immigrants, those who are desperate, but those who are not (which are more and more by the day as human development has skyrocketed through all the world on the last decades) will never consider going to the USA.

"That'll be RFK's contribution to the conversation. Trump will tell us about sales. A lot of people don't know this, but grocery stores sometimes put things on sale. That means they sell them for less than the regular price. I've been talking to a lot of grocery store chains and they say that this is something that they're going to do. They didn't used to do this, but they're going to do this now. Each week, they'll put out a piece of paper, it's called an ad. And in this ad, there are different things that are on sale. So if you want to save money, you can get one of these ads and see what's on sale, and then buy things cheaper. Sleepy Joe didn't do anything like this. This is going to completely change the way people buy groceries and you're going to get amazing deals. The best deals.",DrocketX,2025-04-30T20:48:35,8

Edit: also worth saying that this idea he's saying, just buy less, seems completely disconnected to the fact that doing so (and his tarrifs in general) is about to cause a ton of people to lose employment.
