"This macho coward bans people who have taken an oath to serve their country.  I have the greatest respect for anyone, I don’t give a shit if they are gay, trans, etc. who voluntarily join the armed forces.  God bless all of them.",sullyball008,2025-05-06T18:22:44,1

"Depends on how much medical care they need.  I’m all for trans rights, but there is an expectation of readiness for deployment.  If someone is undergoing operations that make them unable to deploy or are requiring special medications during deployments then it causes issues.  I’ve seen people removed because they found out they were diabetic at age 19, pregnancies cause issues and remove people from rotations. If you go into the military and then start requiring additional/special medical attention then you shouldn’t be in, that’s just the reality of things.",SeaSea4437,2025-05-06T15:00:00,-6

I’d love to point out that being trans doesn’t mean you’re required to get gender reassignment surgery. I know multiple trans people with little to no surgery.,ACasualRead,2025-05-06T15:26:02,14
"I know someone who was rejected during basic for having poorly controlled asthma. The bar is pretty low for medical conditions that can disqualify — needing special medication that only a small minority of service members require is undeniably a logistical burden.   But also, fuck Trump, this wasn’t a real issue causing real day-to-day problems; it’s just red meat for the Fox News crowd.",Begging_Murphy,2025-05-06T15:11:01,4
"The original order had some bs about truthfulness and good discipline and that preferred pronouns are not compatible with a strong military. If Trump wanted to exclude those requiring ongoing medical care or with legitimate concerns about mental health or its treatment, it would have legitimacy as an argument. A person who has a male body and has had no medical treatment and has no medical needs and simply says they’d like to be called she/her or grow out their hair is included in this order. That shows it’s based on intolerance and exclusion rather than fitness or burdening the military.",UnionizedTrouble,2025-05-06T16:02:52,4
"> that’s just the reality of things.  No, the reality of things is that they would love to go after LGBT but the people seem to have accepted that gays have same rights as hetero so they go after low hanging fruits, the transgenders...",Agnos,2025-05-06T15:12:22,6
"you know damn well Tricare is Not going to give anyone bottom surgery, or fucking top surgery for that matter.  they want us dead, and delegitimized. So trans service members must be eliminated, because it goes against the narrative that we are drains on society.  anyone that has a problem with a trans service member in their unit can fucking enjoy a special soap party.   just like i did to the fuckers in sonar after i was allowed to be openly gay",SpaceTranshipYamato,2025-05-06T15:47:39,2
