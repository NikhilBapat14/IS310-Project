"The monarch and their immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to functions such as bestowing honors and appointing the prime minister, which are performed in a non-partisan manner. The monarch is also able to advise, generally done in secret, to change draft laws. The monarch is also Head of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate executive authority over the government is still formally by and through the royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent. The Government of the United Kingdom is known as His Majesty's Government.     That's the VERY basics.",plasteredjedi,2022-09-12T12:08:58,48
"In many countries, there is a constitutional division of labour between the head of state and the head of government. The head of state is the formal representative of the country, and often has various (but not overwhelming) constitutional responsibilities with regards to forming and dissolving governments. In countries like Germany or Ireland, the head of state is a president; in constitutional monarchies like the UK, the head of state is a king or queen, and performs similar duties. In the US, the president wears both of these hats; he or she is the ceremonial leader, but also conducts all of the actual business of running the country.  In the UK, the sovereign 'invites' a prospective PM to form the government. They dispense titles and honours (on the recommendation of the government), represent the country abroad, etc. It is a very limited portfolio in practice, as overstepping perceived traditional and constitutional bounds might speed the monarchy to extinction. Other heads of state (consider the Italian president, for example) are often more aggressive in wielding their similarly limited authority.  Not all constitutional monarchies are as limiting on the monarch as the UK; Jordan and Morocco (and Monaco) are all constitutional monarchies where the king (or prince) wields tremendous executive power.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-09-12T12:30:44,14
"The King or Queen of the \*United Kingdom\* (and some Commonwealth countries) both has technically still a lot of power and also constitutionally devolved a lot of power.   That's all to say that over time, through a number of agreements and tradition, the monarch has gone from having almost all the power to turning over a lot of the actual governing decision making to elected officials. That means officially, even a lot of the governing authority of elected officials is technically by authority of the monarch. While in some of these, the monarchy could theoretically exercise a lot more of their power, the monarchy has now traditionally worked hard to maintain an apolitical position and any violation of that would likely lead to more trouble for them - because after all, while they may technically hold all of the power, that power only works if your constituents or subjects believe in it.   So does the King (or Queen) have a lot of real authority? Absolutely. But functionally, for them to exercise it unilaterally at this point would be suicide.   So what do they do - they fulfill the Head of State role in large part. That's not consistent (sometimes it's a more functionally powerful role and sometimes it's not and sometimes, like in the US, it's the same person). But the Monarch is basically the face of the country - they perform ceremonial and diplomatic duties while the Head of Government (in the UK, that's the Prime Minister) performs more of the governing authorities related to policy and legislation etc. In the context of the UK, this involves doing a lot of ceremonial functions of governance, (e.g. opening Parliament, ribbon cuttings, addressing the public, attending public events, ribbon cuttings etc, receiving foreign visiting leaders, going on foreign trips, etc.). In theory, this leaves a lot of the time for governance etc to the Head of Government.  In theory, their role is to be the face of the country internally as well - so while Parliament and the Prime Minister may shift, the country still has a consistent ceremonial leader.",PhiloPhocion,2022-09-12T13:27:09,6
"Hi MrKrabbs  The British monarchy is a constitutional monarchy, which means the king doesn't excerise any formal political power. As head of state, their job is to act as an apolitical representative of their various kingdoms, proactively remaining out of political issues.  While this is not necessarily the most active political duty, it is nonetheless an important one. This status as an apolitical head of state enforces a separation between the nation and its political government. This provides an outlet for peoples' patriotic and even jingoistic sentiment that can't be hijacked for political ends, and ensures no politician can claim to solely speak for the nation as a way of demonising their opponents. Those sentiments are inevitable, so finding a way they can be expressed and focused apolitically is a useful way of negating their more negative effects.  For example, in the United States, where political office and head of state are very closely integrated in the presidency, you often seen incumbent presidents use the ceremony surrounding their office (hail to the chief, air force one etc) as a tool on the campaign trail to suggest, to varying degrees of subtlety, that voting for their political agenda is not just the right thing to do, but the only *American* thing to do as a patriotic voter. More seriously, you find the idea in some presidents (most notably Nixon, trump, and Bush) that because of their status as the embodiment of the nation with a democratic mandate 'if the president does it, that makes it legal'. Regardless of whether that is found to be true in practice, the belief that's they have such a mandate leads them to do horrific things like Watergate or Torture Black Sites.  Those are extreme illustrations, obviously, but they also show the downside of having such a politicised and  integrated head of state. By keeping the role ceremonial and without an independent political mandate, Britain firmly separates the two and avoids the possibility of blurring such boundaries between the two roles. The Prime Minister can never claim to embody the nation, and the king can't claim any legitimacy to act politically  Sorry that was a bit rambling, but hopefully you get the idea. Here's [George Orwell ](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CgkKTzBWYAAmfZW.jpg:large) to put it better than I can.  Have a wonderful day",Corvid187,2022-09-12T13:06:26,5
"Over the years, the monarchy in the UK has been reformed to have less and less actual power. Back in the early years of England as a country, the monarch was probably something somewhat similar to what you see in medieval fantasy shows (sort of...most of these shows don't have a good concept of legitimacy, and so the king often wields far more power without fear of rebellion than would ever be realistic, but the point is it's close enough). But as the UK has become more and more of a democracy, it has taken power that used to reside in the monarch and placed it in other institutions instead.  Most of the remaining ""powers"" of the monarch are largely ceremonial or only serve to reinforce democratically arrived outcomes. For example, the monarch will ""confirm"" the PM and the PM isn't actually technically in power until the monarch has done their part. Ostensibly, that gives the monarch the power to decline to confirm, but that's never been done in modern times and would basically trigger a constitutional crisis if it ever were to occur.   The monarch is also the commander in chief of the armed forces...but practically that means little, as the armed forces would be making most of those decisions and even the higher level stuff is not being decided unilaterally by the monarch. Parliament would have a huge amount of influence over any decisions.  The monarch is also the nominal head of state, but since the monarch doesn't really determine policy, that's more of a nominal role than anything else and most of the actual foreign policy would be handled by the PM and Ministers.   So overall, the monarch does have actual duties and roles, but they have little ability to actually make decisions. For the most part, the monarch is executing the democratically determined will of the people.",mormagils,2022-09-12T12:26:53,6
"For the most part she’s a formality on passing laws - she signs them into law with her ‘royal assent’, which in practice just means she rubber-stamps what the Government have voted to make a law.

"In theory the monarch has a lot of power. Some of the comments here do a good job but one power they have is veto power of parliamentary bills, as in the final say kind of a veto.

"It's a minor pedantic point, but it should be ""King/Queen of the UK"" (or the UK's long form) rather than ""King/Queen of England"".   England and Scotland merged in 1707 to form the kingdom of Great Britain, which then merged with Ireland in 1801 to form the UK. There hasn't actually been a ""King of England"" or ""Queen of England"" for more than 300 years now!   Saying ""Queen of England"" is a bit like saying Biden is the ""President of Texas"". He's president of the thing containing Texas, but doesn't have that title.  It's interesting how common the phrase ""Queen of England"" seems to be in some places though, despite that. It seems particularly common in the US, which is odd because the last King or Queen of England was a long time before America got its independence.",Anaptyso,2022-09-13T04:34:01,1
"In addition to what everyone has already stated, the monarch is head of state for over a dozen countries, which gives them quite a lot of power; for example, they sacked Australia's government in 1975, via a governor general (the queen's executive delegate to a Commonwealth nation). The King is also head of Canada's military, etc.",overzealous_dentist,2022-09-13T08:41:35,1
"Well, the good ones invade France.  The lesser ones? Mostly just act as props for the nation. They are the Head of State (as opposed to Head of Government), so they're the folks who have to gladhand all the high muckety-mucks and put on a show that makes their nation look good.  You know how pundits go on about how a President needs to be a ""guy you would want to have a beer with?"". In the U.S., the ideal President needs to be both likable and competent. In the U.K., the Prime Minister is the one who needs to be competent while the monarch needs to be likable (albeit not in the have-a-beer-with sense). This allows you to have absolutely toxic individuals who can get the job done (think Churchill) and amiable dunces (think Princess Di) in the same government, each acting within their specialty.",ViskerRatio,2022-09-13T10:59:35,1
