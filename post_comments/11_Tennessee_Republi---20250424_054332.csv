"White babies! We must have more white babies because Jesus wants us to have a ""quiverfull"" of them until our bodies literally wear out. Hard to believe this is the 21st Century and not the Middle Ages. Here's  a thought, if you want women to stay home to be baby-making machines, how about paying them to do it?",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T06:34:28,10

Paying women to have sex? That's illegal!,frigatesspc,2025-04-24T06:41:50,3
">how about paying them to do it?  Sure! If the government provides me 500k per child over an 18yr period and an additional 150k per year to account for all the unpaid labor SAHPs perform to compensate for the base financials. I will also require free health, vision, and dental insurance for all family members and a housing allowance corresponding to the number of dependents in my household. Oh, and don't forget all my tax breaks.  Once I get that, I'll have as many kids the govt wants me to have 🤷🏼‍♀️",Tired-and-Wired,2025-04-24T09:20:49,3
