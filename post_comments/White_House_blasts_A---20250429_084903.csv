Transparency and truth is frowned upon by this corrupt administration.,Busy-Difficulty-4757,2025-04-29T09:04:39,40
I hate that I like something Amazon is doing. I hope this helps more people realize what's happening and how they are being screwed over by moronic policies.,Ponkaroni,2025-04-29T09:44:24,27
"Facts are ""hostile and political"".  Trump's White House are trying to hide the damage that tariffs are causing.  > ...Amazon will soon show consumers how much of an item’s cost comes from tariffs. >  > The amount added as a result of tariffs will be displayed right next to each product’s total listed price, a person familiar with the plan told the news outlet. >  > A reporter in Tuesday’s press briefing asked Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent if they agreed that Amazon’s move is a “crystal clear demonstration that it’s the American consumer, and not China, who is going to have to pay for these policies.”",progress18,2025-04-29T08:49:37,24
I propose a symbol on each item like an emoji.  It is of a leopard eating someone's face.  and the percentage of the price that is tariff based is the percentage of the symbol you can see.,One_Abalone1135,2025-04-29T09:33:37,11
Mark my words: they're going to start using the H1B program as a weapon.  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if we started reading headlines about employees at Amazon having their visas revoked without warning in the coming weeks.,lordorwell7,2025-04-29T09:58:40,8
That’s called transparency. I hope other companies follow suit.,mlineras,2025-04-29T09:58:19,7

"how's showing $0.00 on American made products hostile ? Showing tariffs next to the price tag tells us which countries are robbing us jobs. External Revenue Service is happening as the president said on TRUTH Social, and we want truth! /s",erichang,2025-04-29T10:02:20,3

Bezos has no courage and will back off of this when Trump pressures him,Bakingsquared80,2025-04-29T11:35:24,2
This doesn’t even make sense. If the whole point of tariffs was to get people to “buy American” made products isn’t this how they would do it ?? It’s almost like it has nothing to do with that.  Let’s see if our genius media asks the question…… I doubt it. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-29T12:03:30,2
Amazon already caved. Boycott back on boys.,Joshhwwaaaaaa,2025-04-29T12:28:54,2
So people will just not wonder why prices increase and product availability becomes limited?   I am sure the white house will feed some propaganda to distract the morons that support them.,Mr-Hoek,2025-04-29T14:08:14,2
Trump said the country shipping product paid the tariffs. Why the sudden urge to keep this “fact” from American consumers?,AncientScratch1670,2025-04-29T10:56:17,1
"I mean, the fact is, aren't they going to have to do some sort of cost breakdown at some point? They can't leave prices as they are, but people who aren't keeping up with this are going to wonder why prices are rising",Rosebunse,2025-04-29T13:15:40,1
I think Amazon and other sellers have a duty and responsibility to reveal and display any and all tariff fees in the transaction.,crashnburner,2025-04-29T15:47:14,1

How much was taxes has been on literally every receipt I have ever seen. Now suddenly it is an attack on Trump for his genius policies?,Sir_Penguin21,2025-04-29T12:31:17,3

Not taxes. A line item that specifically calls out the additional costs due to stupid tariffs.  https://preview.redd.it/kyoa41g08txe1.jpeg?width=552&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1d863fffad879ff393c89e18964cbd41eebb223,Busy-Difficulty-4757,2025-04-29T12:34:30,1
"Because he didn't do it by enough to make it worth the effort to recode their backend to include a whole new line item.   If he did it at all, which I can't seem to find any evidence of, so this is probably another one of those Fox News Cinematic Universe things that never happened, like the kids using litter boxes.",Facehugger_35,2025-04-29T17:06:52,1
