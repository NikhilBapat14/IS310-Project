"> The Justice Department has rescinded a policy implemented during the Biden administration that restricted prosecutors from seizing reporters' records in criminal investigations  Gee, I wonder why the Felon-in-Chief might want to do that.",DaveChild,2025-04-28T04:02:58,15
Imagine my surprise ….  What an odious and feckless cabal of corruption that now rules fascist America.   So very sad.,Spanky3703,2025-04-28T07:47:20,4
"The protections were originally implemented **""after the department** \[Biden's DOJ\] **disclosed several instances during the previous Trump administration where prosecutors secretly obtained records from several journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN as part of criminal leak investigations.""**  This is an attack on one of the main pillars of the constitution. Also a travesty of ""justice"" that trump's goons are going after the messenger, instead of investigating the trump admin's illegal release of classified information: Giving [Pentagon war plans](https://archive.ph/0cvkT) to [an espionage agent of China](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/404621/elon-musk-china-tesla-trump), and divulging [classified details over unsecured apps](https://archive.ph/eUO3U).  If rank and file government employees did this they'd be in jail for years, at minimum. trump's Department of Lawfare is instead focused on silencing and punishing whistleblowers and the free press, again.",charcoalist,2025-04-28T09:32:24,1
They were never very concerned about protecting journalists in Gaza (Israel has killed about 200). Whats the IDF does in Palestine sort of sets the standard for what’s permissible by US security forces.,80sLegoDystopia,2025-04-28T09:14:15,0
