"They're not deportees if they haven't been granted due process.  They're kidnapees.    Let's call it what it is, shall we?",Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-04T08:31:39,47
"Of course they do, they got ¬£290 million from the UK Conservatives from a similar scheme, that never managed to deport anyone due to legal challenges. I think 4 people went voluntarily.

"Rishi Sunak‚Äôs UK government spent ¬£500 million planning and organising the dispatch of illegal immigrants to Rwanda, so I presume there is now some infrastructure created in the country.

"[Archive link](https://archive.ph/aArwN)  >A recent U.S. overture, which included a list of names of potential deportees to Rwanda, was received warmly, according to a Rwandan official with knowledge of the situation. Under the proposal, Rwanda would join a growing number of nations ‚Äî including El Salvador, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama ‚Äî that have agreed to receive deportees who are not their citizens.  Mind you this comes just as WaPo reports that a lot of the deportees to El Salvador were actually in the country legally and were complying with immigration rules.",Infidel8,2025-05-04T08:24:24,7
"Of course they did.  They received ¬£290 million in direct payments from the UK government in return for accepting *one* deportee, who himself had been paid ¬£3000 to go.  https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/world/europe/uk-rwanda-deportation-plan.html  I have no doubt Rwanda is being very friendly.

I don't think this has anything to do with immigrants per se. I think it has to do with setting the stage for the regime rounding up and deporting black people....,codename_pariah,2025-05-04T09:09:48,2

I do not know why Rwanda wants to be an international prison camp. Just seems like there are better things it could be doing.,KeyInvestigator3741,2025-05-04T11:44:19,1
"is there any data on a total cost per deportee, or is that number still too unclear?  is US paying Rwanda $100,000 per deportee?  what is the average collection and transportation cost?  another $25,000?",RAdm_Teabag,2025-05-04T08:54:24,0
"I also don't think they fit the definition of deportee if they aren't citizens of the country you're sending them too.   What's to stop that country from just shipping them to an uninhabited island or more likely ""we don't know where that person went, they weren't a citizen ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"". Meaning they're being sent to death or slave camps.  Hell at this point trump could fix relations with China if he said ""look, treat the Uyghurs nice and we'll send you as many 'gang members' as you need to build iPhones""",scubahood86,2025-05-04T08:57:13,9

"""a lot of the deportees to El Salvador were actually in the country legally and were complying with immigration rules""   they were easy to catch because they weren't hiding. they voted for trump because they thought they were 'the good ones because they weren't hiding/ the gang members and rapists are all still in the US because they don't know who or where they are",JaVelin-X-,2025-05-04T08:27:15,1
If their idea here is that they would have the same sort of scheme as they had with the UK it was not intended that the people sent there would stay in prison. The plan was that people would be given refugee status and given funds to help them settle.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda_asylum_plan#Rwanda,La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-04T13:27:00,1
