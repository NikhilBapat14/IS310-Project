"From Bloomberg News reporter [Billy House](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASGMzIlI8Os/billy-house):  Boos, shouts and insults dominated New York Representative Mike Lawler’s rowdy town hall on Sunday as the GOP lawmaker’s constituents seethed over President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress.  “Folks, if you want me to answer the questions, let the question be asked, then listen to the answer,” Lawler pleaded as some of the 700 people who were packed into a West Nyack high school ridiculed him for describing himself as a moderate.  Meetings with constituents have emerged as flashpoints for grass-roots anger over Trump’s controversial policies, including his trade war and mass federal firings promoted by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.  House Republican leaders have advised their members not to schedule town halls in order to avoid such spectacles.",bloomberg,2025-04-28T07:48:34,13
"Lawler very well may have lost in 2024, given his district went for Harris. Too bad his opposition was a feckless Mondaire Jones.",Greedy_Switch_6991,2025-04-28T08:02:17,4

Fox News will spin it that it was taken over by 'paid actor' Democrats who just wanted to make a scene.   Everyone is mad that Republicans (and Democrats to some extent although they don't have much say without holding majority) are feckless and planning to cut Medicare and Medicaid on top of allowing this administration to be lawless authoritarians with no checks and balances.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T08:07:04,6
Yes the GOP advising representatives to stop listening to their constituents to suppress legitimate concern and criticisms of them not actually representing anyone at all.,beadzy,2025-04-28T09:36:17,1
