"From reporter Marita Vlachou:  As Tuesday marks President Donald Trump’s 100th day in office, having signed a dizzying number of 142 executive orders, one thing is clear: the chaos his second term in office has unleashed on the country, including on the U.S. economy, is turning off voters, according to the polls.  Trump’s reelection in November seems to have emboldened him following his 2020 defeat, which he has yet to accept.
