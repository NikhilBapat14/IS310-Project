I continue to have arguments here with people who don't realize that we've been taken over by fascists. Just today somebody in this very subreddit was insisting that while Trump is a fascist our _government_ is not fascist.   But the thing is that Trump and his minions have only been in power for 100 days. It took Hitler about a year to completely weaponize the German government In 1933. But Trump is making very good progress.   This attack on Harvard is exactly what fascists do. They weaponize parts of the government that are supposed to benefit society and instead use them simply to attack their political enemies.    It's just incredible to me that there are so many people on Reddit who don't understand and that we've had fascist takeover.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T19:26:07,12
Someone can't stand a certain former president was the editor in chief so things got personal from there.,thieh,2025-04-28T19:11:17,10
Obama was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. Obviously an under qualified DEI appointment and therefore a discriminatory hire. So goes the Trump logic.,Slack_Jaw_Yokel,2025-04-28T20:37:58,5

"I imagine a lot of context is missing here. One of the complaints was that an article was given an expedited review so it could get to print faster because it was written by a minority. I can almost guarantee this article was about something related to the author's minority background, thus they thought the author's unique viewpoint would be an asset.",Lindy2026,2025-04-28T19:21:52,0
