One day Trump is going to die and no one of any importance is going to show up to his funeral,Rosebunse,2025-05-06T20:50:59,5
"Though this is a ceremony hosted by a nonprofit, several European countries threatened to boycott if Russia was invited. Russia and Belarus were invited, and an email sent telling the European embassies they were now no longer invited.  Now the ceremony  is much smaller, and focused only on Americans who died fighting  in WW II. Guess it’s clear what the current administration the White House wanted. Trump is in love with Putin and hates our European allies. He also called our military “ suckers and losers” and managed to avoid the draft during the Vietnam War after getting a doctor’s note saying he has bone spurs. Odd how Trump never appeared to have any problem walking ever until he was much older.",EmberVioletta,2025-05-06T19:24:31,5
