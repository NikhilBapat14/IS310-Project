Sending Stephen Miran to try and calm big Wall Street financial types?  That's like sending Krusty the Clown into an emergency room operating theater.,CockBrother,2025-04-30T07:50:44,2
"It seems like as a nation, we're in this lull period between cancelling all our monthly bill payments online and the due date for those coming up. The water, heat, gas, electric, internet, smartphone all still work, but there'll be a cutoff of service that's going to be abrupt and devastating when the disconnect becomes real.   The United States has done this with products from China, and has signaled to trade partners that we're not interested in further business with them. They'll shut down the flow as directed by Trump tariffs and the lack of orders, and the disconnect date when it arrives will not be pleasant. Further, it will be extremely expensive to reconnect, with full rates and a reconnect fee for each one, with no discounts or previous rates.",localistand,2025-04-30T07:47:24,3
