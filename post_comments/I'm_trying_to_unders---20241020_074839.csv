"In terms of facts, the first place to start is to go to the Secretary of State's office for your state, which is here:  https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/petitions/2024BallotMeasures  which has a link to read the actual full text of the proposed ballot measures, which, as with most ballot measures, is only a page or two of text.  So you can read it pretty fast.  I don't see anything that would obviously relate to trans issues.  at some point though it's hard for anyone to give you a definite answer without being a trained lawyer of that state.  I'd guess it could allow potentially allow an abortion up to 7 months/~32 weeks, which is iirc the margin at which a fetus can plausibly survive birth without major medical intervention/modern medicine, but you'd need to check those stats as my memory is vague and from long ago.  But that could vary based on how that clause is interpreted for what counts as extraordinary intervention.  It does explicitly say an abortion at any point can be done if needed to protect the life/health of the mother.",zlefin_actual,2024-10-23T14:25:27,1
