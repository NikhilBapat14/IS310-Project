"That's not the first time he's done that.   He has opening endorsed getting rid of it on more than one occasion.  And the fact is, his supporters are fine with that.  I know; I'm surrounded by them.",tinyE1138,2025-05-04T12:24:10,13

This piece of dog shit can say shit like this daily and they shrug their goddamn shoulders and at most say ""that's just how trump is"" and his scumbags defending him will say hes ""trolling the media"" or ""Well what he really meant was this! The media is twisting his words!"" What a fucking joke",FickleSystem,2025-05-04T13:44:17,8

"Why wouldn't he, he does not know nor comprehend what grace and reconciliation is.   We all know that he absolutely got absolutely shut down at Washington National Cathedral and for recently creating that AI-fueled deepfake of himself in Papal raiment.
