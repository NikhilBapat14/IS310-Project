They didn’t realize the adults left the room during the first administration?  Finally getting a clue?,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T20:17:24,19
"Exciting? 42%, seriously? What does that even mean, anyway. Is that a positive thing in these people’s minds???? This is just a fucking joke to them.",Podwitchers,2025-04-25T20:22:00,16
I do not care about the allowed answers: how many people polled noted that the fascist regime is a fascist regime?,Still_Mix3277,2025-04-25T20:14:56,3
"If overreaching now means a fascist dictatorship, then the voters are correct.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-25T20:36:45,3
They're still waiting for someone else to save them.,putin_my_ass,2025-04-25T21:54:42,3
"If people keep doing nothing, it doesn’t matter. Stop this regime now. The damage is is already irreparable. Soon it’s going to just be a massacre",NovaGuardBeck,2025-04-26T01:12:01,2
Overreaching? Seriously? Talk about understatement of the century. The sob offered VIP visits to the White House for top trump coin holders (how in the fuck he was allowed to start this latest grift is beyond me). We’re way past overreaching at this point. I’m absolutely awestruck this level of corruption goes unchecked.,Top-Work-4425,2025-04-26T01:26:58,1

He literally said he was going to be a dictator on day one. Who could’ve seen this coming? /s,PatrolPunk,2025-04-26T08:28:43,1
42% described it as exciting... just wait until it affects them directly. Fucking ignorant idiots. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-26T17:10:46,1
"Maybe they meant exciting in the way the people insult others by saying 'may you live in interesting times'.   Like it is exciting, in a terrifying and scary sort of way.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-25T21:37:18,7
"I’m going to be charitable and assume they’re saying exciting in the same way that awesome doesn’t necessarily have to mean “something good” and instead could mean “something inspiring of awe”  In which case, I would indeed call the current fascist regime “awesome”",Vicky_Roses,2025-04-25T23:01:14,1
