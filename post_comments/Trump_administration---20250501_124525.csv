How else can we pay all the amazing government officials who do such a wonderful job for America!,Formal-Row2853,2025-05-02T03:49:34,0
Because they care more about DEI.  I’m sure some of the $$ was being spent on mental health services for kids who struggling with their sexuality and gender identity.  It often causes a lot of depression and anxiety and other mental health issues as kids grapple with it.,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-01T16:04:06,1
