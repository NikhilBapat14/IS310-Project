"Republicans exclusively focus on issues that are high salience for them. Immigration, crime, inflation, transgender athletes, etc. Republicans straight up refuse to engage in discussions about anything that isn't good for their bucket of hot comebacks.   Ask a Republican question about healthcare and the answer will be ""what's bad for the health of average Americans is being murdered by an illegal immigrant"". Try to follow up and get a real answer on healthcare and they just say ""Why are you trying to deny that we have an immigration crisis"".   Democrats must stop conceding to that stone walling strategy. If Republicans talk about Transgender athletes and then get Democrats responding and talking about it too what the public sees are two political parties debating transgender athletics and no one talking about Education, Housing, minimum wage, etc.   There are only so many hours in a day and Republicans are using those hours to beat the drums on immigration and Transgender athletes. Democrats should NOT waste one minute of that stuff. Democrats need to beat the drums on Healthcare costs and minimum wage. Give the people a clear distinction between parties.  The future of the Democratic Party will be the person who can talk about policy without getting sucked into high salience Rightwing to talk points.",8to24,2025-03-07T06:04:40,106
"Andy beshear is a democratic governor of Kentucky, his vote share increased with his time in office.   He’s doing something right to appeal to that demographic. I’ve only heard him speak a little but he seems to have charisma too. I think the dems best odds are someone who can play to middle America.  Walz was a good example, but it’s hard to tell whether his niceness would be an advantage or disadvantage in a race.",Xanto97,2025-03-06T23:29:09,85

"Something both Clinton and Obama had in common is that they were top tier charismatic orators. By this logic Shapiro should be at the top of the list for 2028, but I feel many will think he sounds *too* much like Obama in his speaking style, to the extent where he’s viewed as a cheap imitation. He also has issues ranging from past controversies (Vereb and Greenberg) to centrist takes that could be problems with the base such as on Israel and school vouchers.  After that, Warnock checks of the “solid orator” box as a black pastor; those guys know how to work a crowd. He may be too valuable to move from his senate seat though, especially if Georgia doesn’t get a Democratic governor soon.  JB Pritzker is also a name to watch - he’s making a name for himself loudly opposing Trump and would be acceptable to both the establishment and progressives as the nominee. Finally I’ll mention Chris Murphy, one of the few people talking about long term problems beyond the next election cycle - although his background that of just another career politician.",Jokerang,2025-03-06T21:26:33,100
"We need someone who has rizz, real energy, and who can be mean when necessary. No more being soy or being afraid of stepping on some purity test minefield. The candidate should be able to address all groups of people with specific messages on how the Democratic Party recognizes their problems, including men (especially white men)  Forgot to add this and Reddit will not like this, but the candidate also has to be able to buck ultra leftists who hate the Dem party, purity test around everything, and are about as far removed from the average voter that you can possibly be.

"Watching from Canada, it seems to me the candidates are sometimes weak but more so, and this is for the gop and the democrats, the VP candidates are somewhat weak.   Governor Waltz was really good however I think Mark Kelly would have been a better option for Kamala. Kamala herself I think was a weak option for VP.  For Hillary Clinton I think she should have put aside her grudge with Bernie Sanders and welcomed him as her VP. She might have had to reign him in a bit but it would have held a lot of water with those supporting him and the progressives which too often get overlooked.  Buttigieg is an eloquent genius and I've rarely seen anyone as sharp as a speaker as he. He excels over almost every person. But if a woman has a difficult time getting elected as President in America, what about a gay man for President? Regardless of how solid candidates they are.  I know little of the others except for AOC whom is a strong individual that I think would be better representing the American people elsewhere for now.  Something I believe is important for the Democratic party is that people like Pelosi and Debbie-Wasserman-schultz and Donna Brazile should not be in leading positions in determining too much in the Democrat party any longer.",xtothewhy,2025-03-06T23:46:28,33
"Look at the pool of democratic governors from Midwestern or swing states. They are far more likely to have sensible positions on cultural issues, yet also be warriors for the working and middle class, because they have to actually manage a state government. Plus, if they had to win a tight race in a swing state, they can't talk in platitudes, adopt radical positions, or get nothing done. And, having been the top executive in a state helps voters see that person as a potential executive at the national level.  So, that means Shapiro, Whitmer, Besher, Polis, or Moore.  AOC can be a very effective messenger, but I don't see the country viewing her as Presidential material, Buttigieg is good in an interview or debate, but his resume is weak, and Warnock doesn't have much of anything to show for his tenure so far. Meanwhile, I've seen people mention Ro Khanna but I just don't see it at all. He has no gravitas, whereas Fetterman is just too odd and polarizing. Meanwhile, I'd omit Newsom because I just don't see the country voting for a democrat from California as they'll view him as the poster child of government inefficiency and waste. It's just way to easy to run against someone like that in the general election.  Outside of this group of Governors, I'd keep an eye on people like Cory Booker or maybe Chris Murphy as they are probably the best bets from the Senate.  Finally, if it's going to be someone from outside politics, it would need to be someone with major star power, and no, Stephen A Smith or The Rock don't qualify. Even someone like John Stewart would be a long-shot at best and I think he has enough respect for the office that he wouldn't presume to be qualified anyway. It would have to be someone like Oprah who is not only hugely famous and beloved, but someone who built and sustained a successful business and can therefore be seen as an executive and not just a commentator.",ATLCoyote,2025-03-07T08:41:54,6

"It’s hopeless and here is why.  Democrats are too honest and too practical.  We are not willing to call out unachievable grandiose promises to get that next voter.  Voters want the economy to improve for them which means growing the middle class, but the middle class shrink is irreversible.  The wealth is now so concentrated in a few people it reduces economic activity.  Unions are completely crippled and people are not smart enough to understand the importance of unions in getting middle class pay.  Automation and offshoring has reduced the potential for middle class jobs.  Trump is especially good at promising a brighter future.  Democrats are bad at it and the best they do is promise things that sound like government handouts and those things fall completely flat on even those who would benefit.  People seem to want the promise of a brighter future even when the candidate has no plans to get there for most people.  It’s charisma and communication.  Reagan had it, Clinton had it, Obama had it, and sadly it seems Trump has it.  The party who has the charisma wins.  Right now, I’d say out of the entire group, it might be Shapiro or Warnock.",Reasonable-Sawdust,2025-03-07T11:14:59,4
"I don't really think this discussion is helpful at this point. Not only is it too early but the current leadership (notably Hakeem Jeffries) has already shown their current strategy is extremely out-of-touch with what the voters are begging for.

"Trump appeals to the average American because of his unconventional style and the fact that he provides simple (though wildly incorrect) solutions to working class issues. Can’t find a job? Outsourcing sent it overseas and immigrants took what’s left! Grocery prices too high? Too much government regulation! Wages too low? Taxes are too high! It plays well with his base, but it extends to average Americans too because Trump and his party control the narrative.  Democrats need a clear, bold vision with concise, simple messaging. And they likely need a brash, unconventional speaker to lead the charge on the campaign trail. If Democrats en masse TOMORROW endorse Medicare For All, public financing of elections, and/or the Green New Deal, or something along those lines, and they actually fought tooth and nail to make the pitch to the American people about how that would HELP them, I do believe it’d make them a force to be reckoned with.  But as it is, Democrats roll over to big donors and risky positions at fear of losing their power. But as a result, they’re fickle and flaky. And those aforementioned policies, without any champions, die in the wake of Republican attacks, causing those proposals to become unpopular. If Democrats find their new, younger Bernie Sanders, I guarantee you’ll have the party of the future. As it stands, I don’t think that candidate exists yet. They’re certainly not on that list, except AOC possibly (but she’s probably not experienced enough yet imo).",yoshi8869,2025-03-07T07:32:00,2
"I would add Andy Beashear, Governor of Kentucky. He won his first term by a thread thanks to his opponent being a total dipshit (and lesson in that being Trumpy only works if you are Trump), then won his second term by a wider margin by campaigning on an openly pro-choice platform in a ruby red state. Even if he is not top of the ticket, he would be one they could send to red states and cause mischief.   A non-politician would be Mark Cuban. He's rich, he's got celebrity, and can be in people's faces similar to Trump. Big difference is he's not a wannabe dictator. And if shaking the DNC up is what people want, and TBH it is probably long past time, Cuban would be the one who could do it.",DenseYear2713,2025-03-07T10:44:58,2

Biden's debate performance. Biden stepping down too late. Harris being nominated with no primary. Harris's complete failure of a campaign. Biden doing nothing to prepare for Trump. The party doing nothing to stop Trump the last 2.5 months.  I know people who were ride-or-die for Biden and Harris, and even they're fed up.  If Trump (somehow) runs in 2028, unless something radically shifts, I don't think the Democrats can beat him.

"I'm a huge Whitmer fan as my governor, but personally I think the best person would be an economic populist somewhat in the mold of Sanders, and possibly from outside of politics like Trump was. Unfortunately such a candidate would probably have a rough time of the primaries, and would also still face a congress and scotus stacked against them when it comes time to deliver on any real radical change- but I do think that's what people want, especially young voters- they are fed up with both parties, and especially with congressional gridlock and performative politics. Any dem president has a huge hurdle getting agendas into law due to the slowly growing imabalance of representation due to gerrymandering, shifting populations of states and districts, voter disenfranchisement, etc. Some major reforms are needed just to rebalance the playing field before there is even a chance to push any progressive policy agenda.",peetnice,2025-03-07T00:41:09,1

"Well, as we've seen twice now, for some reason a woman cannot be the POTUS.  Their own party won't even vote for them, and we *know* Republicans only view women as eye candy at best.  So as much as I think AOC is the absolute closest we'd ever get to a POTUS who actually IS ""one of us"", she'd never win the election.  Pete *should be* a shoe in.  He's got literally everything you want in a POTUS.  Smart, speaks several languages, understands politics and the process, talks to his constituents frequently, is into the arts (plays a few different instruments).  But he's Catholic and he's gay.  The former is something republicans hate as they think somehow Catholics are owned by the Vatican and other denominations aren't, and the latter basically ensures that they'd never vote for him regardless.  Josh has the unfortunate issue of sharing the last name with an absolute moron, and unless a person knows better or pays attention they'd think they are one in the same.

"My hope would be for a populist to campaign.   The Democrats have been spending lots of time on rooting for candidates who, although lean left, aren't strong enough when it comes to addressing bread-and-butter policies. No matter what rhetoric now-President Trump threw during his campaign, his focus on issues like the economy and immigration made him a new glimmer of potential for common folks.   The current ""establishment"" Democratic party that fails to stand by the real working and middle class needs to step aside for a bit. It would be a similar transformation that happened to the GOP when they decided to go with Donald Trump back in 2016. Everyone kept saying Trump is crazy in every election he ran, but the voters ultimately don't lie (and had COVID not happened, I assume he would have won then as well).  It's possible to get a bunch of campaign money without having to abide to the wills of wealthy donors.  It's possible to prioritize hard working Americans without turning backs on our allies (like with these stupid tariffs and appeasing to Russia).  Running the campaign of ""we're not Trump/MAGA"" isn't going to make the cut. It didn't make the cut in 2024 (even with Liz Cheney, whose appearances, btw, show how down-bad Democrats became), and it will not make the cut in 2028 (assuming some other MAGA oriented candidate becomes the GOP frontrunner).",TwentyOne37,2025-03-07T11:16:49,1
"Andy Beshear- 2 term Governor of Kentucky (red state). I think his publicity was just the right amount to be noticed, liked, and respected.  Also, Beshear being one of Harris’ number 2 picks early on won’t be remembered.

Because I attend school out of state, I *had* to pick up my medications **that day.**  Desperately made a call to KYNECT (1.5 hours total) and I was reinstated.

"Some of these comments are completely insane and show how out of touch a lot of people are. People don't understand the overall sentiment towards the Democratic party and what the actual majority of voters want to see happen. The far left 2% is not the majority. Yes, they're very vocal, but they constitute a tiny minority.   People here are seriously thinking AOC stands a chance? Even if Trump's approval rating is at 20% in 2028, she'd lose badly. The attack ads against her practically will write themselves. She's been a target of the far right for years. No moderates will vote for her. New Jersey, Minnesota, and Virginia would be swing states. New Hampshire would flip red. It wouldn't matter who her opponent is.   Same applies to Newsom. Voters just rejected a perceived ""liberal"" Californian. You think another one will somehow win? Sorry, but home state does matter.   That's also why Wes Moore also would lose. Despite an impressive background, voters won't be able to relate to a liberal black Marylander. Sorry, but it's the truth.   Pritzker also would lose badly, for mostly the same reasons. A Pritzker candidacy would make Dems look like hypocrites, considering he is wealthier than Trump. Also, when most people think of Illinois, they think of crime in Chicago. Case closed, unless he pulls off a landslide reelection in 2026 where he flips Trump +20 counties blue.   Buttigieg is gay and is closely associated to the most unpopular Democratic president in modern history. Maybe in the far future he'll be viable, but at least a couple decades need to pass.   Whitmer is a tier above all these candidates so far, but too many Americans won't vote for a female. She'd flip Michigan blue but possibly not any other states and not enough to win even if she did.  Warnock would flip Georgia, but moderate working class midwesterners will struggle to relate to him. I'm not sure he'd flip any other states.  Okay, now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about who actually could WIN.     Don't listen to the loons on the far left here- Shapiro is the strongest choice, by a significant margin. He's popular with 30% of Trump voters in Pennsylvania, a number that is probably starting to increase, if anything. No Pennsylvania pretty much means no presidency, now that Arizona has become a MAGA state (after almost a decade of clinging to its McCain neocon roots). He's not afraid to venture into deep red areas and talk with ordinary voters about their concerns. He has a positive working relationship with the 3 Republican statewide elected officeholders. Hell, David McCormick ran ads that highlighted his work with Shapiro, and he managed to win. Harris led the PA polls when Shapiro was the betting favorite to be VP, and Trump's campaign was genuinely afraid he'd be picked. Shapiro actually can fire up crowd and electrify a room when he does rallies. No other Democrat has that ability. Yeah okay, he sounds similar to Obama. So what? Does anyone actually think ordinary voters will prioritize THAT? Seriously? Also, it shouldn't and WOULDN'T matter to most voters that he's Jewish. A growing number of young voters, particularly males, think Democrats are the ones who are antisemitic. Shapiro would change that sentiment. Okay, he'd get crushed in Dearborn, Michigan. But he'd flip upwards of 20 other counties in the state blue. Because he actually APPEALS to moderate, rural, working class Obama x2 - Trump x3 voters. THOSE voters see him as reasonable and don't see him as condescending, unlike the other aforementioned Dems. And sorry, but those voters HEAVILY outnumber the far-left ""muh Palestine"" online trolls who will tell you otherwise. Those voters don't go on social media. I've spoken with MAGA people who agree with me. I've spoken to other MAGA people who have said that they've spoken to their politically like-minded friends who also agree with me. Shapiro would win, potentially by a landslide. He'd win Pennsylvania potentially by double digits, he'd easily flip Michigan and Wisconsin, and it's not impossibly that he'd be competitive in neighboring Ohio, considering the hell Trump will inflict on the state. Don't listen to uneducated dolts like Scott Presler who will try and gaslight you into believing that he's someone he's not or that he's somehow going to lose in 2026.",No_Presentation2558,2025-03-08T01:52:59,1

I have a few candidates that I am almost certain will run and that I think are legit :   Aoc Walz Crockett  Whitmer  Beshear  Kamala  Angela alsobrooks  Amy klobuchar    My dream ticket is a re run of Harris-Walz, but I'm not sure if we're gonna get that.  But don't forget, both Biden and Trump had 4 years off before running for president and winning.  I strongly believe the same could happen with Kamala.   If we don't get Harris-Walz, then the discussion opens up :   I love AOC, but she's really young and far left.   I love Walz.     Crockett is absolutely filthy and loves to muck it up and play the game of chess   Whitmer is extremely popular in MI/WI, 2 absolute must win states.  She's a no nonsense candidate with a proven track record.  I think she would do well.   Beshear- more of a southern charm.  I see him as more of a VP.  I think you need more thump in president    Angela alsobrooks- she's new.  She's from MD.  I love her.  She's a great speaker and she calls things like they are.  There's just something about her that I love.     Amy klobuchar- she's more of a long shot but not impossible.   After Harris-Walz, my other dream ticket is alsobrooks/walz.  I'm telling you, I LOVE Angela alsobrooks.  I think voters would love her.

"2028 could be one of the easiest elections for Democrats to sweep in.  JD Vance is not a strong candidate and he could easily fall into the same trap Kamala Harris was in.  1. An increasingly unpopular President  2. Unable to break from Trumps policy  3. Tied to an administration that by 2027/2028 will be overseeing another difficult period in American history  It’s basically 2008 all over again  Plus, he won’t be able to switch public opinion and become likable at the last hour like Harris did.   With that being said  The saying that Democrats only defeat themselves in elections is extremely true   Harris wasn’t a bad candidate but she was not the person for this moment.   But if she does to run in 2028, she needs to be EXTREMELY ready to take the Democratic Party down into the mud because that’s the only way to win. Tim Walz was not a good pick either.   Newsom kind of exploded his chances with that interview with Charlie Kirk so he’s essentially written himself off.   Whoever the choice needs to be 1. Extremely charismatic and personable  2. Extremely outspoken and aggressive  3. Not scared to play dirty and I’m taking like really dirty.  4. No real ties to anyone named Clinton or Obama  5. Knows how to work and win middle and lower income communities   My best guess would be either Josh Shapiro (PA) and Gretchen Whitmer (MI)   Both are governors of states that are going to be hit hard by Trumps tariffs, increased inflation and cuts to the federal government. Plus, you add a recession into the mix and try to tell the people of Michigan to vote republican again when their former popular governor is running.   If Shapiro gets the nomination then Whitmer needs to be his VP, it would secure up the Midwest for them or at least give them an advantage.   If Whitmer is the nominee, it becomes a little bit more tricky. Clinton did win the popular vote and Harris did out fundraise Trump so a woman can be a strong candidate. And by now, Democrats SHOULD know what’s coming their way by nominating a woman again.  But this is where a strong VP candidate comes into play.  She would HAVE to pick a young, charismatic “alpha male” type guy or else fall into the same trap Harris fell into with Walz. He wasn’t ready for the national spotlight and it dragged her down. Vance almost brought Trump down until the VP debate changed public opinion on Walz. So she needs to have a VP that can stand on their own and attract that male audience that Walz didn’t.  It’s American politics, you got to play the game   But if we were to elect our first woman President, I think she could do it, she is a combination of Hilary Clinton’s work ethic and Kamala Harris’s likability with both of their levels of experience.   My best guess for a winning Democratic ticket is Shapiro - Whitmer.   If it’s Whitmer, Ruben Gallego (AZ) gives you the Latino vote so that helps you in AZ, NV, GA & PA Wes Moore helps you with the African American vote so that’s PA, MI, NC, & GA Jon Ossoff helps you with younger voters and the south as well but has a more overall appeal   But Democrats need to get their message cohesive, clear and start making getting it across NOW.  Trump campaigned for basically 4 years & the republicans fell in line behind him.  Democrats need to start doing the same ",Cute_Comfortable9848,2025-03-12T06:07:24,1
"I’m from Michigan. Big Gretch is widely hated by lots of Republicans…and yet she very easily wins each gubernatorial election in the state. She’s liberal enough for the liberals, and moderate enough for everyone else. Nationally, she’s extremely politically palatable. I see her campaigning as a VP at the very least. But seeing as she wasn’t on the last ticket as a VP…I think her eye is on the Presidential seat.   I’m also Black. Unfortunately,  We will never have a Black president again, because racism. Raphael Warnock, great man and public servant as he is, would not be successful on a ticket unless as a VP, with a white man on the Presidential ticket. And that’s just the reality.  Pete Buttigieg might have a chance as a VP, but I think he is less appealing to liberals and more appealing to moderates. I personally like his approach, often appearing as a guest on Fox, snarky and no nonsense when it’s required. He can give it as good as he gets it on Fox. This also means he could appeal to many conservative Republicans, however, they may take issue with his sexuality and views on LGBTQ+ issues. A recently extremely polarizing topic in politics and not what the Dems need right now. Their campaign needs to be focused on American issues not just American LGBTQ+ issues.  Josh Shapiro—it’s possible. But I don’t think he’s charismatic enough to really build a campaign for winning. I think out of everyone listed, he may be the most realistic—but they need to start grooming him for the ticket, like yesterday.   I don’t know enough about Jared Polis to comment.  Wes Moore—unfortunately no for the same reasons as Warnock. Though Moore may be able to push his military service value especially for a VP race. But lately it seems veterans aren’t getting the kind of political clout they used to.   AOC—the DNC would never. She’s hated in her own party for not being a doormat and not going along with all of the Dem morality politics and games of conceding to crazy requests from across the aisle. She’s also been labeled as too liberal by many moderates and traditional republicans. I think MAGA would have too easy of a time doing a smear campaign on her because of this—stoking irrational fears of trans kids using the “wrong” bathroom etc. you know, all their usual internalized phobias.   Anyway, I hope I didn’t come across as offensive, these are just my observations. ",Heckinshoot,2025-03-12T09:30:08,1

"I don't think it's that simple.   Or, rather, what counts as ""people oriented policies that benefit Americans"" is incredibly subjective and the very crux of the issue of how we win future elections.   Obviously, most people reading this right now believe that Democratic policies benefit Americans far more than Trump's policies - myself included.   But let's keep ourselves grounded in data.  [Let's look at voter turnout in 2024, first](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2024:_Analysis_of_voter_turnout_in_the_2024_general_election). There's been a lot of noise that voter turnout was lower in 2024 than in 2020 - and that's very true. 63.7% vs 66.6%.  But to figure out what that means demographically (who stayed home, where, and why?), we have to dig deeper.  The average turnout in states that Trump won in the 2024 presidential election was 63.4%. This is down from 65.0% in 2020. Meanwhile, the average turnout in states Harris won was 66.4%, down from 70.1% that Biden won.  So both parties lost voters going from 2020 to 2024, but there's definitely a noticeable gap - Trump lost about 1.6% on average, and Harris lost 3.7% on average.   More Democratic-leaning voters stayed home in 2024.  But that's also not the whole story, because we still need to understand where those voters lived to understand whether they swayed the election. Democratic voters staying home in California, for example, is basically meaningless.   If we cut out the ""safe"" staunchly red and blue states, and look at the seven 2024 *battleground* states, they tell a very different story.  The average turnout in the seven battleground states was 70% in 2024, compared to 70.7% in 2020. Only a fraction of a percent drop - basically flat. People didn't stay home in the moderate battleground states, even if they did in safer, polarized districts.   Arizona and North Carolina are outliers within that group, seeing a -5% and -2.5% drop in voter turnout, respectively. But Harris [lost Arizona by more than 5%](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/arizona/?r=0), and [by more than 2.5% in North Carolina](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/north-carolina/?r=0) - so even if we assume that every single voter who stayed home was Democratic-leaning (certainly not actually true), Harris still would have lost had they all come out to vote.   The math is pretty compelling. In the moderate battleground states where the votes mattered, the election wasn't lost by Democrats staying home - it was lost by these moderate electorates lurching to the right and actively voting for Trump.  Democrats may have stayed home over Republicans by a couple % delta elsewhere in the country, but they did so almost entirely in districts that were already decided.   We ultimately lost 2024 because the moderate middle actively chose Trump's policies over Democratic policies.    We therefore have to ask ourselves why.   It's not as simple as just saying that we need people focused policies if we seemingly don't know what the people deciding elections in moderate states actually want.",The_Law_of_Pizza,2025-03-07T07:06:19,62

"Harris would lose the primaries before they began. No sane voters would actually support her again. My hunch is she will run for Governor of California, win, and become the first black female governor in American history. And then she'll bow out of the presidential election by mid 2027 or so.      Moore would be a strong candidate if he were governor of a swing state, not of deep blue Maryland. Looking at his tenure, I approve of some of his actions, but a lot of other things he's done (or hasn't tried to stop) would make him struggle to gain national appeal.  Pritzker would do even worse. No one will support an Illinois billionaire. The attack ads against him will write themselves. I like how he's been openly fighting Trump, but people associate Illinois with Chicago, and people associate big cities with high crime and homelessness. The end.  Shapiro is exponentially stronger than either of them. When most people think of Pennsylvania, they think of a politically balanced and diverse state that is known for supporting moderate Democrats who seek consensus. Shapiro has a 60% approval rating.

"Now for some others- I'm glad people are recognizing that Beshear would be a strong choice also. The ""radical liberal socialist"" smear would never stick on him, because it can easily be rebutted with ""Do you seriously think Kentucky would elect a Democrat like that?"" It's really hard to dislike Beshear. He comes across as neighborly, down-to-earth, and genuine. He would win, and would potentially make major inroads in the rural deep south, although not by anywhere close to enough to make those deep red states actually competitive. The issue for him is that he lacks name recognition, and he doesn't have that many accomplishments as governor because the Republican supermajorities in the legislature severely constrain him.   Jeff Jackson is another candidate that's being tossed around. He also would potentially win. North Carolina Democrats are famously moderate, enough so that the party has remained remarkably resilient, not being in any danger of collapsing and going extinct like what's happened to Democrats in Alabama and Arkansas and the rest of the deep red south. Nor has their Democratic party gone extinct temporarily, only to revive themselves years later, like they've done in Georgia and Virginia. I've listened to Jackson speak and he'd have crossover appeal.   I'm surprised people haven't mentioned Ruben Gallego, considering they've brought up Mark Kelly. Kelly has managed to win twice, and will very likely win again in 2028 because of his moderate reputation and the fact that he's a highly-regarded figure in his state. Cultural icons do well in places like Arizona. However, outran Harris by over 8 points because he has shown that he appeals to Latino males, a demographic that is drinking the MAGA kool-aid en masse. Probably because he is one himself and he's established himself as an immigration hawk who's at odds with much of his party. However, he's sort of lacking in the public speaking department.

This isn't 2008. Trump will NEVER end up like Bush. Hell, as far as I'm concerned, they should be assuming that Trump will run for an illegal third term and be favored to win, even though such a scenario is still unlikely, as of now. But Trump is a candidate for the 2028 betting markets, so it's clearly on the table.   I've heard many nonsensical criticisms of Shapiro from MAGA cultists, and many petulent and selfish criticisms of him from the far left. However, ""not charismatic enough"" isn't one of them.

"I don't think we'll get a definitive answer to the ""why"" question until November '28, or at the very least, until the primaries. Did Harris lose because of Biden? Or is Trump a singularly powerful politician who only lost in 2020 because of Covid and its consequences? Did people prefer Trump's policies, or did they not really pay any attention to what Harris was selling? I think there's data you can point to that backs up all of the above, and it's all just guesswork at this point.  The main thing, in my opinion, is that the party has to reckon with an unreasonable electorate. I'm not saying that Americans were smarter when they voted for Clinton or Reagan or JFK, but where do we even begin to make sense of the fact that people wanted cheaper stuff and ended up voting for a guy who threatened to put tariffs on most of our closest trade partners? Or that a lot of people seemed to want a more middle-of-the-road approach to reproductive rights but ended up backing the guy who killed Roe? I've heard people say Harris lost because she campaigned with Liz Cheney in (very few, small-ish) Wisconsin town hall-type events and that she was the queen of DEI who wanted open borders and socialized... everything? I don't think either of these ""she was too right/left-wing"" arguments explain how every place in the country except a few counties in GA and CO swung hard to the right. The party has to figure out why that happened, and most importantly, I think, if it was just a Trump phenomenon. But the issue is, I don't think there's data to answer these questions yet.   They'll (probably) be fine, and this ""Dems in the wilderness"" narrative pushed by the media is overblown. If the GOP could come back from Nixon and the GOP, Dems can get back from losing an election that was always going to be close.

"I'm breaking this next section off into a separate comment, because after looking at *where* we lost in terms of electoral college votes, now I'm going to dig a little deeper into the data behind *why*.  Up front, there's no doubt that ""the economy"" is the elephant in the room - [with roughly 40% of voters in the seven battleground states identifying it as their single most important consideration](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast/).   It would be easy to stop there and just chalk the loss up to unavoidable Covid inflation and move on, but I don't think that's right.   When we look at more detailed breakdowns, it becomes clear that there's stark divisions along the lines of education, sex, and race. Across the battleground states (and nationally), we lost people with no college degree roughly 56% to 43%. We lost men 55% to 43%. We lost white people 56% to 42%.   In other words, there's a noticeable, sharp trend where we lost blue collar white men - a statistic that dovetails with the *second place* issue articulated in the data: immigration, which was the top issue for about 20% of the electorate. Blue collar white men, who often work in low skill, manual labor roles, are most at risk in terms of economic pressure from immigration.   While immigration may be a net positive for the country as a whole, there's also no denying that a glut of immigrant labor will put downward pressure on job opportunities and wages for this exact demographic of blue collar white men. So the two largest electoral issues for voters - the economy and immigration, at a combined 60% - are actually sort of intertwined for this cohort. The more immigrants there are competing for manual labor jobs, the worse the economy feels for this electoral group who depend on those same jobs.   Personally, I think this is the true crux of what happened statistically. I think the Democratic party thought we had a lock on blue collar men because of the historical nature of union politics. But as our party's demographics shifted more heavily towards white collar, educated professionals (the NPR crowd - of which I'm one), we didn't fully realize that the NPR crowd's pro-immigration stance was actively at odds with the economic interests of those blue collar men.   We were making a demographic *trade off* when we thought we were building a unified coalition.

As a brand Republicans are known to be tough on immigration, pro-Gun, Anti-Taxes, pro-Business, and anti-Spending. Some of that isn't necessarily accurate to the way Republicans behave in office but it is what people broadly believe. Democrats are viewed as pro- education, pro-healthcare, pro-safety nets, pro-regulation, etc.   If the headlines voters see most are about immigration that is an automatic win for Republicans. Because Republicans are viewed as tougher on that issue. The more immigration is discussed the more important it becomes to voters and the better it becomes for Republicans. Nothing a Democratic candidate could say about immigration matters.   Playing defense only keeps an issue stirring in the media. That is why candidates must pivot to offense.

Sure, he didn't talk about it at every rally, but he identified a stance that was sufficiently tolerable to enough of the voter base to help him win and firmly stood his ground on it.  An election where Trump is widely considered the national abortion ban guy rather than the leave it up to the states guy is one Dems are way more likely to win.  The way I look at it the campaign that can talk about everything because they have a reasonably electable position on every issue has a huge advantage over the campaign that has to weasel around issues because if they talk about them they can't present a vision that is actually tolerable to the majority of the electorate.  As an aside, I would also point out that Democrats only have limited control over what issues the media talks about. There are some outlets that are likely to keep their mouths shut if Dems tell them that talking about certain issues will hurt them, sure, but less partisan outlets will still talk about them and right wing outlets will talk about little else.

"Several grassroot progressive organizations have been formed and/or exploded in membership since Sanders first presidential run in 2016. Many younger people are getting involved in these organizations, or outright running for office, and largely are attributing their motivation to him. This has resulted in an over 30% increase in the house's progressive caucus in that time, with large organizations backing them in a way that progressives have never had.  Sanders has consistently been open about the fact he isn't going to get his policies himself, and that it will take a large movement fighting for them, and that his focus is on building that movement. Within that context, I think it is fair to say he has made significant progress. His goal was always a long term project meant to continue on even after he is out of politics, looking for singular wins to list at this moment is missing the entire point of what he is doing.",YeetedApple,2025-03-09T10:07:35,1

">So basically 80%, a vast majority, don’t give a shit about immigration.  No, that's not true at all - play around with the issues/beliefs filters in my link.   Roughly 20% of people thought that immigration was *the single most important issue*, but roughly another 45% beyond that thought that immigration was ""an important factor, just not the most important,"" - so roughly 65% of the electorate thought immigration was an important factor in their election decision.   In terms of how broad the topic of immigration is (and how people might want it handled in different ways), you're right - but use the filters to see how people feel about Harris' vs Trump's ability to handle immigration policy. About 50%+ felt that Trump was the better candidate for that topic, while only the mid-to-high 30%s felt that way about Harris.   It's clear from the data that most of the country felt that immigration was a significant contributor to their vote, and that most of the country favored Trump's approach to immigration over Harris'.   This is why it's important to look at the data, rather than just making gut assumptions based on how *you* personally feel on a topic.

California is our most populous state, so yes, more bad things would happen there than in North Dakota. I've been to both. California has shitty bits and good bits.

">It’s also pretty clear you don’t know what neoliberal or populist mean.  Neoliberal is a nebulous term but generally I'd call anyone who supports the Regan/Clinton era approach to economic and geopolitical issues, anyone who supports the status quo that has been cemented in our government since those years, or anyone who subribes to the Chicago school of economics line of thought neoliberal.  Bonus points if you have any defense at all in favor of Pinochet.   Biden might have had some protectionist tendencies but largely stood in favor of the neoliberal status quo and Harris did nothing to differentiate herself from Biden. Im glad he walked the picket line and got the rail workers sorted out, but too little too late. Regardless of how good our soft landing from Covid was compared to the rest of the world, Americans are getting squeezed from every direction and inflation was the straw that broke the camels back.   Whether you or me or anyone else thinks populism is bad is irrelevant. It's where we are at now and how we got here is prioritizing GDP growth and globalization with no thought about what to do with the people losing their livelihoods. I get *why* we did that but it is foolish to think you can crater an entire regions livelihood and not have significant backlash. Those chickens are coming home to roost.   At this point chipping around the edges is not going to cut it, radical action is what people want. The leaders of the MAGA movement are all full of shit about helping average Americans but they promised (and are delivering) rapid, radical change. Acting as the world's mob boss/dismantling the federal government and outsourcing it's duties to private corporations is a fucking disaster but people wanted change and the dems weren't offering it.  If Democrats want to compete they will have to advocate for radical change, the boogeyman should be Wall Street, and they have to push the message that only they can change it. Actually following this up with aggressive action will be important.   They will also have to boldly resist the trump admin, which probably means primarying a bunch of them because this current crop of feckless limp dicks are embarrassing to watch. Even before this they couldn't even performatively stand up to wall street by banning congressman from stock trading. These are not the right people for the moment.  Honest question, do you have any ideas about how to deal with popular support for radically changing the status quo?

Even if harris didn’t differentiate herself from Biden (which I disagree with, but we’ll take your (misinformed) word for it) Biden is not neoliberal.   Inflation was better in America than anywhere else in the western world thanks to Biden’s policy. You can downplay the incredible achievement that soft landing was all you want, again all it does is highlight your own ignorance.   Populism is objectively bad. It should be rejected by anybody who cares about a functioning society. You can change political priorities without resorting to conspiratorial ideology.   I think you are just completely misguided about what the words you use mean. Calling the most progressive presidential platform this country has ever seen as “centrist” is just insane.
