"Here's his letter to Kristi Noem and the acting director of ICE demanding action on the Garcia case, signed by 25 Dem Senators . Van Hollen represents Maryland, the state where Garcia was residing with his family (American citizens) when ICE banged on his door and falsely told him his immigration status had changed.

Under multiple Democratic and Republican administrations, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE followed the rule of law and worked to quickly return people who were wrongfully deported, in the rare instances where such “administrative errors” occurred. The Administration’s mass deportation agenda does not transcend immigration law or the need for due process. And when the Administration makes a mistake as severe as sending an individual with protected status to a foreign prison, it cannot simply shrug off responsibility and allege that there is nothing it can do to reunite him with his wife and child, who are American citizens.",Fit-Building-2560,2025-04-14T21:58:51,11
