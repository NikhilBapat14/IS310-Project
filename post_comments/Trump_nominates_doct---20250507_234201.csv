"Ok, so Trump dropped his original recommendation, which he based on eye candy and support for RFK Jr, for a ginger version of the same eye candy with support for RFK Jr. At least that's how that looks to me",StormFireX001,2025-05-07T23:57:51,16
"This is the ""meritocracy"" MAGA promised by pushing anti-DEI, nothing but nepobabies, big $ donors, people intended to destroy the department and not care, and unqualified loyalists. Truly a confederacy of dunces.",WafflePartyOrgy,2025-05-08T00:22:38,14
Quit the medical profession six months before completing her residency.   Couldn't hack it as a doctor so now she is mad at them.,UglyWanKanobi,2025-05-08T01:12:01,15

Trump probably believes she'll be performing surgeries as surgeon general,Objective-Act-2093,2025-05-08T00:10:58,4
What? ¬†But she is DEI and took the place of a white male who should have gotten that spot in med school. The world makes no sense!?!?!?!   /s in case you can‚Äôt tell,Ugh-screen-name,2025-05-08T01:07:10,3

"Trump‚Äôs cabinet picks feel less like policy and more like casting for America‚Äôs Next Top Doctor. Drama, plot twists, and a dash of pseudoscience.   Coming up next, the immunity challenge.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-08T05:24:05,1

"Trump's base is a bro club and that (played down) eye candy is for them. Obviously they can't go all out and just hire a stripper (yet), but hey it could happen.¬† I'm not going to be suprised if they do lol.¬† Gotta keep the boys excited and watching so their brains melt further.¬†¬†",arilupe,2025-05-08T05:47:45,1

"She‚Äôs not a surgeon, did not complete residency and is not licensed- anywhere",AttitudeJolly4403,2025-05-08T00:30:03,12
My Veterinarian Mike is more qualified. If Mike was named Surgeon General he‚Äôd be very skeptical of himself. These people think they‚Äôre qualified for anything.,JackKovack,2025-05-08T00:56:23,7

Black SUV‚Äôs start pulling up. James Woods and Jon Voight both said how great their vet was. Trump took it way too seriously and ordered an emergency confirmation.,JackKovack,2025-05-08T02:06:50,2
As do i but there is simply no other explanation for why Trump keeps putting these completely unqualified women into these positions who go out of their way to kiss his ass every chance they get.,Finaldeath,2025-05-08T02:07:41,1
They're probably easy to manipulate and hate the current professionals in the department. That seems to be the only qualification other than professional-level ring kissing.,anfornum,2025-05-08T04:22:11,1
