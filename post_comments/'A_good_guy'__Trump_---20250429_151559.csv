"Bezos folds in a suck-up call to Trump. He's rich but he doesn't want to let a cent go, pay decent wages to workers, or, per reports, stop treating them like indentured serfs without even time to take a piss. His rockets are the ultimate burn up of cash he could use to help others but instead they are a giant ''fuck you' to civilization. His legacy is cemented as a weakling avaricious dumpster fire.      Trump called Bezos on Tuesday morning to complain about the reports, two senior officials in the White House [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/29/business/white-house-calls-report-that-amazon-is-adding-a-tariff-charge-a-hostile-action/index.html), adding the president was “pissed.”  Trump [confirmed](https://x.com/cspan/status/1917288794153160864?s=46) Tuesday afternoon he talked to “good guy” Bezos, who “did the right thing” and “solved the problem very quickly,” according to the president.",True_Paper_3830,2025-04-29T15:16:38,12

"The largest importer of consumer use foreign goods is too scared to post tariff cost???   Beginning to look like a good time to drop that Amazon membership.   If Trump was so damn proud of his putting tariffs on foreign goods, why is he too embarrassed to let it be publicized when you make a purchase? I thought the whole goal was to stop Americans from making overseas purchases. Now it sounds like a back room mafia deal for trump and his cronies to make tons of ""Sicilian Extortion"" money at the expense of the American public.",IndependentRegion104,2025-04-29T16:19:21,3
