"This is terrible negotiating. Going from 145% to 80% would not materially improve the situation, but making the offer does signal that the U.S. knows it has the weaker hand.",gradientz,2025-05-09T11:27:51,15

I bet the Chinese diplomats are giddy with excitement. They’re about to position China to dominate for the next decade plus.  MAGA can spin this all they want China knows what they’re doing and Trump does not.  Every outcome here is a huge win for China. Even the worst outcome of high tariffs for US imports is a long term win for them. Yes there would be a recession (or worse) but who is hurt more there? I’d say we are.  The best case here is a deal is struck to eliminate tariffs and sure we all get something here but China then gets the most benefit. Then all they have to do is keep chipping away at our global dominance.  To me this whole trade war is an overall loser for us. Yea sure we can maybe get some manufacturing here (we likely won’t) but it has cost us our global footing. If that was the goal then Trump has done a fantastic job.,hmr0987,2025-05-09T12:03:13,6

80% is still effectively a blockade.  Makes no difference in the situation.,robot_egg,2025-05-09T11:32:16,2
"Trump thinks China is going to lose out when it's too expensive to buy goods from there. News flash to Trump, the US isn't the only country on earth to do business with China. The only ones losing out are US consumers when they can't buy goods they need.   He's not doing anything to change manufacturing here nor make it cheaper to do so",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-09T11:48:15,2
"So, the middle class will still be paying 80% tax on our purchases.  Terriffs are always going to be passed along to the consumer,punishing them with higher prices.",Kyrin999,2025-05-09T11:55:00,2

The Chinese should just refuse to negotiate as long as Trump is president. It’d probably hurt the US more than China.   But China has no reason to do us favors like that. ,Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-09T18:42:00,1

It's obvious who would be affected more by this. Chinese people aren't importing boat loads of John Deer tractors and Tennessee whiskey or shirts and shoes made by American children in sweatshops.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T12:16:26,1
