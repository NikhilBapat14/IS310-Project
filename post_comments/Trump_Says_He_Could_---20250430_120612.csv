"Of course he won't. Narcissists don't do backsies because to them it's an admission of weakness. Being wrong is weak to them. Even when proven to BE wrong, they won't back away from their stance or retract anything. In his world, which somehow is merging into reality with his sychophants pandering to his every whim, he can't possibly be wrong and his actions are always justified. ",FelchMasterFlexNuts,2025-04-30T12:17:09,5

"“The U.S. Treasury Department reported in 2021 that Bukele’s government had provided financial incentives to gangs to keep homicide numbers low, and said that gang members received special privileges in prisons, such as access to sex workers and mobile phones.

"“Trump announces that water is in fact wet.”   Of course he could get Kilmar back. But this admission from him is conclusive evidence alone of his contempt. When us regular folks don’t follow court orders, we get show cause orders, then eventually contempt if we don’t comply, which has serious consequences. But he’s Trump so I guess it’s all good?

"I looked this up and apparently is it perfectly legal to send them to a third country and not their home country as long as that country has agreed to take them.  The problem is often that a third country will not agree to this, so most are sent home.  However, the US has contracted with El Salvador to incarcerate those that we send to their country and in exchange we will pay them 6 million dollars.  I am not sure if that is a one time payment or if it is something we will have to pay regularly.  So, those that are being deported are literally being sent to El Salvador in chains and are being taken off the plane and immediate to a maximum security prison without any hearing and without and proof that these people have committed any serious crimes.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-30T12:22:24,5

"Have you seen the new ICE/detainment budget proposal? 80 BILLION is what they are planning to spend on rounding up and sending immigrants to prisons they will live in until they die. As reported no one is released from these prisons. They barely got Garcia out and they just moved him to a different prison.   So unless all this awful shit actually gets reversed, taxpayers will be paying 80 Billion to round up immigrants and imprison them until they die.   Thanks to the Republican Regime we’ll all be complicit in paying for the murder of these people. They were forcefully abducted and shipped to this lifetime imprisonment without due process. The government is paying to keep them in that situation and ignoring court orders to return these people or provide due process. Therefore murder.
