">The Trump administration is planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, according to U.S. officials, another sharp escalation in a deportation program that has sparked widespread legal challenges and intense political debate.  >The nationalities of the migrants were not immediately clear, but a flight to Libya carrying the deportees could leave as soon as Wednesday, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the operation.  >The decision to send deportees to Libya was striking. The country is racked with conflict, and human rights groups have called conditions in its network of migrant detention centers “horrific” and “deplorable.”",fungobat,2025-05-06T21:36:48,30

That would require some semblance of due process and working with the home country to accept the returning immigrants. That leaves a paper trail and potential investigations.

"https://theconversation.com/why-zelensky-not-trump-may-have-won-the-us-ukraine-minerals-deal-255875  A joint investment fund the US is very unlikely to ever profit from is not “draining”.  My point remains: if Trump is so pro-Russian that you think he’s going to send Putin migrants to conscript, why is he still giving Ukraine military aid? Why is Ukraine still benefiting from US intelligence and Starlink? Why are we sanctioning Russia? Wouldn’t a Russian asset start helping Russia at some point?",Savings-Coffee,2025-05-07T00:29:44,-8

"So Trump offered Russia a peace deal that they didn’t think was enough, and somehow this makes him pro-Russian? Do you not see any flaw in your logic here? Wouldn’t a Russian asset offer a peace deal that Russia actually wanted?  Again, Russia is going to decline any peace deal that involves conceding territory they’ve occupied in a war they believe they’re winning. Offering a deal like that would be completely pointless.   You’re also still ignoring the reality that Ukraine’s capacity to resist is heavily dependent on aid within Trump’s control that he keeps supplying. If he’s the FSB’s top guy, why are we still giving Ukraine aid and intelligence?",Savings-Coffee,2025-05-07T01:04:43,-2
