If AoC and Bernie don’t endorse him at one of their rallies I will riot.,Lontology,2025-05-01T11:17:00,13
"After what Cuomo did during the COVID pandemic, it would be incredibly short-sighted to put him in charge of NYC.  Here's hoping Zohran wins.",jayfeather31,2025-05-01T11:50:55,7
I would be ecstatic if he won. I don’t want Cuomo anywhere near a position of power after the crap he’s done. I’m ready for politicians actually interested in serving their constituents and not their own interests.,Jamira360,2025-05-01T11:35:18,7
"He's really awesome honestly, if he pulls this off I would be so happy. I think it's a longshot, but he's just a GREAT guy with GREAT politics. We haven't seen someone like him in American politics for decades, not even Bernie.",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-01T11:17:35,8
Don’t mess with the Zohran.,RolandTower919,2025-05-01T13:28:39,1
Wow I thought that was an insult. Thanks for the link.,Numerous-Most-5325,2025-05-01T13:50:11,5
Coin flip on that.....feels overly optimistic.,hereforthepeens,2025-05-01T23:47:47,1
Bernie walked so we could run....back to the Democrats.   Socialism or bust. We don't have time for more centrist bullshit. I am not from NY but God I hope he wins.,hereforthepeens,2025-05-01T23:49:50,1
