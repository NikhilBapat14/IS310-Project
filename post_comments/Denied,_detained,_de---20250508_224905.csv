"This is a compilation of a whole bunch of horrifying stories of the trump admin unjustly detaining and deporting immigrants. These stories have been in the news, but there are some here that aren't as well-known and deserve more exposure. There are so many of these kinds of stories that it's hard to keep up. Definitely check this out and see what you may have missed.  Here's one story I didn't know about until now, and I'm heartbroken and disgusted. (I had a period of time when I took a break from looking at news, so I missed this story.)  >Migrants seeking asylum removed to Panama  >A US military plane took off from California in February carrying more than 100 immigrants from countries as far flung as Afghanistan, Iran, Uzbekistan, China, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Pakistan, dumping them in Panama. They were shackled and deported to a third country without due process because their countries of origin refuse to accept them back from the US. Shocking scenes unfolded of the people locked in a hotel in Panama City, signaling and writing on the windows pleading for help.  >The people, including children, were then moved and held at a facility deep in the dense jungle that separates Panama from Colombia. They were later reportedly freed and were seeking asylum from other countries, their futures uncertain. One of those deported from the US was:  >Artemis Ghasemzadeh  >Ghasemzadeh, 27, a migrant from Iran, wrote “Help us” in lipstick on a window of the hotel in Panama City, as a desperate way of alerting New York Times reporters on the street to her and fellow detainees’ plight. She had thought that, especially as a convert from Islam to Christianity who faces danger in Iran as a result, that she would be offered freedom in the US, she told the newspaper while still in custody. She is possibly still in Panama trying to get a foothold.",sachiprecious,2025-05-08T22:56:25,9

[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deportations](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/deportations)  For those STILL saying this is nothing like that... Consider the plans to deport them to Libya... We don't even have an embassy there.,williamgman,2025-05-08T23:41:43,3
