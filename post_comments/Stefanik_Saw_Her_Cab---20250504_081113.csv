This was written days before Waltz was demoted into the UN ambassador position.,rainshowers_5_peace,2025-05-04T08:11:58,11
Stefanik blaming Johnson instead of Trump shows that denial is not just a river in Egypt.  It was Trump who offered and then removed the U.N. Ambassador nomination to Stefanik. A MAGA Republican can not criticize Trump without facing his wrath.   And having that ambassadorship offered to Waltz is just icing on the cake.,anotherlab,2025-05-04T08:39:33,8
I mean I hate to say it but there's no reason to blame either? They were just afraid of losing the House. It just doesn't make clear sense why he didn't just renominate her after the victories in the Florida specials. But then *that* would be on Trump.,alabasterskim,2025-05-04T09:08:38,2
"Sounds like a lot of political drama. I mean, it's not surprising that she's blaming the speaker, politicians always seem to point fingers at each other.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-04T10:21:22,2
"It is arguable that Walz will be any more incompetent than Stefanik would have been.  Neither has familiarity with honesty.  Will the voters in Stefanik’s district feel like they’ve been well represented by a grifter, who was so anxious to abandon her constituents for the UN ambassador position?",EmbarrassedHeat1227,2025-05-04T12:44:06,1
"lol, so Walz, the moron that added a reporter to their illegal signal chat where Hegseth spilled classified intel in is getting in disgrace the job that sycophantic Steanik wanted and was gonna give up her house seat for?  It's such a murderer's rows of morons in the Trump orbit.",covfefe-boy,2025-05-04T08:34:36,11
