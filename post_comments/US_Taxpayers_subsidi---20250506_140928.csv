I don't know where he is getting his numbers from. Total federal spending on EBT (food stamps) in 2023 was $119 billion.,raccoonbandit13,2025-05-06T15:02:04,323
They should just not allow soda to be bought on ebt.,Patsfan311,2025-05-06T14:24:08,523

"I mean, I agree that EBT shouldn’t be able to be used for things like coke, but calling it a subsidy to the company’s that manufacture the food and drink is misleading.",RealisticTadpole1926,2025-05-06T17:43:17,67

"So over 330 billion for EBT cards?  There are 340 million people in the country.  That's about 1k per person....  How many people are on EBT cards, and how much are they getting?  It's supposed to be an assistant, not a fucking free ride.",letmeinfornow,2025-05-06T14:25:42,97
Funnily enough coke managed to utilize WWII to get the fed to fund their global expansion and the people were propagandized into being cool with it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MuQsH3gi5s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MuQsH3gi5s),A_Hatless_Casual,2025-05-06T17:04:08,9
Would it surprise you to know that there are over 80+ programs that are all for WELFARE. When totaled it is close to 1/3 of the budget.  [https://singlemotherguide.com/federal-welfare-programs](https://singlemotherguide.com/federal-welfare-programs),ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T15:02:01,6

"Yeah why is a unsourced post from some rando being used as a legitimate source? Regardless of the real statistics, I think food stamps should not be allowed for soda or highly processed foods. You should not be able to buy Coke and Cheetos with food stamps. If you're poor and trying to get ahead there's no shame in that. But if you're actually trying to get ahead start by drinking water and learning to cook with inexpensive ingredients. Our household income is over $300k/yr not counting dividends from investments. You know what you won't find in my fridge? Soda, juice, or anything like that. We drink water(not bottled), the kids drink water or milk. Maybe once or twice a month in the summer I might get a single Mexican coke and drink it. But poor people have this notion that water is for poor people so they won't drink it.",Coool_cool_cool_cool,2025-05-06T16:52:51,65
Isn't the point basically that people are individually choosing to buy coke which adds up to 10B? I believe the argument is just against junk food instead of EBT in general,fordr015,2025-05-06T20:33:36,19
I don’t know the answer here but do states also contribute to the EBT program? I know they administer it so if they do that could make it more believable.,uuid-already-exists,2025-05-06T19:24:26,4
I watched a guy buy 2 cases of purple and orange soda with his EBT card. Then spend $10 cash on 2 small luxury bottles of fabric softener.    Basic economics needs to be taught in school again.,Efficient-Cable-873,2025-05-06T15:22:29,141
I see people buy Red Bull and various energy drinks at overpriced gad station prices using their EBT cards all the time. It feels like insanity.,GeneticsGuy,2025-05-06T20:26:24,4
Should you even be shopping on EBT. It’s also supporting mega corporations like Walmart. Have them pick up weekly food packages from a government building supplied by cheapest supplier. You get what you get beggars can’t be choosers,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-06T14:54:51,29

"My favorite is when they buy junk food with food stamps, then pay cash for cigarettes. We're literally indirectly subsidizing addictions, including smoking, alcohol, gambling, and more. ",TheEternal792,2025-05-07T21:57:39,2
"Unfortunately that would be a nightmare to do. They'd have to accommodate for allergies, religious preferences, pay for warehousing, staff,  etc... Just limit EBT to staple goods like milk, bread, meats,  pasta, rice, and whatnot and let the recipient sort it out. Even corporations like Walmart have very slim profit margins when it comes to groceries.",ureallygonnaskthat,2025-05-06T16:04:19,59

Been around at least 20 years.   The Constitution says PROMOTE not PROVIDE.  And if you actually read it you would see the SPECIFIC programs and their costs.

They wouldn’t need to account for anything. Beggars can’t be choosers they are always free to get a decent paying job and buy what ever they want. You wouldn’t even need warehouse and staffing necessarily if Walmart wins the bid they can box it up and give it out at the grocery delivery.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-06T18:09:22,-24
"What do you mean? They already do.   You can’t go to chipotle, McDonald’s, your local food truck, and use EBT.  Edit: and honestly what’s the issue with the other guys premise? We do it for everything else in the government. We need 10 million cans of black beans. Who can supply it to us for the cheapest amount? We need 100k pounds of rice. Who can give it to us the cheapest?   I really don’t see an issue with it.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-06T16:40:48,14

"If you're paying with taxpayer funds, absolutely.   The government shouldn't have any say in how individuals purchase goods, except when the government is purchasing all of your goods, then the taxpayers should have all of the say.
