"As a Brit, my observation has been that the Democrats do not ever want to launch anyone other than Perfect Candidate.  The issue with Perfect Candidate is that they don’t and cannot exist. The only way to get even mildly close to Perfect Candidate is to field test. And that doesn’t mean ask questions on the street, return to DNC headquarters and cross out every name. What it means is have genuine party competition.  Your national elections are 4 years away but you guys need to be behind a candidate YESTERDAY.  Harris made sense. She could inherit the Biden-Harris 2024 war-chest, and it was practically 2 seconds until Election Day. There wasn’t time for a Primary to divide the electorate.

"Hard agree. The DNC creates perfect candidates in a test tube, poll tested, designed to never offend anyone. They can't go on long form podcasts and shit because they're bound to say a ""wrong"" thing over the course of an hour or so.   ""The left"" or ""progressivism"" has been inexorably tied to these personalities that come off as fake. When it comes to actual progressive ideas they're popular. Yet we have the Democrat establishment taking money creating their clones and losing. When people do get fed up enough with the Republicans we rarely end up actually delivering on popular policies either. They don't want actual progressive policies. I don't know how much of it is just corruption or how much of it is risk aversion. Regardless, the establishment keeps losing and we can't get rid of them.  How many people get to keep their job after they lose this many times? How many times do people have to fail to produce any kind of agenda, let alone execute it, and keep their job?
