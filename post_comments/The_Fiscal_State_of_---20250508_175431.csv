"In written testimony prepared for the House Budget Committee, [Joshua D. Rauh](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/joshua-d-rauh) argues that in fiscal policy, the “United States is on an unsustainable trajectory.” Rauh’s testimony emphasizes four key points. First, “Rising interest payments on the national debt will increasingly crowd out funding for essential government activities and increase the risk of future debt crises.” Second, “Delaying fiscal reforms will weaken long-term economic growth and prosperity.” Third, “Higher tax rates would harm economic activity and be counterproductive in addressing the debt crisis.” Finally, higher economic growth alone would not be sufficient to overcome budgetary pressures, so “spending reforms are the key to avoiding fiscal calamity.” With logical clarity and a grounding in hard economic data, Rauh shows that without “a credible commitment to pro-growth tax policy and major changes in long-term spending that would reduce structural deficits, America is headed for a fiscal crisis.”",HooverInstitution,2025-05-08T17:54:57,4
"Thanks for the list of problems Josh  Got any solutions?  Or are we just gonna keep whining to Powell to lower the interest rate, for the only reason of helping our national debt interest, maybe resorting to personal attacks will help?",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-08T19:16:26,4
