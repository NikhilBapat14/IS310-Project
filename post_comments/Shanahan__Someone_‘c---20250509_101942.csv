"> In a post on the social platform X, Shanahan called the announcement “strange,” adding that she was “promised” neither Casey Means nor Calley Means would serve at HHS or be appointed to any post if Shanahan supported Kennedy’s confirmation for the Cabinet post.  Who cares what you were promised? You backed that horse, repeatedly, and the whole country gets to spend the next however many generations shovelling out the stables. The details of what you want or prefer mean *nothing*.",ANOKNUSA,2025-05-09T10:31:45,12
"Starting to think the worm in RFK Jr.’s brain isn’t a parasite, it’s his campaign manager. Probably wears a tiny headset, runs debates from a hamster wheel, and yells “Stay on message!” every time he talks about vaccines.

There was never a brain worm. It was an excuse to get out of paying alimony to his wife that died of cancer. The brain worm joke/story gives him a pass on this awful and despicable behavior.,raw_bert0,2025-05-09T16:32:42,1
