"Also today from the WSJ:  >Sales of existing homes in March posted their biggest monthly decline in more than two years, kicking off a lackluster start to the critical spring selling season after economic uncertainty and high home prices kept buyers away.  >U.S. existing-home sales fell 5.9% in March from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.02 million, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. That marked the biggest month-over-month decline since November 2022.   So new homes are selling, existing ones are not. The reason is most likely because new homes don't have an existing owner locked in at a sub 3% rate. Those in homes with a low rate are not moving because of the rates, not because of economic uncertainty.",PartyOfFore,2025-04-24T09:33:49,34
"It’s because new construction homes are the same price as an updated existing home, but builders will pay your closing costs and/or buy down your rate.   That’s why we bought a new construction home last year. It’s actually cheaper.  I could’ve bought a comparable sized home for $30-$40,000 less, but then I’d have an HVAC system and a roof that’s 10 years old or older, kitchen, and bathrooms that need 30k in updates, old nasty carpet that needs turn out and LVP installed.  So looking at what a home is gonna cost me the first 5 to 10 years. New construction is way more affordable.",Zachmode,2025-04-24T10:24:09,19
"Affordable is a relative term. What is affordable in East TN is not affordable in NYC for example.  Say I have 250,000 to spend. What will that buy by state.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T10:23:30,6
Not giving up a 2.125% rate for a long time. Would be in the market but rates still need to come down still.,mahvel50,2025-04-24T09:49:50,8
"> The number of new single-family homes sold in March reached 724,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, a figure that’s 7.4% higher than February’s and 6% above March 2024.  ...  > The median sales price of new homes fell to $403,600, down 7.5 percent from a year earlier, reflecting increased supply at lower price points.",zroxx2,2025-04-24T09:23:44,3
I can't wait to buy my first house. My goal is before 2030,agk927,2025-04-24T10:01:58,4
This is the answer. Rent and keep that low interest rate. ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-24T09:49:03,12
"> The reason is most likely because new homes don't have an existing owner locked in at a sub 3% rate.  Entirely anecdotal/local, but builders in my area seem to be doing a lot of advertising lower rates via their preferred lenders.  So maybe both things.",LatinNameHere,2025-04-24T10:20:23,6
"This is all true.   As the owner of a house built 20 years ago, my lot size is what's keep my home value high.   All of the new construction builds are two story homes built on a tiny lot. I get it, it maximizes the number of homes a developer can build in a given area.   My single story home on almost .3 of an acre with my large pool and private space is far more desirable for a family than having a back yard that's 10 or 15 feet.   Also having your neighbors look from their two story home straight into your kitchen is unsettling.",Legio-V-Alaudae,2025-04-24T10:36:46,10
"Could get you something in VA, depends where though. Mine was 261k, three bedroom; two bath. The one thing, however, is our bid was not countered and the seller wanted it gone. The big issue where I'm at, a transient area; you could easily find yourself in a bidding war with other people offering more money for the house. That also could be your realtor being shady and telling you someone offered a higher price. There's a lot more to the housing market than some might think.",thenovicemechanic,2025-04-24T10:38:20,4
Same rate as you that we refinanced a week before the lockdowns hit.    We have since added another child and have outgrown our current house but giving to that interest rate just doesn't make sense right now.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-24T11:05:31,3
"Got sub 3% and my home exploded over 200k in value in a year.  Yeah I can never leave, I am trapped here lol.  Already made modifications to support my old parents so they can just move in here and I'll go rent a fun condo in the city as they live out their years.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-24T13:07:47,2
" I get that. It’s like that in CA where I grew up at. Same in Vegas in my sisters neighborhood.  I live in the Midwest now - all our new communities being built in my town all have nice sized yards. My back yard is 40x80 ft, the front is just as big minus the driveway for a 3 car garage.",Zachmode,2025-04-24T10:55:46,2
"Sold my house in MA 5 years ago for 160K. City Lot, no lawn to speak of but a 2 car garage. You could turn the lights off in the house and still see clearly enough to read a book. NOISE NOISE NOISE NOISE... boom boom boom. Our house was shot twice by stray gunfire. You get to listen to the bar let out and the idiots walking down the street fighting and arguing.  Bought a house in TN for 150K 1.5 acres, little smaller house, way out in the country. Literally have to drive 45 minutes to get to the nearest shopping plaza and about 15-20 to get to the nearest gas station. Turn the lights off and it is dark enough that you could imagine being blind from lack of light. Brightest light at night is a full moon. The only noise is nature all around me.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T10:44:21,5

> Sold my house in MA 5 years ago for 160K.   western mass? can't imagine anything east of 495 selling that cheap. (also bet you'd be shocked if you looked up the value of it now if that sale was 5 years ago),reaper527,2025-04-24T12:54:49,2
I hate civilization... well the city anyways... a city lot is about an 1/8th of an acre... it sucked.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T12:16:32,1
