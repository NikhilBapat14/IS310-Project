"Sure appears to be the case, it sits on her desk for weeks, and now gets shoved off to the FBI, where to next?",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-09T08:35:10,1115
"Something sure is strange. She wouldn't make a big to do declaring she would publicly release everything the next day and not do it, unless she really intended on doing it. Much easier to not promise and save herself embarrassment.",johndeer89,2025-05-09T08:59:28,403

"Everyone that hates on Jones forgets that he’s been right about things as well.  Yes, he’s definitely not a person I want to have a conversation with.  But here are some times he “called it”:  Mass surveillance. He called it YEARS before Snowden did his leaks.     He called the Epstein ties a decade (or more) before the 2019 arrest.    He called out “human/animal hybrids).  While I’ve not seen proof of the extremes of what he claimed, we have seen human cells be out in to pig embryo.  So… at least half right.    He called out weather modification.  Yes, it was publicly disclosed as early as the 1950s. But back then, you trusted the government, right?  And the science was likely less understood and overall, less known by the masses.  He made it widely known, which in my opinion is a great thing.   He also called out the strangeness of Bohemian Grove about a year before infiltrating a ceremony and filming.   I don’t care if Jones’ demeanor and how he never slows down to really explain himself.  But without nuts like this, no one would be pushing the envelope to get much of this secretive stuff out.  We just have to make our own minds up (and do our own research) to see if it’s actually true.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-09T10:34:44,95

"Im all for entertainment. I don’t mind a little entertainment in my politics either.   But at some point, we have to accept that conspiracy theory entertainment slinging can only go so far.    Do you think DJT and Bondi are really part of a coverup?  Or do you think that there just isnt much to say about Epstein? ",Texas103,2025-05-09T10:35:12,-27
"Thing is, you have to have absolute trust in the people you put on l going through the documents, that inherently heavily restricts the amount of people you can have working on it. I hate that its not been done already, im angry this wasnt done years ago, but im not shocked that the biden admin never went through the documents, or atleast never redacted victim info.   Problem with it is if you start releasing a bit of it, the rest all go into hiding. Creating confusion may help keep some of them in the US confident that documents have either been destroyed or will be hidden. Maybe im giving them too much credit but time will tell.",ultrainstict,2025-05-10T03:11:50,0

"Seems like he is just spitballing nonsense most of the time. Doesn't he owe over a billion dollars to parents of deceased kids for publicly promoting the claim that the murder of their children was fake. Strikes me as a crazy who appeals to the very worst of US, not someone whose antics should be celebrated in anyway whatsoever.",According-Activity87,2025-05-09T10:54:18,296
"Yeah he's super right about those supplements he hocks, child state actors and other countless false claims.  Everyone know Epstein was a sick fuck, there isn't some secret conspiracy there, it's just the reality of how much damage would be done if it turns out he was a FBI/CIA asset.    Going over the JFK files the fact the CIA seriously considered dropping smallpox on Cuba in retaliation to JFK is all kinds of fucked up, so Epstein being an asset would be pretty on point.",Creski,2025-05-09T13:22:58,44
"When you make wild claims and swing for the fences you're bound to be mildly right once in a while.  That said, the damage this man has done to families and to others has been significant.  He makes anyone associated with him look bad.  I wouldn't be surprised if Bondi or someone else in the government is keeping info secret about Epstein.  I'd just rather hear it from someone less likely to inspire someone to grab a gun and invade an innocent pizza joint.",cathbadh,2025-05-09T19:17:33,12

"I think it's fine to demand answers as long as it's unaddressed.  If at some point they explain that it's boring or just names we knew already ... well, we can evaluate the truth then, based on what they say.  But until then, we should demand an explanation.

"Yes, ""they"" have dirt on her too. As well as the thousands of rank and file members of multiple intelligence agencies and the DoJ across multiple administrations that have had access to the master list. Despite this being the leakiest period in history it hasn't leaked. This fact alone just proves the list is real and the fact that it implicates Biden and Trump directly. Almost everyone in the government from left to right, establishment to dissident is likely compromised.  It's definitely this and totally not the possibility that there is no list. That's just preposterous.",cplusequals,2025-05-09T14:15:22,98

"She wasn't Trump's selection she was the establishment's. Trump's selection was Matt Gaetz remember? Reddit had a fit about it and was very happy with Bondi. Wrong as usual. Notice the establishment won't let Trump put his own people at the DOJ? They obstructed his nomination for DC as well I wonder why! Republicans voted for Garland but won't vote for Trump's picks, tells you all you need to know.",day25,2025-05-09T09:22:57,-35
"My question is, was she stopped from releasing the records by someone rich and powerful, or... was it maybe a different twist:  That Trump had her announce that she was going to release the records as part of a negotiation, and once <whomever> complied with Trump's demands, the promise to release the records was forgotten.  ... and then about 45 days later, Bill Gates promises to give away almost all his wealth, with the comment that ""they may say a lot of things about me after I'm dead, but not that I died rich.""  .... Bill Gates, who was swiftly divorced when the whole scandal broke.  purely coincidence, I'm sure.",Papa_Ganda,2025-05-09T14:56:12,-13
"Care to enlighten me? I totally agree with the sentiment, but I don't know about any Epstein and/or Bondi -AIPAC connection",Uncle___Screwtape,2025-05-09T15:20:11,18
"I don’t disagree with you about the spit balling. He certainly seems to do that. And yes, last I checked he owed a massive amount to families, too much in my opinion (but that’s a different conversation).    Either way, he’s probably right again this time with Bondi.  Which is the main reason I made my comment.  Bondi said “There are videos—tens of thousands. Some of them are shocking. Horrifying. The FBI has them. They involve minors.”  We’ve not heard anything useful about that whole case.  Originally we thought we never would because it will likely implicate enormous amounts of leaders (elected and not).  Jones is probably right about this.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-09T11:00:07,2

"I guess put another way… I trust Bondi and DJT for transparency. If there was some kind of deep conspiracy.. I think they would enjoy being the ones to break it to the public.   The truth is that many many people would love to expose the Epstine stuff.. it’s got broad support on both sides of the aisle.   At this point, the truth is probably that there isn’t much to say. Some rich and powerful people banged some young girls/women. Thats horrible. Thats trafficking. Some victims have come forward.   But I don’t know that there is some sort of deeper conspiracy with a list of everything evil done by rich and powerful people lurking out there on Bondis desk. That probably does not exist. ",Texas103,2025-05-09T11:21:18,-23

"I really really don't want to give credence to someone like Alex Jones, but I also really really don't want our reason to be tainted by logical fallacies.  It is true that Jones has made claims that were near impossible to prove. It is true that the bombastic way he speaks lends itself to major problems and if he wants to be taken seriously, he needs to be far more careful with his words. It is true he has made some false claims.  But it is also true that he has been right about many things that few are willing to talk about. It is also true that Jones has explained some of his hyperbole or his weird ways of saying things. Like he should just say ""I suspect there is a pedophile ring. Here is the evidence,"" rather than talking about psychic vampires and shit.  The things he has been right about and the things he has rightfully called out I have never seen any pundits, left or right call out. He was the only person I know of who talked about The Bilderberg Group, and whether it is a devious group of people plotting take over of the world or whether it is just a meeting of very powerful individuals, the people ought to know about it, especially if attendance by our own leaders is not disclosed to the people (which violates certain laws).  He told us about the Chinese social credit score system and he was right. He told us about organ harvesting in China and he was right. He told us about organ harvesting in Africa and he was right. He told us about Bohemian Grove, which the people ought to know about. He uncovered odd details about 9/11, and while he didn't get all the facts, he certainly correctly pointed to some suspicious details of the attack and also how bad the Patriot Act was.  The point is that it is a logical fallacy to discredit the person rather than the argument. That is what people are doing with Jones. He also got supremely fucked over by the courts. He did not get his due process, they just steam rolled him. You can despise him, but he is due a fair trial.",MikeyPh,2025-05-09T10:27:48,14
