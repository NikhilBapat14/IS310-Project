"It starts with AIPAC.  The American Israeli Public Affairs Committee wields outsized political influence because of the amount of cash/influence/votes it can throw around.  They advocate solely for Israel's influence, regardless of [how it will affect democracy in the US](https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/2022-03-08/ty-article/.highlight/truly-horrifying-aipac-criticized-for-endorsing-gop-election-deniers/0000017f-e0d4-d9aa-afff-f9dcaf6b0000) and are not above [using dark money to defeat candidates](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/17/pro-israel-lobby-defeat-democrats-palestinians-2022) that would hold Israel to account for their actions.  There's also the fact that [disagreeing with virtually anything Israel does](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-is-an-antisemite-and-republicans-are-totally-cool-with-it) gets you [branded as an anti-semite](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/05/199-house-republicans-have-embraced-anti-semitism-violence/) by some, which is ridiculous but that's the world we live in apparently.",Dogstar34,2023-06-30T22:30:50,26

"There isn’t unanimous agreement on Israel, but there is a strong consensus. There’s also a strong consensus that Medicare and Social Security shouldn’t be cut. These kinds of issues appeal to voters in both parties. If one party angered those voters, it would give the other a huge advantage.",podcastcritic,2023-07-01T18:31:14,1
"They're the only real democracy in the area, they share many of our values and haven't taken to terror as a State policy even if retaliation to terror looks like it to the uninformed. Also, there already IS a ""Palestinian Homeland"" it;s called JORDAN. The ""homeless refugee"" problem is entirely due to the fact no other country in the region will take them in.",Olderscout77,2023-07-01T18:18:45,0
"The largest reason is because Israel, for all its challenges, is closer to America culturally than is the Arad world. Also, the ancient and modern story of Jews and Israel has strong resonance with millions of Americans, religiously and historically. AIPAC, and similar groups, are largely pushing against a door that is already largely open.",BillyJoeMac9095,2023-07-01T15:21:22,-1
"During Obama's Eight years, Israel looked pretty much on its own.  Conspiracy and scheming are a big part of politics.  Given two or more people came together behind a closed door, and created some sort of plan, that is scheming.  Did someone like a Harry Reid make a plan, behind closed doors, with another person, to lie to and deceive the American People?  That may be Conspiracy.  Article:  [Harry Reid Admits He Lies On The Senate Floor](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/harry-reid-admits-he-lies-senate-floor-joel-gehrke/)  >Even candidates like AOC and Maxwell Frost, who were previously pro-Palestine, were forced to moderate their positions  Behind closed doors they may have been pressured to.  Understanding that Conspiracy has happened may be healthy.  Someone who just trusted everyone may be naive at best.  Conspiracy Theory starts when someone becomes really paranoid or has a ""Pet Conspiracy,"" something they really need to be true.",ManonFire63,2023-07-01T03:51:25,-9
"Re other large diasporas, I’d wager it’s due to the relative success of Jews in industry (= more political influence) compared to other groups",[deleted],2023-07-01T09:44:32,-1
"Yeah, I’m gonna have to disagree with you there chief. It’s not ethical to have 3 million stateless Palestinians under permanent military occupation in the West Bank, and you’re never going to be able to deport them all to Jordan, nor should you.",TheOfficialLavaring,2023-07-01T18:25:17,2

"You mean like the 6.8 Million native Americans we have living in the US today? Yeah, that's a real problem except they never blow up their neighbors and all the woke in the world won't make us guilty now for what someone did then. It's life - live with it.",Olderscout77,2023-07-02T06:14:58,0
Essentially yes. There are more wealthy/prominent Jews relative to other diaspora populations like Japanese or Taiwanese,[deleted],2023-07-01T18:31:20,1

"How's that anti-semitic? If anything, props to Jewish-Americans for being so successful in business",[deleted],2023-07-02T19:39:42,1
Not every group or person who is successful in business has great political clout.  There almost always has to be a base of strong public support first.,BillyJoeMac9095,2023-07-04T09:02:40,3
