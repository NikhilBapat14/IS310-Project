Systemic racism. Republicans are doing all of this after attacking CRT and years of dog whistling.  This is why anyone accusing me of being on the democrats plantation has no fucking clue.  This is also why I don’t think “green is the only color they see” is appropriate. If they’re only “playing racists” they sure do target like they know how to do racism.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-30T12:03:48,9
