"I like Beto, but at a certain point you have to accept that you have the stink of loss on you and that won't go away. The man hasn't won an election in a decade. He withdrew from the 2020 primary before the first vote was cast.  He just doesn't connect with voters.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-28T11:51:50,56
"The way Cornyn is acting right now, I have no doubt Ken Paxton is going to win the primary. He might have an R next to his name, but 60% of the state really has to choke down the vomit when voting for “korruption kenny”. It feels like if the dems could just put out a likable candidate, they should win. I really can’t put into words how abrasive Ken Paxton is. He actively tries to be unlikable because he thinks it’s macho, but he looks and acts like a Bond villain.",Static-Stair-58,2025-04-28T11:58:02,9

"This is what politicians should do.  Not pursue power because it’s their turn or because they want to move on up but they need to put their ear to the ground and ask their soul if they hear the pull of the public, are they being called to serve by the tides of duty and honor?",dbag3o1,2025-04-28T11:58:27,4

"I appreciated that Beto made a point of visiting and campaigning in every county. It was a solid strategy and meaningful for Democrats generally.  I’m neither a Texan nor a gun person, but his “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15” comment seemed to doom any chance he had at winning statewide-office.",Ok-Conversation2707,2025-04-28T12:12:05,23

It's been 80 years since a Democrat won a Senate seat in TX. Hard to blame Beto's likability in the face of those odds. Texans just really hate Democrats.,waxroy-finerayfool,2025-04-28T16:05:09,2
"But honestly,  it's also up to local leadership to fucking plug the obvious election holes. I campaigned for beto even when he was an obvious loser. There is no one in Texas the national party is willing to put their necks out for. Its like the DNC just fucking gave up on Texas and the momentum that's there. I live in colorado now because I'm 100% positive that Texas is ground zero for new Gilead.",Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-04-28T16:37:20,2
Idk how the guy who said he’s “coming for your AR-15” keeps losing in Texas. Can’t imagine why. But sure Dems let’s run him again!!!!,Romano16,2025-04-28T12:25:35,2
At one point he told Texans he would take their guns. They won’t forget. He’s just a two time loser now.,EnvironmentalClue218,2025-04-28T18:43:37,1
"I like Beto too, especially his promise to run for people, not corporations. In fact, I heavily campaigned for him in 2018: letter writing, call/text banks, canvassing. I got ""deputized"" in Texas to register voters. He lost to Cruz, but not by much.  Cornyn stated he wouldn't run if Beto was going to be his competition, and he would have a decent chance for that seat.   But, instead, he ran for President?!   Think of where we might be if he had flipped that one seat in the Senate",eperry79,2025-04-28T23:59:17,1
That's because Texas no longer run fair elections. The state has become a banana republic.,SeductiveSunday,2025-04-28T12:13:30,5
"The Republicans put up a likeable candidate to primary him, and Dems put up a likeable candidate to compete when he won the primary.  People didn't bother to even care - they like the direction he is going in. Corruption is ok",HopeFloatsFoward,2025-04-28T12:45:17,2
"The last time Beto ran against Ted, it was before the power grid failure. I can’t actually explain why Ted won, since literally no one likes the man, but Beto was successful in getting enough people out to vote that it managed to flip a lot of down ballot elections. So, it wasn’t a total failure.   Beto then ran for governor and lost against Greg (also don’t know how this happened, Greg is somehow worse than Ted). In the last senate race, Ted was up against Allred.",otherwisesad,2025-04-28T12:30:49,9

I mean a democratic senator was elected in Alabama and 2 in Georgia in the past 10 years ? Like. There always a shot since there’s only two parties ? Like a Republican was elected in mass in 2009.

"For Alabama, Doug Jones squeaked out a win against a child molester, then lost reelection by 20 points.   For Georgia, the state was solid blue going back to the 1800s and only became purple in the 2000s. For Warnock, he barely won against Herschel Walker in 2022. Ossoff was as close as it gets in 2021. Both Senators had to win in run-offs.     Do they always have a shot? Yes. But when you keep running a guy who loses, your chances drop significantly.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-28T12:04:02,2

"He grew up in a town that had a large shooting during a prior election he was in... And he got asked about it, and in a moment of passion, he screamed he was gonna take away guns. And Texans love guns more than basically anything. So it dropped his polling pretty badly in the moment, but honestly people largely overblow it, he still performed about as well as originally expected.",UngodlyPain,2025-04-28T15:34:38,3

"Biden didn't keep running for president. He ran in 1988, then again in 2008, and between those elections, he kept winning reelections in the Senate, which keeps that loser stink off you.   2008 led to him being Veep, then he ran again in 2020 and won.      And Reagan ran for president in 76 and almost won the primary, which had to go to an open convention, then he won in 81. No stink there.",PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-28T12:17:46,1

"No, it's mostly people brought up in an incredibly conservative culture who then bring up their kids in that same culture.  Texas republicans have also successfully managed to blame every stupid thing they do on democrats, Californians, New Yorkers, and various others while taking credit for the good parts of living in Texas, most of which existed before they were ever fucking born.  My original comment was overly pessimistic, Texas can change and IS changing, but so slowly that I don't know if I'll see it in my lifetime.",NewDovah,2025-04-28T21:43:29,2

But make sure all those indoctrinated hold ALL THE POWER based on imaginary lines the PEOPLE IN POWER draw… well you only have half the work to do in any subsequent endeavors (de-facto segregated education, red lining, Jim Crow, etc.), and twice or thrice the minds to corrupt (based on adolescent and maternal survival rates).

"He didn't ""run"" in 68, he was part of the ""Stop Nixon"" movement, where a number of Republicans worked to help Rockerfeller by pulling votes from Nixon in the South (it clearly didn't work well enough).
