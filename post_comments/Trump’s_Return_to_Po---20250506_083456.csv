"I have a conspiracy theory.   I believe that the richest man in the world bought the most popular direct advertising platform on the plant and turned it into a right-wing propaganda network in order to get people to vote for a third-rate criminal.    I believe that this criminal is not fit to be president, but because he was propped up by this oligarch and other Russian propaganda, he was able to use our broken electoral college system to get a win, and now that he is president, he is doing his damndest to destroy the country from within.   I think that this convicted criminal that wears to much orange makeup has been a Russian asset since the 1980's and is currently  activetly destroying our economy on Putins orders.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-06T08:44:08,47
I truly believe him and an unknown number of elected officials are either being paid by Russia or have blackmail on them to sabotage the country. It's the only thing that truly makes sense in this bizarre mess of elected officials.  The end goal is unclear but it's clear as day in the short term the mission is to destabilize the country.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-06T08:38:03,19
"The election was bought and paid for by the wealthiest individuals in the country.  Trump left office with a 37% approval rating and then became the come-back king with the lowest approval rating (besides Nixon) and won the first popular vote for a Republican candidate in 20 years since Bush in 2004. AND won all 7 swing states, which hasn't happened in 40 years. One monumental election event I could have believed, but two makes it a coup.  https://electiontruthalliance.org/",Financial-Special766,2025-05-06T09:18:42,4

"> I believe that the richest man in the world bought the most popular direct advertising platform on the plant and turned it into a right-wing propaganda network in order to get people to vote for a third-rate criminal.  That sounds like an original idea, but that guy doesn’t have a proven track record for originality. It’s also something someone marginally smart thought up, but he isn’t so he probably didn’t.  I think being forced to buy twitter displayed rather publicly his endless need for attention & validation to fill up the void where his personality isn’t. It’s pathetic how trivial it is. Costs only the entry fee for access, and once in, obsequiously fanning their ego gets them to do whatever you want.",BrujaSloth,2025-05-06T09:52:19,2
"I agree. And there's always a target for MAGA. Of course, there's always the target of immigration.  But back in 2016 the target of the republican party was the BLM movement. In 2024, the new target was trans people or LGBTQ+  These people are just vile cretins",inactivemember99,2025-05-06T08:46:55,10
"End goal is unclear? He's turning the USA into the 4th Reich/USSR 2. And immigrants, LGBTQ and Democrats are either going to leave, be deported or executed. He only wants oligarchs to rule and take over the land when his peasants lose their homes. And don't forget he wants all of North America, greenland and Mexico.  This is literally project 25.",unicornsfearglitter,2025-05-06T09:03:53,2
