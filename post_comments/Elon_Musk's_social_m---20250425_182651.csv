Ask Virginia about their battle flag.,AnalTongueDarts,2025-04-26T10:01:00,2
"Yeah, I think the Muskrats hit report on a lot of posts that are critical of Musk. I got hit with a temp ban that got reversed by a mod when I appealed it.   I have a feeling that there’s some sort of automation that  parses the reported posts and if it finds something that looks like it might be threatening violence, the posting account gets a temp ban. The appeals go to an actual person.   So a post that gets reported that is quoting Musk talking about doing something violent will get the temp ban because the automation can’t really pick up on the nuance of a post.",wwhsd,2025-04-26T01:14:50,1
"Hadn’t seen it so far. I suspects it was strong words or swear words. Beside Trump and MAGA are easily breaking the rules on spamming, trolling, personal attacks, and on.",Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-25T19:13:29,1
You should see Quora or Newsbreak app. MAGA are totally out of control on there. And with Elon Musk there’s a ton of information about him supporting Republicans party from 2017 onward so it don’t violates the rules of Reddit. Apparently he voted for Biden but encouraging violences or death threats are against the rules.,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-25T19:18:14,1
