We're about to find out what's more important to MAGA; Trump enabling them to spew their racist shit or having enough income to cover their basic day to day needs.   And it's still too close to call.,biscuitarse,2025-04-30T07:14:25,30

wait till the real pain hits in a couple weeks. Empty shelves and sky rocketing prices for months and months.  The Magas did this,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-30T07:50:19,4
Too late. You had your chance and you made your choice. Enjoy the economic pain. You wanted pain for other people. You thought that would be funny. No sympathy. FAFO.,Madmandocv1,2025-04-30T07:37:02,6

I'm from Georgia and believe me when I say that some of the toothless methhead fucks that live here would gladly choose open racism and blame brown and black people for the situation they're in.,RefrigeratorNo1160,2025-04-30T08:23:26,9

They cemented their own public pools rather than have to share them with a black person.  They'd rather shut down their own schools and teach their children at home rather than share them with a black person.  It's self inflicted.  And at some point I'm tired of trying to save them.,Federal_Drummer7105,2025-04-30T10:15:51,3
Unfortunately for my country it’s the economy that is the only reason many will break with Trump.,hmr0987,2025-04-30T15:05:58,1
Like Donald Trump himself when he campaigned on putting high tariffs on everything.,Deinosoar,2025-04-30T07:10:15,3
But how else will they be able to spew their hate!?! Bunch of idiots,LeoDeLarge,2025-04-30T07:56:13,5
I feel like that is part of the plan. He wants us all hungry and hurting so we are willing to fight a war for him. Populations need deep unrest to want to fight.,Book_bae,2025-04-30T09:39:01,3

"""Well they did actually vote for that.""  So now he's telling them ""Oh you guys out there who say 'I didn't vote for that like higher prices and American citizen children with cancer being thrown out of the country-'  ""Well actually you did vote for that.""

I think ginning up violence at protests this summer followed by a declaration of Martial Law in perpetuity is the Project 2025 plan.,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-30T10:08:23,2
