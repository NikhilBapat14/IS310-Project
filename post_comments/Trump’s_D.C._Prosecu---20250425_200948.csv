"Gonna take an unpopular stance here and say this is the wrong tactic to tackle the wrong problem.   Bias on Wikipedia perpetrated by the community editors doesn't have anything to do with the organization's tax status, and it makes exactly zero sense to fight fire with... taxation?  Wikipedia has little cliques of editors that control certain articles, and the proper thing to do is break up those cliques by beating them at their own game.  None of which has to do with weaponizing the tax code.  Wikipedia is (generally) a bright spot in a cesspool of AI generated or branded/advertising/sales content that dominates the web. As a whole, it needs to be nurtured and protected, even if parts of it veer off course - which should be corrected tactically/surgically - not bludgeoned with a blunt instrument.",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-27T12:23:20,5

"Good they do nothing to prevent brigading and political weaponization. It takes a trivial amount of time for the left to bombard wikis of current events with outright lies. Such as most recently the artical on kilmar abrego garcia, which initially insisted he was a US citizen, then was changed to legal permenant residence. Ecen now it outright lies about the determination that he is a member of ms13, with no mention of the immigration court determining he was a member of ms13, and does not mention that the decision was upheld on appeal, resulting in his final order of deportation.   Or less recently, insisting that the assassination attempts on donald trump wer fake/staged. Then that they were perpetrated by right wing extremists, and still contains a substantial amount of spin.",ultrainstict,2025-04-26T08:06:06,5
Nice. Just read Trumps intro on there. The bias is insane. Hope this happens or they clean up their act.,MichaelSquare,2025-04-26T07:25:07,2
