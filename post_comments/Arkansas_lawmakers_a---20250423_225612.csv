"Man this is wild.  45 comments and only 2 showing.  But yeah, as someone living in the Midwest, it sure has seemed active this year so far, and we haven't even hit what is considered our severe season yet.  That's May typically.  There could still be much more to come in the coming months.  I can't remember the last time I ever heard of a disaster declaration being denied from something like this.  Maybe it's the fact that, according to the listed article, that the damage estimate so far only came to $8.8 million?  I'm not sure how they gauge the acceptance of those declarations.",ponmbr,2025-04-24T09:01:11,98
"Excuse me if this is insensitive but there are multiple tornadoes every month in Arkansas, is the fed government supposed to foot the bill every single time they cause damage?Â    Florida finally got the picture and started building things strong enough to withstand the constant hurricanes, now they don't get completely annihilated every season. Tornado Alley needs to get with the program.",aliislam_sharun,2025-04-24T04:47:38,-151
"Arkansas -and that portion of the midwest- has been hit **unnaturally hard** this year. While tornadoes *do* strike commonly, this year has been particularly active for an area of the country stretching from Arkansas to Illinois, particularly along the Mississippi River areas.  Denying them aid in this case because tornadoes hit every year would be like denying Florida aid from Milton or Helene because hurricanes hit every year.",upon_a_white_horse,2025-04-24T07:02:18,348
"Not to mention, with a hurricane you get a week of notice to board everything down. Several of the tornados in Arkansas hit in the middle of the night with little to no notice.",woodm872,2025-04-24T09:09:23,136
"Middle of the night, rain-wrapped, ""spin up"" (but I suppose that falls under 'little to no notice'), etc. I don't think the person I responded to is familiar with how difficult it is to accurately predict severe weather, much less tornadoes. Even in tornado alley, where I live, its rare to get any more than 15 minutes worth of warning ahead of a tornado that's actually moving towards you. There's talks of model data and whatnot, and while it helps, it doesn't predict exact location and instead gives likelihoods-- a key factor of which really isn't available more than 48 hours ahead of the event.  I can't help but wonder where the person I replied to lives in relation to the type of weather he/she receives, especially with their hinting at building tornado-proof residences. Few people can afford to build a home capable of withstanding 100mph/161kph wind gusts (for an EF1; the scale tops out at EF5 with winds greater than 200mph/322kph).  An EF5 tornado is capable of **ripping asphalt off of roadways** as evidenced by the [2011 Rainsville, AL tornado](https://youtu.be/BCBCTIHTzPw?si=-CURT3uhs_U6VosV).",upon_a_white_horse,2025-04-24T09:35:07,63
