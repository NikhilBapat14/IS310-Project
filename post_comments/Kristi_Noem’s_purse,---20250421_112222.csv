"I‚Äôd hate to be that dude, if it were you or me we‚Äôd be screwed, but for her they‚Äôre going to be combing through every piece of CCTV footage in existence until they find this twat",Chapped_Assets,2025-04-21T12:16:48,663
Is it usual to carry that much cash plus your passport on a random night out?,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-04-21T11:30:55,675
"Bad look for the Secret Service. The New York Post is reporting that the purse was underneath her chair. She felt something brush against her leg and thought it was one of her grandkids, and then the purse was gone. So the guy got very close. Scary. I hope it was a random thief who got the shock of his life when he realized who he had messed with -- but with all these stories about Signal chats and deep state leaks I can't help wondering if this was targeted.",MrsKiwi66,2025-04-21T15:17:45,58
"So Secret Service provides security for cabinet level politicians. WTF is going on here SS? One failure after another.  I think the major takeaway here is that Trump and others are probably in a lot more real danger than we like to think, even under SS control.",GeneticsGuy,2025-04-21T12:45:49,126

"Hahah I‚Äôm really starting to Like This Gal. She rocks a Rolex Daytona to a Prison in South America and her having $3,000 Cash in her Bag is Baller and very American of her",Oscarwilder123,2025-04-21T14:00:52,-26
"You know this dope is gonna be looking through the passport going ""Who the fuck is Kristi Noem? Let me Google that shit...Oh fuc..."" just before SWAT crash through his windows.",WPWeasel,2025-04-21T13:35:12,219
"Good. It'd be nice if normal robberies could be looked into more, but this should definitely get specific attention. We need to know if she was targeted deliberately, and her security detail needs to examine their actions too.",Hrendo,2025-04-21T14:06:27,55
The DC police is run by democrats so probably not. Also republicans are the ones who want to be tough on crime it's dems who enable this because they know they will be protected in their ivory towers and with their two tiered system of justice.,day25,2025-04-21T14:23:20,-23
Usual when you're the Secretary of DHS. Not usual for it to be somewhere where someone can just snatch it.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-21T11:56:12,208
It depends on if she might have to hop on a plane randomly to go handle something like an emergency.,3DoorsOfKryptonite,2025-04-21T11:41:09,163
If she was planning on traveling or had just arrived it would make sense to have her passport in hand. I assume she travels a lot or may have to leave at a moments notice so it may make sense just to keep it with her.¬†   And $3000 in cash really isn't that much these days if you are someone who pays cash instead of credit.¬†,Material-Afternoon16,2025-04-21T12:11:07,58
">‚ÄúHer entire family was in town, including her children and grandchildren ‚Äî she was using the cash withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts,‚Äù DHS said in a statement.",Rush_Is_Right,2025-04-21T19:39:05,12
About as usual as Hawaiian\_Pizza.,Right_Archivist,2025-04-21T11:33:07,6
"Passport is required unless you have Real ID now for flying (not sure if she flies exclusively private or not), though she could use her DHS badge, however if she needed to travel outside the country she would need it.  The cash, I don't really have an answer but she has a good amount of money?  Idk if 3k in DC goes super far or not, she might not like using cards and prefer the privacy of cash.",-spartacus-,2025-04-21T15:19:59,1
"That's not that much cash, really. I mean it's a lot for a regular person, but these are rich folks.  I'm surprised they even mentioned the money, because I think if I were a multi millionaire I'd probably always have at least that much on me.",therin_88,2025-04-21T13:47:36,-3
And the DHS badge.   Why carry that when you're not at work? Unless the restaurant gives discounts to federal employees ü§î,Ironman650,2025-04-21T12:09:38,-56

For what purpose?  I can't think of any reason I could ever need more than 2-300 in cash at any given time.  Even with extensive international travel credit cards are so much easier and you can use them almost anywhere.,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-04-21T16:56:51,28
The Secretary of DHS doesn't work a 9-5. She's probably in the office routinely after dinner time.,[deleted],2025-04-21T12:48:51,35
"Bruh   At this level it's a literal 24/7 365 job.    There is no real off time, and she can LITERALLY get a fuckin text and be taking off to go around the world at the drop of the hat     I'm  more curious she doesn't warrant a driver/security guard",spezeditedcomments,2025-04-21T13:40:59,23
"A little different, but the company I work for does a lot of Federal jobs and we get contracting badges. Depending on the staff, they are either kept in their work bag, at their office desk, in their cars, or just at home until needed. Really depends on preference and which makes the most sense for when you would need to use them. So, I get having your badge in like a bag/purse even when you are on the weekends.",War-Damn-America,2025-04-21T12:32:32,14
"She most likely works 24/7 randomly, and sometimes all hours of the night. Discounts have absolutely nothing to do with it.",3DoorsOfKryptonite,2025-04-21T13:21:32,9
