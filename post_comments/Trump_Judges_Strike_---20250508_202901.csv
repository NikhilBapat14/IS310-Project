"Hey MAGA, opposing a racially drawn map is not woke.  Instead, it is being a decent human being.",ResidentKelpien,2025-05-08T20:39:01,127
"So the ELI5 of this is:  1) Alabama is racist as hell 2) 2020 census happens, showing Alabama has 7 districts (no change from 2010 census) 3) However, the racial makeup of the districts imposed following redistricting in early 2021 for the 2022 election are challenged as being a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; in essence, because the group responsible for redistricting forced all democrats into one district rather than evenly spreading the population in a more equitable fashion that would permit black voters in Alabama a better chance of electing representatives such as themselves (in essence) 4) this lawsuit makes its way up to SCOTUS, who do not issue a ruling in time for anything to take effect, with the **resulting 2022 election cycle going 6-1 (Rep-Dem)** 5) in June 2023, SCOTUS rules that Alabama *did* legally disenfranchise minority voters based on the 2021 map, and ruled the state legislature **had** to redraw the map for the 2024 election in a manner that would be likely to permit 2 minority districts 6) Alabama legislature said “suck it” and failed to comply with SCOTUS 7) Alabama gets sued again, district and circuit courts say Alabama failed to comply with SCOTUS, SCOTUS does not hear appeal 8) Special Master is appointed by the federal district court who draws more or less adequate maps for 2024 election cycle, resulting in two minority majority or plurality districts; **result - 2024 election cycle 5-2 (Rep-Dem)** 9) ~~racists~~ *people who feel that a state with 25% African American population should only have (maybe) 1 African American representative out of the nine sent to Congress from the state is equitable* sue to either reimpose the 2021 map or permit the legislature to draw a fourth map 10) district court panel (including two Trump appointees) agree the 2023 map was crazy racist and flouted an order from SCOTUS",BriefausdemGeist,2025-05-08T22:06:03,60

"Discussion of preclearance requirements here is very interesting given SCOTUS' decision in Shelby v Holder. That decision was based upon the nature of the formula determining the geographic application of preclearance requirements per the VRA and how it didn't reflect ""current conditions.""   This panel has suggested current conditions reflect something different altogether - a purposeful, bad faith effort to disenfranchise black voters with a non-compliant state legislature failing to uphold rulings seeking to provide said voters with a remedy.  The future hearings described here will be worth watching.",OldTobyGreen,2025-05-09T09:20:36,1
And now the courts will stall until after the midterms and then SCOTUS will ultimately accept the old maps.,TexasInsights,2025-05-09T09:32:22,1

Being a decent human being is considered woke now.,TranquilSeaOtter,2025-05-08T20:46:58,58
"their movement is about power and domination over designated ‘others’, appeals to decency don’t mean anything to them",Disgruntled-Cacti,2025-05-08T21:47:36,13
"Here's the thing, though. It absolutely is woke. That's literally what it means. It means that you are aware that systemic injustice exists and can recognize the places it creates inequality.    And that is a decent thing to be.",somethin_brewin,2025-05-09T06:13:01,4
Honestly surprised they didn't just completely tell the court to kick rocks and pass a 7R-0D map. Pretty simple from a mathematical/geographical standpoint.,hunter15991,2025-05-08T22:38:18,13
As surely as if Bill Murray had said it.,random_anonymous_guy,2025-05-09T00:18:46,1
that's how you know they are actually fascists.,_thetommy,2025-05-09T06:45:44,10
It was probably too challenging to pack 25% across all 7 with maps that didn't just like cross state zigzags. But dammit you know they tried.,alabasterskim,2025-05-09T00:15:43,8
"It really isn't though - as someone who sometimes fiddles with map drawers when I'm bored, [this](https://davesredistricting.org/join/0229ae11-c0c2-4ec3-9af9-d70bc492ff66) took me under 5 minutes. The three closest districts were Tuberville+7.4/Trump'20+12/Trump'24+16.8, Tuberville+8.6/Trump'20+12.8/Trump'24+15.8, and Tuberville+7.9/Trump'20+11.9/Trump'24+18.1. Could probably get the Tuberville margins all into the double digits with a bit more time splitting Birmingham three ways and possibly Montgomery two ways, which can be done without going all tendril-y.  EDIT: [2nd attempt](https://davesredistricting.org/join/b292e3bb-3fae-4284-92b8-6c9473741d59), also about 5 minutes, closest district is Tuberville+13.3.",hunter15991,2025-05-09T00:35:16,5
Well then I guess Alabama GOP isn't too bright. Send this into them.,alabasterskim,2025-05-09T06:46:44,1
