"Wait until they witch hunt Rubio for past things he said about Trump.  Once they get everyone else, he is next.",Familiar-Ad-9370,2025-05-01T21:19:13,36
I really hate this timeline.,snoopyh42,2025-05-01T22:00:54,30
Rubio sold out. And for what. Trump will dump him before his term is up if he gets in the way.,baby_budda,2025-05-02T01:06:52,19
I thought Rubio didn’t like Alex Jones,JoshiKousei,2025-05-01T23:33:09,10
![gif](giphy|5R2XVoMUnUmhxX5dWI|downsized)  That’s going to be a looooooooooooooong investigation.,Wise-Lawfulness2969,2025-05-02T01:36:20,6
"Rubio doesn't like himself. What a complete and utter sellout. He lacks integrity and spine. He's like a character in a Shakespearean tragedy. His demise is pathetic, and we are watching it unfold during  open mic at Trump's ridiculous cabinet meetings.",Notkissedbyfire,2025-05-02T03:33:41,4
Alex Jones pissed me off with Sandy Hook. He said he was wrong.,sydbarrettallright,2025-05-01T21:28:15,4

"And what, exactly, does criticism of Alex Jones have to do with either the State Department or national security? Spoiler alert: nothing. Fuck Little Marco. And fuck his boss.  https://preview.redd.it/f9aeomfhvdye1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd6b98c46822d2973de022401cb723cfab165cb6",dantekant22,2025-05-02T10:01:44,2
What sane person doesn't criticize Alex Jones?,hairless_resonder,2025-05-02T11:26:05,2
This tells exactly who they all are.   Disgusting that they love Alex Jones like this!,indigopedal,2025-05-04T09:32:29,2
"It’s unbelievable that this has become ok to them. They disagree with EVERYTHING that we stand for. They HATE the people that we listen to in the media. But you know what, I guarantee you that if you asked any democrat they would say that everyone’s opinion has a place at the table. It’s part of what makes this country truly FREE. Being tolerant of other view points.   Eventually, this side WILL get tired of it and they WILL eventually feel like if your opinion is to be against freedom then maybe you DONT deserve a place at the table",Naptasticly,2025-05-02T05:32:14,1
The fact that they are focusing on this instead of actual stuff is probably a good thing,Rosebunse,2025-05-02T05:58:36,1

He didn't like Putin either.   Now he'll suck off Putin if Trump tells him to.,Megalodon481,2025-05-02T00:25:36,18
"Wait, he pissed you off because he admitted he was wrong?",snoopyh42,2025-05-01T22:00:37,3
They can still do actual bad stuff while pursuing petty grudges and purges.,Megalodon481,2025-05-02T19:43:41,2
I really hate that he would question that it happened. Crisis Actors and all. He only admitted he was wrong on Organs show because he had no proof. He would have maintained same narrative if he hadn't been exposed,sydbarrettallright,2025-05-01T22:05:09,6
He only begrudgingly admitted the massacre happened because he got sued for defamation and had to testify under penalty of perjury.,Megalodon481,2025-05-01T22:21:49,7
Thank you for clarifying.,snoopyh42,2025-05-01T22:06:41,1
I'm still really sensitive about Sandy Hook after all these years.,sydbarrettallright,2025-05-01T22:25:33,3
