"This should terrify *everyone*. It basically gives police and federal agents a ton of new powers ‚Äî and removes a lot of the limits that normally protect people from abuse. It shields police from being held accountable if they hurt or kill someone while ‚Äúdoing their job,‚Äù and gives them free legal defense through the government. It also allows the military to hand over weapons, gear, and personnel to local police departments, so they‚Äôre essentially turning regular police into militarized forces. Even more concerning, it orders the Justice Department to end or undo court oversight of police departments that have a history of violence or corruption. Getting rid of them means there‚Äôs almost no accountability left. On top of that, it threatens to punish local leaders who don‚Äôt cooperate with Trump‚Äôs agenda.

"> Since returning to office, Trump has made ""law and order"" a central focus of his administration, criticizing cities he claims have restricted policing through equity-driven reforms.  For decades, Republicans have been using ""law and order"" rhetoric as thinly veiled dog whistles meant to inflame racial tensions, scapegoat minorities, immigrants and marginalized groups, and raise concerns around black and brown crime in their neighborhoods.  As of late, MAGA has been using this type of incendiary rhetoric to escalate their culture wars and appeal to conservative's long list of grievances.  These grievances are often unfounded, paranoid and/or phobic. Republicans exploit their voter's fears in order to distract them from the party's failures, instead directing their attention towards all of the imminent, perceived threats to *their* rights and freedoms, *their* race and religion, *their* culture, *their* country, and their white, Christian hegemony.    This not only incites hostility towards out-groups, but also helps Republicans justify their discriminatory attitudes and oppressive policies aimed at foreigners, marginalized individuals, political opponents, Muslims, the media, American institutions, the LGBTQ community, Universities, student protestors, scientists, teachers and librarians, and the list goes on and on.  They even target diverse viewpoints and antithetical ideas and perspectives  By identifying these enemies and scapegoats, they can rally their supporters into a patriotic frenzy, uniting them against all of these common threats to their exclusive, American way of life. This is their unifying cause. They are the *true* patriots and are thus entitled to rights, freedoms, privileges and immunities that other *false,* anti-Americans are not.  ""Law and order"" becomes a means to an end. Authoritarian and fascistic regimes are obsessed with crime and punishment, and they conveniently get to dictate what falls under the purview of ""criminal behavior.""  They begin to categorize all forms of opposition and opposing beliefs as radical, as some kind of widespread epidemic, as undermining the strongman's limitless authority, as a threat to their way of life, as an existential danger to the nation.  From there, practically any action can be justified in the name of ""saving the country.""  This even includes the use of military force to punish and crush dissent, to eliminate diametric and diverse viewpoints, and with the broader goal in mind of gaining a stranglehold on all of their enemies that seem to be lurking around every corner.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-29T15:34:30,17

They aren't really trained or equipped, nor do they have the authorities that police officers would have to do police work.  They could do stuff like, keep people from looting and vandalizing stuff during a state of emergency, block roads during evacuations, move huge numbers of people and supplies, help clear debris. What they can't do is hand out tickets, pull people over, file police reports, run people's IDs and license plates, conduct criminal investigations on civilians.

"Look if he wanted martial law nothing could stop him the 9/11 Patriot act made that absolutely possible with no way to stop it and that wasn't Trump that was America post 9/11 via The Bush administration. It's still a valid set of laws. If he decides, really if anyone in power of anymore thru the chain of command declares anyone, be it person, organization, corporation , anything and anyone  declared terrorist and that's a wrap they no longer are bound by any rules. None, the second they are declared terrorist that's a wrap. They are no longer protected by any of the rights or liberty everyone takes for granted. Like everyone's thoughts and feelings I've just got done reading, for example. Truthfully, most of these comments, as far as  that piece of legislation is concerned, could be considered ü§î  acts of terrorism. Now, I might not be entirely correct, but I know the base of what I'm saying is absolutely true. I know that the Patriot Act is still in full effect. It's how he just recently went about deporting all those MS 13 and all the others he's deported so swiftly. It's how he's probably gonna do a lot of other things as well. I mean, think about it. Can he not? Really, he's gotta know when his term is over. All the enemies he's made are gonna come after him. He's gotta know that he's pissed alota people off. Only way to make sure they don't come after him is to make sure they can't ever. Personally, I say go Trump about time someone does something to shake off all this dead weight and stop letting our country be the laughing stock it has became. We cut our dead ends so our hair will grow longer, just like we trim our trees and plants of dead leaves and branches. We do this because we know it's the only way to promote new growth.  Besides everyone's stuck focusing on this when we have a astroid bigger than the ones that took the dinosaurs out head right at us supposed to come closer to us than our own satellites that orbit our planet do.

What I do know is it's coming and we've known about it for 100s if not thousands of years but here we are talking about this and not preparing for that but I guess it is what it is till it ain't. ü§∑  Ty for listening and sorry if i offended anyone and for everyone that decides to pick apart what I'm saying. Have fun with it cuz I'm not saying what I'm saying is facts besides the fact that 1. Things needed to drastically change in America and fast 2. The Patriot Act is a real thing and folks should pay real close attention to the things we take for granted as they could be taken and nothing anyone can do about it if they are. 3. We do have an astroid headed straight at us it will be here April 2029. 4. The covid virus did do something to our lungs and it did alter our very DNA. 5.

"comments like these really help the argument, that trump needed to happen and  People need to understand this same mentality is why nothing has truly changed. A democracy is  a govt of/for and by the people, but when everyone is expecting someone else to take care of it, then the people are no longer  running  the govt;  change  starts to move  at a snails pace,  laws become antiquated Representatives of the people eventually fail to do right by the people because  People  expect someone else to do it. If not the people then who will choose? whoever that may be, They will continue  use that opportunity  to keep their own  representation in key positions  and soon  you will find that  Exploitation will  remain unnoticed and  Enforcement by  and for the people will  go  unappreciated,   and shadowed by   the growing  enforcement  that is against the people.   The people who will slowly begin to resent the government and expect someone else to take care of these problems, will somehow continue to expect a democracy,  from other people.People at most want a democracy but only seem to  put in effort to vote for 1 person every four years, and only care enough to assume that 1 person is liable for everything, and yet also expect  to live in a democracy.

Undue violence and oppression at the hands of the state will royally backfire on this administration so fast they'll have whiplash. Of course it's heartbreaking that innocent citizens are likely going to be casualties themselves, unnecessarily so, due to these soulless, craven ghouls. They don't understand that they don't have the numbers and the numbers against them grow each day. Even if they deputized the MAGA dipshits to ""brown shirt"" this, they still would fail. It'll be some intense, short-term violence followed by a very brutal and strong rebuke by the citizens against this administration, law enforcement, and any parties acting in support of or on behalf of these fascists. People are already feeling economic pain, at their wits end, and this is before the tariff effects, massive inflationary spikes, and supply chain disruptions have fully impacted the economy. Dogpile undue oppression on top of that and people are going to reach their breaking point, ***fast***.   The big screw up, as usual, is the total fundamental lack of understanding from Trump and company of what allows authoritarians to cement their power and curry public support. Conditions have to be bad prior to power acquisition and public endorsement. Authoritarians need to provide some short-term, usually high profile relief from said bad conditions. They need to have easy to understand and at least vanity-evident plans in place and well communicated to maintain public support through the process. Trump has taken a not wholly comfortable, but still functioning economy, made it so much worse, and done so in such a laughably bad and obvious way that even unengaged laypeople are noticing and becoming motivated. His plans, strategies, and rhetoric are beyond dumb and ineffective, even before they're carried out.

"They're boiling it with one of those super hot burners that can flashboil water in under a minute. It's been 100 days tomorrow. Weve already started openly discussing deport g US citizens to foreign jails, putting the autistic population on a list, making it illegal to criticize the administration, and now we're discussing using the military to bolster policing of the civilian population. We're about 2 weeks from massive supply chain destabilization which will lead to about 2 months of general food and sundries shortages in the best case scenario, and longer in any scenario where things don't go back to the previous status quo. This will occur with mass layoffs and a general recession.  Boiling the frog slowly would involve a gradual eroding of rights over years. Slowly letting people get used to eggs being more expensive, but not toilet paper or diapers. Then toilet paper, then diapers. And not having retirement get zeroed out while that happens.  I think what we are seeing right now is everyone getting ready for the oh shit people are going to realize what's happening moment. The moment the shelves are empty, people are going to start getting laid off, and too much strain on the unemployment system is actually going to cause a lot of state to not be able to pay out. And they've already started a weaning down Medicare and Welfare, they want to hit Social Security too. Once you take away everyone's money, and food isn't just expensive, it's not available, you have a very angry population and they are going to blame someone. And you can say it was the last guy's fault but none of this happened until you were there, and you have spent the last 2 years saying it's the fault of whoever's in charge because they have a magical button that they can push to fix everything. Someone's going to say why haven't you pushed the button and the wind they're told I'm going to push it in 2 weeks, that's not going to work. Because they're hungry and broke now.

"Private gun ownership is not a problem for authoritarians: that‚Äôs not how violent revolutionary groups are armed, nor is it how a large scale uprising would occur. In fact, more firearms is a good thing for them because it means greater instability overall which they can use to climb higher in power, or their own paramilitary groups can be more heavily armed which can help them subdue protests when they take power.  Hitler encouraged gun ownership about Germans. He banned Jews from owning guns sure, but these people were 1% of Germany: not a serious threat even if they were all armed. Stopping them from owning guns was moreso keeping in line with his laws keeping them out of all public life than anything.

"> We were keeping our eye on 1984. When the year came and the prophecy didn‚Äôt, thoughtful Americans sang softly in praise of themselves. The roots of liberal democracy had held. Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.  > But we had forgotten that alongside Orwell‚Äôs dark vision, there was another‚Äîslightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley‚Äôs vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.  > What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ‚Äúfailed to take into account man‚Äôs almost infinite appetite for distractions.‚Äù In 1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us.

Legal Defense of Law Enforcement Officers.  The Attorney General shall take **all appropriate action** to create a mechanism to provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.  This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers.  Don't see anything about a ""report"" here... just taking ""all appropriate action"".   > Sec. 3.  Empowering State and Local Law Enforcement.  (a) The Attorney General and other appropriate heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall **take all appropriate action** to maximize the use of Federal resources to: (i)    provide new best practices to State and local law enforcement to aggressively police communities against all crimes; (ii)   expand access and improve the quality of training available to State and local law enforcement; (iii)  increase pay and benefits for law enforcement officers; (iv)   strengthen and expand legal protections for law enforcement officers;  (v)    seek enhanced sentences for crimes against law enforcement officers; (vi)   promote investment in the security and capacity of prisons; and (vii)  increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions.

Looks like a report at first but its just an order for the AG to review all the agreements we've made and get rid of the ones we don't like.   > Sec. 4.  Using National Security Assets for Law and Order.  (a)  Within 90 days of the date of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the heads of agencies as appropriate, **shall increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions** to assist State and local law enforcement.

This looks reportish.  > Sec. 5.  Holding State and Local Officials Accountable. The Attorney General shall **pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures** to enforce the rights of Americans impacted by crime and shall **prioritize prosecution** of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to State and local jurisdictions whose officials: (a)  willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties necessary for public safety and law enforcement; or     (b)  unlawfully engage in discrimination or civil-rights violations under the guise of ‚Äúdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äù initiatives that restrict law enforcement activity or endanger citizens.

I think another thing to consider is they probably won't be raiding Joe Dirt's trailer park. They'll be raiding major cities, and he'll be watching it go down on TV while white knuckling a Coors and a $400 PSA AR. My real concern is that they could be useful idiots in the form of unregulated militias intimidating or causing violence to people they deem to be the enemy.  What my imagined worst case scenario would be military/heavily militarized police staged at major cities to restrict movement and provide intimidation, while more sparsely populated areas are left to allow unrestricted and undocumented self policing.  You're absolutely right about the military not wanting to enter gun filled cities. However, it's not that much different than conflict in middle eastern cities that has been happening for decades. Sure, the US has more firearms, but unlike insurgents the US civilians do not have access to important firepower like DShKs, PKMs, or anything with anti-armor capabilities.

Right after the election win there were still a lot of disaffected MAGAs, because *angry* and *hateful* and contrarian is all they know how to do. They don't build or govern, they destroy. And letting such have power over the government results in exactly what the US has now, destruction and deportation, essentially nothing of value *built*. While it definitely sucks for the people that never wanted this, I think other more intelligent peoples of the world see what happens when the blowhard xenophobes catch their tail; in just a few short months the US willingly self-destructed its soft power around the world and irrationally damaged their own economy, perhaps indefinitely. Even if the US does course correct I don't blame a single foreign government or citizen treating the US as a schizophrenic pariah. Even when Trump, Elon, etc die or are out of power, that doesn't change the millions that picked these vile leaders.

"Negatory ghost rider - Hell I can remember one knucklehead specialist that was so drunk he couldn't make it 2 miles back the barracks from a party on the installation and out his Subaru in a ditch right off the straight as an arrow road that ran almost directly to the barracks from where he started.  No civilian PD required as it was all on post.   Now where you might be confused is the issue with jurisdictions. Had knucklehead gone outside the gate then we have an issue with civilian law enforcement. Generally speaking the military defers to the local civilian authority in cases that involve both the defendant being on an installation and outside of it.  This serves three main purposes from what I was formally taught: 1) The military has a keen interest in maintaining good relationships with both the local community and maintaining a positive public image overall, so by giving respect to the civilian jurisdiction over crimes committed within it ( regardless of -the same crime - being committed on an installation at the same time ) as SOP, that builds the relationship.  2) The civilian authorities handling things lessens the workload for the military who can allocate said manpower to other cases. 3) If push somehow came to shove, the military would end up losing legally anyway.       Now that doesn't mean at all that separate crimes or the same crime but in separate instances both on and off post cannot be tried both by the military and the civilian courts, but generally the coordination between civilian and military law enforcement is such that if the military has the accused for a more serious offense with an abundance of hard evidence, in that case the civilian authority may want for the military to try the case (and they will) and only try the defendant if somehow the military trial acquits the accused and/or the charges are serious enough to warrant additional prosecution, which, if true the civilian courts would have been first up. Now I personally know of that happening in reverse concerning sexual assault where the Army stepped in to press charges on a separate case after a defendant had been accused of sexually assaulting someone off post but had been found not guilty by a jury. A separate incident against a different victim who was a  Soldier that happened on post was fully prosecuted to a successful conviction following the civilian acquital. I do not know if they would have pursued the charges if the perpetrator had been found guilty.  Shipped off to Leavenworth, and everything on the military side to include the investigation and prosecution etc ..had been handled fully by the Army.   So I realky don't know what your experience has been serving with the Army's kid (Airforce). But I will say, outside of the way Security Forces handle the flight line, the worst security provided for any internal criminal issues I have ever seen was provided by Air Force security forces during one of my deployments to Iraq while at COB Speicher outside of Tikrit.",LibertineLibra,2025-04-29T18:21:55,1

"E Jean Carroll.  The felonies stem from the Stormy Daniel's case and falsifying business records (fraud) that stemmed from that. Michael Cohen and his long-time account went to jail over Donald trumps adulterous affair, but not good old Donald Trump.  The classified documents case.. well, he had his own judge to slow walk the case. It was the obstruction of justice that really gets under my skin there. Hillary was investigated thoroughly, and they found no charges. The documents she had on her server were made classified during and after the case. Biden cooperated and turned over everything they asked for. Trump had his team move classified documents from one room to another and obstructed the investigation at every turn. There were 40 felony counts filed on trump in the documents case alone. Cannon made them disappear. Infuriating!  Insurrectionist claim?

"Well, it's especially notable because Hogg has outright called for mass banning and confiscation and has argued that 2A is not an individual right. His experience, while absolutely formative, should honestly not be part of the gun control debate because school shootings, while tragic, have a very small (in terms of numbers alone) impact on childhood gun deaths. Long guns (rifles, including AR pattern rifles) doubly so as they are a *vast* minority of gun deaths in the US assuming standard chambering. Handguns should be the topic of focus if anything, and school shootings should be part of the discussion around domestic terrorism, radicalization, and how to counter it while securing places like schools - not gun control - but I digress.  The entire topic is further complicated by the fact that any tool that enters the government's ""bag"" will be then given to the other party and can be twisted and distorted. Being generally left-of-center and having lived in Minneapolis during the invasion of skinheads and agitators post-George Floyd's murder - needing to defend myself and others with rifles - I don't want to imagine what could have happened had Trump decided that anyone who lived in a blue state, or blue district, had a ban on ownership.

"This comment isn't the appeal to rationality or logic that you think it is  This person provided evidence of their very serious claims, and you're now choosing to bury your head in the sand and insist that something which can absolutely happen, is instead an impossibility due to how complex it would be.  They conclusively demonstrated that these notions aren't just the byproduct of some harebrained youtube propagandist. This is a real strategy in play at this moment.  And yet you continue to do the smarmy lib thing where you try to shamelessly dismiss a very real problem as nothing.  How many more exceedingly unlikely strings of events that ""absolutely cannot ever happen due to X reasons"" do you need to live through before you finally understand that the world doesn't work the way you think it does?  If it ever got to the point you're describing, the trump regime could just withhold all federal assistance or exert economic pressure on any state that refuses to capitulate to their constitutional demands, and the precedence for doing this has *already been established*.   edit: As proof, Rhode Island had to be forced into ratification under threat of blockade and a trade embargo. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification\_of\_the\_United\_States\_Constitution\_by\_Rhode\_Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification_of_the_United_States_Constitution_by_Rhode_Island)  None of this is nearly as impossible as you're attempting to make it seem.

"My point is that the premise that the frog will just sit there while the water is heated up has had spotty evidence from the beginning.

Recent experiments have *confirmed* that they won‚Äôt just sit and be slowly boiled, and considering frogs are exothermic, and will move from places when they get too hot or too cold, it‚Äôs not surprising.   I mean, as an owner of two pet frogs, I know one essential thing is to maintain a gradient of heating in the enclosure so the frogs can regulate their body temperature by moving when it gets too hot or too cold for them.
