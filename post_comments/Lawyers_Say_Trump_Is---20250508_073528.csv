"***From Rolling Stone’s Andrew Perez:***  President Donald Trump’s administration is working to ramp up its pointless cruelty toward immigrants, and has apparently been plotting to have the military send Asian immigrants to Libya imminently, according to immigration lawyers.  The plan to deport immigrants to Libya, a war-torn country known for widespread mistreatment of migrants, would represent not just a likely human rights violation but another brazen act of defiance toward the federal judiciary.

"I'm pretty sure there are lot's of US citizens abroad right now, and some of those people may be rightfully or wrongfully in the custody of local police/security services. This practice of deportations without due process basically greenlights the very same for any nation to deport and wash their hands of all US citizens in the custody (rightfully or wrongfully) with zero accountability. Is this really the culture that the president and his cronies a keen to cultivate? Discuss.",National_Olive_2846,2025-05-08T09:08:11,7

"I don't know if you guys read your comments, but I'd just like to say keep up the good work. Rolling Stone seems to be breaking most of the big stories first and one of the few outlets to be covering, in detail, what is going on inside the trump regime. I appreciate what you guys have been doing.",Rdick_Lvagina,2025-05-08T07:48:39,21
