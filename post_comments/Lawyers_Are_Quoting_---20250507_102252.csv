"*From Bloomberg News reporters Ava Benny-Morrison¬†and¬†Bill Allison:*  Powerful people in business and finance are rushing pitches and stepping up lobbying, catering their appeals to Trump and hiring lawyers with connections to the administration. These defendants with means are spending big for a chance to clear their names, at least in official records if not in public perception. Interviews with about two dozen lawyers and pardon hopefuls, many of whom asked not to be identified discussing plans that weren‚Äôt public, have pulled back the curtain on the clemency process under Trump. Some outlined plans to spend at least tens of thousands of dollars on attorneys, lobbyists and consultants, while others say the costs will reach well north of $1 million to put cases together and get them in front of the White House.
