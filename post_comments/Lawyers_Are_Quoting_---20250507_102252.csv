"*From Bloomberg News reporters Ava Benny-Morrison and Bill Allison:*  Powerful people in business and finance are rushing pitches and stepping up lobbying, catering their appeals to Trump and hiring lawyers with connections to the administration. These defendants with means are spending big for a chance to clear their names, at least in official records if not in public perception. Interviews with about two dozen lawyers and pardon hopefuls, many of whom asked not to be identified discussing plans that weren’t public, have pulled back the curtain on the clemency process under Trump. Some outlined plans to spend at least tens of thousands of dollars on attorneys, lobbyists and consultants, while others say the costs will reach well north of $1 million to put cases together and get them in front of the White House.

That’s how the Catholic Church started to come apart in the time of Luther. The Pope was selling “indulgences” ( free pass into heaven) to rich benefactors.

Alexander the Great was a brilliant military mind but politically he had a won’t for executing his subordinates. He was absolutely not benevolent. A benevolent dictator is one who wields their absolute authority for the good of their people and nation. It’s very rare for these types of people to come into power.
