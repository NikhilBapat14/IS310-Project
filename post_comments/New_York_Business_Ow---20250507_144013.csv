"“The city is trying to have it both ways. If someone falls and injures themselves on the sidewalk, it's 100% Della Vecchia's problem and they will reject responsibility. However, if he puts a fence around ""his property,"" the city demands he take it down as if they have rights to use his property without compensation.  As Della Vecchia sees it, the city could buy the property that includes the road and the sidewalk from him for about one million dollars (based on the per SF value of property in Queens). If they won't do that, he plans to leave the fence in place because whatever fine the city can dish out can't compare to the cost of another slip and fall lawsuit for which he is solely responsible.”  I like this guy’s stance. Granted, this is a NYC-area city, so wouldn’t be surprised if some back door crony deals are made against him and the judge/court rules in the city’s favor anyway. Or they come up with some obscure stupid law clearly targeted at him to make him financially miserable until he takes it down. This is a deep-blue metro area we’re talking about.",ITrCool,2025-05-07T15:58:48,8
Now this is a case I want to follow. Good for this guy for standing up against the bullshit.,JustinCayce,2025-05-07T15:54:57,7
If he owns the land and there is no easement clause or such in the ownership then he has every right to do this.  Either the city is responsible in the first place or the fence stays up.  That is how it seems to me.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T16:20:45,4
