">Last week, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, sent a letter to the CHEST Journal, a scientific journal for chest doctors, implying it was partisan and asking a series of questions about the steps it took to include ***competing viewpoints*** and protect the public from misinformation.  ""Competing viewpoints"". Ah yes, the MAGA-speak for (ultra)conservative ideology propaganda.",HumanWithComputer,2025-04-26T09:25:25,17
It is BS trying to force them to comply and a direct attack on the acedemic freedom. The US is speedrunning their way to a dictatorship.,Erikblod,2025-04-26T09:17:23,7
"The idea is to keep scientific knowledge that may contradict medical policies of the administration silence. Administration wants dominance and censorship because the guy at the helm as the head of DHHS \[Department of Health and Human Services\] holds medical beliefs that is questioned every passing day.   >Credible journals ensure studies undergo peer review, in which research receives scrutiny from outside experts to check for errors or poor research practices. ",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-26T09:18:28,7

"Competing viewpoints need to be based on research and scientific evidence.  It can't just be made up on a whim to support your political stance. MAGA is taking anti-vaccine propaganda from Andrew Wakefield, who once linked autism to MMR vaccines. He is a fraudster medical professional who lost his medical license.   https://healthland.time.com/2010/05/24/doctor-behind-vaccine-autism-link-loses-license/",Financial-Special766,2025-04-26T09:37:12,2
"At least three scientific journals, including New England Journal of Medicine and Chest have been sent letters from the U.S. Department of Justice, under Attorney General Jam Bondi.  The position seems to be supported by health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  He has said he wants to prosecute (PROSECUTE!?) medical journals, accusing them of lying to the public and colluding with pharmaceutical companies. They demanded that the journal’s publishers answer a series of questions by May 2.  The nerve of non-scientist anti-vax believer, autism misleader, to threaten prestigious scientific journals for not including his unsupported beliefs in their publications.  Trump administration again disrespecting the first amendment.  Government is not allowed to force citizens to express government-favored opinions.  Get A Clue Trump Administration!  This is typical Trump administration behavior, attacking opinions of select “enemies” to generate fear in the field.  Same way as he controls chicken republicans in Congress.  RFKJ - “I’m going to litigate against you under the racketeering laws, under the general tort laws,” the he said. “I’m going to find a way to sue you unless you come up with a plan right now to show how you’re going to start publishing real science and stop retracting the real science and publishing the fake pharmaceutical science by these phony industry mercenaries.”  Keep Politics Out of Science.  In many cases, there are Not two credible conclusions to be drawn from compiled scientific evidence.  The world is more than 4400 years old and vaccines do not cause autism.  There is a difference between causation and: coincidence, anecdotes, or correlation.  Shaving your face correlates with a shorter life span but it is not what causes men to die at an earlier age than women.",Last_Lonely_Traveler,2025-04-28T00:37:16,1
"I'd like to see these motherfuckers try and explain the scientific process and the peer review process to the doctors and scientists they're trying to intimidate. The letters section of a journal is an area for ""competing viewpoints"".",jellicledonkeyz,2025-04-26T11:11:53,7
