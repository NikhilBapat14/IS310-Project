“That's a major red flag for a president whose chaotic style is only tolerated when it delivers results.”  Has he ever delivered any results?  The only thing I can think of is Paul Ryan’s tax cut and some criminal reform in Trump 1.  Honest question did he get anything else done?,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-24T06:01:27,34

"Too late MAGA, you voted for him and you will now pay the price along with the rest of us",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T06:20:10,8
And this is why any attempts to negotiate with MAGA will always fail.  Their worldview is based on white supremecy and hurting those they view as less than.    A Nazi who is good at economic policy is still a Nazi.,throwaway758616516,2025-04-24T06:51:49,7

Trump warned voters that he'd do exactly what he is doing before they voted for him.  What are they going to do? Vote *Democrat*? They'd sooner vote for Hitle(R) himself before voting for a stinking Communist Corporate Do-Nothing Democrat.,SinisterYear,2025-04-24T07:34:18,3
Us very woke progressive liberal socialist never-Trumpers; or at least that's the things their very highly funded and blanketed media products call us; tried to warn America of the agenda some very awful people were financing. They did not listen.,postsshortcomments,2025-04-24T08:23:11,2
Oh? Trump voters are surprised that he conned them to do a job with the pay being promised at a later date?,Colonel_Zander,2025-04-24T08:38:19,2
"This is what white men in America want. After over a decade of targeted grooming and propaganda, they’ve been subconsciously conditioned to hate the out group (minorities, immigrants, etc). Historically, this rarely ends well when the conservatives begin using identity politics as their reactionary means. Human nature at its core is tribal, racist and prejudice. Our job as citizens is to fight these instincts in order to live together peacefully",Parking_Syrup_9139,2025-04-24T09:05:10,2

"If you consume only right wing media, you believe he walked on water. So it takes being personal affected to start changing your perspective. And from what I've seen, the change is slow and limited.  So basically, they believe what they were told.",ss_lbguy,2025-04-24T06:35:35,19
