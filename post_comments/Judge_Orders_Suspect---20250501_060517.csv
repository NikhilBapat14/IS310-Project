"How does a judge in Massachusetts have anything to do with a criminal in Missouri? Did he have to post bail? Does the prosecutor in this case have no authority at all? Hell, this federal judge may as well adjudicate this case personally, she's already usurped discretion. This MUST stop.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T07:02:32,201

"U.S. Magistrate Judge Jessica Hedges agreed that Owen McIntire, 19, a student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, should be released after McIntire’s lawyers “argued” he be released, noting that “he has no criminal record” and that he has “strong ties to his community in Missouri,” according to KMBC News.   Church lady “ well isn’t that special”! How thoughtful of this judge, how considerate of her concern for an alleged criminal.  Maybe she should pursue Kilmar too?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-01T07:39:09,28

">""He also receives gender-affirming medical care, which began in March of this year and is likely to be interrupted or terminated entirely if he remains in pretrial detention,"" a court filing from the judge reads. ""This care, along with mental health support, is integral to his wellbeing. By moving back home with his parents, he will have access to the care providers who are familiar with him and his specific needs.""

Yet another day where democrats manage to piss me off. I wonder if a day will ever come where I can go a full 24 hours without them pissing me off.  Disbar the judge and throw the terrorist supporter and terrorist in GITMO.,Nero_Ocean,2025-05-01T10:36:24,8

"To be fair, bond is just to make sure they show up for trial. Remember that they are still presumed innocent.   The trial will still happen and if convicted then that's when we will see the sentence. Which in my opinion should be fairly stiff    Seems like a very solid case so we are just talking about the timing here.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-01T10:04:46,5

"The whole thing is ridiculous but I would assume that the individual was arrested in Massachusetts on a federal warrant out of Missouri, and had his initial appearance and detention hearing in Massachusetts. During the detention hearing, the judge determined that the defendant didn't need to be kept in custody.   It's generally bad form for a suspect arrested on a warrant from another district to not be ordered detained until that District can make its own decision. Particularly in a case that involves violence and danger to the community.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-01T08:25:01,31

"The article was rather vague on details. Generally speaking, someone is tried in the court that has jurisdiction over the area in which the crime was committed. This guy should have been extradited to Missouri to stand trial and the judge presiding over the case sets bail and release conditions. Even if he was arrested in Massachusetts no judge there should have jurisdicion over anything pretrial other than the extradition itself. But the federal judiciary has stuck it's nose into every facet of this administration so I cannot say that I'm surprised.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T09:12:19,16
"It shouldn't be the MA judges' responsibility to set release conditions. If officials in MO want him extradited THEN possibly set an extradition hearing and go from there. Otherwise, he should be sent to MO for the presiding judge to set conditions for release, if any, before trial.  I got nothing from the article about an extradition hearing. I don't see where the opinion of the judge in Massachusetts carries any weight. To top it off, he was sent back to MO with instructions from a *Massachusetts* judge.

"The court must have two types of jurisdiction. First, personal jurisdiction, which grants the court authority over the individuals appearing before it. Second, subject matter jurisdiction, which pertains to the court's authority to adjudicate the specific legal issues involved.  Currently, the Missouri court lacks personal jurisdiction in this case, meaning it does not have the authority to regulate or control the individual's movements. Additionally, it appears that the U.S. Attorney does not deem extradition to Missouri necessary. It's why they argue the individual has sufficient ties to the community, indicating he is not a flight risk.  My gut says there are a number of other conditions in place that weren't covered in the article. Like he must return to Missouri in a certain period, appear before the relavent court, notify of his location e etc.",sixtysecdragon,2025-05-01T10:47:53,4
"Yeah, none of it makes sense to me. All I know is that if I commit a crime where I am now then flee, wherever I go will ship my ass right back to stand trial. Guess that when you commit a crime that the left agrees with and then run to a liberal jurisdiction you get special treatment.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T11:02:30,4
