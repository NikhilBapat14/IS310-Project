Why not make a separate bill that just raises taxes on the rich?  They won't do that because then the public would know that it's just political theater and the republicans will never actually vote to pass it.,BlotchComics,2025-05-08T15:46:03,22

"Clinton, Obama and Biden all raised taxes on the wealthy, expanded government programs for average Americans,  shrank the deficit and rebuilt a strong economy.   Trump and Bush cut taxes on the wealthy,  cut government programs,  increased the deficit and crashed the economy.  If you want fiscal responsibility and higher taxes on the wealthy,  vote for Democrats.",aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-08T17:51:26,6

"Sounds like furthest it'll go would be the post-2017 37% top rate reverting to pre-2017 39.6% and closing carried interest loophole on capital gains. I'd be surprised if either happen, the first one maybe.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-05-08T15:51:35,3

"What happened, boo? You went from telling Congress what to do, doing it anyway, then doing it illegally and ignoring courts to now bartering with Mike Johnson?  If Donald Trump wants to lower your taxes, he would. This is just a headline. It’s just pretend. He ignores the law all day long when it comes to money and congress. He doesn’t want to lower your taxes.",brakeled,2025-05-09T08:54:53,1

"The catch is that the ultra wealthy they care about above all else are people who derive practically all of their income (or increase in wealth) from their return on capital.  The rich people they would be taxing are the people who derive substantial amounts of their income (or increase in wealth) from their labor  Think the surgeon, lawyer, or high level corporate manager, top senior software engineers   The owners of capital will still be getting their ROI",NOLA-Bronco,2025-05-08T17:09:56,3
