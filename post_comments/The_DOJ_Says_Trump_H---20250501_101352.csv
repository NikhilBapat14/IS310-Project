"On a different note: In a more rational society that actually cared about human lives, the social contagion that causes cops to flip out when encountering fentanyl would be really interesting to study.   It is a microcosm of their whole training, so it is representative of how that training might be shaping their perceptions of reality. If we can convince such a large number of police that being in the same room with fentanyl is enough to kill them, a frankly ridiculous assertion, how easy must it be it to convince them that anyone who matches certain profiles are also a threat to their life?   It really explains so much. They are indoctrinated into a system that teaches them to *be constantly afraid at all times.* Then uses that fear to convince them to both abuse their power individually, and also uphold the corporate power of the system itself. They can't compromise, because compromise will, in their minds, put their lives at even more risk. They have to support these discriminatory policies and corrupt systems because *they will LITERALLY DIE* if they do not.   All of their justifications for their behavior end up being based on this constant fear. In their minds they are the ""thin blue line"" between order/life and chaos/death, and so anything they do is just the cost of doing business. There is no evil they can commit that is unjustifiable.   So it seems hilarious that they will have full on seizures from literally nothing, but that same fear and altered perception is not just limited seeing a drug, it is a part of everything they do, because they are indoctrinated into it.",Caelinus,2025-05-01T13:25:20,6

"To be clear, I'm not at all saying fentanyl isn't a real problem. This administration suggests it cares about the impact of fentanyl and uses it to justify policy, mostly relating to border security and immigration, under the auspices of preventing people from dying from it.

"So, your comment doesn't say it directly, but I think the underlying threat you are describing here is from accidentally touching some form of the drug. [That's not actually dangerous.](https://www.acmt.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/PRS_170701_Preventing-Occupational-Fentanyl-and-Fentanyl-Analog-Exposure-to-Emergency-Responders.pdf) It's a myth that touching fentanyl can cause overdose. Despite any propaganda you've heard from LEOs about the risk, the actual expert guidance is that it's not a problem, and the likelihood of dangerous levels of absorption through accidental dermal contact are so low as to be negligible.  Which makes sense, as otherwise drug addicts and drug dealers would be dying a *hell* of a lot more often. They touch the drug all the time.",Z010011010,2025-05-01T17:38:50,6
