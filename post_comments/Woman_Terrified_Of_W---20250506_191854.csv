"“and her low IQ.” This is my favorite part of the article.  Her IQ could be negative and she would still get reelected. Her seat is safe, so she can afford to make those kind of statements.",rdenghel,2025-05-06T20:17:12,150

Should I try and write for Babylon Bee? Some of their stuff is funny. Some of it seems very uninformed on a street level. As in the joke could have been even funnier if it wasn't written by mean spirited Christian conservatives who doesn't know much else beyond Christian Conservativism in general.,Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-05-06T22:02:45,-46

"[Maybe you could write for the Minnesota House of Representatives:](https://www.house.mn.gov/Caucus/View/NR/40029)  >St. Paul - Rep. Steve Drazkowski (Republican-Mazeppa) today called on U.S. Rep. Angie Craig (Democrat-Minnesota) to open an ethics investigation into the activities of Rep. Ilhan Omar (Democrat-Minnesota). Furthermore, Rep. Drazkowski has called for the withdrawal of Rep. Omar’s security clearance and for her removal from the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.  >“Rep. Omar has been found guilty of campaign finance abuses by the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board (CFB), which is expected to take further action against her on Wednesday,” Rep. Drazkowski said. “In addition to previous campaign finance abuses, Rep. Omar was found on June 6, 2019 to have illegally used campaign funds for personal use and illegally diverting campaign funds for travel to Washington, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Florida. Rep. Omar may be guilty of federal tax fraud, federal immigration fraud, federal student loan fraud, perjury, and bigamy. Enough is enough.     >“The media is applying a double standard to Rep. Omar,” Rep. Drazkowski continued. “If a Republican Congresswoman had been accused of all these crimes, reporters would be in an uproar.”",goat-head-man,2025-05-07T06:21:25,17
