"He has no moral center. He just wants people to like him, even if it’s by other monsters who want to deport 3 year old children with cancer. He probably really believes these polls are fake because he’s surrounded by sycophants who compliment his new clothes and the smell of his farts.",NapOwl,2025-04-29T09:39:36,36

"So you know how MAGA in general is completely delusional when it comes to reality? Well, I wonder if trump himself is actually even deeper in because of his handlers.   Going back to the Abrego Garcia SCOTUS 9-0 ruling where trump said he won that big time, then in a later interview they asked him about the ruling and he said he was told it was 9-0 in his favor.  Maybe.... just maybe.... he's actually telling the truth here. As in he is being completely gaslit by his handlers and he actually believes he's popular? He actually believes all the BS he says because they keep just telling him that?   I dunno, maybe I'm just trying to make sense of everything.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-29T09:40:00,10

"Well the good news is that at least we know what he cares about.  I’d suggest blasting these numbers to his social media feeds, on every news station that will show them, bring it up at every press conference.  Maybe his ego and desire to have high ratings will make him do things that don’t piss everyone off.  Maybe he’ll do the right thing for the wrong reasons.  Just kidding he’ll say they are fake news, threaten the pollsters and make up his own approval ratings.",funguy07,2025-04-29T14:58:38,1

"Oh I'm not saying he's a victim here, just more of that he's in a positive feedback loop with complete disconnect from the real world. As in he's still a racist, but his circle keeps telling him that people LIKE it. That kind of situation. So he thinks these polls are fake because everyone is telling him that his horrible views are actually popular.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-29T13:35:19,2
"Fair enough. Still, if the POTUS hired his people based on their ability to kiss ass rather than give him accurate feedback to make decisions that is entirely his fault.
