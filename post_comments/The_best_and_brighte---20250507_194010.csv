"Brain drain in full effect thanks to Trump and **ELON MUSK** (don’t forget he is a huge player in specifically driving science and research away just because he’s quieter now!)  Can’t wait for the US to regress to the status of North Korea and Russia while Europe and Canada recruit some of the greatest minds in the world. But at least we showed the woke mob we won’t stand for pronouns in emails, right guys?",snarky_marmot,2025-05-07T19:45:09,19
"The slashing of university research and NOAA research facilities is going to come back to bite us later.   Our priorities, spending, tax collection, and economic laws all favor one group because they paid for it to be that way,",Powellwx,2025-05-07T20:15:34,7

"This is just the beginning, sadly, and another ""Trump Did THAT""!🙄  Snippet:  * “Why would you stay in a country where there’s not really an obvious commitment to science, when you could go somewhere else and be better funded and not worry about what you can read in the news or what email you’re going to get?” * Meanwhile, the pressure on scientists to leave the U.S. is only increasing. On Monday, the European Union [launched a drive to attract scientists to Europe](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/innovation/europe-drives-attract-scientists-trump-freezes-us-funding-rcna204803), and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a commitment of $566 million to attract U.S. talent and “make Europe a magnet for researchers.” ",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T19:42:40,2

">Brain drain  Yeah, an example is going with a ""wellness influencer"" as the new surgeon general!🤦  OH, then there's RFK, Jr. who is an ally of the new wellness influencer surgeon general!  Talk about brain drain!",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T19:57:11,11

"Yes, it is already very unstable. It blows my mind how quickly things have changed.  Sadly, I do believe that more will leave, like your son who wants to do/create something meaningful and not have to deal with all the b/s!",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T20:31:26,3
"Yeah, I've seen articles about Canada being a good place for U.S. graduates, and it's a win/win for the students and, of course, for Canada. But, a big loss for us, sadly.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T20:41:16,2

"I feel bad for what average American is going through. Trump started a tariff war without a domestic plan to launch along side. If this continues, parts of USA could resemble 80’s USSR with line ups/product availability, though I hope not. If you’re super wealthy in USA though, things aren’t so bad at all",togocann49,2025-05-07T20:51:16,2
