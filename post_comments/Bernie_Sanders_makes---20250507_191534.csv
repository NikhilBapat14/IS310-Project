Bernie is such a hypocrite.,Resident_Maybe_6869,2025-05-08T05:33:21,10
"Whatâ€™s he gonna do, apologize? That would be weirder.",UltraAirWolf,2025-05-07T22:56:40,40
John Kerry didn't apologize either for flying in wifey's private jet for climate BS in Davos.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-07T19:34:06,49
"He's an oligarch-lite who got his wealth from being paid to preach what he doesn't practice.  ***How Exactly Many*** of these do we need? I feel like I could spend all day listing people who get rich quick like this without calling it anywhere near a complete list.  I'm partly pro-DOGE to save taxpayers some money, but I'm mostly pro-DOGE to cut off the seemingly infinite supply of chalkboard rake noises. *""How Dare Youâ„¢""*",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T19:20:56,59
"Good.  I make no apologies for owning a single family home in suburbia, two IC automobiles, a gas cooktop in my kitchen, AC, eating beef...  and voting for Donald J. Trump!",newgalactic,2025-05-07T20:13:36,49
Flight Oligarchy more like.Â  Spent over 221k on private jets alone.Â  Such a hypocritical piece of shit.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-07T19:33:24,40
The Oligarchs told Bernie to say that.,Whole-Essay640,2025-05-08T06:52:21,2
If thereâ€™s one truth in life those who preach socialism are bound to be hypocrites of the highest order.,SouthernNumismatist,2025-05-07T20:20:12,9
Hypocrites. Were we not just ruled by the ghoulish controligarchs from the WEF for four years under climate control hysteria? Iâ€™m almost confident that the release of COVID was intentional and done by these people.,Any-Passion8322,2025-05-07T20:29:07,1
They need all the luxuries of capitalism to champion the beauty of socialism. Reminds me of Brezhnev and his fleet of German made Mercedez.,AldrichOfAlbion,2025-05-08T07:04:27,1
"lol! Oh please!  You don't ""appologize"" to the serfs, omfg!!  #ðŸ¤£",H3nchman_24,2025-05-08T00:16:36,0
"He could acknowledge the contradiction. If someone were out there advocating for PETA but eating burgers every night, then turned around and said, ""I can't help the cause if I starve,"" they'd come off as pretty hypocritical, too.",BryanFnR,2025-05-08T07:17:13,11
"But you don't go around trying to ban then for other people.  Bernie tried a little ""What about Trump using a private jet,"" and Brett turned it around by saying, well he's not fighting the oligarchy, you are.    Leftists are some of the biggest gatekeepers, especially around housing, so I'm glad you brought it up.  Some of the worst subs have this thing against single family homes, because they're ""hoarding land"" and low-density housing contributes to rising costs, and that's why no one can buy a house blah blah.  But their solution is always to loosen zoning and build multi-family and high density housing units.  So *other* people can live there, and free up the nice SFH for themselves.",JerseyKeebs,2025-05-08T07:21:19,9

He doesnâ€™t want to come off as a hypocrite so heâ€™s not going to acknowledge the contradiction,UltraAirWolf,2025-05-08T07:25:15,3
