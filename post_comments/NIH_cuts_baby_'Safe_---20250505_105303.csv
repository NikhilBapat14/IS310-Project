"It will be interesting to see what the mortality rates are 5 years from now. There are so many cuts to programs that are (ostensibly, at least) intended to prevent harm, and there needs to be an accounting for actual lives lost for the sake of ""eliminating waste"" in the national budget.",American_Farewell,2025-05-05T11:02:36,45

"SIDS (not suffocation) has already been going up for several years, and it was already going down before the Safe Sleep campaign was introduced. The only ""reduction"" after that was the removal of vaccines as a classifiable factor in the deaths.

But.. without new flyers being distributed with updated graphics each year and sent to every single service that interacts with new parents how will parents know to lay their infants on their backs in a crib or bassinet with a tight fitted sheet?! ,OppositeChemistry205,2025-05-05T14:52:50,-16
"Agreed. Unfortunately in their eyes, babies who die from issues like SIDS didn’t deserve to live anyway. They love attacking the vulnerable of society in the name of God’s will.",AlllliillllA,2025-05-05T11:33:25,16

Data will be limited because the funding for collecting and analyzing it is being cut too. Remember when Trump wanted to keep Covid rates low by not testing people? That’s the approach to everything now.,Special-Sherbert1910,2025-05-05T15:13:37,7
"Listen, I think the parents and the babies will be okay without the flyers. I guarantee everyone will somehow get the message about laying babies on their back in a bassinet in the same room as you with only a fitted sheet.

"God's will is a smokescreen. Jesus's teachings were essentially progressive. Even the old testament's basic moral thesis comes down to Kane's question of ""am I my brother's keeper?"" Essentially everything else in the books is an elaboration on the implied answer of: yes, yes you are. Yes, you are responsible for taking care of your fellow man.   Since at least Reagan, the conservatives have actively pursued a sacrilege campaign of trying to remove that core thesis from the American Christian culture and replace it with, essentially, LaVeyan Satanism's ""do what though wilt shall be the whole of the law."" (No where in the Bible does it talk about service to God making one rich and powerful, but that sure does sound like some deal with the devil shit, don't it?)

“I guarantee everyone will somehow get the message”  Is a shocking take regarding babies dying,Louise1467,2025-05-05T15:02:08,20
"I wish you were right but I’ve worked in public health so I know the sad truth. Public health initiatives like anti-smoking, safe sex, seatbelt etc take DOZENS of touch points to see impacts. People are more likely to do what other people around them do vs what an authority figure tells them to do.   In this case social media is already full of crazy moms ranting that cosleeping is natural and safe sleep is cruel. So yea, I really hope the data proves me wrong but I’m not optimistic.",beaconbay,2025-05-05T15:00:31,15

"If they cut this program and this program only then probably states and private foundations and whoever else could step in, but when they are cutting everything at once there is no more slack in the system to pick anything up and so much chaos that a lot of stuff is falling through the cracks.   And getting babies to sleep is big business so there are new, unsafe products and practices being created regularly.",Adept_Carpet,2025-05-05T14:57:25,7
You really think it’s just about flyers? This makes a statement and sets a precedent. Also why don’t you read the article because I feel like if you have this stance you probably didn’t take the time to read that infant deaths are on the rise.,DefiantBumblebee9903,2025-05-05T14:54:48,6

You understand that babies are not suddenly going to start dying at increased rates because the mother was only told verbally at every appointment about safe sleep rather than being told verbally and being given a pamphlet at every appointment. The guidance has not changed. Parents will still be given the same guidance. Genetic defects and preterm birth will continue to be the leading cause of infant death.,OppositeChemistry205,2025-05-05T15:11:44,-8
"I'm sure they received the message, they just chose not to listen. Those who claim they haven't heard of safe sleep definitely are not reading the handouts and pamphlets to begin with.  The whole reason the campaign was necessary was because pediatricians use to tell parents stomach to sleep. It's been 30 years since they updated the guidance. The word is out.",OppositeChemistry205,2025-05-05T15:44:57,-4
"I did read the article. It says -  Safe to Sleep created the public health messaging for this information and distributed it on social media, as well as in pamphlets targeted to specific groups, such as grandparents, and translated it into different languages. It also provided the materials to hospitals and doctor's offices to be handed out to patients. All of this material was produced and distributed by the office of communications at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.   The program was successive, everyone knows about safe sleep. Now it's just pamphlets and marketing that no one needs.   The current leading causes of infant death are genetic defects, preterm birth and low birth weight, SIDS, unintentional accidents like car accidents, and maternal pregnancy complications in that order. Leaving the hospital with 6 flyers on safe sleep after every appointment isn't going to cause a course correction on those issues.",OppositeChemistry205,2025-05-05T15:02:06,1
"An alive baby is better. Head deformities are often not permanent. They adjust as they get older.   Also, it's often because parents put them in container way too often.  Those swings, car seats, etc.",Strategic_Spark,2025-05-06T07:52:42,3
"There’s truly no worse take on this than yours which is “It’ll be fine!”   And even if I responded to you with actual data regarding how public health messaging campaigns that are backed by funding from the federal government have literally prevented MILLIONS of deaths you wouldn’t care because you have made up your mind to blindly support everything and anything this administration does.   So, it seems fruitless for the two of us to go back and forth on this and I’m sure you’d agree.",Louise1467,2025-05-05T15:27:49,11

">It’s been thirty years… The word is out.   My parents had me (their youngest) in their mid thirties. By the time we had our kids, all of their knowledge around things like sleep, feeding, and generally safety were wildly outdated because they were still operating with the same information they had in 1988.  And these are the people - like your parents - who you’re most likely to take advice from on parenting.",Chris_HitTheOver,2025-05-05T17:39:50,6
"You know what? You have a point. We should just completely cease all messaging about how to have a healthy pregnancy, how to prevent preterm births,  how to safely install car seats, etc.   Let’s roll the dice and just plan that across generations , everyone will just “get the message somehow “",Louise1467,2025-05-05T15:15:34,5

"Some deaths *have* to be ""okay"", even if sad, given that we live in a finite world with finite resources.  If saving one non-specific life cost the government $5 trillion, would we spend the money? Of course not.  If it cost $5? Yes, absolutely. (I hope.)  That means there IS a dividing line. There's an amount that's worth it, and an amount that's not worth it, and believe it or not, but people have different opinions about where the government should draw the line. And that amount likely changes depending on the age of the person. (Sorry, but we're probably more willing to spend extra money for a young adult to live than for someone who's 85.)",shroomsAndWrstershir,2025-05-05T20:59:24,1
Well every pediatrician follows AAP and CDC guidelines and so the guidelines still say to tell every parent about safe to sleep so I believe the message will still be heard loud and clear. The only change will be one less pamphlet in the recycling or perhaps one less targeted ad online.,OppositeChemistry205,2025-05-05T15:31:30,0
