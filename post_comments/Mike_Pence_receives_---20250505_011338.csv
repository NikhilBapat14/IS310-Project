The “I did my job” award.,anxcaptain,2025-05-05T05:53:20,124
"Did it ultimately matter? He gave us a 4-year delay on fascism, but didn't prevent it. A real hero would have made it his mission to prevent Trump from getting into office again, Pence had every opportunity to speak up and didn't.",RealGianath,2025-05-05T01:26:18,188

"“But I also have differences with members of my own party, on spending and tariffs, and my belief that America is the leader of the free world and must continue to stand with Ukraine until the Russian invasion is repelled and a just and lasting peace is secured,” Pence said.  The fact he said this during his speech... I give him big props and 100% agree.",Apprehensive-Mind705,2025-05-05T06:49:48,9
Pence is like a lowlife career criminal who one day rescues a family from a house fire. He's a generally shitty person who did something courageous and important that day and then went back to being a shitty person again.,RunDNA,2025-05-05T01:44:37,35

"If they give this out using the same criteria that JFK used to write the book, this makes sense. It's not about whether the person is or was a good person. It's about whether they put the nation over their party or their own political careers in the times that it mattered the most.   I've never liked the orange man that can't read, and I knew pence was just a warm body and lame duck. But Jan 6th, among the hours of insanity, he did surprise me. Was it perfect? No. Did he stop trump? No. But he did throw (pretty much) all of it away when it mattered the most.   I'd never vote for him, but this does make sense.  If we don't, at a minimum, commend defection, then we've taken one more reason away from someone TO defect. And if the award doesn't mean anything anyways, then I don't see the harm. Irl, I'm not dragging someone through the mud after they've had their realization. All up until, of course.",Proud-Outside-887,2025-05-05T03:08:28,8
"It took courage.  It's beyond the old bible thumper's control that the Biden administration failed to bury Trump in four years. There are many, many timelines where this would have happened. They were far too bloody nice. They could have used all the weapons of government, law, and techniques for the influence of public opinion to get the job done, and they did not. ",Soggy_Employer9171,2025-05-05T04:16:45,6

He tried to follow the order but could not work out a way so begrudgingly allowed the election to go forth. He was on board just weak. This award means as much as the Nobel Peace Prize once they gave it to mercifully dead evil ghoul Henry Kissinger (who would have happily helped Pence flip the election),DatabaseFickle9306,2025-05-05T05:21:03,2

"While he arguably saved the US from a second Trump term, I can't help but wonder if it would have been as unhinged as this shit clearly is.  Trump has used the intervening four years to become more decrepit mentally, ferment all his little hatreds, scrawl names on a shitlist, and be manipulated by the likes of Thiel and other broligarchs.  If he'd have had eight years in a row, his second four might not have been so planned out.  We might not have as many crazy ass tariff shits and DOGE.  Instead, we get a gap four in which he brainrotted - and they prepared - and as a result, tariffs, P2025 and JD Vance are a thing.  So, thanks Pence, I guess.  Also, thanks Biden.  But I suppose Ukraine got a fighting chance, so there is that.",Deguilded,2025-05-05T07:19:50,1

Mike Pence sucks in most ways that human being can. But when the chips were down and it was time to act, he rose to the occasion and did the right thing.   Heroism isn’t based on a retrospective of someone’s entire life and being. It’s merely based on whether or not you answer its call when it’s presented to you. And Mike Pence did just that. Yes he sucks. Yes he enabled many of the things that led to that point, but he answered that call when it came to him. He didn’t run away, he didn’t join the attack, he fought back and succeeded. That’s why he deserves this. He deserves praise for the good thing that he did. It doesn’t wash away the bad shit he did. But he deserves credit for this.",HighScorsese,2025-05-05T10:16:53,1

Also, he helped kill a bunch of people/infect a bunch of people with HIV in southern Indiana by axing needle exchange programs and had a zero response to the ongoing drug problems across the state. He has views of religion that don’t work with being a public official. He is very weird.   I do think it’s worth it in this case, though, since it’ll piss off the White House.
