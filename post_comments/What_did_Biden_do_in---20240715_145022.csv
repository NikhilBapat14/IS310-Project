It's more of what he DIDN'T do. He did not comment on any of Trumps impending trials untill they were over. That is something Trump did concerning trials of his allies. He DIDN'T call on his political enemies to be imprisoned. That is something Trump did. He didn't advocate for crowds to rough up protesters at his rallies. That's something Trump did.   And just as a reminder as the facts come out it seams the shooter was a conservative not a liberal.,rationalcrank,2024-07-15T17:15:04,45

"Look at how Trump behaves, and compare it to Biden.  Here's Trump's July 4th message this year:  > Happy Fourth of July to all, including to our highly incapable “President,” who uses Prosecutors to go after his Political Opponent, who choked like a dog during the Debate but tried to pretend it was “International Travel” (only 12 days rest!) and, when that gig was up, he blamed it on a “cold.” Therefore, why would anyone say he’s cognitively challenged? Also, respects to our potentially new Democrat Challenger, Laffin’ Kamala Harris. She did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting to Iowa, but that doesn’t mean she’s not a “highly talented” politician! Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco. Someone else that I have to compliment is a Deranged Biden Prosecutor named Jack Smith, who has become a Legend in his own mind for all of those cases he has lost. The Corrupt Prosecutors are working hard for Crooked Joe, but it will never be enough — MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Here's Biden's:  > As we celebrate the Fourth of July, I’m grateful for the countless service members who are the backbone of who we are as a nation. Their service reminds us that democracy is never guaranteed—every generation must fight to maintain it.  I mean, it's not even close. It's a joke that we're even talking about this.",[deleted],2024-07-15T17:58:23,28

"part of the problem is we are still here 4 years after January 6th with no actual judicial reckoning for the leadership of that riot.  I understand our system is slow and a need to be thorough but the methodical tromp thru the peons that rioted has left the organizers to plot and realize that they were either going to eventually be jailed - or they needed to do every single thing in their power to regain the office to stay free, weaving conspiracy theories and distrust everywhere they could.    Biden and the DOJ needed to nip this years ago at this point, so the country could move on with the facts laid bare and justice being delivered.

"I’ll note that at the beginning of his administration he even *tried* to find common ground with the non-psycho GOP politicians. They rebuffed him, no matter how logical or helpful to them he was. Especially during the Covid crisis. I think he really deluded himself into believing he was uniquely capable of bringing the country together. I say that because he experienced firsthand the GOP tactics of divisiveness and refusal to compromise during eight years as VP to Obama. Trump didn’t spontaneously happen; he was just the embodiment of the party as it stood and it was beyond obvious.",Mia-Wal-22-89,2024-07-15T23:10:54,3

"Re ""the next coming of Hitler"", this isn't like, some cynical smear campaign by the Democrats. Trump's *own VP* compared him to Hitler.
