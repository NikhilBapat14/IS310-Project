Grilled meat is way healthier than most of the over processed carb and cheap oil crap that fills the grocery store.   Plus it fills you up and is delicious.,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-06T10:44:08,128

Vanity Fair is part of the Condé Nast Publications which are all leftist rags. Condé Nast is owned by Advance Publications. Reddit is subsidiary of Advance.   Does it makes sense to you now?,Tikiku,2025-05-06T11:10:41,30

"Because a balanced, natural diet rich in protein, fats, vegetables, legumes, greens, eggs and other products “closer to the dirt” is better than the garbage that passes for “food” in this country.   They only want to attack beef because it doesn’t fit the ESG goals they’ve been brainwashed (and paid) to promote.  Also steak is freekin’ delicious.  You know what’s not that tasty? Crickets. But that *is* approved by yoj billionaire biznitch overlords and their propaganda papers like VF:  https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-bill-gates-advised-eating-crickets-stay-healthy-1779291  Consider Vanity Fair has somehow had amazing insider coverage of the Gates’, their divorce, and been operating as basically PR for them, not shocked to see them pushing gates foundation propaganda.  Just Google “vanity fair gates” — see for yourself. ",Blarghnog,2025-05-06T14:06:58,6

I have to lose weight I gained after my last surgery for my next one. My diet sucked. I saw a professional nutritionist and found my diet was carb heavy and protein deficient. They designed a higher protein diet for me which also cut carbs/sugar and I have lost 20 lbs in 16 days. Protein is NECESSARY since humans pretty much evolved on it.

"It’s a slow trickle it more and more of the healthcare industry is realizing the old take of “fat bad - carbs good” was absolute garbage.  They saw cholesterol clogging arteries - so it’s absolutely understandable that the narrative they eating cholesterol is bad.     What we’ve realized is meat and fat is good, unprocessed or barely processed **whole grains**, and other carbs with a **low glycemic index**  are the carbs we need.  The issue has been sugars and processed carbs like white bread, white bread has a higher glycemic index than cane sugar. These foods are also calorie dense, so folks don’t feel full when they’ve had enough calories, so the body never gets the “ok, I’m full, stop eating” signal. And they’re addictive.    When we eat all those blood sugar spiking carbs, we develop body inflammation, which hits everything - and is now considered the precursor to cardiovascular diseases.",cliffotn,2025-05-06T11:04:05,50

"Smoke from charcoal is a carcinogen and it will penetrate the food. Also high temp grilling can cause carcinogens in the food itself. Any black charred bits should not be eaten.   Smoking meat (not using charcoal) is one of the healthiest. Then stewing.   They’re currently researching marinades, since those reduce the amount of carcinogens in high temp cooking.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-06T14:49:22,-3
