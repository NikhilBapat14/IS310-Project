"Just to illustrate how completely Trump has Co-opted democratic powers and taken Fascistic power for himself - so far this year the Congress has passed only two bills and three continuing resolutions - in four months.  They have totally abdicated their power to make laws.  While, Trump, in his first 90 days wrote 130 executive orders - orders which are not supposed to have the power of laws, but anyone who disobeys, is subject to having their funding cut, their jobs eliminated, their schools closed, their broadcast licenses revoked, or maybe they will just be disappeared to a prison cell in a foreign country without a trial?  Even the tariffs - on virtually every country in the world (except Russia of course) - those are not being done to balance trade.  If Trump wanted to balance trade he would not be sabotaging most of the U.S. primary sources of export income - like Tourism and selling world class educations to foreign students.  What Trump really wants the tariffs for is to force every major private corporation to bend the knee to him or be forced out of business when their competitors get tariff exemptions and they do not.  Makes me want to scream - some people still can not see what is happening.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T18:45:48,7
"**Summary**: Twelve U.S. states have sued the Trump administration, calling its tariff policy unlawful and economically damaging. They argue Trump overstepped his authority by imposing tariffs under emergency powers without congressional approval. The lawsuit seeks to block the tariffs, which they claim harm businesses and families.    **The 12 States** are: Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.",pharrt,2025-04-23T18:31:17,3
So when do these court cases start?  I keep hearing about them but then nothing.  What's going on?,Nateleb1234,2025-04-23T19:52:13,0
"üèÜüèÜüèÜ  It had never occurred to me that T would use tariff exemption to bring corporations into his mire. It is  a truly terrifying prospect to imagine. I hope you're wrong, but my immediate reaction to reading your comment was a gut sinking feeling that left me thinking ""They're spot on about this.""",church-rosser,2025-04-23T20:29:53,3

"Trump has his desires and his whims and he has the advice and direction of those who would make the U.S. into a Fascist country.  But there are also those who oppose him and his own incompetencies that stand in his way.  Much goes on behind closed doors and most of us know little of what happens there.  [Trump hosts Walmart, Target and Home Depot CEOs for tariff meeting](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-host-walmart-ceo-target-home-depot-execs-wh-tariff-meeting-rcna202212).  At first I assumed these major importers were summoned to the oval office to kiss Trump's ring - but after seeing Trump's comments today about easing tariffs against China, I now suspect these three came together in solidarity to issue to Trump a warning.  They warned him of how badly it was about to look to Americans when major stores started to have empty shelves as a result of tariffs so high that they amounted to bans against trade.  I think that image of empty shelves got through to Trump at least a little bit.  The road back to democracy is by no means certain - but neither is our descent into Fascism complete - at least not yet.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-23T23:15:49,1
