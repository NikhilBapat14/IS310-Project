Yeahh that's a no from almost everyone. This is potentially damaging to the future of the Republican Party. I know that it's trolling and people find it funny but Trump needs to consider the future of the party and the Republican candidate's chances in 2028. Because this isn't helping anything or anyone. It's doing the opposite of helping.,kelvarnsen1603,2025-04-24T22:04:55,372

Not at all. The truth is Trump is a unique figure whose ability to get typical non voters to vote is just that. Unique. And there’s been zero electoral evidence so far that this is transferable to other people.  The candidates he’s attached himself to so far in elections that matter have been garbage. And you can’t honestly tell me that the guy who told people not to vote in the 2020 senate election has a solid vision on being a party leader. And “trolling” like this isn’t the easiest campaign material for fear mongering democrats.  Look. I’m glad Trump won.

"Allowing the President to serve extra terms because of war sets an *extremely* dangerous precedent - it essentially incentivizes a President who desires more terms to have the United  States be at war.  Sure, the U.S. being the at war when FDR was President was just, because the U.S. was attacked, so you can give him a pass here. But it'd be foolish to assume there will *never* ever be a President, who'd be willing to be involved in an unjust war or start one.  Constitutional term limits are correct, there should not be an exception for war, and in fact, term limits should also be applied to Congress -- I would suggest max. six terms in the House, plus max. two terms in the Senate (i.e. 12 years per chamber).",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-25T12:54:15,-19

"I'm aware of a strawman argument. You are making the case in your initial comment that I am a liberal through the facetious ""... fellow conservatives."" There is no need to troll anyone in politics and considering Trump has stated he's looking into this multiple times, my willingness to believe it is all jest is expended. Further, deconstructing my comment as ""ZOMG the Constitution"" is at best a bad faith argument. The Constitution is the highest law of the land, and to openly flaunt something that most conservatives rightly hold as sacrosanct, should draw suspicion at minimum from the conservatives who support him. Then stating, that if he were to violate that Constitution, I would oppose him and join with the liberals in doing so makes me a liberal is a false equivalency.    If we wish to argue intellectual faculties, one needs to look no further than your ad hominem attacks, your dismissal of my arguments as autistic screeching, your inability to finish quotation marks, your inability to conjugate contractions, or the fact that you once again end with a false equivalency of a leftist larper or a ""fucking moron"" as evidence of who entered this battle of wits unarmed.   I leave you with my favorite Stephen Decatur quote as modified by General, later Senator, Carl Shurz, and a reflection on it. ""It is our country, right or wrong, if right, to be kept right; and if wrong, to be set right."" It is our party and our President, right or wrong. If right, to be kept right; and if wrong, it is our duty to speak out and set it right. I pray for the success of President Trump. I think he may do a lot of good, but he is not doing a lot of good when he flaunts the laws upon which our country is built as things that need not apply.",Twogunkid,2025-04-25T16:12:18,37
