"Caesar spent 10 years illegally committing atrocities against tribal Celts because he knew the moment he stepped foot in Rome, he’d be prosecuted. So when he came back, he came back with an army. Literally the most famous story of an authoritarian criminal taking over a democracy, and we’re just letting it happen again.",literatekinda,2025-04-07T18:51:56,6
"Excerpt:  Trump is creating national emergencies to gain more power. In the process, he’s subjecting millions to real harm.  Make no mistake about what’s really going on here. While the United States has plenty of real problems to deal with, Trump is ignoring them to manufacture the fake emergencies he needs to further enlarge and centralize his power.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-07T18:28:50,6
"Supreme Court just ruled that Trump can use the Alien Emergencies Act, but only on the condition that a) people are given the heads up first and b) suspects have a right to plead their case.  In other words, they get Due Process.  This isn't a win for Trump, despite what some may be saying.   The Supreme Court once again ruled that the case was held in the wrong jurisdiction and said to bring it back to the proper court. Once again, not really a win for Trump here, although if the case is heard in Texas it might go in Trump's favor, but the SCOTUS ruling that suspects get Due Process is now law.   As for the declaring trade a national emergency, I dunno.  A lot of people are coming out against this.",crucial_geek,2025-04-07T20:03:45,3
