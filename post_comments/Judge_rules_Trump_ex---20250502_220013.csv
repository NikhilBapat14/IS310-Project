">Snippet:  >A federal judge ruled Friday that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it.  >In a [102-page decision](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.185.0.pdf), U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of the firm and said Mr. Trump's directive that sought to punish it sent the message that ""lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.""   >""Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution, which requires that the government respond to dissenting or unpopular speech or ideas with 'tolerance, not coercion,'"" Howell wrote.  >She found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth and Sixth amendments to the Constitution.  >*The decision from Howell, who sits on the U.S. district court in Washington, D.C., is the first summary ruling in one of four cases brought by law firms that have been penalized by the president as a result of their associations with people and causes he disfavors. In addition to Perkins Coie, the firms Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey have also filed lawsuits challenging their respective executive orders.*",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T22:01:12,18
Of course tRumps executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional. All his EOs targeting the other law firms are also illegal. tRump needs to be impeached!,Harry_Mud,2025-05-02T22:10:12,5

"It’s almost like we should have some sort of process to deal with a president that repeatedly violates the constitution. I mean the president swears an oath to the constitution, almost like he should be tried for perjury and removed from office. I’ll come up with something, uh peaches?

I find it unbelievable how many firms decided to cave instead of winning a cut-and-dry court case that would raise their prestige and earn them clients from the headlines.,enjoycarrots,2025-05-02T22:04:03,42
"No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit,” Howell wrote “targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: ‘The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.’”",M1Garrand,2025-05-02T23:08:21,9
"This ruling is a banger. Instant classic, hall of fame.  Where's the MAGA ""muh constitution"" supporters?  > No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” When Shakespeare’s character, a rebel leader intent on becoming king hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of his plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding “[a]way with him,” referring to an educated clerk, who “can make obligations and write court hand"" Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the  path to more power. See Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24  (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be “that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government”).  > In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase “Let’s kill all the lawyers,” EO 14230 takes the approach of “Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like,” sending the clear message: lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.  > Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish  certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution  > Executive Order 14230 is unconstitutional",Out_of_the_Bloo,2025-05-03T02:58:09,5
Trump doesn’t have to comply. All this means is that the remaining ethical people in the executive branch are not bound by this order.,rotates-potatoes,2025-05-02T22:17:49,11

"That’s the things- everyone knows he doesn’t care about the constitution and is knowingly and intentionally violating it.   But he’s not going to do anything different. So how many times will he ignore courts, and people yell ‘constitutional crisis!’ with zero consequences or change?   Nothing is happening before the midterms. ",Belle_Requin,2025-05-02T22:22:08,3
"Unless I'm mistaken, I believe two Democrats have  filed articles of impeachment against Trump.  Rep Al Green (TX) and recently  Rep.

"It sickens me but I understand it. If you told a big law firm that they were persona non grata with regard to the SEC, FTC and other institutions they would hemorrhage clients overnight. If you’re a bank and the SEC won’t play nice with your outside counsel you get new outside counsel. I hate how quickly the firms capitulated since they’re one of the few categories of entities with the resources to fight back, but they were put in a pretty precarious position. I don’t even think the reputational impact will be that great - their customers are (generally) not the man on the street but large organizations who often care more about profits than morality.",irishnugget,2025-05-02T23:29:25,1
">Where's the MAGA ""muh constitution"" supporters?  Every time they claim to support something, they are unmitigated liars. The only thing they support is having power and control over others.  They only ""supported"" the Constitution when they thought it would support their agenda.

"Except now, those firms that kowtowed to Trump are losing attorneys and having issues recruiting new ones. Not to mention the clients that have dumped the firms.  For example: Microsoft dumps law firm that caved to Trump EO and signed with a firm that's fighting against their targeted EO: https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-swaps-law-firms-shareholder-case-hiring-trump-adversary-2025-05-01/",Predator_,2025-05-03T01:47:41,5
"Good points. Of relevance, Perkins doesn't really have a regulatory practice (they are more of a transactions firm). So that may be part of why they felt more comfortable fighting back.",gradientz,2025-05-03T00:17:54,2
