"Looking at the headline my first thought was that this was likely a story about a Zionist. Maybe that's a bit harsh but after reading the article I didn't change my mind. In it celebrated historian of antisemitism Deborah Lipstadt praises Trump for moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. That seems like something of an indicator for a person's views on the rights of Palestinians.   For myself, I have no trouble believing that there are Jewish students who are feeling unwelcome and unsafe at universities. Just as there are Palestinian students who feel the same. And Black students. And trans students. And so on. But I have a lot of trouble believing the Trump Administration gives a fuck about any of them. This is just a politically expedient way for the Trumpies to attack institutions their political base hates.   It's scapegoating. And for a historian of antisemitism to express support for that, even with the qualifications she offers in the article, is sad.",yo2sense,2025-04-23T06:16:22,12
"The right wing is playing our standards against us. Elon musk is throwing Nazi salutes while Trump was all about parroting Hitler during the election.  They’re deporting non white detractors, that they may or may not be antisemites isn’t why trump is doing this. This is a show of force and a return to americas racist roots.  Not a blow against antisemitism.  Nazis were waving trump flags, not Biden/Harris flags.  This is more of a “first they came for” situation.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-23T06:43:09,3

"If you read the interview it's hardly that.   These are not softball questions.  > **Question:** If people are close to antisemites, or part of a party that’s awash in antisemitism, or working for a man who dines with white supremacists and says really gross things about Jews, it makes me think that if they’re pro-Israel you give them slack that you wouldn’t if people were doing the same thing but were not pro-Israel. > > **Answer:** No, no, no, no, no, no. > > Look, the universities failed to address this seriously. And by failing to address this seriously, they failed the Jewish students on campus. They dismissed their grievances. They created an inhospitable atmosphere. We’re now seeing the fruits of that failure. What disturbs me so much is that the debate will now become over whether antisemitism is being used as a weapon to fight against people we don’t like. Antisemitism should not be a cudgel.",yo2sense,2025-04-23T06:17:18,2
