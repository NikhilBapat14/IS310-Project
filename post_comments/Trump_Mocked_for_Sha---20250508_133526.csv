"He is an idiot. He doesn't read. He doesn't want to learn. He is uneducated and resistant to learning. History repulses him. He merely reacts to stimuli; he saw a picture he liked and used it.

He put tariffs on an uninhabited island that only had penguins. Him not knowing where Iwo Jima is shouldn’t be much of a surprise.,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-08T14:35:47,60
"Excluding the fact that it was the war in Europe that ended on the 8th of May 1945 and not WW2 as a while (Japan surrendered on the 2nd of September 1945), this is a gross misrepresentation of the contribution of the rest of the forces of the Entente (plus its allies) and of the Allies that made enormous sacrifices without which neither World War would have the conclusion it had.

"One of the most despicable parts of this is the Trump administration deleted DoD webpages honoring Ira Hayes, one of the Marines who raised the flag at Iwo Jima, for being “DEI” because they referenced his Pima Indian heritage.

"Look, I don’t wanna be guy. Cause I really hate the guy we’re talking about here.   But bashing him over the stupidest shit like this is not productive. It’s annoying know-it-all-ism that undermines the very real criticisms people place on him.

His staff are afraid of losing their jobs or worse if they try to correct him. He is like a toddler and requires 24 7 supervision which is not a trait you want for someone in his position.

Because I genuinely believe he thinks those alphabetic characters are there.  And it couldn’t be any more obvious that they are not  Doesn’t make him any better of a person. Hes been a piece of shit since long before his faculties started to go. But he’s not a puppet master. He’s chaos being wielded by the people around him to the best of their ability.
