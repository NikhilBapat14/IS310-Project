When you've already bought and done everything you've ever wanted I guess having more money becomes meaningless at some point. Might as well give it away then.,Uller85,2025-05-08T09:23:24,665

Is it even possible to give away 99% of a $150 billion fortune? That much money is generating so much more money it seems the only way to do it would be in a lump sum.,jeon2595,2025-05-08T12:44:25,29

"Other than virtue signaling, what's the point of announcing it with such fanfare?   He could have just included it in his will without the need of everyone pretending how great of a guy he is.

"Are you high?  That would only be equal to about $5000 per person.  People in ""poverty"" in the country get waaaay more than that in benefits.  How on earth do you think that would ""eliminate"" poverty?  A single mom with a few kids living in ""poverty"" can bank over $40k in benefits every year.  In fact, every damn billionaire in the country can give every dime to their name as a donation to the government and welfare payments would suck it all up dry in mere months.

"Yeah exactly. What's good about free markets is they largely direct capital to capable business people who've survived the arena. Who can then accomplish more, and the consumer/country benefits.
