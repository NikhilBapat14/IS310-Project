"A new issue of the Hoover Digest features a wealth of research insights and analysis from across the Hoover Institution Fellowship. Economist [Raghuram Rajan](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/raghuram-rajan) leads the issue with a reminder that “trade, investment, and migration made the world prosperous,” arguing that “[Isolationism Is Not ‘Great’](https://www.hoover.org/research/isolationism-not-great).” In “[A Last Chance for Fiscal Sanity](https://www.hoover.org/research/last-chance-fiscal-sanity),” [John Cogan](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/john-f-cogan) proposes that President Trump has a “fleeting opportunity” to push for meaningful spending reforms in the name of national security. Senior Fellow (adjunct) and Nobel Laureate [Michael Spence](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/michael-spence) [considers the role of trust](https://www.hoover.org/research/trust-busters) and perception in communicating narratives about the economy. And Science and Senior Fellow [Drew Endy](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/drew-endy) speaks about the immense promise of biomanufacturing to revitalize the Rust Belt (and beyond) – and suggests how a biomanufacturing revolution could be financed and supported with innovative “[bio bonds](https://www.hoover.org/research/buy-biobonds).” ",HooverInstitution,2025-04-14T13:50:52,1
