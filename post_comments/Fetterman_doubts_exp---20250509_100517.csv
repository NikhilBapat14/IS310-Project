It isn't his main responsibility, but he does threaten his and his colleagues' effectiveness when he loses his composure talking to constituents or is credibly reported to be disoriented enough to wander into traffic.

"Here's a little personal experience and why I find this saga interesting.  My mom was a pediatrics nurse at the top pediatric hospital in the country.  Worked neonatal, pedsicu, labor and delivery.  They would airlift prgnant moms and babies to her hospital from all over the country.  My mom was extremely intelligent and liberal as she was ojibwe and grew up in a rez, and historically, Republicans treated them like shit.    My mom had a stroke in 2015.  Shortly after she started falling into social media shit and that was around when the q shit began and trump was running.  My mom quit talking to me because I said I'd support Hillary and i was surprised and confused about her support of trump and when I asked why it was the same regurgitated fox talking points.  Even when my dad died, on election day of all days, my mom wouldn't talk to me and spoke by proxy through my brother.    4 years go by, she wouldn't say a word to me, over Hillary Clinton lol.  My mom, again, intelligent nurse, then fell into anti Vax shit when covid began.  She ended up dying of covid during the delta outbreak.  It was the saddest shit, couldn't say goodbye, couldn't patch things up, couldn't even have a funeral at the time.  Over politics.  Over donald fucking trumps bitch ass.    Point is, I watched a stroke turn my liberal mom hyper conservative crazy.  Now I'm seeing this happen to Fetterman and it's really shocking because I never ever thought the stroke changed her.  Just blamed social media manipulation and fox.  Might have been social media and fox fault, but the stroke probably made her more susceptible to it.  I don't know much about how Fetterman was before, I hear he was centrist but slightly left, but seems like he's also gone far right and off the rails.  Hope he gets some help, and I hope people see this and research more into damage cause by strokes.  I also believe in karma, and one day, it's going to bite all their fascist dicks off, and I hope I just live long enough to see it.",crapperbargel,2025-05-09T14:05:30,97

Then in 2018 she had a stroke. Since then she has had consistent problems with being extremely gullible and naive, seemingly losing her ability to think critically. She is now a vocal supporter of Trump and watches every video put out by Candace Owens.   Though we still get along, it’s so disheartening to me, as someone who is a regulatory scientist to see this happen and have to hear her regurgitate MAGA propaganda especially about scientific topics and things to do with regulations and trade. She will listen to any conservative talking point but not to her own daughter.",Bored_Chemist521,2025-05-09T14:50:08,14
"I'm so sorry that happened. Unbelievably frustrating to watch that for someone who is Ojibwe. To watch her fall into agreement with power-hungry, narcissistic white men. As is they hadn't taken enough from her and her family already.    I absolutely think strokes, or even extreme stress events, can make older people susceptible to suggestion and less able to distinguish between truth and lies. I saw a tiny example of this with my dad, who is 75. He had surgery and was home resting when he got a call from a scammer. One of the ""buy a gift card and read me the back of it"" kinds. My dad is extremely wary of scammers - he's the one always sending the family emails warning of whatever new scam is out there. But that day - the day after surgery - he just ... went a long with everything they asked. Didn't even flinch. A couple of days later he recalled what had happened and was absolutely gobsmacked that he did such a thing. They got $1800 from him.    Similarly, another man I know I'm his late 60s became extremely confused and gullible after some emotional trauma. His son almost died and was in the hospital for a month fighting for his life. Since then, the dad has never been the same cognitively.   There's something to this brain trauma = susceptibility theory.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-09T19:55:31,4
"Studies have shown that conservatives have literally different brains than liberals.   They have larger/more active parts of the brain that control fear for example.  So conservatives truly do feel more fear over things than liberals.  So when your news feeds you fear based information it ignites that part of the brain and drives behavior.     So depending on what part of your brain is injured during a stroke, it absolutely can have fundamental changes in people's beliefs and behaviors.",No_Size9475,2025-05-09T21:17:21,3

After Trump lost in 2020 she was ranting how Trump was still in charge and God selected him to lead us all and there was going to be an uprising, etc. etc. etc.  She was convinced Pelosi and the dems were eating babies.
