"What a terrible headline.    It is not that ""ai oversight is lacking,"" this implies an audit recommended using more AI because the AI obersight itself was lacking.    Where, in fact, it is their ability to use AI and the use of AI for these purposes that was found lacking itself.   The oversight is lacking who's oversight? The AI's oversight.   Headline should read ""Audit Finds New York State Oversight of AI Systems Lacking."" Or some such.   > “Our audit found insufficient central guidance and oversight to check that these systems are reliable and accurate, and no inventory of what AI the state is using,” DiNapoli said. “Stronger governance over the state’s growing use of AI is needed to safeguard against the well-known risks that come with it.”   This does not match the headline.",NekuraHitokage,2025-04-07T16:36:12,1
