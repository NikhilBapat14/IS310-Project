"*AmeriCorps programs play an essential role in disaster recovery across the country. They helped communities hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton last fall, as well as after the Los Angeles wildfires in January, supporting shelter operations, managing call centers, volunteers and donations, mucking and gutting out buildings that were destroyed, cleaning up debris, and so much more. After Hurricane Maria devastated the island of Puerto Rico in 2017, AmeriCorps deployed its members to respond to the disaster and help recover and reconnect food delivery to communities across the island.*      Approximately 200,000 individuals participate in various roles annually, engaging in disaster response, aiding veterans, helping students, and providing meals to those in need.   If it benefits people, he will close it down.",SAJ-13,2025-04-25T08:51:01,6

"AmeriCorps and Ampact do some amazing things in assisting the community.   In addition to what the article listed, they also have programs like Reading Corps, Math Corps, Early Learning Corps, Recovery Corps, and Heading Home Corps to help the communities they serve in, *for free.*  I have no doubt there is a desire to monetize all this and milk even more money from the bottom 99%, with a focus on the bottom 50%, and funnel even more upwards.  Everything about the ""golden age of America"" people like to get teary-eyed about when nostalgia-tripping stems from *not* doing shit like this. Having a *sensible* tax policy. From having robust institutions, protections, regulations, and support systems.   Not from fleecing workers, customers, and everyone but the shareholders and execs, and from not trying to maximize profit on *everything* to the detriment of *everyone* but those shareholders, execs, and the already grotesquely wealthy.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-25T09:32:42,6
"They do great work, we have a branch in my city... One thing they do is mentor youth. It will be a shame if it goes away.",SAJ-13,2025-04-25T09:38:37,4
"I worked for Recovery Corps one time. Not only did I get to help people out of the same hopeless-feeling situation I was in at one time, and support them radically changing the course of their lives, but I received a 7.5k educational allotment. If I had done another term, I'd have gotten *another* 7.5k allotment.  All of their programs are a benefit to society. There's no reason to cut them other than state-sanctioned embezzlement.",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-25T09:46:50,1
