"> in hopes they can convince Republicans to beef up the bill’s provisions on national security and consumer protection.   There's your problem.   >“I have a sense that this is caught up in other issues,” Lummis said. Fellow stablecoin bill sponsor Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., was more blunt, calling the statement “ridiculous” and “a huge foul.”  >Kara Calvert, who helms US policy for crypto exchange Coinbase, echoed Lummis in concluding that the bill has gotten swept up “into something that is a much larger political issue.”   It's funny that Republicans claim to want restricted stock trading but not crypto for Dear Leader. Rug pulls can make insanely more money than putting it in the stock market (e.g. his last two coins).   > many of the Democrats’ requested edits are related to other issues — like policing stablecoin firms based outside the US — rather than addressing potential conflicts of interest within the administration.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T17:18:27,12
"From Semafor's Eleanor Mueller and Burgess Everett:  Democrats are shifting their strategy for opposition-party policymaking in real time this week. And they’re using a fight over cryptocurrency, a topic very important to President Donald Trump.  Nine pro-crypto Democratic senators are withholding their votes for legislation that would create rules for stablecoins — a type of crypto pegged to assets like the US dollar — in hopes they can convince Republicans to beef up the bill’s provisions on national security and consumer protection.  “If changes aren’t made — not only will I vote no, but I’ll urge all my colleagues to vote no,” Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told Semafor.  The rebellion comes as progressives escalate their criticisms of the Trump family’s crypto business after it reportedly struck a deal with an Emirati firm. It also comes with the blessing of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, whose caucus has clearly learned from its painful divisions earlier this year over immigration in January and government funding in March.  Democrats are still torn over crypto, whose Senate allies are fighting to insulate the stablecoin bill from progressive colleagues’ concerns over the president’s conflicts of interest: “Doing nothing is not a logical reaction to Trump,” bill sponsor Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told Semafor.  But Schumer worked this week to unify his caucus around demanding changes to the bill rather than letting Democrats splinter on the first floor vote. After persistent fury from the left over his handling of government funding, he’s taken a firmer hand on crypto and openly sided with progressives — what may be a taste of things to come this year as the party takes advantage of the filibuster, its last leverage over Trump’s agenda.
