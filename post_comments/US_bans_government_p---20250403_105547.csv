How could this ever be legal? When did we start having laws about who we can or can't be in a relationship with in 2025!,Lebarican22,2025-04-03T10:56:39,16
"Given how the CCP LOVES to use cheap nefarious methods like honeypotting for various geopolitical, espionage and economic purposes, this is fine.  The CCP actively and internally(for their domestic market)pushes the narrative that they are in an existential war with the USA.  They should be treated in a reciprocal manner.  Just my 2 cents.",alex13389,2025-04-03T12:55:03,3

"It's basically the same kind of thing that some businesses have about not allowing employees to date each other. It's not that they face any legal repercussions, they just lose their job.

"The whole idea is that there have always been and will always be ""honey pots"" - foreign agents who purposely seduce citizens of a country that they want intel on. These are American government employees with access to classified information. They don't want a cute lil Chinese spy getting information out of them. It's all in the article.",Frickin_Brat,2025-04-03T13:18:39,1
