"Dont give medals. Simply make all healthcare for minors and pregnant women free, all public schools free, and make childcare affordable by sponsoring kindergartens so parents pay max 600$ a year. Give a year parental leave with strong protections from loosing the job - and make that so the father/non birth-giving parent has to do half or simply loose free time off.  Oh, and create a stable political environment that makes people feel safe and supported by the government. Make it BORING.",HelpfulPhrase5806,2025-04-22T11:33:46,105

">The League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Mädel [BDM]) was the female section of the Hitler Youth, its role was to indoctrinate girls into the beliefs and ideals of the Nazi regime.  The BDM focused on developing girls into women who were dedicated to Nazism, dutiful housewives, and whose role within in society was to become a mother. Girls were to grow-up with an unquestioning understanding of the intended role of women in the Third Reich. BDM members were required to have German parents, be in good health, and conform to Nazi racial ideals.  Orange Lebensborn on its way to a town near you.",ChickpeaDemon,2025-04-22T13:28:05,5

Many countries all over the world have extensive incentives for having children and it makes little to no difference in the stats. The fact is that less people are coupling or getting married. Many women can’t find suitable mates until they are too old to have children. In places like S Korea a large percentage of women don’t even date anymore and swear off men. Same in the US. The problem is less about economics and more about the culture issues of hetero relationships.,tyler77,2025-04-22T16:03:22,0
