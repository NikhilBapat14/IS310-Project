I thought it was Trump jacking Putin around the corner. It’s not gay if we don’t make eye contact,Interesting-Arm-6653,2025-05-01T22:31:33,10

"Kennedy might be floating the idea as a trial balloon for the GOP.  If so, this would be a refreshing change in direction.  Otherwise it's just more of the same BS.   From day one, there have only been two outcomes for this conflict.  The crux issue is Putin's ambition to restore the Russian/Soviet empire to former greatness.  Either that dream gets crushed or it doesn't.        Crushing it requires a resounding Russian defeat (possibly followed by a short walk out a high window) that resonates in Russian society for generations.  Not crushing it, our current path, means endless wars in Europe.  You can't give a bully what he wants and expect him to not ask for more.  Churchill understood this.  Reagan understood it.  Trump?  He admires Putin's style.       With only a bit of Reagan-like pressure Trump could tip the balance and go down in history as a great leader. I suspect the old-guard Reagan worshipers are floating that idea in hopes of salvaging something.  They are rightly wondering why we can't have greatness instead of this diaper-baby golf capitulation.    Remember this gem?    [https://youtu.be/UaVWRetR4jg](https://youtu.be/UaVWRetR4jg)  And this one?   [https://youtu.be/nqhmtzG-OK4](https://youtu.be/nqhmtzG-OK4)  We were warned.",guttanzer,2025-05-01T22:48:44,8

"Aaaaand, people are just now figuring this out. Uh, Putin was the head of the KGB - so clearly he understands a bit about psychology and how to play people.

"*""I think he thinks we're afraid of him,"" the Louisiana senator said of the Russian leader. ""He has jacked around President Trump at every turn. He has disrespected our president.""*  No kidding, dude,   And Trump is afraid of Putin. When your ego and your real estate empire are innately intertwined, Putin doing to a few of your buildings what he did in Buynaksk, Moscow and Volgodonsk in 1999 is a major threat.",AdHopeful3801,2025-05-02T08:46:31,2

"Even if those tapes ever existed, it's blatantly obvious by now that they wouldn't make a blind bit of difference. They could have tapes of Trump rawdogging a baby and he wouldn't lose a single voter  If you're thinking ""so how is he so compliant"" it's a standard cold war intelligence tactic. They stroked his ego. Pretty straightforward with someone as basic and shallow as Trump",The_300_goats,2025-05-02T05:13:59,6

"That motherfucker is the Daily Show's 'moment of zen' like once a month b/c he goes on fox news and says 'I wasn't born yesterday but I know a hound dog licks his owns balls.'  The thing is, we know he's not a moron.  I watched him grill a judicial nominee who was totally unqualified and Kennedy just hit him with 101 law stuff and the guy folded.  But when Kennedy had a chance to question Kavanaugh, he asked 'do you believe in god?'  That's was it.  I'll never respect anyone that essentially says 'only god can judge you.'
