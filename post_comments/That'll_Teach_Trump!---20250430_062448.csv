"As a Canadian, I‚Äôm still shocked half of the country still voted liberal after a decade of having a liberal government and party in charge dig us into the ground. People here are clueless.",BigHotdog2009,2025-04-30T09:36:18,209
It's hilarious that Trump has so much pull. Voters in other countries voted based on the president of another country.,Towjumper173,2025-04-30T07:31:47,314
Carney repealed the Carbon Tax.  That means he totally isn't the same Liberal Party taxing them to death and selling out their interests abroad. /s,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-30T07:28:05,149

"Get right, Canada does not want these useless fucks in power. The liberals have rigged the election by adding lots of extra seats in locations that historically vote liberal.

"According to my Canadian friend, he didn‚Äôt repeal it. All they did was ‚Äúset it to 0%‚Äù so it won‚Äôt away for the time being. Nothing stopping them from upping the numbers now.",OseanFederation,2025-04-30T11:48:14,24
"We aren't all the same  I voted con. Everyone is know, all my family, all my workplace voted con.  My entire neighborhood overall decided on con.  But toronto and Montreal fucked it all right up. Think of them as your California: i wouldn't blame all of america for the actions of one state and neither should you blame all of us for the delusions of the urbanites.",TalosSquancher,2025-04-30T07:15:23,243
"The tweets had nothing to do with it. Canada has been leftist for many decades. There was no way they were going to vote conservative. Anybody who tells you differently was lying, deluding themselves, or just trying to pile on against Trump.

They were actually gaslit into believing Trump is Hitler and Pierre is just another Trump so therefore also Hitler lol.  Wild to think the older generation of Canadians don‚Äôt care about the future of Canada. Not only are they stupid. They‚Äôre selfish.,BigHotdog2009,2025-04-30T15:13:44,64
Yeah I don‚Äôt think people realize that Ontario and Quebec determine our elections the majority of the time. Like you said it would be like if LA and NYC determining who wins the U.S. it‚Äôs fucked.,BigHotdog2009,2025-04-30T15:12:24,19

Good luck to you.  I hope you can shield yourself from the worst of it.",LK_Feral,2025-04-30T08:34:24,34
"Don't misunderstand, I blame Canada for nothing and love the people.  Its just hard to feel sympathy.  Same way it's hard to feel sympathy for states like Colorado that are mostly rural but whose states are dominated by the voting of disconnected liberal urban centers that are hopelessly dependent upon the government.  I can't wrap my mind around people who would allow Trump's trolling to influence them so dramatically as to forget what the past 5 years looked like under Trudeau.    It is what it is, but I'll refuse to pay $7 for a bag of ketchup flavored potato chips.  They are good, but not that good.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-30T08:28:00,22
I was in grad school during the last election and our student body was 60%ish canadian. EVERYONE WAS PISSED.,Daniel_Day_Hubris,2025-04-30T09:02:55,4
"Actually they made a big difference. The MSM picked it as their gravy train and the Boomers ate the whole thing up. ''Dealing with Trump'' polled as their #1 priority by far. Meanwhile, young people's main preoccupation was ''being able to afford to live''. Carney said ''Trump'' 37 times during the debate to boost TDS as much as possible.  I don't blame Trump, but he made a huge difference.",winterbike,2025-04-30T12:33:06,25

"The best argument against democracy is the Asch conformity and Milgram experiments. Rather it debunks the notion that general democracies measure the will of the people. If you ask a child a political question are they really giving you their opinion or someone else's? That's basically what democracy has devolved to in its current form in the west. The side that consolidates power is able to give themselves millions of proxy votes via their control of the institutions of indoctrination. And this doesn't even include their ability to change who can vote and how, by changing the rules and importing new voters who will vote as they want.  Elections should poll people proportional to their stake and incentive/ability to offer their own opinion rather than be a proxy of someone else's. Interestingly we already know the system to do this but we routinely reject it in favor of a people's republic (in name only). It's called a market where people get to vote every day with their wallet, and under the correct framework this determines the will of the people on issues with far more accuracy than so called democracy. Which is why the ruling class is so intent on rigging the market, and where they can't moving as many decisions as possible from it to the government.",day25,2025-04-30T09:08:05,35

"Nah man, you could have used the context clues to figure it out on your own instead of assuming party colors are universal instead of country specific and that the person you were replying to is wrong about how their own country works.  Edit: vague terms? Unless you didn't know where Toronto was, you had all the context you needed to figure it out, it ain't hard. I know you probably won't see this though because you blocked me immediately after replying.",Doctor_Byronic,2025-04-30T10:45:45,68
Or the person I was replying to could have just said liberal and conservative instead of writing in vague ambiguous terms. Especially since they didn't state whether or not they're Canadian.  But feel feel free to keep white-knighting for them. They probably still won't sleep with you.,Original_Lord_Turtle,2025-04-30T11:50:32,-35
