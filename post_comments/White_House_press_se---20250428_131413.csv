A fifth round draft pick to the Browns is not a flex for someone of the stature of Shedeur. Itâ€™s the equivalent of a pity pass.,EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T13:16:15,53
So the guy projected round 1 and absolutely no later than round 2 winds up nearly lasting until the 6th round--and Trump demands we acknowledge his huge success.  The stupidity of authoritarianism never ceases to amaze.,demystifier,2025-04-28T13:17:25,26

"Makes Truth Social posts complaining that he didn't get drafted in the first round, and then celebrates that he played a role in having him drafted in the fifth round.  Truly delusional",geoffvro,2025-04-28T13:56:33,3

Sanders was picked 4 rounds after Trumpâ€™s Truth post. I hardly think Trump had anything to do with it. But of course he and his fucking parrot of a press secretary thinks he had everything to do with it.,CJDistasio,2025-04-28T13:25:05,3

"You know, in a normal presidency, this would actually be great humor.  ""Yeah, the president used his power to get this guy drafted. He has a direct line to Goodells office you know.

"Itâ€™s so ridiculous that they think Trump having a say in who gets drafted in NFL is some kind of achievement. IF thatâ€™s true, just throw it on pile of crazy shit thatâ€™s going on. The president shouldnâ€™t have say in anything like that, and shouldnâ€™t even have to point that out",Green_Tomato_7444,2025-04-28T14:07:07,1
"Still pissed they wouldn't let him into their club.  And still a crappy businessman.  The USFL of Presidents.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_and_American_football  ""Instead, Trump believed that buying a team in the newly founded United States Football League (USFL) would yield a much higher return on investment for a lower purchase cost.[21]'""  ""Several news sources have called Trump's decision to not buy the Cowboys for $50 million to be a business blunder, as the franchise would go on to be first on Forbes' list of the most valuable sports teams, with a 2024 valuation of $10.1 billion.[23]""   What's his goal this time?  ""His entire goal was to get him an NFL team. He didn't care how he got it. ... His goal was to get in the NFL. If it took a merger, so be it. If it took the entire USFL collapsing and he gets an [NFL] team, that's fine too"" Jeff Pearlman, speaking to Newsweek in 2017 about Trump's goal as a USFL team owner[17]",backpackwasmypillow,2025-04-28T14:20:38,1

The President just called NFL owners..pick Sanders or else.. pathetic. But more pathetic is our country has come to this..,Brief_Night_9239,2025-04-28T18:59:41,1
So he's the fifth quarterback. He's gonna get cut in four months.  It would have genuinely been better for Sanders to go undrafted. He'd have more freedom for where he goes and the ability to ingratiate himself with the coaching staff before they start cutting down the roster.,OneWholeBen,2025-04-28T21:01:02,1

"They picked Dillon Gabriel in front of him.   Now, Dillon Gabriel is a good player and good guy but heâ€™s like 5â€™9. Many would say thatâ€™s borderline unplayable in the NFL.  And they picked him in front of Shadeur.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-28T13:18:35,14

"I don't think that's exactly true. Past presidents and press corps have made jokes and sarcastic digs before.  Obama, ""I will say to the Cubs, It took you long enough. I've only got 4 days left.""   This hits different though, doesn't it? Like, even if we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, (which he no longer deserves) we can't tell if they're joking or not.
