I wish. A chunk do support him - a minority but not a negligible one. Not only the US has a crazy MAGA-similar right wing,AndreasDasos,2025-04-28T16:46:14,3
Where are these 14% coming from?  Do they view him favourably because they see him as uniting Canada?  Cause I don't know a single person that views him favourably (there are some that thinks he's a joke).,White_Meteor,2025-04-28T15:18:44,9

"poilievre is anti trump tariffs despite otherwise being conservative and somewhat reminiscent of trump = poilievre is functionally anti-trump because he's going to fight trump and trump tariffs, or no? i'm anti-trump, youre anti trump, we're both anti-trump. on this one, im just trying to make fun of trump's tweet. why is he appealing to both sides of the canadian vote? one thing they both agree on is fighting trump and his trump tariffs. there isnt a side there that trump can get something out of by appealing to them to vote trump. theyre definitely both voting anti-trump. right? or do i have it wrong? im not canadian but this is what little i thought i understood about the two canadian positions as of today? both of them now have to be anti-trump because he's become so aggressive against canada that all canadians are against him? what i mean is, isnt trump's tweet definitely just taunting both sides of canada, because it's obvious that he's losing his ""join u.s.a"" campaign against them? showing that: trump is on the verge of losing his own u.s. office, right now. he's right on the edge of it. you can tell because he's having pure-meltdown moments like this. ?
