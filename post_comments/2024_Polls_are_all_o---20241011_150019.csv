Trump has gotten even crazier if that's a change?  I think the election is not as close as the media does. I am having a difficult time believing there are more angry white folks in america than the rest of us put together.,braindeaths,2024-10-22T06:24:37,5
"Part of the problem is the disconnect that people think all Harris voters are similar to each other, and all Trump voters are similar. There might be some vague topics they all share, but there are a vast range of things people are saying as reasons they are voting.  I'd have to say both sides are pretty entrenched in their bubbles. The majority of people mostly knew if they were gonna vote blue or red a while ago. Thus, if any information comes out, it can easily be dismissed as propaganda or tampering.   Hopefully, people are at least consistent in thinking all polls are bs whether their candidate is winning or losing. Or believe the polls regardless of if their candidate is winning or losing. It can't be (if information is good for my side=true, if information bad = false)",oiledupnik,2024-10-25T09:31:19,2
"Harris support at the beginning was manufactured and a honeymoon phase. Now that people understand who the candidates are and have listened to them the support is going to normal levels. This was always gonna happen when new candidates are added.  Polls are not a great way to judge support and can be easily manipulated, you can see that by both sides. People want to make excuses for the opposing candidate doing good in certain polls when it is just over sampling or selective areas sampled.  The biggest issue with Kamala is that she was never popular and Biden/Harris administration has been bad in many key issues. Her having the lowest approval rating of any VP and serious issues with immigration, prices and foreign relations have been blasted by the right which is hurting a lot. She hasn't given any reason why her presidency would be any better than her VP administration and people now have the time cross analysis these issues.",SuspiciousBook808,2024-10-18T19:09:11,1
"I don't think there was real momentum for Harris. Their campaign dumped a ton of money into social media to help generate the notion that there was momentum, but now that's dying off, and the actual person's feelings about the election are showing.",[deleted],2024-10-19T11:03:58,1
Do you think it's better if the polls are manufactured as winning or losing help the candidate? Since we have had people lose in the past where polling was high for them and the reverse situation.,oiledupnik,2024-10-25T09:27:15,1
"Yeah this seems to make sense on my end.  I've been reading polls that tend to state that most people made up their mind on who to vote for a month ago (or more) - so it stands to reason that September polls are a more accurate picture of the race than October polls are (to say nothing of the glut of red funded trash polls skewing the averages.)  It isn't all polls, there are tons of other factors and indicators of support that matter.",CloudsTasteGeometric,2024-10-25T10:15:23,1
"Also I'd say most people probably wouldn't even answer polls? I know I don't accept random phone calls on my phone or return text messages about polling questions. Do you?  I feel like even though this country has been pretty divided into 2 main groups, there are so many individual groups that are hard to generalize based off a small %.  That's kind of a big issue I'd say is some view a candidate as preaching to them as if they are not an individual with individual thoughts,  but must think similar to people of the same skin color, gender, culture, sexual orientation, education, profession or whatever.   If you are looking for hope with the polls, then I promise that even though you might have some or all rights taken away federally, you still have so much power locally and can change your situation. Work with your community and don't let people tell you that you are responsible for every other person in the world.",oiledupnik,2024-10-25T11:05:16,1
