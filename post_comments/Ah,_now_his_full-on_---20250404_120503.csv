He became a Christian born again warrior in the Trump loving MAGA cult army and it was probably a calculated move to get support for what he saw coming at him like a freight train…my opinion anyway.,beavis617,2025-04-04T15:42:46,9
"Nah.  That's stupid.  Let's not do that.  He didn't ""know he raped someone so ran to the right"".  He's still convinced he's innocent and those women changed their minds or were ""really asking for it"" or whatever the fuck his stupid rapist mind thinks.  The reason he went to the right is because he's a piece of shit and an idiot and a conspiracy theorists who wants to feel smart.",UpperApe,2025-04-04T13:06:18,17

"Finally. The question I have is why didn’t this happen before the election when this guy was talking to millions of people with his bullshit born again nonsense saying Donald Trump was gonna save the world.   Best thing about this, other than it’s long over due is that it’s not in America and he can’t get a pardon from Trump. Hope he ends up in cell block one. He’s a literal monster.",TheGR8Dantini,2025-04-04T18:28:42,3

"These are old charges from the late 90s - early 2000s. He’s never hidden the fact that he is a recovered drug addict and sex addict. Did he get forceful with sexual partners in the past or improperly touch people? Quite possible. Sounds like something a drug and sex addict would likely do. Especially while under the influence.   But as far as the right wing stuff, he just got red pilled by social media like everyone else. His born again Christianity saga probably didn’t help things either, since all these evangelical churches are the furthest thing from being Christian these days. There are preaches now that don’t even preach about turning the other cheek because their congregations fundamentally disagree with the word of Christ.",Nas_Durden,2025-04-05T04:21:59,3
