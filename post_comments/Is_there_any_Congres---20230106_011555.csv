"There is no rule against the formation of a coalition government, and it wouldn't even be the first time in the US House, it just hasnt happened since before the civil war",ThatBioGuy,2023-01-06T09:53:58,13
"There is no rule preventing it. However, given the political incentives, I think finding the 6 willing Republicans would be near impossible.  Even ""reasonable"" Republicans would eventually have to face Republican primary voters next year and those voters would probably look unkindly on them working with Democrats to elect a Speaker.",federalist66,2023-01-06T10:28:37,9
"No. There is no rule preventing that.   FYI House Rules aren't law. They are just rules and procedures for operating the House.  There is no incentive for the Democrats to help the Republicans. The Republicans cannot be trusted and the best thing politically for them to do sit and vote in lockstep with each other.  However, if this goes on too long the Dems and Republicans will have to hammer out a power sharing agreement.",[deleted],2023-01-06T09:39:13,18
I'm pretty sure Nancy Pelosi would not have been house speaker if that were possible.,[deleted],2023-01-06T09:16:41,1
"Absolutely no rule against it, but it's a basically super unreasonable expectation because that's not how political behavior works. It just doesn't make any sense as a real solution. It could happen, but people would have to behave irrationally.",mormagils,2023-01-06T10:03:16,1
"It would for the good of the US as a whole and would disarm those right wing nutjobs.  The would make Gaetz, Boebert, Gosor, etc feel insignificant.  The new speaker can sentence them to the most trivial, insignificant of committees.",TexasYankee212,2023-01-06T15:46:24,1
"It's all about lockstep more than anything else. There's nothing that says ""if you're a Democrat then you have to vote for a Democrat candidate."" You can vote for anyone you want regardless of office - Gaetz threw in a vote for Donald Trump a day or two ago.",SmokeGSU,2023-01-06T09:30:10,1
"Well, there really isn't any rule preventing the Democrats from doing that. But keep in mind most of the House Republican Conference supports Kevin McCarthy. As for the ones that don't, they don't think that he's conservative enough. Because of that the only Republicans that don't support McCarthy are the ones least likely to work with the Democrats.",PaleontologistOk7794,2023-01-06T22:03:52,1
"Not ot mention, they'd be destroyed in right-wing media. Their political careers would be over.",Kevin-W,2023-01-07T22:26:09,3
"""Near impossible"" sounds about right. But parties have gone through major realignments before. This would be an interesting catalyst.",carpiediem,2023-01-06T11:14:01,1
Thanks- good to have some insight.  I recognize that the house rules aren't law. But they also aren't changeable until a speaker is elected.,carpiediem,2023-01-06T09:51:37,2
No Nancy was just actually capable of keeping her Caucus together lmao,RexTheElder,2023-01-06T10:51:09,10
Most of the House Republicans want a Speaker to be elected. Just because they've voted for him 12 times doesn't mean he's their first choice (or that they're not willing to look elsewhere after enough failures). I'm not suggesting that Lauren Robert might vote with the Democrats for a centrist.,carpiediem,2023-01-06T23:15:14,1
"No they can change them, if they want. In the past when there was no agreement on the Speakership they changed the rules to say a plurality of vote instead of a majority. The reason why that doesnt happen now is because if the Republicans agreed did that Jeffries the Democratic candidate for Speaker would win.",[deleted],2023-01-06T09:54:20,8
Actually. Her limitless campaign funding connections kept her in that seat.,[deleted],2023-01-06T12:45:47,-7
Huh; I didn't realize that. Thanks.,carpiediem,2023-01-06T11:11:46,1
"Yeah, so she was capable of keeping her Caucus together lmao.",RexTheElder,2023-01-06T14:48:47,8
"Good at wasting tax payer money on useless impeachment charges, Good at making sure capitol police is short staffed when many threats are present, and excellent at assisting a divided nation become even further divided! As for her caucus. It is the most dense part of the swamp that so desperately needs draining!",[deleted],2023-01-06T16:02:44,-6
"Yes, thankfully the House has upgraded to *checks notes* useless speaker votes. Swamp will be empty any day nowâ€¦..",super_dog17,2023-01-06T21:36:43,6
