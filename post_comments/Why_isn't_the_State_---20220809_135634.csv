"To clarify, are you asking why more states don't choose their presidential electors *through their legislatures*?",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-08-09T22:03:57,19

"Do you mean how state legislatures select the electors, or controlling how each elector votes?",ConstantGradStudent,2022-08-09T23:30:18,5
"You may be getting confused by the Independent Legislature doctrine, which is about re-districting.  When legislatures 'choose' electors, they do so via the normal process of lawmaking. All of the states have chosen a process whereby the electors are awarded based on a popular vote (although some allow for the splitting of electors). They could just as easily pass a law saying electors are chosen by a high stakes game of beer pong if they liked.  However, it's unlikely that the high-stakes-game-of-beer-pong method for choosing electors would be popular with the public. For virtually any political system you'll find a considerable amount of inertia because the public tends to think what they're accustomed to is what is best.  In terms of the National Popular Vote, the legal question isn't whether legislatures can use it as a method of selecting electors - they clearly can, just as they can use beer pong - but whether the compact itself is illegal since it is a device whereby some subset of states form an agreement to disadvantage others.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-10T04:24:17,9
"\> If both Republicans & Democrats support the states's right to pick the group of electors that the parties elected however they want for the POTUS election and it's a constitutional right of the states, why hasn't it been used yet?  Um....I don't think this is right. Actually, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say but if I'm reading the implication correctly, it's certainly not right. States do not have the right to do whatever they want when it comes to electors. That's simply not true.  Rather, the position of elector is a position appointed by a specific process just like any other political role. It's true that most states DO allow their electors to theoretically reject the outcome chosen by voters, but many states have taken away that ability. This is because even those that do protect that right admit that rejecting the voters should only be done in the most desperate of circumstances. The whole point of having a democracy is that we value the concept and results of voting.  So it's not really right that states can just do whatever they want. I'm not 100% sure on the process to become an elector, mostly because it's a super technical thing that's not really that important, but I believe the possible electors for each party are submitted ahead of the election by both parties, and whichever party wins the primary would then have their electors duly appointed by the legislature to serve for that election cycle. The point is, there is a specific process here, and that specific process is designed to boost legitimacy of our elections by respecting the process and its outcome. States doing ""whatever they want"" with electors after the election is a direct violation of this concept.  \> Republicans support it because of Trump, who wanted the states' electors to just pick him on January 6'th.  Yes, Republicans did support the idea that electors are whoever you want them to be, and even if you lose an election the state can just appoint electors who will vote differently and its equally legitimate in theory and practice. This is a LIE. That is not how electors work.   \> Democrats support it because of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact  This is where I'm not following. The states always have the right to pass laws binding their electors to the popular vote. The NPVIC sounds fancy and cool, but really it's just math. If states with a majority of electoral votes all bind their electors to the popular vote, then by definition the popular vote would determine who wins. Plain and simple. This isn't Dems ""supporting"" anything different or unusual about electors. In fact, it has little to do with electors at all. It's just advocating for what appears to be a pretty reasonable reform that if enough states sign off on will render the dissenters irrelevant because once a majority of EVs support the popular vote, it doesn't matter what anyone else does.",mormagils,2022-08-10T09:24:37,3
"Democrats only support it if the popular vote coincides with the party that electors represent.  Republicans support it so that they can choose Republican electors, regardless of the results of the election.  I understand the idea that a state should have control of how it's elections are run.  But, if a state could just pick any electors, regardless of what people vote for, then you risk falling into a zone that invalidates the entire democratic process.  People would no longer have a way to choose who gets elected and who doesn't. Eventually even the people they vote for to represent them would really just represent themselves.",etherend,2022-08-10T10:07:51,3
"There is 0 chance of that pact being implemented without being ruled unconstitutional. It's a fundraising vehicle nothing more.    It violates the Compact Clause of Article I that requires Congressional consent to enter in to such a pact which isn't going to happen.  But even if it did it would still violate the Compact Clause because in United States Steel Corporation v. Multistate Tax Commission SCOTUS ruled that the only permissible compact is one where ""each State would retain complete freedom to adopt or reject the rules and regulations of the Commission leaving each State free to withdraw at any time.” and that compact explicitly doesn't allow withdrawal at will.  It violates the Presidential Elections Clause of Article II which in turn makes it violate Article V requiring Constitutional Amendments to change the structure and function of the federalist system because the compact alters the function of the system created by the Presidential Elections Clause.  Literally the only way a national popular vote will ever be a thing is using Article V power to amend the Presidential Elections Clause and that's not happening.  The United STATES has 0 national elections. All elections are State elections, even for federal office. We are 50 States, United for the purposes of defense in International affairs.",DMFC593,2022-08-10T06:57:27,1

"It's true that the Republican-controlled high court halted the 2000 recount to preserve a Republican win, but the Florida recount by the rules of the time [probably would have resulted in Bush winning anyway](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/sns-ballots-story.html), even if more voters intended to vote for Gore.

">The United STATES has 0 national elections. All elections are State elections, even for federal office. We are 50 States, United for the purposes of defense in International affairs.

"Gore won more votes. More revisionist history of ""well if we counted them the way republicans allowed he'd still have lost.""  If it is a fact that more voters voted for Gore, it's a fact that Bush lost. It's been shown that in any fair amd full recount of the state Gore won. Full stop. No exceptions, no but um akshully.

I think you should clarify what you are asking then. All states already choose the manner in which electors are selected. You did not specifically ask a deeper question such as “Why don’t legislatures just create a slate of electors like they used to do after the founding of the Union?”,ConstantGradStudent,2022-08-10T09:47:57,6
"The Constitution requires Congressional approval of any interstate compacts: [Compact clause](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C3-3-1/ALDE_00001106/)  Personally, I don't think that NPVIC really puts other states at a disadvantage (indeed, it really removes state lines from the Presidential equation), but that is something Congress should at least be thinking about when deciding to approve a Compact like this.",roy_mustang76,2022-08-10T05:40:19,12

> The Constitution requires Congressional approval of any interstate compacts: Compact clause  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Compact Clause only applies to interstate compacts that usurp federal power. The NPVIC doesn't fall under that classification because the federal government has no role in choosing how states select their electors. The Compact Clause does not require the NPVIC to get Congressional approval.,matthoback,2022-08-12T18:43:09,1

"Applies to interstate compacts that usurp federal power OR that of non-compacting states, at least as far as I understand it. If NPVIC were to ever hit 270 EVs, and Texas isn't among the signatory states, they'd immediately challenge it on the basis that their state's electors no longer matter (thus usurping the power of Texan voters to determine the President). The rebuttal is, of course, that Texans are part of the popular vote, but I'm not willing to put money on that argument carry the day in front of the current Court.  At least as far as I can tell, the constitutionality of NPVIC without Congressional approval is not ironclad, and it would likely depend on the composition of the Court at the time that Texas's inevitable challenge arrived. If you have the votes, Congressional approval is a much better option, and may end up compelled by a Supreme Court ruling.",roy_mustang76,2022-08-12T20:46:22,1

"> Applies to interstate compacts that usurp federal power OR that of non-compacting states, at least as far as I understand it.  There's no way for an interstate compact to usurp power from non-compacting states. An interstate compact can only bind the compacting states to do what they already had the power to do. The only way interstate compacts can usurp federal power is by regulating state-to-state interactions, which is usually the jurisdiction of the federal government.  > If NPVIC were to ever hit 270 EVs, and Texas isn't among the signatory states, they'd immediately challenge it on the basis that their state's electors no longer matter (thus usurping the power of Texan voters to determine the President). The rebuttal is, of course, that Texans are part of the popular vote, but I'm not willing to put money on that argument carry the day in front of the current Court.  No, the rebuttal is that Texas's electoral votes still matter exactly as much as they did before the compact. To say that votes don't matter just because they might be on the losing side of an election is absurd. Their electoral votes would still be counted exactly the same as the electoral votes of any of the states in the compact. To argue that Texas would have a cause of action there would be as insane as arguing that Texas had a cause of action in 2020 against any state that voted for Biden because the totality of the electoral votes of those states made Texas's votes ""not matter"".  > At least as far as I can tell, the constitutionality of NPVIC without Congressional approval is not ironclad, and it would likely depend on the composition of the Court at the time that Texas's inevitable challenge arrived.  It's not ironclad in the sense that the current SCOTUS is not governed by anything but bare naked partisanship, certainly not precedent or the Constitution or even the reality of facts. But the precedent is very clear and if it comes down to that, the states should just ignore any SCOTUS ruling to the contrary.  > If you have the votes, Congressional approval is a much better option, and may end up compelled by a Supreme Court ruling.  I don't see there being the votes in the Senate to pass Congressional approval of the NPVIC past a filibuster any time soon.",matthoback,2022-08-12T21:00:58,1
