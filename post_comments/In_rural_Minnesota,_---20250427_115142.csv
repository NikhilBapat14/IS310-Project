"Odd title, since ""the pain"" these people anticipate being ""worth it"" isn't going to resemble anything they've seen before -- at least not if they're under the age of 70.  What will they say if we get twenty years of high unemployment combined with high inflation, followed by -- if we're lucky -- a return to a world in which the USA is understood to be the natural first among free nations?  The idea that buying goods cheaply from other countries = being ripped off is so stupid on its face that it's hard not to laugh at people who smugly assert that this imbalance must be fixed at all costs!  I know people like this; I'm related to them. They will never, ever understand what's happening or what role they're playing in their own degradation.",sleepingbeardune,2025-04-27T14:57:23,5
"They wonder why some people kind of wish they’d go through painful things in life: Because we want them to know that postponing building a house is not one of them! And because it’s only when they are affected by something that they grasp that others have been terribly, painfully affected for a long time (see Rob Portman’s son coming out). I don’t Understand why they think the trade deficits are the cause of the demise of family farms — that started decades ago with corporate farm companies buying them out for more than their neighbor’s kid could offer.",Ella0508,2025-04-27T12:03:38,8

The global market and technological advancements that right-wing farmers disdain are the only reasons why they are able to collectively sell more agricultural products than Americans can consume.  Right-wing farmers are killing their family farms because they are mired in stupid talking points about the global market that is made possible by technological advancements and apparent inability to do basic consumerism math.,ResidentKelpien,2025-04-27T13:27:02,4
"“If we try to fix it little by little, it never changes,” said Lucas Boyd, a truck driver and school board member from nearby Royalton. “You pull off the Band-Aid, it’s going to bleed. And eventually it’s going to heal.”  >From 1960 until 1980, Democrats won Morrison County in six presidential election cycles in a row. After two decades as a swing county, Morrison County has gone Republican in every presidential election since 2000. Republican margins have increased each cycle, with Trump winning 77% in 2024.  >Trump’s agenda, Schultz said, resonates with the everyman here. Local people aren’t wealthy: Morrison County ranks in the bottom fifth in the state for median household income. It’s virtually all white — 97%, according to U.S. census numbers — and more than 1 in 5 residents over age 65, slightly higher than the state average. School enrollment has declined.  >Trump’s policies are seen as helping Main Street, family farms and the once-thriving manufacturing base. Those changes matter way more than the stock market, Schultz said.  >“Our heyday was when you had a different family farm on every corner,” Schultz said. “Trump is the first president in at least four decades who is addressing these trade deficits in a meaningful way and saying, ‘This is the purpose of my administration.’”  So, they keep electing Republicans while their town continues to literally die and they blame everyone but themselves?

"What a depressing read.  I wish the reporter has asked much more probing questions -  what policies, specifically, did they dislike from the Biden administration.  Which specific policies of Trump do they like?    Everything is just generalities, and from the reporting it is hard not to draw the conclusion that a lot of these people are simply racist and economically illiterate.
