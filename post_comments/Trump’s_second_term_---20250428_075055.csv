"How about we just impeach him and remove him as quickly as possible? We only need like 20 people to make that happen. Why is nobody willing to talk about this? The circle of people that want Democrats to fight is almost entirely within the circle of people that are afraid to even hope for an effective end to this corrupt incompetence.   You have to envision a possible future before you make it a reality. You have to believe it's possible. But we're still at the point where nobody is even willing to say that impeachment and removal is what they want, what they think would be good, what should happen. Safer to say it's not going to happen. Feels cooler. Right now the cowardice in congress is exceeded by the cowardice in the comments. I understand that it's unlikely, that it's a long shot, but you can't say you're fighting if you're not even willing to hope for a better future. Let's stop trying to envision exactly how bad it will be and start trying to change the trajectory. The first step to getting him impeached is getting clear public support for impeachment. That means you.    P. S. Don't bother telling me that Vance would be worse. You'll just embarrass yourself. If Vance were elected with the kind of support Trump had then maybe he would be worse. But Vance sitting in the Oval after congress turned on Trump and removed him from office would not be able to do nearly as much damage as Trump is doing now. Impeachment and removal is the path.",NicPizzaLatte,2025-04-28T08:51:29,19

Here is what I’m concerned about the most.  Imagine if Trump had an actual economic plan that works?  This is the most racist and phobic administration in my lifetime (I’m 34). The opinions that have become mainstream are absolutely horrific. It’s true that these viewpoints have existed all along but for all the years I’ve been alive they have never been given center stage.  I fear this may never change. People are willing to allow a president ignore the constitution to do absolutely horrible things to other humans so long as the economy is in good shape. That’s where we are as a nation at this moment in history. It’s quite sad.,hmr0987,2025-04-28T11:14:10,4

"I understand your position, but respectfully disagree. Trump is a party unto himself.   Have there been evil forces trying to break through into mainstream culture? Sure. Are they some dark hidden masterminds? No. They are morons too. Look at Musk. Three years or so ago, people were hailing him as the savior of the human race. A staggering intellect and true renisance man. What have the last few years taught us? He’s a moron who bought Twitter by mistake (remember he tried to get out of it, and only gave in when he was told he didn’t have an easy way out). Then he lucked into figuring out he could use Twitter to get into Trump. Then he ran wild like the shit gibbon he is.   The geniuses who could actually have planned all of this didn’t. They just got sort of lucky with their candidate. A canidiate who came back from impeachment, instigating a mob to elminate Congress, and getting as close as you can get to being convicted for rape without actually getting convicted. Is there any president you can think of who could have pullled that off? He has a large base (30-40% of the electorate) who would not bat an eye if he gave a press conference wearing only a basketball jersey during which he announced that he would be taking a second wife.. and that wife was an underage cow. Hell many of them would go out the next day to get cow tattoos on their foreheads. That’s his strength. Cult leader strength. But the thing about cult leader strength is that it doesn’t always transfer when the leader dies especially if the leader never invested any effort into their line of succession (and Trump has no interest in that).   I agree there are bad hombres out there but suggesting that they are geniuses who have been playing the long game for the past 70 years gives them the impression of invulnerability. In 2000 the bad guys were all neocons and I promise you that people back then talked about how the neocons had been planning this forever. The party machine that “constrained” Tterm1 were all suposed to be master planners who had set this up all along. And to give evil credit where it’s do, they managed to steal a Supreme Court seat. But even Mitch McConnell has been washed away by Trump. If you want proof that Trump isn’t being puppeteered by some invisible villains, look at his shitty handling tariffs.
