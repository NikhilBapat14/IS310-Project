"The Dollar has tanked since 1/20/25.  Spewing lies & threats has done critical damage to economic sentiment with regard to the USA.

"It’s only “Trump’s economy” if it’s doing better. For example, the economy was improving by the end of Obama’s 8 years, so Trump says the economy during his term of 2016-2020 was improving, therefore taking credit for what Obama did. But now that he’s taken Biden’s economy (that wasn’t doing all that well), he can’t help but blame it on Biden’s term while ignoring the fact he’s the one actively making it worse and worse",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-05T07:34:12,1
"I'm not American, but I read recently that Trump is claiming that retail petrol/gas is $1.90/gallon. Looked it up. The AAA says the national average price is $3.18. Still, the average is a lot lower than a year ago ($3.67). All hail Pontiff/King Trump I guess /s",Soggy_Employer9171,2025-05-05T07:32:38,1
"By Hugh Cameron — U.S. News Reporter |  Americans have given their view on whether President Donald Trump inherited a weakened economy from his predecessor, or if the current difficulties are the result of his own policies.  According to a new poll by Gallup, nearly half Americans (46 percent) view Trump as more responsible for the current state of the economy, compared to 27 percent who chose Joe Biden. One-in-five (21 percent) said that responsibility was equally shared between both the former and current president, while five percent blamed neither.

"John Oliver put it best when the public was surveyed and something like 2/5 people didn't believe in X.  His response was basically: ""that's fine, but the headline may as well have been '2 in 5 Americans are wrong about stuff'.

It’s not even neutrality. Asking your audience loaded questions after you’ve presented them with a biased viewpoint is just stoking the flames of outrage.   I actually think the fairness doctrine needs to be reimplemented and adapted to include websites and social media platforms.   Force these content creators and social media sites to actually present opposing views so that viewers are actually getting a more complete analysis of an issue rather than reinforcing biases that these companies help to instill in their viewer base.,alien88,2025-05-05T09:47:36,1

"> But now that he’s taken Biden’s economy (that wasn’t doing all that well)  Biden's economy was actually doing the best of any nation on Earth.  Despite people trying to will a Recession into being for years after COVID, Biden and Powell did the seemingly impossible with their ""soft landing"". And we ended up with a US economy, best on Earth post-COVID.  Trump immediately threw that in the trash.",CrashB111,2025-05-05T08:04:23,6

Trump is a moron and Elon cheated to get him in office now Elon is crying like a baby because everyone hates him. Wouldn’t have been close at all if huge swaths of American men did not want a female president. I’m so ashamed of my country,happyretiredmom,2025-05-05T08:53:45,1

"I don’t mean to diminish how Biden recovered the economy since Covid, he improved it significantly but it was still not the ideal or the expected from the richest nation in the world. Still, I think we can agree that Trump is maliciously lying when he says “the good parts of the current economy are mine and the bad ones are Biden’s”. Not only is he lying, I also can’t seem to put my finger on the good parts he describes…",Gl0ryfl3x,2025-05-05T08:09:10,1
So apparently someone on another thread says that is about the price of gas before it goes to the gas companies who then add the additives and fillers and send out to stations. So it’s like claiming bread is only 2 dollars by looking at the cost of wheat or flour.,STUPIDNEWCOMMENTS,2025-05-05T08:53:25,1
