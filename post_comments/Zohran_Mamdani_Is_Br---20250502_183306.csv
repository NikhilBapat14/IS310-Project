"*Sitting in a bus shelter, he explains that two-thirds of New Yorkers support his plan for city-owned grocery stores, while three-fourths support making buses free...   In front of a city park blooming with daffodils, he reports that 80 percent of New Yorkers support his plan to freeze the rent.*  If he doesn't beat Cuomo in the June primary, I'll bet he will take him down next time.
