Any democratic member of the house can also call for a vote to vacate. It's not up to just republicans.   Not sure if they will though. I would like them to use this card when the republicons try and do stupid stuff.,afedelejr,2023-01-11T06:20:11,12
"There's not a rule against it, but it wouldn't work. It's not that simply being a certain party affiliation gives you special powers in Congress. It's that the House is governed by a majority rules system, and so as long as Kevin McCarthy can command 218 votes pretty much whenever he needs to, he can run the show. A Dem that's already outside that 218 switching to Rep wouldn't actually do anything further to take away that 218.  The reason the Rep defections at the start were such a big deal wasn't because they as Reps had a special ability to oppose McCarthy. It was because 20 defections meant that McCarthy didn't have 218 votes. Lacking a majority in the chamber basically means you can't govern, and that's what happened.",mormagils,2023-01-11T09:21:50,3
"As I understand it, yes.  But they won't.  They want the GOP to do stupid stuff and won't want to interfere with the GOP doing stupid stuff.  The Dems are counting on the GOP to be so stupid over the next year and a half that the Dems win in 2024.",phreeeman,2023-01-12T11:43:59,2
"It would be better for Democrats to let Republicans pass their mostly unpopular agenda (federal abortion restrictions, tax cuts for the rich, etc.) since those bills won't make it out of the Senate. That way, Dems can point to the bills on the campaign trail and say, ""look what they already tried to do.""",loselyconscious,2023-01-12T23:32:26,2
"It would be 10/10 fitting in the kabuki that is our house, senate, executive branch, scotus and would change absolutely nothing in the bipartisan lockstep march in service of the wealthy/corporate/billionaire class",humanitariangenocide,2023-01-11T09:17:17,0
"Democrats, if they REALLY wanted to, could cause so much mischief with this new rule since there is such a slim majority.  If there are 5 or six absent/out of town Republicans in the house and all the Dems are there, get recognized and make a motion to vacate. Since it is a privileged motion, everything stops and vote has to take place. Also, Republicans got rid of proxy voting so each member has to be there physically  If the vote to vacate passes. Then the House has to stop all work until a new Speaker is elected.",westparkguy,2023-01-11T06:55:31,8
"I just figured if dems could call for the vote, it at least works to delay bills getting through. They likely won't pass senate anyways, but if it happens when a few republicans are fed up with mccarthy it might throw us back to being speakerless is all. But I didn't realize they didn't need to be republicans to call for the motion to vacate",[deleted],2023-01-11T11:38:26,3
"> Then the House has to stop all work until a new Speaker is elected.  It doesn't have to stop all work - merely legislative procedure. Most of the work of the House is conducted in committees that would simply continue.  Moreover, this sort of pseudo-filibuster makes no sense for Democrats because they control the Senate and the Presidency. If the Democrats try such a scheme, the Republicans would just respond by doing it themselves - and the Democrats are the ones who want the House operating, not the Republicans since the Republicans can't pass legislation anyway.",ViskerRatio,2023-01-11T21:25:12,3
Couldnâ€™t they elect a new Speaker right then and there? I think it only requires a quorum which would be 218 members present.,yer_deterred,2023-01-11T08:03:15,3
Right. This wouldn't work because the Reps can basically just vote it down because they control a majority of votes.,mormagils,2023-01-11T11:49:31,3
The less members there the less votes it takes to become speaker,[deleted],2023-01-11T08:05:20,3
