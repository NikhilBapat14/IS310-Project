"I dont think people are naturally homophobic. I am sure that this, along with many other forms of bigotry, is learned behaviour probably rooted in religion and the pervasive impact it has had on various cultures over history.  There are plenty of examples of pre-Christian and pre-Islamic societies where homosexuality was perfectly acceptable.",prustage,2025-03-16T23:09:28,39
"Gay and trans acceptance, as in not being thrown in jail?  That came about in the 70s really.  Before that homosexuals faced prison and trans people faced nebulous charges.  The 70s were horrific and it wasn't really till the 2010s that we can say people became even a bit tolerent.  Anyway I love you say outside of the West.  Do note nations like Japan have been getting more tolerant and that some nations in Asia have gotten a bit better.  That said it seems to mostly a push back from Christian and Muslim fundies that is causing any backslide.     Why the hate against gays and trans people?  Paranoia and ignorance.  We shouldn't let those win.  We must carry the light of progress forever forward and not accept a return to darkness.  Human rights for all people must be upheld and advance now and always.",Birdonthewind3,2025-03-16T23:27:31,19
"I believe it is much more likely that the process is cultural rather than ""natural"".  > This is more of a philosophical issue, but as it relates to politics, do you think it's impossible for ""the left"" to win, in any country going forward, without openly signaling that they will no longer support basic gay rights and acceptance?  It depends on how effective the anti-LGBT propaganda is. The US situation seems mainly to be the result of a very effective propaganda campaign, but that's less likely to be effective in countries with a more sane political systems.  For example Trump's success in the election wrt this particular issue seems to be that they managed to paint the democrats as some kind of pro trans extremists. If this works it is very effective, because it is basically impossible to defend against.  I mean it's pretty clear that the democrats are not actually pro trans extremists, so if you're accused of being that, how do you deal with it? You can't really backtrack, because there's nothing to backtrack from! In fact this kind of propaganda skews the politics in favour of the attacker, because the only thing that D could do to deal with this would be to loudly reject trans rights, and that in itself does not necessarily have popular support. Another option is to spam counter propaganda, but how would that look? ""We're really not pro-trans extremists!"" is less effective than ""Those guys want to forcibly transition children!""",theKGS,2025-03-16T22:54:23,10
"The thing is, people *aren't* naturally homophobic. In fact, historically, people for the vast majority of time have been completely fine with trans, gay, and queer people. This new strain of homophobia is pretty new, all things considered.  It would be a mistake to abandon the basic principles of openness that the left represents even if it did promise greater electoral success. That's not a trade worth making.",HeloRising,2025-03-17T01:29:46,4
"I think the real issue is building cultural norms and institutions where people simply respect differences.   Education is the best way to achieve this and Republicans are smart to recognize it as a potential obstacle to their ideology. If students of all ages learned and were exposed to more people from the LGBTQ+ community it could cut through discrimination.  Saying that an issue can't be won due to engrained prejudice is not smart or accurate. The Civil Rights Movement has had multiple iterations along with leaders. 1880s had the emergency of Frederick Douglas, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Dubois. This is in spite of the enactment of black codes in the South, the following Plessy V Ferguson (1896). The resegregation of the federal workforce by Wilson was a massive obstacle. It still led to the emergence of Thurgood Marshall, Marcus Garvey, MLK, and Malcolm X. So saying prejudice is too strong or engrained isn't a way to proceed. It's a method of giving up. You gotta fight and protest for the changes you want.",DLO_Buckets,2025-03-16T23:10:53,3

"Talking about the US, we went from majority of people disapproving of gay marriage in the early 2000s, to the majority approving it, (I believe it happened during Obama's second presidency?)   I think it's a culture and I think it's slipping a little, but won't slip back as far as it was. The current vitriol is mostly against trans people, which sucks for sure. But it's a minority of a miniority. It...will get better for them. It'll just take time, I think.",Xanto97,2025-03-16T23:32:24,1
I think human society defaults to Imperium of Man-style xenophobia on just about everything but that doesn't mean we can't or shouldn't fight that instinct with education and mobilization of liberal institutions against bigotry.,Potato_Pristine,2025-03-18T09:23:28,1
"Using the argument that we can define what is ""natural"" by what the majority culture believes, implies that it is natural for women to always exist in a subservient state because they exist in the subservient state in virtually every culture on earth.   In other words you're saying that homophobia is natural based on the fact that the majority of the world's cultures are homophobic. Using that argument since the majority of the world's cultures or misogynistic, i.e., they put women in the secondary position with more limited political and economic power then, that, too must be natural.  So why bother to struggle to give women equal rights?     Up until the early 18th century there were virtually no popular democracies anywhere in the world.  So popular democracy must be unnatural so we shouldn't strive to achieve it.     ",Independent-Roof-774,2025-03-18T18:23:19,1
"I think it depends on what you mean by acceptance.  I live in a conservative area and when Obgerfell happened, most folks seemed actually relieved since the debate has been settled and maybe now the LGBT movement would finally shut up about gay rights.  The reason they seem to be backpedaling is that they think the LGBT has gone too far, especially with trans. The attitude is ""You wanted tolerance, you got it. What more do you want from us?""",Key_Day_7932,2025-03-26T13:01:25,1

As a straight male, when some see two males publicly making out with each other, they put themselves into one of their shoes and wouldn’t find that pleasant.

"Yea, I wouldn't say I believe this 100% but it would follow like you said. Maybe all of this is just basic human nature. Maybe even wanting to have an authoritarian government is natural.

"You're right that some people viscerally hate novelty, difference and anything they're unfamiliar with.  But note that these cognitively inflexible people also historically hated miscegenation, red haired people, left-handers, blacks, menstruation and women in trousers. All these entirely natural things were deemed by them to be unnatural. And this prejudice - while it likely has a neurological basis - only lingers because it is culturally enforced.  For example, in the UK, when Margret Thatcher's school legislation which forbid the mentioning of homosexuality was overturned, schools saw a sharp decrease in anti-gay bullying. By simply briefly explaining things to kids, their prejudices sharply declined.",Wetness_Pensive,2025-03-18T18:25:59,2
">you couldn’t just say “I’m gay” and marry the same sex  You also couldn't just say ""I'm straight"" and marry the opposite sex.  Marriages were arranged by parents. More specifically, it was between the two fathers. An Athenian man couldn't marry a foreign woman at all, and the most common marriages were between cousins and/or uncles and nieces.  The current concept of heterosexuality is just as inapplicable to ancient cultures as the current concept of homosexuality.  People didn't go by ""hetero norms"", they went by societal norms.   Those norms including things we find repugnant, like the aforementioned cousin couplings or the accepted practice of pederasty.   As far as ancient marriages customs are concerned, we have first-hand sources noting that in Egypt ""A man would marry a man and a woman a woman, a man would marry a woman and her daughter, and a woman would be married to two men."" (Sifra).   And in Rome, gay weddings are recorded. Two Roman emperors had them, and in their courts their are sources noting men with their own husbands. And there is some evidence of other male-male weddings, with an expectation that the celebration of such acts would lead to their official registration.   Most of these sources are mocking these or warning populations against them, but they still show that it isn't as simple as saying ""things were different back then, and if they did do such things it was just for pleasure.""",ManBearScientist,2025-03-18T09:12:05,5
"> there has never been a historical society anywhere where the current conception of homosexuality was acceptable.  Why is gay marriage much further than what occurred in previous societies?

"Trans people can have kids.  It about if I remember 50-60%?  Actually the bigger issue would be gay people in theory as they have the lowest rate.  Though the birth rate factor only cares about replacing AFAB/people with wombs.  That cause lesbians are still reduced from hetrosexual women.    But honestly the whole thing is squeezing blood out of a stone.  For a government concerned about birth rates lazy answers is banning condoms, birth control, abortion outside medical reasons as they want the women to live and make more kids, and banning sterilization.  If a government actually cares they can fight it with things like free daycare and strong welfare for mothers.  No the fight against lgbt people is over paranoia and ignorance.

Palm Springs today has never been more vibrant since the days of Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. Many of them are conservative, because they are pro business. They are also very pro police.
