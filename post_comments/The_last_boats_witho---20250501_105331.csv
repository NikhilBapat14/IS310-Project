"I have a water filter at my house - Went to buy a replacement filter. Two months ago it was $250, now its $275, and has a $50 tariff surcharge, and TAXES on the extra tarriffs. Fuck Trump.",fizzlemynizzle7194,2025-05-01T11:32:27,21

Provided the imports continue. With 145% tariffs in place imports will no doubt shrink.,voyagerdoge,2025-05-01T12:52:03,2

"If Trump was smart enough to plan to bring manufacturing here, I'd feel less worried, but something tells me his puppet masters don't share big words and ideas with him.",PhSuns2024,2025-05-01T13:32:40,0

"Walmart and Target CEOs said between 4 and 6 weeks, because they have made some reserves in their warehouses. It all depends on if people start panic buying or not.",Same_Performance_595,2025-05-01T12:47:24,6

"They won't continue from China, not really. Last ship arrives May 10th on the East Coast (from China). EU and other places still here but tariffed.",bananastand512,2025-05-01T18:30:29,3
"Forget the orange turd. There is no ""bringing manufacturing here"". It's just not a thing anyone can do for the US. We don't make things. At best we put them together from parts sourced abroad.",NerdyMcNerderson,2025-05-01T13:51:30,5
"Yeah, where's the like 4 trillion dollars of investment that'd be needed to actually make the factories that would be needed here? And why wasn't construction material excluded from the tariffs? You know, to BRING the MANUFACTURERS here, he does know that they would need to actually BUILD the factories right?   He's not stupid enough to shoot himself in the foot on his own plan by NOT excluding building materials from tariffs, right?   It's almost like there was no plan, and he just liked the 'concept' of tariffs he's had in his mind for the last 30 years, but never once decided to examine it deeper. Like everything else.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-01T13:57:30,4

"I feel that with enough time and effort, the right administration could pressure companies to return jobs that were outsourced to the US. It would mean they abide by higher environmental and labor regulations most likely, but I'm sure with the right team, a leader could start the process. I concede that neither party has started this process, but Trump likes to say his Tarrifs will bring jobs back.",PhSuns2024,2025-05-01T13:54:17,-5
