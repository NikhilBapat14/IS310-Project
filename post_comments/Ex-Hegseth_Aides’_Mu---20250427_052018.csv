"A battle between aides in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth‚Äôs Pentagon didn‚Äôt end when the entangled parties were ousted from the Pentagon, according to a Saturday report in The Guardian.   In fact, the spat seems to have become even contentious, with one staffer reportedly making calls investigating whether another used cocaine at a previous job in an effort to turn up dirt for a lawsuit.   Colin Carroll was one of three high-ranking Hegseth aides‚Äîalong with Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick‚Äîwho were fired earlier this month amid an investigation into whether they had leaked information to the media. Colin Carroll was kicked out by the Biden administration from the Pentagon‚Äôs former Joint Artificial Intelligence Center for allegedly creating a hostile work environment.   Colin Carroll is researching a potential lawsuit against Joe Kasper.   The three have since jointly decried their removals as ‚Äúunconscionable‚Äù and hinted that leaks were not the real reason they got the boot.   Several reports have suggested that it was actually the aides‚Äô ‚Äúknife fight‚Äù power struggle with Hegseth‚Äôs chief of staff, Joe Kasper, that led to the trio‚Äôs dismissal. Kasper, who faced accusations of inappropriate workplace behavior, left the Pentagon as well this week. But the conflict is hardly over.   The Guardian reported that Carroll is considering filing a defamation suit against Kasper, and he has made calls to ask people close to Kasper about a tip that he used cocaine in a previous job.   Some of the calls reached Kasper‚Äôs former clients and his wife.   This has enraged Kasper. Reached by The Guardian for comment, he denied the claim, pointing to the Pentagon‚Äôs required drug testing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so egregiously stupid,‚Äù he said.",the25thday,2025-04-27T08:37:24,3

Users who suffer from cocaethylene exposure are high strung, highly narcissistic, and have lower intelligence due to the neurotoxin affects.

Cocaethylene is testable in hair follicles up to 90 days after use.  Anybody who can get a sample of Hegseth's mane can prove he is unfit to lead the military.",Discokruse,2025-04-27T21:35:06,2

"I'm fine with using more invasive tests. These are the politicians, bureaucrats, and public officials in charge of our country. I'd say anyone in the House, Senate, via executive appointment, or via Congressional appointment/hearing/vote should be subject to these tests.   Frankly, anyone with a clearance should already be subject to these tests when they're first cleared, at least on paper, but I have my doubts that these tests are either being enforced for leadership, or failed results are being overlooked. The real overhaul would be enforcing the ""*don't do drugs*"" requirements of these positions.",McFlyParadox,2025-04-27T11:10:02,1

We it's both. But generally unless it's military they aren't going to watch you piss in the cup so you just have to act normal enough that they don't suspect you and then to beat the cup you have to either have clean piss or fake piss and get it to the right temp for the thermometer on the cup but that's easy with a hand warmer.,burnsalot603,2025-04-27T09:45:24,1
It definitely gets enforced in the military.  I don't see why it can't be enforced with the beaureucrats. I had regular UAs to hold my security clearance.
