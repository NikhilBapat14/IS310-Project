"A battle between aides in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s Pentagon didn’t end when the entangled parties were ousted from the Pentagon, according to a Saturday report in The Guardian.   In fact, the spat seems to have become even contentious, with one staffer reportedly making calls investigating whether another used cocaine at a previous job in an effort to turn up dirt for a lawsuit.   Colin Carroll was one of three high-ranking Hegseth aides—along with Dan Caldwell and Darin Selnick—who were fired earlier this month amid an investigation into whether they had leaked information to the media. Colin Carroll was kicked out by the Biden administration from the Pentagon’s former Joint Artificial Intelligence Center for allegedly creating a hostile work environment.   Colin Carroll is researching a potential lawsuit against Joe Kasper.   The three have since jointly decried their removals as “unconscionable” and hinted that leaks were not the real reason they got the boot.   Several reports have suggested that it was actually the aides’ “knife fight” power struggle with Hegseth’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, that led to the trio’s dismissal. Kasper, who faced accusations of inappropriate workplace behavior, left the Pentagon as well this week. But the conflict is hardly over.   The Guardian reported that Carroll is considering filing a defamation suit against Kasper, and he has made calls to ask people close to Kasper about a tip that he used cocaine in a previous job.   Some of the calls reached Kasper’s former clients and his wife.   This has enraged Kasper. Reached by The Guardian for comment, he denied the claim, pointing to the Pentagon’s required drug testing. “It’s so egregiously stupid,” he said.",the25thday,2025-04-27T08:37:24,3

"The combination of alcohol and cocaine in the back of an addicts throat creates an acute neurotoxin, cocaethylene.  Users who suffer from cocaethylene exposure are high strung, highly narcissistic, and have lower intelligence due to the neurotoxin affects.  They often make poor decision and take on unnecessary risks in everyday life.  The presence of cocaethylene has four times the lasting presence in the body that simple cocaine.  Cocaethylene is testable in hair follicles up to 90 days after use.  Anybody who can get a sample of Hegseth's mane can prove he is unfit to lead the military.",Discokruse,2025-04-27T21:35:06,2

As another poster mentions it’s absolutely not the main thrust of the book. But it does have a good breakdown of the troubleshooting approach of understanding a whole system and the links between them and figuring out how to ask “isolating questions” to zero in on where a problem actually is.,Charlie_Mouse,2025-04-27T12:17:09,2

We it's both. But generally unless it's military they aren't going to watch you piss in the cup so you just have to act normal enough that they don't suspect you and then to beat the cup you have to either have clean piss or fake piss and get it to the right temp for the thermometer on the cup but that's easy with a hand warmer.,burnsalot603,2025-04-27T09:45:24,1
It definitely gets enforced in the military.  I don't see why it can't be enforced with the beaureucrats. I had regular UAs to hold my security clearance.  I've had a nearly monthly instance during my time in the army where I had someone watch me pee in a cup. 🤣,akagami_shanks_13492,2025-04-28T06:11:08,1
