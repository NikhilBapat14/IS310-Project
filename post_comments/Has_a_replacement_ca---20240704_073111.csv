"Yes, James Buchanan.  President Franklin Pierce failed to clear the 2/3 threshold of delegates in 1856, leading to a brokered Democratic Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio.  With the writing on the wall, Pierce withdrew from the convention and urged his supporters to back Sen. Stephen Douglas. This too was unsuccessful.  Douglas then withdrew, leading to James Buchanan, then the Minister to Great Britain, to become the Democratic Nominee. As a conciliatory effort a Pierce ally, Kentucky Congressman John C. Breckinridge, was nominated as Vice-President.  Buchanan opted not to run in 1860, and Breckinridge became the Democratic Nominee instead, subsequently losing to Abraham Lincoln.

"PhantomoftheDistrict is correct with the historical analysis.  Regarding the implied question of ""could Biden/should Biden drop"", as others have stated here, it would be a bad move according to all the knowledge we have had up to this point about the advantage incumbent presidents hold towards winning an election.  On the other hand, there might be an argument that this election might not follow all of the same ""rules"" that elections normally follow, both due to being in our age of fast information and due to the very unique circumstances surrounding both the president and the opponent. Biden is a mostly disliked candidate with a mostly disliked VP and has some genuine age concerns. Trump is an extremely polarizing candidate and a convicted felon trying to enact a combination of policies that are favored (his immigration policies are generally liked by the public) and extremely disliked (You know, the whole fascism and Christian nationalism things are not favored by most of the public.)   This is not an endorsement. I genuinely don't know and can't tell what is correct. But if there were any election in which the normal rules of politics don't apply, it might be this one, and I think it's worth discussing.  edit: better worded last part of middle paragraph and some grammar.",BiiVii,2024-07-04T10:03:24,12
Biden has a huge advantage because he is the incumbent and because he ran an uncontested primary. If the Democrats wanted to replace him they had their chance. Replacing him now with a panic candidate would almost certainly guarantee a Trump win.,SouthOfOz,2024-07-04T09:02:02,25
"As I count it, there are six instances where the sitting president decided not to seek a new term. In four of the six instances, the opposing party won.  James Polk: Democrats lose to the Whigs  James Buchanan: Democrats lose to the Republicans  Harry Truman: Democrats lose to Republicans  Lyndon Johnson: Democrats lose to Republicans  Rutherford B Hayes and Calvin Coolidge were both Republicans replaced by Republicans  ETA: PhantomOfTheDistrict points out that I forgot Franklin Pierce, which also did not result in a change of parties in power.",euphemiagold,2024-07-04T09:53:14,3

"If Biden were to be replaced after the convention, then maybe. But Biden is not the official nominee until the convention, so if the convention nominates someone else, then legally speaking they are not a ""replacement"", they're just the nominee.",Gurney_Hackman,2024-07-04T22:04:30,10
"Yes, if it's after the [state's ballot access deadline](https://www.nass.org/sites/default/files/surveys/2020-07/research-ballot-access-president-Jan20_0.pdf). All states have a deadline for when you need to submit the candidate to be on the ballot. For major parties, it's typically 40-90 days out from the election.  There are several states with ballot access deadlines in early August (90 days out from the election), which is obviously before the convention where the candidate is officially confirmed. Most of these are blue states, and they've been granted waivers to submit the candidate after the convention, which is normally standard practice for both parties. The problem with Ohio was that their Republican secretary of state and legislature decided they were going to play hardball and not allow the waiver this year. This would force Ohio Democrats to finalize the candidate on their ballot by early August. (This is one reason why the people angling for a brokered convention are bound to be disappointed--no matter what happens, the candidate will be finalized before we get to the convention.)  No state's ballot access deadline has passed yet, so right now it's still possible to replace the candidate pretty easily. But once August hits, those deadlines will start coming up quickly, and the Democrats will not be able to change their candidate after they pass.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-05T11:08:50,1
"Thank you for the shoutout.  My only thing to add here is to agree with your sentiment that traditional political norms may not apply to this election.  I've been thinking about this since the debate, and it may be too radical even for me, but it keeps popping up in my thoughts:  How did Donald Trump win in 2016? He threw out the playbook and gave the American People something new, something fresh. He energized a base long subdued in favor of an establishment unwilling to change.  If Democrats want to win in 2024, maybe they need to throw out the playbook.",[deleted],2024-07-04T10:09:54,12
"Also people don't seem remember the freakout after Obama's first Romney debate.  Or after Hillary's cold.  Certain left leaning columnists were discussing replacing them too.  Also, after Trump's ""Grab Women by the Pussy"" tape, the RNC briefly went looking for a replacement too.  The media loves freaking out, great for ratings.  PS: yes Biden had a bad debate, and normally I'd say a bad day doesn't disqualify someone from their job ... but having it on nationally broadcast television doesn't help ... sigh.",chicagobob,2024-07-05T01:12:02,2
The incumbency advantage is irrelevant because Trump was already president. We see this in the polling.,ncolaros,2024-07-04T09:10:00,30
"I thoroughly disagree.  For months, we have been seeing polling of as much as 1/4 of the broader electorate choosing “neither of these candidates” in head-to-head matchups between Biden and Trump.  The phenomenon of “double hate” could work to the Dem advantage if they break that cycle and give them someone else. Someone popular in critical states.

"The thing is globally, the incumbency advantage seems to be waning. In India, the PM won but by an incredibly smaller margin that he did the last time. The UK and France are both about to toss their incumbent parties out of power as well.

"Yes, it actually works backwards because people are always unhappy so 4 years ago seems like it was better even if it was objectively a disaster by every possible measure.

"Interesting insights in your comment. Agreed on most points.  I do however question if People's understanding of the current economy is based on their refusal to acknowledge that the economy is getting better.  Is the economy working? Sure, but for whom?   With skyrocketing prices on nearly everything but Arizona Iced Tea and the Costco hot dog, coupled with a rapidly disappearing middle class, I do not believe we should criticize the working person for feeling the weight of this economy on their backs when they are not seeing the rewards of it.  The President can absolutely be doing better on the economy.",[deleted],2024-07-04T09:55:07,1
"Put more plainly then, the incumbency advantage is not enough for Biden to overcome Trump right now. In an election where a good percentage of the population is angry that these are our choices, you could make a strong case that another candidate has an advantage over either of the two current candidates just by being someone else.

"1968 is not a reasonable comparison—it was a very different situation. The incumbent took a drubbing in the early primaries and dropped out. The winner of the primaries (who would have gone on to win the general election) was assassinated. The resulting candidate was the incumbent Vice, whom no one loved.  So if a brokered convention this year was just cover for subbing in Kamala, your comparison would resonate. But if Biden released all the delegates (who are all pledged to him, and a half-dozen candidates stand up and speak, and then the delegates all vote, the result would be seen as fair. And if it’s a fresh face from a swing state, it could be a new start, which is what a majority of Americans are desperately hoping for.",coleman57,2024-07-04T10:13:25,7

"Not with a deadlocked Congress he can’t. Especially with federal courts hamstringing the administrative state. If we vote in a Dem majority in both houses, things could rapidly improve. If not, not.   Also, rampant inflation ended over 12 months ago. Housing remains a pain point due to high interest rates.

"If Trump refuses to debate Biden again, it's not like the event just gets canceled. The network will do what they did with the canceled debate in 2020 and give Biden a town hall. That gives Biden a unilateral chance to connect with voters in a format that's much more favorable to him, at a point where there are a ton of eyes on the campaign.

And second, we already have a candidate who is the clear winner for the nomination. I don't know if Biden could release his delegates for anyone other than Harris, presumably that would be decided by the rules committee and the rules committee doesn't make the rules until the convention starts, but if he did, you'd have infighting between the establishment and progressives that would spill over onto the floor. Nothing about it would be nice, and the party would leave the convention with a nominee, but also with a fractured party.",SouthOfOz,2024-07-04T10:26:17,6

"I appreciate your commitment to good faith debate and seek to extend that commitment with my own response.  As unreliable as the Left has been in previous elections, most notably 2016, the election of Biden in 2020 brought the Left into the fold of the Democratic base.  I would also like to pause here to hit home on the idea that the Left is an ideological grouping, which is substantially different from a gendered grouping, racial grouping, or any other grouping that relates to social standing. The Left includes many black voters, many white voters, many asian voters, many Native American voters, many mixed-race voters, many men voters, many women voters, many non-binary/trans voters, etc.  Ideological grouping bridges many of the divides that we usually create when discussing electoral politics. To categorize the hypothetical race for the nomination, should Biden step away, as an either-or scenario is, unfortunately, reductive.  I think we can do both, and I think we can do both well. Kamala Harris is not the nominee that will unite the Democratic base.   I refuse to endorse any particular hypothetical candidate, but my choice would be heavily swayed by electability among the Democratic base and electability in the broader electorates of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona.  edit: spelling; formatted to provide a better reader experience",[deleted],2024-07-04T10:24:01,3
