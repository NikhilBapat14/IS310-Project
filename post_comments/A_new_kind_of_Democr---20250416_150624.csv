"Wow. This guy was created in a lab to run for office in Iowa.  The DSCC needs to not fuck this up.  This is the direction that Democrats need to go. They've been playing it one size fits all for too long. They seriously look at Iowa and think ""How can we get another pragmatic moderate like Amy Klobuchar, but in Iowa version?"" They need to do some deep reflecting, because Minnesota and Iowa are neighbors but are also fundamentally different states. Iowa has much more of a populist streak than Minnesota. Whereas Minnesotans are just plain progressive. Their populism can go both ways. Obama won in Iowa in 2008 and 2012 because he was perceived as a populist. Republicans claimed that mantel. And if Democrats want to win it back, they need to let candidates like this take a shot. Unknown, but also known enough by locals to attest to his character.  Iowa is chock full of Obama-Trump voters. Find a message that works there and you've just won the 2028 election. Those voters are a serious target if the economy sours.  Also, in Minnesota, we have an open Senate seat. But it's the same old faces getting up to run: The Lt. Gov., whose only notable experience before was 2 years in the legislature (Walz was ticking a box; he declined to endorse her candidacy for senate). A suburban congresswoman, who has ties to pharma. And a smattering of other creatures of the Twin Cities. It's no fucking wonder the once-blue rural Iron Range thinks we're abandoning them. Dems can afford to do that in MN, but not in IA.

"Mostly, it was the fact that the Democratic party sat on their butts and let a guy like Trump get away scot free with the blatant crimes he was committing that he wasn't even hiding what he was doing, when he should have been tried, convicted, and in prison within weeks of the end of his first (I can't believe I'm saying that word) presidency, despite the Democrats having the power to easily squash Trump like a bug at any time from 2020-2024. The fact that what the Democrats did accomplish wasn't shouted from the rooftops and instead they kept going ""Trump sucks!"" ad nauseam until people tuned it out didn't help either.     Trump has the charisma of a dead sewer rat, so it wasn't that either.
