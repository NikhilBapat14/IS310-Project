"Google: ""Despite Hitler's aggressive rearmament, western powers remained largely inactive. Instead, they pursued a strategy known as 'Appeasement' - the policy of acceding to the demands of a potentially hostile nation in the hope of maintaining peace.""",whateveryousaymydear,2025-04-30T00:04:58,20

"Apart from the 1930s corporate nationalism (which is fascism), this is such a clear example of how corporations are essentially nihilists. They do not care about anything human, any notion of truth, any reality. Corporatism is a full on collapse of human rationale, and it is a pity they try to ornate themselves as rational institutions.",csscp,2025-04-30T01:03:46,7
"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > Countries big and small are turning to Wall Street banks for guidance on how to navigate Trump’s global trade war. Bankers have advised that negotiations with the Trump administration could be affected by issues that have nothing to do with trade and might require political or symbolic concessions to the White House.  > France and Saudi Arabia are among the other governments that have spoken with Goldman on negotiating with the Trump administration, people familiar with the matter said.  > Japan has also consulted with Goldman on how to address Trump’s allegations that its tax system effectively subsidizes exports to the disadvantage of U.S. manufacturers. In talks with the bank, the Japanese government expressed skepticism about changing its tax policies just to please the administration, people familiar with the matter said.   > Wall Street’s biggest banks advise corporate clients on all manner of business, from mergers, IPOs and restructurings to major capital projects. They also regularly provide guidance to foreign governments, and talks have accelerated and become more urgent with Trump’s return to the White House.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-30T00:00:49,6

"Their advice is “concessions”? Lol.  Why would you ask an American financial firm for advice in this though. Their advice will clearly be more motivated by what’s in their best interest, not your national interest. They want the trade war to end. Of course they will say give “concessions”.",Trillion_2233,2025-04-30T00:18:24,10
"Vietnam already capitulated completely to anything Trump wanted.  And they were still tariffed!    Canada and Japan *tried negotiating with The USA* but there was nobody to negotiate with!  The funny thing is that Trump got exactly what he said he wanted, most countries tried to capitulate and give Trump whatever he asked for that wasn't impossible, but the guy was so stupid that he didn't think about step 2 after Tariffs!  He never asked for anything!",kia75,2025-04-30T01:38:41,7
