"So you're telling me, that all of those paranoid freaks who always ran around screeching about ""Big government surveillance"" or ""muh phone is listenin' to me""....almost always right wingers too, are totally on board with this and see zero problem, why? Because it's THEIR team that doing all of this. Because they have decided to all rally around Elon as their new savior and hero,, it's all ok now. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüëå",LivingIndependence,2025-04-19T11:54:33,49
"Concluding Paragraph:  The privacy implications of this cross-agency database would not only violate numerous privacy laws and cause cybersecurity risks, but could also become a potent weapon for whomever can access said database: it could be used by the government to conduct mass surveillance of whomever they wished to target, such as immigrants, or become a target for outside actors seeking a trove of private and personal data. Either way, ‚Äúit‚Äôs terrifying,‚Äù John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Nextgov, adding that this was exactly what the Privacy Act was supposed to prevent. ‚ÄúAggregation of data is building a weapon, essentially, and it‚Äôs one that can be used in a lot of different ways.‚Äù",D-R-AZ,2025-04-19T10:49:04,25
"There have been a few executive orders that directly relate to this and the growing malignancy that is DOGE.  Granted full access to Federal officials appointed by the President or Agency Heads (or their designees) to all unclassified agency record, data, software systems, and IT systems. This effectively removes any restrictive leashes on DOGE in their access to digital systems of federal offices, save for the necessary restrictions on classified information.

To note, however; this does not apply to classified information or classified information systems.

"They'll be training a Palantir AI on this database for sure. Palantir's AI is used in a lot of applications, but mostly in police and military. Supposedly founded off the anti-fraud tech that was used in Paypal. It is really, really dangerous that our government is about to have an AI making recommendations on who to prosecute - one built by a very politicized administration and the most corrupt influence in our nation's history.  When Democrats are not pushing on a specific issue, they need to be strategizing for how to decouple this AI and message about how serious the problem could be. Privacy laws aside, since no one fundamentally understands the decisions an AI is making and whether it is hallucinating or not, our government and the laws we write can't be guaranteed will be followed by an AI.",ICanLiftACarUp,2025-04-19T11:36:25,8
