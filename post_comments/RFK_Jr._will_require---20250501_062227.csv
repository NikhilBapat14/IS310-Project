I mean if RFK wants to question the efficacy of vaccines (i assume if he wants placebo testing) he can look to the most recent outbreak of Measles that happened under his watch   Most of the outbreak cases? Unvaccinated or unknown vaccine status lmao   It also Seems kinda fucked up to make someone think they are getting vaccine protection and inject them with saline instead especially if they are fully consenting and willing to get the vaccine...if they get vaccinated and still have a case of the disease that alone will give you an idea of how much efficacy there is ,blues111,2025-05-01T06:35:37,15

First of all many new vaccines use data from old studies of other similar vaccines in their data collection for FDA approval. And this is allowed by the FDA. There should be all new data for all trials as well as placebo group.    Boosters especially. Is the booster effective or is it natural immunity? Is it necessary to put a pharmaceutical concoction in your blood when the benefits of it are miniscule?   When a new variant comes out along with a new booster and people are getting heart problems....is it the booster or the variant?  New studies with placebo groups determine that!    And the flu vaccines are exempt from this new rule. Its exempt because we have 80 years of data.  Not 4 years of questionable like Covid. ,EdderMoney,2025-05-02T07:17:16,1

"Without consent (so under this president, likely) giving a fake vaccine is unethical for several reasons. But what I'm concerned about is giving people *literal* fake vaccines is unfathomably dangerous.  Not only will you not actually get herd immunity (contaminating any study on efficacy in a population) you would wildly increase vaccine skepticism if half the people getting ""vaccinated"" had 0 protection from illness.   I expect an EO laying out this plan tomorrow....",scubahood86,2025-05-01T07:16:45,7
"You inject some people with saline and compare the infection rates to the ones who got the real vaccine, it's a thing.   But it's a thing that takes too long for seasonally-updated vaccines like flu and COVID to do every time they update. By the time they got results the strain they needed to target would be different already.",pervocracy,2025-05-01T06:37:08,18
"It happens. In fact, the covid shot already had that done.  But it is unethical with certain diseases. And now covid is one as we understand the immune response and can directly study the response. Placebo studies are indirect studies.",HopeFloatsFoward,2025-05-01T06:45:17,10
My son received the placebo for the Covid vaccine during the trial. You can definitely do a placebo for something that has no current vaccine. It would be unethical to use a placebo for something that a vaccine exists for though.,I_eat_all_the_cheese,2025-05-01T06:52:20,5
Happens all the time. You can placebo test virtually anything.,EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-01T07:35:59,0
"and people would be amazed at how many times placebos beat the drug for efficacy.  Give people a blue sugar pill shaped like a triangle, they will get a boner.  Germany did a massive trial of anti-depressant drugs, vs St. John's wort, vs placebo. Over 9,000 enrolled. Placebo won.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-01T11:47:16,0
