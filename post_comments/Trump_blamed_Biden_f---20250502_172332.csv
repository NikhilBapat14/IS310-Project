"A) 90 percent of his supporters will believe anything he says.  B) 10 percent know he's full of shit but don't care.  C) Let's not suck the market off too much, it's still down 2 percent in the last 30 days.",Grey_0ne,2025-05-02T17:27:09,96

"Stocks are not ""soaring"". This is just more media playing into Trump's propaganda: If you pay me two dollars, and later I give you one dollar back... can I claim that you're one dollar richer?  My 401K is still down over 5% from when Trump was inaugurated.",youreallcucks,2025-05-02T19:04:34,24
Going to Costco today was like seeing people stock up for the Apocalypse. I think that might be one reason the stock market is doing fine. It's as artificial as the felon's hairline.,Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T17:51:57,29

Gaining 1.4% after losing 16% after the inauguration is far from 'soaring'.,nwgdad,2025-05-02T21:25:11,9
The stock markets aren't soaring.  Trump has been pretty quiet about tarriffs lately.  So stocks have merely returned to the state they were right before Trump started his tarriff wars.

"I’d say 60% know exactly right from wrong and they know exactly why things are bad.

And still way down overall. Any increase is not the goal. The goal is to regain all that was lost and then keep going. Obviously we won’t hit this goal with Mangolini,jgoble15,2025-05-02T22:12:04,1
Every time it bounces that’s the insider trading as his cronies steal wealth at a discount.   Step 1: Create crisis   Step 2: Ordinary investors that can’t weather it lose their shirts  Step 3: Tell the people that have bribed you that you’re going to “fix” the problem that you created and when it will happen  Step 4: Gut all oversight   Step 5: billionaires scoop up shares at rock bottom prices   Step 6: Announce that you’ve solved the problem you started  Step 7: Billionaires enjoy the profit from the recovery and sell off what they want to the next batch of ordinary investors  Step 8: Repeat until you’ve destroyed the economy ,johhnny5,2025-05-03T12:24:12,1

"It’s gotten beyond stupid. Somehow, someway, my dad thinks Elon is going to give us all UBI so when I’m his age* I won’t need Medicare or Social Security, things he very much benefits from but is fine with taking away. If someone is that far gone, then nothing is going to change their mind.     Besides, there’s at least some small chance that Elon wants to feed us all to a vengeful AI death god and may even believe he has to do so to avoid eternal torment in a simulated hell. It’s the most bananas insane bullshit I may have ever heard even as far as other cults go, but he hangs with people who really like that idea. Personally, I think he just has genocidal tendencies. He’s definitely not getting us UB-fucking-I.   *and I won’t make it that far, he’s older even than Trump, and I’m not a well person.",downhereforyoursoul,2025-05-02T19:41:18,3
"It’s literally the chaos of nobody knowing what way the winds blow on tariffs. It drops every time tariffs go live and jumps when they get delayed. Rn the stock market is bouncing due to uncertainty, when quarterly reports are filed and reported on shit will hit the fan again.  The difference between a conservative and a progressive is that one thinks they can boil everything in life down to simple one term answers while the other knows that the world is complex and there’s many reasons why things are the way they are.

"Ah yes I knew there was a horrible reason for it thank you lol  >Derived from the idea that ""even a dead cat will bounce if it falls from a great height"", the phrase is also popularly applied to any case where a subject experiences a brief resurgence during or following a severe decline.
