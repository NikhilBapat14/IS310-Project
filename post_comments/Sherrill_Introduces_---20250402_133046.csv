"Is it not required for any and all government officials to be drug tested? Think that should be an annual thing at least. If people gotta piss in a cup for a job making them under 50k, government officials can piss in a cup.",NimDing218,2025-04-02T16:44:36,14

I would assume it depends on the department but don't most workplaces reserve the right to drug test you?,Rosebunse,2025-04-02T17:31:45,3
