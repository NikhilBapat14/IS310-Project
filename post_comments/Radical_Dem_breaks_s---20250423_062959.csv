">[Rep Maxwell] Frost [FL], who recently made headlines for flying to El Salvador to visit deported illegal immigrant and alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was heavily criticized on social media after a seemingly cryptic tweet from 2016 resurfaced reading ""f----- wit my gang gon get u spilled.""  The post was in response to tweets including one by an account named ""Hits LeBlunt."" The line is from the song ""Gang"" by rapper ""Max P.""  The post generated a spate of concern and condemnation, with many saying it was unbecoming of a member of Congress to have such a post on his official account.",Sodola321,2025-04-23T07:23:26,3
