"Trump’s overall approval rating is lower than it was only two months ago. **The poll shows that 39 percent of adult Americans approve of the way Trump is handling his job**, compared with 55 percent who disapprove, including 44 percent who disapprove strongly. In February, those numbers were 45 percent positive and 53 percent negative.",Competitive_Ad291,2025-04-27T22:29:09,15
"The stupidest thing about these polls is it reveals there are clearly millions of Americans that voted for Trump to burn down the government and the global trading system, then when he does it, they disapprove!!  WTF is wrong with these people - Trump is doing EXACTLY what he said he would do, in exactly the way everyone knew he would do it.

He will say he doesn't care and play off that he's bought into some fantasy poll numbers but, at the end of the day, this kind of stuff gets to him because his whole life has been one desperate attempt at acceptance.  But he's a lame duck, how it affects him doesn't really matter. It's how it affects Republican lawmakers. Their fate is tied to Trump, if his numbers get low enough and they see him as an albatross, they absolutely will throw him under the bus. They turned on Dubya and the GOP actually liked him.

"There’s nuance to the numbers and their significance, for what it’s worth. What decides modern US elections is basically who bothers to show up to vote and who stays home. Trump has a solid chunk of information-immune cultists, that’s true (although I don’t think he’s quite his his floor yet; I think it’s somewhere from 33-36% where he’d be at rock bottom), but the shifts in approval rating somewhat mask the shift in sentiment that they represent / the change in turnout they’d produce. I’d wager to guess if the election was redone now it’d be a blowout loss for Trump, virtually regardless of who was running against him.",Devilnaht,2025-04-28T00:39:15,11

"Then you clearly don't understand how elections work in the United States. America is very unique in that our elections are decentralized, meaning a good 97% of the process is controlled by the states and not the federal government.       So holding an illegitimate election is a very difficult undertaking, and it's the states who will uphold the integrity. And, I'm not going to say it's not possible for a POTUS and his cabinet to mess with the election process, but I think it would have to be someone a lot more competent than Trump.       Also, Trump has shown that he's kind of a coward. He's already blinked and reversed course on several policy announcements that were wildly unpopular with the public. Keep in mind, a dictator in a country the size of the United States need some degree of popularity to stay in power. A lot more than what Trump has. Americans, and other countries, are so fixated on the blatant corruption and autocracy, that we fail to realize Putin is actually quite popular with the majority of the Russian public. That's in part because he framed things like reining in the oligarchs as something he did for their benefit because he's a man of the people. Things Putin does that we find horrifying, like persecuting the LGBTQ+ community, are overwhelmingly supported by the Russian public.       Trump kind of screwed up by overplaying his hand so hard and early at this phase of his presidency. If he had just coasted on the Biden economy and slowly implemented his abhorrent policies, then people probably would being paying less attention. But he went all in and this time ""flooding the zone with shit"" isn't working because all the shit is sticking and people are managing to be angry about cuts to government funding, be angry at the deportations and imprisonments, and be angry at the tariffs simultaneously.  Like, I don't think you realize how unprecedented it is for a POTUS to sink this quickly in popularity. Even during his first term, while his favorability went under a lot faster, it still stayed pretty consistent. That ain't happening this time. It's sinking like a rock. Even the best that biased Republican pollsters can manage is to keep him like +1% above water.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-28T01:36:08,5

"You aren't telling me anything I don't already know, but what I'm telling you is that Trump can absolutely terrorize the country with the ~30+% of Americans who will never accept reality.  The government is being dismantled and everything is a loyalty test. Every state doesn't need to cave to his whims. He can still win nearly half of them legitimately anyway.  There is a very real risk that we don't get an election at all, let alone a legitimate one.  The man doesn't need a majority to start a second civil war.  You may have seen folks talk about getting 3% of Americans to actively protest and how that would shut down the country and force change.  Imagine if Trump drums up just 3% of the country, because they damn near all have AR-15s. Hell, half of them are cops with government resources.  This is a real threat, and after Jan 6th, the entire government knows it.  If anybody tries too hard to reign him in and backs him into a corner, he will absolutely cry to his most violent supporters for help.",lordagr,2025-04-28T02:00:11,10
