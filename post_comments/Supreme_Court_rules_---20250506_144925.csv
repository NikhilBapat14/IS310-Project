"The military has to be exclusionary.  The military discriminates to determine who is best fit to serve.  This is no different than refusing people with poor eyesight, being physically unfit, with prior medical conditions or mental health disorders.  The Military gets to set its standards, not an activist, not a judge and not congress.  That power resides within the Executive Branch solely.  Additionally, they have to be on meds constantly. So on board ship or out in the field it is not possible to be taking meds every day. Small ships like destroyers cannot stock the amount of meds needed for just one person.  And giving a waiver, like Biden did, to not have to deploy is not fair to the rest of the Service",Status_Control_9500,2025-05-06T18:35:19,8
"There are a lot of people who have no business being in the military.   Most of basic & training, we used to say, was an elimination process more than anything.   I remember an overwhelming amount of people being admin sep’d just prior to even their first permanent duty station.   Look, it’s just not for everyone - and that’s okay. It’s not even for a lot of people who presume it’s for.   And it is definitely *not* for the blue-haired, piercings, ‘my rights’ sort of individual.  They will more than likely not be able to adapt to being an individual with military bearing.   A lot of us remember that fucking embarrassing shitbag that couldn’t get right & somehow missed the cut.   Let’s not have more of that. Peoples lives are in danger. The service is too relaxed as it is.   Welcome to the UCMJ.",nautik4,2025-05-06T21:12:34,8
