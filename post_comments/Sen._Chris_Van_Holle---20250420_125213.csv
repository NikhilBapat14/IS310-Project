"I don't think anyone's convinced by the ""look, we all hate MS-13 here, but we just want him brought back and deported the right way-- it's about rule of law!"" approach.

"Its only because Trump did it. If by some miracle he had been sent away a year ago, none of them would care.",VeryPokey,2025-04-20T18:38:04,21
