">A classroom where kids will be escorted out every time information about an LGBTQ person or subject comes up is one in which, ultimately, those subjects will be [suppressed](https://www.motherjones.com/mojo-wire/2022/03/dont-say-gay-bill-republicans-florida-ron-desantis/). The few parents who want to shield their children from knowledge about LGBTQ people may go a long way toward eradicating the idea of their existence from American classrooms. We know this opt-out route doesn’t work because the school district already tried it three years ago —and, as my colleague Sarah Szilagy [explains](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/the-parental-rights-movement-has-a-big-day-at-the-supreme-court/), it failed.  >Alan Schoenfeld, the attorney who represented the county board of education, said that would be coercion. But the example demonstrated Alito’s long-held belief that LGBTQ rights are actually a vehicle for attacks on religious people like himself.  >Then there’s this (lightly edited) [exchange](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2024/24-297_p8k0.pdf) between Alito and Schoenfeld, in which Alito grows increasingly upset at the idea that children should hear a positive portrayal of two men getting married, as happens in one of the books raised in the case, [*Uncle Bobby’s Wedding*](https://bookshop.org/p/books/uncle-bobby-s-wedding-sarah-s-brannen/). Like Barrett, Alito argued that a positive portrayal of an LGBTQ issue is intrinsically coercive. The back-and-forth gets at the key question in the case: Is exposure to a fact or idea a burden or form of coercion on religious expression?  >Kavanaugh and Barrett, whose kids are still young, must know this. Alito and the other Republican-appointed justices surely do as well. But the infeasibility is really the point. If you can’t actually accommodate some parent’s opt-out requests, then the religious beliefs of those parents begin to dictate what is discussed in the classroom. If you can’t feasibly remove students every time a book is opened, or every time a student raises their hand to ask what transgender means, then that content is ultimately silenced, and with it the idea that LGBTQ people exist, much less are normal and deserving of respect. It’s why some commenters have taken to calling this the “[Don’t Say Gay](https://www.vox.com/scotus/408356/supreme-court-mahmoud-taylor-dont-say-gay)” case—because that’s where it leads.  It's not ""Don't say Gay"". It's ""Don't Be Gay"". Christian nationalists have made it abundantly clear that they do not want queer people to exist in any capacity and under any circumstances. They want all LGBTQIA+ people to be pushed out of life and into a grave. That's their mission, and there's a word for that: genocide.",southpawFA,2025-04-23T17:07:00,34
