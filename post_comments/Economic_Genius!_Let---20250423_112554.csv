Come on lets go all the way... force companies to tally their profits weekly and pay everyone an equal amount of the profits.  /sarcasm,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-23T11:38:47,11
"The minimum wage needs to go, altogether. Price controls never work, and that's all the minimum wage is. And it's a price control that removes people from contributing to society and their own support.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-23T11:47:22,13

"So if I make $50 currently, does that mean my pay will increase 7 fold? So Iâ€™ll be getting $350 an hour. Or will I be making the same as a burger flipper. In that case, Iâ€™ll flip burgers.",GroundbreakingPick11,2025-04-23T19:26:13,2

"Politicians buying votes ***do not care*** how economics work.

"I could actually get behind that for some companies/jobs, but with the amount being proportional to position/title/experience. . .at least to demonstrate how little profit some places actually make.  For example, a fast food restaurant has twenty workers who all want $2000/week, total cost of $40k/week. . . it'd be quite a shock when the location barely broke $5k profit after expenses.. . .and that was a good week. . .either way here's your check for $250, of and let's also take out taxes, FICA, 401k, other benefits. . .here's your $50 for the week.",xAdakis,2025-04-23T12:07:37,9
"And when the economy is down or the business loses money, the employees share the risk and have to pay the company to cover the loss! Share the profits, share the losses.. wait, what do you mean you only want all the reward with none of the risk??",dire76,2025-04-23T13:45:21,4
At least there's no reason for a federal minimum wage let the states and local municipalities work it out amongst themselves,s1lentchaos,2025-04-23T12:57:37,7

"Quickie rule of thumb - there are    ~about 2080 work hours in a year, 40hrs/week x 52 weeks = 2,080    So take the hourly wage and double it for approx salary.  So a $50/hr job is a bit above $100kâ€¦    ($50 x 2080 =$104,000)",cliffotn,2025-04-23T14:44:40,3

"True wasn't sure since you are close stating the average fast food franchise generates between 5,000-8,000 profit weekly. I think having a % profit share with employees are a great incentive to getting the most out of your employees",FunkyMonkss,2025-04-23T12:51:00,2
