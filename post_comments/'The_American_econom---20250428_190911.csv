"Will this happen before or after the complete financial collapse?   I think these people need to quit getting high on their own flatulence, and go outside and touch some grass. Seriously, why can’t they see what the entire world can see?   In the future, when the truth is revealed about the use of social media to manipulate millions of people, it will be far too late. AI is only going to accelerate intellectual decline and social decay.   We are on the road to a place we cannot return from. And all for the enrichment of people who already have more than they could spend in one hundred lifetimes.   Dystopian, indeed.",Jamizon1,2025-04-28T20:41:36,1
