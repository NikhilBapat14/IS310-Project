This should be filed under 'European civilizational suicide update'.  What is the British government doing plugging one religion over others? Particularly the one religion that fosters hatred and intolerance more than any other?  I suppose this is the British version of DEI.  Madness.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-30T07:53:22,157

"That is quite literally the opposite of the best decision ever. Accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior is the best decision ever, that way you can be forgiven and spend eternity with the true Living God.",Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-30T07:52:23,74

"Itâ€™s wild to me that so many leftists hate on Christianity.  But theyâ€™ll turn around and support/embrace Islam, even with the knowledge of all of the attacks that can be blamed on extremist views of that faith.  Even milder forms of Islam can be a threat to western ideals that we all love.    Whatâ€™s their deal?",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-01T14:42:16,4

Almost all western countries. The US has the luck it did import south Americans in big numbers and not Muslims and arabs. The former share quite some values with western culture while the latter opposes it in almast every facet.,The_Asian_Viper,2025-04-30T14:59:44,17

"To each their own. Muslims believe their religion just as fervently as Christians. I'm not a fan of Islam, but it's interesting how you believe in the same god, but have different main prophets.Â    While I think the New Testament is a far better doctrine than the Quran, there is the contention that Muhammad actually existed and there is no corroboration in history that Jeshua did.Â    Both afterlifes are hopes and dreams, and I find the idea that I can be a good person, but not follow Jesus or Muhammad, and be condemned for it pretty crappy. A God who punishes people for not ascribing to a particular religion based on chance or faith, is not a good God.   Both religions say God is good, therefore I don't need to follow either religion if either is supposed to be true. Just be a good person and instead of constraining your mind by dogma, use the good stuff as a guide, and leave the bad behind.",PFirefly,2025-04-30T08:34:55,-25
"Virtue signaling manifesting itself in an ethno-sociological self-hatred. In other words, hating the ""white, Christian patrimony"" is seen as virtuous, particularly by white liberals.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-02T09:01:16,5

"God doesn't punish anyone. You punish yourself. He gave us free will, so you are your own end result. Also, with the findings in Jerusalem, the shroud of Turin, the dead sea scrolls, and others, there is a lot of evidence to prove Jesus existed, which also proves God exists.",caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-30T08:44:33,-3

"There is no factually based evidence or third party documentation that Jesus existed. The scrolls prove nothing more than any of the included gospels do, and the shroud of Turin isn't even dated to the correct period even if you don't want to believe anything else that shows it's a hoax.

Guess who the father is? Yahweh. The same god worshiped by all Abrahamic religions. Just because you lump him in with a couple others and call it a trinity doesn't change much.,PFirefly,2025-04-30T11:05:31,7

"So I'm an apologist for saying the Abrahamic religions have a lot it common? Trust me bud, I have no love lost for Islam. I've spent my entire adult life deployed to various 3rd world shitholes were I saw firsthand the worst of religous fundamentalism. That doesn't change the fact that Judaism, Christianity and Islam are different branches of the same tree..",Grouchy_Map7133,2025-04-30T11:41:04,8

"I meant that Jesus started spreading the message. If you wanna be precise sure, the apostles did, but Christianity wouldn't exist without Jesus. And if you wanna be really precise (otherwise you would not have replied this) even if one is not Christian this is still history, as real as Caesar and other historical figures, so it doesn't matter if you don't believe it LOL",Guinguaggio,2025-05-01T13:51:20,2

"Only certain sects of Christianity believe that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are literally one being. That's hardly universal. Even if you do believe in that version, it doesn't change what god you worship, it only changes how you interpret that god.  Literally all the same god, just worshipped in different ways and different interpretations. Judaism and Islam having different thoughts about Jesus doesn't change that the supreme god is supposed to be Yahweh.  \------  Side note, I find literal interpretations to be interesting.  When Jesus was baptized he was filled with the holy spirit, and God spoke saying here is my beloved son. So he spoke about how he was his own son and then gave himself an extra helping of power/authority that was also himself. God likes to talk in confusing terms and keep a reserve of power from himself until he feels like it.  Jesus prayed to God in Gethsemane and according to Luke, God sent and angel to strengthen him. So he prayed to himself, and sent himself an angel to make himself feel better?   Also in Gethsemane, Jesus cried out to God for the cup to be taken from him, but that he would endure if it was his will. So he cried out to himself to not force himself to go through the full pomp and circumstance of crucifixion, but that he would do what he told himself if he required it, of himself.     Sorry, not trying to be antagonistic in this last bit, I didn't grow up Catholic or Protestant, so I don't know how they deal with this while sticking to a literal trinity of one being. I'd be curious if you had any resources for it so I can further my knowledge.",PFirefly,2025-04-30T14:35:04,6
