"China is starting to realize that their systems will not work against such tariffs.  But I would be cautious of them, as they will adjust once the tariffs are over.",mdws1977,2025-05-02T10:51:25,202
This us just shy of a 3rd of our exports to china if anyone is curious.   140b total,ultrainstict,2025-05-02T19:01:02,6
"So, we exempt phones and computer parts, they exempt pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals.  The only difference is we announced our exemptions and they simply decided to not collect their tariffs.  This is how it has to be for China.  They can't been seen to be bowing to the United States but they also know they can't win a trade war with us.  What this all is is language.  This is us saying something, them saying something.  We reply, they reply.  Eventually, we will get to a point of equilibrium and matters will stabilize.  It may or may not involve a comprehensive trade deal...just a quid pro quo existent arrangement.  Regardless, if Trump is anything he's pro America and won't likely allow even an informal arrangement to be too injurious to our economy.  Between the recent news of an imminent trade agreement with India and with the news of our future access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine...the Chinese position continues to weaken and their leverage erodes over time.  Once the Indian deal gets finalized the pressure really goes up because India is a regional rival of China.  More money to India, less to China...and the longer we deal with India in the absence of a Chinese deal, supply chains get established and cemented and unless a Chinese deal is substantially more attractive than the Indian one, buyers (that's us) won't bother to switch back.  There are news reports of Chinese factories shutting down and this very news article hints at job losses between 5 and 10 million and it's still very early in this tariff tit for tat.  If China's actual population is around 700 million then we would be roughly half their size.  Imagine the societal upheaval if we were to experience 2.5 to 5 million jobs lost in less than 60 days (Trump's first tariff moves v China were February 4).  Time is not on their side.  All we truly need to do is patiently wait them out...which is what we're doing.",Euroranger,2025-05-02T11:46:11,80

This is great news to most except the miserable loser leftists who have been in China's corner because they would rather see China come out on top then have the bad Orange Man succeed. ,Pinot_Greasio,2025-05-02T10:49:52,254
"Unlike Trump's exemptions of Chinese electronic products,...which benefited American consumers, these exemptions are mostly for manufacturers in need of certain American materials. Problem for China is that the products being manufactured no longer have a buyer. They're scrambling world-wide for buyers. My guess is that rather than shut down the factories and deal with the resulting social dislocations, the Chinese will keep producing and build up huge stores of warehoused goods that they'll try to dump on the world market for far below the cost of production. It's not a rational economy....because it's being managed by an irrational political system....one that is wedded to ideology (and its practical corollary, appearances)....above all else.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-02T12:11:32,23
"Ironically, I'm sure the folks at /r/Anticonsumption will still be upset. This is how crazy the leftist cult is. They were all against ""cheap Chinese crap"" until the tariffs, now they are all, ""we're all gonna die!""",obscurityknocks,2025-05-02T12:57:33,25
"Keep going, crush them",Spartanlegion117,2025-05-02T11:24:49,29
We did the same thing with phones and other electronics. Its just a song and dance between us and China. Let's see who blinks first,specter491,2025-05-02T14:55:01,7

I’m so fucking tired of the “but China says this and that”  They’re a communist country that controls the media. Why in the actual hell would ANYBODY believe what they’re saying?,sledge07,2025-05-02T17:06:52,4

"They know their situation very well, their economy is extremely micro managed.   Like the US they are negotiating from a stance of “power”, be it 100% real, or fake as can be - they’ll behave as if they hold all the cards.    If I’m closing on a car the last thing I do is tell the car salesman “hey, can you please cut me a deal?  I need a car yesterday!”.  I make it clear they’ll have to deal, because I’m in zero hurry.  And I’ll walk out the door without any hesitation.",cliffotn,2025-05-02T11:58:48,108
"Adjust or not, Xi is crucifying himself… Trump’s tariff’s haven’t helped, but China was slipping long before Trump entered office.  If China eventually agrees to “fair” trade, this would be a boom for the American economy.  Trump and his staff are continually knocking it out of the park.",BerniWrightson,2025-05-02T14:39:43,41
>> If China's actual population is around 700 million  Where did this figure come from? I remember learning in school in the 2000’s that China had a population of over 1 billion,MulticamTropic,2025-05-02T16:15:50,35

Exactly.  Seeing all these people *angry that the market is going green* is so fucking revealing. Just another excuse to hate Trump for them without realizing what they're rooting for,Enchylada,2025-05-02T11:29:28,25
Sad but true.  The Leftist are just a pathetic group. They would rather see China succeeding than Trump and US succeeding.,Juclaq,2025-05-02T12:47:34,9

Trump's tweets exist in a strange realm where he makes the most sensible and agreeable points while being as provocative and absurd as he can.,Scamandrius,2025-05-02T11:48:55,84
