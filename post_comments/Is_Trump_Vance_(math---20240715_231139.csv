"I think ""George Washington and John Adams"" have the fewest years as an elected official before becoming President and Vice President with <1 year combined.  Now realistically that shouldn't count but I believe it is technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.",ResidentBackground35,2024-07-16T11:38:23,52

"I think weighing the value of the experience should be important too. 4 years as the president should weigh more than 4 years as a mayor, for example.",Halostar,2024-07-16T10:39:54,19
"I can't recall any, nor can I find any looking up the ones I remember for being thin on previous elected office, there are some others which seem to only have 6-8ish years cumulative elected office experience (at least insofar as their wikipedia entries cover their prior offices, which I cannot be certain how much they cover minor local offices, but they certainly cover congress/governorships and such).  Woodrow Wilson and his vp for one;  Eisenhower/nixon for another.  Digging up info on the losing tickets is more time consuming, and I don't know most of them in detail enough to say for sure, but it does seem like a rarity.  edit:  I came across this entry in wikipedia after a bit of other browsing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_previous_experience",zlefin_actual,2024-07-16T10:09:18,3
"Would say 4 years as president makes you anyway more experienced than any governor, but apart from that and before that, indeed",intriguedspark,2024-07-16T11:10:06,3
"In more recent years, I would say so. The character traits and experience or quality of a candidate that was once admired or considered a prerequisite for higher offices mean very little now.   The parties now just seek to capitalize on what their respective base wants to hear even if that means America as a country suffers and becomes more divided.",PsychLegalMind,2024-07-18T12:28:45,1
"If your only metric is ""elected office"" then there are comparable situations. JD Vance will have served 2 years before becoming VP so technically that's 4+2. That makes this ticket equivalent to Eisenhower + Nixon (0 + 6 years)",FiveDollarHoller,2024-07-19T10:36:07,1

"Washington had 16 years of elected experience in the Virginia House of Burgesses (equivalent to a state legislature).   John Adams also had a couple of years of local elected office. Being elected Surveyor of Highways in his hometown of Braintree, Massachusetts from 1765-1766 and as Selectman (equivalent to a city council member) from 1766-1769. Granted, being a city councilman in a town with less than a thousand residents is nothing compared to being a Congressman or Governor, but still.",ABTARS8142000,2024-07-16T12:09:13,33
"I am enjoying the history lesson in this reddit post.  I dig just a bit of digging in Geroge Washington and see he was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1758.  And served 7 years.  I enjoyed hearing about him swaying voters with beer, brandy and other beverages!  I assume this makes George Washington/Adams not technically correct?  Who knows.     From Wijipedia:  ""Washington held local offices and was elected to the Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years beginning in 1758.[^(\[56\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEllis200441%E2%80%9342,_48-61) He first ran for the seat in 1755 but was soundly beaten by Hugh West.[^(\[57\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#cite_note-62)[^(\[58\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington#cite_note-63) When he ran in 1758, Washington plied voters with beer, brandy, and other beverages. Despite being away serving on the Forbes Expedition, he won the election with roughly 40 percent of the vote, defeating three opponents with the help of local supporters.""",Voluntari,2024-07-16T12:18:51,7
"I believe it's technically not correct because Washington/Adams wasn't a ""ticket"". Adams was just the second most vote getter after Washington. They didn't campaign together or anything.  The first informal tickets didn't happen until Washington declared he wouldn't run in 1796 and John Adams/Thomas Pickney ran against Thomas Jefferson/Aaron Burr. Formally they were all running for President, but each party had a plan to try to get one less vote for their informal Vice President candidate. The plans didn't work though, and John Adams was elected President while Thomas Jefferson was elected Vice President.  The first formal tickets happened in 1804 after the passing of the 12th Amendment made the President and Vice President elections separate. Thomas Jefferson/George Clinton beat Charles Pickney/Rufus King.",matthoback,2024-07-16T15:21:10,5

"Couldn't agree more. Jill Stein could credibly claim winning more elections and have more electoral experience than JD Vance after having won 2 elections for town assembly. Sure, that's a combined 1000 votes, but if you squint hard enough the numbers check out.",scubafork,2024-07-16T10:50:37,10
That's a good start but I would add there is a nearly-impossible metric to quantify in there: how much did TFG actually learn about governance and the roles & duties of the president during their time in office?,Dr_Adequate,2024-07-16T11:33:12,4
"Being governor is akin to being president of a state. They sign bills into law, they have the authority to give pardons, etc. They can call out the national guard when they wish. Great in times of emergency, but many have abused that as us old folks recall with [Kent State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_State_shootings)  and historians studied [The Ludlow Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre)",Swiggy1957,2024-07-16T11:45:57,5
"Not to single anyone out, but not all presidencies are created equal. Some presidents leave office no better at the job then when they started, while others make huge transformations. ",valvilis,2024-07-16T22:52:23,2
"Definitely not. Someone with 8 years as a governor has way more experience doing all the functions of an executive than a prez doing 4. The only difference between the two positions is foreign policy, and it’s subjective depending on the president whether they actually learn anything from the experience. Given Trump’s abysmal governing record and inability to accomplish his agenda, he appears to have gained little experience.",[deleted],2024-08-01T16:09:21,1
