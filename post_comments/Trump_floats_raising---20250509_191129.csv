The top 10% own 70% of the wealth. So that means Republicans are trying to fund the government off 30% of the remaining wealth. Then on top of that they want to cut the entitlements everyone pays for.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-09T19:19:54,14

"This happened in France right before the French Revolution - the King wanted to be popular and gave tax breaks, but he wanted to wage war against British - and defend France from the rest of Europe - so he taxed the every-living-shit out of the low/middle classesâ€¦and after a while they just couldnâ€™t take it anymore, overthrew the King, cut off the head of Maria Antoinette, and started a Revolution.  Just a bit of history.",animalslover4569,2025-05-09T19:26:22,11

"That's not what happened (well Louis fucking the finances with funding the American Revolutionary War is on point)  King wanted to raise taxes on the nobility, but the nobility refused. Even though that was literally the *only* way out of the crisis. The nobles simply believed it was their divine right to not be taxed, no matter how much the king and his finance ministers pleaded for it to happen. The lack of action compounded because the taxes *had* to fall on the poor. Louis XVI literally had a mental breakdown because of how stubborn the nobility was being. If anything they cut off their heads because they tried to flee France and failed.   The nobility though, especially the conservative nobility, they just ran the moment the people started getting rowdy, unless they were so severely out of touch or had too many assets in France. They also held up the early years of the revolution, and *that's* when people really got fed up. Came comin' 'round the Mountain then...",Yuli-Ban,2025-05-09T22:15:52,6

"Fun fact:  'Trickle down economics' was once called the 'horse and sparrow theory.' The idea was that you overfeed the horses (the rich) with a large quantity of oats, so that when it passes through their digestive tracts, it leaves a lot of oats in their shit for the sparrows (everyone else) to eat.  Yep, the concept they cling to came from the metaphor of poor people eating out of rich people's shit.",DownwardSpirals,2025-05-09T20:08:52,6

"It took them decades to figure out how sell tax cuts for the rich to the American people.  But, high inflation of the 70s and a cocktail napkin drawing got them there.  It worked so well that they got the American people to vote for the highest peace time tax increase in American history on themselves just so the rich could get their taxes cut more.",Purify5,2025-05-09T22:22:07,1
