Economic realities are pointing to higher not lower interest rates. Trump knows that too and is afraid that Fed will maintain or even increase rates. They tend not to act under political pressure.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-22T13:54:17,7
"But Trump doesn't care about that. All he cares about is short-term economic relief to mitigate the pain he is causing with his unnecessary tariffs regardless of the long-term effect. If Trump is allowed to replace the fed chair, he will effectively be the fed chair, because anyone that doesn't agree with what he says or do what he says he sees as disloyal.
