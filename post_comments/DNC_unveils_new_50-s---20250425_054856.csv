"While it sounds nice, and I've said for years that the Dems should have always kept Howard Dean's 50 State Strategy, I will remain hesitantly optimistic. While the infusion of cash sounds nice, it is lacking in detail in how those funds are actually gonna be spent. Hiring some full-time staff? Renting brick and mortar space that nobody's going to utilize outside of a few weeks of GOTV efforts? This should either be a gamechanger or a nothingburger, that's how much the details actually matter here.  For example, it would be nice to see a House district-by-district-level chart of where the DNC had just abandoned any hopes of competing, and are now going to put in some actual party resources.",pierre_x10,2025-04-25T06:44:31,42

And it blew up their faces and we all watched it happen. After Hillary lost, Dean tossed his name back in the running for DNC head in 2016, but it was clear the established Dems had no clue what was happening. It's taken Harris losing and Trump's dismantling of everything fir the DNC to figure out how fucked they are and that Dean was right all along.

"> Embrace the “radicals” is what they need to do.  No. All of our elections favor the right, and the behavior of conservatives also facilitates the GOP's ability to move further right. Dems have to do the opposite.   Gerrymandering, the EC, and the 2 per state rule in the Senate all give rural conservatives a huge advantage. So republicans can afford to skew towards right extremism while still winning about half the elections. Dems can't because they have to gain extra votes from the center just to tie.   And conservatives always toe the party line no matter how extreme the candidate is. Dem voters are educated and picky - they'll only support candidates who make sense to them and won't go for anyone they think is nutty. Conservatives vote like it's a job - they never miss an election, whether they like the (R) candidate or not. But the left is mostly young and is very loud online but will barely even show up to vote in presidential elections. Young people are just the flakiest demographic there is, so you can't rely on them. And the left is just far outnumbered in the US.   Unfortunately, Dems have to cater to the center. What they do need is to run a candidate who is exciting and has tons of personal appeal (aka the opposite of Hillary). Biden was seen as the foil to trump, a cautious and respectable guy who is the opposite of extreme. So he did really well against trump, but he was boring to listen to and his presidency seemed boring because he just did his job instead of acting like an entertainer. And so he failed to keep people's interest. Harris didn't have the personality or the time to get it back (plus they got unfairly blamed for inflation).   Dems do need a cult of personality to run. But one who makes sense politically and with a platform that will steal fence sitters from the republican. So I want a ""Chad centrist"" who is overall close to center but with some policies that are far left. Like someone who supports universal healthcare but is tough on the border.

Unions have been functionally outlawed so long that you need a decent political education to even understand what they are. Maybe once every 4 years, some coastal bureaucrat stands in front of a factory for some photos, then we won't see any more Dems until the next presidential. Hillary didn't even do that.  The presidential election is responsible for nearly 100% of Dem messaging & branding in place like this--and a lot of the country works like this.
