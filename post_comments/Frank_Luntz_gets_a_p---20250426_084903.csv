"I’m sorry, jump ship where? Into the lava? I may not support everything Trump does, but I support literally nothing the left wants. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-26T09:22:58,142
This is how the left has lost the plot: 1) shout down or run away from every opposing opinion while wrapping oneself in holy robes of self-righteousness; 2) self-isolate in echo chambers of people who think like you so you never have to hear anything that you don't like; 3) wake up in November to the fact that 1/2 the country disagrees with you on nearly every fundamental of governance; 4) shout louder that the other 1/2 the country is just stupid; 5) get violent and go crazy because the world doesn't agree with you. It's so bizarre; a bit like watching an ant farm of self-absorbed automatons who are quite unable to cope in a world where other-minded people exist. Twilight zone material.,intrigue-bliss4331,2025-04-26T12:41:57,21
"Well no shit Sherlock!  Did MSNBC tell you we were unhappy?  And you believed them?  Crazy. On a completely unrelated note, I have a bridge I'm looking to sell...",FartingTacos,2025-04-26T09:09:22,59
The market is down 6% this year. In 2022 at this point the market was down 13%. And then it slid another 12.    So if it gets 4x worse then it will be as bad as one of Bidens years when *not a single story was written* about Dems leaving because of this shit.    I hope tons of these morons dumped their shares at bottom because they're emotional instead of logical.,rasputin777,2025-04-26T14:48:51,13
Liberal-minded people can't fathom the conservative mind-set.,triggernaut,2025-04-26T09:45:50,15
"Pretty simple explanation: things haven't changed in the real world. People are paying the same for groceries as they were a few months ago. This is no different than before the election when Democrats were trying to use the markets to convince everyone the economy was amazing.   The average person doesn't have any investments, they only care about the cost of living and so far that's looking better under Trump.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-26T11:41:07,7

"We had years of Biden’s lies telling us how great inflation was.  I’m okay with this, because I’m okay with what the end goal is.  Stronger US jobs, fair trade, and as a result stronger national security.",j3remy2007,2025-04-26T09:41:08,9
"Tariffs are literally the least important item on my list.  I love what Trump is doing on immigration, foreign policy, etc.",cofcof420,2025-04-26T09:16:07,9
"We have to be patient with the liberals, this is the first time they've ever pretended to care about the market.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-26T09:27:32,7
Frank seems to be always on the wrong side of the issues! Maybe that is why Fox doesn’t use him much anymore!,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T09:53:43,4
Used to have a lot of respect for Luntz until the last couple of years when he became a jackass.,DreadPirateGriswold,2025-04-26T20:33:31,1
He might be shocked too when he finds out the Kamala voters who felt betrayed by the ds support Trump now,Zealousideal-Dig8210,2025-04-26T10:49:23,1

"I think another reason, most Trump supporters are not as affected/invested into the stock market as the democratic, liberal, billionaire class.",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-26T10:06:35,-1
I bet these responses melted the glue under Luntz's toupee.,martel197,2025-04-26T10:51:47,-1
"Social platforms matter more than the economy right now. Who cares about 401ks when there are bigger issues to talk about like mass migration, crime, and gender ideology?  We used to emphasize stuff like the price of bread as being ""kitchen table issues"" which are thought of by voters daily, but we're in a 24/7 news environment. We have the internet in our pockets now. You can't escape hearing about the culture war any more than you can escape the price of gas and bread.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-26T12:44:48,-2
"That's the funny thing. The stock market could go down by 80% and it wouldn't change the fact that the left wants to ruin everything America stands for.  I definitely wouldn't be happy if that happened, but I'm still not voting for a Democrat.",therin_88,2025-04-26T09:37:33,33
It’s not like the average American is deep in the market. They are so out of touch. Main Street doesn’t care about Wallstreet,whicky1978,2025-04-26T19:00:38,3
"Everything the left """"knows"""" about the right comes from watching TV opinion panels, ***without looking at or listening to the actual right.***",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-26T09:19:22,27
They try to convince people that the “angry town halls” are full of unhappy Trump voters regretting their vote.,Trondkjo,2025-04-26T11:46:23,7
Doing all the things Republicans (and Democrats!) have promised for decades!,j3remy2007,2025-04-26T09:42:08,8
"They did during Obama too, when the recession hit. At least they pretended to.",ITrCool,2025-04-26T09:29:01,-3
"Realistically, the lefts solution for recovering the market would be to print money. I would rather have a stock market at 20% then to have my money be able to buy 20% of what I could a year ago.   This doesn’t excuse the right when they do it as well. That’s why government in general needs to stop worrying about the market and focus on their jobs instead. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-26T09:53:44,28
"And there isn't a single leftist counter-argument against conservativism. Every supposed counter-argument is actually a strawman. The left only argues against what they want to *think* conservatives believe, not what they actually believe.",Vektor0,2025-04-28T10:03:20,2
This is why I like watching Peter Samtinello on YouTube. He represents what actual journalism is. Going TO THE ACTUAL PEOPLE AND LOCATION and getting their opinions and input on local conditions.  Not sitting in some studio in a distant city somewhere on a cushy couch or chair and making assumptions while duking it out with political panels.,ITrCool,2025-04-26T09:27:00,4
Well...they didn't in 2022 when Joe caused a 25% loss.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-26T09:34:06,8
Exactly. They’re selective hypocrites.,ITrCool,2025-04-26T09:54:08,0
