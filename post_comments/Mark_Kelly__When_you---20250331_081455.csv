"Absolutely right, Mark Kelly for president!",[deleted],2025-03-31T08:51:17,26
Trump never has cared about the working man. If only the working man knew it we wouldn't have this problem. And also thank Merrick Garland as well.,Amazing_Bluejay9322,2025-03-31T08:55:47,16
"Any combo of Kelly, walz and , pritzker would make a fantastic POTUS and VPOTUS",King_krympling,2025-03-31T12:28:49,11
"""Most"" is a strong word. *Barely* most Americans care about car prices.  The rest - which make no mistake, is a *lot* of Americans - voted for Trump.",CarpeNivem,2025-03-31T11:26:43,3
He has to take the limousine because the other guy always has AF1,Actual-Reference3125,2025-03-31T12:57:04,4
He is turning the heat on. I like the spicy zip from someone like Kelly,foodie_geek,2025-03-31T17:41:55,2
I can’t wait to see the results of the elections tomorrow. Going to tell us a lot about 2026.,perilous_times,2025-03-31T17:51:01,2
"I was set to buy a new car this year but have changed my mind. My current car is a 2021 and will last me several more years, I can wait this bullshit out. I know I'm not alone. New auto dealers have to be shitting their pants right now over this, their year in sales is going to be REALLY bad.",BloopityBlue,2025-03-31T14:57:34,1
"He is the guy to right the ship, 100%. He will get conservative votes, no question.",Boxinggandhi,2025-03-31T11:21:24,12
"Agreed but, I’m saying this as a 65-year-old woman, there are some great younger people that could step up to the plate too.     Pete Buttigieg and Jon Ossoff two names that come to mind.   Jasmine Crockett and AOC are two others destined for higher things.",bde959,2025-03-31T14:20:29,6
"the reason maga supporters don't care is because *generally*, for most, a new car is out of their reach financially... so this is another way they think they're sticking it to the libs.",BloopityBlue,2025-03-31T14:58:45,1
"Oh I fully agree, problem is the GOP has hate as a fundamental, so as much as I would love to have jasmine Crockett or AOC as VP or POTUS they likely wouldn't win because the GOP couldn't stand the thought of having a woman in charge unfortunately",King_krympling,2025-03-31T14:22:42,6
Ossoff for president,Existing-Ad3391,2025-04-06T05:12:47,2
"Sadly, you are right about women rising to offices they are capable of filling.    It’s another obstacle that you have to jump over when you could just worry about it being the right man.",bde959,2025-03-31T14:26:40,2
I could see them being cabinet members but until something drastically changes the GOP won't let a woman be POTUS especially not a woman of color,King_krympling,2025-03-31T14:29:47,3
That’s what I just said.,bde959,2025-03-31T15:42:09,0
This is something I would be proud to be wrong on if they did win,King_krympling,2025-03-31T15:46:58,2
