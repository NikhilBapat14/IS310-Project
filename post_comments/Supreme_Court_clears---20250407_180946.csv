"It doesn't make any sense, because it basically removed their due process right.   They don't get due process here, they literally just get rounded up to a plane.   They also didn't get due process in El Salvador, as they are simply going straight to the jail.      So we literally sending people to jail without due process. The gov said they are all illegal immigrants, but without due process and official documents, who can tell who they are and what have they done?",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T18:39:57,1

"They literally ruled ""they"" get due process, just not in DC. They must get notice before deportation and have to file in Texas. It's not really a win for Trump.",jetmech09,2025-04-07T18:57:11,1
">The American Civil Liberties Union’s Lee Gelernt, who was counsel of record at the Supreme Court for the plaintiffs who brought the case, emphasized the due process aspect of the ruling. “The critical point of this ruling is that the Supreme Court said individuals must be given due process to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is an important victory,” he said.  They obviously should have shot down the usage of the Alien Enemies Act, which is what the dissent was mostly about. They instead chose to rule that while he can deport under the Alien Enemies Act, the accused must go through due process first in the state they were convicted and cannot be removed from the US until then. It’s generally a good thing, just not what actually needs to happen: stopping the Alien Enemies Act being used this way.",CommodoreAxis,2025-04-07T20:12:04,1

"That's why I say this is a huge win for this admin, because they would stretch it as far as they can and want.   And also what about for the people that already been deported to the prison? Seems they would not be bought back since the deadline is paused.   And I think is a huge win because it literally allowed the president to invoke the wartime act, which means we are at war right now. The president can significantly expand his power and insurrection act would be next.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-07T20:30:24,1

[how about PBS?](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-constitutional-rights-do-undocumented-immigrants-have) - It literally states in the article that illegal immigrants have very little to no rights. And that due process isn't one of them.    [or u.s. constitution.net?](https://www.usconstitution.net/constitutional-rights-non-citizens/) - Talks about a supreme court decision on Visa denial and has very little to do with what I commented.
