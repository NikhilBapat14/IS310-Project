"As a parent, I'm confident materials produced by this program helped ensure my child was at a lower risk for SIDS. We always did ""back to bed"" (baby sleeping on their back), used sleep sacks instead of blankets, and had a motion monitor like Angel Care under the crib mattress. We were well aware of the risk of SIDS and that awareness kept us alert and informed.  This is just absolutely craven; truly sick stuff.",interwebz_2021,2025-05-01T00:19:17,17

Are you kidding me? They want more babies but are cool with them dying in their sleep? But apparently the studied disparities in deaths from SIDS probably excite these racist clowns,greyhoundbrain,2025-05-01T05:17:17,3
"Well, supply and demand. There will be fewer toys, I hear, so demand needs to be reduced as well. That's how you keep inflation in check and reduce deficits. Also known as austerity.",Just-Sale-7015,2025-05-01T01:18:01,2
