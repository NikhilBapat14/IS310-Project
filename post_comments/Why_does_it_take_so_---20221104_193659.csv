">Surely it defeats the purpose waiting to hold them the same day as the general election just to fill the seat for two months?  The 17th amendment to the Constitution (passed 1912) says:  >When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.  So the Constitution says vacancies in the Senate are filled by the ""executive"" (AKA governor) until the state holds elections. Elections are very expensive, so it would cost tens of millions (if not hundreds of millions) of dollars to hold an election just for one seat. So most states just wait until the next planned election to vote for that vacancy. So for your examples on Senators:  **Kamala Harris** was up for re-election in 2022. The governor of California chose Alex Padilla to serve the remainder of her term (January 2021- January 2023) and let the people vote in the next general election.  **John McCain** was elected in 2016. He died in August 2018. Due to how close this was to the general election in November 2018, The governor appointed Jon Kyl to the seat to fill until the next reasonable general election in November 2020. Jon Kyl resigned in December 2018, so Martha McSally was appointed to replace her until the general election of 2020, where she lost to Mark Kelly who will serve through 2022 when John McCain's seat originally expired.  Now for the House of Representatives, the Constitution says replacement MUST be elected, so nobody can appoint temporary replacements. So it's really up to the state to determine whether they want to spend the money/time to hold a special election for 1 seat, or wait for the next general election. In this case, Florida decided to hold the primaries for the seat with the general election in 2021, then the general election 2 months later in January.",ProLifePanda,2022-11-08T09:37:45,1
