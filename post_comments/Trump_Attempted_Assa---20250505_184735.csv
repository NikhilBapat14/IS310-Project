"These past few years really have been so hectic that it’s easy to forget that we almost had an assassination of a former president and, at the time, the potential next president that was mere millimeters away from being a successful assassination.   One has to wonder just how the world would be different if the assassin was successful. Love Trump or hate Trump. He has certainly had a major impact on the way that things run not just in the U.S but across the world.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-05T19:19:25,229
As they should! Those epic stills will go down in history - regardless of your politics!,Tellmeg,2025-05-05T20:39:39,44
this is going to sound belittling but as soon as trump survived the assassination attempt my group chat with the based boys was blowing up because we all knew he just won the election then and there.   we truly are living in the best timeline.,PatTheBatsFatNutsack,2025-05-05T21:57:21,61
That image with Trump's fist in the air against the clear blue sky with the American flag flying as blood streams down the side of his head.  The perfect image to encapsulate the American spirit.,____IIIII___ll__I,2025-05-05T23:43:07,53
The latest dem cope is that he wasn’t shot at all lmao,SovietSteve,2025-05-06T04:06:58,32
"I remember it was late at night in europe, was going to bed and I open reddit, all my feed was ""Trump got shot"" and I sprung out of bed and hopped on X right away.",Chikaze,2025-05-06T08:50:15,3
"Just think, there’s people on TikTok and Reddit RIGHT NOW that are “joking” that someone should try it again.",strong_grey_hero,2025-05-06T12:59:43,2
"Those three weeks between the June Debate and the assassination attempt were some of the most dramatic I’ve ever witnessed during an election year.   To have all of that come after Covid/quarantine/riots/the gradual returning to “normalcy,” and on a personal note a very frightening family emergency in May/June of 2024 (they’re fine now), those three weeks were not what I had expected at all. I usually try to stay out of election year drama, but those three weeks made us turn on the news more than we had in a long time.",According_To_Me,2025-05-06T07:28:15,14

Thank God he lived. ,kaytin911,2025-05-06T01:42:55,30
Same here.  Maybe we're on the same group chat.,Papa_Ganda,2025-05-06T06:38:37,8
First it was a Trump supporter shot him and missed on purpose! 😂 Anybody that knows anything about shooting knows that's an impossible shot with what that kid was using. He put that dot on his head and pulled. MOA is a mother...,Schwanntacular,2025-05-06T05:28:38,24
"I don't think ""President Harris"" would have happened as Biden would likely not have dropped out. TBH, I don't even know if the nation would have made it to the next election intact.",According-Activity87,2025-05-05T20:21:55,85
or 3. Vance manages to avoid any major blunders and the Electoral map looks the same as it does in our timeline.,LKincheloe,2025-05-05T22:02:34,18

We'd really have been royally screwed if he'd died,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-08T22:27:16,1
Creating a situation of total chaos would unironically be Dems' best bet for holding onto power. It's also been their go-to trick since the mid '10s.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-05T20:59:32,47
Vance wasn't picked at the time (unless he was unofficially picked)  The GOP would have to have an open convention if trump was assassinated that day,blaze92x45,2025-05-06T07:52:25,14
