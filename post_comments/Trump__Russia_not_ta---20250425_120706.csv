So not invading a country is now a concession? Trump really out here negotiating for Putin.,Euphoric-Bed7379,2025-04-25T12:11:33,18
">“Stopping the war, stopping from taking the whole country, pretty big concession,” Trump responded.   Excuse me?",brobafett1980,2025-04-25T12:11:52,11
"Trump is a tactless, undiplomatic bully who thinks he can muscle his way to get things done.  Hasn't worked very well so far.  Was he simply thinking he would get Ukraine to surrender?  Was that the solution to the conflict?  What a buffoon.",Smithy2232,2025-04-25T12:14:43,4
Ukraine doesn’t even get a security guarantee in this deal so they’d literally be in the exact same place as when Russia took Crimea in 2014 except even worse and we saw how that went. Like with this deal you’d guarantee another invasion within a decade once Russia has had time to recoup,Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-25T13:27:01,3

Just turn it around on him. Ukraine not taking over Russia is an even bigger concession,No_Anxiety285,2025-04-25T12:53:40,2
That's the response we are expecting from a Vassal of Russia.,thieh,2025-04-25T12:24:47,3
"In Trump's peace agreement: Russia entered this war with a huge amount of sanctions and 3 unrecognized occupied regions, and will leave this war with fewer sanctions, recognition of the annexation of Crimea, and 4 new regions. Maybe I'm stupid, but such a treaty would only encourage Russia to invade again.",Top_Mechanic237,2025-04-25T14:50:39,3
Trump is getting a great deal.  He doesn't care about anything else.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-25T19:52:27,1
