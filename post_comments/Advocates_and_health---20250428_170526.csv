That's the Republican goal.,Richfor3,2025-04-28T17:06:29,48
 Just a regular ass dude here and I also worry because when you eliminate something which exists to stop people from dying that's literally the expected outcome.,Elmer_Whip,2025-04-28T17:08:54,9

">The Trump administration is once again putting [LGBTQ](http://advocate.com/lgbt)\+ lives at risk — this time by proposing to gut federal support for the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s [LGBTQ](https://www.pride.com/lgbtq/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks)\+ Youth Specialized Services.  >“For countless LGBTQ+ individuals, the crisis line isn’t just a service — it’s a lifeline,” [Karine Jean-Pierre](https://www.advocate.com/politics/karine-jean-pierre-exit-interview), former White House press secretary and longtime champion of LGBTQ+ rights, told *The Advocate*. “It’s what stands between despair and survival, isolation and hope.”     And that's what Republicans want. They would rather have dead kids than queer kids.     Republicans have made it clear that they want to execute genocide against LGBTQIA+ people. They delight in seeing queer kids die.",southpawFA,2025-04-28T17:07:15,9
Alternate headline: Conservatives are thrilled that Trump's suicide prevention hotline cuts will increase LGBTQ+ youth deaths.,SerialBitBanger,2025-04-28T18:25:23,3
Are people ready to call this genocide yet? We all know the goal of removing this service from the lgbtq community.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-28T17:33:23,5
Their goal is reached.,trashmenowokay,2025-04-28T18:32:21,2

"The headline almost makes it sound like this isn’t exactly what they want. As far as MAGA is concerned, the more dead LGBQT people, the better.  Just one of many reasons why MAGA does, in fact, equal NAZI.",foxinHI,2025-04-28T17:41:13,2
Republicans will loudly cheer any death that they believe is on “the other side” of them. They’re brainless toadies and bootlickers.,Iainfixie,2025-04-28T18:56:03,1
By design.,ReinaShae,2025-04-28T19:00:56,1

"Yes, that is the point. This is intentional mass murder. It should legally be considered treason, among other things.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-04-29T02:19:21,1
It's the point,Early_Gold,2025-04-28T17:27:24,0
Yup. Republicans would rather have dead kids than queer kids. Truly genocidal group.,southpawFA,2025-04-28T17:11:53,20
Exactly what I was going to say. That's what they want.,hinanska0211,2025-04-28T17:07:24,16
"That's really concerning. LGBTQ+ youth need support, not cuts. Hopefully, this decision can be reversed.",Embarrassed-Arm-2363,2025-04-28T17:11:24,6
"No, because that's not a genocide. It's a vile decision, that's for sure. Calling it a genocide is disrespectful of people who were really victims of genocide, and makes the word meaningless.",Same_Performance_595,2025-04-28T19:29:48,-2
"Only till that bun comes out of the oven, then it’s every baby for themself. They can lift themselves up by their bootie-straps.",foxinHI,2025-04-28T17:44:15,3
"They really just like dead kids, I think, as a baseline. Between refusing to look at causes for school shootings, repealing food & drug safety regulations, OSHA & child labor laws, attacking public health, vaccines, free lunches, WIC, SNAP, and so, much more, it’s hard to see anything else, but it’s no doubt they’re far more gleeful if it’s dead *queer* kids.",BrujaSloth,2025-04-28T17:25:27,7
"Go read what genocide is, this is not disrespectful. You dismissing this attempt to kill off children of a vulnerable minority is what is disrespectful.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-28T19:37:59,2
I know what it is. It's not a genocide. You should read the definition.,Same_Performance_595,2025-04-28T20:08:51,-1
"So this isn't  deliberately inflicting on a group conditions of life calculated to to bring about its physical destruction through whole or in part?   Like say demonizing parts of the lgbtq community as rapists, murderers and deviants who want to harm you. Then taking away their human rights and legalizing the discrimination against them to create harsh mental torment. Then to take away life saving resources meant to prevent physical harm from coming to vulnerable groups?  Go back and read what genocide is. Actually go read it. It is alot more than just sending us to camps to be gased and cremated. We were some of the first targets in the holocaust, we were some of the last to be freed from the prisons decades after the war. Do not tell me what is or isn't genocide. People like me have suffered countless genocides that other people try to undercut and say is bad but not genocide.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-28T20:16:55,1
"No, you are entirely wrong, hyperbolic and dramatic. Cancelling a suicide hotline is a bad policy and decision for the health of the LGBTQ people, based on prejudice, but it's not a genocide, by any means. It's not a systematic threat, either, as most of them aren't actively suicidal.  The systematic deportation of 2 million Armenians to the Syrian desert, where there were left to die, is a genocide. The systematic killing of nearly a million Tutsis by Hutus in Rwanda is a genocide. The rounding of Jews and their extermination in gas chambers by Nazis is a genocide. Cancelling a suicide hotline isn't, even remotely.",Same_Performance_595,2025-04-28T22:33:05,1
"Cool, its not just canceling a phone line. There has been a decades long campaign against the lgbtq community that has demonized them to generations and caused insurmountable damage to millions. Taking away health care, hot lines and basic civil rights from a group is genocide. There is more than just this and you know it. Stop down playing the genocide against the lgbtq community. It doesnt have to get to gas chambers to be a problem, or a genocide.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-28T22:51:30,2
"As a queer person myself…no. What is happening is horrible and wrong, but you won’t be taken seriously with this rhetoric anout genocide.",sasheenka,2025-04-29T02:11:13,1
