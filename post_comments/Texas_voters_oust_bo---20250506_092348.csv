Good deal. Texas is a lot more purple than people give it credit for. Now if we can just get rid of Paxton and Abbott,StormFireX001,2025-05-06T10:10:02,64
It’s getting ridiculous.  There is a general lack of intelligence in communities now.  I can’t wait for this children to grow up and take over.  Their parents suck at governing.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-06T09:46:50,30

Some heroes are going to need to stand up in each state and publish something like The Book-Loving Texan’s guides. It’s incredibly difficult for voters to figure out if a normal-presenting school board candidate is actually a book-banning Christian nationalist.  Here’s what he’s produced over the past few years:  **The Book-Loving Texan’s Guide to School Board Elections** * [May 2025](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jaG-Ivrc4DtP1tP94hHKUE4eni-lFi-ym_9xZfRv9Fo/) * [November 2024](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wg7OQEWScuQjN391NnW2K7sRBH9785AvjXZvaCjQjDw/) * [May 2024](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13VseX7-AeDOQmTBRUReZJ7idJ-HsTAeqnDxMmYE-y30/) * [November 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GT-n9SDn000ndeD4dQi0W-_Z5eSwHxIccoXclNFoReU/) * [May 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYWeqdcJEa10JgKPG3KSOjvJzKI-bvD_Ar34n-Iac5k/) * [November 2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c_-n95PrNoYqswOwyNDb-GABF1lrK3Z64gqVw2VBnO8/) * [May 2022](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V7wwMmcdGmCubMXk4BDRj9z4sEnuGj-Dq03efz0m4aE/),Arrmadillo,2025-05-06T23:11:22,4
"Texas is not a battleground state yet but we’re working on it. Our big blue counties keep getting bluer while our tiny red counties keep getting redder. We probably have more democrats in Texas than most other states have voters.  It doesn’t help that we had a pair of Christian nationalist West Texas billionaires take over the state GOP.

But behind the scenes, the West Texas oilman is lavishly financing what he regards as a holy war against public education, renewable energy, and non-Christians.”  “Dunn is up-front about his desire to use politics to pave the way for a ‘New Earth,’ in which Jesus Christ and his believers will live together.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-06T23:22:31,2
