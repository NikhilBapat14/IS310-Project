"No. California Social Services offers voter registration assistance to individuals with disabilities, but they must be citizens of the United States. In order to register to vote in California, you must confirm that you are a citizen of the United States. Voting by non-citizens is not a problem that US elections have, save for a few isolated instances where something went wrong. It is hard enough for many citizens to vote as it is.     Anyone telling your aunt that non-citizens are being registered and voting in elections is attempting to use latent xenophobia to frighten your aunt into lending political support to a nationalist candidate.",[deleted],2023-03-04T17:23:58,7
"The federal voter registration form is an inanimate piece of paper, so it can't ask questions in any state.",unebaguette,2023-03-03T22:03:28,3
"In California, when you apply for a drivers license or state I.D. card, if you are a citizen, there is an option on the form that you can check to use the information you have provided to register you to vote. That's the closest thing I can think of what your aunt is saying. I don't know if you have ever applied for a drivers license bit it is not an easy, automatic, or ""no questions asked"" process.",loselyconscious,2023-03-05T04:04:13,1

"What's a ""federal voter registration form?"" All voter registration is done at the state/county level, right?",ArchdukeAlex8,2023-03-03T23:24:14,2
"I used to live in California, Iâ€™m familiar! But I think sheâ€™s under the impression thereâ€™s a social services specifically for people illegally crossing the border granting them voter rights.   I know. ðŸ« ",LivingNo7641,2023-03-05T09:23:51,1
"Just google CA voter registration and try and do it online. Literally the first thing they ask is if you're a citizen. It's not even a ""I called them 10 years ago"" kind of thing. Just go try and do it with her.",mormagils,2023-03-06T09:12:30,3
"There is a federal voter registration form that every state is required to accept.   It is designed by the federal government but gets sent to the state agency that runs elections.  That form is available online and can be submitted by mail.    So every state has had a ""no questions asked"" method of voter registration for decades.   [The National Mail Voter Registration Form](https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voter-registration/nvra/laws-standards/nvra-manual/chap-7)  >The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) required the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to design a national mail voter registration form (National Form), in consultation with state elections officials. The NVRA also required states to accept voter registrations submitted by mail using the National Form.   >In 1994, the FEC created the National Form after consulting with state and county elections officials, social service agencies, and advocacy groups. Since each state has its own voter registration requirements and forms, the FEC took into consideration the various paper sizes, voter information, and voter registration database technologies used in the states in designing the National Form.    >The National Form can be printed from the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) website atÂ www.eac.gov. The Secretary of State and county elections offices can make available paper copies of the National Form upon request.   >**The National Form may be used to register to vote in any state. The form includes general instructions as well as state-specific instructions on how to complete the form. Since the United States has no national or federal voter registration system, completed forms are sent to the appropriate county elections office and are processed in the same manner as the state VRC.**",unebaguette,2023-03-04T01:45:59,5
"She may be confusing services provided by nonprofits, some of whom recieve government funding, who may also serve illegal immigrants, with services provided by the state, local or federal governments.  Catholic Charities, for example, does serve a lot of undocumented individuals, usually in immigration-related issues, but also other ones like counseling and the like.  Generally most states make it illegal for the government to do such things.  However, such organizations don't have the power to accept voter registration applications.  Also, there is the issue that in California, like in most states, the voter registration form requires you to have a driver license, state-issued ID, or Social Security Number. While in theory an illegal immigrant could try to register with a fake ID number, not even the CA SoS would just take their word for it.",IRVCath,2023-03-20T16:41:57,1
"Even then, they still require some form of ID either at the registration process, or on election day.",IRVCath,2023-03-20T16:44:19,1
