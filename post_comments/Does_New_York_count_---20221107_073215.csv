"Many, I would say most, states count mail in ballots before the election but keep results internally only releasing them at the same time the other results are made public. Processing mail in ballots takes more time so it's prudent to not wait till polls close if you want timely results.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-11-07T15:14:14,6
"I wouldn't say it's accurate that NY gov is likely to be a nail biter. Hochul hasn't completely run away with the race as many expected her to, but she's far from in a very threatened position. Hochul has consistently had a 5-10 point lead in polls. Only one poll has given Zeldin any advantage at all.  NY is usually pretty quick to call, in part because they do a lot of early voting and haven't really had MAGA schenanigans so much and in part because the races aren't usually close. If Hochul performs about as well as the polls expect, I'd say you'll know who's going to be governor before the night is over.  HOWEVER, HUGE DISCLAIMER: these midterms might be REALLY weird, for too many reasons to list, and I wouldn't be surprised if the traditional guys who call elections are a bit more hesitant than usual. So take it with a major grain of salt. It's probably best just to expect results when we get them.",mormagils,2022-11-08T09:23:23,2
"The odds are better than even that in more than a few major races we won't know the winner for a few days.  Georgia Governors race for instance between Kemp (R) and Abrams(D) is probably going to have to go to a recount at the very least. So that one will be more like a week before a winner is declared.    Then we'll have to deal with all the ""Well there is no way that a Republican could lose in this state, so it MUST be rigged."" crowd.  But we will deal with that (again) when we get to that bridge.

"Actually, quite a few state ban the counting of mail in ballots until the polls close.",LiberalAspergers,2022-11-07T16:18:47,12
New York is actually an in between case.   Ballots can be processed and set up for scan starting the day before early voting opens. (Verification starts earlier and actually needs to be done within four days of receipt).   But actual counting canâ€™t start until an hour before polls close on Election Day - though no results can be released publicly until after polls close.,PhiloPhocion,2022-11-07T16:58:38,8
