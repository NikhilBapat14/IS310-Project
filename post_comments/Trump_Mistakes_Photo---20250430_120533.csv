"Even without the letters 'translating' the tattoos, the idea is ridiculous. Why would gang members have rebus puzzle tattoos showing their membership?  Experts like Sean Kennedy, former federal prosecutor in California have called this out. ‚ÄúWithin MS-13 culture, such markings would likely be frowned upon and even viewed as a sign of cowardice, as they could be interpreted as an attempt to hide or downplay gang affiliation. That type of concealment goes against the gang‚Äôs norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.‚Äù  You can find pics of actual MS-13 members with extensive tattoos. They just flat out have MS-13 tattooed prominently.",travio,2025-04-30T12:25:47,36

He straight up said he could do what SCOTUS ruled but is refusing. No ‚Äúhe‚Äôs under El Salvadoran jurisdiction,‚Äù but ‚ÄúI could get him back but I won‚Äôt‚Äù  4) the President of the United States said it is not his decision to return Kilmar Garcia.

"Oh no, I certainly do not.  He is clearly a threat but not because he is some mastermind fascist dictator, but because he is an idiot completely out of his depth, cannot recognize it, refuses to consider it, and is surrounded by yes men with evil agendas who will tell him whatever he wants to hear to enact them.  Oh I also think he is just a nasty, cruel, terrible person, on top of being a complete idiot.",MagicianHeavy001,2025-04-30T12:52:08,22

I agree. He just reacts to what his advisors say or show him and he‚Äôs easily manipulated if he likes you. That‚Äôs why all the elites couldn‚Äôt wait to be near him during inauguration. If you have his ear you potentially have his behavior,Curious-Look6042,2025-04-30T19:21:24,1
