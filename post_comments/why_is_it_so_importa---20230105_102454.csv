"A North Korea collapse would lead to a major humanitarian and security crisis, as not only would China have to deal with a massive refugee crisis but would have to worry about what will happen to the numerous WMDs North Korea has.  Preventing a total collapse is one of the few things all countries in the region agree on.",Naliamegod,2023-01-11T23:53:00,3
"Client states are often more useful than direct subsidy states.  An independent North Korea means that North Korea's problems are *North Korea's* problems. Once China steps in as the sugar daddy, they now have to deal with a lot of the problems.  There's also no real *need* for an explicitly China friendly government is in place in North Korea. What are their other options? North Korea needs China and they're both well aware of that fact. Why spend resources trying to solidify something that's already pretty clear? It's not like North Korea is going to do a heel turn if spurned by China and suddenly try to cozy up to the US.   Russia isn't really in a position to be FWB right now and it's not really clear that Russia has a lot of B to bring to the table to begin with.   Having North Korea as a sort of ""deniable asset"" is more valuable to China than having them be a client state. If there were a meaningful risk of North Korea shifting to be more US/Western friendly, that dynamic would probably change but given the situation in North Korea, the chances of that are not worth discussing seriously.",HeloRising,2023-01-09T02:18:23,1
