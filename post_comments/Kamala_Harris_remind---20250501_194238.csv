Have democrats realized what Primaries are for yet.,Whole-Essay640,2025-05-02T04:45:04,85
"If Dems want to keep losing, keep pushing her. She’s never won a primary, let alone a general election.   Harris = Vance/other win in 2028.",DS_9,2025-05-02T05:32:28,71
I thank God every day that  people had enough sense not to elect this individual.,Resident_Maybe_6869,2025-05-02T07:07:23,38
I have no idea how someone as stupid as her was running for presidency. Insane.,kelvarnsen1603,2025-05-01T20:34:42,313
Unburdened by what has been,Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-01T21:22:31,64
Thank God she is not our president. We dodged a MAJOR bullet and it must not be squandered.,yespleasethanku,2025-05-01T20:34:35,86
She most certainly did. I hope she gets out more,Siciliantony1,2025-05-01T20:04:23,68

The laughing hyena speaks.,JohnnyHekking,2025-05-01T20:37:37,33
"We literally dodged a bullet. I can't think of a worse candidate for President (or any in office for that matter) in U.S. history! Total cackling, incompetent, word salad wannabe politician that embarrasses even the weak and ignorant left. We are finally UNBURDENED BY WHAT HAS BEEN!!",Sufficient_Article_1,2025-05-01T20:56:39,23
The level of tone deafness as to why they lost the election never ceases to amaze me.,garcon-du-soleille,2025-05-02T08:54:53,2
Like we really needed a reminder!,xobeme,2025-05-01T20:25:28,2
Yup,skarface6,2025-05-01T21:05:37,2
I can’t wait till she runs in 2028 just to lose to JD,Rubentraj,2025-05-08T06:12:15,1
"No one voted for her in the democratic primaries before Joe was forced onto us. And then they picked her as Joe’s sidekick. And then Joe had a mental meltdown on live television, so because she was Joe’s sidekick, she was forced onto us, and then all of a sudden people thought she would be a good president after they had already decided she wasn’t a good choice. And they wonder why Trump had such a dominant victory.",mikechm,2025-05-01T20:46:31,217
"She got steamrolled in the primaries, literally nobody wanted her to run. I still can’t believe they ran Kamala Harris…",GreatApe88,2025-05-01T20:54:45,87
That was their best. Think about that,juanjose83,2025-05-01T20:37:12,90
And liberals believe she’s super smart and JDV is not intelligent.,sWo97,2025-05-01T21:00:29,81
Have you seen her voters... that's how,Visible_Knowledge811,2025-05-01T20:40:03,31
I just had an argument with someone the other day. They said she is intelligent!!!,marksman81991,2025-05-02T04:48:17,8

Liberal logic.,kelvarnsen1603,2025-05-01T21:01:38,50
"Cause he fucked a couch, as if most of the liberal base hasn't done something worse.  *Should have worded this a bit differently, I don't care if he did or didn't as far as I know he didn't. This was me being a sarcastic ass and playing the liberal side.*",Katzchen12,2025-05-01T21:45:41,-20
That's insane...I think she's actually a little on the slow side and truly think she has a below average IQ.,SingleStak9,2025-05-08T00:18:25,2
Me when I lie,Ripamon,2025-05-02T00:37:10,15
"He didn’t. He never did, and the prevalence that that lie has is insane. Someone tweeted “I bet no one realized the JD Vance admitted to fucking a couch on page ____ of his book,” and it just took off from there.",halfhere,2025-05-01T22:22:05,31
