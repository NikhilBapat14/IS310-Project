"While Putin puts on military parades, European leaders are on the ground in Kyiv, standing in solidarity with President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people. That's a stark contrast between authoritarian posturing and genuine democratic support.",4ngelicajellybean,2025-05-10T04:53:10,8
"Quote: The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for talks in Kyiv on Saturday in a show of unity a day after Russia's Vladimir Putin hosted his allies at a Victory Day parade in Red Square. The summit will discuss a U.S. and European proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in the Russian war in Ukraine that if refused by Moscow would see them jointly impose new sanctions, a French diplomatic source said, adding that the step had not been finalised.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-10T04:32:59,3

June 14.  Worst part is a military parade had been originally planned for years to celebrate the Army’s 250th birthday that falls on the same day.    Trump usurped it & turned it into a good old Soviet Missile Parade to celebrate himself.,Abydos_NOLA,2025-05-10T07:16:54,3
