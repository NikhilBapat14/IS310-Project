The difficulty with corporations is that legally they are only responsible to themselves. There is no defined benefit to society from any particular corporation other than the vague appreciation that capitalism must be good for us.,Crowmakeswing,2025-05-02T14:24:42,61
"If we stay within the constraints of the system, I think it's best to align investor goals with employee goals by creating an incentive to invest long term over short term. Short term goals are why everything has gotten so shitty",xsdf,2025-05-02T14:36:51,5
"There's nothing inherently bad about a corporation, it's just a matter of how an economy manages them.  With a proactive government that works for the interest of the people, corporations can be made to operate in a manner that is both efficient at delivering the products and services people want, while also protecting their workers, consumers and the environment.  That's unlikely to happen when we have a system that requires presidential candidates to raise a billion dollars to be considered a serious candidate while allowing corporations and billionaires to contribute unlimited amounts to candidates.",Searching4Buddha,2025-05-02T14:29:20,21
"In the United States, CEO pay. There's this well-known phenomenon where CEO pay skews upwards overtime, because boards feel that they have to offer a new CEO hire above average comp, even though the comp is ludicrous to begin with, and thus skewing the average even higher over the time. The net result is that CEO comp is now wildly out of balance with that of the average company employee. This is a huge factor in the terrible reputations of a lot of companies we all know and hate.",eggoed,2025-05-02T14:25:10,7

"I think private equity is the issue   We should change some rules; when a company goes public all the shares or a very large percentage should be required to be made public, not 5% so the seller maintains control and does what they want with no regard for shareholders  Private equity shouldn’t be allowed to exist - this thing where accredited investors can conspire and conjure up deals in dark pools is absurd.  Our corporate laws need to change, this “LLC is an entity” silliness - it opens the door to fraud and abuse. We have to tighten this up and make people who own business accountable to operate like a business and not some unknown shell company   I think if you clean up who can go public, tighten up LLC (including all the other entities used to hide) and just flat out ban private equity from existence- people will know where the buck stops  When someone is accountable you can trust again",RCA2CE,2025-05-02T14:48:25,3

"Well by making all corporations worker-owned rather than shareholder-owned. The primary issue with modern corporations is the legal discrepancy wherein they must maximize quarterly profit for a small group of wealthy people often at the expense of their workers, their product, the environment, and even long-term growth.  The inherently undemocratic decision making of corporations is why they have a terrible reputation. The German solution of board elections is an interesting way to incorporate some amount of democracy into the system, I'd like to see legislation like it in America.",Theamazingquinn,2025-05-02T14:46:33,0
"> Germany has the interesting system where if you employ more than 500 people, then they elect a third of the board, and for more than 2000 employees, they elect half of them. The chair is appointed by mutual consent, or if they fail, by arbitration. You could also plausibly give employees (and shareholders too) the right to see the tapes of their meetings. What else might you come up with from an institutional perspective?  To be clear, this is *bad*.  It strongly implies that hired help have similar, if not identical, stake and risk in a company.  They do not.  To answer your question, the hatred toward corporations is an education issue, based less on objectivity and more on emotion.  People hate corporations in part because they're told they're bad and evil, but the reality is a lot more complicated at worst. Much of the overall wealth and economic growth that we've experienced is due to corporations, and hating them for doing what they do well isn't logical.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-05-02T15:49:12,-1

A large problem is that very large companies really are not investing in their country or people. They will usually use the money to increase their own wealth rather than paying their employees good wages or investing in their talent.

But the employees have a right to be present, to have a voice, express concerns in a coherent way with a group of people elected by employees not for the purposes of being like a trade union for issues like pay and hours, but on how the company works in general, and can force the shareholders to unite among themselves and be certain they want to do something if they want to do something risky or which can have adverse effects on employees.

Though I didn’t work for them, I knew people who did and loved working there. No parade was needed. They were a blue chip stock back in the day. There was a time when all you had to say to a bank was “I work at Kodak” and you got approved for a house loan. Kodak made the mistake of not realizing they were in the image making, not the film making industry and paid dearly for it.   I could say the same for Polaroid and GE, both of whom were giants and are now shadows of their former selves. Those who worked there loved those companies. People who bought their products did as well.  I currently work for a large corporation that went through a rough patch due to incompetent management. I enjoyed the company and what it offered to consumers; the management? Not so much. Fortunately, they’re gone.  Same could be said for that great old restaurant chain, Howard Johnson. Those who worked there loved it as well as those who ate there. ",baxterstate,2025-05-04T11:55:04,1

"People promoting employee ownership want all of the upside, none of the downside.  We have an industry that is entirely employee owned already, and that's law firms. Not every employee is an owner, but every owner is an employee. (This is a legal requirement, as non-lawyers cannot be owners.)  Equity partners have to buy their stake when they're promoted, often taking out large amounts of debt to do so. And their compensation becomes tied to profits. That's a situation a ton of employees would not like to be in.  And at present, every employee of any publicly traded company is able to be an owner. Just buy shares in the company. Figure out what percentage you think you ought to own as an employee, and buy it.  For instance, if you work at Chipotle, they have 130,000 employees and a market cap of $69.5 billion. So, if you think everyone should get an equal share, just pony up $530,000 when you take your job.  Of course that doesn't work, but also an equal share for a new employee is silly. Let's say average person works 45 years in their life, so maybe we divide that by 45 for a new employee. That's $11,900.

">compensating everyone at the level they deserve   We have over a century of science and sociology explaining why you are wrong.  80 percent of the planet is not poor (living on less than 10 dollars a day, 45ish percent living on less than 1.75) because they ""lack marketable skills"". Rather, they lack marketable skills because capitalism artificially makes them poor, inherently cannot provide full employment, and inherently cannot provide more than poverty wages for the global majority.   Indeed, even if everyone were magically equally educated and talented, the sheer fact that 80 percent of jobs on the planet offer extreme poverty wages, would mean that, like a game of musical chairs, over two thirds of all human beings would be (regardless of their actions) forced against their will to suffer the knock-on effects of poverty. Anyone who escaped this fate, would push another down.  More crucially, under capitalism, the value or purchasing power of your dollar is dependent on the global majority having none, lest inflationary pressures kick in (if 80 percent of the planet were not poor, the dollar in your pocket would be worthless; ie structural inequality and violence is baked into money itself).  And as aggregate debts inherently outpace aggregate dollars in circulation, at any point in time - especially as rates of return on capital outpace growth, and as most growth flows toward those with a monopoly on land and credit, and as velocity is never high enough - all profit tends to push another human being elsewhere in the system toward debt and so poverty.  So far from ""compensating everyone at a level they deserve"", the system constantly engages in violence which in turn sorts or pressures people into classes. And regardless of one's position in these classes, every monetary transaction tends to have a negative knock-on effect on someone else in the system, pushing them down against their will. And you know this intuitively; just play a Monopoly boardgame and see what happens.",Wetness_Pensive,2025-05-02T20:32:46,0

"The profit is the harm. It's productive capacity that's lost to society and hoarded out of the economy as wealth.  Profit does not motivate people to benefit others, it motivates them to create systems to siphon productive capacity away from society. The hoarded capacity that has been siphoned off can then fund systems of hierarchy to force people (through corporate propaganda and state violence) to continue feeding the siphon.  I notice you're able to explain a situation (roads) where central planning is better than market competition. But what's a situation where market competition is better? We are often told markets are more efficient, but they're more efficient at creating profit (that is, lost productive capacity), not at providing services.   For example, a city bus system stopped developing an app in-house that would track all their buses. Instead, they contracted the work to a private company who promised to build the app more efficiently. As soon as the system was in place, the private company decided the app would no longer be free for users. Benefit to society lost.  I don't even disagree with you entirely. We do need individuals to respond to opportunities faster than a central state bureaucracy can do. There is a better way than markets to do that: basic human collective instinct. Most of us will go out of our way to help someone in need. When we don't, it's because we're afraid of the opportunity cost: we'll be late for work and fired, or we'll get bamboozled into a long-term situation caring for someone with long-term needs. Outside of markets, the community could collectively provide for all needs, so if you end up taking care of one problem, the rest of us will take care of yours until we're all good.   It's hard to say how the arc of history might have changed without the invention of profit. It seems like it's a difficult phase-- like puberty-- that we had to go through. But starting from now, when we see the harm profit is doing through pollution etc, it might be an existential need to find a better system going forward.",dude_chillin_park,2025-05-02T23:16:16,1

So assuming the 165k employees making 250k per year, the CEO now only has 20 billion left over.

"I would argue that their love for money isn't what makes them unacceptable.  Smaller companies and workers also are ""in it for themselves""and are generally accepted.     I would blame the switch from ""a company must focus on profitably for the company"" into ""a company must focus on the benefit of the stockholders"" which is based on actual court cases,  starting from Ford vs Dodge.   In the past,  corporations do have to focus on profits but can think more long term or abstract. The legendary example of paying workers more so that they buy the cars they made.  Short term pain for long term success was a valid option.   Focusing on stockholders, especially once dividends stopped being a primary tool of compensation puts the stock price as the ultimate tool of success.  As people in the gaming sphere understand:  set a reward and people will maximize the gains to the detriment of their own happiness.     Thus now you have companies that gut themselves since the result of the damage won't show for years.  By then the stockholders would have sold the inflated stock and the CEO walks away with a golden parachute. Meanwhile the company is ruined and the workers, customers,  and many others,  suffer the consequences.     We now are at the point where a company doesn't need profits or a successful plan.  All they need is enough hype to get people to invest and buy in.  Companies will layoff their workers in quarter 4 to have better numbers for shareholders then hire new people in when they aren't looking.  Successful trusted companies hollow themselves out and collect the gains before everyone notices and the sandcastle falls.     Combine this with the allowance of so few companies owning entire industries going through the above and you have a lot of reasons to stop trusting them.      How to fix?  The true answer would be stockholders moving back to blue chip dividend reliance so that companies are hyped over how long they can last rather than how big they can make you dream they can get in 3 months.  I don't think you can legislate that and solutions that require societal change aren't reliable.    So I'd say focus on breaking down the monopolies and ""monopoly in all but name"" until companies become too afraid to swallow up everything around them.  More relaxation over the above ruling though that may not change much. A lot of the change will come from new companies pushing the old to do better or die.    Oh and unless someone has a really good reason to leave this in. Put a big hammer on levraged buyouts.  We lost a lot of otherwise healthy companies to groups who bought them by making them shoot their own foot them profiting off the dying embers. ",According_Ad540,2025-05-04T01:56:13,2

The hoarded capacity that has been siphoned off can then fund systems of hierarchy to force people (through corporate propaganda and state violence) to continue feeding the siphon.  This just fundamentally isn't true. This is only true if you think all wealth and productivity is zero sum, which is absolutely not true and frankly a harmful perspective. Your reasoning is exactly the same reasoning that encourages expansionist wars and exactly the same reasoning Trump is using for his bullshit tariffs. Profit does not ""steal"" from anywhere.   People can profit by stealing from or defrauding others, but that is not where the *vast* majority of profit comes from.   >For example, a city bus system stopped developing an app in-house that would track all their buses. Instead, they contracted the work to a private company who promised to build the app more efficiently. As soon as the system was in place, the private company decided the app would no longer be free for users. Benefit to society lost.  Except the city bus system could just decide to develop the app in-house again if that company produced a product they don't like. Or they could purchase a different app from a different company. Plus having an app that isn't free is still better than having no app at all, that is still a benefit to society. I'm not sure where you get this idea of having to pay for stuff is bad?? You now have more freedom to choose to take the bus than you had before.  Do you mine the earth for metal and then fashion it into your microwave or do you go to the store to buy one? Would it be better if everyone had a free microwave? Sure, but there is no such thing as a free lunch, so it is better if there are microwaves you have to pay for than nobody even having the option of buying it.   >When we don't, it's because we're afraid of the opportunity cost: we'll be late for work and fired, or we'll get bamboozled into a long-term situation caring for someone with long-term needs.

I don't think you understand or appreciate just how important trade was in the history of mankind. Trade necessarily involves profit on both sides. When I buy a banana for $1, I value the banana necessarily more than $1 and the store values the banana necessarily less than $1. I receive the value of the banana minus $1 in profit and the store receives $1 minus the cost of the banana. That is profit. If I would get less value from the banana than $1, then I am just not going to buy it. If the store would get less money than the cost of the banana, then they aren't going to sell it.   The whole reason we have writing systems and mathematics was developed to facilitate trade between strangers. It allowed the formation of large and complex societies beyond the number of people that our human brains can keep track of. This can only happen because of trade. Because of profit.
