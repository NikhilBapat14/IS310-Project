"This is probably my second favorite outcome of this past election cycle, next to Mark Robinson having to go back to work at a pizza place.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-05T19:47:57,80
"The ruling said the court’s order is stayed for seven days, during which Griffin has one more opportunity to file an appeal.  Not sure why AP left that out.",jlaine,2025-05-05T21:32:59,14
"And it needs to be ""certified"" until the party of illegality and corruption wins. Right?",bytemage,2025-05-05T19:49:32,-30
Wait did that really happen?,Old_Skud,2025-05-05T21:45:14,12
Did you read the article? It’s in there:  > But the judge delayed his order for seven days in case Griffin wants to appeal the ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.,rogue203,2025-05-06T02:25:19,11
What? It means that the judge is telling the GOP to cut the shit and move on.,propman54,2025-05-05T20:44:34,48
That’s the first bit of content covered by the “read more” button so maybe they stopped early.  I know some sites (AP not being close to the worst) put so many ads and image breaks between sections that I can’t tell where the real end is.,PuffPuffFayeFaye,2025-05-06T07:11:20,2

"Wow, it’s impressive how some people just can’t seem to keep up with current events. 😏 But hey, at least the judge made the right call here. We need to ensure that democracy is upheld, especially when it comes to elections.   It's about time more folks recognize the importance of certifying results, especially when they're leaning toward the right side of history. Can't say the same for the Republicans, who'd probably prefer a system where they can just declare themselves winners. But, you know, that's just how they roll. 🙄",Otherwise_Dot4091,2025-05-06T08:25:44,1
