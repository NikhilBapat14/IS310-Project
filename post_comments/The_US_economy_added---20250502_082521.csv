"Until it's revised down like last month.  228,000 to 185,000 in march    >The US economy added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April, a slight slowdown from March’s downwardly revised 185,000 gains, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. April’s gain was stronger than the average pace of monthly job growth in the prior three months.

"You won’t see the laid off Federal employees until the Fall because they are technically on payroll. The report would be negative if they were added.   Keep in mind companies ramped up the hiring because they were confident that the economy would be strong. The tariffs have changed that. UPS is laying off 20,000.   If the Economy was Biden’s then this might be his final Jobs Report but the jobs market is not good and people are aware of that. These are backwards looking numbers and they often get adjusted.",Morepastor,2025-05-02T09:18:28,5

This is good perspective. Also it's one of those stats that needs further context. How many people also lost jobs? Are these actually new jobs or positions that are now open? Probably a mix of both because we should have serious labor shortages if a quarter million new jobs are being created every month.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T09:23:33,1

"They lied ? The United Parcel Service (UPS) is expected to cut about 20,000 jobs in 2025 as a part of a larger plan to reduce costs and increase profit, citing “changes in the global trade policy and new or increased tariffs”.  The company cited “current macro-economic uncertainty” as preventing it from providing any updates to its previously issued forecasts for revenue and full-year outlook.  Here is your part of the filing “The report also said UPS planned to expand on its consolidations of facilities and workforce as well as implement an “end-to-end process redesign” resulting from anticipated “lower volumes” from the company’s largest customer, Amazon”  It’s gonna not be okay but it’s what you voted for.  “CEO Tomé said that the need for adaptability and efficiency had been heightened by the administration's trade policies.”",Morepastor,2025-05-02T10:08:29,2
