"In their minds, Obama and Biden were unbearable, they even referred to it as the “Biden regime.” They lost it over vaccine mandates (which, somehow, they compared to the Holocaust because of vaccine cards), and then came Biden’s so-called “Ministry of Truth.” Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t agree with all of it either. I always believed the vaccine should be a personal choice, though I understood why some places imposed mandates, it’s not like that was a new concept. I am in the military and I am required to get a yearly flu shot and got a battery of vaccines during basic. It is what I signed up for.   The difference is, when Biden was challenged, he backed off. He didn’t double down, flip the country the bird, and claim the Constitution was just a piece of paper. What we’re seeing now feels dangerously close to North Korea-level absurdity, where even criticizing Dear Leader is enough to make you “disappear.”",Excellent_Pirate8224,2025-04-15T10:49:39,3

"If Trump decides to use military force -something I believe he wants but hasn’t yet found the opportunity for -his plan may be to let the situation deteriorate to the point where mass protests erupt even in MAGA strongholds. Then he could declare martial law. But if it comes to that, it won’t just be Harvard’s problem - it will be a global crisis. Regimes like that can’t survive without launching victorious wars.  As for your hope that the military is still loyal to the Constitution - it might not matter. The main striking force wouldn’t be the military anyway, but groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and Three Percenters. It’s similar to how it worked in Nazi Germany: it wasn’t the Wehrmacht that brought Hitler to power, but the brownshirts (Sturmabteilung, or SA). And once they had served their purpose, they were wiped out by the SS (Schutzstaffel), a paramilitary group directly under Hitler’s control.",QuarterObvious,2025-04-15T17:28:02,2
