"I didn't realize there were any questions left, we saw what he was in the first term. He's a complete fuckup, and only keeps getting jobs because he's loyal to Trump.",RealGianath,2025-05-08T14:24:22,33
"***From Rolling Stone’s Ryan Bort:***  FBI Director Kash Patel left senators dumbfounded during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing on Thursday, practically scoffing at the idea that he has to deliver a budget request in a timely manner, while throwing up his hands about any responsibility the FBI might have in holding Donald Trump’s administration to account for denying due process to immigrants.  Read: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/kash-patel-spars-dems-fbi-budget-due-process-1235334720/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/kash-patel-spars-dems-fbi-budget-due-process-1235334720/)",rollingstone,2025-05-08T14:32:21,19
"After reading this, I went to the Conservative sub to see if it was being discussed.  One of the top posts includes this story:  [https://www.foxnews.com/us/kash-patel-warns-fbi-mission-risk-under-trump-admins-massive-fbi-budget-cut](https://www.foxnews.com/us/kash-patel-warns-fbi-mission-risk-under-trump-admins-massive-fbi-budget-cut)  It's Fox News, but it includes quotes, and is a radically different account of the substance of the meeting.  Basically says Patel is arguing for considerably more money than Congress has already approved.  ""If we continue on the current trajectory outlined, we will have to not only eliminate 1,100 vacancies currently at the FBI,"" Patel said. ""I will have to fire 1,300 more. In order to fight crime at a level that is consistent with 2025, the budgetary number I've asked for in my paperwork is, I think, reasonable.""  Both these stories can't be true.",KennyDROmega,2025-05-08T14:34:52,16

"He did not have a budget. I'll admit it is a little confusing but earlier in the hearing, I believe Senator Coons talked about the budget number you are referencing:  ""I believe you testified yesterday that you would request $11.1 billion.""  The problem is he did not bring an actual budget request and gave no timeline for the submission of the request. The bigger hiccup is Trump's budget is considering a MASSIVE cut to the FBI and Patel is arguing that that cut would be an issue, which is why he's talking about the trajectory. But his numbers are estimates, because he's not submitted a formal budget request.",Traditional-Level-96,2025-05-08T14:57:04,9
His wording implies that crime is up in 2025. It's not.    The head of the FBI can't keep himself from lying about crime statistics to Congress. ,Raxnor,2025-05-08T19:07:18,4
This is the most egregious and malicious misinformation. imo context is the most important part of reporting the news. It's no wonder their viewers are in an alternate reality.,laptopAccount2,2025-05-08T22:30:19,1

Thank you for this.  100% something the Fox News story should've mentioned.  RS also could've gone quite a bit more in depth on the meeting itself.  Feels like they basically quit after they got their headline moment.  Feel like this is unfortunately reflective of media as a whole at this moment.,KennyDROmega,2025-05-09T17:51:37,1
