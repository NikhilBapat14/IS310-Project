"That's good, but its not gonna go anywhere until we can get some of these GOP clowns to pull their heads ouf of Trump's ass.",Torracattos,2025-04-28T15:06:23,47
"Good luck! But if GOP weasels won't vote to save Medicare, they certainly won't vote to impeach.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-28T14:14:27,33
"I love to see this. Hoping the best, would like to see the criminal removed.",spoogiedshark,2025-04-28T15:01:25,28
"Now is the time more than ever to CALL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES. Flood their phones with calls to impeach, convict, remove. Using 5calls makes it easier",MidnightTrain7,2025-04-28T15:36:19,16
"Good, but it ain't going anywhere. Don't get your hopes up.",Mynuszero,2025-04-28T14:42:52,9
Real question. Could Dems just keep doing this over and over again even if each one doesn’t pass? Is there a limit to how many times you can move to impeach?,SFGal28,2025-04-28T15:51:11,7
"If trump has dirt on members of Congress and is using that to control them, why can't we dig up the same dirt and use it against them? In other words, if we already know the dirt, trump can't use it against them and/or we can use it to get them thrown out of congress.",TheRealBlueJade,2025-04-28T17:36:02,2

Which of the hundreds of high crimes and misdemeanors did they pick?,Sea_Actuary_2084,2025-04-28T16:52:48,3
We really don’t want JD Vance as president or Mike Johnson that would be more hellish,bapeach-,2025-04-28T15:57:42,3
Too soon! This is totally necessary but too soon. Impeachment is a political process. Trump has been impeached twice and it's accomplished jack shit. Trump's approval must be in the 30s for there to be any chance of impeachment to accomplish something.  It's not enough to be right. You need to be effective as well.,MrYdobon,2025-04-28T16:02:56,2

This should be a slam dunk. Sadly it won’t be.,SadPhase2589,2025-04-28T17:20:38,1

Bout damn time. I’ll just assume that they needed time to get their ducks in a row to make a respectable run at it.,JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-28T18:31:05,1
Let’s go!!,Lazy-Street779,2025-04-28T18:47:55,1
"Too little, too late. The damage is already done. And impeachment only makes Vance President. It would cut back on the chaos, sure, but the Project 2025 agenda would only accelerate. Trump goes along, but only really cares about himself. Vance is a True Believer.",MK5,2025-04-28T15:19:06,-1
"Just watched Jessica Denson cover this. They only need 19 people to flip from the last time to make this happen. Nineteen! It isn't impossible.   https://www.youtube.com/live/O5CbPODGAeo  Let our politicians know we want this and we support it.   Impeach, convict, remove.",LastConcern_24_7,2025-04-29T07:22:17,2
We must resist anyway. Otherwise it's just surrender.,Ghitor,2025-04-28T17:32:55,17
Yup that’s what they are a bunch of weasels who love the chaos he’s causing. What’s different from a sadist? Because it sure isn’t helping anyone.,mlineras,2025-04-28T16:03:36,2

Excellent question.  Makes you wonder if that's just the scare tactic - the only dirt is what the individual perceived it to be.,Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-29T07:55:57,1
"If Trump goes, the rest of MAGA goes with him. MAGA would tear itself apart when Trump leaves office, either by impeachment or when he sooner or later keels over and ends up in a pine box. They wouldn't be able to agree on who to follow next, and then turn on each other.      Vance wouldn't have anywhere near the support Trump does, nor would Mike Johnson, and it only lessens from there. Vance would either have to toe the line or be very easily removed from office, and the same for anyone would could follow him. Trump is the only real obstacle, once he falls however that comes about the rest collapses like a house of cards.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T16:42:26,7
"this is wishful thinking, but Democrats could take over the House and Senate at the midterms. Then they could impeach Shady Vance and raise holy hell on his VP.",hairless_resonder,2025-04-28T16:15:58,5
"I agree, too soon. Things have to get a lot worse so Republicans will be on board.",MetalMamaRocks,2025-04-28T17:40:57,3
"No. The Democratic party needs to push impeachment among other measures nonstop. If they wait until Trump lacks the popularity to continue it's going to be far harder. They need to push bills, they need to push impeachments, they need to keep hitting him left and right. Showing that they are trying is what will bring about the support they need to get an actual impeachment through.  The fact that the Democratic party had the ability to do something and sat on their asses instead is why Trump even had the possibility of running in 2024, not to mention winning. The Democratic party should have played hardball instead of waiting for that ""perfect opportunity""... that never came.   The wise do not wait for opportunities, they make them.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T16:47:54,2
