"And just like every other bit of ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù hypocrisy we see in them and call out, this won‚Äôt matter to them. Conservatives are immune to hypocrisy because they have no consistent moral, ideological, or policy platform. They‚Äôre willing to pivot to whatever is convenient and whatever will do the most damage currently, and then laugh when we point out the hypocrisy. It fuels them. This only ends when we stop pretending they are a serious good-faith political party adhering to norms and start treating them like Nazis, confederates, criminals, etc.",VP_of_Lasers,2025-05-03T06:17:16,102

She has told me before that she thought both candidates in all the elections since the 2016 one. The candidates on both sides were bad candidates, but that in 2016 and 2020. She thought the Democrat candidates were the lesser of two evils in those elections. She has told me plenty of times she hates Trump as a person, yet she seems to think that just because he was President before, that he was more qualified for the position than Kamala. Now yes that's an incredible dumb statement. But I can only hope that the next pair of candidates in the 2028 election(whoever they may be). She'll have seen that Trump has not done a good job whatsoever and probably won't vote Republican in the next election. Then again who knows. My grandmother is very much like a stereotypical conservative old woman, but I do think she does show more empathy towards others than your average conservative old lady",Pixel22104,2025-05-03T13:13:31,1
