"PACs solicit donors in almost the same way as candidates do. They have fundraisers, send texts and emails, send mail, and of course make phone calls (called 'dialing for dollars' in the industry). These tactics are the same for small and large donors alike.  For how they decide WHO to target, it's a little more difficult. They can do donor list swaps with friendly organizations, they can do cold contacts to voters whose profiles match their target supporters, or run ads online. Over the years they build their own lists of faithful donors to resolicit.  Most PAC money comes from a small handful of wealthy donors, who their fundraisers or directors know from past experience, or who are prolific in the industry.",CaitlinHuxley,2022-09-01T07:10:18,2
