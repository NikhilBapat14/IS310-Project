"This is a very surprising pick. Prevost was not really a top contender to most people, and the fact that he is an American is a huge part in this too. Typically the Church has tried to stay away from American Popes because of how much power the US already has in the world. This is a pretty big shake up.   As far as politics, I don't think either side will be happy lol. While Prevost is a Moderate and not everything is known about him, he's generally considered not *quite* as progressive as Francis was. Conservatives will likely dislike his general view points, but the fact that he is an American at the end of the day is a win for American Catholics who typically lean Conservative.",Curze98,2025-05-08T12:34:31,1

"How is it a win for conservatives? I feel like most leaders in the church are conservative and Prevost seems to lean more towards Pope Francis values being picked by Francis himself. If anything this would upset catholic conservatives in America much more as Prevost will probably continue to advocate for immigrants like Francis did. It‚Äôs kind of a shot at traditional American Catholics.   Truth is the Catholic Church sadly will probably never elect a fully progressive pope at least for decades to come, it‚Äôs just not gonna happen. So someone that‚Äôs stemming further from their traditional ways like Prevost can still be a good thing, he‚Äôs no Francis but it‚Äôs kinda close enough it feels like.",Imaginary_Job972,2025-05-08T13:09:41,1

He is *not* a MAGA Republican, but if you were to try to equate his views to US politics, he would probably considered himself a more classic Republican.  It is a win for Conservatives because again, he is a Republican voter and he is from the US.

"Yeah, Trump here is a posterchild for rising cruelty, fascism, and Anti-christ... as in, he represents everything Christ warned us to avoid - not as in he's the literal anti-christ.   Though holy shit he fits the bill of that evangelical nonsense to a spooky degree, so much so that the evangelicals are goose-stepping right behind him - just as their Christian fanfiction said would happen.   Evangelicals just thought it would be actual Christians and not their Temu-Church knock-off that broke bad for Satan.  Basically, the notion here isn't that US interjects itself into evrything as if we're the center of the universe (we do, and its gross):  Rather, Trump is emboldening fascist political movements worldwide because he showed it can happen in the self-proclaimed cradle of democracy.  He won the US presidency a second time and suddenly Evangelicals have joined the Neo Nazis in believing Empathy is a sin.  So it's very possible his shitty little AI-slop pope-meme really did contribute to a choice that rejects the enshittification of Christian dogma.  Again, not to say we Americans aren't self-aggrandizing pricks. Just that in this case I'm willing to entertain that the Catholic Church went Mean Girls on Trump's saggy orange ass.

"Umm, from the NYT article on 5/2:  Whereas Francis said, ‚ÄúWho am I to judge?‚Äù when asked about gay clerics, Cardinal Prevost has expressed less welcoming views to L.G.B.T.Q. people.  In a 2012 address to bishops, he lamented that Western news media and popular culture fostered ‚Äúsympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel.‚Äù He cited the ‚Äúhomosexual lifestyle‚Äù and ‚Äúalternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children.‚Äù  As bishop in Chiclayo, a city in northwestern Peru, he opposed a government plan to add teachings on gender in schools. ‚ÄúThe promotion of gender ideology is confusing, because it seeks to create genders that don‚Äôt exist,‚Äù he told local news media.  While praised in Peru for supporting Venezuelan immigrants and  visiting far-flung communities, the cardinal has drawn criticism over his dealings with priests accused of sexual abuse.  One woman in Chiclayo who said she and two other women were sexually abused by two priests as girls long before Cardinal Prevost was bishop accused him of mishandling an investigation and of not stopping one of the priests from celebrating Mass.  The diocese of Chiclayo said Cardinal Prevost opened an investigation that the Vatican closed. After a new bishop arrived, the investigation was reopened. Supporters of Cardinal Prevost say he is the target of a smear campaign by members of a Peruvian-based Catholic movement that Francis disbanded.  In Chicago, activists say his office did not warn  a nearby Catholic school that a priest who church leaders determined had abused young boys for years was sheltered in a monastery nearby starting in 2000. As head of the Midwestern order of Augustinians at the time, Cardinal Prevost would have approved the priest‚Äôs move to the monastery.  Attempts to reach Cardinal Prevost for this article were not successful.",twistedt,2025-05-08T13:09:15,1
