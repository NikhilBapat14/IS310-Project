"Note that Carney will play point regarding policy on behalf of Canada, and provincial premiers won't have much leeway except to try to keep trade smooth to the extent they can, and to set proper expectations with each other because their citizens will feel it the most.      But maybe the governors will agree to report to Canada any massing of armed forced in their state that is unusual, or a fed-invoked activation of each state's national guard. You know, things that can affect national interests - like Canadian sovereignty, and any (new) American constitutional crises.   Of course, they will also talk about new trade frameworks in a post-Trump (and post-Trumpian) world.",steve_ample,2025-05-05T14:43:24,10

"Something we need to see more often. Partnered states should be working together to counter the corruption coming from the federal government. When trump cuts education or healthcare funding in Maine, partner states should step in with assistance. When trump cuts a federal agency, partnered states should hire the federal employees and create a task force with a similar mission serving the partner states. Keep that expertise in business.  Obviously, secession is not an option. Making international trade deals isn't either. Yet every bit of redundancy the states can build into parallel operations weakens the ability of trump to put pressure on individual states by withholding federal funds/services.",DJ_Majesto,2025-05-05T20:20:48,1

Hey look on the bright side; it’ll be cheaper for you to rent a house on the cost this year with Canadians not spending their vacations in Maine and New Hampshire. Lobster rolls might come down from 35$ this year too!,thewolf9,2025-05-06T05:20:41,1
