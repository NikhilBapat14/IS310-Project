Didn't they just make a whole anti-Christian bias EO? One that allows them to pray at work.   This guy is just practicing his religion as stated is now okay in the EO that Trump signed.   Christians are such woke little hypocrite snowflakes.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-30T10:28:29,2

"They frame it as “Christian bias” but what it really means is anything that signals you’re against White Christian Nationalism which is a political movement with Christian signs and symbols.  But it’s not the Christianity you’d find teachings for in the Bible. You don’t see this lot “welcoming the stranger” “loving neighbor as self” or turning over money tables  Instead it’s a movement that centers its belief around a European looking Jesus who uplifts not the poor but the white, and power not compassion are outputs of this “faith”",PastorNTraining,2025-04-30T10:18:21,4
