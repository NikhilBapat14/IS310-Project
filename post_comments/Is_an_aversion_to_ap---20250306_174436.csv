"I would agree.   I work at a major fortune 500 and NO ONE talks politics.   At all.   Now, if you're close to a colleague you can sus out their leanings, but, it is super moderated. No one wants to risk a professional breach by being openly partisan for fear that an opinion may be taken personal.  At my former job at a small company during Trumps first election in 2016 - different story. We actually had somewhat passionate office debates.  But that was a small private company and much less formal.",neosituation_unknown,2025-03-06T20:49:00,171
I think that’s an accurate observation that extends beyond professionals as well- many spaces have a significant social sigma associated with engaging political discourse. Historically that’s been an appropriate way to keep organizations focused and inclusive - but perhaps it’s now an obstacle to organizing and meeting this moment,TechnicalV,2025-03-06T20:10:13,116
">For a certain type of professional society it’s become crass over the years to be super partisan and almost marks you as trashy in a way.  From a pure business perspective, most people/companies donate both ways because the business has to survive under any administration. To do that you want doors open enough that there is someone to take your call, and to be certain you're invited to important functions.  This week Trump announced destructive tariffs, and the CEOs of the big three auto manufacturers were able to talk Trump off a ledge. If they'd been openly hostile to Trump that wouldn't have been possible.  The reverse question is more important to businesses, *""how would it benefit the business, by extension an execs career, to be publicly hostile to the government of the day""*.  It wouldn't.",epsilona01,2025-03-07T00:09:37,21
"I think this actually makes a lot of sense. Hyper polarization makes it harder for people to call out bullshit. Not every country has as much trouble talking about politics. In countries where there are many different options, people probably feel like discussing politics is more worthwhile because there are more places for their energy to go. And you don’t risk having to bundle as many different beliefs into red versus blue.",blzrlzr,2025-03-06T20:18:45,33

"Yes, yet there are other factors involved.   Even without the partisan culture that exists today, the ""elite"" class is still unlikely to speak their true concerns. Why?   It's simple: they have power, and it is in their interests to hold onto it (and ideally increase it). There is always someone important, whether shareholders, politicians, or someone else, who could get upset with what you say. You could just select a group of people that you want to side with (partisanship is an example of this), yet what if they lose their power. In the game of power, which the ""elites"" know all too well, you want to assume formlessness, rather than picking a side.  This is ultimately the answer to the question. It doesn't matter if some people (the opposite party), don't like you, but it does if they're important. You don't want to pick a side in case it starts losing power and popularity.  Modern partisan culture is clearly problematic as it's getting far too extreme, and increasingly polarised (which will only stir conflict and restrict progress). Yet, either way, people will never say exactly what they think all the time. Often they'll even say the opposite.",the_magus73,2025-03-06T23:57:33,6

">*preventing* an entire class of people from *properly reacting* to the moment  Since we are speaking of a ""class"" of leaders and managers, we absolutely DO NOT want people who are *reactive* and easily swayed by the Zeitgeist in positions of responsibility. Who wants to work under a boss who pushes their personal politics into the workplace when you are doing a job that has nothing to do with politics? Should baking bread become a political platform? Or changing tires? Or selling jewelry?   The concept of noblesse oblige counters the idea that people in superior positions should take advantage of their station to manipulate those under their influence. It is precisely why the modern British sovereign is traditionally apolitical.   Discretion, good taste, and generosity of spirit should *prevent* managers from unduly influencing their subordinates' politics. And this should always be the case.",rouxjean,2025-03-06T23:22:51,3
"If what you mean is the same thing I'm noticing, its a cultural trend that at its core is about appearing 'non-ideological'.   In practice, you can generally stake out a set of common ideas that are being prescribed to and taboos that are avoided. But for whatever reason having these values appear to be viewed as being ""above"" other ones, via the idea of being ""between"" two poles. If you have philosophical bits of both of only two political options, then you must be able to ""see"" it all, synthesize all (two) options and not commit to one side or the other (ideology).   To me, this is just another ideology. Ironically, there was a time that a popular flavor of this was called ""Third Way Politics"". It is interesting to me that this specific label faded away and has become what (I think) you are describing.",ViennettaLurker,2025-03-07T07:41:06,3
"I think more office political conversations occur when Dems are President. The policies are questioned because everyone can have a different perspective and analyze the pros and cons of certain policies. Discussions can be had on a variety of factors that led to the policy and the potential outcomes. This does not happen under Trump. His voters are not openly questioning the pros and cons of his actions. They do not consider historical factors outside of the right wing media narrative. All right wing personalities are liars and grifters, not historians, economists, sociologists, and educated knowledgeable people. The media is driven by an established narrative. MAGA goes along with the narrative and can tell you what they heard about it, but they don't question the source, the history, or make comparisons to other political ideas outside of that media narrative. It is a cult of personality, not a political party. The room for nuanced discussion isnt there. The non-Trump voters react with disdain for his policies and his manner of speaking. This also means there is a lack of ability to have more nuanced conversation about policy. They can commiserate together, but the conversation will lack the analysis that can come from actual well thought out policy actions because the basis of these policy decisions is not at the same level as Dem presidential policy.",Matt2_ASC,2025-03-07T16:38:02,3
"To me, being partisan equates to not having an open mind and also failing to recognize how influenced your mind is by so many sources. That makes me want to shut down and not have a serious conversation with you. It's stupid and immature.  Now, why won't someone like me take action? A. I need hard proof that it's necessary because I will not trust a damn thing any established legacy democrat institution tells me just I won't with Republicans because there's a clear agenda behind it. So Reddit, MSNBC, CNN, etc fuck them. They lied and distorted facts too many times. I need 3rd party highly accredited academics who have no stake in the game and it needs to be a substantial amount. One podcaster or college professor. Na. Fuck that. It needs to genuinely feel real and I need to literally see it before I'm willing to act. So the problem is, I can't tell what's true and what isn’t or what's a true threat versus hyperbole. But I suspect it's mostly hyperbole designed to get me to act and I don't accept those practices so I refuse to let them consume me.  Second, I would need to trust the dissidents who don't support Trump. I do not, nor will I ever trust the Democrats. So if Trump was pushed out, we'd end up with them and that's actually less acceptable than Trump even if he ruins the economy. If a real movement that actively rejected both parties were able to gain traction...then I'd feel a lot more comfortable.  But right now Democrats are telling me to openly rebel against Trump and they can't give me a compelling reason as to why the fuck I should be listening to them. Sorry, but they fucked up so they can eat it.",Telkk2,2025-03-08T10:35:36,3
"Absolutely yes and there's two flavors of this - liberal and conservative. They're related but distinctly different.  Liberals are held hostage by respectability politics. Image means everything to liberals and *appearing* too partisan is to be ""too emotional"" about politics and ""too irrational."" They usually point to us on the left and say we're ""too emotional"" about our politics but trying to appear more neutral is a way of saying ""We believe what we believe because we're rational people and our opinions are rational assessments of the world."" This sort of neutrality has an assumed cache among liberals because you're not *too radical* and thus considered ""mature"" enough to be trusted with a political opinion.  Conservatives also subscribe to respectability politics but not in the same way that liberals are. They want the veneer of impartiality, they want the aesthetic of detached, rational assessment of facts - they believe what they do because they're rational people and have logically analyzed the data and come to a conclusion that is correct by virtue of that logic. I say they're interested in the *aesthetic* of impartiality because, the majority of the time, they'll be as nakedly partisan as they please but just assert that they're only that way because it's the reasonable angle to take and it *just happens* to align 100% with what they already believe.  I understand that these seem similar but they're different in the sense that liberals strive for that appearance of not being partisan to the point where they'll stake out positions that are absurd if you look at them for a minute (""we can deal with extreme racists by kindness and dialogue"") and earnestly defend them because, for them, the important part isn't the position it's that they appear to be taking a neutral tack.  On the other hand, conservatives treat it more like a Magic card in the sense that they need to play to being neutral and once they've done that they can then say whatever they want because they've previously established that they're not partisan so de facto whatever they say isn't partisan.",HeloRising,2025-03-06T21:01:24,9
"My problem is that saying:  “Our government has been captured by Russian backed corrupt oligarchs. The United States is now a rogue isolationist nation that is actively siding with Russia. We are not going to have free and fair elections in 2026.” Or any other true statement that doesn’t have smoking gun proof, it makes me sound like a crazy person.   People don’t want to believe bad things can happen in America. American exceptionalism as a political myth prevents that. So people won’t believe what these people are doing, even if there is a smoking gun.   Propaganda works and a significant portion of our population live in an alternative reality that doesn’t really exist.   The true statement that right wing media has a lot more propaganda, lies, and misinformation than left wing media doesn’t do anything. Because the people who need to understand that are the ones living in the propaganda bubble.   So if we can’t convince them that their truth is actually a web of lies and that their media is to blame, how can we convince them to stand up to the person they think is saving them?   The (sort of) good news is that once things get really bad - and we are heading that way rapidly - then people will not be able to ignore what is happening.   Unfortunately by that time, it may be too late.   I will end with another true statement that makes me sound crazy:   Trump will likely die in office, in 2 years or 10 years. He is never going to give up his power again.",sloppy_rodney,2025-03-07T08:44:18,7

"*Is an aversion to appearing too partisan preventing an entire class of people from properly reacting to the moment?*  Sort of.  One problem is that the political establishment does not know how to deal with populism. The establishment tries to appease the populists or cooperate with them, but that will invariably blow up in their faces because populists are untrustworthy and irrational.  Another related problem is that liberals tend to not understand how to deal with maximalists.  Liberals generally don't comprehend that ceding ground to or making concessions with bullies only breeds disrespect and makes things worse.  Showing any respect to a maximalist will appear to the maximalist to be a sign of weakness.  They despise weakness and will seek to exploit it.  Guys like Trump see the world as a win-lose competition in which compromise is for losers.    Any attempts to offer concessions will make them smell blood.  If the western world was smart, it would mock Trump for being a loser.  He hates the idea of being a loser.  Hearing repeatedly that he is a loser will eventually break him.",I405CA,2025-03-07T10:42:33,4

"I’m glad I discovered this sub today, because I’m grappling with this very thought. I’m a federal employee, previously dei worker. As my office was dissolving and I was waiting to be potentially fired, (I wasn’t, luckily - others not so lucky)I learned that one of my dei colleagues was a trump voter. She’s such a sweet lady, and I never knew her politics before because we just never talked about it. I know she’s a Sunday school teacher, very religious, but many of my colleagues were. We all had so much respect for each other, we never waded into those topics because we just agreed that we were entitled to differences and that the values we shared brought us together to do good work for our organization. And this was a tight-knit group. We hung out after hours together, etc., so this wasn’t someone hiding their views for fear of retaliation. And even when I learned her politics, that didn’t change my respect for her.   Poor soul - she had a paradigm shift, live, in the office. She couldn’t understand why the people she voted for would do this, why they were taking a chainsaw, vs scalpel, etc. We all talked about it, shared views, had civil discourse. Honestly, even during one of the more miserable moments of my life, I will always remember those conversations as some of the best I’ve had.   This has led me to realize exactly what OP is saying: I view it as crass to just spout my views and take sides. Being able to see both sides is probably one of the things I am most proud of about myself. I value discourse and disagreement because that’s how we fix things.   But I’m also filled with anger, disappointment, rage. My personality (and even my job as a DEI practitioner) is/was to pull people of opposing views together for productive dialogue. (Whew, let me tell you about being the person between a trans employee accusing a conservative evangelical of harassment and being the one who needs to bring them to peace and cooperation!)  So, I’m grappling with my line. When is the time to harness my anger? I have a personal side/view. I’m very, very impacted by what’s going on. I’m heartbroken, actually. Depressed, even. But I also know that conversations work better when you take no side and try to educate, be non-partisan. As a fed employee, that has been my life.  But I do also feel as though I’m not meeting the moment. I feel complacent (partially because my job is still very insecure and I need to keep my head down) but also because I am willing to swallow my anger in order to hopefully inform others. This is what liberal arts degrees and conflict management as leadership training have instilled in me. But has it also taken my voice and pulled my feet out from under me? Is now the time for rage and anger? Is polite, constructive criticism a lost cause? I think so. But I also see the shouting and rage-bait just causing further entrenchment.

"Honestly, it's not something that ive considered before and I would agree it's an interesting point. Personally ive just stayed in the middle because I do believe that at times either side may raise a good point or two. I also believe that in order to make a better informed decision on things it's good to understand how all sides feel about a situation and listen to all points of agreement and disagreement on an issue. Now the secondary reasoning, and this one is mainly just a personal opinion more than anything, is that i believe we need to be more concerned with matters regarding our country not our political parties, and siding with a political party complicates doing that. I believe that it is possible to have too much identity and it can lead to situations where the country ends up being very polarized. The way my brain processes it is that we need to be a citizen of our country first, and anything else second.

"It's about money. Most large corporations probably get the majority of their domestic revenue from blue & purple states, but a significant portion also from red states. To take an openly political position in either direction could alienate part of their customer base and depress profits.    On top of that, there's a long-running ethical concept that publicly-facing and publicly-traded companies should not endorse political sides, because doing so would be unfair to their customers who are unwillingly financing political causes... whether they happen to agree or disagree with those causes. For example I'm a distance runner and haven't bought a single piece of Underarmor gear since the CEO endorsed Trump in 2016. It's a shame because they're some of the best in the business, but I'm not willing to spend money that could be turned around to support causes and candidates I find terrible.   Both of those motives extend to the private lives of the managerial class. Why? Because they are publicly connected to the company, so if the CFO of Walgreen's comes out and endorses Trump on their private Twitter account, it inevitably gets linked back to Walgreen's as a whole. This is less true for lower-level employees, but the more prominent someone's role in the company, the more their private life is subject to public scrutiny that can spill over to the company. An unfortunate side effect is that the more prominent an executive's role in a company, the more taboo it becomes for them to express partisan beliefs.   All of these are perfectly reasonable and even honorable positions to take wrt public companies.

"Probably some. Most, even. They shouldn't be. Conservatives are bad, and we're not nearly mean enough to them as we should be. Conservatives have been the perennial boat anchors to human progress for centuries, and today, are an existential threat to all peoples, everywhere.  It is one thing to think ""muh free markets"" would handle highways best. Dumb, in my opinion, but then, even I can admit that at least toll roads are nice AND it would force drivers to shoulder the full cost of their habit and likely result in cities migrating to something closer to a ""15-minute"" model. That COULD be described as ""conservative"" but only just.  The real essence of conservatism is creating in-groups and out-groups, in America typically along racial and religious lines, and determining who are and who aren't first-class citizens who enjoy the protections of the law and the benefits of the doubt, and who are the second-class citizens who enjoy the impositions of duty from the law and who do not enjoy such benefits of the doubt. Conservatives, at the end of the day, do not believe in democracy, equality before the law, or human equality and dignity generally.  That cannot be an ideology that is permitted to persist, it is a threat to all who would be deemed a second-class outgroup by them. I'm going to be an old man before we get abortion re-codified into law in this country, and before I don't have to worry about my LGBT friends and family having to fret about their rights every two to four years thanks to the disgrace of two Trump presidential terms.

"Allow me: I’ve worked in dei for a long time. I can definitely tell you why it doesn’t work.   First, how it should: at its best, it employs processes that have the best outcomes for all. Example: removing graduation years from resumes to address ageism. It helps younger people from being knocked off the list because they’re too young, and same for older people. It forces those reading the resume to judge based on the merit of the resume, not saying “they’re too young to know anything” or “they’re too old to keep up”.   Example I shared in another sub this morning: I recently worked on a study looking at negative outcomes for women in STEM fields. The findings were clear that women AND men were experiencing the same barriers that were impeding their growth, progress and success. The only difference was that the women also experienced unambiguously blatant sexism.   So the next steps my team planned to take was to implement policy changes to alleviate the barriers for both women and men in the STEM roles. But simultaneously we planned to address cultural problems that allowed for blatant sexism.   Solutions that “raise all boats” are what solves problems.   So why does DEI not work?  Because we too often lead with emotion and want quick fixes. So when we talked about the blatant sexism, you can imagine the outcry. Rightfully, truly. Some terrible things were happening. But that took over the story. In DEI, the goal has been to “address the burning house”. This was a popular concept used to explain BLM. Yes, all lives do matter, but right now, one house is burning and we need to focus on putting that fire out. But the issue is that focusing only on that fire is like any burning fire: it has a chance to jump across the way and quietly set another house on fire. So addressing one issue without a larger strategic view, can lead to other groups having ignored issues.   Back to the STEM study: men in STEM fields were like, “what about us? We’re facing the same stuff according to the studies”.  and the emotional response  is like, “no, you’re not experiencing sexual harassment, wait your turn”.   So the men become disenfranchised, the pro-men groups are angry. The women are getting the help they need with harassment, but those shared underlying issues are unaddressed at a systemic level for all STEM employees. Both sides lose out. And now the DEI practitioners are frustrated because the narrative has been co-opted. Speaking up gets one side saying we’re anti-women; the other side saying we’re anti-men. The reality is: we’re pro fixing the systemic issues in a way that works for everyone. But that’s not sexy. It doesn’t stoke emotion, gather likes, or look like a policy someone could get promoted on.   We, the DEI practitioners, want a world where everyone is able to contribute fully, where all are equally recognized for their contributions, and where all have equal access and opportunity. Honestly. It’s not some ‘liberal agenda’. But the emotional side hits social media. Creates rage-inducing clickbait. Gets the likes. Gets the interviews.   To be 100% fair: this is rooted in history. In pre-social media life, you needed the impassioned activist willing to put it out there. Because these were peoples without voice. We needed marches in Selma. We needed riots in the street when Rodney king was killed. We needed to show that housing practices discriminate. We needed that because it wasn’t shared. Parts of history were erased. That is absolutely true. If still is. So this emotional response is justified. But the click-bait culture and 24-7 influencer life has amplified it and made it look like it’s everything. Has dominated with sound bites that highlight the dramatic. And engender tribalism. And tribalism, of course, breeds division.   We need a practitioner approach, where all agree that institutions need to be fixed. Not because evil people are keeping them racist or sexist, but because things built by imperfect humans are imperfect. We need to draw a line between disagreement on personal beliefs vs just labeling someone as some kind of “-ist”. We need dialogue, story telling, and exposure to one another outside of echo chamber to remind us that we have more in common than not. That is how you fix things. THAT is DEI, from the view of a certified DEI practitioner and consultant.",Mt_Crumpit,2025-03-08T14:58:39,3

">That makes no sense because you're just getting a group of dipshits to represent the rainbow of skin colors  That's not how it works. For example, a company seeking 10 workers will screen 60, weed this down to 30 equally competent and equally credentialled people, and then of this thirty - as per whatever DEI program they're running - ensure, say, 2 of the final 10 are women and 1 is a minority.  There's no ""lack of competency"" or ""lack of merit"" within these selections, just a small ""algorithm"" being applied at the end to counter or correct for implicit selector bias. And studies show that such sorting methods provide better results for businesses.  >There's also a very good and valid reason that women get filtered out, and that is the biological reality that women can become pregnant.   It's a longstanding and interesting debate.  Regardless, though, in the US the mandated FMLA (family and medical leave) is 12 weeks unpaid which applies to both men and women. And there is no mandated paid maternity or paternity leave. So it's not clear that business are ""losing money"" due to pregnancy, or that these losses aren't offset by the benefits of female workers, or their expanded purchasing power.  Beyond this, to not hire any women because other women can get pregnant is to stereotype and punish individuals based on the behaviour of others. It's textbook discrimination. It's also just morally off: women put up with enough biological stress and unpaid labour. No need to bar them further in order to uphold economic ideals which are morally flawed at the very inception of all markets in the first place. If we're all going to be sociopaths, just drop the pretence and go full sociopath. Don't make arbitrary lines.",Wetness_Pensive,2025-03-07T11:15:20,11

"> It ended up as another way for privileged white people to discriminate against less educated white people using ethnic minorities as a prop, like so many things in our society.  Personal growth and maximizing potential is not a DEI value, but your rationalization for the results of DEI - diminishing the contributions of virulent anti-intellectualism and how that impacted white workers particularly - required no intent or desire for diversity. DEI simply provided a reason to highlight competence and personal growth within corporate monocultures.  And your other point highlights the benefit of DEI to the bottom line: if it's just lip service and virtue signaling, it costs basically nothing. The only candidates it scares away are intimidated by competence and personal growth. The only people it can harm are those who depend on favoritism outside of measurable contributions to sustain their positions.",bruce_cockburn,2025-03-07T10:30:02,8

I see so many stories of individuals explaining how the implementation of DEI policies has negatively affected institutional morale, hiring practices, and overall efficiency, and the *only* rebuttal that can be mustered is ""that's not really DEI""?
