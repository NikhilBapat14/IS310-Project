Yeah because when republicans lie it‚Äôs not like every news station outside of Fox doesn‚Äôt call them out on it. We absolutely don‚Äôt have fact checkers who live to find anything Trump says that is even mildly incorrect. They‚Äôre so busy focusing on Biden‚Äôs lies they just give republicans a free pass,TheMTM45,2025-05-03T14:40:50,10

"This idiot said at the end of February that Trump would lose MASSIVE public support from his base in 30 days due to chaos. He‚Äôs got a LONG history of being flat out wrong.

"They just haven't figured out how the internet works and that we have constant access to anything they've ever said publicly.   Lies, failed promises, and omissions are immediately obvious now. We can fact-check them live, and they are having trouble adjusting to that reality.   Republicans had a much worse problem with that until Trump cleared 12 of them on a stage.",John2H,2025-05-04T00:21:56,0
