"Buh, this makes it look like right wingers don’t actually care about mental health even though that’s right up there with thoughts and prayers. It’s like the only thing that they can get gullible rational people to go along with them on when they’re ignoring or downplaying heinous mass shooter gun crime shit.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-30T12:27:32,21
"As someone who struggled in school, this kind of decision hits close to home.",RoundupRazzle,2025-04-30T12:46:11,7

"The children must be sacrificed to the oligarchy. It is the way Russia operates, too.",DefiantCommand4357,2025-04-30T12:56:25,4
Schools with mental health services on average have less incidents of gun violence.  This is a gateway towards pushing for a larger police presence in schools.,FunnyKillBot,2025-04-30T15:08:21,3
Next up: defunding a program to retrofit auto-locking doors in schools or some BS since they've so vehemently blamed open doors for school shootings.,interwebz_2021,2025-04-30T12:36:11,2
They just look at you like ur insane in a sane world anyways.,TheStockFatherDC,2025-04-30T15:09:06,2
"Yeah, children aren’t a priority. Every wait for my surprised face.",zeroaxs,2025-04-30T15:23:26,2
"ah yes, the mental health funding they all say we need when a shooting happens to deflect blame from the guns. Cool.  Cool.",Pdxduckman,2025-04-30T16:39:16,1
It conflicts with their profit margin.,pjflyr13,2025-04-30T17:13:41,1
so there not gonna help with kids and teens who have mental health issues while also defending the second amendment to the end. that is a dangerous combination,saiyanscaris,2025-04-30T17:50:13,1
This will improve the school shooter statistics,RevolutionaryCard512,2025-05-01T05:06:31,1
"these programs also offered us students subsidies and scholarships to get our msw in exchange to work in these schools without mental health resources. I was one of them, and yesterday we were told that we will no longer be given them and are left high and dry. I was supposed to start my masters next summer, fully payed, and now i have no idea what im going to do.",Former-Pension-4557,2025-05-02T06:25:55,1
I am afraid this will make public schools more dangerous.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-30T12:26:51,4
They never cared in the first place,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-04-30T12:40:42,13
Makes it look like?   They don't care.,GaimeGuy,2025-04-30T12:33:23,8
"They want the ""mental weaklings"" who need mental health assistance to kill themselves.",INAC___Kramerica,2025-04-30T13:47:33,2
they dont care about mental health and they will defend the second amendment to the end. we all know how this is going to end,saiyanscaris,2025-04-30T17:50:46,2
It's enough to make folks wonder if there's some secretive Republican political cult intent on sacrificing as many children as possible to evil Lord Bhaal or something...,interwebz_2021,2025-04-30T12:34:47,6
It fits alongside their pushing for charter schools. They want scared parents take their kids out of public education so they can further defund and kill it while funneling education dollars to themselves and to their religious organizations.,KenNotKent,2025-04-30T13:02:21,3
