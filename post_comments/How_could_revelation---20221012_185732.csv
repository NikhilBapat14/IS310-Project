"> So this inquiry seems intended to discredit widely believed claims that Russian interests sought to influence the 2016 Election, possibly with Trump's tacit approval.  You could argue that intent was to muddy it, sure, but the intent by Russia to influence has already been proven. [The Mueller report](https://www.justice.gov/archives/sco/file/1373816/download) shows instructions to Russian operatives to support Trump (and Senator Bernard Sanders), and the public has seen the back-channel communications between Russian officials and Donald Jr., and the intelligence assessments that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC and disseminating their private communications and strategic documents in a way intended to damage and influence. They paid for the adverts, they made the phone calls. That's all in the historical record already.  > Should it succeed, it will cast doubt on popular perceptions of Russian aims to influence world opinion in general, including support for the war in Ukraine, as well as much criticism of Trump e.g. claims that he is allied with and supports anti-Democratic organizations and leaders, such as Putin.  Although elements of the American right's media machine have been relentlessly pushing pro-Russia views since the war's beginning, these efforts have largely been ineffective. [Recent polling shows most Republicans still supporting Ukraine.](https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/vu1wawsnwb/econTabReport.pdf#page=14) I'm not sure how successfully prosecuting Danchenko changes the situation in favour of Russia or pro-Russia Republicans.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-10-17T01:00:30,6
"Danchenko will probably get a slap on the wrist. [The first charge was already dismissed](https://lawandcrime.com/trump/judge-tosses-john-durham-charge-against-igor-danchenko-that-trumps-lawyers-hoped-would-repel-sanctions-in-failed-clinton-rico-case/) because the Special Counsel tried too aggressively to prosecute him for lying to the FBI, when the truth is, well, he didn't actually lie. There was no malicious intent. Similarly, the trial, as of now, is really only showing the FBI had a legitimate reason to investigate Trump campaign associates. Even if Danchenko's information was no good, neither side knew it at the time, nor could they.  The way this will affect politics? It probably won't affect anything at all. Right-wing Americans invented a narrative about the entire affair a long time ago and will only self-reinforce. No counter-evidence will get through to them; they choose the reality to live in. Other Americans will forget and not know what the trial was even about. The average American isn't aware Durham is investigating anything at all. The reason people disliked Trump was for far more varied and legitimate reasons than just the Steele Dossier - even thinking so belies a vast ignorance about everything else Trump did that was so pointlessly alienating during his short-lived administration. I mean his first impeachment was over blackmailing the President of Ukraine, who is currently fighting for his life right now. That tends to stick out in the mind more than Durham's insinuation that the FBI had one bad subsource in an investigation into the Trump campaign.  &#x200B;  EDIT: Well Danchenko was acquitted. And apparently the reason was because he was actually a pretty reputable and credible source for the FBI. So that's that.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-17T22:44:39,5
"Well Danchenko has been charged with making false statements to the FBI. Also he was paid $200,000. One possible conclusion was that the FBI didn't vet those statements because he was telling them what they wanted to hear. That could make the FBI, who have been accused of invading Mar-a-Lago for political reasons, look bad. That of course casts doubt on the legitimacy of those charges against Trump. You may not live in the US so you may not fully appreciate how ubiquitously the phrase ""Steele Dossier"" is used when getting across the point that much ""evidence"" is fabricated by Democratic operatives. Finding Danchenko guilty might strengthen that argument enough to convince previously skeptical voters who might have previously been willing to give the Biden administration the benefit of the doubt on this.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2022-10-17T12:08:43,-1
"Well I'm quite happy with this outcome, in case that surprises anyone.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2022-10-19T04:54:38,1
">You may not live in the US so you may not fully appreciate how ubiquitously the phrase ""Steele Dossier"" is used when getting across the point that much ""evidence"" is fabricated by Democratic operatives  Uh. I live in the US and I would not say the phrase Steele Dossier is ""ubiquitous"" at all. Most people don't know what that even is if I brought it up in regular conversation. Certain extreme right-wingers do, but they're sort of mentally compromised anyway and are out to hate Democrats regardless, and will make up any reason to do so.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-17T22:39:08,5
"[He was acquitted today of all counts.](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/18/danchenko-acquitted-on-all-counts-in-durham-russia-probe-00062380)   You suggested that perhaps his conviction might sway people who believed the Mueller investigation and Biden administration were innocent of wrongdoing; does the opposite hold true for you? Does the acquittal reassure you, or make you question right-leaning US news sources?",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-10-18T16:19:50,2
"Absolutely. Apparently I gave the impression I want Durham to succeed. Conducting an investigation is one thing but an actual trial gives the impression there's a strong possibility somebody, in this case somebody in the pay of the FBI, committed a crime and the FBI, determined to smear Trump anyway they could, looked the other way. A conviction could have been a big moral victory for those wanting this year's Mar-a-Lago investigation to fail by impugning the credibility of the FBI or at least its top leadership (of course there's a widespread belief that rank-and-file agents are furious about the raid). I don't know why this wouldn't have affected the forthcoming election    BTW I agree that the average American one encounters at the supermarket probably has no idea what the Steele Dossier is but pretty much everyone who regularly discusses politics does.  EDIT I mean absolutely the acquittal reassures me.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2022-10-19T04:30:10,1
