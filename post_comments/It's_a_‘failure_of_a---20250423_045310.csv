"While reading through articles and watching videos related to this lawsuit, I keep seeing/hearing the word ""exposing."""" *We're simply exposing children to these subjects*. The problem is they are doing it in a way that presents these very controversial subjects from one worldview only... the affirming, progressive worldview. There does not appear to be room for open, honest discussion from all sides. Any child questioning the ""truthfulness"" of the content in these books is to be told their comment is ""hurtful."" The children have 2 options...embrace the ideology presented or remain silent.  [Justice Neil Gorsuch followed, noting that teacher guidance says that if a student says a boy can’t be a girl, a teacher should respond that such a comment is “hurtful,” and you shouldn’t use negative words to talk about someone’s identity.](https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/04/22/4-takeaways-as-supreme-court-hears-maryland-lgbt-school-books-case/)  This is not unbiased exposure. This is bullying children into submission. Is it any wonder our children and young adults have zero critical thinking skills.",Farmwife64,2025-04-23T06:37:33,15

"Stuff keeps going to the highest court because Dems will use any lower court they have to do as they please instead of applying the law.  However, that doesn't mean ***it's a bad thing*** that their dirty tricks always end up there. Ending up there means their dirty tricks stop working.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T13:04:30,4
">...be able to read the Bible  At least we could make the argument that the moral tenets of the Bible played a part in shaping this nation. Like it or not, the Bible is part of our history. ""Uncle Bobby's Wedding"" is not.",Farmwife64,2025-04-23T06:48:54,10
