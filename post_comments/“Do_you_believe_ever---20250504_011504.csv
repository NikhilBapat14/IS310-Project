"Fox News, Breitbart, and One America News Network don't have required logins and paywalls. CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and The Economist all require a login now. Even the National Review, a conservative but not MAGA voice, requires a login.  The only free US news sources are now hard right.  To know what's going on today, you have to read many sources. That's now hard.  If you read Fox News, read to the end of the stories. The headlines and lede paragraphs are optimized for clickbait. About three paragraphs in, the actual reporting starts to come through.",Animats,2025-05-04T14:24:52,6
I’m not a masochist so I just avoid them as much as possible as I wait for reality to have its turn at-bat.,SandiegoJack,2025-05-05T15:32:59,1
"You’re spot on about the 3rd paragraph having the actual news. The two paragraphs leading up to it lay the groundwork for how you’re supposed to interpret it:  1. “Trump sets date for new tariffs”   2. In a new directive backed by his economic advisors Trump announced the date will mark the beginning of his rollout of tariffs to increase US self reliance and boost the economy.    3. (Insert made up date here) has been set for new tariffs to go into effect. Some analysts outside the administration have warned that tariffs may negatively impact the economy causing some investors urging caution. The administration has stated that any negatives are a direct result of the Biden administration’s decisions before being voted out of office.   I worded it similarly to them as well. They usually skip direct quotes and instead will go back and forth between their voice and someone else’s. “Trump announced the date will mark the  beginning of his rollout of tariffs to increase US self reliance and boost the economy.”  See how you can interpret it as “Trump says it will boost the economy” or it can be “We are reporting it as a fact that the tariffs will boost the economy”. (A real news organization would have made it clearer, “…and boost the economy **according to Trump and his cabinet**”.",Stopikingonme,2025-05-04T16:08:01,4
