"Not mentioned in this article is that Buffet has been hoarding cash since fall.  He's up to almost $350B sitting on the sidelines waiting for the crash he is expecting.  He isn't just blowing smoke, and it isn't political.   He's putting his money where his mouth is.",ms_moogy,2025-05-03T12:20:52,29

"I will say this, the number one thing Trump has craved all his life is to be one of the truly elite.    You can't buy class. He'll never get into their clubs, that's why he built his own.
