"Remember, Republicans don't care about babies. They only care about the unborn.   Bill Gates has been among the least shitty billionaires. At least he learned from Carnegie that he can recover reputation by giving his wealth away. ",thistimelineisweird,2025-05-09T13:13:50,51
“Critics have accused Gates of using his foundation’s charitable status as a tax shield and of parlaying his billions into undue influence on global health priorities.”   Influence on global health prioritizes?  Oh how horrible.,-Dee-Dee-,2025-05-09T20:02:26,16

"If we the people have lost our power because our elected leaders are so feckless, if these billionaires do not reverse course their legacy will so much worse than the gilded age, they will not be remembered kindly AT all. As it stands they would have to cure cancer, stop global warming, end world hunger and move us into a truly egalitarian society to make up for the amount of wealth they have done nothing to prevent themselves from accumulating.  If you still believe our economic system works you are truly delusional and have bought the lie.",techiered5,2025-05-09T22:04:45,1

"They don’t care for the unborn either. They are fine with forcing a sick fetus to be born into a short, agonizing life of pain.

They do not care about fetuses or born babies, they just want to control women. Period.",Inner_Pressure8582,2025-05-09T19:21:22,5
