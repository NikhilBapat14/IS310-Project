Can someone clarify the details for me?  It sounds like the mother was deported and the child was taken with her.  It doesn't clarify if the child as deported (government saying they have to go) or if the mother was taking the child with her since a mother probably isn't going to leave her young child behind.  edit:  I looked into it a bit.  ICE is claiming that the mother wished to take the child with her when she being deported.  What's a bit more fucked up though is that ICE agents snatched her and her sister up when they went to an immigration office for a scheduled check-in.  Basically ICE is snatching up immigrants who are doing the right thing and navigating our bureaucracy.,Ilosesoothersmaywin,2025-04-26T14:46:12,11

For the 2 yr old, she, her sister, and mother were arrested when they were literally at their regular immigration check-in. As in, when they were following the law.   The father has legal status. Per ICE's own written directives, they are mandated to coordinate care with family or caretakers for minors (legal or not) instead of detainment. They made no attempt to do this. They let the mother talk to the father for less than a minute and then hung up the phone.   The father's lawyers filed an emergency petition for her to be released into his custody, but the government showed up in court with a letter they claim was written by the mother saying she was taking the child with her. The judge was aware the deportation flights was already in the air, but required the government to get her on the phone when she landed to verify she wrote that letter. The government called back later that afternoon with a claimed oopsie, oh well. They missed her and she was already released in Honduras.  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/25/us-citizen-deportation-donald-trump-00311631  https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/04/trump-deportation-two-year-old-us-citizen-cancer-disregard-due-process-new-orleans/  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/26/judge-ice-deported-two-year-old/83293111007/  Separately, in [this article](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-04-26/ice-deports-the-mother-of-a-breastfeeding-infant-and-a-2-year-old-who-is-a-us-citizen) it mentions a breastfeeding mother was deported even though her baby is still here.",undercurrents,2025-04-26T13:51:16,800

"“The unborn” are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don’t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don’t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don’t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don’t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?

Republicans who are not part of the cult this bubble created are afraid of the cult and won't act against it. Democrats are mostly not afraid of the cult, but are weak in their fight against it because they, too, are backed by the same corporate masters as Republicans.

So essentially, ""would you like your child to go with you - entirely voluntarily - or would you like to leave them to the US foster care system?"", and the note that the question was asked and the answer to that question that was recorded may or may not have been what actually happened/the parent actually said.  Unfortunately, every source I've seen so far tries to obfuscate this aspect as much as possible, because ""US CITIZEN DEPORTED"" gets more clicks than ""deported non-citizen mother takes her US citizen child with her instead of leaving them in the foster care system"". That makes it hard to establish what actually happened.  In particular, it's unclear if any of the children had fathers who would have been allowed to stay.

Fringe online activity created Donald Trump and brought fascism to America - one person at a time, comments did more than the post to fake news articles nobody ever   bothered to even follow the link to glance at.  I specifically chose Reddit to become politically active online bc its maybe the most conversational place on the internet. Talking to others is how we share ideas. Its more significant than we realize bc not all of us need to be pitched an idea, for all of us to eventually accept it - only somewhere around 65% of a population needs to believe something before all of a sudden everyone does.  Reddit is a self selected subsect of the general population, so the rule is essentially the same here but with a lower number than 65 bc we are all more similar than we aren't - evidence of this can be see with how quickly cenaorship happened around specific topics.  In general tho, Reddit has radically moved left - not only in sentiment but in language, rhetoric, expectations, and ideas about how we should move forward - much of this is new, before last November there really wasnt a left.  Today a young man, made the Vice Chair of rhe DNC to placate him - is now being threatened essentially by the Dinosaurs nc he wasn't placate at all, in fact he intends to primary the Dinosaurs for younger Democrat candidates - this is the beginning of the end of the Boomers in politics.

It seems some people's happiness is derived from harming others, so that's not enough alone for me anymore. It wasn't really enough to start with.

Career ICE Agents, as it is their job, to find, arrest, and deport people for a living regardless of who is President - their experience means they most certainly know better than some random appointed MAGAT yes man.  Every ICE Agent upset at the prospect of their soon upcoming trials when Trump leaves - needs to be asked, and made to answer with the best of their knowledge, the following questions:   *How many Trans people are you aware of existing in or visibly around your daily life? Have ever met a Trans child?*  *Before Trump's 2nd Term, how many American Citizens had you deported?*  *How many people did ICE deport to a Third Party Country other than the deportees' country of origin?*  *How many deportees were Children under the age of 18? How many children did ICE deport that were American citizens?*  *How many American Citizens, under the age of 18, did ICE deport that were also then currently battling cancer?*  *How many times in the past had a sitting US Senator personally visited a mistakenly deported man, being held without intent to ever release, by a government entirely unrelated to him?*  I believe the actual answer before, to all the above questions is zero, save maybe legit mistakes made in the past.

"I understand following laws - I obviously respect the law myself, thats precisely the reason I can't support ICE as they've been conducting themselves. I want the laws to be in place for me - especially if I ever break them.  The law protecting the guilty from those enforcing law and order is one of the primary purposes for having laws. ICE deporting US citizens, I don't care if they are the infants of illegal immigrants that have committed crimes, that is illegal, it is unconstitutional and infringes upon the most basic of expectations that we as citizens can have of our government.  ICE is indefensible - supporting their deportations or the arrests of political dissenters is un-American.   In times like these, the actual Patriot and the actual Revolutionary look more alike than a Patriot and a LEO.  This particular issue falls down if one thinks about immigration at all. All of the immigrants that are here of their own choosing, *legally migrated* as compared to immigration like Ellis Island - most of our Great Grandparents and their Parents couldn't read, write, speak English, and showed up with no money, hungry, and needing somewhere to stay.  40% of Americans trace their ancestry directly back to Ellis Island. Nobody wanted those immigrants here either, but it was obviously one of the smartest things America has ever done.  If you can get here, from wherever else, thats the only requirement I have - I want every immigrant, regardless of their situation. Immigrants make people you know, and people are the most valuable resource.  We ought to feed them, clothe them, and give them a roof - so they can make babies and we can make up all that money off their descendents, those gains are exponential - the best kind.

It will take an election or two to rid ourselves of the Dinosaurs that can't wrap their heads around being incredibly aggressive politically speaking - both in their interactions with their opposition and also their platform.

The US has never had a true left withing the Democeatic Party - its a party of centrists that lean right.  Trumpers think left = DEI, so this is going to go over some heads bc its never meant that at all, there can be an ultra left wing of the Dems that doesn't even include Trans issues in their platform.  Tbh, I think thats the simplest way forward - coming back to that particular part of culture war after they've had power for awhile, which is also about to happen - a generation of control handed to the most liberal American politicians that we've never had.

She pointed out that her kids, including one with medical needs, were born here. I said that I wasn't an immigration attorney; that might help her, but I couldn't be sure. She said something like, ""But if I get deported, my [medically needy] baby can't go back to Mexico. She can't get the help she needs there."" And I had to point out then that her daughter, as a citizen, wasn't at risk of deportation because she's a citizen. But if the mom was taken into ICE custody, the kids might go into the foster care system instead, here in the US. The woman was devastated - it was like a fire hose of bad news.

"Milgram is an *incredibly famous* study. It's literally one of the best known psychology experiments of the 20th century along with the Stanford prison study.   That said, it does NOT explain what is going on here (Honestly, the Stanford Prison study is probably more applicable where people in positions of authority are likely to abuse it, not the obeying of unethical orders of those in authority). If this is your degree, you really need to research it more. It's far more nuanced.   Even at the most basic level, you would need to match the situational factors of the study that are not present here- first is being in physical proximity of the person you are forcing into suffering. Milgram had them in separate rooms. Not watching the person as they inflicted suffering (in other replications of the study, obedience fell drastically when they could physically see the person suffer, and even further when they themselves had to put the person's hand on the shocker).   Second, it made a complete difference if the person of authority was standing next to the participant or in another room. They were far less likely to comply if orders came from another room. (along those lines, though, in a variation of this study, obedience *increased* when the participant told an assistant to deliver the shock, which diffuses personal responsibility. That would explain how the officials who make policies like this or declare war so easily without thinking of the human suffering element since they pass the actual enforcement on to others).  Third, participants were told there would be no lasting harm to the ""learner."" Clearly not the case here.   There are other elements that vary that seriously matter here.   This is also why Milgram is NOT an explanation for the Holocaust by any means. But you can compare elements of the Holocaust to ICE. This administration along with the GOP for many years now, like Germany, has been engaging in propaganda and rhetoric blaming society ills on these ""others."" They are taking your jobs, r*ping your women, eating your pets, are all drug traffickers, committing constant crime, using up government resources, illegally voting en masse, they're all gang members, they're animals, many probably have AIDS, poisoning the blood of our country, they have wrecked our country, the Dems are secretly flying in murderers and terrorists, spread misery, crime, poverty, disease and destruction to communities all across our land, they're coming from from mental institutions and insane asylums so ‘Silence of the Lambs’ stuff, they trying to build a little army in our country, they're' infesting our country, they're invading our country, and most importantly, making the white race a minority. (these are all words out of Trump's mouth)  When you demonize a group that much, it's incredibly easy to treat them inhumanely. Because you simply don't see them as equal to you, or even deserving of humanity. I remember when the ""caravan"" was making it's way here, they were interviewing people with lake houses in Northern Minnesota who were arming themselves convinced illegal aliens are going to cross the border and murder them in their homes... in Northern Minnesota.   *That's* what's going on here.

"I've been looking into that and two things - the first being that is a monumental task and it requires a clearly defined establishment of right and wrong and how crimes have been committed - and that people believe the crimes they committed actually are crimes and accept their punishments as ""their just desserts"" correctly given them by their fellow citizens.  This was why it was illegal for many years in Europe to deny the holocaust - bc that's a lie and, specifically, a fascist lie, so that kind of language couldn't be allowed.  Fascism is an illness - we must cure ourselves of it, one infected person at a time, bc otherwise and this is my 2nd thing:  If fasicm isn't wholly beaten and defeated so soundly that none can defend it - some will keep in their hearts but be silent about doing so.   Thats what a Trumper is - a silent fascist, silent no more bc Trump freed them from the chains of their oppressions (basic human decency, politeness, women's, DEI, immigrants, women, children, judges etc). Beyond the talking points/current narratives - Trumpers aren't expected to know more than they've been told to say.  They only hear from mouthpieces and those ""leaders are always itching their ears - telling them exactly what they want to hear, ""The brown and trans people are to blame for everything"" - that's tough.  Sorry for the rant, I've thought a bit about this.  So, we do Nuremberg and pass new laws and reinforce old ones, maybe do an amendment or two.   What defeats the silent fascist tho?

"I'm sorry but my personal experience has taught me very clearly - there is most definitely writing on the wall and its  not as specific as you are suggesting. I'm not making up anything at all when I implied my nephew might be deported. He isnt white. Thats enough alone where he is. He also has a black name - I don't mean that in a racist sense, but I do in a literal sense. The distinction is significant. I'll explain.  (*There is also a heavy fascist play built atop the racism but I'm trying not be censored but still say everything, regarding racism apecifically, all in one this spot, tbh - I've never been able to.*)  My family are the only white people I'm aware with our last name - there are many well known athletes tho.   I've been assumed to be black by people that only know of me thru text - I've for real had several white people tell me that almost immediately after meeting me in person, but having already exchanged emails for work. I've had people walk back racism upon seeing me. I know a name is enough for a racist.  *Critical thinking skills are not in the typical racist skillset.*  Almost universally, every white racist I'm aware of is among the least educated and poorest people in my life. Statistically, I can attest much personal exlerience, destitute white people are often likely to be the loudest and most ardent Trumpers. All overlook the extreme respective wealth gap - all bc Trump gives them permission to be racist.  The cold hard truth is - in every Trumper heart, *""only white is right""*. I've had that said to me so many times. I'm rural in a heavily red county, but in one the bluest states.   Make Ameica Great Again really means *white*, *""again""*, like some imaginary time in the 50s. They don't mean white + the legal Mexican immigrants. They just mean white. My distinction semantically is very significant. Notice how I'm making no exceptions. The white racists' entire identity revolves around their racism - they can't make exceptions.  That flawed perception of superiority is the only possible thing that could ever allow people in their economic class to look down on anyone. They have shitty lives and know anything, so they've latched onto that. So, it can't just be thr criminal illegals, bc then they have to move that hate - so broader illegal, but solve that... what then?  It will begin with ""illegals"" then be the non-permanent legal and but actual foreigners, then will be the naturalized citizens from not Europe - especially 1st and 2nd generations. People like my nephew - actual citizens, 3rd generation, but clearly not white and having significant cultural identity influenced by the immigrant family - they will be next. They will have to be bc their parents are in the group before them. They are rn setting the precedent that children will follow their parents, despite their own individual rights.  I've had so many Trumpers promise me totally voluntarily, seemingly randomly, without my asking in any way, that they have no issues with me or anyone like me (I'm Gay). They then say something like, people do have to stay in their lane tho (I get cens o red explaining this so often).  I feel less safe each time I have such a conversation. I've never reassured someone that I wouldn't do something to them, that I've never thought about or considered myself doing beforehand.  I'm being reassured because from their own point of view, language and rhetoric - I have every reason to be concerned. They are making a distinction abput me, for themselves in their own minds, a self justification that allows them to stay the course in their willful and deliberate ignorance.  You asked about the the status of my ex sister in law having some sort of court order regarding her possible criminality or parole - didn't You ask me that bc if she did have a record, that could, in a very real sense, complicate my citizen nephew not being deported? That is not OK.  If it can happen to my nephew, it can happen to me - it can happen to you. I'm speaking loudly now, bc I'll go camp before most, so my absence being noticed is significant to me.  Like I said, if this isnt the line, where is it going to be?  At this point, I don't trust these people deporting, or even imprisoning any Americans.

I really only address China at the beginning and end of this book, if.you are curious, just skip to the end. Im just.not mentioning tons of things, like China being overextended - Im aware of all the issue with everything I present here but I also think, with little effort, this is all very plausible and almost certainly will be identified as a possibility.  Xi for sure as China will essentially absorb all the power we are just letting go of right now. Putin hates that Xi is going to maybe move into the current Ameican position - he wants a mulipolar world, not a new hegemon. China is seeing maybe the greatest opportunity any civilization has ever given another, I'm having a difficult time truly conveying the gravity and immensity of Americas mistake.   It might be the single most foolish thing a great power has ever done. Considering the peak of our power, as the most powerful country in the history of human civilization, was in December of 24. The fact that we undid ourselves before May - its hard, very hard for me not to be livid and in a near rage all the time.  The American Future where lead an increasingly more interconnected humanity into space and the age of automation - where we always matter and American children always have the most opportunity, the best shot at the best life - thats all gone. We increasingly more resemble North Korea or Iran than we resemble the America that ended in January of this year.  We will be globally cancelled in such a way that removes any necessity of interacting with the US - thats bc they dont want us to lead the world anymore, they have no intention of starting back up any sort of dependency on America or our money.  All of this is exactly what was going to happen bc tariffs are an act of war if they are mutually set between the countries involved. Tariffs have a very real function and use that does in face create and sustain specific economic activity - Trump has not used tariffs like that, correctly, once, not a single time.  If Trump isnt a Russian, intentionally sabotaging our Country - he must be an actual idiot, I'm not playing at all, if this wasn't intentional, our Country is being led by a sub 90. If its intentional he's one of the most effective politicians that has ever lived.  It doesn't matter tho. I'm not willing to wait til 28 tbh.  I'd like to see President Johnson in 26 and maybe Walz in 28. We maybe need someone more aggressive and far more left.  If we can take power away from Trump, before an actual presidential election year, the entire world would understand the incredible significance of that and it would do much to repair our image and trust in American  stability.  If Trump gets a 3rd term. I'll have to think more locally - at that point Minnesota would be much better served in the future, the mid to long term especially, as a part of Canada or even an independent country.  If we have open elections again tho - I think impeachment of the entire Administration, followed subsequently by the legal proceedings that will bring all of them to trial, a public trial - the whole world will watch us either establish again an America that we can be proud of, or the whole world will watch us divy up and go our own ways.  Xi is absolutely thrilled bc he has so many ways to get to the top spot now - 2 months ago China had zero chances of ever running the world, he's definitely thrilled.   Putin far less so. Xi can placate Europe by also expanding China - into what is now Russia, but doesn't have to be and is completely acceptable enemy, that has crossed a moral line - China can be a hero to the west if they defeat Putin, it will undeniable. That is the only way I can see Euros kinda just pretending China is the Us.  Bc that would be the easiest solution, it doesn't really require the status quo to change much, with Putin gone, now its collaboration to rebuild Ukraine, exactly rhe kind of the China can step in do something only a superpower can do - that obviously isnt going to be free, exactly as we operate now, helping others to help ourselves even more. China is the only other country that can actually maybe do that.  Edit// None of this would have occured or could have occurred - without Trump doing what he has done.",jakktrent,2025-04-27T16:19:12,2
The controversy is that people apparently think that the Trump administration should make people leave their kids behind if they’re deported.  Or maybe just not enforce immigration law in cases where enforcing it could negatively affect anyone.,ShenAnCalhar92,2025-04-26T19:12:31,1
"I comment that people should maybe focus on the constitutional crisis in your country instead of what Trump wore to a funeral, you immediately introduce another topic in your response instead of talking about what's going on in your country, again.

But you worded it like you believe you are somehow shielded from this decent into right wing authoritarianism (of which this focus on triviality is a *symptom*), but you're not.  What is Pierre Poilievre if not your own home grown version of a right wing authoritarian?  This isn't just a USA problem.

I think reading his responses he could be a trumper or just frustrated by things being thrown out without a factual basis - you both approached it in a pretty confrontational way. I’m not going to dig into his history to work it out but we do have to be really careful in not getting carried away because there’s every possibility it gets much worse before it gets better.

"Thanks for the link. It’s kindof interesting to see that in 2018, another judge was arrested by the FBI for allegedly doing this exact same thing; letting a defendant exit through a backdoor away from ICE agents who were there to arrest them.   Maybe judges dislike it when people usurp their immediate authority and jurisdiction.",zerosaved,2025-04-26T15:56:57,3

Its hard knowing the most likely scenarios ahead of us and just seeing each day that passes the worse possible future become higher and percentage of likely being what happens.

The difference here is that this judge knew what has happened when ice takes people.  She tried to prevent an illegal and unconstitutional kidnapping and trafficking to either a life of slavery or death.  Being undocumented and hitting your wife is not a crime deserving of slavery or death.  Due process must happen for all. Every time.,ShrodesCat42,2025-04-26T16:07:33,14

"You don’t know the most likely scenarios though. You are acting on feelings and a narrative that’s being pushed. Life is unpredictable.   The bleakness is real but it’s mostly in your mind’s reaction to it.   If you’re interested in actual positive places, writing long diatribes online about gloom and doom of it all is not the place to start.   This is a type of addiction to engage with, so I can’t blame you for doing so.   Turn off your devices for 3 hours a day. That’s my actionable advice. Engage with life.   Realize they want you to feel this way.   And you do.   So, you left them win.   You willingly succumb to the feelings they want you to have. There is one way you can win. I’ve written about it.   But for now, you let them win. That’s a shame. At least take regular breaks to ground yourself.   The hate/despair train will be right there waiting for you to get back onboard, toot toot, at all hours of every day, always, till the day you die.   It’s always been like that. Always.

"Or that, yeah. You’re absolutely right. And it’s a moot point about whether only citizens deserve due process, because we already have precedence that ICE deports legal citizens without due process, anyways. Truly it is a colossal shame that our own federal government, which claims to be the law, so openly disregards such rule of law - and something so sacred to the fabric of our country as the Constitution no less.",zerosaved,2025-04-26T16:16:43,2

"Unfortunately, I do know the most likely scenarios.  I dont follow narratives, I dont listen to any speak at me about anything, I dont read Op Ed's- I glean the news from all that is happening - I dont even really read the news.  I dont follow narratives, I predict them and all that they will being along and where they will go and how they will change. I helped set a few of the narratives we have now.  You dont know me and I can't convey the truth of this statement without sounding super arrogant, so you will write me off anyways.  The future is kinda my thing. People that know me are disturbed by how much I've had to stop.  We are all essentially the same. Business will alway make decisions for profits, governments for power, there are always trillions of options but only tens of those options that we ever pick. If you know what someone wants, you can predict almost everything they will do. If you dont knoe what someone wants, just insert greed, and you'll functionally be correct in your predictions most of the time.  I used to have to think about the how all this comes together and see the systems and you dont care.  I dont even have to think anymore to know what will most likely happen in any given scenario - its literally an intuitive function now, not only am I able to predict with incredible accuracy, I do that instantly, instantly.  I don't even logically understand how it can possibly, I often know things in that instant, that I can't know but it's always right.  I'm always watching things just play out.",jakktrent,2025-04-28T13:20:03,1

For example, I just came across an email I sent after Trump moved the embassy his first term, I spelled out everything that has just happened in Israel bc it was obvious that it was going to be the result of that - consequences, thats all it is.  Im a single person - I use this ability to make people uncomfortable with their bad decisions by telling them what will come of them, that they dont know, largely bc they haven't thought about it.
