"""GOP leaders on Capitol Hill signaled Thursday they are scaling back their tax-cutting ambitions after running into difficulty making deep spending cuts and facing stern warnings from Republican deficit hawks who are threatening to vote against Trump’s sprawling megabill.""",straygoat193,2025-05-09T12:26:38,8
"As  usual, Trump bullshitting about doing things he has no intention of doing.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-09T12:35:49,6
"I've posted this before but we all know what's coming and should have known from the beginning. The tax cuts will be allowed to expire for the middle class. They'll cut their proposals for no tax on tips and no tax on social security.   But they'll extend the tax cuts for the top brackets, and probably lower the corporate rate.",blueclawsoftware,2025-05-09T13:10:27,4

"Sooo, if the people that own the majority of the wealth don't pay taxes, then the government goes bankrupt. DUH",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-09T15:33:12,1
"Yes, if he gave a damn at all about this bill, he would be spending less time renaming shit and focusing on the bill.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T12:43:22,2
"No, Trump wants the top bracket to pay more. You apparently didn’t read the article.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-09T13:50:12,-2
So why has he only done the opposite of that?,brdlee,2025-05-09T15:10:02,3
"That was yesterday, this is today when he already walked that back. Also I read this article and many others. The next time the GOP lowers taxes for the middle class while raising them for the top brackets will be the first, so I'm not holding my breath.",blueclawsoftware,2025-05-09T16:24:03,1
"Do you even know what is going on in congress? Don’t get your news from Reddit. They are are hashing out a tax cut plan, he isn’t doing anything opisite.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-09T15:28:12,0
"Fake news, he did not walk it back. It was today that Washington post made their article, not yesterday. They can’t cut taxes and not touch entitlements. Mod republicans won’t touch entitlements. Trump doesn’t want Medicaid and Social Security touched.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-09T16:36:11,0
You’re full of it he’s back tracked on the new tax bracket already. He only even mentioned it because people like you only read headlines.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-09T15:50:28,3
Good advice not sure how that’s relevant to my question but if you’re not aware Trump passed tax cuts in his first term that mostly reduced taxes on corporations and large land owners. This isn’t a conspiracy or anything. Im just asking why you would trust congress and not Trump’s past actions? Like when Biden said he was gonna defeat cancer you didn’t just believe him right? Or do you feel Trump has earned the benefit of the doubt to not be questioned?,brdlee,2025-05-09T15:52:38,2
You are the one putting out fake news. He can’t tack anything on the Bill has not even been voted on. He did not back track anything. The news came out today that said congress can increase the tax’s on the rich and you can’t stand it can you? You want your messaging to be that he takes from the poor to give to the rich.,Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-09T16:39:19,1
"Not really sure how he could “tack anything on,” considering he’s not in Congress. Furthermore, things don’t get voted on and then things tacked on or removed unless the vote fails. Think you might want to get some school house rock going.",Most_Technology557,2025-05-09T16:44:39,1
You are the one who said it.,Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-09T21:17:43,1
