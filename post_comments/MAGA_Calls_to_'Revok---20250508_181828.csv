"Yeah, it's almost exclusively used by anti-vaxx idiots to describe the COVID vaccine specifically.  It physically hurts me that they think they're ""owning the libs"" by saying shit like that.",HyperactivePandah,2025-05-08T22:26:26,12

"Oh man. There are rabbit holes to go down on this too. They view peoples' blood who got the ""jab"" to be inferior, so some will refuse blood transfusions or request one from their family member so they can guarantee that they don't get vaccinated blood.
