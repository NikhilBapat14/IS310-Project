"Does China expend as much energy trying to directly kneecap US growth and innovation as much as the latter does the former? In the last few years, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to view this competitive relationship any other way. Can’t help but feel that it was extremely naive to think of us as the “good guys” all this time. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-09T08:02:47,4

"No you've got the gist of it.  He's going to have a tough time negotiating this deal with most of China's largest trading partners. The UK doesn't even break the top 5 list, so the real litmus test will be to see if he can get this kind of deal with Japan or South Korea. But like you said, if those countries agree to this kind of deal they'd effectively be kneecapping themselves to help us at their own expense. We are not the good guys here.",Traditional-Level-96,2025-05-09T08:07:05,5
"China is one of the primary financiers of the RNC.  So yeah, they do spend a lot of money intentionally need capping American growth.",Deinosoar,2025-05-09T08:17:07,-2
