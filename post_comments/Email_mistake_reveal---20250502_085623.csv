"Of course I‚Äôm disturbed by this news, though I knew it was coming. However, I am just as disturbed by HOW incompetent this administration is!! (I mean, that spreadsheet could have contained ANY sensitive government data....)  Snippet:  >The information was mistakenly included in an email sent Wednesday to grant recipients at universities and nonprofits by an HHS employee, who asked them to review and update their contact information.  >**HHS recalled the message only after the spreadsheet, which had a column on whether funding would ‚Äúterminate‚Äù or ‚Äúcontinue‚Äù for each grant, had been downloaded by recipients.** A department spokesperson said the document contained ‚Äúoutdated and predecisional information‚Äù but did not rule out that research inside the ACF could be cut.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T08:56:57,21

"I feel like I'm looking around at commenters, articles, fellow citizens, the news media, universities, unions, women, people of color, and the rest of our pluralistic, messy, awesome country of people like a single cow looking around at a bunch of other cattle as we are being marched into a holding pen.   We all know what is at the end of this. We all have a pretty good idea, at this point, who is holding the bolt gun.   Do we all know that we're not cattle but in fact human beings with the same organizational capability as our opponents?",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T09:15:00,11
I lost all feelings of disturbed and now I'm just tired. It's like watching a horror movie and you know exactly how the main character can avoid getting killed but they keep doing the dumb thing anyways.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-02T08:59:05,8
Force children to be born into poverty into poverty yet cut funding on the programs that help children living in poverty.   It‚Äôs almost like only children of rich donors deserve things like education and food,snvoigt,2025-05-02T09:55:15,3
This is all fine. We all know that the Billionaire class need more hand outs‚Ä¶at our expense. Help us Skynet.,Tricky-Efficiency709,2025-05-02T10:38:30,2
"Maybe it was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù I really sincerely hope there are some people that are working against this, and this is their way of getting the heat turned up.",One_Olive_8933,2025-05-02T18:50:13,2
Her email! You'd never see anything so careless from the Trump administration!,Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-02T09:47:37,7
"If we run it's giving them carte blanche to trample the country and those who choose to stay. If we fight it puts a target on the rest of the community's back, assuming we're not immediately hurt or arrested ourselves. It's a difficult decision to have to make.",VeryGayLopunny,2025-05-02T12:14:47,1
"That's what they want. They want you to get angry at every little absurdity, exhaust yourself fretting about it, and then you disengage to spare your own sanity. When you disengage, it allows power to do whatever it wants.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-02T09:08:01,13
"AND, Trump's pathetic attempt to get more Americans to have babies!üôÑ  Yeah, have more babies but don't expect us to provide them with quality education or enough money to afford housing or food or baby items or a healthy environment, etc.etc.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T10:07:26,3
Well those children will one day inherit their parent‚Äôs money and continue donating to the party so we must keep them alive and fed. Poor and middle-class children aren‚Äôt useful so we can let them starve!¬†,chrisscan456,2025-05-02T10:40:23,2
"It took me a bit to get your point, and yeah, that would be a nice thought:)",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T19:20:16,2
"I know it is, friend.   I can't say more than that besides we're all here learning to vocalize something better than a ""moo"" and looking for any clusters of people learning how to stand upright together, build a galvanizing mythology that meets this moment and assemble an alternative that renders this situation obsolete.  Take heart that, as many people as there seems to be in the MAGA strain, there are far more who are starting to figure out what we are losing by capitulating to it.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T12:20:19,2
"But if I don't disengage, I'm going to exhaust myself. And if I do disengage, I give them power. It's so annoying¬†",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-02T09:10:16,10
"You don't let it get to you. Let it slide away. Pick your battles. Keep paying attention, but do your best not to let the small stuff bother you.  For example, the recent controversy about Whitmer talking at a Trump ""rally."" I scanned a couple articles: It was an announcement that a major military base in MI wasn't gong to close. Her words amounted to how important the base was and a thanks for the announcement. Now, let it go. It doesn't matter and isn't worth getting worked up about. Even if you disagree with her being there, she's a sitting governor and must interact with the President sometimes.  If something seems like it was purpose built to piss people off, then it probably was, and should be treated accordingly. It's much more important to save your energy for the big things. Things like US citizens getting deported now. Things like ignoring judicial rulings. Pick your battles, and those are big battles with big consequences.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-02T09:23:57,5
"Don't exhaust yourself!  I am addicted to the news, which is not healthy and I know it. But, my personality is such that I have to communicate!  As far as giving them power, whether or not YOU/WE engage or disengage they will still have power, unfortunately. (For now....)  Just make sure to vote and if you ""want"" to do something, then you decide what that something is. But, don't make yourself sick because that will do nobody any good:)",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-02T09:54:49,2
...ok. I'll try to keep attention on only important battles then.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-02T19:31:56,1
"And reach out to your friends and others in the community. You pick your battles, they pick theirs; You don't have to fight every one, and neither do they. When you need to take a step back, breathe, regroup, let them carry the burden for a bit, and do the same when they need their break.",CoopDonePoorly,2025-05-02T20:40:29,2
