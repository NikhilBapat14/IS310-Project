Is this that stochastic terrorism we were all worried about?,AuroraItsNotTheTime,2024-07-13T18:07:48,8
"One bystander confirmed dead and on critically injured.   Reports say the shooter has been killed, but no additional information on that.   Watching the video, had Trump been facing the front of the audience,  the bullet would would have pierced his skull.",Swiggy1957,2024-07-13T19:16:48,3
Would the assassination attempt have been more impactful if it happened closer to election day?. It seems with the current political climate neither side can milk anything for longer than a couple weeks. I'm wondering if this will be different considering it's an assassination attempt.,[deleted],2024-07-13T23:18:23,2
Why did the secret service allow Trump to stick his head up when he was leaving the stage?,doggadavida,2024-07-14T09:04:14,1

"When speculating, who do you believe had a more significant impact on the shooter to commit this act: the media, the intelligence community, or both?",Silly_Ad2805,2024-07-13T22:12:23,-2
"Insufficient information to say, wait and see.  It's not that high on the list of stochastic terror threats/likelihoods though from what little I know of them.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-13T19:20:25,3
"Given Biden made comments about putting Trump in the ""bullseye"", we're getting a bunch of Republicans concern trolling about violent rhetoric. I've always thought the ""stochastic terrorism"" thing was BS anyways.",290077,2024-07-14T11:56:04,2
"They probably didn’t expect him to do something so contrary to self preservation, and weren’t in a position to prevent it.",Mrgoodtrips64,2024-07-14T16:12:57,2
"[They'd killed the shooter by that point.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/trump-injured-fine-after-apparent-assassination-attempt-leaves-111926257)  > Someone could be heard near the microphone saying, “Get down, get down, get down, get down!” as agents rushed to the stage. They piled atop Trump to shield him as other agents took up positions on stage to search for the threat.  > Afterward, voices were heard saying, “Shooter’s down” several times, before someone asked, “Are we good to move?” and “Are we clear?” Then someone ordered, “Let’s move.”  It was still probably kind of dumb in case there'd been a second shooter somewhere, but they'd been given the all-clear.",anneoftheisland,2024-07-14T23:07:08,1
"Speculation makes no sense until the background of the person gets more clear. The world is, and people are, far too complex to just speculate right off the bat. It's not constructive.",lucioIenoire,2024-07-14T11:53:37,2
"Also, the shooter seems to have been radicalized by the Epstein stuff, and not by any strong rhetoric comparing Trump to Hitler. I think that makes the argument weaker. Should the media not report on the Epstein stuff because some crazy person might decide to harm one of the people involved?",AuroraItsNotTheTime,2024-07-14T12:47:58,2
