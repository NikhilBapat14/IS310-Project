"It sometimes is considered a declaration of war.  In this case Russia chooses not to call it such directly because they're having trouble enough, and if Russia formally declares it a war with the West then the West is more likely to use direct military force.  Right now both Russia and the West choose to not engage in a direct fight with their militaries, so that's how it is.  This also has a long history of happening; during the Cold War there were a lot of similar 'proxy wars' between Russia and the US.  There's plenty of lesser options other than a direct hot war between two powers, and if both sides are willing to use that lesser option then so be it.  It's not like any other nations get to choose whether Russia is 'at war' with the West; it only matters whteher the two parties consider themselves at war.  From an international perspective, iirc I'd say that supporting one side isn't an automatic declaration of war, it IS a casus belli though - a cause for war; if someone is supporting your opponent then you're justified in declaring war on them.  Whether or not you choose to do so is still your choice though.",zlefin_actual,2023-06-01T09:22:10,1
"If Russia considers it a declaration of war, then that means Russia would be subject to facing armed forces from said countries. Russia's best interests are not served by Russia considering that an act of war. Russia would obviously prefer if those countries didn't help Ukraine, but what can Russia do about it? If Russia complains too much that this is war, and then takes aggressive action as a result, then Russia will just make more enemies, which Russia definitely doesn't want right now.",mormagils,2023-06-01T09:45:40,1
An act of war historically is defined when a country directly attacks and causes the loss of life/property for another country.   Russia has provided arms in Afghanistan and Middle East when it was in war with US but US didnâ€™t consider it act of war because Russians directly did not kill any Americans.   This is the main reason why Biden has not allowed any US armed troops to take part in the war and has cautioned that doing so will be considered world war 3.   Now supplying weapons is a different story -,curious_mindz,2023-06-07T20:09:30,1
"Thanks.  I was just curious if there are some standards, and you clarified that indeed there are, but also pragmatism is in force as well.",Sheshirdzhija,2023-06-02T08:31:35,2
"This is at the same time ""as expected"" and infuriatingly arbitrary. Like, obviously, they don't consider it a war because they don't really want to fight THAT war. But, arbitrarily, the line has been drawn at sanctioned direct foot soldier involvement. The line could be drawn ANYWHERE. It could be ""more than 100 soldiers"", or it could involve private independent volunteer soldiers. Strangest of all, logistics is a crucial part of war machine, yet logistics involvement is also fine, even though it's also ""sanctioned soldiers working against you"".",Sheshirdzhija,2023-06-08T01:19:56,1
