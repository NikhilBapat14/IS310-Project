The Democrats need a plan and a slogan. My personal favorite would be to work towards guaranteeing the basics to anyone who works 40 hours a week. ,ArcBounds,2025-04-28T00:34:04,13
">And in fact, Musk came in and just blasted right through it and made it a lot easier for them, and a lot faster. I certainly didn’t expect that. It’s not contemplated in the book or in the original document.”  The more I've been comparing what went down to what the P2025 people were recorded saying but didn't publish in the documents...   Elon fucked up the institutional coup they've spent a decade preparing for. The insurrection act they called off wasn't feasible.   They had people ready to fill positions in every department. Then boom, Elon wrecking balled it.  Their judicial attacks are preceding close to the plan,  but there's an attention and resistance on it that they wanted to already be beyond.",nerphurp,2025-04-28T00:16:24,13
"Brit here. America should be wary of listening to the Heritage Foundation, authors of Project 2025. Liz Truss's short reign as PM here in 2022 was marked by an administration heavy with their advisors. By all accounts her mini-budget was based on their advice. It precipitated a market fallout that threatened to decimate pension funds, sank the pound to its lowest level ever against the dollar, and forced the Bank of England to intervene to avert a wider crisis.  She was kicked out after 49 days, the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. Her premiership was the subject of much ridicule, including a livestream of a head of lettuce, where viewers were invited to speculate on who would last longer, Truss or the lettuce. The lettuce won.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Truss_lettuce#/media/File:Daily_Star_lettuce_20_October.jpg  Maybe America will get lucky and the same fate will befall Trump.",inthekeyofc,2025-04-28T05:17:42,7

"They could call it Project 1950... all most people want is what the boomers had. One person working one job 40 hours per week should be enough to buy a house, support a household, get an education and have healthcare.",-CJF-,2025-04-28T01:00:26,15

"I think for people like Vought, the gutting of federal agencies and theft of sensitive data is seen as the “tea party” for their “bloodless coup”. Musk realized that no one would expect something so lawless to happen, and no one would be able to muster a response fast enough to stop it, especially with Trump back in the White House. So he went full blitzkrieg on our most important institutions…and got away with it.  I hate this fascist shit, but politically/strategically it was brilliant. How does the left/center powerfully react? The Democratic Party is paralyzed right now as a unit. Sanders/AOC are building something that could be a new political movement, but it needs some sharper teeth.   We shouldn’t have to break the law to build an America that works for the 99%, but the darker this shit gets(child deportations, deporting kids with cancer, WTF!) the easier it becomes for the Trump regime to get darker. How do we stop it, starting now?  Another Reddit post regarding P2025 made one thing clear, Russell Vought and the Heritage Foundation need to be exposed for what they’re doing and plan to do. It really is a Handmaids Tale scenario that has begun. What they want is a white American dictatorship where women and minorities have no rights. They don’t want 1950, they want 1750.",industrial-complex,2025-04-28T08:57:30,4

"I grew up in a hard right household, went full left. My circle of empathy and trust is big enough to encompass people I don't know, and theirs is so small their immediate family barely fits inside. There's some research to suggest that there's a genetic basis for tribalist attitudes and preference for authoritarianism. Obviously your experiences play a big role in shaping which way you lean, but based on my own experience, it certainly feels like you initially come out of the oven with a bit of a natural tilt.",shellfish-allegory,2025-04-28T05:54:09,3

AOC and Bernie have momentum. I hope they can harness and shape something out of it. I don't know if anything is being done in that regard. After the failed Democratic campaign and the over reach of Trump we need a new direction. It would be healing to have a strong Independent party emerge.,Simpletruth2022,2025-04-28T09:24:42,3

"Yes and no. The post war boom was very likely also heavily owed to the massive amounts of government investment into the country. Infrastructure, industry, national programs… booms related to wars are interconnected with government spending at the root.  This is what Biden was starting to do again, and the economy reflected that. We simply have to defeat the idea that government spending is bad. It’s simply not the case. Never has been.",8somethingclever8,2025-04-28T07:25:25,2
"imho the biggest cause of income inequality is the tax system.   when GM was the world's largest company, they had like 2M employees.  Google has like 200,000 w 10x the market cap.  point is that companies don't hire as many people as they used to so wealth does accrue as evenly btw the shareholders and the employees.  shareholders and top execs take way too much of the pie.  given there are fewer jobs, companies really need to be taxed more.  the problem is that they can move their profits off-shore. instead of tariffs on goods, Trump really should be going after low income tax havens where companies are sheltering their profits and closing those loopholes.",Ask_DontTell,2025-04-28T03:02:39,8
