"Reminder that Republicans didn't care if PPP loans were repaid, many of them even got those loans themselves. BUT, student loans... that's a bridge too far.",2HDFloppyDisk,2025-04-29T15:25:48,26
"I suppose I can at least conceptualize the goal of reducing future loan limits. The availability of large, low risk government loans has been cited as a contributing factor for the rapid growth of tuition rates.  Limiting repayment options for current loneholders, however, seems dumb. Especially going into a recession.  Also, the requirement for 30 credit hours a year instead of 24 (which is currently full-time) is odd. Are they trying to prevent undergraduate students from extending their degrees to 5 years (which is common)? Why?",Nefarious_Turtle,2025-04-29T15:48:47,22

Not bad enough they sued to stop Biden from implementing broad forgiveness and his new SAVE program. They want people to be ignorant enough to vote for them and too poor to have any free time to think about how bad they're getting screwed by them. ðŸ˜…,-CJF-,2025-04-29T15:37:14,9
People who are chronically in debt are easier to control and exploit with meager jobs that are *just barely enough* to survive.

"So thousands of supposed ""radical left"" students indoctrinated by higher education will go into default and be forced to garnish their wages, only for Republicans to then pass legislation that further penalizes these students, perhaps even takes them to court, fines them and/or forces them to pay court fees, maybe even resulting in bench warrants or jail time.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-29T16:02:48,6

"They found a way to detach the crippling economy from the stock market. The news is nothing but terrible forecast for business. Short earnings. Higher prices. Lower consumer confidence. Yet somehow the market remains rather stagnant. Tesla, sales down 71%, trades higher.

"Education statistics have long shown that the number of people completing their first bachelor's degree in just 4 years is not a majority.  More than half take 5-6 years.   https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=569  >Additional data from the National Student Clearinghouse Research CenterÂ (NSCRC) shows that 60 percent of students who initially enrolled inÂ bachelorâ€™s degree programs in 2012 had yet to graduate by 2018. And while the statistics may vary by source and year, a vast body of research finds that most ofÂ Americaâ€™s undergraduates can expect to spend a minimum of five academic years in school.  https://www.insightintodiversity.com/the-average-student-takes-six-years-to-earn-a-four-year-degree-some-states-schools-and-organizations-are-working-to-change-that/",Nefarious_Turtle,2025-04-29T19:09:39,12
