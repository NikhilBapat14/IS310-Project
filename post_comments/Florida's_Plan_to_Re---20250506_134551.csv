"Let's put billionaires out there in jobs currently/ formerly held by migrant workers.     They're apparently worth the labor of a few hundred thousand/million people each. They should get it done okay through ""hustle culture.""",vucubcame,2025-05-06T13:51:35,1772
"## Summary:   The proposal came as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, touted using **teenagers as a replacement for the labor of migrants** who are in the country illegally.  If approved, Senate Bill 918 would have **removed restrictions on the number of hours** that 16- and 17-year-olds can work per week.  It would also have **scrapped required 30-minute meal breaks** and allowed children as young as 14 who are homeschooled or enrolled in virtual school to work **overnight shifts**.  Now the bill that would have **loosened child labor laws in Florida has died** in the state Senate.  Gov Ron DeSantis said: ""**I mean, that's how it used to be when I was growing up**.""",Aakash7aak,2025-05-06T13:54:04,661
"I 'WTF' out loud on this one. I mean, I ""wtf"" daily though this one is just absolute bat shit.  To think that this is a real issue for legislation and is being supported by anyone is beyond me.   This country has gone to shit.  When the various FBI Directors have repeatedly for years, if not well over a decade, have said that Russia and Right Wing Extremism are the biggest threats to our country? THis is why. It also feels like it's too late.   Florida used to be purple.. and it seems it's going to just continue as a red state.   >The proposal came as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, touted using teenagers as a replacement for the labor of migrants who are in the country illegally.  ...  >It would also have scrapped required 30-minute meal breaks and allowed children as young as 14 who are homeschooled or enrolled in virtual school to work overnight shifts.  >Under Florida law, 16- and 17-year-olds are limited to up to 30 hours a week of work when school is in session unless a parent or school superintend waives that restriction. They also cannot work before 6:30 a.m. or after 11 p.m. on a school day.  >The language in the bill came from staff within DeSantis' office, Orlando Weekly reported, citing records it obtained.  >The bill was approved by the Florida House in April, largely along party lines.  >However, the Senate version of the bill failed to advance before Florida's legislative session concluded on Friday.  > What People Are Saying > Republican state Senator Jay Collins, the bill's sponsor, said the measure was about parental rights: ""We should let them say what's best for their kids at 16- to 17-year-olds, that's what we're saying by this."" >  > Republican state Senator Joe Gruters said: ""I think we need to let kids be kids."" >  > Governor Ron DeSantis said during a panel discussion in March: ""Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when, you know, teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be able to do this stuff? … What's wrong with expecting our young people to be working part-time now? I mean, that's how it used to be when I was growing up."" >  > What Happens Next > The bill to loosen child labor laws in Florida is effectively dead, but it remains to be seen whether lawmakers will pursue it in a future session.  Seriously - this is so stunning in it's absurdity and how the whole battlecry of ""protect the children!"" Or ""What about the children"" when hey, lets let teenagers work over 30 hours a week doing hard labor while going to high school because we removed an entire labor force based primarily on racism.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-06T13:58:42,150

"It was called Undercover Boss. The CEOs of a company would go in disguise to work at that company at the entry levels, and they would only have the wages they earned to live on. So they would have to get a crappy apartment and ride the bus and do the whole experience for like a month, then at the end they revealed who they were and usually did nice things for the people they worked with, or fixed problems that they saw at the base level of operations.   But basically you'd see these rich dudes learn that the fry cook has a daughter with cancer or something and he's working 3 jobs and they get a taste of what REAL life is like for working people.   Some of the rich people really seemed to be changed by it. I remember there was one episode where \[son of the CEO\] is all smug about doing it, thinking it would be so easy, and he ends up Finding Out™ and at the end his comment was something like ""You know in my circles we say people are poor because they are ignorant and can't handle money, but we are the ignorant ones."" and he is choking out the words and getting really upset.That is the part of the show that really stuck with me.

"Look, as the economy gets increasingly desperate for the working class, sex ed is cut, and reproductive rights are rolled back, it’s important to remember that history repeats itself. A Modest Proposal solves two problems at once, the ultra rich can afford the other, other white meat, and for each baby sold to the rich the working class gets some income and has one less mouth to feed. /s",CaptStrangeling,2025-05-06T15:44:58,14
