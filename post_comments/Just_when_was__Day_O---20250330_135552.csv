"He also couldn't care less if seniors lose their social security benefits or make it difficult to even get what scraps are left; He couldn't care less about Veterans losing their benefits; He couldn't care less if housing and the cost of living continue to skyrocket; He couldn't care less about his fan base.  Trump has no need for any of the programs that his co-president/handler Musk is taking a chainsaw, so why would he give two shits about anyone else. This is what is *so hard* for his following to grasp.",LivingIndependence,2025-03-30T19:55:34,2
"The biggest problem we face is that the morons that voted for him believe that what he’s doing is in their best interests because they will stay misinformed. FOX NEWS plays on their television screen 24/7 and that propaganda machine will NEVER tell them what’s really going on in the real world or why what Trump has in store for them is not only horrible for the nation but is equally as awful for them in the near future or down the line.   Scumbags who run that network don’t believe in the prosperity of the country, they only know what’s good for their own pockets.",redtape73,2025-03-31T00:13:05,2

"I know sooooo many people that bought into this little myth... ""He's going to bring that inflation down... "", ""We need to get him back in there, he's really going to fix things..."" and, my favorite, ""My hamburger and fries are now double what they were when Biden took office, Trump is going to fix that...""   I kept on saying, ""He's a used car salesman...""... nobody cared...",_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-04-02T10:52:19,1

"And when confronted to explain who is responsible for literally anything, it will always be Biden’s fault. Seriously, some doctorate student somewhere could write a solid thesis on the mental gymnastics they always pull",Voglio_Caffe,2025-03-31T15:01:11,2
