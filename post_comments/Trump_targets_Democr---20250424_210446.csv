Weaponized DOJ. absolute clownshow,ScubaSteveEL,2025-04-24T21:07:02,47
"I hope ActBlue spams the DOJ emails with requests for a $3, $5, or even $20 donation to help defeat the Republicans in November.",Constant-Abalone-522,2025-04-24T21:27:05,24
The DOJ has become Trump's personal vengeance agency. He wants to make people afraid to create fundraising organizations for Democrats. Nothing like trying to stack the deck in the GOP's favor.,invalidpassword,2025-04-24T21:33:03,19

Mr. Quid Pro Quo suddenly concerned about fundraising?,CockBrother,2025-04-24T21:24:36,4
"But large corporations with the blessing of the “Citizens United Act” exist with impunity to donate as much money as they want?  Quick read on Wikipedia, and I heard some criticism,  Act Blue does not seem out of line, and is way less shady then inaugural donations and bribery and extortion that seem currently popular with Trump heading the executive branch.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-24T22:00:02,6

ActBlue aka the fundraising arm of the corporate democrats that fumbled the 2024 election. Sucks to suck. ,shanjam7,2025-04-24T21:37:58,-33
So you’re in favor of weaponizing the DOJ against political enemies?,twerk_store,2025-04-24T22:36:51,11
I’m a small donor that happily gives to ActBlue,Got_Frogs,2025-04-24T22:04:32,10
