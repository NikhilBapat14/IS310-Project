">“We’ve been asking this question, but now what are they doing illegal?” one Texas Department of Public Safety officer asked.  >“What?” asked another DPS officer.   >“What are they doing illegal now? What if this was after a game or something? This many people \[are\] out … after a basketball game. We do this after the Aggie games?” the first officer asked.   >“No,” the second officer replied.   >“All right, let’s shit or get off the pot,” a third officer said.   >“**We’re going to do it so they won’t get agitated**,” a fourth officer said.   It seems like *Brandenburg* pretty much guarantees a win for the students here.

"I was banned permanently from r/news because I questioned a guy who called someone organizing a pro Palestine protests to be doing terrorist activism. Everyone should know that they organized those protests because of the genocide in Palestine committed by Israel.

I wrote this to him: ""Can you explain why the genocide in Palestine by Israel is so important that you think it is terrorism to speak out against it?""   The guy I replied to is now permanently suspended from reddit and I haven't reported him. A mod from r/news replied when I appealed that I needed to grow up and learn how to read.

Well, I’m a Jew on my mother’s side and grew up with the religion and culture and I was certainly a student. I don’t see it as pro Palestine being pro Hamas.

I don't think there is a mod list public for r/news and I have no idea of which moderator I'm dealing with. Last time I wrote back on the appeal I got a mute from a moderator that made me unable to contact the moderators from r/news for 7 days.  My comment was indeed passive aggressive because of the comment the other guy made that I thought was stupid. But as you say it isn't unusual or violate any rules to make passive aggressive comments.  You can judge for yourself:   [https://imgur.com/a/VykqPcv](https://imgur.com/a/VykqPcv)  The deleted comment in the first picture is where my comment was.

"> Stopping Hamas can only happen if and when Hamas organizes free and fair elections that will lead to their demise?   … what? When did I say or imply anything of the sort??   > Are you suggesting that the Palestinian people are incapable of a forceful resistance to free themselves from Hamas’ control?    Okay. Now I’m leaning towards disingenuous. Because I could copy paste my original response and it would be equally fitting. Do you understand that the Palestinian people **don’t have schools or hospitals anymore?** Do you understand that there are two major armed groups and one is Israeli forces and the other Hamas? Half of Gaza are **literal children.** This isn’t comparable to any revolution you’re vaguely gesturing at.    >  I don’t mean to underestimate the extent of the threat that Hamas posses to Israel, but the situation is something like the circumstances that allowed a monster like Harvey Weinstein to exist.

Do you understand collective punishment is a war crime?
