Is there a good write up anywhere that has a list of all the facts surrounding this Garcia situation?,Lame_Night,2025-04-16T15:37:09,79
Has he tried suing in district court? I'm sure there is some district judge willing to hold the El Salvadorian VP in contempt if he doesn't grant access.,macfergus,2025-04-16T15:49:36,483

Why is a us senator advocating for some foreigner who broke our immigration laws. Aren’t there Americans he should be worried about. Was this visit tax payer funded?,Graardors-Dad,2025-04-16T15:39:46,369
So he had to fly down there at taxpayer expense just to be told the same thing the El Salvadoran president already said pretty unequivocally when he was at the White House?,Frescanation,2025-04-16T17:03:33,53

So let’s get this straight. The man flew international to El Salvador (Probably Biz class) on tax payers dime without a meeting or a plan. Nice way to piss tax payer money away. I’m sure he is staying in a 5* hotel for the weekend too.,FLHawkeye10,2025-04-16T20:48:38,13
This guy is such a tool bag he should be primaried as soon as possible. He never called Rachel Morin’s family nor have I heard him advocate for the prisoners held by Hamas. Yet here he is pandering for a non US citizen who can’t vote for him even if he was still in MD.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-16T17:34:55,19

He has no right to visit another country's own citizens in prison. This man has lost his mind.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T15:22:19,9
"He likely knew that would be the case. The fact he waited to ask means he wanted the ""optics"" of this. Which is hilarious.    He wants a US judge to have jurisdiction over El Salvadorians who are in El Salvador.    Does it get any more colonial than that? Cancel this fuck for being an imperialist if anything.",rasputin777,2025-04-16T19:18:05,7

"Neither VanHollen nor Alsobrook, MDs other senator advocated for Maryland mother Rachel Morin. In fact, they haven't said a single damn word about her getting raped and murdered by yet *another* illegal alien. Van Hollen is a virtue signaling piece of shit.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-16T17:04:56,7

It’s simply an attempt to keep his name in the media. He isn’t relevant and is doing his hardest to have some spin. He’ll be forgotten in a few weeks,1BroadLyte,2025-04-16T17:45:43,1

I don't remember him visiting the family in his state which recently lost their mother at the hands of an illegal immigrant. Did Rachel Morin's life not matter to Hollen?,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-16T15:42:31,2
