So much time and energy wasted on this bullshit. I literally cant wait for the giant meteor to take us all out.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-05-07T11:31:25,99
"I am shocked that this is in Salt Lake City, that's like Mormon Vatican city. Maybe it's more liberal that I had thought.",4thdegreeknight,2025-05-07T11:57:31,38
"This is a perfect example of left vs. right. This has been sold for months that the state banned LGBTQ+++++ flags in any government building, without making any mention that it also banned ANY non-government flag, including the Gadsden Flag, Confederate Flag, and any number of other divisive symbol.  The right: Yeah, good idea. Public buildings shouldn't be giving bias to any particular group.  The left: Fascism! If we can't fly these special group flags, we will make it our official city flag! You will conform.  I hope that even moderate democrats can see the dangerous precedent this makes.  Edit: Looking through the comments makes it very apparent that this is a WILDLY unpopular move by the mayor and city council.",the_house_from_up,2025-05-07T21:13:19,7

I hate these radicals so much,ghost-ns,2025-05-07T23:20:28,1
"Going to the effort of making your city flags represent something like who people want to be with - and who they want to fuck, is sort of getting away from the entire focus of local government.  I say be with whomever you want, minus kids. I say fuck whomever you want, so long as this is consensual and of legal age.    Butter to promote it in your own city flag?   Thatâ€™s not what government is for.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T14:08:38,24
SLC is much more liberal than the rest of the state.,squunkyumas,2025-05-07T12:00:19,62
"It's all virtue signalling. It has to be. Because if they actually solved problems, what would they have left to campaign on???",Vektor0,2025-05-07T19:51:52,5
"Giant waste of fucking time, energy, money. Perfect description for all of govt these days.",Basic_Lunch2197,2025-05-07T14:10:35,20
I have only been there once on a layover but I had assumed it was very very Mormon.,4thdegreeknight,2025-05-07T12:01:02,11
"Oh, no doubt the whole state is heavily Mormon, but SLC is kind of like Atlanta in GA - since it's the one spot of major urban development, that's where you find the most progressive cultural elements.
