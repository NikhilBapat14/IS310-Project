">Is increasing the debt ceiling sustainable?  Yes, as long as the raising of the debt is smaller than inflation and/or the rate of economic growth. So currently it is not sustainable.  >Are we in a flawed system?  This would depend on how you define a ""flawed system"".  >In reference to the raising of the most recent debt ceiling, it seems like the democrats are the ones that want to spend more money.  This is a common line of thought, but Republicans have shown they have little appetite to actually cut the budget. It turns out government spending stimulates the economy, and citizens generally like the services provided by the government. Republicans, even when they are in control, never pitch large spending cuts and in fact pitch tax cuts which increase the debt.  To realistically eliminate the deficit (or significantly reduce it), it will likely require a bipartisan effort to strategically eliminate/increase spending while sensibly raising taxes.  >So for example if they want to overspend by $1 Trillion USD, what's stopping them from overspending by $100 Trillion USD and giving us even more benefits?  The magnitude of the debt. Let's take an analogy.  You want to buy a house. You can go to a bank and get a mortgage for more than you can make. You only make $100k/year, but you can get a mortgage for $500k. This is because you can reasonably make those payments. If you go and try to buy a $100 million house, the bank would decline to provide you money because they don't think you could reasonably pay it back.  Same with the government. The US government issues bonds to make payments. If the government issues an extra $1 trillion annually in bonds, investors are still reasonably certain the government can repay it, as they make $22 trillion in GDP annually and continuing to grow. If the government tries to issues $100 trillion in bonds, many people wouldn't buy them as they'd realize that's WAY more than the government could actually pay back.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-05T09:45:00,3

"The debt ceiling is like a credit card limit. It has nothing to do with the budget, it's about how much we can borrow.  When Trump ran into the debt ceiling, there was no debate because Trump spent too much money which pleased democrats, so they upped the debt ceiling. This also gave them more money to spend when they got back into power.  When Biden proposed his budget and all his spending increases, he knew there wasn't the revenue to pay for what he wanted, he knew he was putting in the federal credit card, and he knew the spending cap was in place. He chose to not stay withing the constraints put upon him and assumed he could automatically raise the credit limit.  You could have made the argument a few years ago that the debt has little cost becuase of the low interest rate. That would have been short term thinking because now that the interest rate has risen, we are paying too much in interest. WE are nearing paying $1 Trillion on interest. Non on health care, not on anything helping US citizens, $1 Trillion a year lost becuase we can't spend responsibly. This is not a democrat or republican problem, it's an everyone problem.

"\#1. Our ability to ""sustain the debt"" depends on our ability to sell the Treasuries needed to get the cash to run the government, If GOPers were serious about reducing the debt or the deficit, they'd back restoring the preReagan tax structure, collect the additional $1.7Trillion that is currently going entirely to increase the wealth of the top 10% and use the surplus to pay down the debt. In short, Republicans are the only reason the debt and deficit keep growing and their only solution is to eliminate all programs that benefit the bottom 90% at least as much as they benefit the top 10%. tRump added 25% to our 200-year-old debt in 4 endless years, $2Trillion of which went to the top 1%, $350Billion going to the top 90=99% and everybody else seeing a slight increase in the effective rate they pay or a loss of government support or services they once had.  \#2. Yes - Since 1980 nearly $7 Trillion in wealth and over 90% of all gains in income have gone to the top 1% while the bottom 20% went from increasing their wealth by 4% each year to seeing their real income and wealth SHRINK every year. the middle class (about the middle 2 quintiles) which had been home to 65% of Americans has shrunk so today only 30% reach that benchmark in their standard of living. The ONLY solution is to end the Reagan taxscam and restore the brackets that prevented the ones who divide the profits from keeping it all for themselves. then end the Republican deregulation of the financial sector so banks are no longer unregulated casinos playing fast and lose with other people's money.  \#3. That is an outrageous LIE. Republicans have agreed with every deficit budget we ever racked up, and Clinton was the only President in living memory who had a budget SURPLUS for two year in a row. jrbush and the GOPers in House and Senate turned that $350BILLION surplus they got from Clinton and turned it into a $1.7TRILLION annual deficit. Reagan TRIPLED the National Debt with an absurd increase in military spending for stuff the military didn't want, cut the top 1%'s effective tax rate from 40% to 18% while increasing the average American's effective rate from 7% to 12% while eliminating virtually all support to higher education causing the spike in tuition that is making higher ed the province of the very rich and the very indebted. Reagan entered office with a National Debt of $829Billion and left office with a debt of $3.757TRILLION, an increase of 354%. jrbush entered office with a budget SURPLUS of $350Billion and a Debt of $5,807Trillion, which he increased to $11,907Trillion, or 105%. President Obama added $8,838Trillion or 72% to the Debt in 8 years while stuck with the two worthless wars jrbush lied us into that sent $5Trillion down the sandhole. The POS tRump added $9.3Trillion or 29% in 4 years. President Biden has cut the tRump dificit by over $1.4TRILLION.  So if you consider actual FACTS and not the lies spewed by the GOPerLords trained media, you can see its REPUBLICANS that have creaded nearly 80% of the National Debt while redistribution TRILLIONS in income and wealth from the bottom 90% to the top 10% while shredding the social safety net for the bottom 80%.",Olderscout77,2023-06-07T10:55:52,0

"Raising the debt ceiling simply allows the government to meet its existing financial obligations. It's sustainable if balanced with proper fiscal policies. As for the system, it's not perfect, but it's ours to improve. Politicians overpromising benefits is a symptom of a deeper issue - the need for electoral and educational reforms.      The debt ceiling isn't about new spending, but paying for what's already approved. There's no exact limit to overspending, but extreme overspending could lead to economic troubles like inflation and a damaged credit rating.

"No, the OP neglected half the equation. Debt is not a result of too much spending. It is a result of spending *exceeding revenue*.

Not to say the country couldn't benefit from a little rethinking of its spending (*cough*defense budget*cough*) but it is the axe that the GOP keeps taking to the revenue side of the equation that keeps creating the bulk of the deficits/debt ever since Reagan.",gcomeau2013,2023-06-06T23:45:33,2

And the debt ceiling wasn't raised without debate under Trump because Democrats like spending, it was raised because the Democrats don't play that idiotic game of ""let's put a gun to the head of the economy to get some stuff we want from the other side"".
