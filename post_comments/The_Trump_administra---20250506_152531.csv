"Two possibilities: either the pharmaceutical companies got to them first, and pharmaceutical lobbying is no jokes. Or the people in the admin finally realized that if they do this, the number of out of wedlock children in the republicans camp will EXPLODE",Automatic-Wonder-299,2025-05-06T15:30:55,16

"article states that this lawsuit is effectively trying to challenge the FDA's authority to decide whether the drug is legal, because the states want to make it illegal. A proposed theory is that Trump is dropping this case because if he can get the FDA to make it illegal, this same ruling would allow some states to declare it legal. So basically losing a battle to win the war.",modulusshift,2025-05-06T15:49:41,10
Who did Trump get pregnant?¬†  He is always self-serving. ¬†So the question is only partially sarcastic‚Ä¶ or maybe its for a daughter?,Ugh-screen-name,2025-05-06T15:35:22,8
"Huh. That's... perhaps less surprising than one would think. Part of the right-wing playbook is heavy use of uncertainty. If you can make someone less than certain that you'll take a particular action, you can make doing that action a little more likely to be successful, since that uncertainty can delay opponents' maneuvers to defeat your planned action.   It's similar logic to the ""token black guy"", where nearly all of a white person's friends are white, except for one black person whom the white person trots out to display how said white person isn't a racist.  ""See? We can play nice about abortion stuff, really! Just trust us, bros!!1!""",takingastep,2025-05-06T15:32:13,4
"I tend to believe that this may be a first serious political calculation coming out of Donny's little brain since ""build the wall"". He apparently understands that anything other than ""absolutely nothing"" that his administration does with regard to abortion means near certain defeat for GOPs in the the coming midterms. So, he'll want to appear to be measured and moderate for now... and will save the pitchforks and torches till after the midterms.",phosdick,2025-05-06T15:46:16,4
"It's abortion pills access for white rich Christian Nazi Republicans males.  Others can just travel to another state and get their abortion... But they don't have the money, so the GOP will be happy to give those poor kids and parents a jobs in a China style sock factory.  It's about cheap labour and freedom for the top 1%.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-06T15:38:00,3

"Trump asked Marla what she wanted to do about fetal Tiffany, so abortion is definitely an option Trump supports - for himself.",10390,2025-05-06T16:18:00,3
