Trump rarely thinks before speaking but if he can convince his base to accept his lie (not hard sadly) he is free to reach out to Xi (which he absolutely will have too) under the claim that he is just calling China back.  It was absurdly stupid to get into this type of argument with China though.

"Lawful evil (I'd saw LN personally) looking like a real big improvement right now over what we have. Not just from Trump, but just at like...infrastructure, urban planning, and ability to deliver level.  I used to live in Austin, a metro of over 2 million without a functioning ring road/beltway. Commuting was miserable and often took hours for what should've been basic trips. A beltway was approved ages ago (I want to say in the 1980s?) and they built three sides...but homeowners complained so much that they never actually closed the loop. So Loop 360 is neither a loop nor 360.

As an Asian-American, I often visit family back in Japan or skip over to South Korea and marvel at much better so many things are (yes, I'm aware there are downsides). Less trash, better urban planning, healthcare, stronger government intervention in basic infrastructure planning, higher infrastructure standards, lower relative costs, etc... Those societies are still democracies, but they're also less free than ours in some ways and they're more used to a strong government. Obviously China isn't my idealized country and I'd much if America went in the Japan/SK direction. But there are definite upsides to a country that just gets things done at the expense of some liberties, e.g. homeowners not being able to block practically everything to preserve their property values.",Sminahin,2025-04-28T09:29:00,2

"Just want to be clear here. Singapore is not a democracy. On my own personal Dem-Authoritarian spectrum, Singapore is the siren song tempting me away from Democracy with alluring education standards, urban planning, and general efficiency. I wouldn't go for it, I value democracy and human rights, but good lord is it tempting. In contrast with much of America, where Russia/Belarus is the authoritarian temptation along their Dem->Authoritarian spectrum. I have much better taste in selling out freedom for benefits.  And yes, I am fully aware of the internal politics and the many issues with Japan and South Korea. That is not my point, but even then I would honestly take problems like those over current America problems in a heartbeat. My focus is on those societies' drive to just get things done in a way that our country/states/cities just don't.  I've spent most of my life living in American cities where absolutely nothing gets done building/improving/maintaining infrastructure for literal lifetimes. Often because homeowners and HOAs whine. Sometimes because the city & state need to re-review the plan a good dozen times so that 20 years later we've only managed to pay a few analysts/specialists to review. There are definitely ways in which Asian & East Asian government can be completely dysfunctional, but this sort of planning & delivery is one front on which they often put us to shame. And that front is the most important thing for everyday QoL in my opinion. Makes me definitely crave a L society over a C society.
