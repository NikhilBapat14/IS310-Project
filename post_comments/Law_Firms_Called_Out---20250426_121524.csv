Devils advocate maybe all of these law firms are planning on throwing these cases.

"A lot of partners in transactional practice don’t remember anything of constitutional law from their law school days nor do they care much for what “constitutional means”. There was a partner in the Denver office of DLA Piper LLP (one of the largest, if not the largest, law firms in the world) who, a few weeks ago, posted on LinkedIn something to the effect of: “I don’t know much about the constitution, but all I know is that my local playground feels a lot safer since Trump began deporting illegals.”",KinkyPaddling,2025-04-26T15:33:44,121
