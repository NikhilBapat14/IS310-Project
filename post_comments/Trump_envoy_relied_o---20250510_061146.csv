"Even if we are to believe that Trump is in leagues with Putin, this absolute trust he has with the Russians is almost childlike. I'm sure even China doesn't go this far because they know they could be screwed over.",Rosebunse,2025-05-10T06:59:26,22
This must be a special 'Art of the Deal' tactic employed by Idiot Trump negotiators who have zero experience in diplomacy.   That Nobel Peace Prize Obama got still keeps haunting him.,YallerDawg,2025-05-10T08:23:17,7
"This administration can't even be called clowns, because at least clowns have some self respect and pride in the job they do.",JustinKase_Too,2025-05-10T09:51:38,6
This is wild lmfao  Never forget this president during his first term went in front of the world and said he trusted Putin more than U.S. intelligence agencies. I‚Äôm still not quite sure how he was allowed to stay as president beyond that day.,FinancialRabbit388,2025-05-10T10:40:51,6
"I trust Vladdy 100%. In all the years that I've know him he's never told me one lie. Yes I rely on his interpreter because he suggested we do it that way to save the US some money. Putin pointed out that's one last person the American taxpayers have to be paying for.   Biden and Obama told us lies about Putin, that he was a dictator and a bully, that he stole from his people and imprisoned anybody who spoke out against the country. I have found just the opposite, that he is more kind-hearted and generous and whenever I needed money in the past only he and his rich friends would loan me the money. Plus, whenever I came to Moscow, he would find me the prettiest women and never charged me one ruble. Putin is a true patriot and a great ally for the United States.  /s",TopEagle4012,2025-05-10T07:14:05,3

Can‚Äôt have any American in there to catch Trump getting his instructions,Boxofmagnets,2025-05-10T08:00:38,13
"He also seized the notes from the interpreter and there was talk of that person being subpoenaed.   This is so much better. Not only do they save money, they also don‚Äôt have to worry about any notes or subpoenas!",specqq,2025-05-10T16:39:47,1
