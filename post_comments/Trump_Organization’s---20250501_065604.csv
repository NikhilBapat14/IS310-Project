If you’ll recall correctly the main thing was his drug addiction and how open of a threat that was to America since his dad was president…  So to remedy that issue Republicans elected Mr. Grab em by the Pussy who in turn allowed Musk to bribe him to the tune of a quarter billion that we know about. End result is a ketamine and coke addicted Nazi was granted access to confidential information. ,3MATX,2025-05-01T07:29:06,10

"OK, I actually had to research this because the boomers upstairs were complaining about Hunter Biden every day but had no idea why they were mad at him when asked.  Back in the Obama era Ukraine was trying to become a NATO member, and as a fledgling democracy they still had problems with corruption. There was a natural gas company called Burisma in Ukraine that was being investigated for corruption, and Obama and Joe Biden both bragged about firing the person investigating Burisma.  The supposedly horrible part is that Biden had pulled some strings and had his son Hunter installed as a higher-up in Burisma. It was a very cushy job where he didn't really have to do anything, and was pulling in a few million dollars a year.  So the scandal is that Biden got his son Hunter a really cushy high-paying job that he wasn't qualified for in Ukraine, and then fired the guy investigating the company for corruption and then bragged about it.  The thing is that they fired the corruption investigator ... *for not investigating hard enough.* The investigator was not doing his job, and Obama and Biden were proud to remove him. Fox News conveniently leaves that part out. And yeah, it kind of sucks that Biden can get his son a high-paying job just because he's vice president... but Trump hired his whole family to *run the United States government!!!!* Not to be a whataboutist, but that's a bit of a double standard.  Then there was the whole Biden laptop thing. From what I understand he had left his laptop at a computer shop and the Republicans or the FBI got ahold of it. They hacked into it and Rudy Giuliani went around telling everybody it was full of emails proving corruption by Joe Biden and his family. Marjorie Taylor Greene even took some of the nude pics he had on his hard drive and waved them around at court as though it was the worst thing possible. Trump himself blew the story out of proportion claiming it was the ""laptop from h\*ll"" and was hoping it would be the ideal October Surprise.  The Republicans launched a ton of investigations into the laptop and dragged Hunter Biden's name through the mud for *years*, and Joe Biden made a point not to intervene in any way. After years of public humiliation at the gleeful cackling hands of the Republicans, in April 2024 their own investigation committee revealed that they didn't have any evidence of corruption or wrongdoing by the Bidens.  But they did find that Hunter Biden applied for a gun without completely filling out the application form so they persecuted him to the fullest extent of the law and he went to prison for that, and were he not Joe Biden's son, there's no way he would've been punished for that beyond a simple fine.  And yes, Hunter Biden had a history of drug abuse earlier in his life that he struggled with, but with help he was able to overcome his addiction and is now clean. Furthermore, Joe Biden publicly said that he acknowledges his son's shortcomings but he's still proud of him for overcoming them.  (Sorry this is long)  And finally, last year, after saying for the longest time that he would *not* issue a pardon for Hunter, Joe Biden issued blanket pardons for Hunter, along with a slew of other folks. This raised eyebrows because 'If you didn't do anything wrong, why are you getting a pardon?' Well, nobody's saying that now that Trump's gone full dictator, are they?  Anyway, that's what I remember from having to research the whole Hunter Biden argument. Haven't gotten to use that information against the boomers upstairs yet though.",Character_Value4669,2025-05-01T10:51:51,2
