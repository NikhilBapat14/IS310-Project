"I'll leave you with this. Try not to vomit.  Some excerpts from the cabinet meeting held today to mark Trump's 100 days of dazing Americans.   1. Attorney general Bondi: ""President, your first 100 days has far exceeded that of ANY other presidency in this country. Ever. Ever. Never seen anything like it. Thank you.”         2. Treasury Secretary Bessent: “Sir, it’s been a momentous 100 days with you at the helm. And I view this 100 days as setting the table for peace deals, trade deals, tax deals, the next 100 days we’ll be harvesting.          3. Interior secretary Burgum: Everybody I’ve met, whether it’s at a coal mine or the border, law enforcement, the one thing they say is please thank President Trump from all of us — the change that you’re making.”         4. Wanna-be Genghis Khan Elon Musk: You know, the American people voted for secure borders, safe cities, and sensible spending. And that’s what they’ve gotten. Tremendous amount has been accomplished in the first 100 days. As everyone has said, it’s more than has been in any administration before, ever, period. So this portends very well for what will happen for the rest of the administration. I think this could be the greatest administration since the founding of the country.”         5. Secretary of defense, Whiskeyleaks Hegseth: “Mr. President, you inherited a demoralized military that couldn’t recruit, that was perceived as weak after what happened in Afghanistan and elsewhere because of Joe Biden. And what we have seen since your election and the inauguration has been nothing short of a recruiting renaissance. Decades, it has been decades since we’ve seen this kind of recruiting in the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the men and women of America want to join the United States military led by President Donald Trump.”         6. Vice President/Resident Couch fucker J.D Vance: “You sit in the Oval Office and you see these portraits of Presidents past. And let’s be honest, most of them have been placeholders, they’ve been people who have allowed their staff to sign executive orders with an auto pen instead of men of action. And the reason the media attacks this administration as chaotic is because the President is solving the problems the American people set about to solve. He’s actually doing the things that he promised that he would do. And Mr. President, it’s been an honor to be part of it for the past 100 days.",Buttfulloffucks,2025-04-30T15:19:00,5
