Undermining elected Dems isn’t “rocking the vote.”  Dems need at least 3 seats to flip the House. All our time & money should be spent on swing districts and state legislative races that will give us the majority.  Spending $20 million in trying to win a House seat in Idaho would be stupid. Spending a dime on challenging an incumbent in a safe seat would also be stupid.  Plus the Senate will be way harder to retake than the House but we should pull out all the stops to do it.

"From Hogg's perspective, guns are really good at ending multiple people in short order. In about 200 years, no gun has ever been used in America for any purpose besides target practice, hunting and ending small groups of people, mainly individual American citizens.  What does *American Hitler pulling people off the streets* have to do with owning a gun?  A: Absolutely nothing. Whatever you're alluding to, it's a non-starter.  Here's why: Andrew Jackson would randomly challenge his political opponents to gun duels while indigenous people marched in the Trail of Tears, which he executed in violation of the Supreme Court. What good did it do then, before the US had one of the most powerful, most well-funded militaries in the world, serving at the pleasure of the Commander-in-Chief? The one who won two pivotal elections by a free-voting public? In a country where Police services buy surplus military equipment including *APCs*?  They're creating an ""autism"" (i.e. general medical status) registry, they're jailing American-born citizens, they're ignoring the court they stacked and still can't win against, they're sending notices to leave the country to American lawyers *by accident*, and they are kicking out the Associated Press for using the word ""Mexico"" while inviting the least informed podcaster they could find to the press pool while suing historically trusted news institutions into compliance. They're punishing schools for not teaching to the President's standards, revising the history pages, and they're fucking up your economy, possibly forever and certainly for millennials and younger, including Hogg. Even third-rail politics, like social security, are getting attacked. And it's happening all at once.  The Republican Party learned fifteen years ago that change happens in the local races and through raising new leaders to understand the game. They understand that change, seasoned with fear-based manipulation, happens through the system.  But hey, at least you can own a gun.",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-24T08:53:22,-1
"My point is that power-yielding old-guard Democrats are wrong and Pelosi is wrong when that's the entire depth of reason she can offer for undermining the next generation of Democrat leadership. One product of this failed leadership was Schumer's decision to grant the Trump administration an unquestioned pass on the budget.    Hogg is passionate and is attempting to take the reigns in order to spur leadership change. And he's right - the Democrats are age-heavy and failing to prepare new leaders, and have lost votes because reps have died in office. I've criticized the Dems as a dying party while also describing conservatism as a dying political idea. I think Sanders recognizes this - he's on the road with AOC for a reason - but largely the only way for the party to survive is if there are leaders, and if the current leadership won't handle this, then the options for the younger generation is to let it die or to take it up themselves. ",CitySeekerTron,2025-04-24T06:45:32,4
Think further ahead.   David Hogg wants legislation passed that would ultimately be used by fascists like Trump to disarm vulnerable groups that are being thrown into foreign prisons right now.   How you think gun control is the right message right now is just beyond me. ,hillbillyspellingbee,2025-04-24T08:14:45,4

"If you hear gun control and think it's just about banning guns, you're listening to the propaganda and not the real message. Banning guns isn't gun control, it's just control. Gun control is funding mental health care and removing the stigma of needing mental health care. Gun control is providing opportunities to low income areas so that they don't feel the need to need a gun in the first place. Gun control is providing help to young mothers so that they can continue their education. Gun control is sex education in schools so less kids have kids. Gun control is a lot of things, but it's easier to demonize the mentally ill, the poor, and kids that have sex/children.

"Conservatism is dead because there's nothing left for it to try and conserve. It's no longer about old traditions, and it's not about maintaining power structures. It's now about growing and deepening those power structures.  Traditionally, conservatism used to be about maintaining the status quo and tamping change. Today, where conservatism once walked, right-wing revolutionaries are running: people who want to change everything radically. Yes, there are elements of what could be conservatism within their ranks, but it's mainly for branding. The Democratic Party as it exists today is what might be characterized as centrist conservative, while the ""party of limited government"" is attempting to legislate social behavior and healthcare from the executive from a further right, authoritarian perspective.  I fully expect that there are conservatives who won't vote for Trump and the like, and I also expect that there are people who vote for the current-day GOP but will deny that Trump's doing shit in plain sight because they either don't think it would be permitted (""Nobody would actually let him do those things!"") or because they think he's trolling the left (""He's just saying this stuff for attention"").

You can't meet them halfway, because they always go straight to ""Democrats are banning guns"". Even if the Democrats in question like guns, own guns, and target shoot for fun. It's always ""Democrats are banning guns""",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-24T08:12:30,3
"Like I said, propaganda.",ChoiceHour5641,2025-04-24T07:07:25,2
That was a lot of words without any details. Let’s remember that Crockett is in Texas.,cincocerodos,2025-04-24T12:29:49,2
"I encourage them all to take up the sport, the sooner to expose Republican hypocrisy. I'm sure we will see gender dysphoria as a disqualification for owning guns if this gets popular.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-24T08:51:27,2
"Well the thing there is gun show sales are sales between two private individuals inside a state, and the federal government has no authority to control commerce inside a state.  So right off the bat trying to regulate that at the federal level is going to take you to the Supreme Court arguing the authority of the commerce clause and good luck doing that with this court.  If that’s something you want to focus on it really has to be at the state level and states are all over the place on how strict they are about sales between residents inside the state. In PA I can sell one of my AR15s to anyone who’s proven to me they’re over 18 and a PA resident, pretty loosey goosey, handguns have to done through a FFL which includes a background check just like if you were buying a new gun.   And the democrats ban gun narrative works because they’ve tried to do it every chance they’ve had. That’s a feeling built up over years and does not go away at the snap of a finger.",felis_scipio,2025-04-24T08:35:29,0
How the fuck is voting on bills that ban guns propaganda? It’s literally the only purpose of the bill and every time the democrats have been able to they’ve tried to pass that type of legislation,felis_scipio,2025-04-24T07:28:02,1
I do not feel safe being in the same state as some guy over 18 who bought an AR-15 from your kitchen window. Those things aren't as concealable as handguns but the history of mass shootings show that they are much more deadly in terms of crowd killings.  A lot of European countries are actually pretty gun-happy but they have background checks to keep guns out of the hands of mentally unstable people. So gun owners can enjoy their guns and the rest of us can enjoy not being perforated by a schizophrenic that you met on Craigslist.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-24T08:38:55,2
"And if you want to see that changed you have to bring it up with your state level reps, spending effort on that at the federal level is just a waste of political capital but that hasn’t stopped federal level democrats from doing it.  Now let’s look at how many mass shooting were committed using weapons legally purchased, hint it’s a lot, meaning a background check was done. If this is an issue you really care about the first thing you should focus on is figuring out how background checks can be improved.  After that you’ve got weapons that were stolen, either directly from someone the perpetrator knows or bought illegally from someone else who stole a gun, and the question there is what regulations could be put in place that would meaningfully reduce that. Make background checks a year long investigation and you’re not going to stop that flow of guns.",felis_scipio,2025-04-24T09:28:45,1
"So many guns around is why there are so many stolen guns around. People buy them on a whim, never use them, leave them under the bed, and a burglar nabs them.  I'm not a single-issue voter so the gun thing is stupid but not what I'm phoning my reps about.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-24T10:00:53,1
