"I've said this many times before; polygraph tests are pseudoscience. They've been around for a hundred years and still aren't admissible in court anywhere in the world due to how unreliable they are. They exist as an interrogation tactic; because while they can't be used as evidence against you, the things you say while being administered one can; and your belief that they work can rattle you.  Threatening employees with them is either nothing more than a means of intimidation, a means of information gathering from someone so far removed from being qualified for this job that he isn't aware of these facts, or both.",Grey_0ne,2025-04-26T03:51:29,222

No matter what your job is in the military you are given this information repeatedly. Like seriously. REPEATEDLY.

"Personally, I think the actual reason why they are still used during the vetting process for these Federal agencies, despite the very clear evidence they are prone to inaccuracies and are generally unreliable as a “lie detector”, is less about accurately detecting deception from the prospective employee, but gaging how well they handle themselves and keep their composure during high-stress/high-pressure situations. I don’t think they are looking at the results to see whether or not you lied when answering one of their questions since there’s such a broad margin of error to be considered a reasonable approach. I think what they are interpreting from the results is how you are physically/emotionally responding to the inherent stress of the situation. They can’t determine if you were lying; they know that, but they can see that your heart rate was going crazy when asked basic questions and were freaking the fuck out for a majority of the interview. And if you can’t handle that, you probably aren’t a good fit for the job since if hired, you will be expected to remain calm and be capable of functioning with a high degree of mental clarity and composure in way more high stress/high stakes situations than a polygraph interview.",Money_Mousse_4743,2025-04-26T12:25:51,3

Re-read my edited comment. That isn't all the person was saying. The person is actually taking a dump on the testimony of a 13 year old rape victim.  And no; it wasn't that he failed the polygraph test. It was that he reneged on his guilty plea by claiming later that he was innocent. Most courts will come down on you for that as a violation of your plea agreement. The results of the lie detector were used in court to hammer the point home because his allowance of the lie detector results were a condition of his initial plea agreement - that he had already violated by claiming his innocence after the fact.,Grey_0ne,2025-04-26T09:20:58,1
