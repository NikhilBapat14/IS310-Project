"""Fluoride is a neurotoxin"" in high levels, yes, fluoride is neurotoxic. But this is very disingenuous. And that is VERY high levels, not anywhere close to what is in the drinking supply. There's formaldehyde in pears (the fruit, that grows on trees)...but you don't see people avoiding pears because formaldehyde is a neurotoxin (which it is).  Fluoride in low doses is good for dental health, and because we have the most dogs/cats in the world, our vet bills are lower as well.  There is an argument for 'medical consent' here, should we have the option of taking what is essentially medicine when we drink from our water supply. I understand that argument, but don't necessarily agree with it.  What about putting more fluoride in toothpaste? People are stupid and don't brush when they should in the first place, and vet bills will go up (no fluoride in water for dogs/cats, less healthy teeth for pets).  It's an interesting conversation, but at the end of the day the 'fluoride is a neurotoxin' argument is stupid, and having fluoride in the water supply provides measurable physical health benefits to people and animals alike. Until someone comes up with a truly better option, I don't see why we should change it.",SideWinderGX,2025-05-01T08:06:13,1710

"I thought this was r/conservative not r/conspiracy .  Fluoride’s primary benefit is topical, when it is present on the surface of the teeth. But there is some systemic benefit during tooth development, but it’s limited and mostly relevant in young children.   You can call me a ‘fellow conservative’, you can call me a ‘concern troll’, but I’m just trying to go after the facts. Why does science have to be political? I’ll admit that big pharma exists, and that they don’t always have the best in mind for you. But fluoride has been around for 75 years, well built on plenty of research.  mRNA vaccines rolled out in just under a year with ‘decades of research’ apparently.  The flu vaccine took over a decade to develop.  I’m just here to uncover fact and conspiracy.

I mean the toothpaste package says do not swallow. You're not supposed to swallow fluoride.   We will not drink tap water because of this.

"Even if you support fluoride being used to prevent tooth decay, and I think there is evidence to support that, why not use it as a topical additive such as in toothpaste and at regular dental cleanings? Different children drink vastly different amounts of water, so fundamentally by putting it in the water supply the government is just giving a random dosage. My kid could drink 100 ounces of water today because it's a long day of soccer practice, or they may have close to none because they stuck to apple juice and milk.  The arbitrary dosage alone is enough for me to know that putting it in the water supply is a bad idea, not to mention the fact that we should never trust the government enough to medicate us via the water supply as a general matter of principle.

"How about fluoridated water bottles. Then you can buy it at Costco if you *really* want your fluoride.  I'm 100% against adding medication—as you describe it—to anything where it becomes essentially unavoidable.  Life by default should be ""pure"".  While not exactly an apples-to-apples comparison, I think this still has some of the same considerations as with smoking tobacco.  We banned smoking near business entrances, so that others that don't want to inhale tobacco are protected and the ""pureness"" of the air is maintained.  If you want to smell smoke, go to the smoking area outside. If you *don't* want to smell smoke, you should not have to *DO* anything—you should be able to just live your life without giving a thought to whether or not tobacco smoke will be in the air you're breathing.  Clean air is the default.  By that same token, **clean (pure/unmedicated) water should be the default**.  Want medicated water?

"I am against it because the data only shows that it improves health of teeth by about 10% while the measures of its negative effects are hardly measured at all. Genetics can greatly vary the effect of any chemical introduced in the body, so okay, 10% benefit from it, there will be those who don't benefit from it at all, and there will be those who develop anxiety in part due to fluoride exposure (that is one of the effects of fluoride). No one studied that when they started dumping this into our water.  There are so many times in history we plow ahead with things having closely measured the good effects (whether they are negligibly good or very good) but only then measured the acute bad effects. If fluoride caused mass death soon after practicing fluoridation the water, obviously they have stopped it. But what if it just caused anxiety in like 5% of people and that didn't really manifest until their teens, long after they had been regularly exposed to fluoride? No one would attribute it to the fluoride because of the lag time in the effect manifesting and because it is not acute enough an issue, nor does it affect a large enough population.  But fuck those people, right?   Wrong. It's one thing to give people acetaminophen and they voluntarily take it, knowing there might be risks down the line that they could test for when first testing the drug.

"No, ""science"" has also investigated the brain development implications. 1.5 mg/L is the level where they measured developmental damage. To be cautious, they say for every additional 1 mg/L above 1 mg/L is drops an additional ~3 IQ. The US fluoridates at 0.7 mg/L which is less than half the level where they've measured developmental loss at.  Over the period of time we started fluoridating water, IQs increased by about 3 points a decade from a baseline of 100 in 1930 to ~115-120 in the 1990s. Note that this means that a score of 100 in the 1990s is equivalent to a score of 115-120 in 1930.

"Judging by your flair I think we would disagree on a lot of things haha, but to be fair, you raise good points. In a purely or reasonably free society you should choose these things for yourself and for your family.

Then where do we draw the line...what else should we put in the water supply (vitamins/creatine)?  For what it's worth, creatine has health benefits that have been tested on everyone from infants up to geriatrics, and when taken in reasonable doses (like everything else), muscle strength/stamina/cognitive function all increase, across the board. Why are we drawing the line at fluoride and exclude other things?  Personally I don't want my health insurance paying for someone else's terrible decisions.

"I didn't really want to respond to any of these comments (some of them are good) but yours compelled me to.  First off, this is not an echo chamber, so you can fuck right off with your gatekeeping. You've got some uppity, know-it-all attitude but not enough knowledge to back it up. If you knew half of what you thought you knew, you'd be a genius.  Secondly, sodium hexafluoride is poisonous and is NOT what is used to fluoridate the water. Your claim is just wildly incorrect.  Thirdly (looking at your other posts) there have been ZERO studies done that show the amount of fluoride in US water supplies lowers the IQ of children.

"Who is the ""you"" in ""cost you more in the long run"". That assumed a collectivist and pro-nanny state position. You are referring to all of us as a nation and suggesting that we should all just accept this because Papa government is looking out for us. That isn't a conservative stance.   The government also told us diets that had a high carb foundation were good for us for like 60 years, that is true for maybe 5% of the population. Papa government told us it was good for us though.   Even if fluoridated water provided a measureable good for our oral hygiene, by just flooding the system with it, we can't possible study it's negative effects. A Chinese study found that fluoride also reduces intelligence by about 7 IQ points. Conspiracy theorists say it makes people docile, and while I take conspiracy theories with a huge grain of salt, reduced intelligence would have an affect on the populace. Fluoride is also associated with depression and anxiety when developing fetuses and young children develop while exposed to it. Guess what we have today? A depression and anxiety epidemic. Is that all fluoride? Of course not, there are many factors contributing to it, but fluoride is proven to as well. And according to some estimates, mental health care expenditure last year was $238.4 billion while dental care expenditure last year was $174 billion. A 10% increase in dental expenditure would not put it higher than mental health expenditure. This is obviously more complicated than I'm making it out and it is impossible to accurately measure the effect of fluoride on either the totality of dentistry care nor of mental health care but these numbers should make you think.  If I want my water fluoridated, I can fluoridate it and receive all those purported benefits to my teeth. We have no idea right now how genetics even affect differences. Fluoride might help your teeth and do nothing for mine, while it causes me anxiety and you feel fine on it. How is that fair? How is that reasonable. My tax dollars don't need to force fluoride down all our throats when we don't even know the full effect of it. We only know the effects are not acute enough as to cause a panic or to be easily attributable to fluoride.

">. If you are a US citizen, and you are actually poor, it's 100% because of your bad personal choices.  I totally agree with you 99%❗️  But there is that 1% (or even less) where life just took an unfortunate turn.  One example is having an undiagnosed medical condition that destroys your ability to work.  Again it's just an example.  But my point is that  - and I agree - poverty is a state of mind - not of circumstance.  The social safety net (right now) to me is too large and was not designed to support folks who can work but choose not to.  Unfortunately the Leftists and communists have corrupted all of our safety nets to the point where this country is bankrupting itself into 3rd world status.",GiediOne,2025-05-02T08:30:01,1

"How did they get to power? They didn't get elected, nor were they choosen by the parliament. At least kim jun un gets elected every year no matter what lol. Hes a president not a dictator for that reason don't look behind the curtain of false elections. Meanwhile the only reason hes in power is by blood so is he a king? His sister a princess?  I will give you this, no the monarch in most cases have little power but they are still the most influential house in the country they reside. England still makes the monarch choose the prime minister granted its after a vote for political party but its still a position of power that is gets decided by someone rather than the country itself.  I won't touch the middle east monarchs as thats an issue of itself and those are the kinds of monarchs we actively should avoid.",Katzchen12,2025-05-01T12:37:55,18

The exact same way all that excess water is exiting the body.

"Just because they weren’t elected doesn’t make it a dictatorship. Especially when the concept of a dictatorship has specific requirements to reach and monarchism doesn’t fit that. Oh right, yeah great, he gets elected through sham elections so he wouldn’t be a dictator. I guess a dictatorship is only when he’s hereditary is your argument? So you just admitted monarchies generally are constitutional, have checks and balances like the Republican US does, and this is still an issue for the fact he has any degree of power? Oh I get it every position needs to be electable then within government, so cabinet for that matter should be directly elected by the populace along with basically anyone in government with power",just_one_random_guy,2025-05-01T13:03:24,-7

"Man you missed my point of bringing kim jun un into this by miles. My point is a title is a title. Perspective is what makes a title actually mean something. Since it seems like you need some help here, the monarchs in europe and for that matter middle east are generally accepted and so yeah great they can keep their titles as nobles above the people. My main point in this whole argument though is at the very least a republic is the right way to govern. And back to what started this chain I would support a libertarians views more than someone that thinks a monarch is a good idea.  No not every position needs to be elected as long as their role isn't something major like selecting the leader of the country... Still wild to me that I found someone that thinks a monarch has any place in modern politics.",Katzchen12,2025-05-01T13:29:06,5

As if that had anything to do with what I said? I really couldn’t care less if you don’t value my opinion because I’m a monarchist. Thanks for sharing that little factoid with me. Yeah, because valuing a monarch for cultural reasons along with having a stable non-partisan figurehead paired with an elected government is soooo much crazier than libertarianism as a concept",just_one_random_guy,2025-05-01T13:36:24,-1
