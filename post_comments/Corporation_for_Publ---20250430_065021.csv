"Basically, Trump is attacking NPR and PBS via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).   The president, regardless of party affiliation, does not have the authority to remove any of the CPB's board members.  Article snippet:  > The CPB distributes more than $500 million annually to public broadcasters, primarily to local television and radio stations. PBS and its stations each receive, on average, 15% of their revenues from the corporation; NPR stations receive 10% of their funds from the CPB while NPR itself receives about 1% directly from CPB. (NPR receives a bit more indirectly because local member stations pay NPR for the right to air its programs.) >  > Under the law that created CPB more than five decades ago, the president has the authority to appoint members of its board, in consultation with Senate leaders of both parties. >  > The law does not, however, establish any authority for a president to remove them. As the CPB lawsuit notes, that law does not include the clause common to U.S. government agencies that its board members ""serve at the pleasure of the President"".",progress18,2025-04-30T06:58:53,7
