"This doesn’t matter anyway. It’s neither here nor there. This man is so racist that in his first term he made it abundantly clear how he hates everyone. He gave permission to the rest of the racist nation to treat one another like garbage. And so they did. They all came out of the woodwork then and won’t stop just once to realize they are wrong. Now he’s back in office and they are still running rampant.   He didn’t need to give them permission to break into peoples homes, they were gonna do what they want anyway because of removing the  J6 punishment. As far as they are concerned it’s break in arrest and apology later. The fckn damage is done.   The only way around this is if we make them suffer consequences for their actions and I mean immediately.   The articles of impeachment should’ve come sooner and by God I hope it’s a sobering experience for the right.",brenawyn,2025-04-28T19:05:13,5

Masked men breaking into homes without badges or warrants. What a great time to get into home invasion as a profession.,johnnyhandbags,2025-04-28T17:48:31,1
"Hmmm, first secret memo and maybe next secret police? The politicization of DOJ, ICE, FBI, Homeland Security and DOD is surely on a slippery slope and may be the first step leading to the creation of Soviet-style internal security secret police agencies like the KGB and Stasi. They recruited people to spy on each other, turn each other in, and just ""disappeared"" people for claimed political disloyalty who were them either dispatched to a Lefortovo prison or gulag (like Gitmo?), or even worse outcome. It must not be allowed here.",Own_Entertainment847,2025-04-29T09:12:31,1

"Not enough to occupy the United States. To effectively occupy the USA (20 soldiers per 1,000 civilians) youd need 7 million troops. Including every single soldier AND cop its still only around 3.2 million. Are you saying that there are an additional 3.3 million white nationalists able to bolster that number? Not even taking into account the idea that soldiers would balk at working with meth heads with swastika tattoos?",PloddingAboot,2025-04-29T05:10:07,0
"First: You’d need 7 million troops to effectively occupy the United States (military wisdom is 20 soldiers per 1,000 civilians) even including every single troop that we have ALONG with every cop, being generous that is 3.2 million, so not even half. Throw in that USA is HUGE, the population is armed and generally unaccustomed to harsh authoritarian rule you cannot effectively declare martial law across the United States. This isnt even getting into supply, support, resistance, defection, insubordination etc etc etc.  Second: Martial Law in the United States when it has been declared in areas has always only been to enforce civilian law. Demanding soldiers to start treating their countrymen like insurgents and occupied enemies is likely a recipe for mutiny and disaster.  I’m not saying things cant get bad, but getting worked up and sapping energy on a scenario that is so unlikely is grossly unproductive.",PloddingAboot,2025-04-28T12:22:23,4

They’re also not considering the advances made in drone technology. A single drone can monitor a 20 square mile grid with a camera so powerful it can follow a single person wherever they go.   The old rules for warfare don’t really apply anymore. Add in rapidly advancing AI and we’re most likely in for some scary times.,Sharticus123,2025-04-28T15:06:34,1
