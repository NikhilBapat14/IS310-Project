"Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson received a standing ovation on Thursday after denouncing the Trump administration’s “relentless attacks” on federal judges, calling them a threat to the rule of law.  “ Across the nation, judges are facing increased threats of not only physical violence, but also professional retaliation just for doing our jobs,” Jackson told a conference of judges in Puerto Rico. “And the attacks are not random.

Note that the power of judicial review is not stated or described in the Constitution, yet it was SCOTUS’ decision in Marbury v. Madison where SCOTUS’ decision granted and affirmed their role as final interpreters of the constitutionality of government acts and thereby creating the concept of judicial review.  What stops them from doing so is their own restraint and the worry about setting a precedent for future cases and future SCOTUS.

"A Supreme Court Justice speaking out may be seen in time as another step  to give people more confidence in active protest. We don't know where this will lead. At some point it may move to protest in the streets up to the point of civil disobedience, with just cause against an authoritarian govt.  It has echoes of the civil rights movement of the 60's.  Back then unjudicial arrests, violence were common, including on American citizens willing to stand for justice. It was a brutal fight and took enormous courage from so many. Eventually the civil rights movement won in many areas, but in what was definitely an unfinished fight.    That kind of civil rights disobedience and bravery is hard to contemplate undertaking for anyone. People with a lot more historical knowledge of the USA will know a lot better than me what it took, and what helped to foster the courage. Part of it was belief in the cause, but there was also action by different govt officials with different levels of power, right up to Robert Kennedy sending in the national guard.     At the moment there isn't fully a sense of that backbone from people in power, and it's not at the stage of encouraging people to take to the streets in far more active civil disobedience, opening themselves up to serious attack like in the past. It may come though as this govt's attacks and move to authoritarinism is moving at an exponential level - only 100 days in.      We are also in an entirely different age of Trump and social media, but it's still similar in so many ways to past citizen uprising, when justice and due process is painted as crime, and crime and corruption is painted as just 'business' in plain sight.         It needs more but a more active movement can't be ruled out as coming,  and a Supreme Court Justice speaking out may come to be seen as part of a big step.

That's a form of intimidation, often used by dictators with small penises to ensure that they instill fear with other judges that will take up cases.

They also do ""original jurisdiction"" (you can take things directly to SCOTUS under some circumstances) but in no case does SCOTUS just re-dedecide thing without a specific case and two litigating parties in front of them.  Of course, this doesnt imply that you have to just wait for those cases to emerge organically.

"My reading of Brown II  supports my assertion that SCOTUS doesn't take up issues without an issue being brought to them by parties with standing.   I'm a little confused because honestly, I think that's what you're saying too?   Brown II was a continuation of Brown I and involved exactly the same large set of plaintiffs.   SCOTUS set up Brown II as their closing for Brown I, ordering the parties to re-appear in front of them during the following term to discuss the specific mechanisms for desegregation,  resulting in their ""all deliberate speed"" decision.   It was basically them wanting to split the complex issue up over sessions.    As you say, this was a clarifying decision that was an extension of Brown I, dealing with the same parties.",mjc4y,2025-05-02T19:27:31,1

"I’m saying that Brown II is the only time in history that SCOTUS has ever given another ruling as a “continuation” of another ruling. BUT that there’s no Constitutional or legal limitation on SCOTUS being able to do so.  Yes, it is true that SCOTUS doesn’t decide to rule on legal issues without a case making its way through the appellate system OR unless it’s a case dealing with a dispute between the individual states and disputes between the federal branches.   And yes it is true that SCOTUS decisions are generally considered final and once a decision has been made on a case and the issues at play in that case; it has always taken a new case (or set of cases combined) where plaintiffs issue petition for certiorari from SCOTUS for SCOTUS to take on the legal issues again and generally the legal questions in the writ have to be different from that which was in the preceding cases.  But this tradition isn’t a *rule* as you said in the first comment I replied to. It’s a norm that SCOTUS has set and followed for itself. But there’s nothing barring SCOTUS from revising or re-viewing a past case and issueing another ruling. I used Brown II as an example.  Brown I, plaintiffs for Brown (it was a combined case with multiple plaintiffs) wrote and sent a petition to SCOTUS - their writ of certiorari. And SCOTUS granted the writ, agreeing to hear arguments and ultimately made their ruling.  For Brown II, there was no new case nor new writ of certiorari, asking SCOTUS to review the previous decision or a new legal questions about the previous decision.   Instead, SCOTUS unilaterally decided to issue a new ruling, Brown II, giving instructions on how states were to comply with Brown I. So in this case, SCOTUS “re-reviewed” their own ruling without prompting from plaintiffs petitioning for certiorari. There’s no other case where that has happened; but this example shows that there’s no *rule* against it.  Edit:  > They can't just go over past work and reconsider things.  That's not how the rules work.  To overturn an existing supreme court ruling, there needs to be a case in front of them.  That means someone with standing would have to bring a case up through the federal court system and then appeal those decisions all the way to the Supremes… We could really use a control-Z on this one, but sadly, our USA 1.0 app doesn't have that feature.  That was your comment I replied to. As I said, there are no rules (constitutionally or legally) about SCOTUS overturning or re-reviewing a previous SCOTUS ruling. Brown II can be thought of as exactly that - a re-review. For Brown II, there was no new case brought up through the federal courts. SCOTUS just realized that states were refusing to comply with Brown I and the NAACP and others were complaining about such. But even without a new case, they issued Brown II.",RandyFunRuiner,2025-05-02T20:20:31,1

"""because its not like anybody cares about whats happening to people like me.""     This is exactly why we are in this mess, huge swaths of people saying ""nobody cares about me, so I'm only going to act in my best interest"", it's the entire basis for MAGA. Here's the thing, there are LOTS AND LOTS of people that do care, that want to help and make lives generally better for everyone, but the work they do is spun negatively by misinformation and bullshit media outlets like Faux News. Don't fall into that mindset, people care about you and what is happening to you. And as much as I want MAGA supporters to feel the crush of everything that's coming their way because of their voting, I don't like seeing lives get ruined. There's going to have to be a lot of hard work and creative solutions for a lot of people in the coming months and years if we keep going down this path, hopefully we can find a way to move past the MAGA movement and not revisit this bullshit anytime soon.",SnukeInRSniz,2025-05-02T12:04:13,1
