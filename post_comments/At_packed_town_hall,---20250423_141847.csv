"> As the audience roared approval and drummed their feet on the gymnasium’s bleachers, Schiff told voters to “continue to take to the streets to make our views known, to make our voices heard, to tell those in power that we are watching what they’re doing.”",drtolmn69,2025-04-23T14:19:37,10

Who's the one that needs to declare that a constitutional crisis is official?  The Chief Justice?  The Speaker?  How will we official know?,dbag3o1,2025-04-23T15:11:20,1

"Wow this article is a fucking mess. I was there. There were multiple hundreds of people and the event was scheduled for the performing arts center which sold out.   There was a line through the whole campus who turned out. They had to open the gym up as overflow. The senator and congressman addressed the PAC with a live stream to the gym for 1 hour and then did another hour at the gym after that.   The picture they used is from way after it was supposed to end after many had left.   Schiff answered some harsh questions around Gaza and the Democrats failures, but most of it was questions regarding due process, tariffs, and attacks on Universities.",KindaStableGenius,2025-04-24T03:27:57,1

Why Schiff called no witness in Trump senate trial? We did not need to be where we are if Schiff had done his job prosecuting Trump.,Agnos,2025-04-23T15:11:13,-4
"There is no constitutional crisis. There are people upholding their oath to upholding the law of this land & there are people pretending that the entertainers, speakers, and spambots they contracted can magically change what is written.

"youth support for trump is cratering rapidly. most young people are at universities, which are currently being targeted. I agree that there has been an outsized prescence of older folks at town halls and protests, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing",Disgruntled-Cacti,2025-04-23T15:45:57,1

"And as the captains gazed south to the Land of Mordor, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell.",HireEddieJordan,2025-04-23T14:40:32,1
"I see this differently.  I think the relative lack of young adult participation in the resistance is a big problem.   Most of the youngish people I know (20-30's) are either so pessimistic/depressed that they don't bother to do anything or they feel no sense of urgency (despite being very well informed) and don't bother to do anything.  Maybe they expect their helicopter moms to  come save them? In either case the result is the same.    I think we need more youngish leaders.  AOC is doing what she can, we need more like her.",10390,2025-04-23T17:18:01,1
"Given the two groups that increase support the most in 2024 for Trump were young men, followed by young women, I'll believe it's cratering when they show up at the polls for Democrats next year.",atreeismissing,2025-04-23T20:25:34,1
"> Republicans, who controlled the Senate, voted 51-49 AGAINST calling witnesses in the trial. Facts are things  Yes, and Schiff let it slide instead of taking it to the public...I HAVE NEVER SEEN A TRIAL WITHOUT WITNESS OR DOCUMENT!

"Or it’s that you get type-casted as a know-nothing starry-eyed activist who hasn’t done anything to earn anything. Everybody (besides a top few) are losing something under this administration, but my generation feels like it has little to gain. The system being rigged is a common perception and there are young people out there, but they have both less to lose in an immediate financial sense and more to lose in an environmental and long-term sense. The lack of immediacy and disconnect is definitely felt. I think it’ll slowly reverse and once the immediate grocery/price shocks occur, you’ll see more normies on the street besides the college educated. We just haven’t lost our 401Ks or retirements yet.  edit: It makes sense to see those who have practiced a democratic citizenship (i.e. voting) longer to protest in these cases. Younger people are more likely to protest in social causes",Inquisiting-Hambone,2025-04-23T17:56:45,6

"Since you demand only perfection, do any of these fit your definition of perfection since all of these are being done by multiple Democrats, in addition to town halls:   * holding nominees up in committee * blocking votes in the House (and all but 1 in the Senate) * organizing and attending multiple protests which have brought millions of people out * have helped with over 200 lawsuits against Trump * won most special elections so far * are busy doing media appearances to help inform and educate people * going to El Salvador to try and bring Garcia and the other 250+ prisoners home * going to the immigration camps in Louisiana to check on prisoners and work to get them released  I'm sure there's more too, does any of that count?",atreeismissing,2025-04-23T21:50:48,2
"I get that it's human nature to ignore consequences that are too far removed from the acts that could be taken to mitigate them, but I am gobsmacked at the lack of concern for so many open and outrageous wrongs:  the assault on the very existance of transgender people, the fact that people are being illegally abducted by masked officials and sent to foreign concentration camps without a hearing, etc.    But as you suggest, people catch on at their own pace.  Maybe now that autistic people are being singled out and also threatened with forced encampment more will feel personally threatened and act.",10390,2025-04-23T18:24:58,2
