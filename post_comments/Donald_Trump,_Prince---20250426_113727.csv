At least it’s not a tan suit. That would be so unpresidential!,RadialWaveFunction,2025-04-26T11:39:44,27
That’s Ok at Trumps funeral were all going to wear rainbow colors 🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈,rom_rom57,2025-04-26T14:12:56,16
The felon doesn't own a black suit. He wore a blue for Ivana's funeral as well.,TwistedMemories,2025-04-26T13:25:55,10
">""For men, dark suit with a long black tie and a button of the same color on the left lapel of the jacket, where only Vatican honors can be placed. For women, a black dress, preferably long, of the same color as gloves and veil on the head, with the only allowed ornament being a string of pearls.  >""These are the prescriptions for those attending the Pope's funeral, according to well-established protocol manuals that also define the seating arrangement for dignitaries and heads of state.""  He did it on purpose to get attention and as a petty way to annoy others.",J-Midori,2025-04-26T12:35:18,27

Trump is a vulgarian. I would expect nothing less than disrespect and trying to make himself the most important person at a funeral.  It would be news if he didn't make an ass out of himself and the country he represents.,Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-26T13:01:12,5

"He definitely did it for attention.  Biden wore a blue tie.  The president of India wore blue.  Zelensky no tie. Prince William,  blue. Trump was trying to stand out, but if you look at the whole crowd, he wasn't exactly uniquely dressed",stegna,2025-04-27T09:41:39,2
Or he may have done it on the advice of secret service to make sure he stands out. He's in someone's crosshairs I'm sure with all the inflammatory stuff he's done. Probably more than the other people there.,enigma002,2025-04-26T15:27:06,-14
This is such a pathetic complaint about trump lol. They’re a picture and probably 20% of them had on a blue suit. One guy even had a purple jacket. ,luckyluchianooo,2025-04-26T22:39:10,-10
"They did and it was quoted in the article.   Political strategist Joey Mannarino commented on X to his 613k followers: ""Trump at the Pope's funeral is just exuding complete and total class. Absolutely the image America should be projecting to the world.""",rbourbon,2025-04-26T14:28:40,1

Eh it's a funeral ? Usually one does everything to show respect for the dead rather than themselves at such an occasion.,joseywhales4,2025-04-26T16:52:55,17

"He knew he was going to be in the front row. You can see everyone in the front row is wearing black and blends in. He could have chosen a darker suit that matched Melania.  Like you said, Biden was well dressed and followed the code. There are pictures of Trump sleeping and some articles say he was the first one to leave. Again, Biden is older and showed more respect than Trump.",J-Midori,2025-04-27T19:53:49,1
Shouldn't secret service know where he is anyway? They'd be nearby to him.  I don't think secret service would do rooftop security for something like this. It was probably done by Italian or Vatican security services.,other_usernames_gone,2025-04-26T19:00:49,6
"Yeah, him and every other world leader that had to attend the funeral. All politicians have enemies. He's not special. He's just a fascist.",StevesRune,2025-04-26T22:03:17,6
"I mean, that'd also make him stand out. Like critical mass in a sea of black.  Your argument makes no sense.  Also, it's a fucking suit. The pope don't care-he's dead. I wore a sweater and blue jeans to my dad's funeral, again he's dead-he didn't have a problem with what I was wearing.  It seems like just one more thing he wanted to get in the headlines for.
