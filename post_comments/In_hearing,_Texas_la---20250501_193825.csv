">A lawmaker pushing to ban non-human behavior in schools says he based his bill on a conversation with a school administrator, who has since denied so-called furries are a problem in her district.  >During an at-times tense hearing Tuesday night, Republican state Rep. Stan Gerdes said he filed the bill after hearing “reports of the presence of a furry” in a Smithville school. He said he called the district superintendent in November, who told him *“this is happening in districts across the state”* and schools don’t have the ability to stop it.  >*“We just want to help them have the tools to get some of the distractions out of the classroom so we can get back to teaching time,”* Gerdes told the House Public Education Committee.   >But the Smithville school district issued a public statement last month disputing Gerdes’ claims. It said Superintendent Cheryl Burns told Gerdes there were no litter boxes on campus for use by students dressed as cats, but as a courtesy to the lawmaker, she *“made the extra effort to walk the campus to confirm.”*  >*“At this time, the District has no concerns related to students behaving as anything but typical children,”* the statement said.   >Still, Gerdes argued the legislation was needed to curb the “extremely concerning” trend while providing scant evidence furries are a problem, or even present, in Texas schools.  >Both Gov. Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows have backed the “Forbidding Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Education (F.U.R.R.I.E.S) Act,” which would prohibit any “non-human behavior” by a student, including wearing animal ears or barking, meowing or hissing.   >The [bill includes exceptions for sports mascots or kids in school plays](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB54) and would only apply to grades 6-12. Still, it includes a clause that would amend the family code to deem schools “allowing or encouraging” a child to “develop a dependence on or a belief that non-human behaviors are societally acceptable” as child abuse.   >The furries trend has existed for years, at least among adults. Many like taking on animal personas, dressing up in costumes and attending gatherings. The annual Anthrocon convention in Pittsburgh draws thousands.   >Rumors about classrooms adapting to child furries appeared to start online in 2022. School districts in Iowa, Michigan and Nebraska later debunked claims they were providing litter boxes in bathrooms, and the fact-checking team at PolitiFact could not find any credible news reports that supported the claim.  >Under questioning from a Democrat on the panel, who cast the bill as part of a “smear campaign” against public schools, Gerdes could not point to a single example of a school providing litter boxes to students.   >Gerdes, a two-term legislator and past aide to former Gov. Rick Perry, said his office has received “some reports of them.”  >*“Did I go to these school districts and visit and see it with my own eyes? No,”* Gerdes said.",UGMadness,2025-05-01T19:40:18,7

">When Gerdes introduced the legislation last month, he said he fully expected members of the subculture he was targeting to show up at the Capitol “in full furry vengeance” when the bill was heard.   >*“Just to be clear — they won’t be getting any litter boxes in the Texas Capitol,”* the Smithville Republican said in a press release announcing the bill.   >But there were no so-called furries or litter boxes at the late-night hearing Tuesday. Instead, the four people who showed up to testify against the measure included a public school teacher and a Texan who worried the measure could affect students with disabilities.    >State Rep. James Talarico, a Round Rock Democrat who grilled Gerdes on the legislation, called the bill a “joke,” but said it would have serious consequences for educators. Teachers and schools could face fines of $10,000 to $25,000 for allowing behavior prohibited by the bill.     >Talarico questioned whether a student licking their fingers after eating Cheetos would be prohibited by language in the bill, which defines “non-human behavior” as “licking oneself or others for the purpose of grooming or maintenance.” He asked whether students reading “Animal Farm” would be flouting the law if they made sounds like the characters in the book.   >Gerdes said neither would meet the intent of the bill, and said he would be open to working with Talarico on the language to make him more comfortable with the legislation.   >*“I'm not comfortable with any bill that's going after a non-existent issue,”* Talarico responded. He cast the bill as part of an effort by Republicans to undermine public schools.  >*“Governor Abbott has used this litter box rumor to paint our schools in the worst possible light,”* Talarico said. *“That's because if you want to defund neighborhood schools across the state, you have to get Texans to turn against their public schools. So you call librarians groomers, you accuse teachers of indoctrination, and now you say that schools are providing litter boxes to students. That's how all of this is tied together.”*  >Gerdes denied the accusation. Later in the hearing, state Rep. Jeff Leach, a Plano Republican, defended Gerdes as a supporter of public schools and cast Talarico’s opposition to the legislation as part of an “obsession” with the governor.  >*“His hatred for Gov. Abbott and for private school vouchers or educational savings accounts has just gone too far,”* Leach said. *“You’re highly respected,”* he told Gerdes, *“and this bill doesn’t change that.”*  >The committee left the measure, House Bill 54, pending. ",UGMadness,2025-05-01T19:42:35,8
