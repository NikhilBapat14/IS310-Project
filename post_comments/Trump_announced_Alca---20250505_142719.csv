"In the bizarre rambling answer he gave when asked about this today, he did seem to mention ""the movies"" three times... it seemed like he was referring to the movie... it's hard to tell exactly cause he no longer talks like a fully functioning adult.

Ik this isn't proof that he did it because of tv but it doesn't help things. He has never uttered alcatraz before and suddenly he wants to open it back up for some reason?  He is cutting billions worth of things we actually need and is tossing it at random weird shit. We don't need fema or money prepped for natural disasters. No need for disease prevention and monitoring. What we need is military parades and opening up old outdated prisons.   He is insane.

"IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN I THOUGHT:  >During an Oval Office press conference on Monday, the president was asked why he decided that he needed to resurrect Alcatraz as a prison after it had been shuttered for decades, prompting Trump to deliver a rambling response that included him touting his own cinematic vision.  >‚ÄúWell, I guess I was supposed to be a moviemaker,‚Äù he declared, adding: ‚ÄúI mean, it represents something very strong, very powerful, in terms of law and order. Our country needs law and order. Alcatraz is, I would say, the ultimate, right? Alcatraz, Sing Sing, and Alcatraz, the movies. But it‚Äôs right now a museum, believe it or not. A lot of people go there.‚Äù  >Referencing the flee attempt by Morris, alongside brothers John and Clarence Anglin, the president said that ‚Äúnobody ever escaped‚Äù but ‚Äúone person almost got there.‚Äù In the president‚Äôs telling, though, ‚Äúthey found his clothing rather badly ripped up‚Äù and full of ‚Äúshark bites.‚Äù In the end, Trump described Alcatraz as representing ‚Äúsomething that‚Äôs both horrible and beautiful and strong and miserable \[and\] weak.‚Äù  Lol it even ties in the fear of sharks he developed from watching Shark Week.",Desdam0na,2025-05-05T14:52:37,384

Alcatraz is, uh, I would say, the ultimate, right? Alcatraz. Sing Sing and Alcatraz. Eh, the movies. But, uh, it's right now a museum, believe it or not, a lot of people go there. It housed the, uh, most violent criminals in the world, and nobody ever escaped. One person almost got there. But they, as you know the story, they found his clothing rather badly ripped up. And, uh, it was a lot of shark bites, lot of, a lot of problems. Nobody's ever escaped from Alcatraz. And just represented something, uh, strong having to do with law and order. We need law and order in this country. And so we're going to, uh, look at it. Some of the people up here are going to be working very hard on that. And, uh, we had a little conversation. I think it's going to be very interesting. We'll see if we can, uh, bring it back in large form, add a lot. But I think it represents something.

We had asked to reschedule the appraisal because the entire household was sick with covid on the day of but she declined which is how we learned about most of her personality. So instead we decided to roll with the punches. We tidied as much as we could and didn‚Äôt focus as much on cleaning/disinfecting, didn‚Äôt wear masks, and mom made it a point to ask the appraiser if she noticed the soffits? Did she see the eaves? Stbx was supposed to handle the water damage repair in these rooms but failed to do so. He was also supposed to handle the siding repair/replacement after but didn‚Äôt do that either. See all the missing panels? Oh and most of the windows don‚Äôt open either and are missing screens courtesy of the previous owners. She claimed to have not caught all that and then started looking more closely at everything.

The irony is that the movie depicts the 1962 escape which eventually led to the closing of the prison due to decay and cost in 1963.  They escaped because the sea and salt air made the concrete brittle enough to use small metal objects to strip away concrete around an air vent in each cell.  They all escaped through the service corridors to the roof.   It is literally the one of the reasons Alcatraz was seen as being unfit as a prison anymore.,TintedApostle,2025-05-05T17:26:13,4
