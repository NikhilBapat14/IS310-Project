Australian checking in: the right wing candidate lost his seat (which almost never happens) and there was a historic shift towards the left. This is undoubtedly a direct response to the state of politics in the US,thoompa,2025-05-03T08:56:37,74
"A bit of context here from an Australian: The leader of the opposition party (LNP) tied himself heavily to MAGA style anti-woke politics, to the point where he was colloquially known as Temu Trump. It was working in November 2024 when LNP was poling well and favoured to win this election but as Trump got more and more reckless it started to work against them. Thankfully it seems Australia has spoken very loudly and forcefully in our rebuke of American style politics.",ColdAdmirableSponge,2025-05-03T09:06:23,54

"Who could have imagined people would be upset by conservatives dismantling global trade networks, supply chains, security agreements, and just about every other system that underpins Western economic prosperity, in the name of *checks notes* making stricter rules for those transgender people. Totally worth it.
