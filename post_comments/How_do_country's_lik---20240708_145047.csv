"Australian here. Voting is compulsory. The actual fine is trivial, but it has created a cultural expectation that everyone votes. Elections are held on weekends and there are ample opportunities for early voting, so it's incredibly unlikely you'll ever find yourself unable to get to a polling station. The traditional ""democracy sausage"" charity barbecues at polling stations aren't a major factor, but they certainly don't hurt either.  Mandatory voting is, imo, one of the most powerful stabilizing forces in modern democracy. A big part of election campaigning in the United States is about motivating your base. Pander to the extremes to get people to turn up. In Australia, the base are *already* going to turn up because they have to. This makes the extremes irrelevant to deciding the election - you can only win by courting swing voters in the centre. As a consequence, despite our many cultural similarities, Australia is dramatically less polarised than the United States.  We also use preferential voting. Minor parties can run and acheive some success, without damaging the major party on their ""side"". So tactics to split the vote become irrelevant. You really have to win in the centre.  Compulsory voting makes voter suppression a non-issue. We also have an independent commission draw our electorate boundaries, eliminating gerrymandering. This eliminates any real opportunities for cheating, improving public confidence in the system and reducing polarisation.",Juandice,2024-07-08T18:41:34,85

"> I'm interested to hear because my personal theory is that heavy voter turnout in the USA every election, no matter how big or small the election, will stabilize political systems and ideologies.  In a close election like 2016, where the vote is almost 50/50, the electoral college makes it so that only a few votes in a few locations really matter.  If you live in California, or Utah for example, chances are that whatever you do will have no impact in the end result.  This is a structural issue with the American Electoral system.",solid_reign,2024-07-08T19:37:57,16
"In Argentina *presenting* yourself to vote is compulsory (this is not the same as ""voting is compulsory""). The fines are symbolic ($1-2 USD) so folks vote primarily because that makes them feel empowered and that they are making a difference. As well, Argentina is a very politicized country, so most people want to have their say in the political process. Lastly, the older generation (55 and up) still remembers the dictatorship days and they cherish having the right to vote, which try to exercise at every opportunity. In a few words, the high turnaround is more of a cultural thing than a legal one.",Jepense-doncjenuis,2024-07-09T05:45:19,11

"If the U.S. had mandatory voting it likely wouldn't shake things up as much as you’d think.  For those less aware, the U.S. uses the Electoral College system, where each state gets a number of electors roughly based on its population. There are 538 electors in total, and a candidate needs at least 270 of those votes to win the presidency. Most states have a winner-takes-all rule, where the candidate with the most votes in that state takes all its electoral votes. This system can lead to awkward outcomes, like when a candidate wins the presidency while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than their opponent—and yep, it’s happened before, notably in 2000 and 2016.   So, would making voting mandatory change anything? Well, not necessarily. Even if more people vote, the basic structure of the Electoral College stays the same. States that lean heavily toward one party would likely keep doing so. Plus, the system gives small swing states a lot of power, as candidates zero in on these states because they can swing the election.  While mandatory voting *could* get more people involved and possibly tone down extreme campaign tactics, it won’t magically balance out the Electoral College’s scales. For real change in election outcomes, we'd need to tweak how electoral votes are doled out or overhaul this system altogether.",redgluesticks,2024-07-08T21:13:03,4

"Well, I can only speak for Uruguay and Argentina, but voting is mandatory in those two countries. I assume it's similar with a few others on this list as well.   To answer your actual question though, which I assume would be ""why do people in certain countries *voluntarily* vote in such high numbers?"", I'd say that in places where there is a higher degree of public trust and civic pride, people are more inclined to vote. So for example, if you felt like your government generally worked in your interest, did things that you agreed with, and your quality of life was high, you'd be more inclined to vote. That's my take.",fancy-kitten,2024-07-10T13:16:47,2
"Recommend spending time on r/comcast. People there haven’t a choice about which ISP to buy. Voting with only two choice is only slightly better. And among other things, lack of choice creates apathy.   Lack of choice in elections, results in larger part, from winner take all (FPTP) voting setups. Alternatives like rank choice should reduce apathy, improving participation rates. But such reforms also weaken current political parties, so are difficult to pass.",ElectronGuru,2024-07-08T16:08:46,2
"In Australia at least, voting is required by law and you can get in trouble by not doing it.  I see no benefit in encouraging people who are uninterested and uninvolved in politics to give their input into governance through voting. Pushing civically illiterate and ignorant people to provide their voice in the system just leads to worse outcomes because their views aren't grounded in any realistic way. These are the people who know the least about the system while being most prone to misinformation, which is good for power seeking politicians willing to prey on the uninformed, but bad for a stable good system of government.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-07-08T15:20:03,1

"If elections with low turnout that have millions turning out in each state don’t represent the will people, then we should never have a discussion about polls ever ever again.   Most worthy polls have between 900 to 2000 people polled to get to a 3% margin of error.   What is the margin of error if a million people vote where there is a 50% turnout?

"I am obligated to point out that preferential voting systems still have vote splitting, it's just not as bad as ""choose one"" systems.

This $#!† get messy in a hurry, but as a general rule, if you want more parties and more accurate representation you need proportional representation where possible and a voting system that satisfies [Independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives) for the single-winner elections.

I'm a moderate Democrat, but the Democrat talking point of abolishing filibusters and electoral college is phenomenally short sighted imo. It doesn't see past one step. You remove the electoral college, one day it won't benefit the Democrats, and they'll be running to reimplement it. It also helps to prevent extremities. The Democrats are not immune to wild off base policy making that can be destructive to the country, like Republicans. Similarly, that's the case for what needs to be worried about in removing filibusters.  And on top of that, it frustrates me that the party narrative on removing filibusters does not include, ""Oh, you know. It might be a bad thing that if we remove the filibuster, then the Republicans can steam train their agenda that we don't like when they are the ones with the simple majority.""",coolperson7089,2024-07-08T22:27:03,0

If current trends continue and they don't screw themselves over, democrats will have an advantage in the electoral college or popular vote for the presidency.  The EC advantage will be harder for republicans to overcome since the larger states will mostly be blue and they alone will have 270 votes.  The filibuster won't matter because the same forces that makes dems favoured in the EC in the future will doom them in the senate.  They're struggling now for a bare majority.
