"Having read the whole thing, I don't understand why Democrats don't jump on this and support it. If states really want to increase hospital payments, they should do it with their own money.  One of the first GOP proposals I've seen this year that makes sense. This is a good opportunity to get it done.",UnlikelyApe,2025-05-06T10:58:13,-1
"I am all for it. However, in this case, I agree with them.  This is a stupid loophole that just allows states to artificially inflate the cost of Medicaid reimbursed services.",Unable-Entrance3110,2025-05-06T10:35:49,-1
