"Trump [already mentioned it,](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/05/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kamala-harris/75064403007/) but I'd be surprised if it ends up becoming a big story. I certainly don't think we should amplify it, because Russia's goal is to create discord within the US population, so no matter which candidate you support, it's not beneficial to the US to help them pursue their agenda.",nosecohn,2024-09-05T16:01:40,9

"Putin endorsing Trump: not trolling Putin endorsing Harris: trolling  Sounds about right, when something doesn’t benefits democrats it’s always trolling/satire.  I still don’t understand why Putin would even want Trump to win, Trump told him he’d bomb Moscow if he invaded Ukraine and well that’s probably why he did it under Biden, Biden wouldn’t have the balls to tell that to Putin and now we got a war in Europe",Intelligent-Coconut8,2024-09-05T16:24:55,-11

"Agreed on it creating discord. The statements may be personally motivated in some cases, but this seems more an attempt to throw wood on the fire than anything else.

">I still don’t understand why Putin would even want Trump to win, Trump told him he’d bomb Moscow if he invaded Ukraine  Because Trump helps achieve Russians geopolitical goals of having the US withdraw from international agreements and cooperation and leaves spheres of influence open for Russia and their allies to fill. Trump routinely complained we were too hard on Russia and attacked our alliances and treaties.  Additionally, did Trump tell Putin he would bomb them? Or did he tell advisors privately this year? Either way, it's likely more bravado from Trump and Putin realizes this. Trump also has a 24 hour plan to end the conflict in Ukraine, that's also probably nonsense.",ProLifePanda,2024-09-07T09:48:07,1

"It’s pretty sad tbh.  I might not like Obama or Biden, but they’ve each done good things for the country, sure I might despise most of it but I’m willing to admit what I think was good.  Just the bias the left has is disgusting and you know it’s bias because they can never admit Trump did one thing right/good, never.",Intelligent-Coconut8,2024-09-06T09:25:24,1
The burden is on you to support the claim you made that DJT told Putin he would bomb Moscow. It sounds tough but it's a complete departure from the subservient posture Trump has taken toward Putin.,NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T20:21:15,3
> they can never admit Trump did one thing right.   Yep. And the comments I responded to that did were removed by mods.   Reddit is a garbage propaganda machine.,Summerie,2024-09-08T04:29:48,1
"No one knows what Trump said to Putin in a private call. Trump said that in that call he threatened to bomb Moscow if he invaded Ukraine. He said that Putin believed that it was at least 5% or 10% possible that he would actually do it, and that was enough to keep him from acting.   A recording of the call doesn't exist of course, so no one's ever going to be able to prove or disprove that he said it.",Summerie,2024-09-06T01:57:35,1
