"I am old enough to have witnessed firsthand a major shift in the health of Americans.  As a child in the 70's, obese children were rare.  Obese adults were also less common.   Diabetes was called Juvenile (Type I) and Adult Onset (Type II).   Type II, which is typically caused by diet, was unheard of in children.   When kids started getting fat, and getting ""Adult Onset Diabetes"", they had to stop calling it that.  The culprits, in my opinion:    1 - the reliance on process foods, which are convenient, highly palatable, yet deliver very little nutrition.  2 - the rapid increase in sugar consumption, largely driven by the FDA guidelines of ""low fat, no fat"" for health in the late 70's, early 80's.  Manufacturers took out fat, and replaced it with sugar (usually HFCS) to help maintain flavor and shelf life.  That's how we ended up with sugary breads and fat free yogurts with 18 grams of sugar.  We have to reverse this.  It's costing us trillions in healthcare costs, and it's literally killing people.  (Insert here my rant about giving children in public school chocolate milk every day.  [A half pint has roughly 20 grams of sugar.](https://www.instacart.com/products/340069-tru-moo-milk-lowfat-chocolate-1-milkfat-0-5-pt))",LatinNameHere,2025-05-05T08:01:04,159
"I feel like there's a larger dysfunction with our food. High fructose corn syrup is in everything these days, as a cheap/tasty preservative. But we have a shit ton of over processing on even basic things like bread, which has nearly 30 ingredients on the label these days(Wonder white bread as an example).  Meanwhile my own home made white bread has 6 ingredients: flour, yeast, salt, sugar, water, butter.  I don't know how we fix this without a major overhaul in how we approach food in the country. It seems like the above has been a result of a long industrial process of farm -> processor -> supermarket -> table and that's always going to engineer towards low cost and longer shelf lives.",synn89,2025-05-05T10:07:42,21
"This is exactly what they should be going after. The basic health problem in the country is that people consume too many calories, which is largely due to sugar. The other things like banning food dyes are great, but eliminating sugar from peopleâ€™s diets will have by far the greatest impact on overall health.",Moist-Percentage7240,2025-05-05T09:25:38,45
"One of the ""gotchas"" is for people who read the ingredient labels to find products that have low amounts of sugar. ...but don't know that ""maltodextrin"" has three times the glycemic index of sugar.",RedBaronsBrother,2025-05-05T14:00:28,7

No more nanny state shit. You can have warnings but taxes or bans are shit.,kaytin911,2025-05-05T08:03:02,4
"REAL Sugar is not a problem. The problem is HFCS. Also the LACK of moderation. People refuse on average to control themselves. Instead of having one can of soda at lunch, they drink three, or ALL day.   Same with other sources. I know I had a 4ltr a day Mountain Dew habit 20 years ago despite being diabetic. I quit cold turkey. I also quit Fast Food, which has tons of chemicals and tons of HFCS in it.   It is all about MODERATION in your diet. And WE americans wont do it on average.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:25:07,-6
We will look back at how we currently view sugar in the same way about how they used to view smoking tobacco. It does feel like people are generally coming around to how much worse processed sugar is compared to fat though.,mojo276,2025-05-05T08:26:41,60
"Don't forget the LACK of exercise, those of us growing up in the 70's and further in the past ran around outside all the time, didn't sit in front of a computer or tv chowing down on sugary foods all the time. Parents would kick us out of the house if we were in front of the TV.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:27:45,44
"3) fat acceptance, being incredibly sensitive to anything adjacent to fat shaming, and generally just accepting that we can't get in shape.   I fully understand processed foods and culture make it so much harder than it used to be. But if you don't start with the default assumptions that your weight is under your control and you CAN do it, you never will be able to.   Source: I was an ex fatty who was actually motivated by the old fph board when they held a mirror up to my incredibly toxic defeatist thinking.",_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-05T10:03:57,12

"As a type one diabetic who has had to count every carb for the last 21 years, I completely agree. I've actually dreamed of the day where the government would regulate and restrict sugar in most foods.   Again, I'm generally against regulations that should be personal choice, but sugar and processed food are drugs. Go on a junk food bender then abruptly start eating healthy again and you'll be wondering where you can get your next candy bar or how to get another bag of chips.",no_sleep_johnny,2025-05-05T09:39:50,15
I like bananas. It broke my heart when I found out they have a very high glycemic index ðŸ˜¦,sowellpatrol,2025-05-06T01:15:01,2
"> REAL Sugar is not a problem. The problem is HFCS.  This just has no basis in science.   Sugar is glucose/fructose, HFSC is glucose/fructose.    While HFCS is higher in fructose - the sugar in fruit - the real problem is the quantity that we eat.  And your gut does not differentiate between sugar inherent in foods, and added sugar.  All gets digested the same.  https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/high-fructose-corn-syrup-or-table-sugar-for-better-health-avoid-too-much-of-either/  https://www.popsci.com/high-fructose-corn-syrup-sugar/",LatinNameHere,2025-05-05T09:23:19,30
"Also good to remember that our government pays farmers to grow corn which is turned into HFCS making it much much cheaper than it should be. So with one hand our government subsidizes HFCS making it super cheap, then with the other hand tells us to eat less sugar.",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-05-05T09:02:48,22
"Bullshit.  Table sugar is functionally the same as fructose.  It doesn't matter if your sweet comes from corn or cane or comb, it's all the same.  Too much is gonna cause diabetes and other health problems.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-05T09:10:36,18
"I have to disagree a bit. Calories are calories, doesnâ€™t matter if theyâ€™re from sugar or HFCS. If we just replace HFCS with sugar in all products, we will not see much variance in health outcomes.  I also disagree about the moderation point. We donâ€™t really need moderation of poisons, we actually need elimination. Thereâ€™s a pretty good argument to be made that any quantity of Mountain Dew, per your example, is inherently bad for you.",Moist-Percentage7240,2025-05-05T10:17:22,4
"Iâ€™m not convinced this is a factor. While Iâ€™m sure it is to some extent, it pales in comparison to the food issue people exercise like crazy today and still have issues maintaining weight. Nobody exercised in the 70s people could be rail skinny sitting on the couch, drinking beer all day. Itâ€™s all about the food.Â ",North_Moment5811,2025-05-06T11:24:11,2
"What your kids eats matters too.  I know too many parents who think they are making good choices, and they are loading kids up with juice.  (just one example)  It's also considerably harder to overeat when eating real food vs highly processed foods.  Meat and a vegetable will make you full,  chips and fruits snacks do not.",LatinNameHere,2025-05-05T09:12:33,40

Overfeeding your kid high sugar foods is the primary cause. There are TONS of foods kids can have as much as they want and be fine.,mojo276,2025-05-05T08:25:22,2
"I feel exactly the same regarding regulations. In my opinion the health in this country has gotten so bad we need regulations. These foods are poisons for our bodies, and we donâ€™t allow for people to consume poison just for the sake of people having freedom. If you get really into how big grocery develops these poison foods itâ€™s actually disgusting to see how they make everything that is terrible for you so addictive. The R&D involved with junk food is predatory. Our current system allows big grocery to feed big pharma patients on a silver platter.",Moist-Percentage7240,2025-05-05T10:11:22,9
