"I think most importantly, not an overall decrease to Chinese exports. Which should scare the pants off any serious people involved in this ""trade war."" Not sure that I trust any numbers coming out of China but that is what is reported.",duke_chute,2025-05-09T08:19:45,12

"Yep, 20% left things at the dock.  The other 80% is showing up costing double. Some vendors that I purchase from are hoping I'll pay the higher rate.  For contracts that I'm stuck needing the material, I'll pay it.  But going forward, not going to happen.    So while the May headline is 20% drop in June it will be 35% and in July it will be 60%.   I'll pick up cheaper in the US until those suppliers figure out that they can be a dollar under the China price.    Tariffs are a lot like the frog in the pot, the costs (heat) will slowly rise around us.  It will take a few months to find out we are cooked.",kiltedturtle,2025-05-09T09:41:08,2

"This estimate is conservative compared to what ports are reporting right now. Due to shipping transit times, the West Coast experiences it first.  They may also be averaging it with the first four months of this year, but those months were higher than average because retailers were front loading (shipping all the inventory they could early to try to avoid the tariffs). As a result that also means that impacts may be delayed a few months until US warehouse inventories are depleted again.  This is also what a lot of the conservative media is reporting. Contrasting the overly fear-mongering posts of ""empty"" ports with numbers of the record months. The news outlets won't be able to obfuscate the numbers for long if the tariffs remain in place.  LA County (31% of 2024 volume) - down 35% compared to this time last year   https://www.npr.org/2025/05/07/nx-s1-5389955/los-angeles-port-tariffs  Shipping companies are corroborating. Comparing drop in volume to what we saw in Covid when manufacturing shutdowns occurred.  https://www.businessinsider.com/maersk-us-china-container-cargo-plunge-trump-tariffs-empty-shelves-2025-5  https://www.investors.com/news/trump-trade-war-stock-market-empty-shelves-recession-predicted/  SeaTac expecting 40% less Chinese imports   https://www.king5.com/article/money/business/greatest-impacts-trump-tariff-war-coming-soon-ports-seattle-tacoma/281-c51206b3-e386-4636-89bb-fb86ca6b200d  Mobile, Alabama Chinese imports down 40% over last year   https://mynbc15.com/news/local/chinese-imports-at-mobiles-port-down-40-year-over-year  De minimis is over. So there will be much fewer smaller packages coming over from China. UPS/FedEx will suffer.  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/business/trump-tariffs-ups-fedex.html  And separate from tariffs, and not talked enough about, is that Trump has levied port fees on Chinese built and owned ships (to encourage American shipbuilding again I guess?). It could mean an extra $1 million of fees charged to EACH cargo ship per voyage.  https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vehicle-carriers-seek-relief-broad-us-port-fees-2025-04-25/  China's foreign trade went up 5% in April - they're not hurting and just shifting to other countries.   https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202505/1333661.shtml?id=12",jjmoreta,2025-05-09T16:44:29,1
"Such a bad plan.   Honestly I would be fine if Trump did some economic moves that worked and actually benefitted the country. I would agree the economy and its relation to everyday Americans has needed improvement for decades now, so some new ideas I'm all for it  However the lack of trust in both the integrity of Trump and the the impression I get that he not only doesn't really know what he's doing, but is surrounding himself with people who also do not understand these things at a level required to make intelligent decisions just makes this a disaster. Turning a slightly bad situation into a nightmare situation.   It's like the Dolphins firing Mike McDaniel because of underperformance and hiring their top Reddit commenter as HC and then filling their front office with his fantasy football buddies. So completely out of their depth in that position, and understanding things at such an elementary level, that the entire NFL will easily exploit every weakness and blind spot they have. Not only will they go 0-17 but the damage done will set that franchise back a decade if not more.  That's where we're at now, and it's all justified by the people who support this madness because ""What the previous guy didnt get us a Super Bowl, so different is by default better"" when nothing works that way.",TaxGuy2930,2025-05-09T08:26:30,1

"I am sure that we can’t trust any numbers coming out of China. They make the MAGA propagandists look like amateurs.  But it’s likely there is not a 1 to 1 drop in their exports against our drop in imports. I’m in the camp of we need them more than they need us. But yah, you can bet any numbers from them are not going to be accurate.",umassmza,2025-05-09T08:36:19,5
