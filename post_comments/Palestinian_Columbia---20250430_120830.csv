They are still in the process of deporting him.  This just means he can remain free while fighting the deportation.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-30T12:31:31,139
Revoke his permanent residence visa.  All visas can be revoked for criminal activities administratively.,letmeinfornow,2025-04-30T12:25:06,146
I'm not even sure an October 7th-like event here in the US would open judges' eyes. They sure don't remember 9/11.,triggernaut,2025-04-30T12:12:46,86
F'ing jerk but IF he's here legally then he allowed to be one. Hopefully they are looking very closely at his status....just to make sure.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-30T12:37:21,30

Hope he likes Vermont.    I would wager if he leaves the state he'll be picked up by ICE and find himself in Texas or Louisiana within hours.,The_End_Is_Tomorrow,2025-04-30T12:19:06,8

Theyâ€™re blind and want to see the U.S. burned to the ground.,cofcof420,2025-04-30T14:42:13,34
"I agree.  Seems like the celebrations from the left are premature.  Maybe they can drag it out a while, but in the end he is likely gone.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-30T20:31:16,9
