"Let me get this straight.  China - a country which is famous for having a very big ""do not lose face""-type culture.  A country which has explicitly described Trump's actions as ""disrespectful"".    A country which likely half-expected this six months ago and has blocked export of rare earth minerals to the US.  A country which has sent over a hundred Boeing jets back.  This Fox thinks is caving?",jimicus,2025-04-25T16:50:00,6

"Oh please. I‚Äôm not one to tout but my MPA is hyper focused on foreign policy and I spend a lot of time thinking about the PRC. Like a lot. If anyone has ever played Go or read Sun Tzu, China‚Äôs trade war tactics make sense. Sun Tzu teaches you to piss off your enemy without movement and aggressive posturing. The game Go is about encircling your opponent until they suffocate. That‚Äôs what the PRC did here. They let Trump make all the moves, all the mistakes, and they slowly surrounded him. Trump is used to making loud noises and an opponent backing off. The PRC has 3,000 years of history on how to use that tactic against their opponent. Trump went into a room expecting to play checkers and scream king me, China was playing Go.  I‚Äôm not sitting here saying China is awesome, I‚Äôm sitting here saying ‚Äúdo not underestimate their resolve.‚Äù Their desire for Pacific hegemony and super power status predates the PRC by half a century. They are more than willing to watch a nation trip over itself to achieve their goals.",Kcb1986,2025-04-25T16:57:15,3
China‚Äôs not caving lmao. Their domestic market alone is like five times the size of ours. We‚Äôre the ones addicted to having our cheap plastic crap made there. We have everything to lose in this scenario and they know it.,get-the-marshmallows,2025-04-25T17:23:00,5

"China is reducing their tariffs on products that hurt Chinese businesses, while keeping tariffs on products that don't. This seems like a common sense thing to do.

Damn right.  I had to post this as an example.  When I talk to people that watch fox 24 I used to be confused as to why their info always seemed to be off.  Its because they watch curated bullshit on fox news.  Other bullshit right wing media outlets have sprung up.     I used to try and debate these people but I now know its useless.  They cannot be saved.,jpcapone,2025-04-25T16:56:18,3
"The comments get bizarre late at night when they‚Äôre not as well moderated. During daytime hours it‚Äôs pretty well controlled at being usually around 80% support and 20% against, but after 10pm west coast time they kinda turn into an unmoderated mess. Some, I believe, are being paid and are foreign, as the language used sounds similar to those not speaking English natively (for example Eastern European languages don‚Äôt use ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúan) and often they‚Äôre making mistakes that would be extremely odd in English. I also was scrolling through late at night when some people were posting there acting all in support of something happening and then they started to argue in Hebrew at each other about how much each other is getting paid, like who was getting more or something. Odd because they were both making posts in support of one of the EOs",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-04-25T16:45:42,6
