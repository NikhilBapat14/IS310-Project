"I'm an Australian but come on, the Liberal party has been terrible for decades and Albo is marginally to the left of them.  It'll absolutely be business as usual, and we were screwed no matter which party won.  EDIT: Just to expand on this, this is not the same as Canada. Canadians voted in the same government who'd been screwing them for a decade plus. Ridiculous and pathetic from them.  Here in Australia, we re-elected a government who have only been in power for 3 years. The previous party, had basically been in power for a decade (and also between before 2000 - 2009) and ramped up all things we hate like the housing crisis, mass migration and also destroying any chance of fast internet.  I'm not a fan of Labor (the party who won), but they have not made things drastically worse, they've been about the same as the ""right wing"" party. That's the problem in Australia, both major parties support corporate interests and our entire economy revolves around keeping house prices high.",Entilen,2025-05-03T06:17:35,705
"Was it like the Canadians where they feared Trump so hard they ran the other way?   I'm not too familiar with Aus politics.   Beyond watching ""Lefties Losing it, Rita Panehi""  And that day where the Aus council argued that there was a massive gender pay gap and they were brutalized by the guy asking ""Are you accounting for hours worked? And positions held?""  And they ask meekly said No!",Aronacus,2025-05-03T07:05:37,114

"They really should change the name of their party from Liberal to Conservative (or Republican to match us)  Why call themselves Liberals when they are supposed to be leading the fight against the libs? Confused people are probably voting for the wrong party.  By the way, I work for a multinational corporation and I always notice my Australian colleagues are easily confused.",JessicaRoundbottom,2025-05-03T07:09:34,-320
">Was it like the Canadians where they feared Trump so hard they ran the other way?   Yes. This was part of the ""scare campaign"" run by the party who won.   The Labor Party won on a scare campaign. This party has the media in their pocket like the Dems do in the USA.   Also the problem with the ""conservative"" party is that they are centre left as well and not really giving anyone an alternative to vote for.",lets_shake_hands,2025-05-03T17:35:56,15

"We don't have the same gun culture as the US and never did. We had one bad shooting and never did again. It should say something that one of the worst days in Aus history is to the USA, a Tuesday.  But it isn't like the US have ever actually risen up against your government since the Civil War.  I have nothing to base this thought on other than guy feelings but it's possible that mandatory voting is just as effective at keeping a government in check as an armed populace.  To be clear, I have nothing against the US in their honour of the 2nd amendment. Gun ownership in the US is something that makes sense to me when it's so engrained in your culture and I think that's actually something to be proud of, so long as it's properly respected of course.  I'm just saying Aus doesn't have a similar culture and as a result, I wouldn't say any movements on the part of the government are a result of our populations access to arms.",TheSearchForMars,2025-05-03T10:28:23,77
"""Liberal"" doesn't necessarily mean Left or Progressive. It's become synonymous with those terms in the U.S., but I personally think it's a gross oversimplification. And our erroneous understanding and definitions certainly don't apply the world over.  Separately it would be weird for a country that's technically a monarchy to call the conservative party ""republican.""",NiceSeaworthiness909,2025-05-03T09:42:18,159
No one is confused about who they're voting for. Our parties don't get anywhere near as extreme because voting is mandatory so you can't just whip up a strong base of radicals and expect to make headway.,TheSearchForMars,2025-05-03T10:20:29,75

"I mean, sure, the people always get what they deserve, but Trump did reverse the polls. It is funny to imagine Canadians endorsing the current trajectory because they unironically thought Trump was going to send the US military into Ottawa or something.  Truthfully, until Canadians are fed up with their healthcare/welfare system the whole country is doomed to stagnate. Their GDP/capita from 2011 is 97% the size of what it currently is. Americans have been going ballistic about 20% real median income growth over the last 15 years not being enough, but Canada's almost assuredly has been negative. Of course immigration isn't helping, but their immigration rate had been consistent from 2000 up until around the pandemic (where it doubled) and the stagnation predated it by a decade.",cplusequals,2025-05-03T11:18:28,14

"The Canadian Tories were only headed toward an easy win because of the Liberal's implosion, not because of any strength or enthusiasm of their own. Trump's misguided antics took away an unearned win from them, but that's the thing: they had done nothing to actually earn the win.  Similar story in Australia, where you also had a feckless conservative/center-right party - but in Australia, the leftist party wasn't nearly as much of a dumpster fire as their Canadian peers, so they ended up with a dominant win.",Black_XistenZ,2025-05-03T12:16:01,13
"The president of one country doesn‚Äôt impact the election for a president in a completely different country unless there‚Äôs some really extenuating circumstances, and this doesn‚Äôt fit the bill.   That‚Äôs like saying the US elected Trump because of what Trudeau was doing in Canada.

"Trump did not ""reverse the polls"" stop parroting this leftist lie.  The polls changed when Trudeau dropped out and the first thing Carney did was say he was going to eliminate the carbon tax. Little PP had based his entire campaign on ""I'm not Trudeau and I'll eliminate the carbon tax"" so of course he fell apart when those two things got taken off the table.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-03T12:39:13,-6

‚ÄúA completely different country‚Äù They are literally our neighbors and our biggest trading allies. We aren‚Äôt all that different and their biggest cities border our north east states.

"Polls had conservatives ahead even after Trudeau resigned. The polls didn't reverse until early February coinciding with Trump's tariffs specifically targeting Canada.  If you want the right to win, start be being more correct and less partisan in your analysis. If the right can accurately identify missteps, it can avoid future ones. If you pretend blatant own-goals were actually wins, like the left does, you're going to drive the car off of the cliff and the right will only win when it does this less than the left does.",cplusequals,2025-05-03T13:52:56,24
"Yes, they border us and yes, they are a completely different country and have a completely different way of life than we do. Just because they speak the same language doesn‚Äôt make us the same. Plenty of European countries border one another and are vastly different.   Trump did not play a role in the Canadian election of their new PM. It‚Äôs just a media/liberal talking point to try and play up Trump ‚Äúlosing momentum‚Äù heading into the midterms.   Once again, average citizens don‚Äôt give a fuck about another country‚Äôs president when electing their own. Don‚Äôt remember the last time I considered who Mexico‚Äôs president is when in the ballot box. They border us too with cities right on the border.",Shooter_McGavin27,2025-05-03T17:35:04,0
"> Having an ally say they want to take you  Except that's not what happened. He offered and said they should do it because it would be mutually beneficial.
