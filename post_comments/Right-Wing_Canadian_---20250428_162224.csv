"DOJ might not be able to prosecute Trump due to that Nixon-era policy memo, but I'd have a good laugh if Canada did for election interference.  I'm probably biased by my observations in an area that caters to snowbirds, but I sincerely believe that Trump doen't understand or accept 1% of the amount that Canadians are fed up with him.  Rather than use the derivative ""I did that!"" stickers here and there, it would be clearer, though possibly more expensive due to how ubiquitous they are, to use the Canadian ""T"" to label ALL of the shelves of goods affected by Trump's tariffs.",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-04-28T16:26:29,107

"Trump single-handedly engineered the largest and most rapid collapse of a political party’s fortunes in Canadian history.   The Cons had a consistent 20–25 point lead in every poll for at least a year. The Liberal party was in danger of losing official party status (fewer than 12 seats). It all melted away in less than 2 months.

What strikes me most is the fact that these Canadian commentators seem to completely oversee the way that Canada has slowly but surely been degraded and succumbed farther and farther over the past couple of decades. I think there is an irreparable, massive cultural shift which has taken place mainly through the dogmatic lens purported by the education system which forces everyone to live with a mask which remains even when they look in the mirror and forces each and every individual to see themselves as morally incorruptible.

"Pollievre hasn’t taken a hard enough stance on Trump at all — if he wanted any chance of winning he would have put his foot down and pushed himself as far away as possible from the orange clown. Told him to keep his name out of his mouth and out of his tweets. Then you have Danielle Smith endorsing Trump too — of course everyone is going to associate the conservatives with Trump. Pollievre failed to pivot when Trudeau stepped down as well. Their whole campaign was based on Pollievre not being Trudeau. When Carney stepped up, Pollievre had nothing to offer anymore. Any way you look at it, Carney is better choice for a leader especially during uncertain economic times. Pollievre screwed up by cozying up to Maple MAGAs and not being precise enough with what he wants to do to make Canadian lives better. He’d probably make a “meh” peacetime prime minister, but that’s not what we need right now.

Although another News channel owned by News Corp is Sky News which is the Australian equivalent of Fox News here.  Just get on youtube and watch some of it - it's almost an exact replica of Fox News (not to be mistaken with Sky New UK though).  The unfortunate thing about that is that it is free to air in some regions of Australia, so their bullshit gets more exposure and primarily to the regions that would be more right leaning.  Looking up the history of News Corp in Australia, it says that News Corp media has endorsed the right wing party (Coalition) for the past 5 elections.

Even the idea that he could be considered a viable candidate left the rest of the world wondering if the US had gone insane. It didn’t even matter that he eventually won... just the fact that one of your parties thought he was the best candidate they could find to compete is just so ridiculous that it calls into question everything about the country. It’s education standards. It’s citizens knowledge of basic global politics and standards. The ability of its citizens to understand concepts like respect, honour and integrity. Whether its citizens even have an ounce of respect for each other, and themselves.  It’s not that a lot of its people are religious. Or incredibly proud of their military. Or that they get outraged over ethical scandals that others in other countries might consider fairly minor (like Clinton’s oval office blowjob). These are all things that can be found in other places, and every place has some things that others don’t, or aren’t looked at the same way.  It’s that those same people irreverently adore a man who proudly flaunts behaviour and beliefs that any normal person of their religion would be condemned for. A man that has utter disdain for the military men and women they are proud of. It’s hard to even understand what Trump and his followers even stand for. They are christians who hate helping the poor. That commit adultery. That hate their neighbours. They’re capitalists who seem to now despise the free market they said they loved. They’re poor people sick of the rich keeping them down, that then hand the keys to the country to a few billionaires.  It’s all irrational, self-defeating nonsense, that seemingly changes on a dime for even less logical reasons. Today it’s that Russia is a friend, and America’s allies are all parasitical enemies. Tomorrow its that free and open trade, that was the hallmark of their dominant global economic policy, is bad. None of these changes even benefits the country, or the groups championing these things.  A country like Iran, we’ll disagree with rather severely on many issues. Such as religion and government being intertwined. But at least you know that tomorrow, you’ll wake up and Iran will still be a place where its religion and government is intertwined. It won’t suddenly be an atheistic place where its religious leaders decide trade policy with a cheese wheel, and its economists preach in Klingon about how evil water is.  No, the world doesn’t respect or fear the US more under Trump than it did under Biden. Or Obama. Or Bush, or Clinton. The world just doesn’t look at the US as a rational actor any more.
