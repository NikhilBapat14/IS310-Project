"No, they won’t. And I say that as a person that owns a manufacturing company that employs about 70 people. Absolutely everything is intertwined globally in terms of supply chain, and when people talk about how “this will just make people move production here” they have *absolutely* no concept of how much money, rime and then a shit ton more money this will cost.",Organic-Class-8537,2025-04-23T00:04:04,34

"Trump is deeply stuck in the 1980’s socially, politically, economically and culturally. He’s fighting battles for US manufacturing that only made sense before NAFTA was settled. Those jobs left and aren’t coming back. We’ve adjusted to that during those thirty plus years. And the value in that sector wasn’t the tasks or industries but rather their typically higher pay. Often unionized, they were part of the path to the American dream. Like the manufacturing that remains, any reshoring will be mostly automated and the few jobs that are created won’t be inflation adjusted versions of what we lost. Despite this reality, Trump is pursuing it because it plays well with his base, it shows well in video and it’s what he and his similarly aged advisors know.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-23T00:42:02,5
"No shit, and they stopped actual manufacturing jobs that were created by Biden's infrastructure bill and the CHIPS Act, will cost us more money to establish and maintain supply chains for domestic products, and have pushed out anyone interest in moving some manufacturing here.",atreeismissing,2025-04-23T00:26:52,6

"One of the main reasons manufacturing is done abroad is because despite being one of the most exploitative forms of capitalism in the ""developed"" world, with next to no union protections, no federal paid leave, no universal healthcare, stagnant federal minimum wage, legalized stock buybacks, and now with shuttering Civil Rights offices and further gutting regulations, these companies will STILL find more exploitable workers abroad. Loosening child labor laws in the US won't bring manufacturing back either. They already have children they can pay pennies or nothing at all. Nestle literally won a case before the Supreme Court whose ruling allows US companies to use slave labor as long as it's not American slaves (unless they're incarcerated of course).   Manufacturing in the US has lost its glamor. When service jobs, white-collar jobs pay just as well or better than factory work, then there will always be a labor shortage in the factories. We can make stuff in the US, and we should, but as long as capital owners control the factories and bribe politicians to continue maintaining and facilitating this exploitation, their employees here and abroad will only know suffering at their hands. Let the workers organize or collectivize the factories.",papibigdaddy,2025-04-23T02:11:59,2

Yeah it'd be nice if we could make our own iphones that'd cost a whole lot more but we'd get an employee discount. Most of the parts are made abroad so if you want the whole thing made in the states you'll need to build all those factories too.,WordOfLies,2025-04-22T23:49:04,1
