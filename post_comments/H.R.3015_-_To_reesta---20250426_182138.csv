"It's just absurd. the US government is bending over backwards to bring back an industry that died decades ago.

But there's no one to work the coal mines unless they hire foreigners. The current workers children don't want to work the mines. But...oh I get it. He plans to open camps and then make them work the mines until they're deported. Got it. /s,TwistedMemories,2025-04-26T20:35:52,3
"Talk about waste and fraud.  How much more can they kick this dead horse?  Instead of new training and free education to those workers...we'll probably end up subsidizinig big coal, to the tune of billions of dollars, just so Cheeto can claim a win.  Why don't we bring back asbestos? Whale oil lamps? MAYBE we should look into steam engine locomotives while we're at it.  The ENTIRE coal mining industry employs under 50,000 workers, it'd probably be cheaper and easier to just to give them all pensions, let them retire and call it a day...but nope. Nope. Nah..we're gonna bring back cancer and smog.",Pantarus,2025-04-26T21:50:02,3
"""Coal industry leaders of the council, what do you recommend on government matters related to coal and your industry?""  ""First: The government should find ways to buy more coal, maybe a national coal reserve so we don't have to stop digging it out of the ground if there's a lapse in demand.     Second, get rid of all regulations related to coal mining and emissions related to burning coal or generating energy from coal. Also indemnify us from any medical or financial liability related to its mining or use.    Third, take away all incentives to make or use alternative energy sources and mandate that these sources of energy are disconnected from the national grids. Along with this, no more approvals for new nuclear plants, or new solar or wind farms.    Fourth, the government should put lipstick on this pig and spend taxpayer money to glorify the use of coal over other sources of energy.""
