"Trump cuts their money by about 25 % and scraps big projects like the Mars sample return and the SLS moon rocket after billions were already spent. Because of this, NASA may have to lean more on private rockets such as SpaceXâ€™s Starship instead of building its own.",TLakes,2025-05-07T19:25:41,7
"To be canceled:  - The Mars Sample Return Mission - The Space Launch System (SLS) moon rocket and the Orion spacecraft  -  Gateway spacecraft, a small space station planned for lunar orbit - research into environmentally sustainable aviation",box-cable,2025-05-07T19:33:48,3

Let China control space.  America's reputation and leadership are long gone.,Lobster_roll_dinner,2025-05-07T20:48:50,2
It means Leon is taking over.,Ryan1980123,2025-05-07T20:12:05,1
"I will say, to be fair, the SLS was always questionable at best. The fact that it's just recycling shuttle-era parts and isn't super well put together, lest we forget just how many times the first flight of Orion was pushed back, delayed, and launch attempts aborted due to issues.   That said, we need a better option than Space X, too.",Hornpipe_Jones,2025-05-07T21:10:05,0
"People keep saying cut 25% but itâ€™s much, much higher than that because thereâ€™s a huge increase in the program that goes to SpaceX. So NASA isnâ€™t actually getting that money at all for it. Itâ€™s just funneling it to welfare Musk who canâ€™t even launch a rocket into orbit.Â ",femme_mystique,2025-05-07T22:54:38,2
"Fun fact, this is effectively the second time the sls has been cancelled, the first being when Obama shelved the ares/constellation program.",jackblackbackinthesa,2025-05-07T22:30:54,1
"Yeah, Iâ€™m not confident if this is net positive or negative for space flight. Sls was incredibly expensive, it will be interesting to see if spacex can reduce the cost to deep space in the same way they did access to the iss. I agree though that there needs to be more than one contractor that can provide the service.",jackblackbackinthesa,2025-05-07T22:33:22,1
"Honestly, the fact that they didn't have an actual, suitable replacement that wasn't just reusing stuff in place going back to the shuttle era was a bad sign. The problem is as people like Neil Degrasse Tyson has pointed out for over a decade, space flight doesn't capture the public's attention like it did during the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo/Skylab/early Shuttle eras. 40+ years in LEO has made the public 'meh' on it. And Republicans going hardcore anti-science doesn't help.   If we had an admin that had the same passion for space exploration that JFK did, the results would be amazing.",Hornpipe_Jones,2025-05-08T00:17:36,1
"I think youâ€™ll see that shift if China beats America back to the moon, looks like theyâ€™re targeting 2029. I suspect weâ€™re at least 2029 for Artemis 3.",jackblackbackinthesa,2025-05-08T00:26:58,1
"I'm pretty sure they will. For all their faults, China is actually interested in advancing science and tech into the 21st century, rather than desperately yanking us back to the early 1900s with some kind of fantasy that we can make the country back as it used to be in the Rockerfeller ages and all will be fine.",Hornpipe_Jones,2025-05-08T15:06:52,1
