Social Security dwarfs all other MAGA-DOGE issues.   We're talking about a demographic with a high voter turnout rate which has time to get more politically engaged than most other groups.   It's downright foolish not to at least mention Social Security in every criticism of the Trump-Musk régime.,clamorous_owle,2025-03-30T07:04:35,19

"Because they don’t think it matters anymore. They are actively trying to convince people that the only ones that will be upset about missing social security checks are fraudsters, not your grandparents or parents.  Here’s a Trump admin official talking about it:  https://www.newsweek.com/howard-lutnick-social-security-real-america-2048911  In true GOP fashion, there officials out here using the “true Scotsman” fallacy to try and convince people that “real America” won’t care about their social security stopping.",Enabling_Turtle,2025-03-30T15:59:01,3
"because elections are over. This is a full dismantling and takeover of the USA by the Billionaires.  Voting was the best way for change and now that’s gone.
