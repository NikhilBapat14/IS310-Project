"My Autism allows me to see patterns really easily. I am also aware of 20th century history. It's a bad time for people like that right now.   In all honesty what's the thing that is a bridge too far?

I wish they would start calling this stuff what it is. They bend over backwards to use language that legitimizes this shit.,zenmogwai,2025-04-25T22:36:18,3

Americans have been trained by decades of propaganda to be incredibly selfish. It's going to take *way more* than it'd take in pretty much any other society for something to trigger. That doesn't mean people should stop trying.,HarwellDekatron,2025-04-25T17:05:48,13
"I think it is a lot of things.   The biggest issue is most of us don't know how to organize the type of large scale action needed.    There are also I am sure a lot of people realizing no one is coming to save us, and instead of realizing we need to save ourselves will just roll over and make themselves small.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-25T17:26:44,2

Agreed. Americans really are the most proagandized people in the world. It hurts my heart to think of how bad it's going to get for a lot of friends I have in the US.,Rough_Bread8329,2025-04-25T17:11:02,3
That's my default take typically but the media has been pretty good (not great by any means) since the election.  The problem is they needed to be pretty good prior and they totally failed on that one.,atreeismissing,2025-04-25T21:37:49,3
"It is genuinely terrifying.  My husband and I are weighing if we leave, and it is a heart breaking decision.    My dad has Parkinson's and Diabetes (which for anyone who doesn't know the average life expectancy from diagnosis w/ Parkinson's if you also have Diabetes is 7 years).  He was diagnosed 2 years ago.    I know logically he would tell me to leave, even if he couldn't get out.  But I also know that realistically with the path America is on and how long it typically takes a country to get out from under an authoritarian regime I wouldn't see my Dad again.  I'm in my late 30's, I may not ever get to go back to America if I leave.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-25T17:30:13,1
