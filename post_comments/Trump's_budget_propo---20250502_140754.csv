But we all will have employment building muskets and tearing up rags for the field hospitals at least.,Justin_P_,2025-05-02T20:18:08,1
"Trump has been spit roasted by Musk and Putin for a little over a hundred days straight, he was shriveled and flaccid the entire time. He is performing at the level required.",Justin_P_,2025-05-02T20:15:53,1
