The vast majority of my American firefighter brothers are hard-core Maga Trump supporters.   Even the Reddit firefighting sub leans reich wing and its maga mods censor posts critical of the führer.   They are sadly getting what they voted for.  FAFO.,Lord-Velveeta,2025-04-25T07:48:38,112

Not sure if it's because it represents Americans lack of critical thinking. That Republicans love parades they are featured in or what. But looking at how much republicans hate unions yet how many firefighters back Republicans it's weird.

"Thank you for this.   As a retired FF, yes some stations have less calls and sometimes the public sees “standing around” as free money. Paid services have to be out the door within a certain time frame so you can’t get super involved in anything else.   Would the public rather have a 30 second out the door response time or 5 minutes because the crew was elbows deep in a messy project given to them for the sake of “earning” every hour of pay?  But that doesn’t mean they aren’t doing equipment checks, maintenance, continuing education or planning out for mass casualty events, evacuation plans, cleaning turnout gear so they don’t inadvertently catch on fire from residue buildup.   24 hour shifts with back to back to back calls take a toll on the body.   I challenge anyone to put on the gear, carry an axe and 50 feet of hose and hoof it up 30 flights of stairs before even doing the part of putting out the fire and dragging victims out.  Same with folks that work night shift at any job- they generally get all kinds of work piled on because “they just sit around playing cards and bullshitting”  As for politics- that job is very political when it comes to keeping your job and that’s a freaking shame.",Positive_botts,2025-04-25T15:45:12,5
