Making benefits more difficult for those above the poverty line.  The poverty line for a single person in the US is around $7.50/hr.  Let that sink in...,aperson7780,2025-05-07T07:25:36,43
The information in the title doesn‚Äôt address the most significant part of this equation.  Poor people won‚Äôt have the money to pay for coverage that was previously covered by Medicaid. Subsequently they will go untreated and suffer.  Where are the Trump ‚Äì Christians?   Why are they not calling this out?,thomport,2025-05-07T08:09:58,28
They don‚Äôt understand that many people on Medicaid are already working as much as they can in the best job they‚Äôre able to get. All this does is harm poor people more.,momob3rry,2025-05-07T09:37:19,15
"If your going to f**k somebody, then the poor are the least likely to fight back. They‚Äôre already down, you might as well kick them. Give them absolutely no chance to dig themselves out of the hole they are in. Also take a shot at their children and call it a twofor. How smug republicans must feel at their dinner table.",NoReserve7293,2025-05-07T07:28:12,11

"‚ÄúA lot of these policies will add administrative costs for the states, burdens for people, the potential for more improper payments and errors in processing,‚Äù said Allison Orris, director of Medicaid policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). ‚ÄúAll of this shifting of the ball can result in people losing coverage.‚Äù  There's the ball game folks. Break the system and invite more corruption into the picture, but also fuck over lower class folks. That's the Republican playbook in action.",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-07T09:10:18,7

"I argued with someone on the christian subreddit about this once - why they (a self described devout Christian) oppose the government caring for the poor.   Their answer was that ""mandatory"" charity in the form of taxes was of no value, and that individual people should each be making the individual choice to help others.",Low_Chance,2025-05-07T11:46:04,2

The so-called Christians aren‚Äôt what?   We all know christians and their church hierarchy overwhelmingly voted Trump into office. What Trump is doing is no surprise.,thomport,2025-05-07T08:48:43,7
"They're absolutely making it harder for the educated too. And even for many wealthy people, though I definitely agree we must prioritize helping the poor as they're going to be hit hardest and fastest. Cuts to Medicare/Medicaid will absolutely gut the healthcare and pharma industries, and government cuts (along with tarriffs and immigration madness) are currently hammering higher education and tech. Agriculture and retail are also suffering, along with wall street and even banks to a degree. If we don't stop soon and return to a state of relative normalcy, America and the world will absolutely go into an economic recession and possible depression.  The car is currently being driven off the cliff by a select group of psychos and conmen who are completely disinterested in making things better for anyone save themselves. That we have arrived at this point is a pretty scathing indictment of American culture and the average voter, but I think it's really important we all realize that things are getting demonstrably worse for almost everyone right now and point our frustration to a common enemy.",danosaurus1,2025-05-07T11:20:03,4
