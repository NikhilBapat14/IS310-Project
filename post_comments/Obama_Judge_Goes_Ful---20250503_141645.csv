"Ummm… security clearance is the executive branch… trump heads said branch… so what in the actual fuck is the problem? How is one branch gonna over rule the other, when it’s specifically within the scope of said branch? That’s like target telling walmart they are not allowed to fire their own employee.",fearless-penguin,2025-05-03T14:51:22,138
"So let’s get this straight:  The President cannot cancel security clearances. The real question then becomes, who exactly is in charge of security clearances?   Why don’t we just cut to the chase and end the games: Who actually runs the executive branch of the US government?",jcr2022,2025-05-03T17:36:09,62
Is this judicial mis-conduct?     Would it be appropriate for the Judicial Committee take a look into this?,Johnnie-Dazzle,2025-05-03T16:28:26,60
Didnt they take trumps away? Whats (D)ifferent now?,Jurclassic5,2025-05-03T18:18:19,14

I guess the Judges do according to them.,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-05-03T18:50:59,34
That would require Congress to actually do their job and give a crap. Neither of which they seem to know how to do anymore…,CamoAnimal,2025-05-03T18:44:04,27
"I was thinking the same! Either the judge is too inept and doesn’t understand enough to do the job, or its purposeful misconduct. It’s gotta be one or the other and both are really bad — judges who aren’t honorable or who don’t understand basic government structure should not keep holding these positions.",Szorja,2025-05-03T22:53:48,4
Sometimes it’s just (D)ifferent… depending on the letter after their name… R or D.,fearless-penguin,2025-05-03T15:04:50,54
