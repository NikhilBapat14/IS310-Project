"Not really, when you do a Nazi salute, have it pointed out to you that you did so, and your reaction is something other than ""oh shit, well that was a complete accident and unintentional and in no way whatsoever do I condone Nazism; I condemn it absolutely"", which is what a normal, well-adjusted, non-Nazi would have said in that situation. I don't consider that ""outrageous"" in the slightest.",Nillavuh,2025-05-04T07:55:57,1848

That’s the issue. They’ve also called President Trump a Nazi, and there was one publication that said He’s … worse than Hitler, Stalin, and maybe Mao combined, but he also is not a violent person, and, in fact, has done a lot to prevent wars and stop wars, which is the very opposite of being a Nazi.”  Don't have to be violent to harm people or to share Nazi ideology.

"Every time Elon Musk gains control over an institution, whether it is a company, a social media platform, or a channel of political influence, marginalized communities face measurable harm. The pattern is consistent, well-documented, and deeply alarming.  At Tesla, the company has been repeatedly sued for fostering a racially hostile work environment. Black employees described being subjected to daily racial slurs, segregated workspaces, and retaliation when they spoke out. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing described the factory as a racially segregated workplace, and federal juries have awarded millions in damages to victims of abuse. Swastikas and nooses were reportedly left visible and unaddressed within the facility. Tesla’s leadership did not take accountability but instead responded with denial and dismissal.  At X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s acquisition led to a significant and well-documented increase in hate speech. Slurs targeting Black, Jewish, and LGBTQ+ communities surged, as confirmed by independent research from organizations such as the Center for Countering Digital Hate and the Anti-Defamation League. Musk reinstated previously banned accounts belonging to white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and far-right conspiracy theorists under the pretext of promoting free speech. At the same time, the algorithm was changed to boost inflammatory and hateful content, leading to the widespread amplification of racism and extremism. In contrast, civil rights advocates and anti-racist voices experienced reduced visibility and engagement.  Musk has not merely tolerated this rhetoric; he has actively endorsed it. He quote tweeted Trump at 14:14 (2:14pm), writing “he who saves his country violates no law” and appended fourteen American flag emojis. The symbolism was NOT SUBTLE. It referenced the “14 words,” a white supremacist slogan that is widely recognized among hate groups. Musk has also promoted debunked race based pseudoscience, including misleading charts suggesting racial disparities in intelligence. He has interacted positively with known white nationalist figures and signal boosted their content to his vast audience. If you look at the bigger picture… these are not isolated lapses in judgment. He clearly demonstrates a repeated pattern of engagement with racist ideologies and communities.  In the realm of Elon’s government policy, his influence extended to the dismantling of vital humanitarian programs. As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk was instrumental in implementing the Trump administration’s drastic cuts to foreign aid, including the near-total defunding of USAID. According to modeling by Boston University, more than 210,000 deaths have already resulted from these cuts, and projections estimate that as many as 25 million people could die over the next 15 years if funding is not restored. Life-saving programs focused on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria have been disrupted or eliminated, disproportionately affecting people of color in vulnerable regions of the Global South. Almost satirically compounding this harm, Musk’s department hired at least four individuals with documented histories of promoting racist or white supremacist content. He also endorsed politicians who dismantled diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, stripping away protections for minority workers and weakening institutional commitments to fairness and accountability.  This PATTERN CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES EXPRESSION OF CONSISTENT IDEOLOGY. Wherever Elon Musk consolidates power, civil rights erode, hate is amplified, and marginalized populations are left to suffer the consequences. The damage is well beyond theoretical. It is MEASURABLE, ONGOING, and UNFOLDING IN PUBLIC VIEW.",anywhoImgoingtobed,2025-05-04T09:20:15,194

"You did the Hitler salute at a Trump ralley. Anyone who denies that it was one is delusional, insincere or motivated by griftership. You support the fascist AfD here in Germany. The AfD has just been labled ""verified right-wing extremist"" by the Bundesverfassungsschutz (our domestic intelligence service that has always been known to be insufficiently informed and aware of right-winged/fascist threats to the public and the state). This means that its positions, plans and actions are proven to be a threat to the Federal Republic Of Germany as a state under the rule of law, as layed out in the Grundgesetz (basic law), our constitution. So much so that banning the party is now on the table. And that considering that the legal hurdles for such actions are very high in Germany\*.   You have also made no amends and not engaged with any of this in any meaningful way. You simply deny your actions and do not take any responsibility for them, playing the victim card where you are a perpetrator that actively works to make this world a worse place for humanity as a whole.   You have made your own bed, now lie in it.  (\*Personally I think that this should have been initiated at least since 2017, when the far-right politician (Frauke Petry) that previously ousted the original founder Bernd Lucke in 2015, was once again ousted by the factions far to the right of her.

But before they had the power to do it, they had to 1st convince ordinary Germans that their neighbors were evil enemies within.

Musk deliberately and loudly sought regime change in multiple NATO allies by funding only the most extremist parties available. Germany is suing him for election interference. He preened for photo opps at Auschwitz while funding and boosting AfD to the point that surprisingly even their members resent his interference. They are literally the closest viable successor to a new German Nazi movement so yeah, the label fits. Trump, his putative boss, is in a war on human rights in the US and worldwide and even provides air support for North Koreans by blinding Ukrainian defenses. To start ‘peace’ negotiations. Totalitarian BS no better than Pol Pot or Stalin or Hitler.   Yeah buddy, that’s why people think you’re a nazi. You do nazi things and play it off like it was a joke like a schoolyard bully who gets caught. You can fool some of the notoriously low info American voters with that, but foreign audiences got the ‘we are new Nazis who will do a nazi soviet style pact with Putin and we want your country to be like us, too’ vibe loud and clear.

">Elon Musk: It Is ‘Outrageous’ to ‘Claim That I’m a Nazi’  Says the guy who did the siege heil  >Joshua Norman Haldeman (November 25, 1902 – January 13, 1974) was an American-born Canadian-South African chiropractor, aviator, and politician. He became involved in Canadian politics, backing the technocracy movement, before moving to South Africa in 1950. Over the course of decades he repeatedly expressed racist, antisemitic, and antidemocratic views. In South Africa he was a supporter of apartheid and promoted a number of conspiracy theories. A pilot since 1948, he died in a plane crash in 1974. Haldeman is the maternal grandfather of businessman Elon Musk.  Now you see where he gets it from.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_N._Haldeman  >In 1941, he resigned from that group and for two years attempted to form his own political party, publishing a newsletter titled Total War & Defence. As an avowed anti-communist, Haldeman objected to Technocracy Incorporated's declaration of support for the Soviet Union following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.Haldeman's son-in-law Errol Musk claimed in 2024 that Haldeman sympathized with Nazi Germany during World War II.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH1U5x8LXgs",amiibohunter2015,2025-05-04T10:49:05,2

The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.”    ― Jean-Paul Sartre",sack-o-matic,2025-05-04T14:55:34,2

Then, when Rolling Stones inquired on this later, Elon's dad is quoted as saying (paraphrasing) ""Elon and his brother had to put on a good progressive/liberal image when they first moved to Canada, and then to California"", because they were going into the silicone valley tech world, who are left leaning. Adding, ""I think he has finally started identifying with his heritage more,"" and that he ""thinks Elon is finally embracing his destiny!""  This is from Elon's father's own words.

"Folks, Elon Musk isn't a Nazi. It's ridiculous to call him a Nazi.  Elon Musk is something far, far worse than a Nazi.  If Elon Musk were a Nazi, he'd be easy for everyone in the world to harshly reject, condemn and minimize. But Elon Musk isn't a Nazi, he's something much, much more dangerous.  Elon Musk has in common with the Nazis: a love of Authoritarianism, a hatred of minority groups, a hatred of women and homosexuals, a hatred of non-white people, a penchant for disseminating disinformation and propaganda through mass media-- and much, much more. Supporting an Administration engaging in Mass Deportations and imprisonments in foreign jails, suppressing Freedom of Speech and the Press, suppression of Due Process. Lots of stuff Nazis also did, this, of course explains why it's so expedient to just call him a Nazi. He's so similar to a Nazi that you can just say ""Nazi"" and a lot of people know what you're sort of saying right away.  But he's not a Nazi. Elon Musk is something much, much worse.  Elon Musk is MAGA which will one day be remembered exactly the same way as Nazis are remembered. The Nazi party was terrifying and powerful, but they existed in a time where the most physical damage they could do was limited by the size of their conventional weapons and the most damage to society they could do was limited by the physical limitations of how many minorities they could murder and imprison.   MAGA has none of these constraints. Donald Trump and his regime control the White House. They have nuclear arms, something Hitler never had. Capable of not just devastating a continent like Hitler did with tanks and bombs but capable of *destroying the World* and permanently devastating all life on Earth.   MAGA also holds the levers of the USA PATROIT Act. Elon Musk's Starlink, existing government surveillance exists not on a national but *global* level. The Nazis had spies, they did not have a pair of eyes and ears in the pockets of every civilian on planet Earth like MAGA has.

"OK, so whatever, he might be a Nazi, I don't care to argue about that.   Here's the scenario I think is *most* likely to be close to the truth.   I think Elom Musk's relationship to Nazi's is like Walter White in the final season of Breaking Bad. I don't think he actually cares about any of their beliefs around  social hierarchies or whatever, I don't think he cares if hes the richest  man among a lot of White guys, black guys, Jewish guys, or whomever.  I think he has his own goals where he views himself as the main character who is going to control the world and bring us to other planets and he doesn't care which group he uses to accomplish that and right now the White supremacists have provided him with the easiest way to exert power, so he'll work with them if he can.   I'd just honestly be surprised if he had any actual strong feelings about any ethnic group. He seems like the type that think the best people are the ones who agree with him and no one is as smart and awesome as him hin his mind.   I genuinely  think hes more likely to think he can use one group of ants against the northern group of ants.   I think the beat evidence of this was his response to the Bannon fight about H1B visas.  He claimed to be willing ot onto war to get more immigrant worker here and he flat out called white Americans stupid.   I don't think he cares about anyone. He thinks this is all a simulation and the rest of may as well just be code. It's only about him getting his save file to  reach the outerspace DLC.",here-for-information,2025-05-04T09:55:33,1

Do people think that he’s always been some undercover, or do people just think he does things that nazis used to do so they just call him a nazi? I’ve seen pictures go around of Volkswagen beetles with hitler in the background, yet those are still okay to drive? I’ve seen pictures go around of what looks like democrats doing the nazi salute (obviously not actually doing it) during speeches like musk did. It’s weird to me to call him a Nazi when he clearly denies it. When I think of nazis, I think of people trying to kill an entire race of people. Elon or trump have never supported killing a race of people or even being racist honestly. I know I’m going to hundreds of comments that link dumb articles that are clearly democrat sided arguments. What about all the good things he does? Democrats love electric vehicles and he makes the best bang for your buck ones. I own 2 different electric vehicles and the Tesla is way better and it was cheaper. What about saving the astronauts? That’s was amazing on its own and they were clearly appreciative of Elon. I understand if people don’t like him, but calling him a Nazi and wishing violence or death on him and even the people that drive vehicles that his company make are insane imo and make it difficult to support the democratic side as much as I want to.

In March, as he was carrying out widespread firings of federal workers, he [shared a post](https://archive.is/o/9vXhe/https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/musk-holocaust-public-workers-union-1235296401/) from an X account that said that Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, and Mao Zedong didn’t cause the deaths of millions of people. Instead, public workers did. After criticism, he removed the post.  He's just explained what the right have been doing all these years to actually cause the divide of party over country:  >“But it is disappointing how well propaganda works,” Musk said. “If you repeat a lie, you know, the sort of ‘he’s a Nazi’ line enough times, some people actually believe it, especially people that still believe the legacy news. So if they still think that what CNN says with the exception of Scott Jennings is true, then, you know, they call me an Nazi on CNN. So if someone believes CNN, then they would say, ‘Oh … that’s an Nazi.’ That’s because they said it on TV. The person on the TV said it.

"The issues with Nazis started before the death camps, which began during WW II; in the 30s, which is the parallel to where we are now, they were ‘just’ concentration and forced work camps, initially for political opponents and later for other ‘undesirables’. Relatively speaking, there were few deaths, though malnourishment was common, because they wanted slave labor more than anything. And these were decried for what they were. When things ramped up during the war, there was a change to extermination, but because of the news blackouts behind the lines, it wasn’t well known outside Germany what was really going on; with the liberation of Dachau and Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, that’s when it all became public.   And early 30s Germany is what Trump, Musk, and all the Project 2025 supporters are trying to enact now. They haven’t quite gotten to “detention without trial”, though they’re pushing hard for it.

He doesn’t seem to recognize how many folks just like him were tried and convicted of war crimes just for ordering or merely inciting their men to carry out such things in the name of their ideology.  In his case it seems to be even worse, arguably, because his techno-authoritarian, pseudo-libertarian views seems to reinforce the insulation he wants to feel from the consequences of supporting these ideologies more than the Nazi’s did. It makes it somewhat more of an attractive ideology to our more violence averse society (relative to back then anyhow).   The Nazis were proudly violent and aggressive. But, ultimately, we saw post-war that the defense of ‘well I didn’t personally take a part in it even if I was in charge’ didn’t fool anyone. Letting the ideology run rampant was enough of a crime in its own right.   It’s a very weak excuse to anyone who isn’t steeped in the same worldview as Elon is. I think he, in equal parts, both wants to believe this, and knows that it is a disingenuous cop out. Deep down though, he must also have some inkling of the fact that history will not look upon him or his ideas favorably. I expect him to get more defensive about that label being applied to him.

"Every once in a while someone on Reddit asks why people are calling them fascists, or what people think fascism really means if they feel justified to make that comparison.   Every time, I reply with a dictionary definition of fascism (see below) because it's boiled down to first principles without rhetoric or even a mention of violence. To date, I have never received a reply or rebuttal. I can't tell if it's a case of [I Wonder Who That's For](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/huh-i-wonder-who-thats-for) meme with a hint of [That Sign Can't Stop Me Because I Can't Read](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/that-sign-cant-stop-me-because-i-cant-read)... but I'd like to think at least some of them might give it a little bit of thought. Of course those tend to be the ones that eventually get banned from new the_donald for not worshipping the orange one like a god.  ----  The Oxford Dictionary defines fascism as: ""an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.""  Webster defines it as: ""a populist political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual, that is associated with a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, and that is characterized by severe economic and social regimentation and by forcible suppression of opposition""",MaryKeay,2025-05-04T09:46:21,82

"No, but if you make the decision to cut off your neighbor's food and healthcare budget and watch them starve or succumb to disease, then you would 100% be responsible.  You're wrong though.  We do owe something.  A little humanity and decency.  Based on your comment, you might be unfamiliar with the concepts.  Just so you're aware, USAID spending accounted for about $40B of the federal budget in 2023.  That sounds like a lot, but let's look at it another way.  It was about half a percent of the federal budget.  Half of one cent from every tax dollar paid in.  That's nothing.  But the goodwill and soft power it established throughout the world is very hard to put a pricetag on.  Additionally, dozens of high level officials in foreign governments started their careers with USAID, and those people tend to remember that when making foreign policies that are favorable to US interests.  But that's gone now.  Even if the budget were fully reinstated tomorrow, it would take years to rebuild those in-roads and return the aid programs to the level they were at in January.    That's the underlying short-sightedness of all of these budget cuts.  Sure, cutting NOAA's or the CDC's or the FDA's budget now might save a few million (or even billion) dollars in the short term, but the lasting effects and the cost and effort required to re-establish will cost orders of magnitude more than what's being saved now, not to mention the immediate harm being done to people who rely on those agencies.  The fishing industry relies heavily on NOAA data, for example.  If they no longer have the budget to collect and publish that data, that's an entire industry crippled and everyone who works in it suffering.

"I love that impact calculator site, though I would note that it appears to be working just on the average deaths per hour. In other words, they figured out the average deaths per hour, and then started multiplying by the number of days since those policies were implemented. That gives us the figure that we see. Having said that, I’m not sure that they could document all those deaths; I don’t believe that the impact counter site has actually gone and verified that people are in fact dying as listed. They just found an average that was true at one point in time, and ran the math.  Still, that seems quite interesting. It does lead to questions. That is, did the deaths begin happening immediately, like the day the aid was removed? 103 people died In the first hour, by the 2nd hour 206 people were dead? Or, was there no one dead on the first day, the second day had a few, but by now it’s really quite a large number, but the average overall is 103 per hour? I don’t know how big the time period is that they are sampling from, I guess.  I would be most pleased if they found the average by looking at every single day since the policies were disabled. I would just really love it if it was as accurate and well researched as possible.

"Beyond it being a morally good thing to do, providing aid to other contries allows for the US to have more power in negiotiating trade deals with those countries as well. It curbs potential problems (regional government unrest, disease, etc.) from potentially affecting the US or it's other partners in the world. Stability is necessary for having a good economy and America cannot gain anything from an unstable country, so preventative aid utlimately helps us in the long run. (Ex: If I give you money to make a business, and you make a massively successful business, you might give me a discount on anything I may need from your business in the future since I did you a good favor).  After WW2, the US became the dominate economic superpower that helped restore stability  since all the other countries, except Russia (at the time named the USSR), were wrecked from the war. Providing aid to downtrodden countries in exchange for favorable deals is what gives the US more wealth and leverage over the world.  When Trump announced the tariffs, he was basically subotaging the good deals we already had with other countries that we were previously providing aid to. By Elon sabotaging USAID, not only are people being disadvantaged, but now other countries have less and less faith in the US business-wise. They're thinking why should they trust a country that already had good deals and is now abruptly bailing out of them to get more deals?  This is why the US dollar is declining, other countries are having less faith in our ability to negiotiate. They don't feel sure about our stability since the USAID is supposed to be an act of good faith.",GCrims,2025-05-04T12:37:34,6

"yes thank you, Walter Musk is never talked about, but he was him and his Cora Robinson, Elon's Grandparents were actual Nazis who lived in Canada and moved back to South Africa despite them being Allied with the Brits at the time which adds to the confusion. Elon would return to Canada with Kimbal and they would also sneak over our laxed Canadian Border and eventually commit immigration fraud to obtain Citizenship. This article by Chris McGreal is really worth a read for background on Musk (and Peter Theil and David Sacks) roots in a very racist Apartheid 1980's that cemented his Nazism in more ways than one.   https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa  ""But for those looking to join dots, there is fodder from Musk’s early life with a neo-Nazi grandfather who moved from Canada to South Africa because he liked the idea of apartheid through his high school education in a system infused with the ideology of white supremacy.  Musk’s formative years in the 1980s came amid a cauldron of rebellion in the Black townships which drew a state of emergency and a bloody crackdown by the state. Some whites fled the country. Others marched with the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement against any weakening of apartheid.  The South Africa into which Musk was born in 1971, and to which Thiel moved as a child from Germany, was led by a prime minister, John Vorster, who had been a general in a fascist militia three decades earlier that allied itself with Hitler.  The Ossewabrandwag (OB) was founded shortly before the second world war. It opposed South Africa entering the war as an ally of Britain and plotted with German military intelligence to assassinate the prime minster, Jan Smuts, as a prelude to an armed uprising in support of Hitler.  Vorster made no secret of his sympathy for Nazi, or National Socialist, ideology which he compared to the Afrikaner political philosophy of Christian nationalism.  “We stand for Christian nationalism which is an ally of National Socialism,” he said in 1942. “You can call this anti-democratic principle dictatorship if you wish. In Italy it is called ‘Fascism’, in Germany ‘German National Socialism’ and in South Africa ‘Christian nationalism’.”  Smuts’s government took a dim view of that and a few weeks later interned Vorster as a Nazi sympathiser.  At the end of the war, the OB was absorbed into the National party, which then won the 1948 election, in which Black South Africans had no vote, on a commitment to impose apartheid. In 1961, Vorster joined the government as minister of justice and five years later became prime minister.   Nazism may have been defeated in Europe but Christian nationalism was alive and kicking in South Africa under Vorster""",origami_bluebird,2025-05-04T13:27:21,11

"Here's my take.   Musk and Bannon both love the admiration and power they get from appealing to the alt right, which absolutely has some Nazis and white supremacists in its ranks. They enjoy both the anger from the left they get promoting these ideas, as well as the power from the influence they garner having sway with those crowds. There is a competition and jealousy between the two.   Elon threw up the salutes to dog whistle the alt right and also troll those on the left. He  also did it in part to mess with Bannon, showing him he can take his power from him if he wants.  You're not going to convince me Elon Musk didn't know what he was doing. I don't think Elon Musk is that much of a moron that he doesn't understand what a Nazi salute is. His response wasn't to apologize It was to make Nazi jokes on Twitter.  Do you genuinely believe that Elon Musk is so ignorant that didn't know what he was doing?  Bannon on the other hand, absolutely made a Nazi salute. He knew exactly what it meant, and knew it was referencing Elon's, and it again was a calculated plan to both appeal to the racists and Nazis in the alt-right, and to be a troll.

"I think I can translate the statement the troll was reacting to. And, FTR, I don’t think it’s trolling, I think it’s just a different perspective of things being labeled white privilege.   1) Something that’s never addressed in America, I can’t speak for the rest of the world, is growing up in an environment where people don’t know if they’re going to survive day to day. The closest thing to a conversation I’ve seen in my decades is season 2 of The Wire. Idk what it was like in apartheid, but I think it’s safe to assume that Elon was on the “don’t really fear for their life daily” side. BUT, living in an environment where one could get murdered at any moment is not only damaging to a person, but to a community, state, country, and now we’re seeing, the world. The fact that it’s never talked about or addressed is sickening, and furthermore, when it’s suggested that offering benefits to people to help them out of this environment, it’s immediately struck down as socialism.    2) The troll, if not AI or anything like that, has most likely been affected directly from the HIV epidemic, and was stating that diseases don’t care what ethnicity someone is, it’s a predator akin to any animal that will feed on mankind. It sounded like a hurt person trying to state that being white doesn’t ever make one immune to disease, especially HIV.

">While Democrats fall far short on addressing the economic issues we are facing  You seem to have answered your own question here, it's the Reagan brand of neoliberalism. Obviously nobody is claiming they're 1:1 identical. However, Dems have been carrying water for Republicans for decades since the Reagan era while advertising themselves as working class champions.  Fact is both parties are corporatist and there is zero daylight between them on tangible, substantive issues that broadly affect the working class. This is why wages have been stagnant since 1980 regardless of who's been in charge, despite a +300% productivity increase thanks to the Internet Age. Corporations, with the passive nod of Dems, sunk those profits into stock buybacks while everything is more unaffordable than ever.

It still requires ignoring reality for it to be true, something people rail against the right for doing.
