"> Not for extreme gerrymandering.   Like voting systems this is a complicated, mathy thing that people have trouble wrapping their heads around.  Ideally we'd have districts decided by some mathematical algorithm that does not consider party or things that are typical proxies for likely votes at all and just balances a couple of core things like maximizing compactness combined with replacing FPTP with approval voting (it's dead simple to explain, already supported by existing voting machines and you don't have to wait until every other vote is counted to know who your vote is counted as a vote for like with some of the other systems).  > Not for voter ID laws.   This is one that makes a lot of sense at a casual pass.  Why shouldn't someone going in to vote have to verify they are who they say they are?  You have to identify yourself for all kinds of other things, after all.  ...and the only real arguments against ot involve Jim Crow and poll taxes and such and people's eyes start to glaze over.

"It's not ""bending over backwards."" Avoiding *even the appearance* of impropriety is, literally, a cannon of US federal judicial ethics.  [Canon 2: A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in all Activities](https://www.uscourts.gov/administration-policies/judiciary-policies/ethics-policies/code-conduct-united-states-judges#c)  > ....(from COMMENTARY to Canon 2A): An appearance of impropriety occurs when reasonable minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances disclosed by a reasonable inquiry, would conclude that the judge’s honesty, integrity, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge is impaired. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges, including harassment and other inappropriate workplace behavior. **A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety.** This prohibition applies to both professional and personal conduct. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny and accept freely and willingly restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited acts, the prohibition is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not specifically mentioned in the Code. Actual improprieties under this standard include violations of law, court rules, or other specific provisions of this Code.  The entire thing is short and well worth a read. Point is that they're not 'bending over backwards' like cowards, they are upholding basic, ground-level professional ethical standards, often in situations where partisan action would have been more expedient, would have better aligned with their personal beliefs, and would have also probably been the more popular action.",StepDownTA,2025-05-06T10:07:45,1

"Absolutely. The general trend for the left to tear itself apart with single issue purity tests is at least as old as the concept of ""Left"" itself.  The French Revolution, where the label of ""Left"" was first used, collapsed into the Reign of Terror over a conflict between factions that almost completely agreed with each other politically.  And a sidenote, the RoT had an *enormous* impact on the early history of the United States. The radical side of American politics (think people like Thomas Paine) were in favor of a bunch of very progressive policies for the 1790s. Things like wealth and land redistribution, women's rights, universal suffrage, abolition, even universal basic income. And they celebrated the early French Revolution as an example of what could happen in other countries when power was fully given to the people like they wanted. But when the idealistic spirit of 1789 collapsed into repression and murder in 1793, Americans were horrified and opinion flipped *hard* on the radicals.  Before that it was possible that they might have led the opposition faction to the Washington (Hamiltonian) administration, who soon became the Federalists. But by the end of the 1790s they were so tarred by the crimes of the Jacobins that they were forced to fold into Jefferson's faction, which was far more moderate.

We’ve been under the thumb of Republican Chief Justices for 72 years. Now, Warren and Berger ended up presiding over very liberal courts because honestly most of the other justices were Democrats during that time (including progressive champions like Douglas).   It helped that FDR and Truman were in office for so long and got to appoint a lot of justices (though FDR didn’t get to appoint his first one until 1937.

The real issue came from the long string of Republicans we had starting with Nixon, especially because we could have had RFK in that position instead. New Deal politics basically died with Bobby.

Some like O’Conner and Souter (who actually joined the liberals against Bush in the 2000 election court case) were okay. Stevens and Blackmun were honestly fairly liberal.

Which is the job of legislation, and why we don't just go ""passed all the laws we need, don't need to to that anymore"". And why the legislature is about more than just budget.  An idea of small c judicial conservatism is that you want those laws enforced and interpreted as written and best practice understood because we want  laws that people can live under with an ideal understanding of when they are breaking the law, or can reasonably look it up when close to the line.  And to make sure laws are consistent with other laws, especially more basic laws and protections.  This is why the wording of a law, recordings of what the original framers of those laws thought they meant, precident of how it has previously been interpreted should all play into how a law is conservatively enforced and not at the whim of the judge. We want Judges as part of that, with compassion to be able to account for situations that all those previous people never thought of. Why we want Judges to have a range of actions at their disposal to handle breaking of laws so they are in line with how much damage is wrought by the breaking. Though sometimes this goes wrong too. Justice is imperfect even in a decent system.  It also the reason for a system of pardons and commutations when things go grotesquely wrong. (though not necessarily how the US does it)  We don't really want creativity from judges. Trying to bend interpretation to what they want beyond any rational that the legislators could have possibly thought they were enacting. Limited in scope, based on rule of law.  We do want a system that can be amended through new legislation and even reasonable changes to a Constitutional or Basic Law. If we are stuck in a monstrosity of grotesque outcomes, we shouldn't be stuck forever with a bad system. How hard that can be to change different countries try to balance.  Now can one get justices who are so Conservative, big C, that they ignore rule of law to enforce cultural values out of step with that small c legal conservatism. Totally.  And I would say that is where we need more Justices willing to engage in good faith with the laws passed, and the system of government as a whole, instead of whim just to help ""their side"".  But the answer isn't Justices who would rule the way we would like, but ones that would best rule according to law and precedent. Leaving Legislation to legislators. (Don't get me started on the evils of Presidential decrees.)",malpasplace,2025-05-05T22:33:21,9
"> Shouldn’t law, in itself, be progressive?  The problem with that idea is that laws are basically written in response to crises. If something happens that is good for people, then you don't need a law to respond to things, you just accept the new status quo. That's how you get unenforced laws on the books.   If something happens that's bad, then politicians can try to fix things by changing the law. Sometimes the law is forward-looking in a way that helps society in the long run, but often it will have unintended consequences, which can be good or bad, that often outlive the intent of the lawmakers.   Look at the discussion of why Democrats didn't do anything to confirm the right to abortions under Obama. A lot of the experts say that it boils down to the fact that it wasn't a crisis, and the threat was not real enough to make the Democrats want to spend the political capital on it. They thought it would give fuel to their opponents in upcoming elections, and the right hadn't been taken away yet.   There's that old canard that armies always prepare to fight the last war, and laws are often the result of the last crisis. You can't expect a progressive mindset from that sort of response mechanism.",SlyReference,2025-05-06T08:07:52,1
"Law has to be relatively fixed in meaning for it to be useful at all.    Circumstances change and a big part of the role of the judiciary is to interpret how the law as written applies to novel situations, not to invent new law whole cloth.  It is the role of the legislature to create, amend or appeal law to change what the law actually says.  And there is generally value in new judges applying the same standards as previous judges because that consistency is part of what gives law value in the first place, but rarely precedent is decided to be wrong and thrown out (see Plessy v Ferguson or Roe v Wade being overturned for two major examples).  Normally that power is limited to higher ranking judges, but SCOTUS is an exception in that SCOTUS can overturn SCOTUS rulings.",Schadrach,2025-05-06T13:02:56,1

"this blinder effect is mostly the product of limited choices. in a multi-party ranked choice system there would be safe avenues of voting against establishment politicians without throwing your vote away, and in such an environment the media would be representing multiple platforms and views rather than pitting every single issue as a simplified left vs right choice.  when you only have two options, and only one of the two is consistent with supporting democracy, it's easy to become passionate about that last remaining option, even if it's a false dichotomy where the house always wins.",wavygrave,2025-05-06T07:49:13,6

"There is no neutral way to interpret the law, and especially not something as short and vague as your constitution is. In some tasks, like simply trying to apply precedents, you can try and reduce your amount of bias, but when deciding whether a law, a decision, or even a precedent was in fact unconstitutional, there will necessarily be some leeway that depends on both the judge's political opinions as well as their own prefered theory of judiciary interpretation (as while these theory are themselves concerned with the amount and kind of leeway a judge should have, choosing one is leeway in and of itself).

"There are several examples of them slowly chipping away at due process. Going all the way back to the '80s, Strickland v. Washington cut back on the right to counsel for criminal defendants.

But can you expand more on why you think the 27th Amendment, which says Congress can't increase its own compensation (i.e. a sitting Congress can only increase the compensation for future Congresses) would have anything at all to do with state laws changing who appoints the members of election boards or whatever?
