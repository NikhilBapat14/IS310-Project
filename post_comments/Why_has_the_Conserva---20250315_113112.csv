"They tied themselves to the trump wagon, using not only his tactics, but just plainly trying to ‘be’ Trump like… even as far as getting close ties to a Canadian billionaire (Shopify) that has been looking to try to be Elon of the North lol…  As soon as Trump made his threats, folks looked at PP and the conservatives and said, FUCK THAT!!!!  Biggest political fuckup in Canada in generations…    Which is fine by me. That fucker PP is an absolute piece of shit. He’s as much a threat to us as Trump.",tkingsbu,2025-03-15T20:35:48,264

"Canadian conservatives have been tying themselves to Trump over the past several years due to shared right-wing beliefs. It's difficult for voters to believe that the party who promoted Trump for years is going to be willing or able to stand up to him if he starts threatening Canada.  When Trump starts threatening to murder Canadians and their families to take their land (and let's be clear, this is *exactly* what threatening to annex Canada against their will implies), it makes him much less popular with Canadians - and any politicians who supported him will also suffer by association.   Tariffs are a lesser concern, but still unlikely to help Conservatives. Foreign threats (rhetorical, economic, or military) tend to increase domestic support of the ruling party in the short-term - this is known the ""Rally 'round the flag"" effect.",tester421,2025-03-15T18:05:22,206
"The threat of the USA annexing Canada has caused the biggest galvanization of Canadian society I have ever seen.  It has been fast and it has been drastic.  Suddenly all of Canada is united like no time since probably world war 2 and that’s no an exaggeration.  Canadians are absolutely incensed and the Conservative Party of Canada did not act decisively to catch the mood of the country and have been reluctant to take strong positions against Trump.  As a result they have lost something like 5-10% of the population who were nominally their supporters but mostly because of opposition to Trudeau.  At the same time, the Liberals have elected Mark Carney as their leader.  He is almost universally respected in Canadian society and regarded as Canada’s best economist (which is hard to argue since he was the Governor of both Bank of Canada and Bank of England).    While Trudeau was regarded as a bit vapid and someone who often virtue signalled over policy and also issued a lot of policies that didn’t further Canada’s economic position; Carney is expected to be solidly focused on nuts and bolts economic issues.  This has largely defanged the Conservative Party of Canada’s policies.  In fact in his leadership bid; he adopted many of the Conservative Parties economic policies and implemented 2 key ones on day 1 of being Prime Minister- removing the consumer carbon tax and rolling back the capital gains tax.  This has caused the complete collapse of the left wing support in Canada-  NDP, Green Party and Parti Quebecois (Quebec separatist support) have basically dropped in 1/2 in the last few weeks - and it’s all gone to the Liberals.  So it’s really been a perfect storm.  By the way, some polls now have the Liberals ahead of the Conservatives in Canada.  So it’s a tidal wave of support that has changed in the last month.",Baulderdash77,2025-03-15T20:01:59,81
"I think it is very much Pierre Poilievre's fault. While he was great as an opposition leader against Trudeau, and managed to score some political points against him, he is essentially an attack dog that is not trained to do anything else.  The recent shift - or rather, earthquake - that took Canadian politics by storm since Trump took office has seen the country pivot from business as usual to what the fuck are we going to do to survive within a few short weeks. This is a moment that calls for serious policy and difficult decisions, but PP has stuck to his style of slandering political opponents with dumb nicknames, claiming the country is ""broken"" and generally refusing to distance himself from MAGAs or to offer serious solutions.  If the conservatives had a more traditional and less extreme leader in this moment, they would undoubtedly fare much better and would stand a serious chance to win. Imagine someone like Harper or Mulroney in his place facing off against Carney... I don't think we would have seen such a dramatic collapse of the CPC in the polls.",the_bolshevik,2025-03-15T21:36:06,17

"Pierre Poilievre is not that liked as much as people were tired of Trudeau. He's a career politician who's principal constituents are Canada's own wealthy elite but he's astute that he's adopted Trump's belligerent hard right campaign tactics; basically railing against ""wokism"", immigrants, and smearing Trudeau instead of really offering any concrete solutions of his own because he has none; and being sympathetic to Trump is not a good look these days.   Carney on the other hand, is a small ""c"" conservative, measured and pragmatic; he's an experienced economist who understands how economies actually work which is what we need now that Trump is trying to kneecap our own.  Carney's also coming in fresh from outside politics; he doesn't have any residual Trudeau stuck to him.   His biggest liability is his spoken French is not up to scratch and may eventually alienate some in Quebec; but right now Quebec is not that keen to be the 51st state either so they're along for the ride.",pomod,2025-03-15T20:28:04,23
"Lots of good answers here on the current political context, so - as a Canadian - I'll give a bit of background/historical context on the Conservative Party of Canada.  Prior to the 1990's, there was one main conservative party - the Progressive Conservatives (PCs), most famously led by Brian Mulroney who was Prime Minister from 1984-1993. Western conservatives - especially in Alberta - were disillusioned with Mulroney's perceived preferential treatment of Eastern provinces, and so they split and made their own tea-party style conservative party - the Reform Party (this split, with PC's being ""eastern conservatives"" and Reform being ""western conservatives,"" still exists in some form to this day). This split helped the Liberals win consecutive majorities, and resulted in the two conservative parties coming together and forming the modern day Conservative Party of Canada (CPC).  The CPC finally unseated the Liberals in 2006, with Stephen Harper being PM until he was himself unseated by Trudeau in 2015. Harper was able to manage the party's internal east-west divide, but after he stepped-down, the western ""reform"" wing of the party became louder, and associated itself more openly with Trumpism. Their current leader is the embodiment of this wing of the party, which has now made it completely unpalatable in the current context.   TL;DR: Western Canadian conservatives are historically more Trumpist, and they rule the only federal conservative party - this makes them unpalatable for Eastern Canadian conservatives, where the votes determine the election.",Minttt,2025-03-15T23:51:32,10
Liberals are benefitting from rally around the flag effect. Conservative leader hasn’t adjusted his messaging and is still beating up on his opponents and also Canada. If the Conservatives immediately threw out their playbook and focused on Trump they’d be in better shape. We just had an election in Ontario where the incumbent Conservative Premier won in a landslide making the election about Trump.,mayorolivia,2025-03-15T19:50:55,11

"In most countries, nationalism/patriotism is a conservative thing. Not in Canada, where the Liberals are more closely associated with defending and promoting a distinct Canadian identity, while the Conservatives are generally more pro-American. So when the major political issue becomes a trade war against the country by a right-wing American government, the Liberals will benefit.",pierrebrassau,2025-03-16T09:09:06,5
Because the conservative leader is in favour of them and want to subjugate Canada to Trump?,betajool,2025-03-15T20:44:33,9
I remember reading that nationalism is right wing nearly everywhere in the world apart from Canada and Scotland. In Canada it is to oppose a right wing USA and in Scotland it is to oppose a right wing UK.   I imagine that the USA threatening Canada has whipped up nationalist fervour in Canada favouring the liberals.,savva1995,2025-03-16T01:17:34,3
"Politics is a game of firsts, if the Liberals say ""fuck Trump!"" and the Conservatives pull up like a week later and say ""yea, fuck Trump!"" it's weaker being second.  Also, it wasn't so much that the Liberals benefited from Trump's specific threats about tariffs and 51st state nonsense, it was just that those threats acted as a useful political diversion and demanded more attention from both politicians, and the general public, compared to the petty squabbling and name-calling between the Liberals and Conservatives.   It was one thing when we could point at Trudeau and be like hey this guys a clown he's screwing up this country and we need someone new. That was a message that PP was able to repeat ad nauseum and get significant buy-in for.   When Trump came along and started talking all this trash, it recentered the focus on Trump and away from the failings of the Canadian Liberals.   Lastly, the Liberals are in a position to actually do something about it currently (opposed to the Conservatives who don't have governmental power) which is another reason they can benefit immediately, by talking about actions they can/will take today, and not what actions might occur post-election.   Trump and his commentary have been the greatest gift the Liberals ever could have asked for in terms of remaining in government and significantly increasing their chances of winning reelection.",Dark_Wing_350,2025-03-16T03:46:29,3

"The Liberal advantage comes down to three key factors: incumbency, Conservative association with Trump, and fundamental campaign message incompatibility.  First, being the party in power during an international crisis gives the Liberals a massive advantage. Trudeau immediately positioned himself as the defender of Canadian sovereignty with his ""We will never be the 51st state"" declarations. The government could take visible action by imposing retaliatory tariffs and coordinating the national response. This created a classic ""rally around the flag"" effect that typically benefits incumbents during international conflicts.  Second, the Conservatives have an uncomfortable Trump association problem they can't easily shake. Polling shows roughly 40% of Conservative supporters actually preferred Trump over Biden (compared to just 2% of Liberal supporters). Poilievre's populist rhetoric shares some stylistic similarities with Trump - he's used phrases like ""fake news"" and criticized the ""radical left"" in ways that made Liberal attack ads showing these parallels quite effective. He's also received endorsements from figures like Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson, who are similarly connected to Trump.  Most damaging, the Conservatives have policy positions that align with Trump on key issues. They were the only major Canadian party to vote against updating Canada's trade agreement with Ukraine, mirroring Trump's decreasing support for Ukraine. Their unqualified support for Israel is closer to Trump's position than the more nuanced Liberal stance. These connections make it difficult for Conservatives to present themselves as Trump's strongest opponents.  Third, the Conservative campaign message was fundamentally incompatible with the moment. Their entire strategy was built around ""Canada is Broken"" under Liberal leadership - a message that suddenly feels unpatriotic when an external threat emerges. They tried pivoting to ""Canada First"" messaging, but faced an impossible dilemma: blame Liberals for provoking Trump (appearing unpatriotic during a crisis), strongly condemn Trump (alienating their base), or stay focused on domestic issues (seeming tone-deaf to the existential threat).  Meanwhile, the timing of the Liberal leadership race gave them a perfect opportunity to present a fresh face with Mark Carney, whose economic credentials make him appear well-equipped to handle a trade war.",erg99,2025-03-16T21:36:33,2
"All of the comments so far have been correct. But I think a major factor is that the Tories have not come out with any meaningful policy. And that is a problem when they are not denying the accusations and the party's history that they want to dismantle, or at least severely reduce, Canada's social institutions and initiatives (health care, education, women's rights, climate).   Canada is truly multicultural. I am not certain there is another country in the world like Canada when it comes to total diversity. The culture of the country is very complex, which makes a common identity challenging to identify and define. Accordingly, many citizens put a lot of value in the social institutions, from which they derive a common identity, in particular, health care. Privatization is a very heavy word in Canada, and when it appears the Tories are focussed on that and are not presenting policy that dispels that concern, it is discouraging to the general voter.",numbrate,2025-03-15T21:16:45,4

The Liberals are the more left wing party so even though Poliviere scrambled and tried to denounce the tariffs/51st state stuff it still plays against him. In addition that attempt to salvage it made him less popular with far right and made him look more what he is which is just a career politician who's saying whatever it takes to get elected. The real Canadian version of a Milei type guy would be Bernier. There is no party with real Trump beliefs in Canada as it's overwhelmingly moderate left. The Conservatives tried running a guy with the same views as Trudeau last time and it didn't work so they're trying a more right wing strategy this time. It is pretty hollow. I think Carney will win minority government and then Polievre will stay and eventually win in like 2-3 years since the Liberals will have been in a long time and Carney is pure World Economic Forum type globalist making him a good target for people on the right.,RusevReigns,2025-03-16T18:53:30,1

Every successful politician needs their ardent believers to proselytize to the rest of their less engaged supporters.   PP is walking a very thin tightrope right now where he's trying to publicly appeal to moderates with pro-Canadian rhetoric, while trying to wink at his biggest fans who know its just a show to win office.   But if he were to genuinely oppose Trump, believably, he might attract moderate conservatives again, but he risks pissing off or even alienating his pro-invasion base. I'm not sure he can make it across that tightrope.  Honestly if the CPC wants a real shot at this race, I think he needs to step down and let Ford or even Smith run the party.
