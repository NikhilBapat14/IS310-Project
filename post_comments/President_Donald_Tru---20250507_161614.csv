From her wiki page:  >Casey Means (born September 24, 1987)[1] is an American functional medicine/holistic medicine physician, entrepreneur and author.  Hmmm, what type of medicine is “functional medicine”?

"Saw a doc like this, I never understood why they can keep their MD. credentials when they start to go into pseudo science. I directly talked to the doc about it and asked why I should try a treatment that is illegal in many states and defined as pseudo science? His answer?

"Errrr…. You’d be surprised how many of the “journals” you read online are just doctors writing what they’ve observed about a small sample of their patients, or even an individual patient. Journals range from the complex and revolutionary to the mostly mundane observations. It’s why the common person shouldn’t read them and jump to conclusions. Most people searching through them just find the key words they are looking for in an article, read the abstract and don’t really understand process, observations or the conclusion.",Artistic-Law-9567,2025-05-07T17:52:41,-3
