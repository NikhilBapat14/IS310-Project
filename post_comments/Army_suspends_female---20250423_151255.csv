"I‚Äôm military, 12 years in. No matter how much we hate them (and I do fucking hate them) we have to display their pictures on the chain of command boards, HOWEVER, to say this is solely her fault is crazy. I cannot tell you how many memes I‚Äôve seen of the president as a WHOLE ORANGE or something dumb, like riding a horse on these boards. Some pictures are obviously shitting on him and some idolizing him, either way, it‚Äôs unprofessional and shows a lack of discipline. 9/10 the command teams didn‚Äôt do this and they are corrected on the spot and someone‚Äôs ass is getting chewed. It‚Äôs usually done by some lower enlisted Soldier.   Unless I am missing something (and if I am please let me know), she didn‚Äôt direct anyone to do this or do it herself‚Ä¶ to say she wasn‚Äôt relieved because of this is a whole fucking lie. This situation sparked media and went crazy‚Ä¶ I put money on the fact she was suspended over this. If they are doing an investigation and find out she in fact did it, the UCMJ does have articles that justify her being relieved of command, for example, it is ‚Äúunbecoming of a Soldier‚Äù (in other words lack discipline etc etc). So I don‚Äôt see the reason for these mfs to cover it up and say it‚Äôs something else.   To add, for the DOD and SECDEF to even post about this is extremely fucking crazy to me. They have every right to handle it, but just know, that is NOT how the military goes about shit.   I fucking hate the SECDEF.",dvx6,2025-04-23T16:52:14,36

If someone with the qualifications comes into the unit, you'll be pulled out the spot and shuffled somewhere else. If that's what they're calling a suspension, than that happens all the time and is an administrative thing. I don't think this is what happened but that is how someone in the reserves can be ""suspended"" (actually relieved is the proper term) without misconduct.

"Anytime an army leader, in a slotted leadership position like commander, is under investigation they are essentially removed from their position while the investigation is underway. The unit installs an acting commander (who is usually someone who was a subordinate) until the investigation is complete. If the investigation is founded the commander may be officially relieved and replaced.   It‚Äôs essentially the same thing as someone being placed on administrative leave, similar to what you hear about cops during investigations. Except she will still likely report to someone daily and have to meet with the investigator.   What‚Äôs occurring to her is pretty standard and if the investigation is unfounded then she‚Äôll return to the position. But, if this is a political witch hunt, then it‚Äôs irrelevant if the investigation is unfounded. After the investigation she will be quietly told that her career will progress no further and it would be in her best interest to step down as commander and retire. Most soldiers in similar situations would choose the retirement rather than fighting back, even if they know they were wronged.",hamburgernade,2025-04-24T05:37:58,1

This is the type of stuff that could turn the military against a president, and as much as I hate Trump, I really don't want to see a military coup either. I think we are a long way from that point, but the US military is just not used to politicians interfering into an issue like this that would normally be handled internally.

"Hmmm, could be a few things.  The most common is when a situation is being investigated, and they do not want a commander to be able to influence the investigation by continuing to exercise authority. In which case, she is not suspended for misconduct (because they haven't actually concluded one way or another), it's just an administrative suspension while the investigation proceeds. However, that means that the administrative suspension could end up becoming a Relief for Cause due to misconduct.  However, there are other possibilities, I believe physical fitness standards could warrant an administrative suspension. It's not unheard of for higher ranking officers or NCOs to have someone pencil whip a PT test for them once they start getting older and too many things are sore. Someone could have demanded that she pass a PT test or could have demanded that she show that she was within regs for height/weight standards. That could be used by someone antagonistic to her or someone sympathetic to her as a way to remove her from the situation for neutral reasons.  ETA: Also, she could end up getting a Relief for Cause for poor performance.

">Why is it then the Democrats want to tear down statues, rename forts, and erase history?   I think the first two are accurate; the third not so much. Finding out your ""heroes"" are horrible criminals isn't something Democrats want taught or celebrated. No one wants to admire the statue of Ted Bundy or attend Lee Harvey Oswald Collegiate or go to Fort Calley. It's the honor associated with having a fort or a statue named after you that shouldn't go to people who aren't worthy of that honor. Plus, they also don't want to pay for the cleanup of these statues once people know how awful these people were. The Democrats AFAIK don't want the statues necessarily destroyed but rather moved into a museum into a proper place where their crimes or their horribleness can be better explained.  History erasure comes with book bans, something Democrats don't do. It came when the Civil War was painted as a sad thing, but no one was made to feel bad for being part of the Confederacy.

America had a long history of putting up statues specifically to intimidate former-slaves.  The goal was to say, ""we're still in charge, even if you can vote"". Those awful effigies were primarily what was being pulled down during that one news cycle.     Statues arent just there to remind people about the events surrounding the individual.

"I was also an NCO, and I worked in communications security. When the story about the signal chat first broke, it absolutely blew my mind. I knew Trump's staff was dumb, but this is like robbing the donut shop across the street from a police station level of stupid. One aspect of the situation that I don't hear discussed often is the fact that before Hegseth shared that info on the chat, he would have had to transfer it onto his phone from a computer on a top secret network. That is a MASSIVE no-no. He would have had to either taken a picture of the info with his personal phone or transcribed it.   If a regular soldier had done that and then shared it on an unsecured chat, they would absolutely be in military prison by now. It's a clear of a case of disclosure of classified information. That info was shared on multiple unsecured devices, one of which was in Russia and was likely being monitored. His arrogance and stupidity put service members' lives in danger. I think Hegseth should have been relieved immediately and should be sitting in jail right now.  As for how most of the military feels about it, I can't say for sure. Like the general public, many service members don't really follow the news closely and may not have heard about it or only heard about it through the Fox News spin. For those who have heard the whole story, they would likely see how obviously wrong it is. The military tends to vote Republican though, and I'm sure many have found reasons to rationalize not holding Hegseth responsible for his actions. It's a large and diverse force, though.

As far as how the military would feel about it, I'll say that if Hegseth were 100% politically neutral and if his performance and success had no bearing on either side's political success, I don't think anyone would make excuses for him or claim that the Signal situation didn't warrant removal. I'll say that I never heard anyone in my time in the military give Hilary a pass on using a private email server.

Plus Democrats have been more likely to make cuts to the military over the years than Republicans. So, it's about a 60/40 split in favor of Republicans.",SereneDreams03,2025-04-24T09:11:40,1
"No problem, I'm glad they helped.  I've noticed a similar problem as the one you mentioned: too many folks want to show how funny/snarky they can be and it gets hard to get actual information when you have a real question and want a real answer.
