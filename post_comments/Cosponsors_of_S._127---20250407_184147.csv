"What's to stop the president from ignoring it?    He's been free to ignore the budget set by Congress and shut down agencies created by Congressional acts.     He will just keep doing what he's doing.   He could pull some random old law off the books.  For example: claim we are ""at war"", and insist the President gets to do these things ""during war"".   If you oppose him setting tariffs, you must want the US to lose ""the war"".   The judicial branch could try to rule that the president can't keep changing tariffs.  He ignores the judge.  What are they going to do?   He can't be charged with a crime.  He controls the DOJ, US Marshalls, and FBI.    The last judge who ruled against him angered him enough he threatened to have the judge impeached.    At what point does he cross over into being a dictator?",ProtozoaPatriot,2025-04-07T20:12:10,1

"Well, you have to write a check to pay tariffs, and the government can sue you if you don't. So if you don't, and the government tries to sue you over nonpayment of tariffs which Congress cancelled, the court will dismiss the case with prejudice.",Competitive_Travel16,2025-04-07T20:18:44,1
