"Voters reap the consequences of their own actions.  More at 11.  If Americans want to learn the hard way, China and the world are probably happy to oblige to some extent.  Americans will feel real pain, and there won’t be easy escape.  Getting stuff back into the country will take time.  Time for deals ran out a few weeks ago.  Now it’s just a question of how much pain will there be and if the Mad King will finally be opposed.",teamdiabetes11,2025-05-01T12:33:42,7

We can just transfer addictions from the consumption of cheap Chinese products to the consumption of all-American liquor and cannabis. America's no longer the leader of the world. Time to relax.,30mil,2025-05-01T12:52:12,5

"Imagine a French soldier circa 1942.  Did they deserve to live under Nazi occupation?  I don’t think the answer depends on how well or poorly they acted as a soldier.  France as a nation failed to defend themselves against invasion, and so they were invaded.    There are challenges that are bigger than what someone does as an individual, those challenges can only be met by a higher level of organization.  A town facing a rising river.  A region facing an infectious disease.  Humanity facing climate change.  We meet those challenges together, or we fail.  In 2024, America failed.",NewMidwest,2025-05-01T16:06:09,1
