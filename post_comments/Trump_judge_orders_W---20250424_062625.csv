"Narcissistic people like Trump thrive on projected power. He wants us to believe that he‚Äôs untouchable, and they work very hard to construct narratives that push such an idea.  It‚Äôs, I think, partly why there‚Äôs this need for *public humiliation* in Trumps inner circle. Like, as someone who may have been a career politician who was in some regard respectable, you‚Äôre faced with an environment now where the longevity of your continued career is defined by how far you can bend the knee and how many mooches you can give the ring. It‚Äôs natural for that to be humiliating, and yet it‚Äôs seemingly a requirement. They need people around Trump who support the image of power he constructs.  Look to the tariffs. Trump said he wasn‚Äôt backing down. But the bond market became ‚Äúyippy,‚Äù and so he folded. We have found Trumps limit there (albeit, a damn far and scary limit). Us knowing that limit is bad for Trump. Trumps strategy requires that we believe he does not have a limit, so that we behave accordingly.   A little beside the point but just to cut even deeper into that example; he wants businesses to treat his tariffs like they‚Äôre a permanent part of integrating with the US economy now. One of the rhetorics he gave was, it should help bring manufacturing jobs back to the US. That‚Äôs obviously not going to work when your plan is fundamentally flawed though, because businesses look to his tariffs and only see uncertainty for the market. They rightfully don‚Äôt trust that Trumps tariffs are worth basing long term decisions on. Instead, they see the tariffs as reason to hold off on long term decisions, spending, and thus: an economic recession is a concern.  Back on point, we need to keep pushing. We have to keep finding where Trumps limits are, so that we can exploit them. You say that Trumps team doesn‚Äôt care about the points I‚Äôve raised, but I‚Äôd argue we‚Äôre pushing things yet further and we haven‚Äôt checked those limits yet. Let‚Äôs check those limits and keep pushing‚Ä¶ this is attrition, not a smoking gun. More important than that though, and contrary to the idea that Trump is all powerful; this is something, not nothing, that we can do.",DuckDatum,2025-04-24T10:50:59,12

"Sorry but his inner circle isn't much different compared to Trump and his voters. They simply don't care, especially since nobody can force him or *them* to do anything. And that is kinda projection of power - he and them *can* do anything, no matter what supreme court tells them. It's just noise in wind they can mock. Not to mention his and their insane delusion. They very likely won't see that Trump folded like wet paper, because it's really not that much relevant since he earned them billions directly onto their pocket while their fanbase are refusing to accept reality.   TLDR: He still has all power they need to have to turn US into fascist state. And well, that's all power they need or care about.",TheEmpireOfSun,2025-04-24T11:05:53,2

I'm not advocating delayed justice I'm just pointing out the reality of the situation. The courts are clogged because the republicans won't fucking fund them correctly or expand them by adding judges. I had to wait 2 years to get a civil court date because criminal cases were correctly taking priority. That doesn't' change that they are backed up.  We should just let people do human trafficking instead?,bungpeice,2025-04-24T11:00:20,1
"Pretty confident that a case that credibly accuses federal agents of kidnapping American residents / citizens in an ongoing manner would quickly rise to the top of the docket. I'm guessing your civil court case wasn't as significant.  My stating that cheering the ""benefits"" of a backlog isn't great doesn't even come close to ""letting people do human trafficking.""",mitrie,2025-04-24T11:12:08,2
"I'm not cheering the benefits. I'm pointing out that the reality of the system would force their hand and they would be forced to defend the behavior in court over and over. Likely admitting to breaking laws because this administration is fucking incompetent and engaged in illegal activity.  They don't deserve special treatment, this is what everyone who gets involved in the US justice system has to deal with, and I was pretty clear that criminal cases were taking priority over my civil case for good reason.     Do I think the system should be better, yes. Am I going to wring my hands over the people forcing others in to that system getting a dose themselves. Nope.",bungpeice,2025-04-24T11:14:32,1
"Ok, I took your saying ""I doubt liberal districts would be super excited to expedite the process"" to mean that you see benefit in slow-rolling the justice process. I take that as a separate issue from bringing many cases. If that's not what you intended, then we're probably in agreement.",mitrie,2025-04-24T11:17:38,1
I meant that it will take forever because it takes forever and I don't think liberal courts will be very excited to give them special treatment.,bungpeice,2025-04-24T11:19:16,2
"Ok, I guess that I do still disagree with you. If a criminal human trafficking ring is out publicly talking about the huge number of people they're moving and that they are planning to keep it up, or even better, up the volume,  then I'd expect those criminal cases to be prioritized in the court to put a stop to it.",mitrie,2025-04-24T11:23:35,1
"Special treatment is different than prioritization. They are off the street or released under supervision and why does that take priority over other heinous crimes. Should interstate drug traffickers who have been killing kids with fent get pushed back when those peoples parents have been waiting for justice? How about human traffickers that have been selling people in to sexual slavery.     If a crime is in federal court it is because it is really fucking bad. There is a massive problem with prosecuting rape on reservations because the only courts with jurisdiction are federal and often they won't take the cases because they have ""bigger fish to fry""",bungpeice,2025-04-24T11:25:49,2
"Frankly, yes. A serious contention that the government agent is committing state sanctioned criminal acts is so much more significant than any other individual criminal case that it needs to be priority #1, with any reasonable actions taken to get a verdict as soon as possible. This is all pretty irrelevant anyway though, I have zero confidence in a criminal case against an ICE agent surviving immunity assertions.",mitrie,2025-04-24T11:33:26,1
So again you are arguing for just letting it happen because you think justice is unlikely instead of forcing them to defend the behavior under oath and forcing them to rethink their tactics because their agents keep getting arrested.,bungpeice,2025-04-24T11:34:58,1

"I am referring to the civil cases in Boasberg's (Trump v JGG) and Xinis's (Noem vs Garcia) courtrooms. From a realistic viewpoint, those are the cases that are likely to stop these actions. I assume you're asking about civil cases against individual agents. I agree those don't exist.   We're clearly just arguing past each other at this point, and I'll give you the chance to have the last word. I'll close with saying that the whole reason I commented in this thread was to ask whether or not state criminal charges would plausibly withstand any immunity claim (be it Supremacy Clause or Qualified Immunity). I've betrayed my thoughts on the matter by stating in my most recent post saying that I don't think a case would survive. As you have said, acknowledgement of a reality doesn't mean support of what it represents.",mitrie,2025-04-24T12:28:32,1
That depends on whether or not you think Trump will respect the ruling. So far he hasn't. Also I don't think the scope of those rulings will end up being as sweeping as you think.  Instead of going top down you go bottom up. Increase the risk for enforcers as trump has zero liability due to the supreme court immunity ruling.,bungpeice,2025-04-24T12:39:53,1
You see what is happening with this judge today? This is exactly why you go bottom up and bring justice to those who you can at every moment. If others are out of reach you prosecute those who are in reach. They would think twice about openly doing fascist shit like this if there were immediate consequences.,bungpeice,2025-04-25T12:55:23,1
That's an approach. It was also clearly directed by the head of the FBI. Going after him would be a top down approach that would also be effective.  There's not a one size fits all solution here.,mitrie,2025-04-25T13:07:03,1

"...  They're not. How is Wisconsin going to hold someone criminally accountable for executing a lawful order given by a federal agency superior? There is absolutely corrupt / chilling intent, but there is an alleged crime that occurred. It's an abuse of power, but seems legal, which is exactly the problem with fascists. They utilize the tools and protections of a democracy / legal system to their advantage and ignore it when it's inconvenient.   What exactly are you suggesting Wisconsin charge the FBI agents with in this case? In the case that spawned this whole discussion taking people against their will, imprisoning them, and in some cases transporting them across international borders all without trial could pretty easily meet the elements of a kidnapping / human trafficking case. What's the actual crime here?  We're either a rule of law country or we're not. If we're not, then we shouldn't be looking to the legal system for our solutions...",mitrie,2025-04-25T14:02:17,1

"Thanks. You didn't answer the question. I understand what the state charges would be in the case of the immigrants, kidnapping / human trafficking. I don't understand what the charges would be in this case. False arrest? Assuming the FBI wasn't dumb enough to do this without getting the minimally required probable cause to support their claim, that wouldn't hold up.  Again, if you just want to use the legal system to fuck with the fascists because that's what they're doing, I understand the notion, but if that's the case you shouldn't act like it's significantly better to use trumped up charges to win. Rule of law should prevail.  As I said yesterday, I'm done with this conversation.
