We were the dominant power when the global economy bloomed and could have leveraged that dominance for a century to come. The fulfillment of prophecy that we all knew was inevitable with this moron has now come to bear.,theombudsmen,2025-04-25T14:52:01,43
"No, MAGA killed the goose that lays the golden egg.  Everything about the old system was skewed toward American interests.    But Trump destroyed that system so that he could play world-wide extortionist , like some kind of demented comic book super villain.    But the world is not playing and no one is ""negotiating,""  that is paying protection money to Trump.     So the goose is dead and Trump has little or nothing to show for destroying it because he is an imbecile and too stupid to know that the world was never going to pay him protection money to get his moronic  tariffs lifted.   And all that blabbering about 200 deals?  It's hard to imagine the kind of stupidity it takes to believe anything a felon convicted of fraud with more than 50,000 documented lies to his credit says about anything.  But I have to concluded such people exist...",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-25T15:03:47,43
"*From Bloomberg News reporter Edward Harrison*  President Donald Trump’s ""America First"" economic revolution has quickly turned into ""America Last"" as far as financial markets go.      With the US’s economic prospects waning, free movement of capital is becoming an Achilles’ heel as investors of all stripes start to flee US assets. If Trump persists, it threatens to cause an extended bear market and a financial crisis.

"The economic hand wringing is funny… “if Trump stops, things will go back to normal.”! Hahah… it’s as though you think a late reversal will make every country forget America relished in flexing on the rest of us. Trump isn’t getting deals. Even if he capitulated and offered a return to pre-idiot normalacy, that’s off the table. America will have to address its stupidity… you elected a foreign agent who has successfully ruined your leadership in the world. The rest of us, we are moving on without you.",NoPresent9027,2025-04-26T04:17:19,3
"And it shouldn't come back. The world gave us the opportunity to correct the direction we were going before real damage and harm is caused, but we doubled down and sprinted in the wrong direction. Now the world has collectively decided to move on without us, and and future American participation will be viewed with suspicion.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-25T15:21:37,5

"If Trump was removed from office tomorrow I doubt that it would halt the giant snowball hurtling down the slope and demolishing the chalet.   It is not just the case of a mad king. The constitution has been gamed to death and the nation has devolved into a dysfunctional failed state.   The rule of law has been eroded to the point that government is now ignoring court orders and judges are being arrested in their chambers.   The fundamental weaknesses of the constitution and the electoral system has had a truck driven through them.  There is no apparent means by which it can be put back together again.   The erosion of trust and confidence in the USD and Treasury bonds , should it continue on a downward trajectory ,means that should the US enter economic recession it will lose its ability to be first in and first out as it has done so often before.  Losing its ability to attract foreign investment in the US as a safe haven will hinder its ability to recover from economic recession and a crash of the USD puts it in great risk of default.   If anyone can bankrupt the USA it is the six time bankrupt felon in the WH.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-25T19:26:10,3

">  Trump was always the endpoint, and progressives saw it coming in the 1960s.  In the 50's, using McCarthyism they destroyed the left and far left without suffering the blame successfully making it all about one man, McCarthy.
