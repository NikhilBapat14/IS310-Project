"Echoing what others are saying. This country is full of ignorant, horrible people. Let's not pretend Trump came out of nowhere.  I'm going to echo George Carlin here:   ""Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well, where do people think these politicians come from? They don't fall out of the sky. They don't pass through a membrane from another reality. They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses and American universities, and they are elected by American citizens. This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It's what our system produces: Garbage in, garbage out. If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're going to get selfish, ignorant leaders. Term limits ain't going to do any good; you're just going to end up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So, maybe, maybe, maybe, it's not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here... like, the public. Yeah, the public sucks. There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody: 'The Public Sucks. F*ck Hope.""",BRich1990,2025-05-07T06:24:01,365

"Here's the thing:  No matter what, \~30% of the electorate are die-hard Trumpers.  They love his brashness, lack of respect for institutions and education, crude language, and cruel treatment of others.  I know plenty of these people personally.  They simply don't care about policy in meaningful form and will continue to support Trump and Trumpist candidates as long as he occasionally mentions their grievances.  Altogether, this means it is impossible for any Republican anywhere in the country to meaningfully stand up to him in any form (regardless of whether this means opposing one of his policies that are actually extremely unpopular with voters) and not risk losing to a Trumper in the primary.  The thing is, this group has shown that it won't turn out if Trump isn't on the ballot (see the 2022 and 2018 midterms).    The other \~20% of the electorate that votes for Trump and Republicans obviously dislike him personally and might even disagree with the tariffs, mass deportations without due process, and pardoning of January 6th rioters, but will continue to vote Republican because of a variety of wedge issues: guns, abortion, ""the border"", and ""lower taxes"" (unfortunately, they don't realize this means lower taxes for the 1% and higher taxes on essentially everyone else).  These people aren't stupid or cruel but they are either brainwashed or simply extremely selfish and short-sighted.    All things considered, I don't think most Americans are actually as cruel as Trump.  Yes, 30% of the electorate is obviously in love with this shit, but even more of them simply don't care about anything, or are brainwashed into believing things that are objectively not true or important should influence their voting habits above all else.",AlG9220,2025-05-07T13:46:23,1

"You are correct sir, I got too much in my feels over the loss of our technical aid missions abroad which was most of my career.  Immigrants have been and are the cornerstone of the U.S.’s success as a country.  They are my ancestors and so many other ancestors who came to the US for opportunities or to escape persecution most often not for themselves but for their children and their children’s children and so on.  They take the shittiest jobs and work them hard and well so their children can have a chance of getting a “better” job and the momentum gains through generations all while moving the economic machine forward and keeping prices low for businesses.  They have been abused by the owners of said businesses since the beginning of our country and now when a political party fights to give them protections previously unheard of, all the screaming racists and bigots focus in on the small relative percentage of bad apples with no reflection on how there are bad apples in every single demographic in our country and have demonized these people who have sacrificed everything at the shot of a better life.  The absolute hypocrisy of it is sickening given how many people who support this crackdown are only a couple to several generations away from their immigrant ancestors or if you think about it we are all the descendants of immigrants with the exception of the Native American population.  The unearned entitlement makes my head want to explode.  Democrats leaders, republican leaders, and judges need to stand up and say no to this unconstitutional and unethical approach to immigration and once that is done put the time and effort necessary for actual reform that treats people as people as defined in our constitution and laws.  You are not Christian and/or a law abiding citizen if you support the current approach.

"No, they couldn’t have. Because the murderer in my analogy isn’t Trump; it’s Trump voters. There’s nothing those non-voters could’ve done to physically stop people from voting for Trump. Trump is an objectively and obviously horrible person and leader. Anyone who can actively and willingly vote for him is clearly far more of a problem than someone’s who’s just too lazy to be bothered to go vote.   These comments also make the assumption that a vast majority of the non-voters would have voted for Harris. I’ve seen very little evidence to suggest that this demographic wouldn’t be more-or-less as evenly split as everyone else was. A handful of tweets of people saying they didn’t vote for Harris to stick it to the Democrats isn’t proof that non-voters are a vast reserve of lazy Democrats.   Also, if you’re from WV, you should really understand how many people’s votes (for president) simply don’t matter. Because of the electoral college, your vote for president effectively doesn’t count unless you live in a swing state. And places like WV aren’t even close enough to dream that even a 100% turnout could flip the state. Sure, they still should show up to vote for local elections, and may as well cast a ballot for president while they’re there. But a left-leaning voter in WV who saw how overwhelmingly pro-Trump the state is and decided they have better things to do because their vote quite literally can’t flip the state isn’t on the same level as a left-leaning voter in Pennsylvania who couldn’t be bothered even though the margins were actually close. And even in PA, non-voters wouldn’t be so much of an issue if we didn’t have such a big issue of people deranged enough to actually vote for Trump.",ToastyJackson,2025-05-07T08:59:26,4
"Trump is an objectively terrible person and leader. Even back in 2016, there weren’t any valid reasons to vote for him. Anyone who can look at somebody like him and feel inspired to vote for him is very obviously far more of an issue than someone who’s simply too apathetic or lazy to vote. If nobody votes at all, nobody wins. If only one person votes, and they vote for Trump, Trump wins. There’s a very clear concrete difference between the impact of not voting at all and voting for Trump. People who just didn’t feel like voting can be more easily inspired to and to see reason. But there’s something very wrong with people who actively vote for Trump—whether because they actually think he’s a good option or because they’ve been very thoroughly brainwashed. I’m not saying you can’t criticize non-voters, but equating non-voters to Trump voters serves the purpose of defending and sanewashing the people who actually think Trump is a good option, and idk why so many liberals are so dedicated to doing that.",ToastyJackson,2025-05-07T09:27:42,1

"Christ, I’ll drop the analogies. Trump’s supporters are doing shit like cheering about sending people to a concentration camp to a foreign country. Some of his voters may just be ignorant, but we’ve known for a long time now that many of his supporters are quite literally just the worst people America has to offer. The people who didn’t vote out of laziness were just lazy or apathetic. Saying these groups of people are exactly the same isn’t simply insulting non-voters by saying that they’re just as harmful as Trump voters; it’s conversely minimizing and defending Trump voters by saying that they’re no more harmful than people who didn’t vote when that’s very obviously not true.   The whole “he who is silent sided with the oppressor” is fine when looking back at history, but when you’re actually living in the historical times, it’s far more practical to just ignore the people on the sidelines since they aren’t doing anything anyway or to try to get them to join you. We’re currently not even winning the fight against the actual Trump voters, so I don’t know why so many people are so eager to go to war with the non-voters at the same time. Especially if you want any chance of getting them to vote with you in the future. Historically in America, telling apathetic people that they’re literally exactly the same as fascists hasn’t been an effective strategy for winning hearts and minds.",ToastyJackson,2025-05-07T11:48:14,1
