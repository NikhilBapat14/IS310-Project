"NYTimes had a great article on this subject a few years ago. Basically they said conservative people were that way because they have a tendency to fear the unknown/change, and on the other end of the spectrum, liberal leaning people are interested in change, the unknown, new things.",ObjectiveNinja279,2025-05-06T23:33:07,20
"I have a theory unsupported by evidence. I think people who watch local news channels are exposed to news about crimes that occur more locally in inner city urban areas to a greater extent than people who follow national news more exclusively. This leads to the local news consumer to have the perception that urban areas are dangerous, and riddled with crime. Those who consume national news don’t get those stories and tend to think they are exaggerated out of proportion.",Cluefuljewel,2025-05-06T23:31:14,16
"Newt Gingrich was interviewed at the 2016 Dem National convention, where he was asked to comment on the Dem plan to address crime.   The interviewer told him the FBI crime stats showed crime much lower than where most Americans thought it was… and to this Newt said that actual stats are irrelevant… that only the perception matters and Americans think crime is up.  The crime epidemic is fake. It is a racial dog whistle. Republicans know this and they depend on to win elections.   (Wow this was way easier to google than I expected. Here’s a link to the interview: https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2016/08/05/newt-gingrich-exemplifies-just-how-unscientific-america-is/)",rangkilrog,2025-05-06T23:54:10,28
"Yeah republican elites lie and exaggerate it when it fits their narrative so it skews perceptions, for example migrants commit the same or even less in some studies crime than citizens, yet they justified the most aggro military crackdown America has ever seen on immigrants by lying that there was a “migrant crime wave” and turning every individual crime into part of some alleged broader trend  It’s not ideal, and it should probably be illegal to just lie like that openly on tv 24/7 but I guess we’ve decided it’s alright if a few elites are allowed to lie endlessly then ruin everything for everyone with dictatorship vibes lol",smartcow360,2025-05-06T23:55:28,8

"My inlaws are retired and spend a majority of their time scouring Facebook for reports of shocking crimes happening somewhere in America.   They feel strongly that crime has risen and that crime in cities is out of control.  They no longer are willing to have dinner with my wife and I in our city's entertainment district.    They feel strongly that Trump is the greatest force of law and order in their lifetime.  The falseness of this isn't important to them because they say everyone can have their own truth, and they feel that believing this is important to their online tribal community.   So to answer your question, yes absolutely.  But it is probably more about information bubbles than some sort of inherent character trait.",tag8833,2025-05-07T08:54:38,3
"You have to be specific with regards to the type of crime.  Most people are concerned about violent crime and bad news travels fast.    Progressives think the US is full of guns and everyone is at risk of getting shot while Conservatives think their world is full of criminals who wouldn't be in the country if it weren't for ""bad"" border policies.  Reality is somewhere in the middle.     Bad news sells, hyperbole/exaggerated news sells.",JKlerk,2025-05-07T07:41:10,2
The “truth” I see regarding crime is how it affects me and those around me.  In the last 5 years it has gone down some.  Property crime is still considerable and drugs are the largest issue (serval kids have died from OD’s lately).  Violent crime has not been an issue where I live.  There is so much “noise” round reporting of crime that I just stopped listening.,mcgunner1966,2025-05-07T11:27:48,2
"The nature of crime has changed a great deal over my lifetime. It is far less violent than it used to be, society itself has become far less violent.  When I was a boy in school, in the 50s and 60s, violence was expected, it was considered part of ""growing up"", school fights were rites of passage that the teachers either ignored or encouraged. Ethnic gangs ""protected"" their neighborhoods from other gangs. Bar fights were far more common, frequently turning into general donnybrooks. Such fighting was considered fun and exciting. The experiences of WWII had inured men to violent behavior. Millions of veterans with undiagnosed PTSD simply accepted violence as a fact of life, and the adrenalin junkies used fighting to get their fix. Parents could beat their children with impunity, husbands could beat their wives, under the theories that a man's home was his castle, and what happened behind the closed doors of a home was nobody's business but the man's.    As the 60s gave way to the 70s, Vietnam and the drug wars escalated the violence, and the neighborhood gangs evolved into criminal enterprises with political overtones. Nihilism seeped into society, but then a funny thing began to happen. As computers and cameras became more prevalent, and as the gang members matured and began to see some social progress, the sorts of crimes that were perpetrated became less violent and more technological: scams and frauds replaced strong arm robberies. Crackdowns on school violence removed the training grounds for accepted violence. Women's and children's rights to be safe from domestic abuse came to be recognized more, further reducing the training grounds for violence. The bar scenes began to be policed more often to reduce the violence there, and shifted towards dancing (sadly, not many seem to dance anymore).  As the veterans of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam grew older and fewer, the general acceptance of social violence fell throughout the 80s, 90s, and 00s as the country experienced greater peace and prosperity due to a greater degree of liberal influences on policies. Gangs became less common in the public sphere, but grew among the police cultures. Civil forfeiture replaced strong arm robberies as the most prevalent form of robbery. Crime tended to become atomized, individuals no longer needing an organization behind them to steal electronically.  Through it all. the shift from white male supremacist rule towards a more open society reduced crime and violence as more opportunities were shared, reducing the need for violent and nonviolent crimes to make personal progress. Conservatives felt threatened by this, because skin color, gender, religion, and sexual orientation no longer guaranteed a favorable position in society with little effort. They now have to compete for what they formerly were entitled to. For conservatives, the drop in actual crimes rates was akin to cleaning the kitchen: the cleaner the kitchen, the more obvious was the small areas of dirt that was missed as lower crime rates made what crimes were committed stand out all the more. And whenever the crime could be attributed to a minority, it proved to the conservative mind that ""those people"" weren't worthy of the privileges they were getting, privileges the conservatives viewed as taken from them.  Education and opportunity are the keys to reduced crime and violence. Unfortunately, the PTB decided in the 70s that the problems with society from their point of view were rooted in overeducated citizens, so they began reducing school hours and shrinking curriculums to remove critical thinking classes, civics classes, and economics classes in middle and high schools, with the results that we are currently living with: a mass of poorly educated and uncritical citizens more suited to be manipulable worker drones than self-governing citizens. But as the computer age has developed, self-education has become more common, and society is splitting into the poorly educated MAGA types and the better educated citizenry who support democracy and freedom from oligarchs.  The end result will be a transformation of the US into a declining oligarchic dictatorship, a progressive overthrow of the billionaire class, or a breakup of the nation. The two views...progressive vs conservative...are irreconcilable at this point.",Tliish,2025-05-08T11:46:20,2
"A survey from 2022:  >**Republican voters are much more likely than Democratic voters to see violent crime as a key voting issue** this year. Roughly three-quarters of Republican and GOP-leaning registered voters (73%) say violent crime is very important to their vote, compared with around half of Democratic or Democratic-leaning registered voters (49%)...  >...Black voters are particularly likely to say violent crime is a very important midterm issue...  >Some 81% of Black registered voters say violent crime is very important to their midterm vote, compared with 65% of Hispanic and 56% of White voters...  >...**Differences by race are especially pronounced among Democratic registered voters. While 82% of Black Democratic voters say violent crime is very important to their vote this year, only a third of White Democratic voters say the same.**  >[https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say/](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/10/31/violent-crime-is-a-key-midterm-voting-issue-but-what-does-the-data-say/)  White conservatives are more likely to worry about crime than are whites to their left.  The progressives and those to their left are often more worried about the police than crime.  Black voters may have more reasons to be legitimately concerned with violent crime, as homicide rates in the US are disproportionately high among blacks and in lower income neighborhoods.  Many black Democratic voters are moderate to conservative.  White conservatives vote Republican, but many non-white conservatives are voting Democratic.  Progressive Democrats are disproportionately white.  On the right, there is fear of The Other that sees crime where it isn't.  On the left, there is opposition to the police as an institution that refuses to see crime where it is.  For some who have to live in it, there is their experience which is not reflective of the median voter, since crime is disproportionately distributed and not always accurately reflected in the data.  To be blunt, your question sounds rather white progressive suburban.  You don't live in a bad neighborhood, so you don't have to cope with crime.  Because you don't cope with it, the experience doesn't legitimately exist for anyone else and you focus instead on your political opponents rather than on the segment of the population that has good reason to worry.    Meanwhile, there are reasons to believe that some crime data is not accurate.  When community members believe that the police or justice system won't help them, many requests to law enforcement that could have been made won't be made.  When there is no report, then there is no crime.",I405CA,2025-05-07T05:59:46,3

"There's definitely a disconnect with people who vote.   this is one area where non voters do a lot better,  if you polled non voters, who never were victims of crime they would way more accurately tell you the crime rate that matched victimization studies.      one interesting thing, is that reported crimes did drop during the last 7 or 8 years, but victimization surveys shows an increase.  Things like how people in SF ""know"" to park with their trunks open and windows down, actually looks great on crime report data.     but also looks terrible in victimization surveys.      why file a police report if you believe sincerely there's a 1% or lower chance of any resolution?   you wouldn't. well that will lower crime stats.  but it doesn't actually lower crime rates.",discourse_friendly,2025-05-07T00:27:42,0
"Depends on the city. And I don’t think k you can totally trust the data.   New York was a hellhole in the 80’s and 90’s until Giuliani (R) was elected and cleaned it up. Anyone who was there at the time could attest to that, and you didn’t need graphs of violent crime rates to prove it.  Then it felt pretty safe through the 2000’s. Now? There’s certain areas that are still pretty safe, but there’s a lot of neighborhoods that are way sketchier than they used to be. The violent crime rates have been mostly flat, but people that have lived through both know there are worse areas now.",slayer_of_idiots,2025-05-07T00:18:35,-4

"This is also exacerbated by a for-profit media ecosystem that survives on clicks. There was a separate study a few years back that showed engagement on stories related to trans issues was like 80x higher in conservative news sources than center or left leaning ones, which incentivized the creation of more and more reaction articles to these stories.
