"TVLand and its followers are just trapped in an infinite loop of *""HEY HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE--""* when the things they want to tell us about keep getting narrower and narrower in scope, less and less pleasant to be around. It's been a total dumpster fire for the past 10 years and the dumpster has been glowing green for the past 6 months, the more they want to play their stupid games the less interest I have in playing along ***with*** them.  Glance at the *Popular* tab to confirm, these are the three big topics for mainstream-left these days:  Manufactured Trump Scandal #1: 'botched deportation' (meaning we're finally doing something about the border ***at all***, and it makes them furious.)  Manufactured Trump Scandal #2: 'botched communications' (meaning we're finally fighting the Houthis ***at all*** after Biden restrained our navy to just giving daily weather reports on incoming attacks each day - **and it makes the left furious.**)  Manufactured Trump Scandal #3: 'OVER 9000UMPTILLION ECONOMY DOLLARS HAVE GONE UP IN SMOKE TODAY' because the market is down, exactly the same as they did with Bush. When it's an up day they do not say 'OVER 9000 ADDED TO THE ECONOMY TODAY' they just play a bleeding heart violin for human traffickers on that day instead.  **And whenever we walk past them without giving a rat's ass, they pretend the entire problem is that they haven't nagged us enough.**",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T15:13:49,13
