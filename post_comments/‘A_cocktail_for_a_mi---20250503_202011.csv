"Nah. Remember Donald Trump is in the wrestling hall of fame. He doesn't understand much, but he understands kafabe.   If you look back through the decade + he's been fucking up our politics, he has repeatedly done this same schtick.   He'll take Putin's side, some time will go on, and he'll seem like he comes out swinging. He'll condemn Putin on one thing or another. But it never amounts to anything. He never takes any action.   It's all kafabe. If Trump really wanted to, he could very, very easily make life a living hell for Vlad. Sanctions, resuming aid to Ukraine. It would be applauded by many in the Republican party.   But he never does because it's always kafabe.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-03T20:32:42,6

"In almost every instance up to this event, I'd agree. Nor is what I said any sort of breakup.   But he's always expressed, affectionately, a trust and respect between them, never believed Putin wanted to hurt him, only the best -- grooming.   The administration gave Putin every chance possible for Russia to get away with terms it really should have been made to beg for.  Putin gave him 0. Contradicted every statement he made, broke every pause. Nada, nothing. Repeatedly spanked Trump in public.   Even for Trump, that's harsh from someone he trusted -- asked for so little too. 'Please just do 1 little thing for me'   One glance from Putin like this though:  https://euromaidanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-24-at-1.23.43-PM.png  The heart yearns",nerphurp,2025-05-03T20:41:36,2
