Muslims support Trump's plan of letting a Jewish country erase Gaza from the earth? I call bullshit,IpeeEhh_Phanatic,2025-05-05T22:12:54,41
"The title doesn't match the article. According to the article, about 1/3 of Muslim-Americans identify each as Democrat, Republican, and Independent. A majority view the Dems favorably. Only 26% of Muslim-Americans support Trump's plan for Gaza.  The New York Post is a rag.",Fool_On_the_Hill_9,2025-05-05T23:52:54,10

It’s really impressive how the non-WSJ parts of the Murdoch press have somehow gotten even more slobbery than they were during the first term.,ScotTheDuck,2025-05-05T22:41:11,10
Again... the NY Post... 🤦‍♂️,williamgman,2025-05-06T00:50:02,3
"Here's a line from the propaganda... I mean story...  ""a plurality – \*of Muslims – (49%) opposed President Trump’s plan to transform the Gaza Strip into the “Riviera of the Middle East,” with 26% saying they supported the idea and 16% not giving an opinion one way or another.""  How that sways them away from the Democratic Party is never explained. Either way, I guarantee you any Muslim who voted for Trump is regretting it now.",OCDDAVID777,2025-05-06T02:04:06,3

Muslims backing the GOP. I don't think so. Nice try *Post*.,invalidpassword,2025-05-06T01:09:10,1

"Muslims are some of the most regressive people in the world in regards to social issues, remember that muslim town in Michigan that literally made pride flags illegal, they are not our allies and this shouldn't surprise anyone. It always put a bad taste in my mouth when dems would court them and call any criticism of them as bigotry",Jsmooth123456,2025-05-06T04:52:42,0
"Once I saw Muslim leaders encourage a boycott of Genocide Joe, I vowed never to listen to a single word of complaint from them about Trump's support of Israel.  They got their wish, Trump won, now they need to live with their decisions.",Virtual-Squirrel-725,2025-05-06T03:46:43,0

"I refuse to open NYPost link, so is it arguing Muslims support Trump's Gaza plan or Democrats support it?",bootlegvader,2025-05-05T22:46:44,7
Yet this does go to show we have no access to actual facts on this very important topic.   I agree that it sounds very weird to suggest that a plurality of Muslim Americans support Israel's plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza of Muslims.  But it's also frustrating that there's no straightforward way that we can find out what the actual facts are here.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T22:17:30,7
"Honestly, maybe, if they think it means fewer lives lost and the remaining Gazans are moved to better places to live. They might see it as at least an end to the violence and are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt just because they buy into him.",Scarlettail,2025-05-05T22:45:23,-2

"That’s where you’re mistaken. Yes trump loves israel(so do 99% of politicians, or at least they pretend to) but maga wants nothing to do with funding Israel ",luckyluchianooo,2025-05-05T22:12:51,-22
> maga wants nothing to do with funding Israel  Jesus Christ.  At least put some effort into your nonsense.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-approves-3-billion-arms-sale-israel/,mysticrhythms,2025-05-05T22:20:12,18
"You're fooling your self.  Far right AIPAC and the far right Evangelicals are both strong supporters of Israel, and both want to Palestinians out of Israel - alive or dead.  If Israel asks for money or weapons, Trump will give it to them.  He's been nothing but supportive of the genocide in Gaza.  Trump is also very keen on attacking Iran, the biggest military supporter of Hamas, Hezbollah and Gaza, for the benefit of Israel.    The Evangelicals even want to destroy the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount so that the Third Temple can be built there (it's part of their prophecies)  How do you think that will go down?",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-05T22:24:17,12
I literally said trump loves Israel as does every major politician. Maga as a whole does not,luckyluchianooo,2025-05-05T23:01:42,-7
Lol aipac (literally has Israel in its name) and religious boomers are your evidence?,luckyluchianooo,2025-05-05T23:03:57,-6
"You don't seem to understand what I'm saying.  AIPAC pumps massive dollars into the US political system and they get what the want.  Their money is used to elect Democrats and Republicans who don't criticize Israel, and to prevent candidates who are critical of Israel from ever getting elected.  They're big fans of Bibi and big fans of Trump, who you note doesn't criticize Israel or anything they do, including what you, and many others, call ""genocide"".  Evangelicals are Trump's most loyal supporters and make up the largest part of his base of voters.  There's 90-100 million Evangelicals in the US and 70% support Trump.  Trump got 77 million votes.  All of those wealthy Evangelicals preachers praying around Trump in the white house?  Paula White in the White House?  His Evangelical support dwarfs every other subgroup.  He does what they want.  I don't see any Muslim's in Trumps circle, or in his Party for that matter.  Why would Trump go against AIPAC and the Evangelicals?  He won't criticize Israel.  He, and his party will give money and weapons to Israel when they ask and he won't say anything about how they use them.  The recent April 25th vote to send $8.8 billion to Israel was passed with 100% Republican support - as every vote to send military aid to Israel gets from Republicans -  and 15 Democrats voted against it.  [https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/senate-democrats-cancel-military-aid-israel](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/03/senate-democrats-cancel-military-aid-israel)  Between the Evangelicals and AIPIC, Republicans are 100% in support of Israel doing anything they want to do.  Hell, Trump is trying to deport anyone who is even speaks out against the ""genocide"" and to prevent anyone from boycotting Israel.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-05T23:25:02,6
