"It‚Äôs was $3.59 today, down from $3.69 two weeks ago. I live in a red county in a red state that still has election signs up. Surprisingly all the ‚ÄúTrump low prices Kamala high prices‚Äù signs have disappeared.",Johnqpublic25,2025-05-06T18:15:15,12
"Turns out his Court Jesters were feeding him the price of gas BEFORE it was delivered to the point of sale.  That's no excuse.  He is unable to fact-check something himself due to his lack of comprehension of the written word.  He believes everything he says.  I cannot think of a statement of his which coincided with fact. I'm sure there are plenty of examples, and I will appreciate you bringing  it to my attention.",Aggravating-Blood383,2025-05-07T18:53:51,2
