"If theyâ€™re deported, why is the us spending $25,000 a year to support them?",grahmcrks,2025-04-18T21:00:36,164

"My objection on all of this is not that he was even deported itâ€™s that we are paying to keep him in an actual dungeon. Even if he did all of the things we are saying might be true and he was convicted here, the penalty would be less. He shouldâ€™ve just been hauled to immigration court and deported unless they were prepared to prove any of this.   At least this got everyone not talking about tariffs for a week so maybe thatâ€™ll cool and deals will get madeâ€¦  Edit: unclear if heâ€™s still in the dungeon.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-18T14:54:25,519
"Funny fact, the East Coast headquarters of the MS-13 gang, notorious for their participation in human trafficking, is based in Maryland. They have 2 locations they dominate in the US, Los Angeles, and Maryland.  But ya, this illegal El Salvador immigrant, who had an informant confirm he was an MS-13 member, was found clearly trafficking people in 2022, who had an order of protection put out on him for being a wife beater, by his wife, but ya, the Dems are hyping him up as father of the year lol. Let them keep doing it.",GeneticsGuy,2025-04-18T16:50:13,84
"The more that comes out about this guy, the more I wonder how this was the hill the media chose to die on. Was this the best they can do? If so, investigative journalism is dead.",tinkle_queen,2025-04-18T15:50:54,83

Liberal media cut away from President Trump when he started to describe the criminal activity of Garcia. No wonder the liberal sheep donâ€™t know the truth.Â ,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-18T14:21:45,62

Don't forget about beating his wife multiple times. For some reason the wife files a police report then takes him back.  I am sure that has nothing to do with him threatening her if she doesn't take him back,EverySingleMinute,2025-04-18T23:11:03,5

"The democrats narrative is always skewed but they are hoping you donâ€™t notice. They all have severe TDS, it is not healthy.  Kilmar Garcia is just fine and alive and should enjoy his stay in El Salvador. Hollandâ€™s visit was to give Holland publicity, he has no interest in Garcia except for the press it gives Holland.

"It's odd. On one hand they assure the criminals will stay locked up until death. On the other hand, we are paying for their indefinite incaceration",Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-04-19T04:52:40,40
"After, because of the media circus it has become.  Everything was established by an immigration court in 2019. The legal question is whether he should have been sent to El Salvador, given that he had a ""withholding of removal"" status due to a credible fear of retaliatory gang violence.  But El Salvador claims the gang in question has been broken up. So, what is it actually being argued at this point? If officials from both countries determine the gang threat is no longer an issue, does the administration then not have authority to deport?   I mean, Garcia had lunch with a US senator. So much for those ""death camps.""",Panzershrekt,2025-04-18T15:24:28,89

Why is it incumbent upon the Press Secretary to present all the evidence when it is public information?  News reporters did everyone an injustice by not doing a proper investigation themselves.,defnotarobit,2025-04-18T15:55:45,13

"Are we really suggesting that the American people should spend even more money and time on illegal immigrants than we already do?

"Yes, a big public court hearing for every single deported immigrant! 1 at a time too! Draw them out to be the biggest cases ever for tv, why not?!  The guy is not a citizen, and is an illegal migrant from el salvadore, with strong ms-13 ties, a criminal record, and the democrats full support.  Seriously?",thebp33,2025-04-18T14:57:50,-23
He had his time in front of two immigration judges. He isnâ€™t an American citizen who is given the SAME exact due process as one but he had his time already. Go back to r/politics â€˜fellowâ€™ conservative.,LiaAmity,2025-04-18T14:43:13,-34

"Liberals are far too deep into this now.  If he came out on national TV, showed off all his gang tats, admitted to various heinous crimes, punched a child and his 87 year old grandpa in the face, and kicked a golden retriever puppy to death...they'd still put their full support behind him.",Hank_Scorpio_ObGyn,2025-04-18T20:55:13,9

"""Due process"" means the process that is due. For an illegal immigrant, that doesn't mean court after court. It means that you have to prove that they're illegal (which they did) and then deport them to their home country. That's all the process an illegal is due.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-19T00:28:23,-9
What El Salvador chooses to do with their own citizens is none of our concern and isn't relevant to the withholding order.,LegitimateApricot4,2025-04-18T21:12:00,-31

"It's all relative and, unfortunately, the reality of this situation is quite troubling. The judges and workers who take action on these people on a day-to-day get desensitized to certain bad actions that show up time and time again. When you're comparing a ""bad"" person to people who have performed horrendous crimes, heinous, despicable actions, and the downright unthinkable....well, ""bad"" gets a backseat until all that pure evil is handled first. It's just mental triage, numbing....and it's a subconscious action.  Some of these people they are deporting and their back stories....good god....they were in our communities. What a real danger and sad state of affairs. Hell, it's not just the illegal immigrants either, there's plenty of our citizens who act in a manner that is unbecoming; however, due to the increasingly worse actions of others in the community, judges, CPS, and other social workers get desensitized. It's a sad reality, really.",Num_Pwam_Kitchen,2025-04-18T21:22:08,5

"It's not just that two judges said it. It's the evidentiary record as well. He was with people who were ms 13. He was wearing their uniform/colors.  He said he was at risk from a ""rival"" gang (de facto admission he's in a gang...). An informant also said he was in the gang. He was found with items like a massive amount of cash in his possession at the time and some other damning facts IIRC. Anyone can read the court record to see for themselves how the judges came to their conclusion and that it was in fact the correct one. This is on top of him later being found in the middle of what is thought to be trafficking 7 people.",day25,2025-04-18T23:29:32,18
