🎶CANT FIND THE FETTER-MAN🎵  Unfit for office. Fetterman is such a disappointment.,amanam0ngb0ts,2025-04-24T12:42:42,20
"I know a lot of people think this was some strategic gotcha Fetterman pulled after running as a progressive, like him angling to be the next Manchin.   But I honestly think the stroke just fucked his brain. I know he always kind of sucked but I think he's just fucked in the head at this point.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-24T12:49:50,18
"lmao no thanks.   No wars. Trump can't even handle a trade war, what makes you think he can handle an actual war. He's literally managing a war that we are not in online.",wizgset27,2025-04-24T12:32:08,9

"https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-bidens-washington/youre-gonna-have-a-fucking-war-mark-milleys-fight-to-stop-trump-from-striking-iran    >A running concern for Milley was the prospect of Trump pushing the nation into a military conflict with Iran. He saw this as a real threat, in part because of a meeting with the President in the early months of 2020, at which one of Trump’s advisers raised the prospect of taking military action to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons if Trump were to lose the election. At another meeting, at which Trump was not present, some of the President’s foreign-policy advisers again pushed military action against Iran. Milley later said that, when he asked why they were so intent on attacking Iran, Vice-President Mike Pence replied, “Because they are evil.”  Fetterman quotes from the posted article,  > ""Waste that s—t. You're never going to be able to negotiate with that kind of regime that has been destabilizing the region for decades already, and now we have an incredible window, I believe, to do that, to strike and destroy Iran's nuclear facilities."" >  > ""And remember, all of these so-called experts were all wrong. You know, they've been saying for years and years Hezbollah was the ultimate badass that kept Israel in check, and we can't move on anything beyond that."" >  > As it turned out, Fetterman said, the Iranian proxy group ""couldn't fight for s—t. And Hamas, literally, are just a bunch of tunnel rats with junkie rockets in the back of a Toyota truck. And now the Houthis have been effectively neutered as well. So what's left? You have Iran, and they have a nuclear facility, and it's clearly only for weapons."" >  > ""Years ago, I completely understood why Trump withdrew from the Obama deal. Today, I can't understand why Trump would negotiate with this diseased regime. The negotiations should be comprised of 30,000-pound bombs and the IDF,"" >  > ""It's not going to turn into World War III,"" Fetterman said, dismissing the worries. ""It's the acknowledgment that we'll never have a better opportunity."" >",tech57,2025-04-24T12:57:31,3

so hes saying we should start a nuclear war?,saiyanscaris,2025-04-24T17:17:50,1
"I've been saying I think the stroke has something to do with it too. He used to be super pro-LGBTQ, pro-marijuana legalization which are very progressive for a Lt. Governor in Pennsylvania! Maybe he still is some of those things but those aren't the issues he's standing up for anymore.   He was always kind of a troll (e.g. hanging those LGBTQ / cannabis flags from his office balcony at the capital) which I'm not a fan of even when it was ""for our side"", but he was genuinely funny at times whereas now he just seems more like a bully.",aspirationless_photo,2025-04-24T13:20:13,5

"War with Iran would not be like war with Iraq. We the US couldn't ""win"" in that kind of sense. At best we could just bomb the shit out of them, but a ground invasion, actually trying to hold/change the country... is not going to happen. Plus Iran is very cozy to russia, and we all know trump isn't going to do anything to really anger putin.   If somehow russia is okay with fucking over Iran... Iran can really fuck up the global economy. Roughly 20% of oil consumed is transported through the Strait of Hormuz.   War with Iran would would be worse than Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc etc combined.",joat2,2025-04-24T13:26:10,2
