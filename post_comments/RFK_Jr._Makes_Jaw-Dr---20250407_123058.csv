">“When I was a kid,” he told Victoria, “two million people got [measles] every year…and only 300 died.”  First, I highly doubt the numbers he used (I don't feel like fact checking it).  Second, what a callous fuckhead!  No wonder he globbed onto Trump.",Pretty_Boy_Bagel,2025-04-07T14:42:38,4

"It's like Page Six, but for politics  *Victoria and Bobby Jr. used to run in the same New York City circles. Back in the day, her filmmaker father,* ***Richard Leacock****, made two movies with* ***RFK****–Crisis and Hickory Hill.*  *A very large man running security on the Kennedy scion let her approach. After reconnecting with her old acquaintance, Victoria decided a word of warning might be useful for her fellow stranded passenger at Gate 8.*  *“Be careful handling the measles outbreak,” she cautioned.*   *Probably tired of batting away the chicken goujons at Mar-a-Lago, America’s health chief forgot all the glossy spin that got him through the confirmation process and shrugged. A Kennedy shrug..*   *“When I was a kid,” he told Victoria, “two million people got \[measles\] every year…and only 300 died.”*   *Only!*  *And then he was off, finally, to his emergency exit row seat on the late, late flight to make his choice between Popchips, Classic Grahams or a Chewy Chocolate Granola Bar. No prizes for guessing his choice.*",JeremyAndrewErwin,2025-04-07T13:15:21,5

There's a maddening number of people who will do anything that 47 and his acolytes say. And now I'm worried people will legit go get measles on purpose and spread it around because this is what their brain worm of the day told them to do.,KindlyKangaroo,2025-04-07T13:22:54,13
