Of course Amazon got weak and said they aren’t going to do it now. Fucking billionaires.,willywalloo,2025-04-29T11:00:52,25
Bezos folded like a wet paper bag before the cock of the orange traitor.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-29T11:02:30,16
Fuck Bezos.  Fuck Amazon.   They have bowed to the fascist.,No_Size9475,2025-04-29T11:03:48,14
"Cowards. What is the point of having all that money, wealth, and influence if you can't even defend your own integrity.  Judas sold out Jesus for just a handful of silver. I'd like to think if he'd known the man and also had some wealth, he would have held out a little longer than Amazon just did.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-29T11:05:26,8
"I'm waiting for Amazon to fire the team who had the idea in the first place. We live in Trump's America now, transparency is not welcome here.",woakula,2025-04-29T11:03:29,6
"So, now we'll just see really high prices without knowing how much of the increase was the result of tariffs?  Seems a shame, no?",dremonearm,2025-04-29T11:06:16,4
Why shouldn’t we have visibility into that information? wtf Amazon,Purple-Mulberry7468,2025-04-29T11:09:31,6
I actually thought Jeff Bezos might redeem himself here.    Silly me.,allenahansen,2025-04-29T11:04:59,4
"Very surprised by these comments accusing Amazon of ""folding"". MAGA is a small percentage of their customer base. Bezos doesn't ""need"" Trump like Republican politicians do.",rainshowers_5_peace,2025-04-29T11:30:28,2
"Amazon and Bezos protecting their government contracts over common sense.  Have hesitated dropping Prime for a while now,   …I think it’s time.",5minArgument,2025-04-29T11:47:10,2
Ran into this with an alibaba order.  $70 PSU would have had a $108 customs charge.,GravtheGeek,2025-04-29T11:48:43,2
I guess the admin hasn’t consolidated enough power and Amazon jumped the gun,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-29T11:02:51,1
"“Leavitt's response could signal an emerging rift between Trump and Bezos, who has joined other billionaires and tech leaders in cozying up to the Republican president since he won the 2024 election.”  Doubt it!",ahdidi413,2025-04-29T11:11:09,1
And with that... Bezos retracted his plans and slithered back into his castle to lay on a pile of money.,williamgman,2025-04-29T11:12:35,1
I am so over this clown administration,SGD316,2025-04-29T11:23:19,1
And here I was about to opt for Amazon over Target. Oh well. Guess there's really no good options outside of trying to buy local.,supes1,2025-04-29T11:26:55,1
Hopefully it’s the end of Amazon,KingTutt91,2025-04-29T11:05:54,1
"Well, it's time to stop buying from amazon.",Glittering-Matter960,2025-04-29T11:16:35,1
Bezos has stated publicly that no company remains unchanged. We started out as book sellers. The market changes.,OpenAlternative8049,2025-04-29T11:10:04,-1
I think for the average person when their cart is up 100-200% they'll know why.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-29T11:05:13,10
"Eh, the cats out of the bag. Those of us who can read will know prices will be going up because of Tariffs and the administration doesn’t want you to know that. Those who can’t will feel it in their pockets all the same.",JellyBellyShelly27,2025-04-29T11:56:54,2
Why do you think they got weak? They don't need Trump. MAGA is a small percentage of their customer base.,rainshowers_5_peace,2025-04-29T11:29:19,1
"On second thought, now bigger sellers on Amazon can price gouge. How naive I am.",Purple-Mulberry7468,2025-04-29T11:10:37,4
Trump has proven he can manipulate their wealth almost at will. He owns these guys now.,ahdidi413,2025-04-29T11:14:23,6
>I actually thought Jeff Bezos might redeem himself here.  Lmao why?,FantasticJacket7,2025-04-29T11:15:23,4
"I almost fell for it too...  I read that story and was like, ok maybe I can be an Amazon customer again.  Then the rug was pulled, lol.",Wendykroy666,2025-04-29T14:55:21,2
bruh....people here on reddit are still using Amazon despite Bezos bending the knee for Trump.   I think Amazon will be just fine,kinshoBanhammer,2025-04-29T11:36:24,3
Getting folks to stop using Amazon is harder than getting those 90 million who did not vote to finally vote. Maybe the tariffs will work for both those goals?,williamgman,2025-04-29T11:15:14,2
"Eh I dunno, the stupid is strong and these people seem to fundamentally not understand cause and effect. ",sylbug,2025-04-29T11:17:41,9
My Amazon cart is 100% down because I’ve deleted them and I’m never spending another penny with those fascist cock-suckers again.,Electric_Conga,2025-04-29T11:31:13,6
But maga will blame Marxists for being capitalist somehow,dumdumpoopie,2025-04-29T11:55:57,1
Foolish optimism?,allenahansen,2025-04-29T16:47:54,1
One can only hope,KingTutt91,2025-04-29T11:36:40,1
If you asked a conservative if they wanted to pay more in taxes they’d scream no.  The same people were screaming for tariffs.  ,Squirrely__Dan,2025-04-29T11:31:48,3
