So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.""  That's a quote from an American bishop, Robert Barron, from [this story](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-pope-could-it-be-american-cardinal-robert-prevost/) that came out when Prevost had emerged as a candidate from Pope.
