"The numbers for Social Security having any trouble what-so-ever don't add up for me.  Average amount paid in over lifetime with retirement at age 65 is $367,000.  Average amount paid out is $383,000 for lifetime benefits.  Assuming someone works from age 18 to 65, that average monthly contribution would be over $650  The Social Security fund is invested in treasury bonds with an interest rate of 4.25%  Through the miracle of compound interest, that $650 monthly should be **well over a million dollars in value after 47 years**.  I know this is rough since people tend to earn more as they get older, etc...but it's difficult to believe there is any real problem in funding, especially considering that both Gen Y and Z are now individually larger than the remaining Boomer generation...and Gen X is still gong to be working for some time.",GG1817,2025-04-01T12:00:30,61
Billionaires want it to be their money.  Social Security has been like the goose that lays the golden egg for a while now.  It's a ton of money there for the taking.,Explodistan,2025-04-01T12:04:37,34

"And they use the double-speak of ""entitlements"".  When did this word transmogrify to become its own antonym?   If I am employed and part of my pay package is the promise that I will get a pension, do I not deserve that pension when I retire? Am I not ""entitled"" to it? They use the word as if it's a handout.   1984 is here, it's now.",joetaxpayer,2025-04-01T14:10:22,10
Trumps government is for the vocal (slim?) majority. It is not for all Americans.  It supports enough people who have enough money and power to keep him in power.  This is how the occasional citizen being detained by ICE or deporting someone who had special protections is allowed to occur without severe penalties.

" Social Security does need to be fixed, we keep kicking the can down the road, but something needs to change to fix it.  2035, when the program could be depleted, seems an impossibly long time from now, but 99% of people here probably won’t be retirement age by then.",phxees,2025-04-01T18:27:29,1
"If they’d raise the ceiling as to when paying SSA tax on salaries stops, then we’d be more than sustainable. Right now it cuts off at $176,000.",ladymorgahnna,2025-04-02T02:28:27,1
"People don't want to hear this, but the painful reality is that social security IS structured like a classic ponzi/pyramid scheme, - currently retired SS recipients are being funded by working adults, and the current working-aged folks will get their SS payments from the next generation. It's an awful setup, especially given that people are having way fewer kids so less people are currently working to cover the costs of the much larger retired boomer population. And this is a trend that will only get worse over time as 5-child families give way to 1-2 child families.  I am 100% in favor of SS and keeping it viable, just pointing out that technically it IS structured like a pyramid scheme and that is a big reason for its alleged budget woes.",beenyweenies,2025-04-02T14:11:04,1

My mother in law died just before retirement so she never collected one penny from all of her contribution. Divorced too so no survivor benefits.,Ambitious_Cat713,2025-04-01T13:16:35,34
"There will be a short fall in 2033. Less money will be coming in than going out. At that point, if Congress doesn't act, they'll chop 20% per month off from your check. But it's not a ponzi scheme. It's a pay as you go system. The main issue for the shortfall is declining populations paying into the trust fund. But, it can be fixed.",baby_budda,2025-04-01T13:28:27,11
"Idk about your math bro, but $650 from a paycheck at 18 is the whole thing.    You have to compound based on the low initial values, not just the total average because otherwise you end with inflated numbers. That's not including that the return rates are for any given period. That's said, plenty of variables can affect the total.    I'm sure the math has already been run before at some point with stuff like that factored in.",Hillbilly_Boozer,2025-04-01T12:32:38,2

"And...not really buying it. A lot of that ""money going out"" is in the form of compounding interest on federal treasury bonds...  Are they saying they don't want to pay out on the money owed? Would they tell that to any other investor that had bought US bonds when they matured?   Conceptually, I think they have it wrong...even if we don't bring something like MMT into it - at which point the fake problems become farcical.",GG1817,2025-04-01T14:15:17,2

"I covered your point at the end of my post. Yes, the numbers might be reduced down to closer to a million dollars, or maybe even a bit under...but so what? If we're talking about anywhere in that neighborhood, then the $383,000 lifetime average payout is still trivial.",GG1817,2025-04-01T14:22:42,2
