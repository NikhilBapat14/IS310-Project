"The government is raising taxes colossally at the same time they're cutting services. And some people still think it's ""fiscally conservative"" to cut services.   ""We'll collect so much money from these tariffs"" is coming from a lot of people who are going to find out they're not part of that ""we.""",pervocracy,2025-05-06T09:13:21,8

I don't know about empty shelves at Walmart or Target yet but I do know that some of the online retailers that I visit are not replacing items that have been sold out because the tariffs would make the prices too high.,jarchack,2025-05-06T09:28:41,4
"*Bloomberg News reporters Andre Tartar, Denise Lu, Raeedah Wahid, and Aaron Gordon:*  On April 24, against the backdrop of towering cranes, dockworkers at the Port of Long Beach began unloading the OOCL Violet, a hulking shipping vessel carrying thousands of containers full of goods bound for the US. The Violet is one of the first ships confronting a harsh, new reality: a steep [145% tariff rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-10/trump-tariffs-on-china-now-at-least-145-as-trade-war-ramps-up) on nearly half of its Chinese cargo, brought on by President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war with China.  The ship had already begun loading goods bound for the US prior to Trump’s [April 2 tariff announcement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/trump-says-he-s-signing-executive-order-on-reciprocal-tariffs). When the ship reached California, it carried cargo with a total estimated value of at least $564 million, according to detailed bills of lading data from IHS Markit. About 40% of the goods were likely subject to the new 145% rate, according to Bloomberg News estimates. The data suggests importing companies face at least $417 million in new tariffs for all goods on the ship. That’s on top of preexisting import fees.",bloomberg,2025-05-06T08:59:20,4
All that tariff money... going from consumers wallets... Directly to the Trump administration's pockets. Greatest grift ever. Yet MAGA calls it a Patriot Tax.,williamgman,2025-05-06T09:29:57,3

And now they are telling us we need to make sacrifices for the world’s dumbest trade war, which is being prosecuted with no coherent strategy and for no coherent reason other than one man’s ego.   These people are so fucking out of touch.",Johnny_Appleweed,2025-05-06T11:07:44,2
You could say that about any tax. It comes out of your pocket and goes to the government.    Except in this case it's not going to pay for newer better government services because Trump is cutting everything massively. It's just going to cut the taxes on the wealthy.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-06T11:34:52,5
