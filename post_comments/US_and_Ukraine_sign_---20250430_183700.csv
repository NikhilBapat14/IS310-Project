If or when this is all over and Ukraine survives as a sovereign nation then I would hope that it extracts itself from this deal made at the point of a gun.  Nationalisation or renegotiation would be the only equitable outcome for Ukraine. Trump however appears to make this deal on the proviso that Ukraine cedes territory already occupied by Russia.  The US will not risk putting boots on the ground in Ukraine and the pushing of Russia back into its historical borders will be too costly.  All round fuckery by the US and Russia leaves Ukraine in a rotten position.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-30T21:20:02,3

">While it did not specify security support that Washington would be willing to provide in return, it stated that the deal was ""a tangible demonstration of the United States of America's support for Ukraine's security"".  BS. This isn't a ""tangible demonstration"" if there are no security guarantees.  It makes me so angry that trump cares more about making economic deals with Ukraine than about protecting Ukrainians from getting killed and protecting them from russia stealing their land. Ukraine is being invaded and civilians are constantly being killed, and instead of doing something about that, trump's first priority is to get access to Ukraine's minerals!",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T19:13:18,1

Why are democrats/lefties/progressives so simple? Read between the lines: this is a implienct security garentee. The worst thing Trump could have done was officially announce the security garentees. Thst would just antagonise Putin and Russia.,RepresentativeYak864,2025-04-30T19:14:24,-7

"Surprisingly, for the details that have emerged, it seems neutral.  For one, the fund starts at zero for both sides on day one.   The US can contribute to the fund by giving weapons and/or military assistance to Ukraine.     https://kyivindependent.com/breaking-ukraine-us-sign-minerals-deal/  The deal will not allow any ""state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine"" to profit from Ukraine's reconstruction, Bessent said.    Shortly before the deal was signed, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced the Ukrainian government had approved the agreement.  ""Thanks to this agreement, we will be able to attract significant resources for reconstruction, start economic growth, and receive the latest technologies from partners and a strategic investor in the United States,"" Shmyhal said.  The ""Reconstruction Investment Fund"" will be jointly managed by Kyiv and Washington in an equal partnership, with both sides contributing to the fund. According to Shmyhal, future military aid from the U.S. can count as contributions to the fund, but prior assistance is not included.  **""The agreement does not provide for any debt obligations,""** Shmyhal said.  Ukraine will retain ""full control over subsoil, infrastructure, and natural resources,"" the prime minister said. The establishment of the fund will also not interfere with Ukraine's path to membership in the European Union.  Svyrydenko confirmed these stipulations in a post on social media, adding that Ukraine's state-owned businesses such as Energoatom and Ukrnafta would retain state ownership and that the agreement abides by Ukraine's Constitution.  The fund will exclusively be supplied with revenues from newly issued licenses, Svyrydenko said.

Interesting provision where any state who financed Russia war machine will not be allowed.   This essentially boxes out the EU as they were and still are major buyers of Russian energy.

"Why aren't the human lives being lost in Ukraine valuable enough to protect, without a mineral deal? Are you saying America is willing to go to war with russia over minerals, but not human lives?  And if we're ***not*** willing to go to war with russia, what's the point of the mineral deal? russia can simply attack all the places Ukraine has minerals, and the US will do nothing to fight back.  My point is that this deal doesn't make any sense. Ukraine needs a deal with an actual security guarantee written into the deal, not some BS about minerals.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T19:40:02,2
Trump and company support Russia. They either support them ideologically and or want to do business with them. Trump has wanted to slap his name on a building in Moscow since the 80s.   This deal won't change any of that.,WriteThatDownQuick,2025-04-30T19:15:06,2

US already had investments in Ukraine when they invaded this time. Literally nothing has changed from the last time they invaded with this. The idea that it's a security guarantee is absurd.,Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-30T23:03:04,1
Russia isn't all that. Poland could take Russia. Russia's training and equipment is rather poor. They got nukes bit even then why maintain a lot of costly nukes. I bet they have enough to demonstrate nuclear ability.,Plzbanmebrony,2025-04-30T19:31:07,1
"If that's true, then how come on day one of trump being president, he didn't send American troops all over Ukraine, including in Ukrainian territory occupied by russia? The US troops could just tell russia to leave. This would make Ukraine regain all territory and protect it from being attacked. After all, you just said that russia wouldn't attack Americans. So this would work.  If that's NOT true -- meaning russia IS willing to attack Americans -- then this mineral deal is useless, because russia could just attack all the places with Ukraine's minerals, and America won't do anything to fight back. We'll just do nothing and let russia attack, I guess. We won't protect our assets. Or maybe we will protect them? We'd go to war with russia over minerals, but not over Ukrainian lives?  The point is, this deal makes no sense. It makes no sense to make an economic deal with Ukraine during a time it's under attack and having its territory stolen. Keeping Ukraine safe from invasion should be the first priority, THEN economic deals would make sense.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T19:33:07,0
