"Cook Islands are not recognized as a member state of the United Nations either, so not sure what you are referring to here specifically.  They have more representation in international organisations because the Cook Islands are in what is styled a 'free association' with New Zealand, which recognises full political independence of the islands (as well as Niue). Greenland has been granted home rule but its foreign policy and security policy are the constitutional responsibility of Denmark.  Greenland's status is not unusual in global politics; you can look at other 'constituent countries' like Cura√ßao (represented by France in the UN) which are self-governing but are not full members of the United Nations.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-01-03T15:31:44,2
