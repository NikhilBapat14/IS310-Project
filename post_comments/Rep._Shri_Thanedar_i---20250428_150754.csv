"The more the left uses lawfare against President Trump, the stronger he becomes. It’s his superpower. ",Long_Jelly_9557,2025-04-28T15:15:04,191
"""Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he is unfit to serve as President and represents a clear and present danger to our nation’s constitution and our democracy,""  Oh, like the Biden administration arresting people for going to church during COVID shutdowns? What's the point in the separation of church and state if it's just going to be violated by democrats?  Democracy? Like how Kamala was selected to be the primary? ok...  People's rights were violated throughout the entire 4 years Biden was in office.  Millions upon millions of illegal immigrants were let into the country by airplane and buses.  People got sued because they didn't want to serve someone, but then democrats refuse services to Christians, and nobody bats an eye.  Judges and lawyers got on camera threatening Trump and anyone that supports him with violence. They told people to ""take to the streets"". They shot at Trump, cursed at him, and tried to blow him up.  They gave death threats to Elon Musk and burned down Tesla factories and business locations. They damaged private property.  They gaslit and lied to the entire nation for 4 years about the economy and Biden's mental state/abilities.  Tell me more about violations of the Constitution and threatening democracy...  These are just tidbits of examples of how far off the rocker democrats are.",caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-28T15:31:30,238

2003 was the one I played.  I remember it and MVP Baseball 2003 both having Handful of Redemption by Boy Sets Fire as part of their soundtracks which surprised me when I played one and then played the other later.  I also played a lot of the version on Nintendo DS and I played a ton of it.  I actually got really good at the putting on it too because the grid made sense and the readings made sense.  It would just tell you like 2 feet left and one foot short for instance and each square on the grid was X number of feet though I've forgotten at this point how much exactly so you'd just put estimate the number of squares to aim with.,ponmbr,2025-04-28T20:14:10,1
