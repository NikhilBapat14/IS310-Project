"For anyone curious.  Not in this article, but a 5min google dive.   He was a domestic abuser, or rather charged of. Against his now estranged wife, and two sons. One of which called the police, and either the same one, or the other tried to step in between the two parents. This appears to be what he was out on a $5,000 unsecured bail(so he didn't have to pay a dime). Appears to have been a mechanic, the now unemployed, and was an Army reservist for 8 years(honorable/dishonorable, other than discharge unknown). Was over $100k in debt, and it seems on assorted pills for ""mental health"" reasons. Which included attempted suicide after/during(?) the DV incident. He claimed that while taking medication, the pills caused behavior changes.(kinda the point last I checked)  Political leanings, per one paragraph I found seem to be, just anti... everything. Anti Trump, and apparently Anti Biden.   TLDR; Per what is out now, seems like someone who was just broken.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-15T15:39:31,2
