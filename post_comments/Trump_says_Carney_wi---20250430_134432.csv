"That’s Carney’s cue to not visit for three or four weeks at least. What does Trump imagine we elected Carney for? I want someone to tell Trump right to his face to fuck himself with a brick, and Carney was my only shot. ",clickmagnet,2025-04-30T13:50:46,15
I would love Carney to show up at the White House wearing a casual military-style ensemble as a nod to Zelenskyy.,biscuitarse,2025-04-30T13:54:40,9
He also suggested that Carney hates him less than Poilievre. I highly fucking doubt that. Just because he is Canada‘s Phil Dumphy doesn’t mean he should take his kindness for weakness.  Edt for my dumbass error.,ReallySam88,2025-04-30T13:59:09,3
Carney should send Trudeau as his representative.,PicoRascar,2025-04-30T14:04:03,3
As an American I hope Carney tells Trump to pound sand,da_man4444,2025-04-30T14:04:22,3

"Dude, I wouldn’t cross or go near any US border right now, even if I was the emperor of the universe. The mix of incompetence and evil with first hand accounts of terrorist behavior from ICE, and snatching people off the street and them just disappearing.   It doesn’t even have to be a border. There was a family (US citizens, though that doesn’t make any difference to me) that was forced out of their house and the teenage daughters were made to stand outside in the rain in their underwear. They took all of their computers, phones and money. Even when ICE/US Marshals/FBI found out they were American citizens they told them they might not be able to get back their stuff back for months.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-30T14:21:37,2
"imo he's already starting with the compliments because he needs to ""make a deal"" that allows him to cancel his trade war with canada while looking like a win on his part because he's losing to china on the that trade war and can't afford to keep this up would be my guess. He's extremely two-faced when he actually needs something from someone, in this case undoing the canada trade war to keep the damage minimal from the one he started with china.",SPACE_ICE,2025-04-30T14:28:41,2
Trump is always quick to flatter anyone who he sees as a winner.,DisMFer,2025-04-30T14:05:38,1
Trump should visit Carney not the other way around.  Is Trump welcome in Canada?,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-30T14:08:00,1
Now I hope he doesn’t visit at all,shadowdra126,2025-04-30T13:55:44,1
"Yea that’s never gonna happen. We’re still allies and neighbors. Carney is still a politician, not a liberal activist ",luckyluchianooo,2025-04-30T14:22:27,1
"Hell, show up in a t-shirt and jeans, and he'll lose no respect from me. No one could bring the tenor of the White House lower than its current occupant. ",Simmery,2025-04-30T14:02:38,3
"No he said that the one who hates him the least was elected and the PP hates him more, he is doing that to throw off the similarities between him and PP, he has said it twice before the election. Does he think us Canadians never knew about reverse psychology lol",lighthouse1969,2025-04-30T16:57:41,1
"Absolutely not. >:(   Bro part of me wants Carney just to say ""skibidi toliet"" then just hang up and ignore trump indefinitely.  Information is paramount, but I don't know if there is anything to gleem off him or his team. Who knows maybe he gets something out of a meeting.",No_Method5989,2025-04-30T14:15:44,4
Felons aren't allowed entry to Canada.,lilacmuse1,2025-04-30T22:03:09,1
"Are we allies tho? I'm a dual citizen and I'm no longer so certain. If you expect Canada to behave as an ally, you cannot threaten their sovereignty",RelevantJackWhite,2025-04-30T14:32:59,6
"Neighbours, I grant you. I know it’ll have to be a figurative go-fuck-yourself. If it’s either that or Pierre rolling over hoping for a belly rub, I’ll take it. ",clickmagnet,2025-04-30T15:24:53,2
"Damn talk to text. I was watching the news when I wrote this but yes, you are correct. I am wrong.",ReallySam88,2025-04-30T17:44:44,1
