"""The Harvard Precedent"" will be how we tax the Mega Churches & Prosperity Creed Pastors until the pips squeak.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-05-05T18:40:39,10
"In a few weeks this will be overturned, about the same time we'll be dealing with supply chain issues and tariffying new realms of Trump economic policy.",localistand,2025-05-05T18:49:10,8
Because Harvard grads don't tend to fill jobs vacated by deported immigrants — undocumented or otherwise. The master plan doesn't work until a higher education becomes obsolete. Pretty soon foreign countries will be outsourcing to us.,invalidpassword,2025-05-05T18:48:40,4

Republicans: they’ll go to Harvard but then defund it to keep the population uneducated.,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-05T18:51:57,1
I think it’s hilarious that the The Fanta Führer administration is trying to pick a legal battle with the school that is known for law students.,KrookedDoesStuff,2025-05-05T20:41:52,1
I am big fan of taxing religion. Make them pay their share.,if_only_i_r_smart,2025-05-05T18:51:15,12
It's Harvard.  A very large chunk of the country's top lawyers came from there  I'm expecting by Wednesday.,ERedfieldh,2025-05-05T19:27:54,2

"Absolutely.  In any case, the churches are not politically neutral.  A ""Pastor"" in a $1,000,000 car is bullshit.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-05-05T19:00:57,9
"Make all parts of society pay their taxes. The churches use the courts, the roads, the planes, even the education system. Nothing should have absolute exemption. Get rid of non profits and make taxes on revenue at a much lower rate. No using your business to deduct expenses.",shwilliams4,2025-05-05T19:28:18,3
"Doesn't matter how good your lawyer is, the courts are slow moving, for better or worse.",PluginAlong,2025-05-05T20:22:16,0
But God told these pastors to save the poor people from their money,if_only_i_r_smart,2025-05-05T19:28:19,2
I sure churches would just use the same lies as the elite rich and say I don't have anything to tax,if_only_i_r_smart,2025-05-05T19:35:00,1
Hence why you do it on revenue. Don’t give up.,shwilliams4,2025-05-05T20:04:09,2
