"Yea. You're doing illegal shit. No, no, you don't have to stop doing illegal shit, you just have to report that you're maybe doing illegal shit. We totally know we can depend on you to be truthful in your reporting, because illegal shit is bad, and you'd never abuse any rules whatsoever in the undertaking of illegal shit you do.  Good plan.",JustStuff03,2025-05-03T15:56:03,57

">A group of Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation Thursday that would require the Trump administration to share reports on the steps they are taking to comply with court orders surrounding deportations to El Salvador.Â   >...  >It would also require an assessment of El Salvador's human rights record and require the Trump administration to confirm if U.S. funds are being used to support the detention of U.S. residents.  Good, I'm glad they're doing this. Put pressure on Republicans. Make them explain why they're going to vote against this bill and why they want the details of the US's contract with El Salvador to be a secret, and why they want El Salvador's human rights abuses to be a secret.",sachiprecious,2025-05-03T16:47:13,11

Next thing that you'll see the right-wing party of big holding companies and hedgefunds do is try to securitize these people so that they can disclose just the instrument associated with these groups of people instead of having to disclose their individual names and then they can unload their securitized people and do anything they want to with them.,postsshortcomments,2025-05-03T18:41:09,-1
"And itâ€™s only a start. We *know* about El Salvador, but thereâ€™s surely other places ICE is sending people. The Russian dissident and Arab Doctor are a few cases that come to mind. Theyâ€™re whisked away too with little to no warning or process. In the case of the Russian they are clearly at danger if deported",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-04T07:31:19,4
"I mean, it's a logical step after the Republican party blocked the attempt to stop the renditions entirely. Is it the best possible step? Obviously not.   Still rather they be doing -something- than nothing.",KingBanhammer,2025-05-03T19:13:15,13

Can there even be red tape on something that is possibly illegal?,FawningDeer37,2025-05-03T15:37:35,6
Red tape is time-consuming administrative burdens that often interfere with productive learning or achievement.,ConservapediaSays,2025-05-03T23:34:55,1
"If I understand the article correctly, they're trying to push this legislation under the US Foreign Aid Act, which established USAID, which consequently just got it's funding and operations recently gutted. I haven't read the intricacies of how they're trying to make this somewhat workable - but on the surface it seems like a superficial circle jerk to try and keep USAID funded by some means. Which is performative at best, but likely is gonna get laugh slapped down immediately.   When I get time to get more in depth reading, maybe I'll find a grain of hope. Right now, it feels like grasping for straws.",JustStuff03,2025-05-03T19:22:46,2
"It is illegal, no due process and violating court orders to cease is illegal.   No way this passes with Republicans, they have no interest in following the constitution.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-03T15:41:53,13
