I wonder how many of our expensive multi-million dollar drones got shot down because of these morons.,TintedApostle,2025-05-05T16:44:36,9
The software's from a non-American company. A country that's not part of the Five Eyes has read every message to and from Mike Waltz. He shouldn't be a part of anyone's presidential administration.,ZebraImaginary9412,2025-05-05T16:52:44,7
"This is my shocked face. The administration consistently making us less secure and spilling our secrets because they're toddlers. It's an off the shelf app that wraps Signal and copies messages to a third party repository.    Usually not a big deal with Fortune 500 companies or companies that have strict retention requirements. Not good for fucking classified material regardless if it were mirrored elsewhere.   In the past it was used to say, ""Hey, check your secure messages."" Now we have fucking idiots war planning.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-05T16:54:56,7
"The messaging app used by at least one top Trump administration official has suspended its services following reports of hackers stealing data from the app. Smarsh, TeleMessage’s parent company, says it is now investigating the incident.  “TeleMessage is investigating a potential security incident. Upon detection, we acted quickly to contain it and engaged an external cybersecurity firm to support our investigation,” a Smarsh spokesperson told WIRED in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, all TeleMessage services have been temporarily suspended. All other Smarsh products and services remain fully operational.  President Donald Trump's now-former national security adviser Mike Waltz was captured by a Reuters photographer last week using an unauthorized version of the secure communication app Signal—known as TeleMessage Signal or TM Signal—which allows users to archive their communications. Photos of Waltz using the app appear to show that he was communicating with other high-ranking officials, including Vice President JD Vance, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"It's important to note, this Signal clone didn't ""Get Hacked"".  It had hard coded credentials.   It's like saying some broke into your house, when the front door never had a lock, and further had a big welcome sign.",m0ngoos3,2025-05-05T18:48:40,2

"TeleMessage was founded in Israel in 1999 and was acquired last year by the US-based digital communications archiving company Smarsh.   He communicated with Vance, Rubio, Gabbard, and other top national security officials. Does this mean they were using it too?",amir_twist_of_fate,2025-05-06T07:33:19,2
