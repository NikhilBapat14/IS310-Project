In some ways he‚Äôs not wrong. Free nations will vote with Trump in mind if that country is hostile or friendly to Trump. If Canada is any indication it‚Äôs not going to be good for Trump. Hence Fox News keeping trumps cult shielded from world opinion on him and how much more advanced they are in other nations.   There will be some surprises on countries that will cower before the orange goon but I feel with the way things are going the free world will ditch the Trump/Maga run United States,Abbey_Something,2025-04-29T10:00:12,1
