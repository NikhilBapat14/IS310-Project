">Exactly when that parade would be held and what it might entail remains to be seen.  Trump has already said he wants it on June 14th, which is [his birthday](https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/07/politics/trump-plans-military-parade-washington/index.html).     >Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on Monday also confirmed that the city is having discussions with the administration about it, a day after the Washington City Paper reported on the plans for a military parade to be held on June 14. **That date is both the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US Army and President Donald Trump’s 79th birthday.**  There's the plausible deniability.   Of course Trump is going to crow about having a military parade on his birthday, because he can't help but admit that everything he does is about him, but Fox is going to spin this as ""it's the 250th anniversary of the US Army and liberals are trying to make Trump seem like a dictator because of the coincidence of it falling on his birthday"".",MadBlue,2025-04-07T19:34:06,1
