"Times Opinion columnist Lydia Polgreen says in a conversation with Patrick Healy, the deputy Opinion editor:  >Having spent most of my life living overseas and particularly living in poor countries, in Africa and in Asia, there’s such a mix of admiration, longing and resentment for the United States.  >That experience of dependency, of needing American aid or needing America’s assistance if you’re a NATO country, of kind of living in a global economy that’s dominated by the United States — that has been a source of just extraordinary resentment.  >What I think Donald Trump has done is actually given people permission around the world to give full voice to that anger and resentment at the United States that has always kind of bubbled below the surface.  America has been the “hail fellow well met” on the global stage for a very long time — people are happy to see us, but then also resent our self-satisfaction and our wealth and our military power, but then also depend on it.

"It took Hitler *10 years* before he was sending people to the gas chambers en masse. Even if you count Trump's first term, he's gunna need a bit more time...",brocht,2025-04-24T14:12:09,3
"> people are happy to see us, but then also resent our self-satisfaction and our wealth and our military power, but then also depend on it.  No, no, no Trump says we've all been playing America for suckers for decades by negotiating and signing deals that only favour us and also taking advantage of your overall largesse.   But you figured it out.   To think you could have been the wealthiest, most privileged country to ever exist if it wasn't for our dishonest, dastardly deeds over the last 80 years. Oh well.",biscuitarse,2025-04-24T14:19:21,2
