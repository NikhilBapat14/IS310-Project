"To all the skeptics:  - This debunked claim originated from a small study back in 1998 authored by the infamous Andrew Wakefield. The study was later found to be inherently flawed and fraudulent, and was not only retracted, but repudiated by the scientific community.  - Wakefield had his medical license revoked for serious professional misconduct and he's been ostracized by medical experts.  - Since then, many large scale, rigorous studies have established no link between vaccines and autism.   - Wakefield's study included only 12 children, and while it shouldn't have to be stated, this kind of sample size is unprecedentedly small—meaningless in fact—and far too small to draw any reliable conclusions from.  - Wakefield was also criticized for a lack of a control group in his study, which is an essential part of any meaningful experimental study.  - He also altered patients medical histories to support his claims, he had conflicts of interest and his study involved the unethical treatment of children.  - Dozens of large scale studies involving literally millions of children have since been conducted, all of them consistently pointing to the same conclusions—that vaccines do not cause autism.  - Thimerosal—a mercury based preservative previously  used more commonly in some vaccines—was also the target of anti-vax claims which have since been debunked.  - Extensive research has shown that there is no link between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, while research has also shown that even low doses of the preservative in vaccines do not cause any harm other than minor reactions like redness/swelling at the site of injection.  - And despite this research, Thimerosal was still removed from most childhood vaccines anyways as a precautionary measure. It is only really used in some flu vaccines today, and even then, you can request vaccines without it.  I feel compelled to add to this a short list of some of the dangerous and unfounded claims Kennedy has made over the years.   But first, I've heard a few people (outside of his fringe followers) argue that some of the criticisms levied against RFK Jr. are unwarranted or unfair because of his record as an environmental lawyer. In other cases, some people try to downplay his insanity, arguing that his words are taken out of context.  When it comes to the former, RFK Jr. has since lost all credibility due to the erratic, harmful and baseless claims he's made related to vaccines and public health  Not to mention his adherence to Trump and a MAGA agenda that is eroding the independence of public health related agencies, that's stripping knowledgeable civil servants of their protections, that's maligning medical professionals and propping up discredited ""health experts"" (quacks), all while his department is taking steps to dismantle agencies and organizations that are largely responsible for the day-to-day operations and broader objectives related to protecting the environment and maintaining public health and safety.  Id also be remiss if I didn't mention his founding of The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vax non profit that played a significant role in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of dozens of children.  I should also mention his recent trip to the Southwest, which is currently at the center of a historic measles outbreak, where he praised a ""healer"" who was administering alternative treatments to unvaccinated children and adults while infected with the measles no less.  Now when it comes to the argument that Kennedy really isn't as batshit as the media makes him out to be, here are just some recent examples of his ignorant and dangerous remarks:  > Kennedy said, 'I probably did say, Lyme disease is ""highly likely a militarily engineered bioweapon""'  > Kennedy has repeatedly suggested environmental toxins, including those in drinking water, are linked to gender identity in children. These claims are unfounded.  > He has reiterated a thoroughly debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism  > Kennedy has also referred to the Covid vaccine as “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” despite data showing it’s overwhelmingly safe.  > At an event last year, Kennedy promoted a racist and antisemitic theory that Covid “ethnically targeted” white and Black people but not Ashkenazi Jews or Chinese people.  > Kennedy has amplified baseless claims suggesting a link between antidepressants like Prozac and school shootings. “Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events,” he told billionaire Elon Musk last year. But research shows that most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications — and even when they were, there was no association between those drugs and the shootings.  > He has long peddled AIDS denialism conspiracy theories, alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and questioning the “theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS.”  > He lamented that “any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable — even dangerous — heresy among our reigning medical cartel and its media allies”   > Kennedy’s book frequently cites discredited work of Peter Duesberg, a prominent AIDS denialist. “I haven’t found any evidence that HIV ever actually kills a T-cell.”  > He argued vaccines make people “lose IQ” and said the vaccine “dominant narrative” has “little proof.”  > Kennedy claimed vaccinologists add toxins to vaccines to amplify immune response. “They literally went on a search throughout the world looking for the most toxic things that they could find in order to add them to the vaccine,”  > Kennedy claimed that nobody knows the risk for any currently scheduled vaccines and that “nobody can say with any scientific certainty that [the polio] vaccine is averting more injuries than death than it’s causing.”  > [He] claimed flu and polio vaccines increase susceptibility to future flu strains and polio cases.  > Kennedy has also claimed that ""there is zero evidence that the flu shot prevents any hospitalization or any deaths... The flu shot transmits the flu. In fact, if you get the flu shot, you're six times more likely to give somebody else the flu, than if you didn't get the flu shot.""  > ""Since we started mandating the flu shot for elderly people... Their life expectancy has dramatically gone down.""  > ...Speaking on “Health Freedom for Humanity,” a podcast run by a nonprofit advocating for medical freedom, Kennedy encouraged people to join him in telling strangers not to vaccinate their babies  > In July 2023, the same month he testified at the House hearing, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.”  > He also accused Fauci of destroying repurposed medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that also “would’ve obliterated Covid.”  Kennedy is an obvious kook who should have been disqualified from any position in government, let alone a position that oversees all public health related agencies.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-23T16:14:33,5

I notice how the breeze bends the blades of grass in repeating threes, or how the sun tastes different through a windowpane.  Eye contact feels like too much sky. So I look sideways, through the edges of things, where truths tend to hide and not ask questions.  Sometimes, I don’t speak because words are too slippery, and my feelings are too exact for letters to hold.  But give me time — and space that feels kind — and I’ll show you how beautiful the world is when it finally makes sense.",Beelzabub,2025-04-23T15:08:49,2

By modern definitions they are both Autistic. Old definitions Dan Ackroyd had Asperger's and my brother in law had Autism. Now it's all Autism. I understand the reasoning of why they made the change, but I think it worked out better before. Before I knew like 2 people with Autism, now I know like 90. And it's out of the same group of people. I don't think definitions should ever be fuzzy. Autism hasn't gone up in reality. Maybe some statistics might say so, but it's only because the definition has changed.

I always love how offended and upset bigots are when they find out that people they expect to share their bigotry don't. It's exactly what's happening in the Austin Metcalf story. It is upsetting to them that this father who would be otherwise a great example for them is refusing to let them use his son as an excuse for treating all Black people like criminals. They're so angry about it because it shames them. His courage and his refusal to allow the actions of one person to speak for a whole group of people like a decent person shows them for what opportunistic freaks they are.

And I can almost guarantee because of the fact that mental health in general, has begun to be more prevalent among the medical world. So no shit there are more people with autism, people are probably finally figuring out they have a mental disorder instead of just “being different from others” all along. It’s easy to say more people have autism when it’s also a genetic disorder, so it’s probably been heavily passed down through past generations using….well… things like cocaine and morphine as their forms of medication so, I have a feeling that may correlate to a higher mental illness rate in the modern age 😬",madsmcgivern511,2025-04-23T22:54:49,1

"This is my actual area, and it’s clear that he is not talking to a single expert, but probably just parents who are into the vaccine misinformation. It is not mysterious to anyone in the actual professional community about why there are more diagnoses. There are more diagnoses because there were huge updates to the diagnosis about 10 years ago, which expanded the criteria and made many more people eligible for the diagnosis. There are also more diagnoses because it’s common for prevalence to increase when we refine our assessment methods. Many people in the past have missed this diagnosis. Furthermore, it is always common to see a rise in prevalence when diagnostic classifications are created or updated. People still had PTSD before we started calling it PTSD.   If diagnostic classifications are not enough of a reason for you, there has been actual genetic research that has found genetic markers associated with autism. Additionally, older parents are more associated with having autistic children, and as we continue to have children at older ages, there will be some uptick in the prevalence rates. There are already established biological and genetic reasons for occurrence and any increase in prevalence.  Well, you say, it doesn’t rule out the possibility of an environmental factor. And you’re right! That’s why there have been almost 3 decades of research trying to untangle environmental factors, and specifically on vaccines. The overwhelming majority of studies and the professional consensus is that vaccines are not associated with this diagnosis. The doctor who initially started this myth lost his medical license for all of the fraud and abuse in his initial study.  It’s bullshit from top to bottom. It is only being used to dehumanize and propagate eugenics propaganda. We must call it out at every available opportunity and professionals need to resist giving information to these Nazis.  EDIT: I forgot another possibility for an increase in diagnoses… Which is that until this point, governments and social programs have incentivized people to get this diagnosis for their kids because there are often more services offered for it than other developmental diagnoses. It has had a lot of public attention, which results in more services, which incentivizes more services and thus more diagnoses.

"There’s been many studies that show no link between autism and vaccines. The one paper these people like to cite was redacted, and if you read it, their study design was flawed. They chose people who already had autism and then saw if they had a vaccine. This inflates the actual number of people who have autism.  An “unethical” method would be to start with a bunch of unvaccinated children, separate them into a control group and an intervention. The intervention gets vaccines while the control group doesn’t, then check back in a few years and see how many developed autism.  The more “ideal” way most researchers do it, is to look at retrospective data. Find populations of people who are vaccinated and unvaccinated, while being blind of any autism diagnosis. After randomly selecting a somewhat equal random sample of both groups, see how many from each group have autism. Try to control and account for any confounding factors, with the most common ones being, age, gender, race.",leon27607,2025-04-23T11:49:10,9

"Expecting logic from the same people that came up with the brilliant “less Covid testing means less Covid” ideology is like expecting a dog to stop chewing its ass because it tastes bad. There are many possible reasons why autism rates are higher, but one of the most commonly agreed upon theories is that *of course* autism rates are higher when every child is now screened for it at their pediatrician. Kids weren’t screened for autism by default 20 years ago so a lot of autistic kids fell through the cracks and were undiagnosed.

"Joseph P Kennedy Sr. (JFK’s dad) is definitely the worst Kennedy.  He was an open and unabashed anti-Semite.  He was removed from his ambassadorship to England for secretly trying to broker an alliance between England and Germany so America would ally with the Nazis.  He made the pump and dump popular and when Roosevelt picked him to lead the SEC he said “it takes a crook to catch a crook.” He took his son to see Hitler speak.  He was very likely in the mob.  He used his government connections (Roosevelt’s son) to broker a deal to be the sole US distributor of all of England’s best liquors during the prohibition and the day he returned home with a ship load of booze, prohibition was lifted.  He tried to buy a theater chain for $8mil and when the guy said no, Kennedy got women to falsely claim rape against the theater chain owner.  Kennedy bought the chain for $5.3mil during the trial and publicity blowback before the chain owner was acquitted. He was shady to women, having many mistresses he had a position of power over in the film industry, one being actress Gloria Swanson who he managed her business and personal affairs but their relationship ended when he gave her an expensive gift but she realized he charged it to her account (real Harvey  vibes). He made his daughter get a lobotomy without telling his wife because he was worried she would hurt his political career.

Environmental factors may exist that exacerbate autism, but vaccines aren't it. And this results in less parents vaccinating their kids, which means more kids will die or be permanently injured due to entirely preventable diseases.  His actions have also already led to many likely autistic people no longer seeking a diagnosis for fear of what people like him will do with that information.

"American Eugenics Before WWII  In the early 1900s, eugenics became a widely accepted movement in the United States. Its goal was to ""improve"" the genetic quality of the human population. Policies included:  Forced sterilizations of people deemed ""unfit"" (the disabled, mentally ill, poor, minorities, etc.).  Marriage restrictions for certain populations.  Racial segregation and immigration restrictions, notably the Immigration Act of 1924, which severely limited immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and excluded Asians.  States like California led in sterilization practices—by the late 1930s, tens of thousands had been forcibly sterilized in the U.S.  Influence on Nazi Germany  German scientists and policymakers closely studied American eugenics. Several key ways the U.S. influenced Nazi policy include:  Sterilization Laws: Germany’s Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring (1933) was partly modeled on American sterilization laws. U.S. legal precedent—especially the infamous 1927 Supreme Court decision in Buck v. Bell, where Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes upheld compulsory sterilization—was cited by Nazi lawyers as validation.  Racial Theories and Classification: American ideas of racial hierarchy and pseudoscientific theories about ""Nordic superiority"" found receptive audiences in Germany. Prominent U.S. eugenicists corresponded with German counterparts, and some American scientists even praised Nazi eugenics early on.  Immigration Policy Inspiration: The Nazis admired the restrictive U.S. immigration laws for preserving a ""racially pure"" population and used that framework when implementing their own racial policies.  Praise from the Nazis: Leading Nazi eugenicists openly acknowledged American leadership in eugenics. For example, the American eugenicist Harry Laughlin, a key figure in the sterilization movement, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Heidelberg in 1936 for his work.  Important Distinction  While the U.S. heavily influenced Nazi eugenics, it’s important to note that the Nazis took these ideas to an extreme with policies like forced euthanasia, genocide, and the Holocaust. Many American eugenicists distanced themselves from Nazism after the full horrors of the regime became clear.",Ambitious-Score-5637,2025-04-24T04:47:19,1

Last year, another student eloped into the school kitchen and was reaching his hand into a running garbage disposal. I had to wrestle him to the ground to stop him. He had become so obsessed with garbage disposals that his parents had to install a lock the kitchen door. A few months ago they made the heartbreaking decision to send him to live full time in an in-patent facility because they were unable to provide the level of care he needs at home.  This year, I have a student who plays with his own feces and eats toilet paper. Because of this he requires 2 staff members to supervise him in the bathroom. These are not isolated incidents. These are just three examples from three students. I’ve been doing this for over a decade, and I have hundreds more stories. real people, real challenges, and real consequences.  To deny the existence and struggles of individuals with severe autism is not only misinformed, it’s a disservice to them and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them.

"My friend was one of the epidemiologists cut from NIOSH. Everyone should read this:  “I do not often post here but feel that I now must. On April 1, I and more than 2500 colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received emails from the Department of Health and Human Services telling us that our positions had been eliminated. The CDC staff who received these notices worked on preventing childhood lead poisoning, infectious diseases, cancer, asthma, and many other hazardous exposures and illnesses. The terminations included more than 80% of us who work at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), effectively eliminating most of the services NIOSH provides. Since its creation in 1970, NIOSH scientists have been doing the research and providing the direct services that protect US workers from work-related hazardous exposures and related injuries and illnesses. NIOSH provides black lung screenings to coal miners, approves respirators used by frontline workers, evaluates known or emerging health hazards at individual workplaces across the country, conducts research to identify work-related causes of cancer and practical ways to reduce these risks, and provides many other services. NIOSH scientists also serve on the frontlines of emergency response including the Ebola, COVID-19, H5N1 (avian influenza), and measles outbreaks, the East Palestine train derailment, wildfires, and many other emergencies.  The firings that occurred this week are being described to the public as an effort to improve efficiency. Please understand that this was not a reduction in force to save money; it was the elimination of services. There are no other agencies, non-profits, or private businesses that do the work NIOSH does and removing these services will cost us much more in the long run. One of the problems we struggle with in public health is that when we do our jobs effectively, the public does not see it. It is hard to describe the epidemics that we prevented, the workplace deaths and injuries that did not happen, or the cancer diagnoses that someone did not receive because they were protected from a hazardous exposure at work. I do not want us to see what happens when we don't have public health. If you value the right for people to go to work and come home safe in this country, call or write your representatives and tell them that the dismantling of CDC/NIOSH is not acceptable. Tell them we cannot afford to go backwards and that without NIOSH, our workforce loses vital protections.”",thrillafrommanilla_1,2025-04-23T10:36:26,257

"YES.  So historically, if we go back before the criteria was expanded, I think we’re talking more about a population that included a lot of other developmental disabilities and more intellectual disability. I do not think that the United States has fully reckoned with or made reparations for the historical human rights abuses of this population. Even as recently as the early 90s, we had state hospitals that were basically concentration camps. Look up Willowbrook. Look up Pennhurst. My fear with all of these funding cuts is that partially they want to return to this model, and state hospitals were primarily an abuse that came out of a lack of funding and a general apathy for the lack of resources and resulting conditions.  Healthcare accessibility continues to be an issue, especially for individuals with intellectual disability and communication needs. During COVID, individuals with intellectual disability had the highest morbidity from COVID (fact-check if I’m wrong but it was up there for sure) and while I think there are many reasons, healthcare inaccessibility was one of them.",Material-Surprise-72,2025-04-24T07:21:24,2
"I think there’s a lot of merit because something that people still have yet to fully understand is that the state of disability is more than the particular challenges or needs that you have, but also the way your environment has been set up and whether it supports you or harms you.  As a softball example, I have a partially corrected clubfoot and I have a limit to how much I can stand and walk. After about an hour and a half, I need to sit or I’m going to injure myself and have trouble walking for a long time. Most of the time, I can control my circumstances so that I am able to take the breaks that I need, but when I went to Disney World with a packed itinerary planned by others, and had trouble accessing benches because of crowd size, I quickly found myself renting a wheelchair because I could no longer put weight on my foot. Nothing about my foot changed, but the environment and social demands dictated whether I needed a wheelchair or not. And if I hadn’t had the option of renting a wheelchair, I probably would’ve had to spend most of the trip in a hotel.   There has been a lot of research about social media and the Internet and all of the ways that it’s impacting our attention and mental health, and for the most part, these don’t seem to be positive impacts, so while I haven’t looked into this angle of it specifically re: neurodivergence, it makes sense to me.",Material-Surprise-72,2025-04-24T10:51:42,1
"So that’s kind of a tough question to answer. Low functioning isn’t a category in the DSM and there has been a push to shift the language from low functioning to high support needs. The DSM does have some specifiers for things like communication and intellectual disability, which can be used to identify when someone has more support needs.   Since expanding the criteria, the percentage of autistic people with intellectual disability (vs. those without) has steadily gone down as more people without intellectual disability have become eligible for the diagnosis. There was a push by a parent group a few years ago, with some researcher support, that there should be a separate category or that it’s considered a separate kind of autism if you have much more severe needs, and while I personally think that the needs of this group are unique and can get overshadowed, I didn’t personally see anything compelling in their argumentation that they were describing a new diagnosis because we already have ASD with the specifier of intellectual disability.   I don’t think I’ve seen all of the data to suggest that the number of autistic people with intellectual disability has gone up, and my instinct is that the answer is more likely to be no, just considering that the diagnosis of intellectual disability around the globe has steadily gone down. That is multifactoral and complicated. There are environmental factors associated with that, but that can also mean things like being better at substance abuse treatment so less people are born with things like FASD.  So I guess my position is, I don’t think that you’re actually talking about low functioning autism, I think you’re talking about intellectual disability. I’m not sure if I’ve seen data that there are more autistic people with intellectual disability outside of standard population growth. There’s also a lot of data that the prevalence rate of intellectual disability is going down in the US and worldwide.",Material-Surprise-72,2025-04-24T07:04:11,2

"The autism spectrum isn't linear, from zero to full-blown autism, the way that blindness can be quantified.  The spectrum is more like a nebulous cloud that can encompass a lot of different aspects of symptoms.  Understanding those symptoms and how to accommodate them, and the effect they can have in different combinations is helpful for both autistic people, and the people who care for them or are otherwise involved in their lives.  And even with the same symptoms, the same accommodation or treatment won't necessarily work on different people.  So when people are diagnosed, they're not just told 'autism,' they're given specifics that are useful to their own understanding of how THEIR autism manifests.  The reason that high/low-functioning language isn't used is because it's tied to how we value humans based on the language we use to talk about them. High-functioning folks are worth more than low-functioning folks (which was the sort of differentiation that Dr Asperger was making - keep the high-functioning folks, send the low-functioning folks to the camps).  Neurodivergence is difficult to pin down in exact terms and quantifiable traits, because we don't understand the human brain enough to be that precise.  Even with other psycological conditions, we're not completely sure we're addressing the actual causes and underlying issues.  We're doing the best we can with the information we have, and as that information expands, our definitions and distinctions shift.  And as we understand certain conditions better, we see them as less 'other' and attempt to humanise those conditions and change the language that we use to describe them.",boo_jum,2025-04-23T14:09:22,6
There is a scale. Level 1 autism is what was previously called Asperger’s (lower support needs). Level 2 is moderate support needs and level 3 is high support needs. It’s still not a perfect solution but it’s what they’re working with right now,always_lost1610,2025-04-23T18:24:14,3
"I think it's great to use yourself as an example/shield for folks being ignorant or bigoted against neurodiverse people.  Especially if it gives them pause over their unfounded opinions/beliefs.  I have done the same when people have been ignorant or stigmatising over antidepressants.  Lots of folks think that people should be 'strong enough' not to need antidepressants, and my mum framed it this way: no one would tell a diabetic they should be 'strong enough' not to need insulin.  Why is it any different when it comes to brain chemistry?  If that's your preferred diagnosis terminology (and especially if you were diagnosed when that was still the right term for it), there is no problem whatsoever to use that term.  It's just not used now for new diagnoses, and it's not in the DSM-V (afaik), in favour of 'autism spectrum disorder.'  Other terms that have been all or mostly phased out are 'high-functioning' and 'low-functioning,' because of the inherent value-to-society implications of the verbiage.  Now it's all 'on the spectrum' and you get into the specifics from there.  I know that Greta Thunberg uses that term for herself, for example, and I don't like to tell anyone what they can call themselves (though if they do use older/obselete terms, it can raise eyebrows).",boo_jum,2025-04-23T11:45:14,3
"There is always a period of co-mingling older terms and newer terms, especially when folks were diagnosed/adopted the older terms when they were still correct.  As a millennial, a lot of folks I know on the spectrum were diagnosed with Asperger's, and it's still the term they use for themselves, but younger folks who have the same symptom mapping won't be given that label.  The same thing happens around other labels, like in the queer community - older folks in the LGBTQ+ community may see 'queer' as a slur (because it was to their generation), or they may use the word 'transsexual' instead of 'transgender,' because that's what it was called when they came out.  In cases like this, it's more about letting folks self-identify and self-label, with what THEY feel resonates most or they're most comfortable using.",boo_jum,2025-04-23T11:51:49,5

The amount of children she's helped dwarfs that of anyone here.  > To deny the existence and struggles of individuals with severe autism, it’s a disservice to them and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them.  Nobody is denying these cases exist. Yet RFK (and hate groups like Autism Speaks) are denying that people like _me_ and those I care about exist. Cases like mine aren't isolated incidents either, quite the opposite.  If RFK were only talking about the most extreme cases like you deal with, and talking about mitigating severity or improving outcomes, and didn't have such a long history of utter quackery, this would be another story. But he acted like autistic adults don't even exist. He talked about autism like it was a disease or contagion instead of a disorder. And we both know he's going to blame vaccines which have nothing to do with autism as has been proven over and over.  Case in point, he hasn't even mentioned actual promising research in reducing severity like gut biome transplants. Moreover, we know that autism has genetic components. Talking about a cure in that context has obvious historical parallels that have us alarmed.  > You truly have no idea what you’re talking about.  You were acting like nobody disagreeing with RFK has autism, which again clearly shows you have not even looked at or heard from autistic **adults** on the topic.

Nobody's against measures to lower symptoms that severely affect someone's ability to move or talk or their cognition, but the idea that autism is something that can be ""cured"" (ie that it's a disease) is something plenty of people disagree with. Autistic people are by and large perfectly capable of operating in society.  When you start talking about ""curing people"" because they ""can't contribute to society"" for reasons like having difficulty maintaining eye contact or some social difficulties (by the standards of ""normal"" people) then you get into Nazi-esque eugenics, or at the very least a ""Harrison Bergeron"" style pathologizing of every human behavior. I know RFK is coming from the conservative knee-jerk shock of how much autism has been diagnosed in the last few decades, but the real issue isn't people getting diagnosed so they can get treatment, it's the inevitable consequence of his motive to lessen the number of autistic people.

But the existence and success of high-functioning autistic people suggests that any attempt at a blanket ""prevention"" is at best deeply misguided.

">Like what other purpose is there for a society?  The basics are to prevent famine, survive natural disasters, and defend the society against outside threats. As a general rule, there are no independent self-sufficient humans. Societies developed everywhere on Earth for a reason, and that's because ""able bodied"" doesn't mean ""can survive without society"". One farm can get wiped out. One piece of land can be rendered destroyed. A society can save enough seeds to plant next year's crops and subsidize the ruined farms until they can replant. Famine solved, so the society grows. Able bodied people need society to hedge against these kinds of things.  The next benefits are sharing knowledge/culture, living by the same set of laws, and developing public utilities. Living by the same laws is an important one, as no able-bodied human can actually defend their home from other humans 24/7. It's what every prepper in existence has wrong. You simply cannot watch every treeline, door, or fence and stop bandits from showing up in the middle of the night when you finally fall asleep. Society greatly reduces crime as crime isn't even a concept without a society, and the minimal amount of fairness introduced by a common set of laws drastically limits what people will do to each other. Society is what puts you all under the same flag or community, which makes humans behave better towards each other.  All projects of scale or with enough scale of public use benefit from society. Roads for example. You can have private roads and able bodied people could all make their own roads on their own land, but all trade would suffer as a result. If someone's so able bodied that they can produce a lot of goods from their land, then they're going to want a public road so they can actually bring those goods to market where other merchants can reach them. Thus public roads exist virtually everywhere, built by society.  Everyone needs society. Even people who live rural lives need it. And since we all get old eventually, every able bodied person is going to need society more when they get older. Which means we have to take care of the elderly and keep them safe in society, because otherwise it breaks the generational contract and all able bodied people will suffer the same fate when they get older. These kinds of contracts or ideas of fairness permeate society and provide a very natural incentive to take care of people who can't take care of themselves.",RobertTheAdventurer,2025-04-23T17:27:19,33

"You're not the only one. You embody the same instinct that made us band together and be social in the first place. The archeological record shows old people with grave injuries incurred while they were younger - these were people who needed to be taken care of by the group and were. We see, in trepanning, not only the first evidence of veterinary surgery (which I think is fascinating!) but we see the same surgeries performed on humans, we see that they healed and lived out their lives. We were NEVER meant to be going it on our own. Many of us have forgotten. Or maybe a few of us with strong elements of sociopathy have risen to positions and have encouraged so many to forget.    But you're right, this is what we are made for, it's why we feel empathy, why we cooperate, and why we take care of people even when a ledger of profits and loss would say it is a bad fiscal policy. Because we are more than we have become under a twisted system.    I love paying my taxes, knowing it is going to schools and social programs. I don't have kids, and I wasn't the direct beneficiary of those programs, but I don't want to live in a world where we turn our backs to our human siblings and push those in need away from the warmth of the fire.    We aren't the only ones like this. The people lacking empathy are the minority and when you look around, there are more people who think just as we do than those who don't. If we can band together, we can survive this, and if we can survive this, we can build a better society. I'm hoping for us ❤️",UponMidnightDreary,2025-04-23T22:20:57,8

It is good to hear that diagnosis of intellectual disabilities has gone down globally.   Across various forums and subreddits, I have been hearing about a rise in autistic children. I assumed these teachers were referring to ones with lower function, intellectual disabilities, or at the borders of it.

They are however undeniably linked.   Again- if you are in favor of banning food dyes and other harmful chemicals you are not acting like it. You are actively spreading the chemical manufacturers talking points.

"You can speak, communicate effectively, and are able to understand non-literal language. That means you are not who RFK was talking about.   I’m a special education teacher, and I work exclusively with students who have profound autism and require life skills instruction. I can assure you many people vastly underestimate how debilitating autism can be at this level.  The heartbreaking truth is that many of my students are unable to live fully independent lives. Many need 24/7 care and supervision, and not just for their own safety, but for the safety of others. A few years ago, one of my students set fire to a living room couch at 3 a.m. and accidentally killed his younger sister, he just wanted to see the fire trucks. Last year, another student eloped into the school kitchen and was reaching his hand into a running garbage disposal. I had to wrestle him to the ground to stop him. He had become so obsessed with garbage disposals that his parents had to install a lock the kitchen door. A few months ago they made the heartbreaking decision to send him to live full time in an in-patent facility because they were unable to provide the level of care he needs at home.  This year, I have a student who plays with his own feces and eats toilet paper. Because of this he requires 2 staff members to supervise him in the bathroom. These are not isolated incidents. These are just three examples from three students. I’ve been doing this for over a decade, and I have hundreds more stories. real people, real challenges, and real consequences.  To deny the existence and struggles of individuals with severe autism is not only misinformed, it’s a disservice to them and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them.

It is the diegnosis de jure.  >Yet RFK (and hate groups like Autism Speaks) are denying that people like me and those I care about exist  I have a few issues with this.  A) Nobody is denying that autism is a spectrum.  B) This implies that you do not care about people on the more severe end of the spectrum.   >If RFK were only talking about the most extreme cases like you deal with  He was.  >and talking about mitigating severity or improving outcomes  He is.   >and didn't have such a long history of utter quackery, this would be another story.   If you listened to what he actually says you would know that he is far more reasonable than the Reddit echo chamber would have you believe.   >Case in point, he hasn't even mentioned actual promising research in reducing severity like gut biome transplants.   This is because he is actively pushing to have dangerous chemicals banned from our food supply. That was the focus of the talk he gave when he made those comments. These chemicals have been known to have serious neurological side-effects (including worsening the symptoms of autism) and have already been banned by most other countries including Canada and the EU.   >Moreover, we know that autism has genetic components.  So does addiction, but if the high risk person never drinks they are not going to become an alcoholic. Genetic components does not mean an environmental factor cannot trigger the disorder.   >Talking about a cure in that context has obvious historical parallels that have us alarmed.  He has never said there was a cure and the ""obvious historical parallels"" are imaginary. If you want to find a cause you need data to find patterns. As Sherlock Holmes said ""You cannot make bricks without clay"".  >You were acting like nobody disagreeing with RFK has autism  This is not true. There are legitimate reasons to disagree with RFK.

B) The people who are either barely on the spectrum or those who ""self diagnosed"" so they have an excuse to act like an asshole (yes, those people exist) are not who RFK was talking about, and their outrage is the result of manipulation or isolating themselves in an echo chamber of entrenched partisans who have alternative reasons for their opposition.",Darth_Cuddly,2025-04-24T16:31:29,1

Meth is typically “methamphetamine” not methylphenidate.  There are cases of its prescription for narcolepsy in small (5mg) doses.

"Actually they're different mechanisms for all 3 drugs. Heroin can help with dopamine release, because it goes through opiate receptors that cause euphoria, causing a relaxing effect.

Methamphetamine actually stimulates dopamine release and increases dopamine availability.     They do similar things but for very different reasons.

Doctors and therapists do provide as specific of a diagnosis as they're able, but they'll also tell people that when it comes to brain-related stuff, it's not 100% specific, and they're doing the best they can with what they have - ie, symptoms (both observed and self-reported), biometric info like brain scans, family histories, etc.  It's a subjective diagnosis because it's about clusters of symptoms, not just 'do a scan and get the results, positive or negative.'  And when dealing with the public, people shouldn't have to specify their diagnoses.  That's why an overarching label of 'on the spectrum' is a thing that we talk about.

"Once again, the statement you’ve been told to take offense to was actually a specification.  What you've been told to dismiss as a ""generalized statement"" was, in fact, a quantification, one that critics claim was never made.  The reality is that individuals on the severe end of the autism spectrum often require constant supervision and lifelong care. I’m a special education teacher, and I work exclusively with students who have profound autism and require life skills instruction. I can assure you many people vastly underestimate how debilitating autism can be at this level.  The heartbreaking truth is that many of my students are unable to live fully independent lives. Many need 24/7 care and supervision, and not just for their own safety, but for the safety of others. A few years ago, one of my students set fire to a living room couch at 3 a.m. and accidentally killed his younger sister, he just wanted to see the fire trucks. Last year, another student eloped into the school kitchen and was reaching his hand into a running garbage disposal. I had to wrestle him to the ground to stop him. He had become so obsessed with garbage disposals that his parents had to install a lock the kitchen door. A few months ago they made the heartbreaking decision to send him to live full time in an in-patent facility because they were unable to provide the level of care he needs at home.  This year, I have a student who plays with his own feces and eats toilet paper. Because of this he requires 2 staff members to supervise him in the bathroom.  These are not isolated incidents. These are just three examples from three students. I’ve been doing this for over a decade, and I have hundreds more stories. real people, real challenges, and real consequences.  To deny the existence and struggles of individuals with severe autism is not only misinformed, it’s a disservice to them and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them.

The L isomer is not psychoactive and only works on peripheral receptors (such as the ones in the nose, which makes it a powerful decongestant)   Street meth is typically going to be either mostly Dextromethamphetamine (which will be a crystalline form) or racemic (50-50 D/L isomers, which is a powder).

"There was a shortage of actual mdma back around then, if I recall correctly Chinese organized crime took over the route mdma would flow into the US from Canada and they replaced it with “legal” highs that were cheap and easy to acquire. I remember for a while at raves the only tabs going around were piperazines, which I fucking hated. You could tell because the presses were very solid compared to mdma which was crumbly, and they tasted sour instead of bitter. The dark web restored the flow of actual mdma back. I’d get super pure potent stuff in the early ages of the dark web in crystal as well as the good presses from the Netherlands super labs. But age started taking its toll and these days I’m a seizure risk and also take a medication that is active on serotonin receptors and I’m not gonna fuck around and find out. I still have a gram of super pure dark web mdma stashed away somewhere because I romanticize the idea of rolling one last time for a super special occasion, but the longer I am sober the less appealing that gets. It’s been several years since I’ve touched the stuff and about 2 and a half years since I’ve as much as had a drink.

"Ok that actually explains something I noticed (but thought I was maybe just having a ""get these kids off my lawn!"" moment). When I was partying hard, ecstacy tabs everyone knew would be cut with at best neutral filler, at worst meth, but molly/MDMA was expected to be pure or closer to it. Like I didn't say X and molly interchangeably. We'd get molly on Silk Road (using this crazy Bitcoin thing instead of real money) like you said, along with research chemicals from those labs. But some time since, it seems like there's not even a pretense of getting anything pure and they call anything X-like molly. With the dark web crackdowns, people must be relying on street dealings a lot more. And now everything has fentanyl in it anyway.  That horrible rave experience was one of the last times I rolled. I was struggling with a lot of stuff in my personal life and was starting to feel really sad even on MDMA. That kinda freaked me out for my brain so I stopped taking it. I've dabbled with other party drugs since (and still smoke pot and drink), but I still wouldn't ever do ecstasy again.",strawberry_pop-tart,2025-04-23T13:10:22,1
"I originally brought up methylphenidate because the person I replied to said it was the same as meth. Although they're both stimulants and chemically very similar, they (methylphenidate and methamphetamine) are completely different.  Dexmethylphenidate is what's called an optical isomer or enantiomer of methylphenidate, which means it's basically the mirror image of methylphenidate with regards to chemical structure. It's slightly more active than methylphenidate and thus more potent than it is  Other than that the effects are basically exactly the same as methylphenidate.",Sean-Passant,2025-04-23T12:06:26,4

"I am fully aware of what atomoxetine is, and what amphetamines and their derivates/prodrugs are prescribed for. Opioid pharmacology and chemistry are my specialties, but I'm more than familiar with the basics behind Strattera. I'm just letting you know that calling them ""Not depressants,"" is kind of burying the lede. They are, in fact, CNS stimulants. That's what the reuptake of norepinephrine does. It certainly isn't the same as a NDRI, like cocaine, but it's still a stimulant. Here's a source:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK548702/#:~:text=OVERVIEW,%2C%20armodafinil%2C%20pitolisant%20and%20solriamfetol.  Atomoxetine, or Strattera, is literally listed as a CNS Stimulant (edit I originally wrote depressant here by mistake).  Edit: just to clarify, I'm just explaining how it actually works, I'm not saying that some people don't call them ""Non-stimulant drugs."" I'm just saying that's ridiculous. It's the same way how pharmacists call benzodiazepines narcotics even though narcotic actually means opioid. I find the way pharmacists refer to some drugs completely asinine. It's absolutely not backed by factual reality. Another example is how tramadol is called a non-narcotic by pharmacists even though it metabolizes directly into o-desmethyltramadol which is absolutely a narcotic. Pharmacists just make shit up that sounds good, seemingly.",doomed461,2025-04-23T13:45:14,3
"Pressed pills were replaced by piperazines, which were a “legal high” type of thing, for a while “molly” was supposed to be the pure stuff but around the 2010 mark there was a research chemical bk-mdma/methylone that was getting passed off as molly at the time. Methylone to me was enjoyable in its own right, it’s the only thing I’ve had that has made me feel as crazy euphoric like mdma, except methylone you’d feel like you were coming up constantly and instead of peaking into a nice plateau for a few hours like mdma it would kind of drop off out of nowhere around 3 hours in. For a long night you’d have to multiple dose. People would also mix methylone with mephedrone (4-mmc) as a mdma substitute but I was always too nervous to mix research chemicals and found each of those chemicals to be fun enough on their own.     Then there were the MDA analogs 5/6-apb/mapb which I also tried. 5-mapb was supposedly to be pretty close but I’ve found that MDA and anything like it was a bit too trippy for my liking and felt like low dose psychedelic on speed. I had “lost the magic” with mdma after a year or two of fairly regular use and it kind of stopped working entirely on me. Well, I’d feel *something*, but even with pure mdma I’d just feel kind of fucked up, like really drunk or something. I had the absolute best night of my life at a music festival by accidentally dosing around a half a gram of molly that my friends and I assumed was bunk because it was taking a while to kick in. Boy were we wrong but it made for one hell of a night. I chased that euphoria unsuccessfully for years before just kind of giving up. Methylone was the only thing that made me feel kind of close to how mdma used to make me feel, until it was eventually scheduled and banned, and basically went extinct. I couldn’t even find it on the dark web when I tried.    Anyway that was my experience through my 20’s. Still settling into my sober 30’s and it’s definitely a welcome change of pace.",robocoplawyer,2025-04-23T15:11:38,2
