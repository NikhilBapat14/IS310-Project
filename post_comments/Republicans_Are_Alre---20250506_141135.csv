Make sure to infiltrate the Republican party across the US so that they're forced to run against actual candidates instead of being the only name on the ballot. It's hard to lose when you're the only choice.,Financial-Special766,2025-05-06T14:16:18,1454
"They will never stop until they are stopped. These people have no other refuge. It has been decades since the GOP has had anyone other than swindlers in its ranks. It fundamentally does not know how to govern. There's no one left. No adults in the room who know how any of this works.   So they'll never stop doing crime, until they're imprisoned or completely disempowered federally, state and locally.  If you want to stop them then you need to step the fuck up, in some way, somewhere, and oppose them. Hold the line.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T14:16:21,532

">For Trump, this is a question of existential importance, and not just because he doesn’t want Democrats to regain power and litigate everything he’s doing as president. The last time he lost power, after all, he quickly found himself embroiled in several criminal and civil cases, some of which related to his conduct as president. He may have ended up being sentenced to prison had he not won the 2024 election. He believes his political rivals were directly responsible for the legal problems that ensnared him after he left office in 2021 and likely fears returning to life as a private citizen under a Democratic president.  >He’s also spoken recently of seeking out a third term, despite the apparent constitutional restrictions on doing so. If he decides to actually pursue this route, surely it would be nice for him to know that he’d be starting off with a field goal–like advantage, and that, if he loses, he can simply direct the attorney general to start challenging every vote that went against him. That seems a much easier route than the last time he tried to overthrow the government.",thenewrepublic,2025-05-06T14:12:20,138

Basically what I've found from reading around, and fucking with GPT is that a simple way to do that is to list all the different narratives that support the conspiracy, and then remove one or two and see if the plausibility of the story collapses. To be even more accurate you can go through those narratives systemically, weighing each narrative, and then deciding whether to remove them If the theory stops making sense, then it's more likely to be bullshit.  So going back to the ""unusual voting patterns evidence"", let's just remove it completely - pretend that evidence doesnt exist at all.  You still have to consider all the other shit that suggests that the election was compromised (even if you ignore the voting pattern evidence), to see if that makes sense. Things like him praising Elon's knowledge with ""vote counting computers"", the warnings from Election groups being ignored, shutting down all the FBI investigations into Russia, the bomb hoaxs on election day... all of those things still point to conspiracy.",Minimum_Guitar4305,2025-05-07T09:41:10,1

"> Yeah, i don’t know why he calls that racist.  Can't profess to speak for the guy since I'm not him, but I believe his argument would be:  * If you dismiss the impacts of voter suppression at all (which you at least aren't doing) you're ignoring a shameful American practice that's as old as apple pie. * To which I would probably add (and I realize that the ""unusual patterns"" are set aside for the purpose of this convo) - claiming stuff like Starr County, TX or Imperial County, CA flipping red was because of machine meddling *can* bring about a vibe of denying the agency of previously-reliable voters who've been shifting away from Dems in the Trump era and ignoring their electoral actions for something more comforting (""[The Obama coalition isn't in the process of fracturing, it was the machines that nerfed Dem. support in Hispanic communities](https://i.imgflip.com/1jgrgn.jpg?a485088)""). * There's also how ""legal"" suppression itself (and broader racial inequities) are an explanation behind some of the ""unusual patterns"" seen, namely those of lower-turnout precincts being Dem. leaning and higher-turnout ones being GOP leaning.  And I assume given he's been contracted by the ACLU to write these kinds of reports in the past he feels extra strongly about not paying attention to racial disparities in ballot access.  > To be even more accurate you can go through those narratives systemically, weighing each narrative, and then deciding whether to remove them If the theory stops making sense, then it's more likely to be bullshit.  > So going back to the ""unusual voting patterns evidence"", let's just remove it completely - pretend that evidence doesnt exist at all.  Grand, because going through the variety of sub-narratives that make up that point takes far too long for one Reddit post capped at 10K characters. Let's go through the rest:  > Things like him praising Elon's knowledge with ""vote counting computers""  This is something that relies on there being unusual patterns in the vote results (esp. in PA, which is the state Trump name-dropped in those quotes). With them, you can make the case it's Trump nefariously teasing at a master plan of his. Without those patterns, it's the babble of someone pushing 80 whose brain is rapidly turning into pudding. He [had a whole interview where he was amazed Barron could turn on a laptop computer](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/trump-boasts-son-barron-turn-100055082.html) - it doesn't take much for him to praise someone's technical aptitude.   > the warnings from Election groups being ignored  This absolutely happened, but similar warnings about vulnerabilities in election tech have been published for years and years at this point (I assume you mean pre-election and not post-election ones). What'd make these noteworthy would be corresponding ""weird results"" in jurisdictions that used vulnerable machines - which for the purpose of this post we've removed completely.  > shutting down all the FBI investigations into Russia  This absolutely took place, and is a sign of Trump covering for Russia to stop probes into their 2024 election interference. It supports there being an effort to interfere, but doesn’t pin down any sort of scale of interference. Just like poking a cop and punching a cop would probably get you the same assault charge, running some bot accounts telling people they can vote by text and injecting code into tabulators to manipulate the results in 70% of American counties both fall under interference. The scale of one, however, is far larger than the other.  > the bomb hoaxes on election day   These also verifiably happened from Russian source emails/VOIPs, but the *why* people ascribe to them varies:  * For some, these were attempts to both suppress the vote in Dem. strongholds on Election Day (IIRC a disproportionate number of the threats went to majority Black and Native precincts) by wasting finite voting hours on police sweeps of empty buildings, cause chaos for municipal and state emergency services in general (because there were threats in rural GOP counties as well), and try to scare the average American into not voting the same way militant attacks in 2004 Iraq or 2009 Afghanistan attempted to scare voters in those countries’ elections.  * For others, these were engineered windows of opportunity for Republican volunteers to run in with a flash drive of malware and infect tabulators to flip votes for Trump.  But for the latter to be the case, you’d expect to see weird voting patterns *localized to the precincts where bomb threats occurred*. But you don’t – not just in a “they’re discarded for the purposes of this post” sense, but because all of the “weird pattern” discourse I’ve seen talks about things at a countywide, statewide, or national level. If machine exploits elsewhere allowed for code to be installed on 70% of the nation’s tabulators without physical access, you wouldn’t need the bomb threats to provide physical access to GOP-aligned operatives to install the rigging logic. If the rigging logic could only be installed with physical access, you’d expect to see very-localized anomalies in the vote at specific polling stations that had bomb threats.  Just the bomb threats alone and the following kiboshing of the FBI investigation point to Russian interference and Trump attempting to cover it up. [There’s a whole Wikipedia article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2024_United_States_elections). But interference doesn’t explicitly = hacked. If Russia knew that they could get Their Guy into office through a nationwide tabulator hack, there’d be no reason to spend time and effort on bot farm operations, creating AI-generated images and videos, or subsidizing right-wing influencers like Rubin/Pool. The cash and manpower spent on the aforementioned would have been better put to use on funding/feeding their ongoing quagmire in Ukraine had the result of the election already been preordained.  I also want to flag this paragraph from the wiki article, covering prior interference attempts – my emphasis added:  > A declassified intelligence report in December 2023 assessed with ""high confidence"" that Russian interfered during the 2022 midterms in efforts that grew from its prior attempts during the 2018 midterms. Efforts were described as seeking ""to denigrate the Democratic Party before the midterm elections and ***undermine confidence in the election***, most likely to undermine US support for Ukraine"". It highlighted efforts to delay a withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson until after the midterms to avoid giving a named political party a political win, targeting constituencies more sympathetic to Russia's ""traditional values"", and weakening confidence in Western democratic institutions by ***casting ""aspersions on the integrity of the midterm elections, including by claiming that voting software was vulnerable, Americans expected cheating to undermine the midterm elections, and Democrats were stealing the elections***.""  Online actors who put together some scatter plots of vote results that “look wonky” and proceed to claim there’s “receipts” for vote-switching in 2024 without thoroughly ruling out more benign, more-likely explanations (and I haven’t seen that from the main people posting the “weird patterns”) are playing directly into Putin and the Russian government’s hands.",hunter15991,2025-05-07T11:39:35,0
