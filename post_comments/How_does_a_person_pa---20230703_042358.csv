"Great question, and way to be proactive about getting involved!  Here’s how it goes: You show up wherever your local community is caucusing (usually a high school gym, library, church, or something similar but sometimes individual households, too).  If you have a candidate in mind to support, you walk toward their designated area of the gymnasium. If you don’t have someone in mind, you can go up to the other groups and ask why you should support their preferred candidate.  At an appointed time, the caucus leader will call for a vote, and each group presents how many people are supporting their preferred candidate.  Usually, after the first round, the *least* preferred candidate is eliminated, and their supporters will reallocate themselves to their second-preferred candidates (there’s usually a viability threshold percentage that candidates have to meet to continue on to the next round).  In the midst of all of this, people are trying to persuade you to join their group; this can take the form of actual candidate talking points, or in some cases literal bribery (eg “Hey, Steve, I’ll buy you a drink after the caucus if you join us.”)  They can get heated as people get more dug in to their respective positions. Usually there is alcohol involved for of age people (BYOB).   When the caucus is adjourned, delegates are appointed based on percentage of caucus goers votes. Those numbers are reported, by precinct, to the state party who then tabulates and announces delegate count to the media.",S-Seaborn,2023-07-03T23:10:53,4
"It’s similar to ranked choice, but there’s a portion where you can go and talk to other people and try to convince them to join your group.",Zeddo52SD,2023-07-03T20:29:15,0
"Oh I see. So almost like a long version of ranked choice voting then... lol. The bribery part seems it shouldn't be allowed though... i don't like that lol. I appreciate all of the information you have laid out here. My only question just to make sure though would be is it always the case that truly anyone can show up and participate? I have been hearing conflicting things regarding the process of showing up or who is allowed to be involved. Could it perhaps be different state-by-state, or is it always the case of how you described? This is the most informed answer I have gotten so far, so I really do appreciate all of it a lot. Thank you!! :)",Captain_501st,2023-07-05T00:42:36,1
"I just read that what you described is actually the way the Democrat primary works. A Republican caucus is where all the candidates give speeches stating their plans, then a secret vote is done by everyone there and whoever gets the most votes is the Republican candidate.",Hopeful-Guidance-83,2024-05-04T17:06:50,1
"Oh I see. I love RCV personally. I suppose what I'm really wondering also though is can just anyone show up? Or how does that process of ""getting in"" work so to speak.",Captain_501st,2023-07-05T00:34:24,1
"> the bribery part…  For what it’s worth, more than often, it’s good natured rubbing between neighbors within communities.   > My only question just to make sure though would be is it always the case that truly anyone can show up and participate?  Unless this law is changing along with caucus implementation, MO has historically been an “Open Primary” state, meaning that any registered voter can participate without belonging to a specific party.  > Could it perhaps vary state-by-state?  Caucus processes can definitely vary state-by-state. NV was different in some ways than IA, but the general gist if “voting with your feet” and “retail politicking” is the same. And states are free to set their own eligibility guidelines for participation.",S-Seaborn,2023-07-05T02:52:51,1
"You need to be registered to vote in the precinct/district you live in. That’s really it, barring any local election law that adds stipulations.",Zeddo52SD,2023-07-05T07:26:56,1
"Oh I see. I'm familiar with it being an open primary state, I just meant that I have been told only doners can show up to causes, so just wanted to make sure that wasn't true and that I could in fact partake lol. Thanks for all that!! :)",Captain_501st,2023-07-06T01:36:03,1
"Oh I see. Okay, just making sure that it is something open to the public. I'll try bringing along as many people when the time comes, lol. Also, I'm not sure why your comment got down voted... you're not wrong. It is a similar thing to RCV... just... a lot longer and more drawn out, lol. Thanks for all ur help and info! :)",Captain_501st,2023-07-06T01:42:34,2
"I came here with the same original question. This is all I had found.  Democrats will sill hold a primary with mail-in and in-person voting. https://spectrumlocalnews.com/mo/st-louis/news/2023/08/31/missouri-political-parties-scrambling-to-create-presidential-primary--caucus-rules-for-2024  Looks like there will be some sort of pre-registration, but Republicans still don't have much information https://missouri.gop/missouri-gop-2024-caucus/",jboverman,2024-01-13T17:45:54,1
