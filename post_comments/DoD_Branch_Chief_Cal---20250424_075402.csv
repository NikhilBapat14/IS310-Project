This clown is going to be fired so hard for trying to chat up this journalist lol.,LemartesIX,2025-04-24T08:56:40,93

An air force (I think?) commander got removed from command for not putting up a picture of Trump as the head of the chain of command.  How does this guy think this will turn out?  On the upside... Gotta love when they self-report.  Soooo much easier to get rid of them.,Shadeylark,2025-04-24T09:59:15,47
Imagine saying that nobody including yourself should be in that leadership position!,red-african-swallow,2025-04-24T10:28:52,19
The average age of the people who started the Revolution was around 20. Tell me again how someone is too young. The Founders believed that 25 was quite old enough to be a member of Congress. It is codified in the Constitution at that age.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-24T10:11:46,27

"> He questioned Hegseth’s qualifications, calling him “insanely young to be the part” and adding, “he wasn’t that high up in the military.”  I think that was the point. After a certain rank, you become less military and more politician. Trump likes to hear from the guys on the ground, so being a lower rank probably makes Pete more qualified.",BrockLee76,2025-04-24T10:05:12,12
"These people are such clowns. I did 3.5 years at the Pentagon doing high-level briefing, etc. Most people there are great, but there’s this % of people like this dude, who’ve been in a liberal echo chamber their whole lives. They’re clinically insane and think they know how everything should be done. It was a little scary knowing they held TS clearances or higher.  OBTW, Sec. Austin was the absolute worst. A fern would do a better job than Austin, so ole’ Pete will be just fine.",BBBF18,2025-04-24T14:20:49,3
I've never understood that method of thought. That's not my president! So then are you going to start running red lights and ignoring laws? Total dumbass move.,DreadPirateGriswold,2025-04-24T19:26:56,2

I mean it’s kinda fucked up ethically.  They essentially set him up didn’t say they were a reporter didn’t say it was a recording. DC is a one party consent law legally so they are fine but think about it we all have talked shit about our bosses to others.,Stained_Dagger,2025-04-24T15:11:04,-28
I hope they do more than just fire him. He needs prosecuted for failing to execute his duties.,Leroyf1969,2025-04-24T09:08:41,40

">I DO NOT trust him with the safety and security of myself, my family, and the rest of this country  Agree, and I'm sure Pete Hegseth is deep in injun country.  He's probably surrounded by the deep state the way LameStream media is portraying it in their stories.",GiediOne,2025-04-25T00:36:23,2
"This midwit forgets Chuck Hegel who was ""just"" a Sergeant. When Trump picks former Generals he gets accused of creating a ""junta."" When he picks others they're called ""inexperienced.""
