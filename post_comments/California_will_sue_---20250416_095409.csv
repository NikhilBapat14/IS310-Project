I‚Äôd actually be happy to have the tariffs go through Congress.  It‚Äôs their constitutional duty anyway.  Right now they are doing next to nothing.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-16T11:46:36,424
"Makes sense for California considering they have the largest west coast ports.  Curious to know how much money they make just from importing and sending goods down the logistic chain to other states.  Expanding on that I also wonder how much extra the average person has to pay considering the high cost of living in these west coastal cities as well as any state/county taxes looking to get a piece of that pie, also wondering if that‚Äôs why some companies decide to go through Mexico to import to USA.",Classical_Liberals,2025-04-16T10:28:14,90
Not entirely sure if the State of California would have legal standing to challenge the executive branch's invocation of International Emergency Economic Powers Act.  I believe any challenge would have to come from congress.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-16T10:36:11,45

Another frivolous lawsuit,SonnyC_50,2025-04-16T10:19:55,21
"On what basis?  Regulation of international commerce isn't an issue states even have standing on.    I mean, of course, Newsome will judge shop this to the most liberal federal judge he can find but once this gets to a competent bench, that judge will remind the gentle governor of California that duties, authorities and how they're divided in this country are dictated by this document called the Constitution of the United States...and nowhere in there do states have a single thing to say about tariffs.  He's an embarrassment to California and America in general.",Euroranger,2025-04-16T11:46:23,13
Is this before or after California accepts federal relief for the fires California caused?,TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-16T10:23:26,17

"He lacks standing. Congress would have it as the breadth of Trump's tariffs might exceed the authority delegated to him by Congress, but Congress doesn't seem interested in suing, so that is moot.  So this is mostly performative nonsense from a man hwo wants to run for President.",cathbadh,2025-04-16T11:51:02,1

"and how would you propose they do that?  pull the other 10% out their butts?  you need 60% to get anything done.  they barely have 50.  you think a dem will help? not possible.  they can do nothing but pass the budget, that needs 50, all else needs 60.",_Vardos_,2025-04-16T15:35:00,5
"If they go through congress, we won‚Äôt see any progress until 2028. Why do you think Trump is doing everything through EO? Congress is useless and corrupt to the core.¬†",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-16T16:03:12,-22
Has that Federal money went out for the California wildfires?  I hope not!,GeoffreyArnold,2025-04-16T11:34:19,-85
They could challenge it that‚Äôs not a enumerated power of the president and that is unlawful. It‚Äôs the same thing that happened with gun owners and ATF regulation.,Stained_Dagger,2025-04-16T18:28:05,20

Lawfare has been their plan. They don't want Trump to succeed because it will expose their grift that they said is impossible to fix.,kaytin911,2025-04-16T11:00:28,25

"I said it before the election... While the voting left was being gaslit into believing Kamala had a chance, the puppet masters were making plans to obstruct and slow down Trump.  This is the end result.",Shadeylark,2025-04-16T11:48:08,0

"If they don‚Äôt go through congress the next Democrat president can reverse every Trump EO on the first day.  Besides, the tariffs could use a bit more planning and communication.  Right now businesses don‚Äôt know what to do with all the uncertainty.  When uncertainty is high, investment is pulled back and prices are raised to compensate for unknown risks - exactly the opposite of what we want.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-04-16T17:00:48,79

"Twenty, even ten, years ago a California Democrat might had a chance on the national stage.  But the polarization has reached such a critical point, and California is too emblematic of everything wrong with the left to right-leaning voters, that someone like Newsome has no chance of winning enough swing states, let alone any red states.",Shadeylark,2025-04-16T11:51:13,4
