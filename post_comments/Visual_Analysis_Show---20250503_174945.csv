"It isn’t just about Trump, though. Americans have gulped down a steady diet of propaganda about the Middle East for the last century, to the point where atrocities against Arabs, and in particular Arab Muslims, barely even register as being wrong anymore. Go and suggest to any American that perhaps bombing the Middle East indiscriminately is wrong and listen to their response—they’ll likely start babbling about swords and Sharia law. I know that because I live here, it’s a fucking nightmare. So many people don’t realize and/or don’t care about the catastrophic damage we’ve done to the Middle East and all of the associated humanitarian crises.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-05-03T18:40:39,89

"Yes, you point out another weird imbalance in this world.    Americans are probably the most ignorant people about the rest of the world of any major nation.  And yet America has a bigger effect on the world economically and military than any other major nation.   I'm 72 and my protest days go back to the Vietnam War era. I've also protested, and written to my Congress critters about our actions in South America and the Middle East and other parts of the world and I've traveled extensively in them also.   And consistently on every topic I've been struck by how incredibly ignorant my fellow Americans are about other countries. I come back from places and tell people where I've been and they're like, ""where's that?""     And for decades and decades this American ignorance  has caused vast suffering and death around the world.   So I suppose there's a certain justice in the fact that that same American ignorance has now resulted in someone being elected president who will destroy our country the way we have destroyed so many others.

"I mean the North Vietnamese had control of most of the country and the US was at war with them.  There were more Vietnamese soldiers in Cambodia than Cambodian soldiers, and despite the best efforts of the later the former wouldn’t leave.
