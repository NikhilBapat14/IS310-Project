"Part of the problem is the perverse incentives by the gun control lobby to increase the quantity and severity of gun violence for the purpose of promoting gun control, and making a populace malleable to their narrative.",FreeGrabberNeckties,2025-05-08T01:42:29,1
"The gun violence in the US is all just advertising for those products. That's why the NRA literally celebrates every time there's a mass shooting. To them that's a ""feature not a bug"". it's all about money and gun sales and nothing else.",Radfactor,2025-05-07T15:35:57,1
Won't even read this. Humans are the same all around the world. Americans laws just make it easy for people to kill each others.  Lack of free healthcare is also an issue.,NorthenFreeman,2025-05-07T15:41:47,1
"A new episode of *Economics, Applied* asks why America has so many homicides involving firearms each year. Host [Steven J. Davis](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/steven-j-davis) speaks to Jens Ludwig about his deeply researched new book on gun deaths in America. Professor Ludwig teaches at the University of Chicago’s Harris School of Public Policy and serves as director of the University’s Crime Lab, as well as co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research’s working group on the economics of crime. Davis and Ludwig discuss why America has so many gun deaths, how traditional narratives fail to explain most gun violence, and why past policies failed to reduce the deadly toll. Ludwig advances a fuller explanation for gun violence, grounded in evidence and behavioral insights, building on the arguments in his 2025 book, [*Unforgiving Places: The Unexpected Origins of American Gun Violence*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/U/bo244203115.html).",HooverInstitution,2025-05-07T15:30:15,0
