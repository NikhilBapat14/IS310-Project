"I think this is a splendid idea. It should take several years to be built, and hopefully, it'll be completed by the end of 2028 so we can send some of the worst criminals in the United States there. We can start with Donald Trump, JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, and all the current cabinet members and many of the administration participants from the first Trump fiasco. Then, we can send the 1600 felons from January 6th on new charges and convictions. How ironic it'll be to have some of the worst criminals in the very place that Donald Trump built and had made ready for.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-05T05:36:44,19
I am convinced that he watched The Rock or Escape from Alcatraz or something and that is what inspired this. Maybe he’ll watch Escape from New York tomorrow and proclaim that he’s turning the entirety of Manhattan into a walled off prison.,throwawaylol666666,2025-05-05T05:42:48,9

"Donald Trump has directed his government to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on a California island, to house “America’s most ruthless and violent offenders”.  Trump said he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI and Homeland Security “to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt Alcatraz”.  In a message on his Truth Social site on Sunday evening, Trump wrote: “For too long, America has been plagued by vicious, violent, and repeat Criminal Offenders, the dregs of society, who will never contribute anything other than Misery and Suffering.  “When we were a more serious Nation, in times past, we did not hesitate to lock up the most dangerous criminals, and keep them far away from anyone they could harm. That’s the way it’s supposed to be.  He added: “The reopening of ALCATRAZ will serve as a symbol of Law, Order, and JUSTICE.”  Trump later told reporters the reopening the prison was “Just an idea I’ve had” and decided to act on.  “It’s a symbol of law and order,” he said.  A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement that the agency “will comply with all Presidential Orders”.  But Nancy Pelosi, former Speaker of the House and Democratic lawmaker from California, said it was “not a serious” proposal.  “Alcatraz closed as a federal penitentiary more than 60 years ago. It is now a very popular national park and major tourist attraction. The President’s proposal is not a serious one,” she said in a post on X.  The San Francisco prison – infamously inescapable due to the strong ocean currents and cold Pacific waters that surround it – was known as The Rock and housed some of the nation’s most notorious criminals, including gangster Al Capone and George “Machine Gun” Kelly.  It has long been part of the cultural imagination and has been the subject of numerous movies, including *The Rock* starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.  In the 29 years it was open, 36 men attempted 14 separate escapes, according to the FBI. Nearly all were caught or did not survive the attempt.  Alcatraz Island is now a major tourist site that is operated by the National Park Service and is a designated National Historic Landmark.",theipaper,2025-05-05T05:27:53,1

He should be its first and only prisoner as was Napoleon Bonaparte on the island of St Helena.   It was closed because the concrete became porous from rusted plumbing using seawater for showers etc and is easily tunnelled.

"The closure of the federal prison in 1963 was attributed to crumbling infrastructure and the high costs of repairing and supplying the island facility, because everything from fuel to food had to be brought by boat.  It was nearly three times more costly to operate than any other federal prison, the Federal Bureau of Prisons website said.  The Bureau of Prisons has 16 penitentiaries performing the same high-security functions as Alcatraz, including its maximum-security facility in Florence, Colorado, and the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, which is home to the federal death chamber.  The order comes as Trump clashes with the courts as he tries to send accused gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador without due process.  Trump has also directed the opening of a detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to hold up to 30,000 of what he has labelled the “worst criminal aliens”.
