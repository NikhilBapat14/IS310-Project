"No, you cant look for a majority when there is no majority. And you cant govern with a minority.  The only thing they could do is out of governmental politics. Do what the government does not do. Help people against their landlords, do social work, provide free aid to people who need it. I mean why would you get this insane amount of money for a campaign by some rich people, but not for actual work that would be the best campaign and would help finding not only new voters, but also active members for the party?  At least this is what the KPÖ in austria did and what the left party wants to do in Germany, and this worked (even without financial support by left leaning billionaires). A strong out of parliament opposition can be more influential than the governing party. And isnt this all what democracy should be about? Small governments are only a possible option when there is enough political work done on a local level.",Lauchiger-lachs,2025-03-17T09:24:55,10
"Short answer: nothing   Longer answer: They could have shut down the government. Then Trump would have declared everything he liked ""essential"" and sat back and waited for the Dems to cave",Objective_Aside1858,2025-03-17T09:11:34,14
"They could have filibustered and prevented the CR from taking effect. That would have resulted in a government shutdown which i guess Shumer viewed as a worse outcome than allowing the CR to become law. But the Dems absolutely could have stopped the CR, they chose to let it become law. Senate Dems could oust Schumer as the minority leader too, if they want to. Or someone could run against him in his primary next time (AOC)",notawildandcrazyguy,2025-03-17T09:50:17,7
Senator Schumer chose the lesser of two evils. I agree with his decision. A government shutdown would have played right into the hands of DOGE.   I’m not outraged. I’m not a conservative.   I think most of this screaming for Schumer’s head is optics. The majority of the Democratic Senators know a government shutdown would be a disaster. But they have to make noises to appease their progressive constituents.   How could you know there was no input? I don’t think you know. I’m sure there was plenty of input. When has anyone been able to get that many Americans to shut-up? Seriously!,Curiosity-0123,2025-03-17T15:44:36,3
"He was boxed. The ""blame"" if blame must be named, is the goddam Republicans, and the goddam democrats that didn't vote. That said, this ain't 19990 anymore, and it's time for Chuck to go. The Senate is no longer a deliberative body,  and playing nice means losing America to the New Fascists. We need new leadership, at least in the Senate, and no more Mr. Nice Guy. Hard ball all the time. Smite them hip and thigh. Get the majority and force Sec States to stop messin' with the voter rolls. Pass new laws to override cheesy SC rulings.",wereallbozos,2025-03-17T19:18:18,2
What do you mean Dems didn’t have any input. It’s largely the CR that has been passing since sometime last year.,BuildBackRicher,2025-03-18T18:17:43,2
The only reason I can think of for why Chuck Schumer caved and voted for it was a government shutdown would stop judges from stopping Trumps unconstitutional actions. Courts would be closed.,hereiswhatisay,2025-03-17T22:24:21,1
I am hoping the Democrats pick AOC for their new leader. I think that's where the Democrats want to be. They've become the party of the ridiculous and she is perfect to lead that party. Can't wait for midterms.,Afraid-Amphibian-371,2025-03-18T09:07:04,1
"The DP could have defied DJT and the slim RP majority and forced a shutdown.  Politically risky? Yes.  As politically risky as caving?   IMO, No.",DyadVe,2025-03-18T10:55:12,1
"What would Mitch McConnell have done?  For each question, the Dems need to keep asking this question. And then do it. That's how you effectively oppose the majority government.",BJPark,2025-03-17T09:33:31,13
"My issue is that the Schumer Democrats wholly accepted the narrative that Democrats were the ones shutting down the government by voting no.    Granted, no one on the left was helping with this narrative. Their language was to shut it down ---- which was absolutely maddening to watch. Like seeing them beg their Representatives to get arrested as a show of faith.    Democrats needed to reject this idea that it was them shutting down the Government and it was Republicans using a shut down to pass bad legislation. Put it all on Republicans. Who really wants to shut down the government and keep it shut down? -- Republicans. If Trump wants it shut down for six months or a year, let him defend that.     But it isn't exactly true. What's probably more likely, and sorry to be cynical, is the Dow has been dropping like a rock all week, and averting a shut down stopped that bleeding. His decision was about protecting investors.",Ssshizzzzziit,2025-03-17T10:33:18,3

Ya I think she could primary him in 2028 I believe.  Thats a long time.,jpcapone,2025-03-17T10:06:41,3
Schumer’s argument was a shutdown government wouldn’t have judges courts available to stop all of Trumps unconstitutional actions.,hereiswhatisay,2025-03-17T22:27:05,1
The CR was essentially the only hurdle to the passing of the spending bill which had no input from democrats.  If that is wrong please enlighten me.  Seriously don't mind being corrected.,jpcapone,2025-03-19T07:22:17,1
Mitch McConnell would have let the government shut down because *Republicans don't care if the government is shut down*,Objective_Aside1858,2025-03-17T09:42:16,8
"I get where you’re coming from, but asking WWMD (what would Mitch do?) highlights the problem perfectly.  Mitch spent *DECADES* using government shutdowns to put public pressure on the majority. One might say, “well, the dems should have done that!”, but that misses the point that Trump is **NOT** a president. He is a dictator in training. If the government shut down, the ensuing chaos would literally hand over complete control to Trump’s regime.   DOGE already has access to the payment systems, so they don’t need any in-house personnel. The courts are putting up the stiffest resistance to the regime, and in the event of a shutdown their dockets would grind to a halt within a few weeks. The few “good eggs” still rolling around in the federal government would be sent home until the shutdown is resolved. Shutting down would give the Trump regime everything they need (and the perfect excuse) to remove the last few remaining safeguards against tyranny. I can *very* easily see a narrative forming along the lines of “After we shut the government down, we realized that 75+% of the federal workforce is un-needed. They will not be returning to their posts.”  And, not for nothing, the narrative had already been laid out in right wing propaganda that “Chuck shut the government down.” It’s completely backwards and incorrect, but I legitimately heard this from a person in meatspace.  I want to see dems fight harder, but (at the risk of this aging like milk) Schumer was choosing to fight another day. There’s a nonzero chance that if the government shut down, it would *never* re-open. At least not in a recognizable form.",Unputtaball,2025-03-17T09:46:51,11

I can appreciate the nuance you provided.  I would say that the initial deal left open the door for further negotiation which has not occurred.  In the end he capitulated at a very inopportune time.  I added this link to provide some more context.

So they should do something performative that accomplishes nothing but give Trump greater power to shut down agencies he doesn't like?,Objective_Aside1858,2025-03-17T11:23:39,1
"Or they put it back in the Republican's court, make demands that either the house gets their ass back immediately to pass something everyone can sign, or Senate Republicans take drastic measures to pass it. If they don't want a shutdown, as they've said, then they should prove it.   As far as the shut down is concerned, who cares if they gut things fast today or tomorrow. The end result will be the same. So, if Republicans are hell bent on shutting down the government, let them eat that sandwich now and then they can come back and tell us all if they prefer the taste.   Edit: Also, Democrats shouldn't put their name on anything Republicans want to pass. If Republicans can't do it with their numbers then they should not expect Democrats to shoulder the burden, and if they can't they should invite Democrats to be part of the process.   Schumer did nothing but grumble and give speeches.",Ssshizzzzziit,2025-03-17T11:44:52,4
