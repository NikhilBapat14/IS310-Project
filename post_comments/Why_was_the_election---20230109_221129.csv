The president pro tempore is a ceremonial position.  The majority leader has all the real power.    I don't know how that position gets decided but I imagine it happens behind closed doors.,cantdressherself,2023-01-11T01:04:40,2
"The President Pro Tempore doesn't really have any power, unlike the House. It's largely a ceremonial position that doesn't matter, so they just give it to the most senior member of the majority power unless there's some other factor at play not to. The House is much more meaningful because the Speaker sets the agenda and plays a major role in the legislative function of the House.  That said, struggling this much to elect a Speaker is very unusual. The last time a Speaker took more than one ballot to elect was a century ago. The failures of this House to elect a Speaker quickly is indicative of their struggles with basic government functions. So in some ways, yes, the current group of Senators leading the Senate (who are Dems) are more ""mature"" than the House (led by Reps). But that's not so much a commentary on the characteristics of the chambers as much as it is a commentary on the specific current iteration of the Republican party.",mormagils,2023-01-11T09:34:03,2
"Since the 1940s, the president pro tempore has always been the senior member of the majority party. While the Speaker of the House has actual power in setting the agenda, the president pro tempore is just the person who fills in for the Vice President (who is the President of the Senate) when they are absent and the Vice President only presides over sessions and has no power over the Senate.  Because of this, the parties don't argue with who gets it. The party in majority picks the president pro tempore, and they use a method of voting called uninamous consent, which means if no one specifically objects, then all agree.  Fun fact about our current president pro tempore, she is actually not the senior Democrat. The senior Democrat didn't want the job.  It should also be noted that the position is so cermonial at this point that they don't even actually preside over Senate sessions. By tradition, junior members preside over the Senate (and House) for experience. Only for important stuff will they actually preside.",Shakezula84,2023-01-11T12:42:58,1
Its usually the Senator with the longest continuous service from the majority party and chosen by a resolution which is adopted by unanimous consent without a formal vote. Upon the retirement of Leahy (D-VT) Patty Murray (D-WA) was next up.,[deleted],2023-01-11T09:02:08,5

The Vice President is the *President* of the Senate.,Tetepupukaka53,2023-01-16T06:45:30,1
> So the senate functions a bit different than the house?  Very differently. They are two separate bodies with  different roles in the legislative process. Each house of Congress may adopt their own rules and procedures.,[deleted],2023-01-11T09:03:39,2
"Yes, the President Pro Temp is usually the most senior member of the majority party and has no real impact on legislation.",HiggetyFlough,2023-01-11T09:07:00,2
"Yes, as others have said, they each operate by their own rules.",cantdressherself,2023-01-15T15:51:20,1
"Which has what to do with the president pro tempore?  I don't know Latin, does that mean the pro tempore is the stand in for the vice president when they are not in the chamber?",cantdressherself,2023-01-16T15:43:12,1
Exactly.  The Vice-President can preside over any proceedings they choose.,Tetepupukaka53,2023-01-22T15:08:31,1
