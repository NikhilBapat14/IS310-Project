DEI is literally the solution to nepotism and cronyism.   That’s why they hate it. It’s not because unqualified people are able to get jobs because of their skin color. It’s because unqualified people are now competing with qualified people of color for the jobs they expected to be handed.,Nate-dude,2025-04-26T21:50:55,27
"But that's suggesting that people actually lose out as a result of DEI?  Adding people to a pool of candidates where they otherwise wouldn't be doesn't result in candidates that were already in the running ""missing out"".   Suggesting nepotism is in anyway equal is affirming the notion that DEI results in healthy-NT-cis-het-white ~~wo~~men missing out on postions.  When that's simply not what DEI is about.   ____  Although some would say the D does cause missing out because using boards as an example, old boards would be some 12 white men, with modern boards having less white men. But DEI is about how it should never have been 12 white men, not about pushing out white men to make space for others.",Clarine87,2025-04-26T14:50:42,20

"Eugenics was born in England by Francis Galton in 1883.  You're correct about the forced sterilization, though - 32 States had laws allowing forced sterilization of those deemed unfit to breed, including the poor, disabled, ""feeble minded"", non-white, ""sexually deviant"", etc.  In 1927, the Supreme Court upheld the Virginia Serialization Act of 1924 in Buck v. Bell, making it legal throughout the US, with justice Oliver Wendell Holmes infamously declaring:  ""It is better for all the world if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind...Three generations of imbeciles are enough.""",ZenMasterful,2025-04-27T04:27:38,1
