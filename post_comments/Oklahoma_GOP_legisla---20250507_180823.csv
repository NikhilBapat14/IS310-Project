">The court’s majority opinion also ruled that governmental refusal to recognize same-sex marriages denies them numerous benefits of marriage, including the ability to care for children and family members. State bans on same-sex marriages also restricted same-sex couples’ and their families’ ability to move freely around the country, since their rights could vary greatly if they moved to an anti-marriage state, the court ruling said.  >As such, the court ruled that same-sex marriage bans violate both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause by needlessly introducing instability into same-sex relationships for no justifiable or compelling government interest.  And Clarence Thomas and Alito want to go back to this. They've already admitted they want to forcefully overturn Lawrence v Texas, to bring back sodomy laws.     The people who called us ""alarmist"" were simply either cowards who refused to own up to their bigoted hate or cowards who refuse to stand for equality and with their fellow humans.
