"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30.” This is the actual quote. While shelves go empty and the GDP shrinks, he brushes it off like it's a minor parenting lesson.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-30T15:26:13,37

"Be happy that there is less toys for children? No way will he convince his cult to be anti-consumers will he? Add that to job losses, higher prices, with bumbling intelligence matters, you’d think he’s preaching some sort of Soviet era communism.",VladtheInhaler999,2025-04-30T15:28:00,10

You will own nothing and you will be happy... Or be deported. Your choice,krazeone,2025-04-30T15:47:03,9
"If any other President in history had effectively said ""You will have less and it will cost you more due to my trade policies"", there would be universal outrage.  Instead, MAGA (and their Republican enablers) will try and brush inflation under the rug....  even though they were losing their god damn minds about inflation a year ago.",YesterShill,2025-04-30T15:51:43,6
But it will all be worth it when they have even fewer toys that cost even more the next year.,specqq,2025-04-30T15:28:41,6
Good thing for him  kids can’t vote.,Baba_mama2911,2025-04-30T15:30:17,6
Maybe looting will be rampant once there's food scarcity and housing insecurity. Maybe people will come in large numbers to take back all of the trillions stolen by Trump/Musk and their cronies. He's really counting on everybody to stay fat and lazy in front of their TVs and not out on the streets hungry and looking for who is to blame when they've got nothing left to lose.  This Dystopian hellscape will be brought to you by Trump and the MAGA party.,RealGianath,2025-04-30T15:48:54,4

"When are we going to talk about the GOP's war on Christmas? What is Santa supposed to do this year? Leave a note in your stocking saying ""sorry kid but times are tough with these tariffs""?

From 30 down to 2 is a massive decrease. Is he really saying American families are going to have 15X *less* buying power by Christmas?  Holy shit we are fucked,AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-04-30T15:45:31,13
That’s because it doesn’t effect him.  He doesn’t have any small children and is wealthy.  He doesn’t care what happens to regular people.,Irwin-M_Fletcher,2025-04-30T15:47:26,5

"He also gutted the funding for Head Start preschools and child sex abuse investigators, among many other things. It’s a full blown war on children.  As Carlin said “if you’re pre-born you’re fine. If you’re preschool you’re fucked.”",JarJarJarMartin,2025-04-30T15:41:14,4
