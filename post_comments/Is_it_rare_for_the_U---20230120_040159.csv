"The political scientist Lijphart would agree that this strong bicameralism like that of the US is indeed rare and only on par in Argentina, Australia, Germany and Switzerland (2012: 199).   Although many democracies are bicameral, almost all federal countries have it, but it is more split half and half between bicameral and unicameral for unitary states. Federal states are often larger in territorial size, which is especially true of the US, Argentina and Australia, and to a lesser degree perhaps Germany.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2023-01-20T22:32:15,6

"Two major philosophical points in the USA government are ""checks and balances"" and ""separation of powers"". A strong senate and house is one way of enabling them. The whole point to our system is to spread out power.",NoTable2313,2023-01-20T23:02:04,2
"In addition to what other people have said here, there is a power-accountability tradeoff in play as well. The US has an unusually powerful senate, but itâ€™s members are also unusually accountable to voters, representing specific areas (states) and regularly being up for election. In the Canadian Senate, UK House of Lords, and French Senate, members are selected, in one way or another, by other politicians, not direct elections, but generally have less power.",Polyodontus,2023-01-21T06:24:32,2
"The original concept behind bicameralism is that splitting legislative power between two bodies will prevent the legislature from running amok without too severely hamstringing its ability to function effectively. The problem here is that modern political science has found this isn't really a good way to achieve either goal.  Instead, we've come to realize that a legislature running amok isn't a problem as long as you have a robust party structure that closely ties legislative outcomes to public sentiment. By having a majoritarian system that creates this feedback loop effectively, political parties ensure that bills that are very popular mostly get passed without problem, bills that are somewhat popular have a chance to pass, and bills that are unpopular mostly don't pass.   Further, the more we've seen true bipartisan systems, the more we've seen they often do hamstring the government from basic effectiveness. Both the US and Italy are good examples here.  In short, true bicameral systems were once quite popular, only to be exposed as less effective than initially thought at which point many systems pursued reforms to address that. Think of it similar to how basically the entire internet was built on HTML at one point, but then better systems came along and now it's quite uncommon.",mormagils,2023-01-23T09:25:29,1
"To be fair, one of these is not like the other.  The Senate can confirm nominees, judges and treaties without any input from the House at all.  In contrast, while technically the House must introduce spending bills, those bills must pass both houses. As a result, you get a lot of ""this really started in the Senate"" spending bills that only originate in the House in the most technical sense.",ViskerRatio,2023-01-23T12:36:40,2
"You missed a key point here: the concern is not whether something is popular better whether it is wise; the U.S. Senate was created in part to act as a ""cooling saucer"", to paraphrase President Washington.

Spending bills have to originate in the house, but the constitution explicitly gives the senate the power to amend them.

"I didn't miss that at all. My first sentence said this concept in different phrasing. My point is that in the 250ish years since that conceptualized, we've learned that such a sentiment is really more outdated political philosophy than it is a useful mechanic in a modern political system.",mormagils,2023-03-01T09:49:01,1
"I am a bit confused, then.  1. How do you ensure a robust party structure which closely ties legislative outcomes to public sentiment, as you say? 2. If what you say is true, why should any legislature bother having an upper house at all? Without getting into specifics, I can think of numerous examples where the House passed legislature which would have been horrible -- as in ""people will die"" -- if adopted and subsequently blocked by the Senate. Based on what you are saying, it sounds as if we should have adopted those destructive statutory changes because the resultant deaths would have somehow been better.",AlexKingstonsGigolo,2023-03-01T10:19:32,0
"\> How do you ensure a robust party structure which closely ties legislative outcomes to public sentiment, as you say?  Unicameral legislatures that operate on a simple majority, with possibly an upper house serving as some sort of ""rubber stamp"" mechanic whose power is mostly advisory rather than mechanical.  Overall, the more majoritarian your structure, the more legislative outcomes will reflect public sentiment.  \> If what you say is true, why should any legislature bother having an upper house at all?  Well yeah, exactly, that's the point I'm making. Political science suggests that upper houses with legislative powers aren't really all that effective of a mechanic and might just be better off being restructured into something else or having very limited jurisdiction. Look at the UK with its upper house being a sort of weaker supreme court or Germany with its upper house having real authority but only in very specific situations.  \> I can think of numerous examples where the House passed legislature which would have been horrible -- as in ""people will die"" -- if adopted and subsequently blocked by the Senate.  Well lets get into the specifics, shall we? I'd argue that such bills either 1) don't really exist and you're exaggerating the concern or 2) ONLY exist *because* they will get blocked in the Senate. Let me explain the latter case a bit better. One of the reasons the US has such completely insane ideas sometimes is because the insane ideas can't succeed due to checks and balances. This means that when a party that isn't interested in responsible governing gets some power in some parts of the government, but not enough power to actually do anything, then the optimal play is usually to embrace the crazy and shore up the base specifically because they know that the crazy will fail. Put another way, if you took away the Senate veto in those cases, I'd argue that the chances of it having passed the House in the first place decrease drastically.",mormagils,2023-03-01T10:40:18,1

"\> Then, there would be no point to them at all and every nation should ditch them, if you are correct, because how much advise is really needed or would be heeded from groups not already communicating with the lower chamber?  Well, actually, yes, most countries have moved away from a true bicameral model. Especially newer democracies tend to be formed with unicameral legislatures or the very least not quite true bicameral ones. Look at the UK, which had a true bicameral legislature but gradually reformed the upper house into a purely advisory role.   The advisory role can still be very important. The House of Lords does a great job of sending back legislation with important notes about constitutionality, even if it lacks the power to outright prevent legislation from passing that's not up to snuff.   \> You keep pushing that perspective without addressing what to do when that sentiment is wrong, especially fatally so.  That's just one of the bugs of a democracy (which includes republics). The whole point of a representative model is that is dilutes public opinion just enough to perform the effective quality control, while still allowing for a largely majoritarian system. Put another way, please, supply an actual example of a time a system blew itself up with bad ideas that were a result of the unicameral system.  The closest example I can think of is Brexit, but that's not actually an example. Brexit didn't pass as a result of legislative error, but as a result of foolishly calling a referendum in a representative system. A bicameral legislature wouldn't have solved that problem.  \> The problem is, when we look at only one or two examples, we have only anecdotal evidence. Exactly which studies are saying what you say about such structures?  Well, no, actually, we just have a small data set. Anecdotal evidence is related to personal experience. And I'm only bringing up one or two examples because the alternative is to write a dissertation, which this forum isn't really a good setting for. If you want more data points, picking up a decent comparative politics work will explain all of this in much more detail. The one I used was *Principles of Comparative Politics* by Clark, Golder, and Golder. Feel free to read that one or a different one if you'd like, but all of them will advance more or less the same argument I'm making with a more full presentation of evidence.  \> You're speculating as far as I can tell.   No, I'm not. If you look at other political systems that have more majoritarian structures, they don't struggle with extremism the same way despite having a similar amount of extremists participating in the political system. The fact that the systems with the least majoritarian structures suffer from the most extremist outcomes has a direct causal relationship. Lee Drutman explains this in his work *Breaking the Two Party Doom Loop*. (I think that was where I read it, if not it was probably on his twitter page.)  \> Nothing suggests the crazies and/or misinformed wouldn't simply see the lack of senatorial obstruction as an opportunity to push their psychotic/fallacious policies.  Again, that's not correct. Look at how overturning Roe v. Wade had an immediate and swift negative reaction in the 2022 midterms. Already a good portion of the party is accepting that pushing that successful policy was a mistake. There's another good portion of the party rejecting that wisdom, but that faction is largely the one that did the worst in 2022. In fact, if we fixed our structures before 2024 (literally impossible but just for the sake of argument) I'd say that some of the more extremist portions of the GOP would disappear immediately.  Also, for what it's worth, in modern political science a *nation* describes a people, not a political entity. The word you're looking for is *state*, or in cases where the distinction is necessary to indicate they are the same, *nation-state*. In other words, France is a state, the French are a nation, and the French living in France makes it a nation-state.",mormagils,2023-03-01T17:05:41,1

I'm understanding where you stand less now.  > or the very least not quite true bicameral ones  This is even more equivocation. It's really hard to get a picture of what you are trying to say when you seem to have an appreciable degree of inconsistency not only from comment to comment but within the same comment itself. Would you please try being clearer about what you are trying to say? If there is something for me to learn, and I think there is, it would be really helpful if what that something else didn't seem like a moving target.  > can still be very important ... bugs of a democracy  And that advice can still be easily ignored by a passionate and ignorant lower house. So, being an advisor isn't meaningful at all. If 51% of the population want to enact a law ordering the disembowelment and eating of the other 49%, it's at least a little harder in a non-advisory bicameral setting than in an advisory role.  > alternative is to write a dissertation  Or link to studies; it's what people often do, if not typically do.  > picking up a decent comparative politics work  I have literally dozens on my bookshelf which I have consulted over the years and none of them make this case about weak upper houses leading to better outcomes.

There may be an argument to be made about filibuster changes but that is not intrinsic to the strength of the Senate itself; that's solely the result of its rules.  > describes a people, not a political entity  You best take that up with the United Nations first.

"\> Now you're qualifying. It's no longer a message of ""unicameral is better"" but ""something other than full bicameral is better"". I'm understanding where you stand less now.  Well, governmental structures don't exist in a vacuum, and how exactly do we define ""full"" bicameral? Thinking of it like a spectrum is better than considering it like a number line with a series of integer points.   The point is that overall very rigid bicameral structures tend to have worse electoral and legislative outcomes. Look at the US and Italy, two of the most ""full"" bicameral systems, and both of them are *really* struggling with far-right extremism and legislative gridlock. Germany is technically a bicameral system as well, but it's also clearly much more majoritarian and the two houses are clearly not equivalent. Germany struggles with these problems much less.  \> It's really hard to get a picture of what you are trying to say when you seem to have an appreciable degree of inconsistency not only from comment to comment but within the same comment itself.  Well, at no point am I substitute for actual political science. I can give a rough overall picture, but if you're finding there are further questions, then really the solution is to read a book that will answer those questions, not to press me to give enough nuance to fill a poli sci 101 textbook chapter.  \> And that advice can still be easily ignored by a passionate and ignorant lower house.  Well it *can* but it never really quite works out that way because it would be a major hit to the legitimacy of the system. Most democracies are stable enough not to run into this kind of disregard.  \> If 51% of the population want to enact a law ordering the disembowelment and eating of the other 49%, it's at least a little harder in a non-advisory bicameral setting than in an advisory role.  This is a stupid argument. I'm sorry if that's harsh, but it's straight up stupid. It's an incendiary point that political science largely dismisses because it's just a hypothetical that's not real. The whole political system exists to ensure that such a bill wouldn't even get far enough to be written or attract anything close to 51% support, so it's really a moot point. Again, further reading of actual decent sources would help you understand why this is a pretty ""ninth grader thinks he's smarter than NASA"" kind of question.  \> Or link to studies; it's what people often do, if not typically do.  I linked two sources. You must be a fast reader if you're already looking for more.  \> I have literally dozens on my bookshelf which I have consulted over the years and none of them make this case about weak upper houses leading to better outcomes.  What are you reading that has addressed the topic? Do you have any comparative politics book that have addressed political structures? I'm happy to discuss a source and its argument; so far you've presented nothing.  \> How do you measure majoritarianness? Something is either majoritarian or it's not.  Eh...not really. The US is a great example of a system that is in name majoritarian. Our Framers extolled the virtues of majoritarianism. We call ourselves a democracy (or republic, same thing) which is by definition dependent on majoritarianism. And yet we have many individual structures that are anit-majoritarian, and if we're being really technical, and representative democracy at all isn't strictly majoritarian...but that's not really a reasonable way to think about it.  \> Is the weak upper house the only difference between those nations and those with stronger ones?  Of course not. But I'd argue that it's one of the most significant factors.  \> That would be the first I heard of it.

I'll defer to Drutman's solution: primary reform to jungle or top four style primaries, uncapping the House, multimember legislative districts, ending the filibuster, and RCV. All of that except the filibuster is discussed at length in his book. The filibuster wasn't mentioned because the book was published before the most recent abuse of that mechanic, but Drutman has said publicly since on his twitter page that the filibuster needs to go.",mormagils,2023-03-01T22:26:00,1
