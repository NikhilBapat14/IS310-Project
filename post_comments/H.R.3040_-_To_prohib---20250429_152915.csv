"This will probably fly under the radar, sadly.  However, it is a direct attack against one of the few viable options we have to reform the broken two party system.    It is generally understood to put Republicans at a disadvantage since they can not manipulate and disenfranchise voters in the usual way.    This should be fought with as much force as can be mustered.  Besides, as States have the authority to determine how they handle elections this on its face appears to be another constitutional overreach.

"The treasonous Russian-backed, Republican Party crime syndicate should at this point, just dispense altogether with their tissue-thin facade of being anything remotely resembling a legitimate political party and just declare by fiat that any vote for any candidate other than a GOP-approved candidate is immediately determined to be invalid, void - thus not counted - as the fascist-ruled Red states have long been doing with ""provisional ballots"".  Might as well, given the way Republicans have been consistently and ""legally"" rigging and stealing elections - and getting away with it - for decades - on the regular since at least 2000.  That's what Republicans have been desperately - and often criminally - working towards: single-party (theirs) autocratic rule by rich, white men - like it was before the Civil War - the goddamned democracy-hating, thieving fascists.

"Ranked Choice Voting is a mechanism that encourages candidates to pay attention to the interests of ALL of the constituents of a district.    Better attention from Representatives is a widely popular desire among pretty much all Americans.  RCV is working well in Alaska and Maine.  In [Utah](https://www.utah.gov/pmn/files/725501.pdf) there are 20 cities who use RCV in their elections.  RCV encourages more genuine, more attentive representativeness.  And it encourages a pragmatic perspective toward problem solving instead of a partisan one.  RCV also incentivizes nicer, more substance-oriented campaigning.  Hateful, deceptive mudslinging style campaigns do not do as well when RCV is in place, so that kind of bad behavior gets discouraged.  Finally, RCV helps to save money by facilitating fewer election steps and eliminating run-offs.  *Ranked Choice Voting could help to save our Democracy.*  By and large, the only people who hate the idea of RCV are anti-democratic tyrants who have aims to Rule rather than to Represent.  This bill above is essentially pro-tyranny.  It is anti-democratic.  It is un-American.    **[Contact your representatives and urge them NOT to support this bill.](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)** (house.gov)  *Especially* if you are a Republican.  Republicans can and do win RCV elections.  RCV is not an anti-conservative voting reform, it is a pro-people voting reform.  Protect your children's future.  Let them have the same democratic liberties that you yourself have enjoyed.  Do not allow Congress move us down the path to minority party rule.  That is tyranny.  Most Americans want their Representatives to pay more attention to them.    RCV is engineered to solve that problem.  RCV is a pragmatist's voting reform.  It is a people-oriented voting reform.  These are the directions that most regular Americans want our country to move in.  Please, if ever there was a time to rise to the defense of democracy in America, today is that day!    *Now is the hour*.

">As of 04/29/2025 text has not been received for H.R.3040 - To prohibit the use of ranked choice voting in elections for Federal office.  Hard to know what's actually in the bill since there's no text yet.  I'm not ideologically opposed to blocking RCV because it produces very wonky results sometimes in 3-way elections, but it doesn't make much sense to block RCV on those grounds without also blocking first-past-the-post at the same time for similar reasons.  Very likely this bill will allow first-past-the-post but include language to block reasonably good voting systems like approval voting and STAR, and it wouldn't be surprising if they included language blocking any kind of proportional representation system.  (By ""wonky results"" I mean that RCV is non-monotonic.  It's possible for someone to lose an election because too many people put that candidate as their first choice.  That's just weird.  The Republicans that are against RCV don't actually understand that RCV is flawed, they just hate that Democrats have won a couple races thanks to RCV.)  I also suspect that this is unconstitutional, as it's generally up to the states to decide how their elections are run.

">It's just safe to say now that the GOP are proposing bills against many of the things that would keep them from retaining power.  This has been the baseline of politics since 2010, when they took back the House and defined their platform as being Anti Obama, or, as political scientist Jonathan Bernstein termed, they became a post-politics political party. Then, when Romney lost in 2012, there was the infamous ""election autopsy."" It said if you want to win elections again, you need to liberalize and reach out to minority groups. Instead, the GOP went harder right, and the only thing they offered minority groups was a respite from being the minority (appealing to religious minority members, for example). And then, they went all in on voter supression tactics. If you can't win, make the other guy lose more.   It's been safe to say this since at least 2012, arguably 2010, not as a ""it's frustrating that there constantly seem to be party actors interested in this shit"" sentiment but as ""this is the platform, explicit or not, of the GOP.""",Syjefroi,2025-04-29T20:10:59,2

">It gives us all the best chance to find common ground through the election process.  Does it?  One of the weird side effects of how RCV works is that if you have a bunch of candidates and one candidate in particular is the 2nd choice of every single voter, then that candidate (even if they're the best compromise candidate) gets eliminated in the 1st round because no one ranked them in 1st place.  (There's a pretty straightforward fix, which is to eliminate candidates on the basis of ""worst Borda count"" rather than ""fewest 1st place votes"".  There's a name for that system, but I can never remember what it is.)  I'd much rather we used approval voting for a number of reasons.  For some reason people don't like being forced to vote yes or no on each candidate, so if we want a score-based ballot then STAR is pretty reasonable.",elihu,2025-04-29T22:25:04,3

"When you vote you write down your preferences so if your first choice doesn’t win your vote transfers to your second choice and so on.   There are pizza party explanations on youtube. Briefly though, it means if say 32% of people at the party love hawaiian pizza and put that as their first choice but the other 68% put various different pizzas  as their first choice the least popular choice (anchovy and vegemite) gets kicked out at the end of the first round and votes of people who voted for it are looked at and their next choices are allocated to those pizza options. If no pizza choice has reached 50% then it goes to round 3 etc. Eventually the winner is meat lovers at 52% because most people friggin hate pineapple on pizza. With ranked choice voting you don’t end up with a pizza most people seriously hate.   In an election it has the added advantage that if a party or person would like the supporters of a different party or person to put them as their second choice then they tend to be more willing to move towards a position that’s somewhat attractive to that other party or person. So if I’m running as a “right-wing dickhead” I might be friendly with the “serious nutjobs” party in hopes that their supporters will put my party in second place. Or if I’m Democrat and the Greens have a decent number of people likely to vote Green in #1 I might be sure to play up my green policies and ask the head of the Greens to ask their voters to put my party second. It’s just a suggestion but quite a lot of people take a “how to vote” flyer from their preferred party for how they would ideally like your preferences to go if the Greens don’t get in.",Limberine,2025-04-29T19:05:09,2

If a 3rd party ran on a platform of things that the American majority prefer over either Dems or Republicans, it could be a landslide victory. MOST Americans want   \- universal healthcare   \- tuition free college   \- living wages   \- paid family and maternity leave   \- affordable housing   \- infrastructure investment   \- climate action   \- social security expansion   \- taxing corporations and wealthy people more   \- expanded veterans benefits   \- freezing military budget increases   \- less overseas military presence   \- less waste to defense contractors  And even if a 3rd party couldn't mobilize to a 2028 victory, in an RCV context it wouldn't hinder the dems.

"They've already been doing this at the state level. They pushed a dumbass amendment to the state constitution in Missouri last year to ban ranked-choice voting and it passed with overwhelming support.  How did it pass with so much support? Because the ballot language was intentionally misleading. It started off with ballot candy — prohibiting illegal immigrants from voting in state elections, which is already the law — and it ended with confusing language that incorrectly described ranked-choice voting as providing ""multiple votes."" It didn't use the wording ""ranked-choice voting"" anywhere in the amendment.  So, it essentially asked ""Do you want to ban illegal immigrants from voting and also make it illegal to allow people to have multiple votes?"" and Missourians, being the idiots they are, overwhelmingly supported it at the polls.  Missourians also voted to re-legalize gerrymandering a few years ago too. I hate this state.",KarmaticArmageddon,2025-04-29T23:08:49,1

They actually don't. They certify the elections but they have no say over how the elections are administered in each state and the 10th amendment says this bill is unconstitutional. That being said the 12th amendment would need to be changed or removed for ranked choice voting to work in the United States. Otherwise Congress gets to choose the president.  Because of the electoral college and majority rules anyone voted for would still need at least 270 electoral votes to win the election or Congress gets to choose the next president and I can assure you I don't want that happening. So ranked choice is a great option but because of the other systems in place it would be pointless to implement it without removing the electoral college portion of presidential elections.

"If one person is the majority 1st place preference, they do in fact win.  However, there are some situations where you have a competitive 3-way race with no 1st place majority in the first round where a candidate would have won if only some voters hadn't ranked them so highly.  Wikipedia has an example.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative\_responsiveness#Runoff\_voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_responsiveness#Runoff_voting)",elihu,2025-04-30T05:14:11,1
"Typically when people say ranked choice, they're referring to Instant Runoff Voting. In that system, who ever has the least number of #1 votes gets eliminated after the first round, but that candidate may have gotten a high percentage of 2nd votes and been more acceptable to voters overall. In other words, instant runoff fails to elect consensus candidates.  In an election with three colors - Red, Blue, and Purple: First round of IRV:  - Red: 40% first-choice votes - Blue: 35% first-choice votes - Purple: 25% first-choice votes (eliminated)  But when we look at everyone's complete rankings:  - Red voters: 1. Red, 2. Purple, 3. Blue - Blue voters: 1. Blue, 2. Purple, 3. Red - Purple voters: 1. Purple, 2. Red, 3. Blue  Purple gets eliminated even though they were more broadly acceptable having something like 65% of people ranking them 1 or 2.   For single seats, there's approval voting where you just vote yes/no on all the candidates and the one with the most yeses wins. This is kinda how you'd decide where to go to dinner with a group of friends.   - Who's ok with Meat Mountain? 2 out of 4  - Who's ok with Salad City? 1 out of 4  - Who's ok with Burger Bureau? 3 out of 4  Ok, we're going to Burger Bureau  For legislative elections, the most important principle for breaking the 2 party stronghold is *proportionality*, in other words party x gets y% of votes, then they get y% of seats.   One way to do that is Single Transferrable Vote, used in Australia. This one does involve ranking candidates and there is a complicated formula for determining winners. One downside is that you can end up with a very long list of candidates.   Another way is Mixed Member Proportional, used in Germany and New Zealand. You vote for a candidate for your district, and also for the party you want to rule. After the district candidates are seated, members are seated from a party list so that the overall makeup is close to the party vote percentage. Using the color election above in a legislature with 100 seats, Red gets 40 seats, Blue gets 35 seats, and Purple gets 25 seats. No party has an outright majority so they will have to find common ground an form a coalition to accomplish their legislative goals.     CGP Grey has a few videos on each of these that are pretty informative. You can also search for ""Mixed Member Proportional in New Zealand"" on youtube for an explanation from the NZ government.",SurgicalClarity,2025-04-30T07:36:51,2

They put a book in front of them and tell them to figure it out themselves. It doesn't work. Some places are going back to teaching phonetics and are seeing DOUBLE the literacy rates. A huge success.

"I also laugh when Conservatives complain about the wording of math problems. Like word problems have a purpose. It's to get you to think about a problem and problem solve. You could just ask 10x10=? on a test and if someone has memorized their 10s times table then they just write 100. The problem one is that's how a lot of the older generation was taught, memorizing things. That's why they didn't like the new style of curriculum being taught to their kids or grandkids, because it was less about getting the answer and more about how you got the answer. Memorizing 10x10=100 is easy. Understanding that 10x10 means 10 groups of 10 objects and adding them all together builds better foundation for further endeavors into math. The other problem is the words used in the problem are basically pointless. Doesn't matter if I say Tim or Tommy or Annie or that Annie and Sue are mom's together. The ""scene"" that the word problem describes isn't important. What's important is whether kids can recognize ""oh there's two people I'm working with, now what do I need to figure out next.""

"We found that frontal lobe lesion patients reported more conservative (or less liberal) political orientation than patients with damage to their anterior temporal lobe and healthy control participants with no history of brain damage. ATL lesion patients were as liberal as healthy control participants. These findings were robust to various model specifications, including those that adjusted for demographic, mood and affect-related variables. Moreover, the extent of damage in the dlPFC was positively associated with self-reported conservatism, whereas the extent of damage in the amygdala was not associated with ideology. These results were not attributable to ideological extremity, which was unrelated to brain damage.  The results of our study suggest that the prefrontal cortex may be a region that is integral to the expression of liberal political attitudes, insofar as damage to this brain region was associated with a more conservative orientation. The results are also suggestive of the possibility that the amygdala is an important structure for the development of conservative attitudes, given that ATL lesion patients were less conservative than frontal lobe lesion patients. This would be consistent with prior work linking greater amygdala volume to conservatism [17] and system justification [47]. At the same time, ATL lesion patients were no more liberal than healthy control participants, and the degree of amygdala damage was not associated with ideology, so, at least in this context, it appears that the amygdala per se is not a necessary structure for conservatism. We hope that future work will be able to assess causal pathways more directly, perhaps by obtaining information about political attitudes before and after a planned surgical resection of brain tissue.  Based on research linking (a) political liberalism to cognitive flexibility and control and (b) executive functioning to frontal lobe activity, we explored the possibility that patients with frontal lobe lesions were more conservative owing in part to diminished executive functioning. However, this possibility was not borne out in this study. We examined performance on three established tests of executive function; the differences we observed were in the expected direction, but they were not statistically significant, possibly because our sample was too small to provide sufficient statistical power. It is possible that specific cognition type could be useful to consider. For instance, it may be that social or identity-related cognitive functions are especially pertinent when it comes to linking frontal cortex function to political ideology (see [10]). Future research would do well to investigate these possibilities in larger samples, possibly by combining several small samples of patients with different types of lesions.  Some have argued that the study of political ideology requires the measurement of multiple dimensions, such as social and economic attitudes ([60]; but see [77]). We had no specific predictions regarding social versus economic dimensions of ideology (as opposed to overall liberalism–conservatism), but we did administer individual items to measure them separately. We found no evidence that brain lesions were differentially linked to social versus economic attitudes, nor to ideological extremity on any of these dimensions. Nevertheless, future research based on larger (and more diverse) samples would do well to explore these possibilities.  In conclusion, we have undertaken a neuropsychological investigation of political orientation by focusing on patients with different brain lesions. Our findings speak to the question of whether certain brain regions are necessary for the development of specific political beliefs, opinions and values. It may be worth noting that by exploring brain lesions we are not in any way suggesting that holding liberal or conservative attitudes is reflective of neural deficits or damage. Rather, the lesion method illuminates which neuroanatomical regions—and the cognitive functions related to them—may be necessary for understanding the development of political ideology. It is also important to keep in mind that studies of brain structure, including lesion studies, do not rule out effects of neural reorganization and malleability [78]. Accordingly, we strongly caution against deterministic or essentialized interpretations of our research (see [79]). Moreover, we theorize that the relationship between neurobiology and ideology is dynamic and reciprocal (see [5]), bearing in mind Nudo's [78, p. 1] observation that ‘behavioural experience is the most potent modulator of brain plasticity'. Along these lines, we look forward to future research that specifies the ways in which ideological experiences may shape the structures and functions of the human brain.      https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0137#:~:text=We%20found%20that%20frontal%20lobe,no%20history%20of%20brain%20damage",anExcuseForASnooze,2025-04-30T02:37:31,3

Meanwhile moderate actual libertarians like myself who believed in things like reducing the size of the military, flat tax rates with no loooholes so everyone, especially the rich, pay their fair share, protecting 2A, really protecting 1A, pro abortion, legalize marijuana, and strictly enforced separation of church and state…   well we just got pushed out and libertarians are pretty much all crazies now.

"shall be prescribed in the legislature thereof, meaning the state legislative branch is making the rules and deciding. They can alter it but it would be a fight that some states, like Maine, are willing to fight and can show that it did nothing to hinder their ability to provide results in a timely manner.  The problem is that unless you reform more of the system it doesn't really matter. The presidential elections can't risk ranked choice with the electoral college in place or else Congress gets to decide. I think Maine will have an easy enough argument to fight this if it ever goes beyond being proposed. There isn't even text of the bill yet so I would hesitate to get too worried about it until it actually gets to the house floor for a vote, and then it still has to go to the Senate.

I am not against ranked choice I think it is a great system it just can't feasible work for a presidential election as our system is made up right now. Now it can work for senate and congressional races though and if enough states adopted it for everything but it could actually lead to a change in the system because enough third-party candidates would be in place to start enacting real change.",cirignanon,2025-04-29T17:52:50,18

"Sure they can make some laws but those laws would be contested by the states who currently use Ranked choice voting and can show that this law is an overreach of the federal government based on the 10th amendment.  That and ranked choice will not work for presidential elections in the way people want it to because of how the electoral college works. You have to have a majority to be declared the winner and if just enough states have a third-party candidate pull those votes away it would lead to Congress declaring the election for whomever they choose. It worked in Maine because the first round ended with a majority for both districts and didn't lead to the runoff tabulation. That use case though doesn't prove that it can work only that it didn't cause a problem.  Let's say for example every state had allowed ranked-choice this time around but everything else was the same. The Congress that would have certified the election would have been this current Senate with a Trump-friendly majority. So we are back to where we started.  Lastly this is just a proposed bill that doesn't even have the language of the bill posted yet. I would not worry about it until it gets farther through committee. A lot of bills get proposed in a year and not that many actually make it. Also depending on the committee if any members are from ranked choice states they might try to just kill it before it can make it to the floor, even Republicans can benefit from ranked choice and if their state has approved it they may listen. Really though without major overhauls of the system ranked choice is only going to get the country so far. More states need to adopt it and certain things need to be abolished (the electoral college) before it will have any real lasting effect on the politics of the United States.

Again, I'm all for universal healthcare but it isn't possible with the way Americans vote so I'm super supportive of the ACA which is the next best thing. If all liberals acted like you, we'd have nothing because republicans would have a supermajority.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-01T14:43:40,1
"You’re describing all of the things Dems have to overcome to win elections as if that’s news to me. It isnt.  That doesn’t mean that more people didn’t vote for Trump and the Republicans to control the government. Congratulations. You’ve seen why the Dems are already at a disadvantage.  Higher turnout helps win elections, but progressives don’t drive high turnout. That’s been their problem for decades. They don’t have high turnout and don’t have high voter engagement.  In a perfect election system with no monied interests and no dirty GOP tactics, maybe progressives would do better (and that’s a big maybe). But that isn’t the country we’ve ever lived in.  In the country we do live in, progressives lose elections. They did the worst out of all groups in the last election.  Overcoming the Republican shit heel policies that depress turnout is the reality that we have to deal with. Progressives haven’t found a way to do that, or deal with superpacs/billionaires influencing elections. More moderate dems do win under these conditions. That’s the cold hard reality",mightcommentsometime,2025-04-30T04:46:57,0
How can there be this busy market of textbook producers competing to make textbooks targeted to your specifications and also only one set of textbooks made to the Texas specification that the rest of the country is stuck with?,fennis_dembo_taken,2025-04-30T20:45:32,1
"You didn’t read the newspapers in North Carolina during 2008/2009/2010  It was obvious “if republicans win they will redraw districts so they will never lose an election for 100 years”   And like usual, Dems don’t do shit",FlimsyMo,2025-05-01T05:10:24,1
"Look around,  we live in a republican hellscape.   When democrats get into power they pass Republican agendas.   You are a staunch supporter of “republican lite” which is what Americas “corporate democrats” are.  Republicans don’t settle for anything but the extremes and that causes the “smart democrats “ to settle for the middle ground. Well the middle ground is a republican idea due to the shift of overtones window",FlimsyMo,2025-05-01T14:52:25,1
"IIRC a lot of smaller states don't do their own vetting but rely on what the big states say.  I'm only repeating something I saw years 9decades) ago, although it hasn't changed much.  But it's cheaper and simpler to win the Texas approval than to make multiple versions.",GrumpyCloud93,2025-05-01T08:47:04,1
