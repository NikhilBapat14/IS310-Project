"As much as I hate Trump and everything he is doing to our country, I don't hate this pick. I read her book. I'm trying to figure out what policy changes she supports that her critics would disagree with?  I feel that the status quo is not working - big pharma and big food corporations have bought everyone - the media, healthcare organizations, universities, political campaigns.   Our kids are served garbage at school. We could help childhood obesity like Japan does, but we choose not to.   Europe, and even China in some cases, have more strict guidelines on what chemicals can be put into our food.   We are thrown drug after drug (and of course they absolutey have thier place and save lives) but overall we are not getting healthier. Life expectancy is going down.   I might give her some side eye for a few things, I am pro vax, but overall she is in support of metabolic health - simple, basic things like eating healthy and exercising, and questioning what is obviously not working in the medical establishment.    I see she didn't finish her residency, but is that qualification necessarily to see all the disfunction in healthcare?

But again, I‚Äôd be willing to give her a benefit of a doubt if she actually uses her position to benefit Americans and not her own pocketbook. That remains to be seen:  Review of her book except below:  ‚ÄúBut despite all her talk of conflicts of interest being a problem in healthcare research, she doesn't directly disclose her own: that she owns a company that profits extensively off the claims she's making in the book (like everyone should use a continuous glucose monitor because blood tests are insufficient, and she happens to have a company that makes/sells monitors, prescriptions for monitors, and an app subscription to track your data). Nor does she disclose that her brother/co-author has a healthcare company (he's an MBA, not a clinician) that also profits from the advice and recommendations in the book (and that she's an investor in his company), or that Mark Hyman, MD is the medical advisor for her brother's company and he is quoted extensively throughout her book to support her statements (and he also provided an endorsement/quote for her book separately). Or that the company she recommends readers order their own blood work from is Mark Hyman's new medical startup (and costs about 100x more than ordering your own blood work directly from a lab like Labcorp or Marek would). And after looking on her website, she is an investor in that medical startup (which I don't think she disclosed in the book itself, but I could have missed it). She also promotes basil seeds frequently throughout the book (and she happens to be an investor in a basil seed company that sells them for like $20 per bag, compared to the $2 they cost at an Indian grocer, if you happen to have one nearby). Notice a trend? ""Here's a bunch of advice about what you should do, and if you need help, here are places you can go to get an app/device/nutrition/food delivery, and I happen to be an investor in each of these companies that sell these things way over market value!""‚Äù",snarky_marmot,2025-05-08T13:04:17,4

‚ÄúI bet that one vaccine probably isn‚Äôt causing autism‚Äù.  And no one has done ANY compounding studies on the 72+ vaccines that are current on the schedule (this was 12 like 10 years ago). Sounds like she is just skeptical? Which sounds logical?,Shoddy-Internet9177,2025-05-08T13:02:50,-1

"Tennisgod, you have a point. I do not see medical doctors as the answer to all of our health problems. I think we may need to start thinking outside of the box concerning our health and a lot of other societal issues.  just to clarify, I hate trumpists and that solution to the issues with the system is to destroy it. But that does not mean that I stand for the ""status quo"". So maybe she should give her a chance.",Dazzling_Computer476,2025-05-08T08:54:39,1
"she never finished her residency therefore she was never a practicing surgeon. she was a practicing surgeon resident.   all that aside, she did 5 years of ENT surgery residency to‚Ä¶.. start a glucose monitoring business. what about ENT surgery makes her an expert in metabolic health? she‚Äôs a quack.",tin-f0il-man,2025-05-08T14:12:53,2

"Are you talking about people like RFK? I'm not so sure he's any less of an expert than the prior guy. Sure some of Trump's picks haven't been cream of the crop. It doesn't mean this doctor is somehow a terrible choice.   Have you ever listed to a podcast with Dr. Means? Because it's pretty obvious she is just trying to help people get their life on track.  Her book Good Energy's hypothesis is that metabolic dysfunction is the foundational component of American disease burden. Similar to how when somebody gets diabetes they become super vulnerable to a million other conditions. Is it so far fetched that a dysfunctional metabolism could also be the culprit in our disease epidemic? We know obesogens cause metabolic dysfunction. We know obesity is a consequences of metabolic dysfunction.   Everybody likes to focus on the chemicals in our food but they are likely not the culprit. The reason is Japan uses more processed food than we do. Europe while eating a fresher diet, has a higher cancer burden than America does. So something is off.",pickledplumber,2025-05-07T18:09:28,1
"maybe bc people make baseless claims about medicine when they do not work or have any experience on how the health care system works.   this person just said a person with a relevant associates degree can be more up to date than an MD. the baseline level of knowledge going through medical school and passing steps 1-3 alone means a physician in a different area of speciality has a better understanding than that person. it‚Äôs funny, the person says you don‚Äôt ask your ophthalmologist about managing DM, but the ophthalmologist actually has to have a good idea about DM considering diabetic retinopathy is one of the things they see the most.   no, a person without any medical degree does not know more just bc they did some studying / work in a specialist office as an MA. i‚Äôm not saying a cardiologist is an expert in dermatology, but the foundation in medicine is much higher than you think. people should not be so arrogant to think they know much more than a doctor as we don‚Äôt project that we know more about engineering, accounting, etc",bigstepper416,2025-05-08T14:50:37,0

"You sound like you have some sort of complex about feelings of inferiority.  You have the degree so you must be smarter than somebody without that degree.  Ironically, it's a very naive take to assume the only legitimate knowledge you can gain about health is in a medical school classroom or in a few weeks of rotations.  Why do you think general practitioners and even specialists, especially psychiatrists, will send their patients to therapists without medical degrees?  It's because people can learn very specific information and be knowledgeable about that while most doctors have to have extremely broadbased knowledge, even after they begin specializing.  As part of my example you ignored, how long did you study nail health in medical school?  Which USMLE exam did you have to answer about cuticle care and breakage caused by acrylics?  When did you learn about tattoo and piercing aftercare steps?  On which rotation did you focus on the options for reducing hyperpigmentation and fine lines using non-invasive methods?  Nobody is saying doctors aren't smart enough to learn those or dozens of other topics.  It's just that most doctors simply haven't studied them yet, nor will they likely ever.  It's a stupid reason to discount the knowledge gained by people who have devoted decades to these niche topics.    Like, congrats, ten years ago you memorized everything about kidneys and you can still even identify the thalamus on a fuzzy black and white cross section of the brain today within three tries.  But the letters MD or DO after your name don't mean you're the ONLY person that can learn about health related topics in depth.",boldandbratsche,2025-05-08T15:55:39,1

"If the combination of multiple treatments that occur together causes an effect, the effect will be visible when examined individually, as individuals that receive one treatment likely also receive the other treatments. The control group likely does not receive other treatments.  You don‚Äôt need to do a study like this since it would appear in a study of individual vaccines.
