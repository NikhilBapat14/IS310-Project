"I mean, this isn't really surprising. It was love at first sight back. Trump, a young minted wrinkly orange underdog trying to make it to the top. Fox a conservative news channel feeling forgotten by a world moving on.  These two strangers, man and news station, found something special in eachother. Sure, the relationship has had a few rough patches; What with trump going on entire rants while Fox News sat in awkward silence. But, here they are years later, still just as in love with eachother as the day they met.  To outsiders, it's a vomit inducing site that makes their eyes bleed; To them it's true love.",Fossils222,2025-05-10T07:50:08,13

We should refer to it as the Fox administration to screw with Trump. You know how he also has to have his name out there. This would drive him up the wall.,SpudgeBoy,2025-05-10T09:57:28,2
Someone needs to slowly explain to Trump that just putting people in government he sees on TV doesn’t make the lies they say come true.,poontong,2025-05-10T10:14:29,1
