My experience with the Democratic Party is the opposite.  A lot of arguing and hemming and hawing over any sort of differences no matter how small followed by agitation and teeth gnashing over the agreed upon decision finally reached.,federalist66,2024-08-07T15:56:59,14
"It’s not surprising that everyone, including democrats, feels like a challenge to their political ideas might just be a prelude to an all out attack. We’re all hyperaware that politics has gotten very dirty, with ‘plants’ sent to committees, rallies and protests for the goal of disruption. Paid agents, bot armies, invested grifters make it very hard to trust anyone’s intentions. That said, if your ideology isnt aligning with democrats consistently, perhaps you are not actually a democrat. You wouldnt be the first independent in the world  disillusioned by a major party.",Ezzmon,2024-08-07T16:02:34,3
"I argue with Democrats and leftist types constantly and vote Democrat like every time just like them. If anything I have more arguments with people on ""my side"" than any other group because I interact with them more.   Here is the thing you have to understand. If you take an unpopular opinion within your own group people will argue with you. People are not guaranteed to be polite.   With that being said when I openly support Democrats in front of conservatives they get very frustrated and also are not polite. It pops their bubble. If you are going to express views that go against the norm of whatever group you are speaking them to you are going to get conflict   This is true outside of politics too. It's just a fact of life. Many people avoid these interactions because they can be unpleasant.",thebigmanhastherock,2024-08-07T16:35:17,3
I feel like the “far left” are the only people that DO question the party.   Outside of Biden’s age what do you want people to push back against?,Hotspur1958,2024-08-07T17:37:07,1
"It has nothing to do with Democrats, that's why you will find it on both sides, and on all sides of everything that has sides; of course we can't say it happens equally on all sides, but we'll not settle the debate on who has it more.  It has everything to do with human beings. Not many are good with thinking, much less independently. And not many understand the concepts of fairness, honesty etc.  So give any group of people anything to follow religiously, and they will exhibit the same characteristics. EVEN IN ACADEMIA. There are many in academia who treat their fields of study and authors like ""sides to be on"" and even in the very field that's all about application of intellect dispassionatelly, you will find the same characteristics you have described; an aversion to questioning the status quo or what is popular on their side of things, hostility towards those who do etc.  So again, you will find same in anything that has ""sides.""  The solution is two fold:  1. Create systems that prevent and/or make useless the formation of sides/teams/camps etc. and forces people to be independent (yes it's possible); fix anything that can breed identify politics, which is what it is, and happens naturally in people everywhere (identity politics as properly described in ""The Tragedy Called Democracy in the 21st Century"" though)  2. A kind of education (which we currently don't have) that teaches and trains people on logic, fairness, honesty etc. (or at least attempts to).",fletcher-g,2024-08-08T05:06:12,1
"Throughout my political journey, I feel it comes down to lack of open-mindedness.   I grew up with my parents voting for Republicans. They own a small business to this day and didn't agree with the financial policies of the Democrats. At first, I followed my parents lead and voted Republican because I didn't know a thing about policy, the candidates, how the government worked nor did I have real life experience at 18 (2012).  Around 2015 and leading up to the 2016 election I started getting into politics more, listening to NPR and getting my feet wet and I related more to the Democratic policies. I have vivid memories of my dad watching Fox, listening to Tucker Carlson and all I did was argue how moronic he was for watching Fox. I couldn't stand Tucker Carlson. But to my disservice, I wasn't even open-minded to listening or researching what they were saying to form educated opinions.  During this time (I was a huge Bernie fan, car magnet and all), my best friend was extremely pro Trump. We both spoke about politics often, agreed on few topics, disagreed on others and created our own ""ideal scenarios"" for certain topics like taxes. To this day, her and I are still best friends and discuss more politics than ever.  After Trump's election in 2016, I couldn't handle listening to politics. I stopped listening to NPR, news channels, reading anything about Trump. It was extremely overwhelming. At some point, things shifted for me... I can't pinpoint exactly when but I can definitely say 2020 changed everything for me.  I'm writing to you with majority of ""Republican"" views and some ""Independent"" views. For the last 12 years, I've been on both sides of the argument. Even today, I still believe in core Democratic values. I have immediate family and friend that completely disagrees with me to this day. Some who refuse to talk to me just because of political differences... But as a registered Republican with more life experience under my belt, I'm not naive to the harsh realities of how our government organizations are run.  Long story short, *my personal experience* with today's Democrats is that 1) they don't believe their mind/perspective can be changed, 2) they focus on emotion more than facts, 3) they take things personally rather than thinking critically. These are all characteristics that tie into you question as to why Democrats don't seem to question the status quo and their own policies; however, I understand that this can also be reflection of broader societal issues rather than an intrinsic flaw within the party.  Don't lose hope if you're trying to bring forth change or conversation. Independent thinkers like yourself are what the world needs more of.",pware2,2024-08-09T11:27:39,1
"I hope you’ll still vote blue this year. I find a two party system incredibly frustrating, and I am sure many others do as well. But I’ll take it over a one-party system.",Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:05:20,1
"I am always curious about women who say they ""would never vote for Trump."" A vote for Kamala was a vote for 4 more years.  Trump can be obnoxious, stubborn, rude, disgusting.   But this is about his policies and hers (if she has any.) Her policies continue to convice people they are victims. The Dems will not be happy until everyone is a victim. Then they will offer programs for the ""victims."" She was going to give $20,000 to black men who wanted to start a business. The ""anti-racist"" making one of the most racist proposals of all time. What about black women, what about white people, asians, etc? And after all her insincere bluster about how much she cares for people, she doesn't have any caring to give. It is not in the woman.   I think we dodged a huge bullet but understand why Trump creates hate. A lot of the hate was created by the media, constantly repeating lies about him. There are many examples. But to the last days of the campaign, Kamala and Biden and every liberal talking head claimed Trump said he was going to be a dictator. He of course, never said that.  He said he would be for one day. To rebuild the wall, and drill for oil.  People are not as stupid as they think.  Maybe we will have a better candidate next time and you can dare to vote outside the family.",NoDig3744,2024-11-11T20:49:31,1

"It seems that there are a lot of moderates and liberals who cannot conceive of criticism of the Democrats coming from the left. It's as if they believe that the Democratic Party covers all citizens to the left of center. And it gives them a way to dismiss any criticism they don't like, by claiming you're ""actually"" a Trump supporter or a Russian troll.  Right-wingers and left-wingers both dislike the Democratic Party, but they dislike different things about them and for different reasons.",[deleted],2024-08-07T17:21:18,1
This is what I notice too. I’m not sure if OP’s frustration is really about the party. Maybe it’s more about the fact we’re stuck with a two-party system.,Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:05:55,2
I feel like people far to the left and toward the middle question things. It’s just that we all know we’re stuck with a two-party system. So we have to keep backing the party.,Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:07:53,1

Most really left ppl don’t even see how they are doing exactly what they accuse all the right leaning ppl of,Fayelynne,2024-11-15T05:11:15,1
Ya what's interesting about people in the middle is idk what their endgame is. There is also such a disparity between the party platforms these days that idk how someone ends up in the middle in the first place. But I do know if they wanted to move on from the two party system staying in the middle wont fix that. Either side with the libertarians and hope the free market can fix everything or try to fix crony capitalism from the top down.,Hotspur1958,2024-08-09T22:35:44,1
