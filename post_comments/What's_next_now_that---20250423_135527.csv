That is a lie. His minions are still working there. He is doing that to make his stocks gone up. It is like Putin is not in the US but Trump is here.,kupomu27,2025-04-23T13:58:23,20
This is a ruse. He is still in charge. He is just too embarassing to keep in the limelight. They've already got all the data they need.,parasyte_steve,2025-04-23T13:59:54,14
The Tesla brand continues to crater as the realization settles in that 'more Musk' is not a remedy for dropping sales.,Tokie-Dokie,2025-04-23T13:58:36,9
"Stepping back is not stepping down, he will just stop talking in the public, that is all. His minions will keep butchering the government and ruining lives; meanwhile, Musk will keep harvesting whatever data he wants for himself and whomever wants to buy data from him.

Wait? People all over the country are leaving bird seed on teslas? So it attracts a bunch of shitting birds? That’s crazy.,f1rstg1raffe,2025-04-23T14:23:44,3
Like everyone else posted and apparently it needs to be shouted from the rooftops- HE IS NOT STEPPING BACK.  They need to stop with this bullshit coverage.,GuyMakesDrawings,2025-04-23T14:30:06,3
He'll just be a dark shadow pulling the same levers but without the grandiose white house chest thumping and press attention. Their plans may get even more sinister since he won't be there to openly take the blame.,Blue_Lake_3386,2025-04-23T14:55:08,3

"Well I'm not going to stop loudly hating Elon Musk, that's for damn sure.  Step back and keep stepping back until you fall into traffic, filth.",panteleimon_the_odd,2025-04-23T15:23:14,1
"***From Business Insider's Grace Eliza Goodwin and John L. Dorman***:      [Elon Musk](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk) may be winding down his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, but that doesn't mean the cost-cutting task force will be ending any time soon.  Musk, the chief executive of both Tesla and SpaceX, announced on Tuesday that he'd be reducing his presence at the [White House DOGE office](https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-department-of-government-efficiency) down to one or two days a week so he can focus more of his time on Tesla — which during the first quarter of 2025 saw its [earnings](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-earnings-call-report-tsla-stock-live-updates-2025-4) plunge 71% year over year.  In the three months since [President Donald Trump](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump) established the initiative, unofficially led by Musk, it has worked quickly to reduce government spending and gut the federal workforce.  In its attempt to fulfill its stated purpose of rooting out fraud, waste, and abuse, DOGE has targeted nearly every federal agency.  But DOGE's work is far from over, and in some ways, it's still just getting started.

Exactly. He’s not stepping back. It was just something he *halfway* said during the earnings call to try to assuage the investors. He’s not letting go.,transcriptoin_error,2025-04-23T14:06:35,3
Yep. Probably already sold to Russia.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-23T14:04:54,2
That’s why we shouldn’t just forget about him. ,Throb_Zomby,2025-04-23T17:43:13,1
