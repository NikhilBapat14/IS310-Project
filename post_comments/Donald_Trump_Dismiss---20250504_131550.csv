"Gas prices are down? No they aren't. I live in Texas where some of the cheapest gas prices actually are. It is NOT gone to under $2 since he has been in office. Period. It hit lower numbers under Biden then it has under Dump. I am so sick of his endless lies and the people who believe them. While gas prices haven't surged, they aren't lower and they would have to be FAR lower to make up for the rising price of everything else.  But yeah, his brainwashed sheeple continue to believe the idiocy he spouts, even though the evidence of the lies is right in front of their eyes.  >""Energy is 60 percent of the costs.""  60% of WHAT costs? Life costs? Another blatant lie. I pay about $80 a month on gas for my car. On the WORST month of summer (in Texas) I pay about $400 for my utility bill and $35 for gas. That equals $515 a month for ""energy"" costs. That is .60% of $859 (rounded up the pennies). So according to his math, the rest of my expenses are only $344. Yeah, they aren't. You could multiply that $344 by 10 and it still wouldn't be my monthly expenses.  The idiocy is mind blowing.
