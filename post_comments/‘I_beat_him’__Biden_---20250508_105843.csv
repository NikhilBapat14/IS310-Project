Ultimately, however, Biden shouldn't have run in the first place, and part of his platform in the 2020 election was that he would be a transitional President, meaning he wasn't going for two terms. The Democrat party should have been preparing potential replacements from the beginning of his term. It is their catastrophic failure to do this that led to the emergency crisis that replaced Biden with Harris on a whim, and if you believe that nothing fucky happened with the election then ultimately this underhanded swap to Harris without the normal primary selection process (that should have happened with aforementioned potentials) confused the electorate with the sudden change.

As of now, the Democrats could at least gum up the works but they do worse than nothing, some of them are outright supporting a lot of it. Like voting in Trump's appointees and not vetoing his executive orders despite having the ability to at least slow that crap down.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-08T15:47:04,1
You didn't answer my question at all. Unsurprising. You're ready to diagnose someone with something you know nothing about. Now that's frightening,PropofolMargarita,2025-05-09T13:03:13,1

"And Trump was a raving psychotic lunatic both on the debate and off it. What's your point?          To anyone with any sense whatsoever Trump clearly lost his debate with Trump. The right wing media wouldn't shut up about Biden's performance at the debate for weeks while completely ignoring or at best massively sanewashing Trump's performance. Joe sounded a little tired and gained momentum throughout the debate.      Biden on his worst day could crush Trump on his best, no contest. If the Democrats hadn't freaked out and kicked Biden off, we'd have him as president right now.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-09T10:50:55,1
"And this is where I think the ""both sides are the same"" trolls end up falling on their faces. It's like saying the person who didn't lock the door is just as responsible for a murder as the guy who walked through the door and pulled the trigger. Not to mention that ""both sides"" narratives like this inherently have to ignore a whole lot of legislation and attempts to stop what's going on, and requires ignorance of the filibuster, majorities needed, etc.",scotcetera,2025-05-08T16:25:37,1
Dude are you forgetting fucking history? Blaming Fox News for AN ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ASKING HIM TO STEP DOWN ?     Is this Joe Bidens burner? Just admit he clowned himself.,jotsea2,2025-05-09T10:54:17,0
"More like you sat there while the baby grabbed a box of matches and set fires, and instead of taking the matches away so the baby stops setting fires, the lazy, worthless adult in the room just tries to put out the fires every so often, failing to notice the fire is spreading.  The Republicans are the baby and the Democrats are the lazy worthless adult in the room. The Democrats are at least as responsible as the Republicans are for this, if not more. It turns out, if you let a political party do whatever the hell they want without suffering consequences, they're going to abuse their power for all their worth. You know, like *what our country was founded to stop.*  The both sides idea comes from the fact that one side is openly corrupt and the other side just sits on their asses and does nothing to stop the other side.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-08T18:15:55,1
"Yeah, I do blame Fox News, and all the other right wing media, for the fact that instead of reporting on Biden's performance and Trump's performance in equal measure and then continuing on, they wouldn't shut up about Biden's ""dementia"" which even if it existed Trump clearly actually does have dementia, showed it long before the debate, and far far worse besides.   As for the Democratic party, they panicked because the media wouldn't stop shitting all over Biden while ignoring the clearly unhinged Trump and forced Biden to step down. I'm not absolving them Democrats of responsibility here but yeah, it's largely the fault of the obviously biased mass media.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-09T11:08:16,1
"Lol, well, doesn‚Äôt that just paint an innocent picture of the Republican Party? Babies don‚Äôt do things out of malice; Republicans do.   So that‚Äôs not working, and tbh I‚Äôm just not even a little convinced that Republicans aren‚Äôt as bad as I think or Democrats are worse than I think. Any other attempts?  Edit: Also, from what you said I shouldn‚Äôt be able to find any legislation or other attempts by Democratic Party members to stop Republicans, right?",scotcetera,2025-05-08T18:26:18,1
"Uh huh. Right. The metaphor doesn't matter, the fact is that the Democrats could have stopped the Republicans and did nothing, making the Democrats just as responsible for our situation. They could have stopped Trump, they could have stopped the damage the Republican party constantly does every time they are in power, they could at least slow down Trump now, they don't. That makes them responsible.      The Republicans have been openly bad for decades the Democrats did nothing to stop them. It's not that they couldn't it's that they chose not to. That is a fact.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-08T18:30:58,1
"If it didn‚Äôt matter, I don‚Äôt think you would‚Äôve attempted it. I‚Äôm just not buying the attempts to make the Republicans look better than they are.",scotcetera,2025-05-08T18:31:41,1
