"I will say, the Cannabis drink market is doing something brilliant: they are catering to people who were already into seltzer drinks like Whiteclaw. They are catering to people who don’t want the bloat or hangover that can come with beer and liquor. Some of them are low to no sugar added. But you still get that relaxed or giddy feeling. Oh, no marijuana stench either. If I had to give up alcohol completely, I could because cannabis drinks exist.   The alcohol market is taking a hit because the masses are so health-conscious now, more than ever. Some see it as poison pure and simple, I say everything in moderation.",According_To_Me,2025-05-10T07:43:58,82
"Maybe this isn't the most mainline conservative take, but I wish we'd just move on from the hate for cannabis. The overwhelming majority of studies have pretty conclusively shown that it is less bad for you than alcohol so it baffles me that so many of us are still hellbent on its ban, especially when it comes to medical uses. That being said, I'm generally dubious about the nanny state banning vices until they negatively impact other people (e.g. banning drinking instead of banning drunk driving)",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-10T10:31:21,95

They are the BEST thing to happen to insomniacs. Works better than ambien and don't have to deal with the expense and time of multiple sleep studies. I will not support any Florida republicans who are attempting to ban them.,obscurityknocks,2025-05-10T14:04:25,10

"I did get 'sober' for my health, and it was easy because I just replaced my nightly white claw for a weed seltzer until I weened off the dependency to need to end my evenings with a beverage.",ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-10T12:17:43,14
Such the on point comment. It’s not destroying anyrhing: it’s change.,Blarghnog,2025-05-10T12:25:39,5
"We are so delayed in discoveries because of the ridiculous Schedule I classification that research was banned and certain aspects of it are bad for you.   It is still far better than alcohol but it isn’t 100% ‘harmless’ for all people.     It should be legalized federally, researched heavily, and taxed at a low-to-moderate rate to not make it as worthwhile for the cartels to operate a black market.",EC_TWD,2025-05-10T10:53:36,49
"I agree.  I don’t use it, but I don’t see any issues with it when used in moderation by adults.",Creeepy_Chris,2025-05-10T10:38:32,26
Less bad for you is such a bad standard to have.,Moist-Percentage7240,2025-05-10T13:26:31,-12
"Yes, and if weed ends up being a net negative for society, the market will correct.  I'm someone who needs a gummy to fall asleep when I have a stressful day of work, but I also can't stand the smell of marijuana and am rightfully annoyed when people are smoking in the subway station and other public areas. The market will correct with (and it already has) by offering more odorless ways of consumption.",ManufacturerFine2454,2025-05-10T12:39:21,6
They keep me away from the booze and give me restful sleep. My liver numbers are back to normal and I feel much better. Only negative effect is I'm still barely stoned the next morning when I wake up. After my morning coffee and shower I'm ready for the day. Much better than any sleep drugs I've been prescribed.,allison_c_hains,2025-05-10T14:31:17,5
