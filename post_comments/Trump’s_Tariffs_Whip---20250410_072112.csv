"Today’s Washington Post has an article that says, “In an interview, Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nevada) said Trump’s post Wednesday raised suspicion that members of the administration may be trading on information about tariffs in advance of it being disclosed to the public. “It’s my concern that the administration may be using trade policy to give insider information to individuals before impending actions or inactions,” he said. “If it occurred, that is market manipulation.”Horsford said he is calling for a full investigation into who may have profited from this information, but he acknowledged that carrying out such a probe would be difficult when the administration has fired many of the inspectors general who normally provide such oversight.”",skittlazy,2025-04-10T08:03:38,31

Corruption led the Serbians to the streets.    I hope people use this word more than nuance words.  What looks like and acts like a duck is a duck.  Most people don't understand insider trading or market manipulation.  They understand corruption and bribery.

He’s no longer hiding his corruption. He knows he has a limited amount of time to do his dirty work. He is a 78 year old man who has quite literally never had to pay for his crimes. He feels he can get away with anything and he may be right.,Sioux-me,2025-04-10T10:18:36,11

"Anything to cover for him, if you got told a few hours before he was pausing you would have made huge easy cash. Market went up an obscene amount and it was obvious that would happen if you knew a pause was coming in hours. That was obviously told to people in advance so they could profit at the expense of everyone else. Also his post on social media that in hindsight was a signal to buy the market wasn't very obvious. I saw it a few minutes after posted and couldn't make definite sense of it. It's not like he directly said tariffs are getting paused soon.",okhi2u,2025-04-10T08:13:02,5

Trump did a dozen things impeachment worthy in his first week back in office alone. Not that it matters since he's never going to be impeached and Congress is making zero real attempt to actually impeach him anyway.

Exactly. The problem isn't our system of governance it's the fact that Trump and his cronies managed to worm their way into every corner of it while those who SHOULD have stopped him and had plenty of opportunity to do so did absolutely nothing. We've already got laws and Constitutional amendments that exist to stop exactly what Trump is doing but it doesn't mean jack if those who are in place to enforce those either are on Trump's side or are too lazy to do anything about it. Laws don't mean anything if nobody enforces them.,immortalfrieza2,2025-04-10T13:41:42,2
