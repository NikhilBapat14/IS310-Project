“The mayor of New Jersey’s largest city and a Democratic candidate for governor was handcuffed and detained by federal officials on Friday at a protest of an ICE facility following a scrum involving three members of Congress seeking a tour of the facility.”,Lantis28,2025-05-09T14:53:42,23

"Have the local or state police arrest ICE, detain them over the weekend, then say ""Ooops, sorry"".",MentalTourniquet,2025-05-09T14:56:09,22
"This shit needs to stop immediately. ICE is the tip of these fascists’ spear and they are destroying lives and wrecking the last of what’s valuable in this country.  If you are an ICE agent, it’s time to quit today. This can’t go on. There will be a time not long from now where you will be forced to answer for making the world a shittier place to live. No one is going to listen to “I was following orders.” We see the glee in your inhumanity and you will never escape the derision. Kristi Noem will not he there to protect you.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-09T15:07:51,19

Wow! The mayor of this city needs to conduct investigations like these to ensure that this facility covered under the jurisdiction of local fire & PD is properly following codes and that they can properly coordinate with the Fire Chief to provide approximations for any future incidents. They're not letting the mayor ensure that private facilities like these can be handled properly by first responders (in classes of buildings that are known to have events with some of the highest elevated levels of dangers especially for responders)??,postsshortcomments,2025-05-09T14:59:24,13

"Welp its officially over. ICE well get more emboldened and more staffed up; will get assistance from the national guard and then the rest of the military. Every single member of LE is a spineless, traitorous coward, and deserves to be made an example of.",Kid_Charlamagne36,2025-05-09T15:12:44,0

ICE is this administration's brown shirts.,Thac0isWhac0,2025-05-09T15:18:18,8
I'm not sure anybody who works for ice isn't fully on board with their mission of being completely evil.   What's disappointing is that apparently all law enforcement has more or less been completely captured. DC police have notably let whatever sketchy may be bad wielding doge boys get away with stuff even when they show up.,shoobe01,2025-05-09T19:40:13,2
"So the Mayor, a STATE position, has no right to barge into a FEDERAL facility. If any of us did that, we'd be arrested too. Its called trespassing. The Mayor had no right, that's why he got arrested, but not the congress members, who do have an oversight right. We can't  break the law to get what we want. No one is above the law.",Opposite-Oil-6128,2025-05-09T19:15:14,-1
You can’t just decide someone is guilty of any statute you choose. You even admit he hasn’t been charged yet.  This is what happens when people are so ignorant of what “due process” means.,cap123abc,2025-05-09T15:07:10,11
"More like Gestapo. The Storm Troopers were more like Secret Service/Police for Nazi rallies and officials. The fact that ICE is so covert and secretive, focused on disappearing people, Gestapo is a better fit.  If ICE was running 20-30 people deep in city centers in clearly ICE identifiable gear, they'd be closer to the Brown Shirts.",triplec787,2025-05-09T15:32:53,8

"I think ICE is giving us clues about what they’re scared of. They’re desperate to remain anonymous, so exposing them seems like a good start. The communities they live in deserve to know that their neighbor is terrorizing kids and vulnerable populations in their name and getting off on it.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-09T16:06:28,4
"Uninformed people like you are a scourge on society. Trump impeachment was aquitted TWICE(meaning no wrong doing) J6 people got pardoned because it was PROVEN their civil rights were violated. No speedy trial, denied communication with lawyers, being held for years with no charges, prosecutor withheld thousands of hours of exculpatory evidence from the defendants. If the biden admin didn't violate their rights, those violent people would still be in jail and youd have your justice. But by blanket violating everyone's due process and jailing truly innocent people while you hide evidence that proves their innocence, this is the only remedy. When  prosecutors don't follow the law or ethics, the only remedy is a mistrail, as the well has been tainted.",Opposite-Oil-6128,2025-05-10T13:09:59,1
"And another thing. Just because you think someone else is breaking the law, you're not justified to also break the law.",Opposite-Oil-6128,2025-05-10T13:14:26,1
