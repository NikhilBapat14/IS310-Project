"Starve the beast. It has been the Republican strategy for decades. If you can rip enough funding away from local, state and federal government, you can convince people that the problem is that government doesn't work. Never mind the trillions in tax cuts and even greater trillions spent on military hardware that our Fox and Friends Weekend host seems unconcerned to see fall into the ocean at $70 million a pop.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-07T11:17:20,5
"*From Bloomberg News reporters Ted Mann, Shawn Donnan, and Nazmul Ahasan:*  In city halls and state capitols across the US, officials are readying for President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s aggressive cost-cutting campaign to land on their doorsteps.  State and local governments — in both Republican and Democratic strongholds — rely on federal dollars for the infrastructure investments, social programs and other projects that undergird their economies. Now, a wide swath of the $1 trillion in annual grants they receive from the federal government is under threat, creating deep uncertainty just as Trump’s trade war has raised fears of a punishing recession.  In St. Louis, a curfew-check program for juvenile offenders was suspended for a time earlier this year over a lack of clarity on funding. Officials in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, are contemplating cutting mental-health services and meals on wheels for seniors as they anticipate the disappearance of federal dollars. A street and transit overhaul in Nashville is at risk of being curtailed, despite years of public debate and a local tax initiative to help shoulder the cost.  While the extent and target of Trump administration cuts are not yet clear, these kinds of programs have drawn particular attention because of how they might appear to collide with the president’s agenda. Some social services offerings could be perceived as the kind of diversity, equity and inclusion program the president has railed against, and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has signaled a pivot away from mass transit and efforts to fight climate change.
