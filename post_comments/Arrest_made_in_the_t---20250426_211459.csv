"I dont mean this as a joke, but the fact that the Secretary of Homeland Security cant even secure her purse, and the Secretary of Defense is a goober like Pete Hegseth makes me worry we are wide open for a 9/11 level terrorist attack ",Additional-Software4,2025-04-26T23:00:27,75
"Sorry, but something about this just doesn't smell right.  *""Noem’s purse was stolen when a masked man walked into Capital Burger, a restaurant in D.C., on Sunday night. The man passed two plainclothes Secret Service officers who were sitting at the bar on his way to her table, which was upstairs.*   *He then sat down next to Noem’s table, where she was eating with her family, and put his foot on her purse to drag it towards himself, according to two sources familiar who viewed the surveillance footage. Then, he swiftly picked it up, tucked it under his jacket and walked out, passing the protection agents on his way out.""*  So this illegal immigrant with a mask on walks into a fancy restaurant all by himself, walks upstairs, sits down close enough to Noem and her family that he can literally touch them... and no one even noticed the guy?Apparently there is surveillance video so I hope it's made available for scrutiny.",Clairquilt,2025-04-27T06:35:44,18

"Best thing for the ladies, is to phase out the purses and handbags, which when put down anywhere can be stolen, and go to fanny packs, they at least stay on your person at all times. Not as stylish for sure, but much more secure.  Another thing that is way past due, is to deal with criminals, especially career criminals, much more harshly. Our current system just is not working to serve and protect the law abiding American citizen. Instead it seems to be set up to enable, coddle and protect the criminal.",DoktorDetroit,2025-04-27T14:10:58,0
