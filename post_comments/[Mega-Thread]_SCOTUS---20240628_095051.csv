If the court decides the president has immunity... what's stopping Biden from having Trump assassinated or imprisoned as long as it's an official action?,Lokarin,2024-07-01T21:36:19,1
"Personal anecdote for Chevron just so everyone can see the weight and impact.  Note: I am the conservative mod here. I also went to a law school in a more conservative area.  Back in law school a few years ago, during my administrative law class, the professor asked: Who thinks Auer deference should be overruled or stands on bad grounds? (auer says a court gives deference to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations). Of the 50 person class, 15-20 raised their hand.   He asked the same question as to Chevron. Only one hand raised-mine. After discussing, we had maybe 3-4 that agreed.  I figured this may be useful to share to demonstrate just how popular Chevron was.   It’s my opinion we now revert back to Skidmore deference.",SGP_MikeF,2024-07-04T12:44:00,1
"Is it safe to say that when a person places themselves above the law, they exist outside of the protections of the law in the eyes of the public, thereby cutting off other avenue's of serving justice except by violence or force?  My mind keeps going here, maybe because it's the scariest outcome.  My thought is that the power of the law fundamentally depends on the perception and acceptance of its fairness and equality by the people it governs. When the public perceives the law as unequal or biased, their trust in the legal system erodes, leading to several significant consequences.",doggoroma,2024-07-06T15:58:06,1

">what's stopping Biden from having Trump assassinated or imprisoned as long as it's an official action?  Does the President have the Constitutional authority to direct either an assassination or arrest of someone at their own direction?  SCOTUS Blog is a very good go-to to discuss [the case](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-united-states-3/) and a write-up [here](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/07/justices-rule-trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution/).  For the ""conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority"" a President has absolute immunity and for official acts beyond that, there should be a *presumption* of immunity.  Basically, ""a president should have immunity from criminal prosecution for his official – but not his unofficial – acts unless, at the very least, prosecutors can show that bringing such charges would not threaten the power and functioning of the executive branch.""  Note that this is decision is providing the guidelines for the District Courts to go back and evaluate all of this.  It basically means they'll have a two or three step process:  1. Was the act official or non-official?  If the latter, case can continue. 2.  If official, was it a core duty?  If the latter, case is closed. 3. If not a core duty, would charging for that action "" not threaten the power and functioning of the executive branch""?  If it wouldn't, case can continue.",AuditorTux,2024-07-02T08:47:56,1
"Piped my question through GenAI to see what the internet gods think and:  ""Yes, it is safe to say that when a person places themselves above the law, they are perceived as existing outside the protections of the law in the eyes of the people. This perception can lead to the belief that traditional legal avenues for serving justice are ineffective, thereby leaving violence or force as the only remaining options for redress. Here’s a more detailed breakdown:  # Perception and Legitimacy:  1. **Loss of Legitimacy**:    * When a person places themselves above the law, they lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people. The perception that they are not subject to the same rules as everyone else erodes trust and respect for their authority. 2. **Erosion of Legal Norms**:    * The belief that someone is above the law undermines the rule of law and legal norms. This erosion creates a sense of lawlessness and unfairness, further delegitimizing the person's authority.  # Cutting Off Legal Avenues:  1. **Ineffective Legal Systems**:    * People may perceive the legal system as ineffective or complicit if it fails to hold the powerful accountable. This perception can lead to the belief that legal avenues are futile. 2. **Frustration and Desperation**:    * The lack of effective legal recourse fosters frustration and desperation among those seeking justice. This can lead to the conclusion that alternative, non-legal means are necessary to achieve justice.  # Turning to Violence or Force:  1. **Last Resort**:    * When legal avenues are perceived as closed off, violence or force may be seen as the last resort for addressing grievances and restoring justice. Historical and contemporary examples show that people often resort to violence when they feel they have no other options. 2. **Vigilantism and Rebellion**:    * The perception that someone is above the law can lead to acts of vigilantism or organized rebellion. Individuals or groups may take justice into their own hands, leading to potential conflict and bloodshed.  # Historical and Contemporary Examples:  1. **Revolutions and Uprisings**:    * Many revolutions and uprisings throughout history have been driven by the perception that rulers were above the law and unaccountable. Examples include the French Revolution, where the monarchy was seen as out of touch and beyond legal reproach, leading to violent revolt. 2. **Modern Authoritarian Regimes**:    * In modern times, authoritarian regimes where leaders act with impunity often face significant internal and external resistance. This resistance can manifest in protests, civil unrest, and sometimes violent uprisings.  In conclusion, when a person places themselves above the law, they are seen as existing outside the protections and constraints of the law by the people. This perception can lead to the belief that legal avenues for justice are ineffective, thereby making violence or force appear as the only viable means to address grievances and restore justice.""",doggoroma,2024-07-06T15:58:35,1
