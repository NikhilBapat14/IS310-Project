What will actually happen is that judge is about to retire on the millions of tax payers money they’ll win in this stupidly easy lawsuit they’ll file.   Hard to be any more mental than whoever ordered that arrest.,khronos127,2025-04-25T11:33:25,11

Exactly. It’s not. But they want to intimidate the judges and scare the general public from helping those that are undocumented since they are getting no due process and being cruelly shipped off to El Salvador. She is being used as an example.,kolaida,2025-04-25T12:40:17,4
"How is it **not** obstruction of justice when a *judge* intentionally thwarts federal agents attempting to serve a valid warrant?  Some people get beaten and abused by prison guards, it doesn't mean a judge can help someone slip out the back door because they worry about that.",lucy_throwaway,2025-04-25T16:02:37,-5

ICE did when the judge helped the alleged wife beater escape out the back door of the court house. This is text book obstruction of justice.,lucy_throwaway,2025-04-25T16:08:11,-8

"Your argument makes no sense because it’s trying to talk about the context of the law.  ICE isn’t following the law, their arrests are going straight to deportations which is a violation of the 14th amendment: providing the right of due process for everyone regardless of immigration status.  Why should anyone respect a search warrant if they know that the official laws following that search warrant is not going to be respected ?",Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-04-26T06:12:47,3

"You can sue any federal agency through the federal tort claims act. Qualified immunity only protects officers if they made a mistake any reasonable person could make.   This requires two or three court proceedings, one in which they decide whether qualified immunity will be denied and , one where they decide what damages took place and the civil rights violation and the last if there was criminal intent.",khronos127,2025-04-25T13:20:57,11
"You're thinking of due process rights in regard to criminal charges, which most immigration cases are not. For non-criminal cases, your rights are much more limited (not saying this is right, just that it is) often as little as a hearing after arrest and before deportation. More importantly there are legal pathways, that were put in place by Bill Clinton in '96, expanded under Bush and further expanded under Trump term 1 to remove people without *any* hearing.  Do you really think that a system in place for almost 30 years is completely unconstitutional? Don't you think that this would have been successfully defeated in court during those 29 years?  Hate to pull the whataboutism card, but if this is truly and patently unjust, why did Clinton implement it, GW Bush expand it, Obama use it, among other methods, to deport record numbers under his watch, Trumps expansion wasn't shot down in court and Biden do nothing but reverse the Trump expansion of that process rather than the 96 foundation? And the whole time the underlying principle of a no hearing deportation stayed in place with no meaningful challenges in the courts.  Now lets fast forward to this Judge. She's dealing with a criminal case against the man, completely separate from his immigration issues. ICE shows up to serve a valid deportation/arrest warrant. They are instructed to wait until after the hearing to detain him. Instead she helps him sneak out through a employees only exit.  That simply isn't legal, and if anyone should understand that perfectly its a judge. You're intentionally stopping agents of the government from doing their duty. She had no reason to believe that his rights would be violated, and even if that was the case, helping him escape wasn't a legal way to advocate for him.  It's a reasonable concern that the Alien and Sedition Act deportations will be struck down in court and they are ultimately a violation of due process-- this case isn't that though.",lucy_throwaway,2025-04-26T14:41:16,1
"You're right, and we don't know that he beat his wife, just that he's accused of some form of domestic abuse three times. He could be a Grandma beater or an adult child beater or a sister beater.   ""Flores-Ruiz was arrested and charged last month in Milwaukee County Circuit Court with three counts of Battery-Domestic Abuse-Infliction of Physical Pain or Injury, the complaint states.""  ""The sergeant asked that the team wait in the hallway outside of Dugan’s courtroom and wait until proceedings were finished before arresting anyone, which the complaint describes as “standard practice.”""  ""She allegedly escorted defendant Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing deportation, through the “jury door” and into a non-public area of the courthouse.""",lucy_throwaway,2025-04-25T16:29:39,-3
