Walz was a DEI pick.,scully360,2025-04-30T13:04:14,71
">Walz said Harris chose him, in part, because, ‚ÄúI could code talk to White guys watching football, fixing their truck‚Äù and ‚Äúput them at ease.‚Äù¬†The Minnesota governor¬†described himself as the ‚Äúpermission structure‚Äù for White men from rural America to vote for Democrats.  Delusional and racist, but mostly delusional. ¬†",triggernaut,2025-04-30T12:30:15,105
"To reach out to men, they chose a huge pussy. It makes sense.",2696969,2025-04-30T13:00:48,74
I think everybody knew he was picked because he was a white guy to try to pander to white people due to their misguided delusions of identity politics aka racism.,RandolphE6,2025-04-30T13:04:15,34
So he is saying he was hired because of the color of his skin rather than the content of his character? So Walz was a DEI hire too?! I‚Äôm so confused.,ILikestoshare,2025-04-30T13:00:14,28
"Yeah, we were well aware at that sad and gross pandering. They toss it at every demographic and shame those who don‚Äôt follow along.",Chkrg,2025-04-30T12:57:06,20

"Well, chalk that up as another Walz failure.  The attempt was as transparent and ill-judged as those [Man Enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLzYPbtklGs) ads that were run in support of Kamala.  Conservative men aren't into identity politics‚Äîbut if we were, you'd need to chose someone much more like Don Draper or Patrick Bateman than an ineffectual, effete placeholder who visibly quakes in his shoes on the debate stage.  And for God's sake, if you're going to put a shotgun in his hand, [make sure he knows how to use it](https://youtu.be/2WF1yu_clBo?si=Ta15WeaQgsPM5yt2) before the cameras start rolling!",Westwood_1,2025-04-30T13:27:19,8
Virtue Signaling via performative self-flagellation is the single most nauseating and detestable act.,Highwiind-D4,2025-04-30T13:27:16,8

"I trust the reports that she was drunk while choosing him.   It gives her a decent excuse. Similar to the sea monsters I used to bring home, I can just blame it on the booze.",IhaveAthingForYou2,2025-04-30T13:30:42,3
"While everyone seems to be focusing on the race part of this, what sticks out more to me is the ""permission to vote for Democrats"" part that reveals just how wrong they are.  Men (actual men) don't need permission from anyone to vote however they see fit.  Men weight the merits of two competing options, cross reference that to their own values and choose which option better suits them.  It's this simple and nothing more needs be considered.  The reason the Democrats believe this is because they view every single thing via group identity whereas anyone voting is doing so as an individual.  It's an individual that enters the voting booth and it's an individual that choose who they vote for.  Not the various groups the Democrats attach that individual to.  Identity politics like that is, really, just being sheer fucking lazy.  Don't examine the core aspects of your policies (did the Democrats even HAVE policies in this last election?) and see if they resonate with what American voters want...nah, chuck all that and just go straight to pandering on a group level.  This is why they're in decline, so detached from the American electorate and why, I hope, they don't wise up anytime soon...if ever.",Euroranger,2025-04-30T13:20:06,8

No shit. My vote went based on merit not skin color,aethiestinafoxhole,2025-04-30T14:42:17,3

Glad this guy lost.,Crisgocentipede,2025-04-30T17:22:31,1
Literally a DEI pick.  Funny thing is people like Walz and David Hogg are what out of touch Democrats think white men are actually like..  They see them both as representatives that would draw them in.  They really have no clue.,cathbadh,2025-04-30T19:00:59,1

"That‚Äôs a spot on analogy, he seems like the type to promise a class full of kids a free college education only to give them laptop batteries except one black kid gets a few bucks",chillthrowaways,2025-04-30T13:15:53,7
Yeah I knew he was a middle class blue collar guy when I watched him try to load a shotgun.,bulldog522002,2025-04-30T16:40:46,2
"Its not even the task that matters. But just the actual fire behind it. I am sure the big brain coders can't do such things. And that's fine. They know where they are valuable. It's not the task, its the showing up.   Timmy just wants to grasp, and fit in whatever role is dictated to him. As such he will never be seen as a ""man"" in the eyes of Americans.",thatfordboy429,2025-04-30T19:39:32,3
