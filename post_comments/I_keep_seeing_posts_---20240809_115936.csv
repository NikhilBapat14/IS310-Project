"I don't know if Harris will do her acceptance speech at Soldier Field but I can't think of any reason she'd have trouble filling it.  I was part of MSNBC's press delegation to the 2008 DNC so I had a pretty good view of how the convention worked.  First off, you have to remember that the delegates themselves aren't going to miss the speech for the world.  That's ~5,000 people right there.  The rest of the seats were filled from Denver and the surrounding areas.  There were, of course, support staff from the press delegations and other folks in town for the convention who weren't delegates but, for the most part, they all fit inside the Ball Arena where most of the DNC actually happened so we can cap them at ~15,000 people. That leaves another 50,000 seats to fill. While I have no doubt that people drove in from other cities to see the acceptance speech, the DNC was handing those tickets out all over Denver.  It was very much a party atmosphere; there were t-shirt sales and concessions and buskers all over the place.  The DNC opened the doors and Denver showed up.  All of which is to say that Denver filled the bulk of the seats at the acceptance speech because... well... how often do you get to see a major party nominee give an acceptance speech for real?    Chicago's population is about 3.5 times that of Denver. While Denver voted a few points more blue in 2020 than Chicago, that difference is a rounding error next to the population difference.  Mass transit in Chicago, especially serving the downtown area, is better.  All taken together, I expect that if Harris is going to do a stadium acceptance speech she'll have no problem filling it.",Killfile,2024-08-09T12:32:46,57
"It's different.  Obama really built up the hype over a longer period of time and so it was deeper and more durable.  With Harris I think it's partly about her (and now Walz), but potentially more about the sheer amount of relief and newfound hope of defeating Trump vs the despair they felt for months and months.  Because it's more situational than built up there is some chance that the enthusiasm and energy could wane.  Dems have to hope that the short time period, energy brought by the candidates, and the desperation to defeat Trump and MAGA is enough to keep the energy up.  After Obama won there were people in my office watching the inauguration on TV and holding each oher and crying in joy.  And they were Canadians!  You're not likely going to get the same kind of response so widely for Harris although I do know there will be massive relief if Trump is defeated.",ptwonline,2024-08-09T15:14:32,26
"I think the Harris campaign right NOW (and the last week) is generating similar energy and excitement to Obama. I do not think she can keep it for largely two reasons:  First, Obama was/is a phenomenal public speaker. People liked going to rallies and hearing him speak because he is a good speaker, had good talking points, and clever lines to get them across. He also seemed genuine and truly believed what he said. Harris, while she's fine, is nowhere near as engaging and energetic as Obama is. Harris will be unable to have people hanging on her words like Obama, and will subsequently have messaging issues.   Second, Obama's campaign had the additional morale boost of knowing they were going to win. There was little doubt Obama was going to win in 2008. The GOP was in the crapper after Bush (so much so they asked Bush NOT to campaign or even endorse McCain), and McCain picking Plain was seen as a ""hail mary"" to bring in votes. So Obama was also riding on the high of knowing they were going to win, and crowds cheer the loudest after the team wins. Harris is nowhere near guaranteed a win, so her campaign is mired with tension and apprehension, and that drags down the campaign as Democrats will constantly second guess her policies, speeches, debate performance, etc. wondering if someone else could have won.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-09T12:15:24,32
"The comparison folks have made between Obama and Harris's campaign has to do with the energy behind it - we haven't seen this kind of excitement for a dem campaign since Obama. They aren't saying she's the second coming of Obama.  And honestly holding candidates to the standard of his oratory skills is a bit unfair.    The excitement behind Kamala's campaign is different. So much of it's motivated by liberal relief that we won't have to ride with Biden right off the cliff and that we've got a fighting chance.  The whole campaign had this doomer apocalyptic vibe up until Biden dropped out. I don't know how much of the energy is Kamala and how much of it's just ""HISTORY,"" but she's the right candidate for the moment.  She's got the memeable goofy aunt energy people need, and she was smart enough to choose the populist charm factory that is Tim Walz as her running mate. Her campaign feels about as fun as a political campaign can be.",MR_TELEVOID,2024-08-09T13:24:35,10
Her team NEEDS to stay on the attack. For too long the Dems tried to play nice and it cost the country a lot. If they just keep going after trump and the gop they can keep a lot of energy going not only in the USA but for a large part of the world.,mawkishdave,2024-08-09T13:51:32,11

"As a concerned and insightful Democrat, I strongly urge Kamala Harris to deliver a “public address” (or, at minimum, a town hall) to address the issues of immigration and inflation head-on.    This could turn her greatest vulnerability into her greatest show of strength, in setting the record straight by persuasively refuting all of Trump’s distortions, exaggerations, and outright lies regarding linking crime, economic hardship, and inflation to illegal immigration.    It is self-evident that a huge segment of Trump’s supporters BELIEVE his distortions, exaggerations, and lies, due in large part to Ms. Harris’s electing not to refute them, with specificity, with facts and well-informed arguments.    At this eleventh hour, you need to do something bold and unexpected that is sure to draw widespread media attention (and, most importantly, set Trump back on his heels).    This could be our October surprise!    I dare say the “opportunity economy,” the “raising up the middle class,” even the trope of “Trump being unhinged and too unstable to be President,” while all valid talking points, they have become a broken record.    Unless Ms. Harris truly believes that the Biden-Harris administration has been a glaring failure in addressing immigration and the economy/inflation \[which we know not to be true\], it is time to stop deflecting and avoiding addressing Trump’s repeated lies and distortions on these two pivotal issues, but to forcefully refute them.    Shedding the light of truth on the darkness of Trump’s many lies could truly sway undecided and independent voters in our favor.    I can only hope you give this suggestion serious consideration.

"she has nowhere near the charisma of Obama. Walz is more interesting to listen to tbh. Also not the first black president in history, and also just won by default since Biden dropped out so no one really chose her.",Quinticuh,2024-08-09T13:43:12,1
"While I agree with that, there has no politician who has united the country during campaign in the past 20 years as much as Obama did.  Obama's popularity was much higher than Kamala Harris, and many many independent and Republicans voted for him.  For context: a lot of people talk about how Hillary won the popular vote in 2008.  In spite of that, and with a lower population, Obama got 4 million votes more than Hillary, and beat McCain by 8 points.",solid_reign,2024-08-09T13:13:32,24
"I was a college student in Denver for 2 weeks during convention time in 2008 myself. Went to it a couple nights at the Pepsi Center and the big speech at Invesco Field. That was one of the coolest experiences ever. The place was packed and the enthusiasm was palpable. Really something to see. That said, while the enthusiasm for Harris/Walz is good, it’s nothing like it was back then.",kmckenzie256,2024-08-09T12:37:53,8

The night Obama won is a memory I’ll never forget. I was in college at the time and the vibe was electric. In truth it’s more than a memory; it was a feeling. I’ve never felt more optimism for the future of America than I did in that moment. ,JeffreyElonSkilling,2024-08-09T16:40:27,7
"Well, the last part has yet to be seen so it can’t be compared to Obama’s victory. For double emphasis: it isn’t over and far from a sure thing.  A huge part of what made Obama’s win so exciting was that it was historic and broke a long precedent. If fate will have it, this election could make history too, breaking a glass ceiling that will be very personal for over half the population. That will get many people emotional and excited if it happens.",Taitrnator,2024-08-15T07:43:15,1

It's way easier to generate excitement for a campaign that only has to work for about 100 days.  Much easier than having to go out and stump for 2 years.  Or 4 years in DonOlds case.,Phog_of_War,2024-08-09T13:48:30,7
"I would add that McCain would have been seen as a continuation of the Bush era wars and the collapse in the worldwide economies that happened under the GOP Presidency.   2024, Biden has done nothing to anger or excite the world, boring but fundamentally crucial things like bringing back semiconductor manufacturing will only have an impact in 20 years if China invades Taiwan, however that is nothing to run off.",seanosul,2024-08-09T12:28:04,2
"I don’t think the “joy” of this campaign will last that long. If you are objectively listening, there is no hopeful message of a better tomorrow. There’s a lot of smiles though…. It’s still primarily the “I’m speaking, STFU unless you want Trump to win,” type message, however. I have a lot of issues with Obama in retrospect but at least he was popularly elected as the Democratic presidential nominee when I campaigned for him in 2008 and that he promised for hopeful change. I haven’t seen any concrete policy proposals from Kamala yet. I get it’s only been a few weeks. I get her policies are probably just Biden’s. But I want to hear it from the candidate. “Codifying Roe v Wade,” isn’t as good as saying a real concrete policy of how many weeks, what protections, or how you’ll get there. Like it or not, but Obama was earnest enough to explain that stuff in detail durning his campaign. But if I put on my “campaign hat,” I would tell Kamala to stay as vague as possible and ride out the election by not alienating anyone. There are so few weeks left, enough people will stay joyful or at the very least tolerate the situation enough not to make a stink before they vote.",newglarus86,2024-08-09T17:59:31,2
"I think your second point undermines the point you're trying to make. Part of the reason enthusiasm is so high for Harris is because the election is close, and more importantly, the STAKES of the election are high. It's not hyperbole to say this election could be a life or death situation regarding who wins. Had Hillary Clinton been President, thousands fewer would have died due to her taking it seriously and being competent. There are so many issues similarly that affect people's lives like women's Healthcare.",clkou,2024-08-09T16:35:46,1

"> Obama got 4 million votes more than Hillary, and beat McCain by 8 points.  Obama was certainly a singular historical moment.  That said, I'm not sure those comparisons are valid ones.  Hillary was a _famously_ unpopular figure in politics.  Republicans had spent literally _decades_ demonizing her by the time she ran for President in 2016.  And McCain, while not a bad guy, had the misfortune to run for office as a Republican just as the bottom fell out of the financial markets in 2008.  Lehman Brothers collapsed on September 15th.  I remember getting that news, turning to my wife and saying, ""that's it; Obama has it in a walk.""

I remember David Letterman ripping into him for misleading him about why he cancelled his appearance, McCain was literally a few blocks away doing the Palin interview when he was suppose to be on the Letterman show.",Naliamegod,2024-08-10T01:17:03,1
"It depends on how well she got to the grassroots and dug up support. Obama had the entire year to fire up the minority voters to support him.
