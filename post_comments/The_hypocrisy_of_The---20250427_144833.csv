They gleefully and smugly mocked those who were upset about Harris losing. I guess January 6th never happened.,Confident-Novel-1855,2025-04-27T15:05:51,13
"Shocker. Those who are GEOTUS followers follow what he says, even if it's inconsistent with what they officially spout. Since they follow a morally bankrupt man, they themselves tend to be, which causes the problems that are described above ",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-27T14:54:32,7
That’s a defining characteristic of being on the right— the near complete immunity to hypocrisy.,ginrumryeale,2025-04-27T18:15:19,7
"#2 should definitely include the whole pardoning of almost 1,600 scumbags who were apart of Jan 6th including over 600 that were charged with some sort of violent assault or impending law enforcement.   That group of around 1,600 that Trump pardoned who stormed the capital that resulted in over 140 officers injured,  1 dying the day after and 4 who have committed suicide.  If doing that isn't spitting in the face of law enforcement then I don't know what else is and absolutely needs to be included in the above list as it would make it a bit more impactful atleast in my opinion   Edit:  also including something regarding the tariffs in point #1 as those tariffs will not only impact goods bought at big box retailers but will absolutely impact small businesses and put many out of business.   Reading the list has some great points but I feel like it's not quite as impactful as it could if it included more detailed info and policies/executive orders that Trump has implemented that really highlights the hypocrisy.  Love the list....just feel like if the time is spent that it can be improved and spread the message in a more clear and powerful way     [source ](https://www.policeforum.org/trending25jan25)",kpofasho1987,2025-04-27T15:51:04,5
