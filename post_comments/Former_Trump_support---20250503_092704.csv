"This is something I am almost positive I mentioned here before.  I have in-laws that voted Trump.  They say they would have voted Sanders back then but the Democrats saw fit to spin a narrative.  Fact is, he won or was second in many early primaries.  Biden was well down.  Then Biden wins South Carolina and for some reason that was enough.  Hell, Sanders won some of the primaries after.  Had they gotten behind him this mess would not have happened.     Why did these in-laws like him?  For things Republicans do not do.  He talked about being for the working class and all that.  Oddly, they like that.  Yet vote for Republicans who cut the taxes on the wealthy.  Republicans who talk down about the poor.  Voting against their own interests.  And yes, these people would have voted Sanders.  I still hear that from some.  How they wanted Sanders.  Then they talk about how the Democrat ""deep state"" and MSM made sure he could not ""upset their gravy train"" as one put it.     I saw a comment someone where a person claimed they supported Trump but was afraid he was bringing about the anti-Christ.  They still supported him currently though.  They could see all the evil awful shit he does and are scared.  But Democrats may let a woman have a right to her own body, support equal rights for LGBTQ+, and all that.   Cannot have a poor person get ""sum ma taxes"".  Blinded and brainwashed by the hate and evil they say they are against.

He never worked an honest day in his life. But most voters' analysis doesn't go that far. They want to say fuck you, and he's an excellent candidate for that.   Now, not everyone is that stupid.

Had they gotten behind him this mess would not have happened.  After SC, Biden was only 8 pledged delegates behind Bernie and led in total vote count.  He wasn't way down.  The problem for Bernie was SC showed that Pete and Amy's early success hadn't earned them added support in later states and most importantly among black voters (Biden won 61% of them with Bernie being second with 14%, meaning they got less than 14% of the black vote).  Simply, it was clear that Pete and Amy had no room to grow thus they couldn't win.  So they dropped out and endorsed the candidate closer to them politically.  Ironically, it might have better for Bernie if he allowed Pete to claim his Iowa win without controversy and narrowly win in New Hampshire as that could have potentially made him do at least slightly better in SC.",bootlegvader,2025-05-03T12:02:45,2
