"Conflict of interest much?Â    DOGE has absolutely no interest in this except for the fact that Musk is involved in both.Â    This is clearly an illegal usage of authority to help a private contractor.   Not to mention Starlink should have absolutely nothing to do with any system that has human safety requirements. It's too fragile, vendor lock in, ongoing costs are high, etc.",CockBrother,2025-04-26T05:31:50,25

"Well, there is a reason the FAA still runs Windows 95.  But if anyone was going to touch it, DOGE would be the ones.  We're going to have the biggest plane crashes. The best plane crashes.  edit: I'd love to see the W95 solution replaced. But no one touched it before because of cost. Rewrite needs to be a future proof Linux solution. DOGE will just make the W95 corpse worse than it already is.",GangStalkingTheory,2025-04-26T07:27:10,8
Signed under duress makes the NDA unenforceable.,Birthday-Tricky,2025-04-26T07:20:36,14
"Thatâ€™s totally antithetical to very basis of our system of government. You are supposed to be able to track and understand how our government spends our tax dollars. Government grants and contracts can be viewed on SAM.gov and even sole sourcing a contract is unusual. Even in the DOD and intel community, it is very unusual for something to be so secret that you donâ€™t have any idea what the government is doing and how much theyâ€™re spending on it. This an egregious, undemocratic corruption of our institutions into crony oligarchy.",finallytisdone,2025-04-26T13:16:01,6
"Yeah, thatâ€™s gonna get challenged in court. Almost motherfucking immediatelyâ€¦ Canâ€™t tell you how many states and how writ large NDAs are unenforceable for the vast majority of situations especially in the US. TONS of precedent here.",maybetryyourownanus,2025-04-26T09:45:58,4
