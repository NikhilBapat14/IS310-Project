Show up very early if you want to be closer to the stage. The queue outside will grow larger as it draws closer to the door opening.   Speakers won't generally begin until enough time has passed to seat everyone inside. I'd show up two hours early if you want to guarantee yourself getting inside and a seat.  I enjoyed my first campaign rally. I went to the Bernie Sanders one in 2015 where the little birdie landed on his podium in Portland. Hopefully yours is as memorable with Kamala and your first campaign event attendance.,RobbyRyanDavis,2024-08-07T14:23:29,4
"My general rule of thumb is to arrive two hours before the start time or one hour before the doors open time if one is listed. This usually guarantees making it inside before they fill up. Arrive earlier if you really want to be in the front or want to be sure of making it inside.  Some other advice based on having been to way too many:  Wear comfortable shoes and plan to be standing the entire time. Some events will have seat, most will not.  You will go through Secret Service screening before going in. Varies by event, but be prepared for airport level security. Don't bring things you don't have to.   A lot of these, if you need to go use the restroom, you are going to lose your place in line or on the floor so plan accordingly.   It will not start on time, they never do. How late things are is dependent on a lot of factors.   If the venue maxes out on capacity, always ask if there's an overflow area. Some events have them and some don't.   Also, I would not plan to be out exactly on time. I once got within 5 feet of the exit when they decided to hold the crowd so the motorcade could leave. We were waiting for close to an hour for that to happen.",WhiskeyCoke77,2024-08-07T22:15:46,4
"I would add don't expect to leave as soon as it's over even if you're already in your car. Getting tens of thousands of people back on the road after an event can be a very slow process. And be sure you know where you parked. Also, if it starts anywhere near 6pm, don't expect to be able to get dinner after. Eat first. And have FUN!!",DidjaSeeItKid,2024-08-08T01:21:52,3
