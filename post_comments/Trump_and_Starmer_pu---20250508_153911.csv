Nothing changed except he removed the tariffs from steel & British cars... whoopie. What a master negotiator. Can't wait to buy my 1st Rolls Royce... ðŸ™„,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-08T15:44:57,12
"Dow went up when announced then started plummeting once people saw the deal. Closed up for the day, but not by much. Seems about right.  Any bets who near trump bought and sold stocks today?",ianrl337,2025-05-08T16:00:02,6
"Man, the two current most disappointing leaders standing side by side is really emblematic of how far both countries have fallen",Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-08T15:40:34,8
"Calling Trump a brain-dead, deeply-stupid, fucking idiot seems so inadequate.  He actually believes, because he said it at the trade ""deal"" announcement today, that when longshoremen and truckers lose their jobs because imports slow down it's a good thing because it means we make more money.  So if imports stop completely and tens of millions of people are thrown out of work because of all the industries that rely on imports to survive, in Trump's enfeebled brain, *that's good!*    How this man could bankrupt four casinos is a mystery.",hughcruik,2025-05-08T16:03:21,3
The hubris at these events is so overwhelming that it makes you want to vomit from the stench.,JoeCitzn,2025-05-08T16:11:57,2
Did anyone expect a *good* deal?  Trump was always going to sit their like a pissy baby and [insert country here] is going to do their best to wrest anything they can get to help mitigate the damage,SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-08T16:46:57,2
We want to know about the other 199 trade deals.,Omgpuppies13,2025-05-08T22:29:23,1
"Hmm. At that meeting in the Oval Office, Lutnick brags about *[Trump calling Starmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7n-KzgL0ak)* to get a deal done. Interesting. I thought everyone was calling Trump to make deals.",MadBlue,2025-05-08T23:18:47,1
Look at what the market did in response to the headlines pushed. Itâ€™s one part market manipulation one part overcompensation to save it. An ouroboros of wealthy asshats eating each otherâ€™s lunch.,jammyjamman,2025-05-09T03:17:09,1
"The best he could do was ask Starmer to go along with him while he basically repeated that no actual deal had been reached, and a deal is still being sought.  That's England being a friend.",IJustLookLikeThis13,2025-05-09T05:29:52,1
"You can't have 35 rolls,  you can only have 3.",knightcrawler75,2025-05-08T16:18:22,12
" But there's still a 10% tariff on all other British imports to the U.S., meaning US-GB trade is still less free than it was before Trump's ""big beautiful"" tariffs.  How much steel do we import from Britain anyway??",Wurm42,2025-05-08T16:46:55,3
Brother donâ€™t waste money on a rolls. Buy a Jag.Â ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-08T16:38:46,0
I honestly do not understand investors.  All indications are leading to recession and yet the stock market is going strong.  Maybe they identify with Trump.  If he is a failure that makes them failures.,knightcrawler75,2025-05-08T16:19:49,5
This is not going to play well when the shelves are getting empty.  If the Dems had any sense they would pounce now.,knightcrawler75,2025-05-08T16:17:21,1
I think he got a good deal. The people I follow on YouTube are saying great things. Just ask Tim.,Agile-Music-2295,2025-05-08T16:49:21,1
How about No rolls. And you get a jag.Â ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-08T16:39:00,2
