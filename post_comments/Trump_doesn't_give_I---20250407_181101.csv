"I doubt Bibi went for the tariffs, IMO he is trying to get Trump to invade Iran or some bullshit like that so that his fascist coalition doesn't fall",HopeBoySavesTheWorld,2025-04-07T18:55:59,1
This might be the only smart thing Trump has done regarding tariffs. Israel should not get off for free. They take billions in aid from the US to commit war crimes,Presidentclash2,2025-04-07T18:12:40,1
"Not enough attention has been called to the fact that Trump has basically exempted Russia from his indiscriminate tariffs, despite having levied tariffs in almost 100 countries, many of them our allies.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-07T18:27:27,1
so is our government now essentially taxing itself on all the surveillance and security tech it buys from israel?,GatewayShrugs,2025-04-07T18:43:23,1
"Well, the mutual circlejerk session over hating on Iran did not end with a tariff rate lower than Iran.",steve_ample,2025-04-07T18:24:18,1
It’s okay. we are giving Them all the weapons they want.,Responsible-Bat-5390,2025-04-07T18:40:36,1
"I say place a 100 percent export tariff on every item purchased by Israel, ie cut the amount of free military weapons the us government sells to them inhalf. ",brenster23,2025-04-07T18:20:12,1
He gave Russia a break though.,Purify5,2025-04-07T18:20:04,1
we are living in the worst timeline aren't we?,wizgset27,2025-04-07T18:27:48,1
But Russia gets a break on tarrifs.  The Trump Administration reasoning is that it's because of their ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine...  ...which doesn't explain why Ukraine is on their tarrif list,Probable_Bison,2025-04-07T20:57:23,1
"Title seems to be misleading. The article doesn't say anything  about ""a break"". According to the article,  ""Trump told reporters during a visit with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday that he **had not decided whether to reduce** the 17% tariffs he announced on Israel last week"".",newsspotter,2025-04-07T18:45:24,1
I think they are trying to start shit in Syria first since the IDF started invading Southwest Syria after Assad was ousted in December and recently the Israelis announced that they were going to do tours in Syria on Passover.   https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-army-organises-hiking-tours-inside-occupied-syrian-territory,Rain_43676,2025-04-07T19:01:38,1
Second worst. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-07T18:31:04,1
We already sanction the hell out of Russia. We didn’t do anything to Cuba and North Korea either. There’s virtually zero trade between them,luckyluchianooo,2025-04-07T21:13:26,1
"Yeah but Syria is now an ally of Turkey so USA can't really fuck with it that much anymore (i hope at least), the only way i can see USA/Israel can invade Iran is via Pakistan and even that is unrealistic",HopeBoySavesTheWorld,2025-04-07T19:19:50,1
