"Gotta hand it to Republicans. They never give up.  Gutting the Voting Rights Act, overturning Roe, and now attacking the New Deal. These are signature Democratic policies. I'd sure like to see Democrats act like the GOP is gutting their party as well as their country.  Gov Pritzker has the right idea: Grab every megaphone and microphone to fight their cruelty and make sure Republicans cannot know a moment of peace.",Educational-Bank-353,2025-04-29T18:32:13,8

"Oh, I think we'll make it to the midterms, and I think the GOP is going to get shellacked in both houses of Congress unless they make some major changes in trajectory. Trump is a wannabe dictator, but he's made mistakes that a dictator can't afford. Basically he's a premature authoritarian. He is losing battles, in the courts and in the court of public opinion, and he's being openly rebelled against by small factions in his own party. Dictators need to have absolute  power worked out before they start using it. McConnell set the groundwork in the courts, but his work, though damaging, was by no means complete. If they'd have continued his slow approach making methodical and steady changes the Project 2025 folks might have pulled it off, but instead they saw Trump and popped like a virgin on prom night. A little nipple and they shot their shot. Now they are facing a recession and pushback from their own constituents with no one to blame but the current administration. So yeah, we're going to have elections next year, and though Trump's lackeys may fight the results, I think they're going to get kicked in the dick so hard their waspy grandkids are going to be born bruised",StormFireX001,2025-04-29T19:31:49,1
