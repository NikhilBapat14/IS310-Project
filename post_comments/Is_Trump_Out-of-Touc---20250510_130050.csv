"This is a crystal clear example of sane washing “journalism”, and how we got here.   Flippantly repeating the same questions as to which we have all known the answers to for quite some time numbs the electorate.  For example, from the article -  *”Welcome to a moment in which one of the most consequential debates Americans (and people the world across) are having is about whether the President of the United States is just a national embarrassment or has full-on blown a gasket.”*  So what you’re saying is we didn’t already have the answer to this question 5 (FUCKING) years ago when Trump, in all seriousness, on national television, told the American people to inject themselves with bleach? That wasn’t enough? Maybe the entirety of his entire first term, up to and including January 6? We’re still not quite sure, huh? Fuck off.   And for what it’s worth - what the fuck difference does it make? National embarrassment vs. full-on blown a gasket? How is any of this “debate” even relevant when the functional outcomes are either exactly the same, or impossible to differentiate the reason for their existence?  Shame on David Rothkopf and The Daily Beast. You are part of the reason we’re here, and you’ve learned nothing.

This lesion can last 3 to 6 weeks if left untreated.    Secondary syphilis appears four to ten weeks after initial infection and symptoms include a nasty rash with other symptoms and can fade after a few weeks.   The third stage is latent syphilis, and doesn't appear to have obvious physical symptoms.   Tertiary syphilis is the end stage, with three different presentations - gummatous syphilis with the tumours and deformities,  neurosyphilis, meningovascular syphilis, and lastly cardiovascular syphilis.
