Nice way to stand up for non bias journalism.  Let the propaganda flow free and fuck free speech. She turned her back on all journalists by doing this.  ,arilupe,2025-05-07T07:15:19,11
"Voice of America, as I understand, is largely directed at foreign audiences, promoting narratives critical of government and promoting more press freedom in places where it's severely curtailed... so it is already reflective of some bias (as all journalism necessarily is). Ironically, one of the mainstays of the propagandistic aspect of VoA is how it demonstrates (or demonstrated?) American press freedom.  I'm just wondering what in the hell OAN has to say to Uzbeks, Laotians, Macedonians, Ethiopians... could OAN staff even pick these places out on a map, let alone craft some version of their screed that has any relevance to the disparate political and cultural environments and realities in which VoA operates?",foraliving,2025-05-07T09:10:42,7

I did a comparative study of weekly news segments for a class once. Fox feels downright responsible when you set it against OAN.   I still remember some segment where some transgender subway rats in NYC were tied to Nancy Pelosi kneeling in a mask for BLM. I'm only being halfway hyperbolic there. At least a few of those things were somehow mysteriously linked together in an opening segment once.,fuckishouldntcare,2025-05-07T08:15:29,15
Fox actually drew lines in the sand at some propaganda and the far right absolutely hated them for that and moved to Newsmax(?) and OAN.   It’s pretty telling when Fox News isn’t even willing to go that far given they are 100% propaganda already.,Carefully_Crafted,2025-05-07T09:17:49,5
