That's not fake. That's a shot of her inner-self.,WoofWoofster,2025-05-02T19:13:08,70
"Where does this traitor get her groceries? Where does she get her hair dyed that obscenely unnatural blonde color? Where does she buy her overly priced clothes? FFS, show up in mass at ALL OF THESE PLACES to let these traitors know WE ARE NOT a Fascist State.",JoeJoeDogFace,2025-05-02T19:57:41,17
"Well, by Trumps logic, since we have a picture proving she does indeed have MS-13 tattoos, she should be deported.",aaron_adams,2025-05-02T20:12:41,13
"Don't miss the point, though. They deliberately did a shit job on their photo. If you show people something very realistic and then tell them it's real and they agree that it's real you have fooled them. Nothing more. But if you show someone an obvious fake and tell them it's real and they also agree it's real, then they've passed a loyalty test.",The_B_Wolf,2025-05-02T19:03:46,35

That's not fake. Stop. Do you want me to show you the picture?,Sure_Cost2934,2025-05-02T21:35:39,2
"I want to know what makeup she uses for work, to cover this up. Using Dump’s logic, this is what she truly looks like. It cannot be fake news. She actually looks better. It matches her Nasty attitude.",Alternative_Gate4158,2025-05-03T13:35:36,1
"The absolute funniest (saddest) part, in that interview the other day Trump seriously thinks the photoshop of the letters that they put on the photo to illustrate the point was what he actually had tattooed on his fingers.   Dementia has entered the chat.",Epicritical,2025-05-03T14:01:52,1
She just covers it with make up for TV.,FuzzyComedian638,2025-05-03T17:32:29,1

"Yeah, but this is a WAY BETTER PHOTOSHOP JOB than the Abrego Garcia one!",EngagedWorldWizard,2025-05-04T13:33:24,1
What are you talking about? This picture looks completely real to me. Can we get her ass on a plane ASAP?,Higher-Ed,2025-05-04T15:19:28,1

Wasn't Abrego a big-time domestic abuser?,IntergalacticPodcast,2025-05-02T20:24:09,-5
"This is dumb.   Two different judges in 2019 ruled there was enough evidence to tie him to MS-13, which is *why* it was ordered that he couldn't be returned to El Salvador.   Can either party be truthful anymore?",VintageLV,2025-05-02T20:02:23,-5
"No, not even close.  The inner-self of this bitch is much, much uglier, think of gangrenous weeping sores.  Edit to fix typo",sorceress94107,2025-05-02T19:17:05,28

"I couldn't decide whether someone was trying to fake that there were the actual characters ""MS13"" or whether it was intended as (very creative) labeling. Either way, I was as flabbergasted as ABC's Terry Moran that Trump thought that Abriego Garcia literally had those character tattooed on him.",pingveno,2025-05-02T20:03:03,8

"Oompa Loompa tRumple is mostly like the elder people these days.  Yes, he has guards (now the US type) so his bravdo is backed like a bully who has his friends around him.  Anyway, most people his age are easily scared and maniplulated..  he is just a puppet for worse things to come.",Beneficial-Nimitz68,2025-05-02T20:47:16,3
"His argument doesn't matter. The SCOTUS said he should come back for proper due process. My point is that it wasn't just about the tattoos. Additionally, it's *your* responsibility to do your own research.  I think he'll just be deported to another country almost immediately, anyway.",VintageLV,2025-05-03T08:11:40,1

"I like the mental gymnastics you're having to do on behalf of Trump.   After being called out, POTUS thinks he should come back for due process. (Wonder why? because he knows the admin can't prove he got it the first time? )  Trump's ""he had tattooos!"" (Clearly digitally added labels) outburst on national tv doesn't matter at all. Its totally normal for a president who has all of these completely logical ""do your own research"" arguments to substantiate his arrest with this one.   Riiiiight.  *edit* My point is people on reddit are totally justified to make fun of him",Strict_Inspection285,2025-05-03T08:46:46,0
