"We could have a tie vote or a Marks holding.   It seems likely that: Alito, Thomas, and Kavanaugh are siding with the schools; Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson with the State; Gorsuch is a noted “free exercise” expansionist who is more likely to side with conservatives but he also cares about procedural accountability; Roberts is an institutionalist and incrementalist.   If Roberts is willing to concur in judgement that religious schools can’t be categorically excluded from charter education contracts, then Gorsuch *could* be open to joining a Marks ruling that requires institutional/procedural safeguards (opt-out mechanisms, etc.) before religious schools can be considered for charters which would then be remanded to the lower court for review of whether proposed safeguards can satisfy establishment clause limitations while protecting free exercise rights.",atxlrj,2025-04-30T12:57:38,2
"It's always fascinating to see how differences in fundamental worldview drive people's reasoning.  In years past, a main idea behind secularism in schools was that it *protected* religion. Because it seems inevitable that if public resources flow to religious teachings it will advantage popular religions at the expense of minority religions. Anyone who has any political sense immediately knows that games will be played with money (as usual) and politicians who are certian *their* religion is the right one will seek to increase the money flowing to its teachings. and these debates will always flow in the direction of the popular religions or denominations and against the new and minority religions. Tensions will flame and it'll make politics even more annoying.   So to prevent this, the idea was to have schools be secular. To have no religious preferences, and to teach whatever seemed to be the scientific consensus (or was best supported with non-specificlly-religious evidence) and let specifically religious teachings get by with whatever resources they themselves can generate for their own propagation. The closest to fair we can get, given the circumstances.  And people accepted this line of reasoning. But, crucially, it relies on someone accepting that premise that secularism really is an absence (or nonpreference) of religion. A lot of modern Christians, however, reject this premise and strongly believe that secularism is actually a religious position, and one that is unfairly elevated by government policies such as this charter school rule to boot.  Now, I dont want to argue about whether secularism or atheism are religious beliefs, but I just find it interesting how this discussion can really change depending on these assumptions. Brett Kavanaugh, through his questioning, clearly seems to see it this way because otherwise it wouldn't make sense to suggest that religions are being discriminated against by rules favoring secularism.  Personally, I am conflicted. As a legal matter, I am not sure the establishment clause actually supports strict secularism in the way many seem to think it does. On the other hand, I am fairly certain the propagation of taxpayer supported religious schools (charter or otherwise) will benefit established religions *far* more than minority and new religions. Which seems unfair and contrary to the idea of a marketplace of idea.",Nefarious_Turtle,2025-04-30T13:46:21,2

> it might end up re-vitalizing the Christian Left    That would be a good outcome.    Catholic schools used to reliably churn out Left wing voters who care deeply with the poor and the disabled.

"Concessions have already been made to families that want to send their kids to religious schools. Tuition is where it should end.   Fundamentalist Catholics and Protestants have one thing in common, they both have no clue how large a role religious freedom played in separating from Great Britain. The freedom to exercise whatever religion you choose and the freedom from being forced to join a religion.  Jefferson was a self avowed Deist. He didn’t want to have someone tell him what to believe, and he didn’t want anyone else subjected to it either.  Fundamentalists are so fucking stupid. Direct funding of a religious school will lead to direct funding of churches.   I guess it’s time to colonize the ocean floor.",industrial-complex,2025-04-30T13:31:45,2

"The schools would argue that it is the family’s choice to enroll their child in their school so there isn’t any State coercion at play. I think there are limits to that in broader application but I believe this case involves a virtual school. Specific to this case, it’s hard to suggest that parents are compelled to enroll their children in a virtual school offering religious instruction.   The court has already affirmed several times that religious organizations can’t be categorically excluded from neutral public programs based on their religious status alone. The crux of this case is whether direct state funding of schools providing religious instruction and engaging in religious activities is a violation of the “establishment clause”.   In theory, I’m not sure that it is. Despite being a committed atheist, I am also a textualist and have long struggled with conventional interpretations of the establishment clause. To me, the clause is expressly prohibiting establishment of a state religion - prohibition of any neutral interactions between the state and religions in general (as indicated by traditional “separation of church and state” doctrine) is not well-grounded in the text.   However, functionally, I think there are major entanglement risks here. Do certain religions/sects have more demonstrated capacity for school/existing schools? Would granting religious schools eligibility likely lead to asymmetrical access between religions and sects? Is there a reasonable chance of one religion or sect being awarded the majority of charters? Is there risk of physical religious schools being among only few public options in rural areas, thereby introducing a new level of coercion? Is it likely that contracting decisions will become political, informed by religious affiliation/perception, and/or contingent on lobbying? Does that amount to sufficient “establishment” to be a violation of the establishment clause?",atxlrj,2025-04-30T13:44:47,0

"Understood. I’m a devoutly progressive Protestant and I don’t see anything good about this either. They shouldn’t hear the case.  I think by default, you demonstrate establishment the second you are taking taxpayer(government ) money to be used in the foundation or direct financing of a religious school, virtual or otherwise.   If we applied the same logic to a Baptist or Catholic Church, the way it looks is obvious. The fact that this is a school doesn’t change anything. It shows favor to a specific religious belief and set of rules that are not to be intertwined with the functions of government.  I would not be opposed to giving every child a voucher to go wherever they want, but the simple fact is that would lead to more inequality in the quality of education for most children.   The school is just grifting. That’s clear.   The fact that the SC took this case is optically wrong and Amy Coney Barrett shouldn’t have been the only one to recuse themselves.",industrial-complex,2025-04-30T14:28:02,1

"There have been cases involving churches. *Trinity Lutheran* was a case where the Court held that religious organizations couldn’t be categorically excluded from a a public grant providing renovation (via a program recycling old tires) of playground surfaces. Because the program was facially neutral and the uses secular in nature, it was held that churches couldn’t be excluded from public funding based on their religious status alone.   With evolving “free exercise” jurisprudence, it’s becoming less and less possible to apply establishment clause restrictions on private entities. An element of this case I didn’t expect to be so influential is whether Oklahoma charter schools are public actors or private entities. If they are found to be the latter, then it’s unlikely that the Court will opt for strict scrutiny of establishment claims.   I am thoroughly unconvinced that charter schools are not acting as state agents when providing K-12 education under state charter - under Oklahoma law and common sense, they surely are public actors. That does not appear to be the leaning of several current Justices.  Even so, if contracts are open to any religion or sect, we have to be specific about what constitutes “establishment”. Does the constitution prevent “establishment” of a pluralistic multi-faith (including secular) educational environment? I’m not sure it does but I’m also not convinced it doesn’t.",atxlrj,2025-04-30T15:02:03,1
"Let’s say a child wants to go to this virtual catholic school. They understand that catechism classes, mass and religious instruction are required as part of the curriculum and they are in agreement with such requirements, because they know that the secular teaching on Math/Science/History is above average and class sizes are smaller, leading to an overall increase in college preparation.  But as part of the Code of Conduct, they are required to agree to a statement of faith and/or join the Catholic Church. Should that have a bearing on this case. Does that qualify as respect to a specific religion?",industrial-complex,2025-04-30T15:34:57,1
