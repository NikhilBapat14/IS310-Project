does this sound like corruption to you?,Johnnie-Dazzle,2025-04-21T14:15:50,11
Didn’t the Biden DOJ go after one of the Trump Org executives for failure to declare a car service and upgrades and jail him at age 77. I don’t know the law end of this but can Warnock be charged in a similar fashion?,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-21T13:04:54,22
"Warnock’s lavish DeKalb County home came equipped with a plethora of luxury accommodations, including a 100-bottle wine fridge, a bluetooth-enabled cooking range, and remote-controlled privacy curtains. The senator hasn’t paid a penny out of his own pocket to live there because the church where he serves as a part-time pastor is footing the bill, the Washington Free Beacon reported. It’s a great deal for Warnock, but it may violate Senate ethics rules that limit how much lawmakers can accept from outside employment, the ethics watchdog Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) alleged in a complaint to the Senate Ethics Committee.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-21T13:16:00,8
Well it also screams an “agenda” when you say lavish $1million dollar home in Atlanta.  Also if he truly is a part time pastor and they comp his housing in addition to a pretty limited salary for that job how is it corruption?  You can dislike someone’s politics but not see something relatively reasonable on its face as corruption.,Swagastan,2025-04-21T15:14:41,8
