"As along time person who is into tech even back in the 70's and making little robots out of capsela, erector sets and learning electronics and such, I find the whole paranoia about AI laughable.  Most AI if not all is no more than a glorified Talking Eliza.  Also this is what is known as Frankenstein Syndrome  The Frankenstein Syndrome is a fear that human creations, particularly in the realm of science and technology, might turn against their creators and pose a threat to humanity. This concept is often used to discuss potential risks associated with advancements in fields such as genetic engineering and biotechnology.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-27T11:16:49,12
"Not scary. The amount of work a humanoid robot takes to maintain is far too high to ever threaten the remaining manufacturing jobs.  It also forgets that manufacturing already faced this crises 30 years ago. Robot arms and machines replaced large swathes of the manufacturing work force. Guess what happened to the floor workers? They now manage the arms and machines, clear them, and ensure they're safe to continue. You cannot fully automate a factory. At some point a human is needed to ensure everything is working as expected.",RossBot5000,2025-04-27T18:19:14,4

"But if Robots take over, there will be no more farts! ",GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-04-28T12:39:50,1
