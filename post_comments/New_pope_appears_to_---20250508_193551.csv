MAGA is big mad that a real Christian was appointed Pope.,Gr8daze,2025-05-08T20:23:09,13
Now if we could just get this Pope to follow the law and report child abuse. The churches record in priests abusing children doesnâ€™t bode well for this hiding the crime within the church. Why canâ€™t they value children?,signerster,2025-05-09T05:53:56,5

Exactly the kind of reaction any normal citizen of the world would have.  Hope the MAGAs are properly butt hurt and stay that way.  https://preview.redd.it/mwa8rtezgoze1.jpeg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3831f4207280963ea3df43955a8e5da7cdaf0ab7,Think-Hospital7422,2025-05-08T22:44:09,2

Exactly!! I'm so disgusted that people are acting like he is a decent human. How about we ask all the children that have been raped/molested by priest how they feel about the man who protects their rapists/molesters.,Unicorn_in_Reality,2025-05-09T11:07:22,0
