He’s an absolute disgrace to America and a traitor to the western world. How anyone still supports this blatant conman is beyond me. His motivations and intentions couldn’t be more clear. And none of them involve doing what’s in the best interest of the average American citizen. Unless you’re in the top 1% and sufficiently kiss his ass you and your well being and your way of life are thoroughly expendable.,A1sauc3d,2025-04-28T05:07:08,57
"That’s his job, that’s why Putin ran disinformation campaigns to help him get elected.  It should be obvious to everyone at this point that the long-standing rumors about Trump being compromised are true.",capaho,2025-04-28T05:37:44,20
Bloomberg’s exclusive analysis shows Donald Trump’s administration echoing Vladimir Putin’s language on Ukraine.      We examined thousands of Trump’s speeches and social posts — his recent views increasingly match Putin’s.,bloomberg,2025-04-28T05:10:42,13

It is the ultimate denial to pretend this isn't really happening. To pretend all the red flags of the past 25 years aren't waving. It's the ultimate fear to have to admit this is what's happened to us.,Hypnotized78,2025-04-28T16:02:00,1
"Last thing we want is Dozing Don to be a Puppet of Putin, Putin has basically won the war, Putin thanking North Korean troops publicly, he is not scared of anything after current events.   Messing with Putin right now would be the worst political move ever.",Merchant1010,2025-04-28T05:13:56,1

"So where’s the smoking gun?  If Trump is a Manchurian Candidate, why didn’t it come out in 2016, or 2021 thru 2024?  We’ve got a massive conspiracy where the president is a Russian asset and no one is dropping the evidence?  The CIA, FBI, and every foreign intelligence and investigative agency hasn’t been able to find a crack in this?  I mean yes, Trump is an easily manipulated tool, a groupie for other dictators, and working against the interests of America in favor of any global leader who’ll tell him what he wants to hear, but not one person with hard evidence can drop it in the public eye?    I’d love to see that evidence, because at least it would mean this whole mess was a failure of our own intelligence agencies and not the culmination of entire generations raised on anti-intellectualism and media manipulation happily burning the country down to own the libs.",SakanaSanchez,2025-04-28T06:26:24,-11
I know. And it seems to have only gotten worse. They’re so thoroughly insulated from any outside information that most of them never even hear anything challenging the narrative they’ve been fed. And if they do they’ve been conditioned to dismiss it because it isn’t coming from one of their approved source.,A1sauc3d,2025-04-28T05:27:33,4
"Dude. Let me demonstrate something. The signal chat debacle going on right now. It’s not up for reasonable debate what happened, at least on 2 separate occasions. Has Hegsteth come out and admitted to it? Or anyone else? They’ve spent weeks doing anything but admit the truth and be up front with the American people.  But it’s an obvious lie. It’s the lie that we all expect, and the lie they knew they were gonna say. They just continue labeling dems as evil and twist and suddenly it’s anyone’s fault but the people who actually did it.  There is mountains of evidence showing the very odd and continuously emboldened behavior trump and his admin gives toward Putin. The only reason, in the entire world, that you would believe there’s no fire with all of this smoke, is because you’re just believing the words coming out of the liars mouth. He has every reason to lie about it. You know the last time he didn’t lie about it? The very first time when he said “I’m fucked, this is the end of my presidency.” But I guess that’s prob just made up quote too yea?",jmkahn93,2025-04-28T07:10:11,12
"I’m not saying they aren’t grossly and criminally incompetent and corrupt, but how does a Russian asset become POTUS?  The Obama administration didn’t have enough intel to do something about it?  The four years of Biden administration couldn’t uncover anything?    Yes, jailing a political opponent or suspending an election is a bad image, but it’s better than letting these dipshits get the keys and shred everything while they throw THEIR political opponents in an el Salvadoran gulag.  At least they’d have evidence over the bullshit the current administration is pulling.    Is Trump a Russian asset?  Maybe, but we’ve got way worse problems than that if that’s the case, because fundamentally every person involved, even the ones who are supposed to prevent this from happening, have been compromised, and if that’s the case, why even bother covering it up?  At least if there is solid evidence we wouldn’t be pulling the same conspiratorial nonsense the right does.  At least the rest of the world could take a lesson about not letting these guys in to power because they will abolish the rule of law day 1.  Instead, we’re stuck where we are with the only thing we can absolutely say for certain is that the US is so stupid and corrupt we just let this happen, because in the vast international conspiracy not one single person can drop some actual evidence.  That’s the same shit we use to debunk moon landing denialists.",SakanaSanchez,2025-04-28T08:12:49,-3
">At least the rest of the world could take a lesson about not letting these guys in to power because they will abolish the rule of law day 1  Yeah, that already happened.   Say, why do you suppose Trump is now refusing to even *sell* patriot missile defense systems to Ukraine even though Zelensky is offering 50 billion in cash for them? These defense systems could have saved dozens to hundreds of innocent lives from Russia deliberately striking civilian targets.  It's because he is beholden to Putin and Russia. End of story.",inquisitive_guy_0_1,2025-04-28T08:53:34,3
"But there is evidence. There’s piles and piles and that is not an exaggeration. The reason they’re able to get away with it is that the system was designed around people operating in good faith. The people voted for trump, and that’s why he is office. The population could vote in a literal convicted murderer, and there are no mechanisms to prevent it. There is of course impeachment, but we also saw how wiping your ass with peaceful transition of power doesn’t get you kicked out because the ones who decided his faith were ALSO acting in bad faith. I mean cmon why even say it was a peaceful protest? There’s another obvious lie that they just expect their base to eat up while pissing off the entire world.  And then what happened? Nothing. Because rules and laws don’t matter when the people who are supposed to uphold them don’t. Evidence for everything they do doesn’t matter when trump goes on tv and says the opposite and then Fox runs with it while also making sure you understand that everything dems say is made up and trying to hurt you and your dear leader. Trump supporters live in an alternate reality to the entire world, and that is why evidence doesn’t matter when you have a majority of the voting population.",jmkahn93,2025-04-28T09:41:48,4
