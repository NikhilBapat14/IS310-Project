"Insane that anyone would invite this demented jackass onto their campus, much less give this shithead a podium and a microphone.   Although they clearly wonâ€™t be, the people who extended this offer from the University of Alabama should be ashamed of themselves. What an utter fucking embarrassment this clown is to our country.",Dexx009,2025-05-02T13:19:41,113

How do you make your graduation from college a complete joke? Invite the Worst President in history to be your Commencement Speaker. Talk about a gigantic turd in the punch bowl.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-05-02T13:30:01,37
Remember this was not a commencement ceremony. It was set up after Trump said he was going to speak there. Only Alabama students graduating could get tickets. The school did not ask him to speak. He told them he was going to speak. But of course Trump said he was invited.,Ogdendug,2025-05-02T15:56:12,13

"And I said, you know, a number of times, ""Tariff""â€”it's the most beautiful word in the world. And absolutely decimated by the fake news. They said, ""What about love? What about your wife? What about your parents? What about religion and God?"" So I said, ""All right, it's the fifth nicest word I've ever seen."" And since I've done that, I've been in good shape. Nobody's bothered me. They've been very nice. So it's the fifth most beautiful word I'd ever heard.  But it's making us very rich. And you'll be seeing the results pretty soonâ€”sooner than most people think. Because that's what other countries have been doing to us, just so you understand. They were tariffing the hell out of us. We couldn't sell cars in Europe. We couldn't sell cars in China. We couldn't sell cars in Japan or anywhere else. We couldn't do anything. And all we're doing isâ€”we're doing it to them. But we're doing it much better.",hamiltonisoverrat3d,2025-05-02T14:16:41,9
"Mr. President, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.",docbauies,2025-05-02T15:39:50,16

_Trump's Commencement Speech at the University of Alabama Was a Performance of Complete Lunacy_     Remember this is Alabama we're talking about. A typical commencement speaker is a widely respected scholar and any such speaker would be completely incomprehensible to a University of Alabama graduate.Â Â  In other words they don't expect to understand their commencement speakers. So the fact that Trump didn't make any sense is just what they were expecting.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T13:35:01,3

Had Michelle Obama at my graduation. Was annoyed because they changed the tone after I sent out invitations.
