"Because there were no DOGE savings.  It’s a combination of lying about the amount of money, that not turning over funds that have been allocated by Congress means that the money was somehow saved and other lies and manipulation.  It is terrifying that there are people gullible enough to believe DOGE is saving money.",ButGravityAlwaysWins,2025-05-02T16:39:02,394
"Because there is no savings. They never intended for there to be any. It's just a way to dismantle the federal government, especially everything that FDR and the civil rights era brought us. They want to undo the 20th century.",The_B_Wolf,2025-05-02T16:47:12,81
"They completely lied, psycopathically. The NYT had a great breakdown of how their ""hall of fame"" savings ranking was completely 100% fake, and they had to retract almost all of it.   For a good while their #1 spot was a claim that they saved a BILLION dollars cutting a single program. It was a typo. They cut a single program that cost 1 MILLION.   That's the level of seriousness these people are operating on.   There were no savings, there was never any serious intent to produce any savings. Just a brute force intimidation tactic to threaten everyone by implying that everyone is disposable at any moment, should they anger the president.",BananaResearcher,2025-05-02T18:22:46,50
"Everyone pointing out that DOGE inflated their figures is overlooking the point: funding has indeed been cut for many programs, and people have indeed been fired. Money that was going out is no longer going out. So where is that money?  Only Congress can appropriate money. So even if it is legal for the president to fire employees and arbitrarily cancel outlays, the money that would otherwise go to those salaries, or funding for things like USAID, just sits in the federal account. It was money that was doing something, now it's money that's doing nothing. The only way to return it is for Congress to otherwise appropriate other spending using that money, or to send it back as a rebate to taxpayers. Or for the administration to actually enforce the law as written, and spend the money as appropriated by Congress. Otherwise, that money is left in limbo.  All DOGE has done is removed money from the GDP, and reduced services for everyone. There is nothing gained.",TheOvy,2025-05-02T20:37:54,22

"The goal here is to enshrine a class of oligarchs, not to reduce the budget, debt, or deficit.  DOGE’s job was to strip the biggest expense - people’s salary + benefits - from the balance sheet. Then the remaining assets - the buildings, the equipment, anything that’s not nailed down - will get sold for pennies on the dollar to the same people who have made a shitload of money insider trading on the wild swings over the last month. Then those people either hold those assets or sell them at market prices to other investors.   Lather. Rinse. Repeat.",o_mfg,2025-05-02T17:37:51,21
"There were none.  Trump's base is really uninformed about how government actually works and like a big show.  DOGE was a big, showy action that concealed a massive amount of damage to federal agencies while providing zero to negative savings.  Most experts, at this point, believe that the full cost of DOGE will exceed any potential savings.  Firing that many people can save money, as haphazardly as it was done the actual effects will be to increase corruption and graft to the point where all the saving are gone.    Basically if DOGE were serious they could have saved money, but it looks like the disruption was just cover for certain groups to loot the treasury.",tosser1579,2025-05-03T00:26:04,6

"Musk was going for 1 trillion then raised it to 2 trillion savings! So far he’s done $160 BILLION. Approx 8% of target. However, he’s reduced or eliminated over 10 agencies that were limiting his businesses. He took care of himself.",1billmcg,2025-05-02T17:57:43,7

It was about providing cover for Muskrat to fire all the people investigating and penalizing his businesses for wrongdoing, and also to scoop up some more lucrative government contracts along the way.

They're not making it permanent because it doesn't exist. The DOGE project was about political loyalty plus consolidating and removing all the information the Federal government has on Americans in order to gift it to private (also Russian) hands.,ThePensiveE,2025-05-04T07:51:29,3

"People need to understand the ICA first, that is the Impound Control Act. DOGE recommended a bunch of cuts.  This may be cancelled contracts, but the executive branch still needs to spend the money unless Congress codifies the cut in a certain amount of time.   You all should have hoped that DOGE found a lot of waste, fraud and abuse.  Because the federal government has spent itself out of existence.  It just takes a long time to bleed out, and the treatment to save us is too severe to consider.  Look at the latest Penn-Wharton budget/debt model, we have less than 20 years, much less depending on the next war we fund, recession, or pandemic.  Penn-Wharton are recommending severe taxes to keep us going, along with cuts and rapid growth.   Right now we can do something, but we think we are  ""we are too big to fail"", and by the time they start it will be too late.  Why do you think Trump is angry at the Fed for not reducing interest rates?",kenmele,2025-05-03T14:36:48,1
"The irony practically drips off this post. After all the chest-pounding, the press conferences, the corporate buzzword-laced “disruption,” and Elon Musk’s scorched-earth ego trip through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), what do we have to show for it? A big fat nothing. No budget impact. No actual savings. No codified policy. Just a pile of confusion, institutional damage, and enough bad faith PR to fill a Tesla factory.  Republicans spent months praising Musk’s radical “cost-saving” measures at DOGE like they were gospel, treating his slash-and-burn tactics as if he’d reinvented the wheel, never mind the fact that most of the “savings” weren’t even legally binding. As Robert Shea points out, without Congress codifying these cuts, they don’t exist in any meaningful or enforceable way. It’s all political theater, screaming about belt-tightening while still buying Gucci for the 1%.  The real reason Congress won’t codify the cuts? Because even they know they’re not sustainable, strategic, or even particularly functional. Slashing staffing, gutting operations, and arbitrarily axing programs looks great to a soundbite-hungry base, but when it comes time to govern—when the lights need to stay on and services need to be delivered, reality hits like a budget deadline. It’s easier to let Elon play cowboy than to actually legislate the wreckage he leaves behind.  Meanwhile, the same GOP lawmakers who claim we can’t afford meals for low-income kids or student debt relief are tripping over themselves to make the Trump-era tax cuts for billionaires permanent. So let’s get this straight: we can’t codify savings from DOGE because they’re too risky or controversial, but we can lock in tax breaks for people who have private jets and Cayman Islands accountants?  This is where the whole charade breaks down. If these cuts were so effective, where’s the legislation? Where’s the conservative courage to put pen to paper and make it law? They’ll shout from the rooftops that they’re slashing waste, but when it’s time to show their math, they vanish behind a smokescreen of slogans and scapegoats.  And let’s not forget the human cost. Behind every “cut” is a real-life consequence, fewer inspections, slower services, and overburdened civil servants. But sure, keep celebrating fictional savings while the machine breaks down from neglect.  So let’s ask the obvious: 	1.	If Musk’s DOGE cuts are so fiscally responsible, why won’t Congress make them permanent?  	2.	If Republicans are serious about the debt, why are tax breaks for the wealthy always a priority?  	3.	And if these budget “savings” aren’t real until Congress acts, isn’t the whole narrative just a politically convenient lie? r/politicalsham",Chance-Evening-4141,2025-05-06T15:16:10,1
Because it is a proposal written without consulting DOGE.  And congress can double or triple the budget if they want. They can also act completely independent of the president when drafting the budget.,Far_Realm_Sage,2025-05-02T19:28:18,0

And now Trump is telling people kids will have to have less toys and you'll basically have to learn to love to be poor.

"DOGE is entirely illegal, it requires an act of Congress to rename the USDS and change its scope and duties.  An agency of the executive cant cut spending or lay off Federal workers of other agencies.  And the President cant cut spending arbitrarily, the President can only fire his executive officers with some limited exceptions...He cant lay off Federal workers en masse.  Trump illegally cut spending and illegally fired Federal workers which he will use as an excuse to gut government spending.  The cuts primarily targeted at social programs increase cost of living for the majority of Americans.  We live in a consumer economy, one of the reasons SNAPS is so effective, is due to it boosting the U.S. economy along with helping people on the bottom.  Which reduces crime and poverty.  One dollar spent on SNAPS returns with 1.50 to 1.80 in economic activity.  Propping up the bottom benefits the entire country financially, it increases jobs.  But SNAPS is always the first thing Republicans want to destroy.  The cuts by DOGE are creating massive deficits.  Not to mention putting peoples personal and private information at risk of being stolen, used for A.I., used to purge the next election of legal voters, etc...  DOGE gaining access to social security the treasury, they are likely looking to loot funds from these programs and departments, there is zero oversight, and again their actions are criminal.  DOGE is the bureaucracy and fraud they claim to be targeting.  They are increasing costs for American citizens.  And no one has really attempted to stop them.  Its a pro-longed coup of the United States government.  The U.S. already has the GAO which does everything Trump and Elon Musk were saying DOGE is doing.  Republicans hate the GAO because it brings to light the inconvenient realities of Republican administrations.

"That is the topic of the next Constitutional crisis.  https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/the-white-houses-next-orchestrated-budget-crisis  > The White House apparently wants to essentially create a crisis around what to do with that pile of money and force Democrats either to allow them to pass or actually support passing what’s called a rescission bill. A rescission bill is when money piles up like this, Congress realizes it appropriated too much money, so it votes to take the money back. In this case, you get Democrats to sort of rubber stamp or own all those NIH biomedical research cuts. Now why would Democrats do that? As this was originally presented to me, it’s framed as a kind of constitutional crisis. If we don’t spend this money, we’re violating the Constitution. By this time we have maybe two weeks left in the fiscal year so it’s not possible to spend it even if you wanted to. So the White House says, if you don’t help us you’ll be forcing us to violate the Constitution.  > As I told the people I discussed this with, the logic here didn’t make a lot of sense to me. But I think the idea is slightly different. Either Democrats help the White House keep the whole thing in constitutional bounds or it becomes de facto impoundment of those funds and in essence impoundment becomes the law of the land by force of action if not legal review.
