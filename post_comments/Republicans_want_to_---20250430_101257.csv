That’s why we’re getting proposals like this. Note this isn’t new, some states already do exactly this. I know WA implemented increased registration fees for EVs and hybrids before I left. And for the same reason.  I'm in Ohio and they've done the same. I think it's $200 for EVs and $100 for hybrids. My issues are:  * The flat hybrid/ev tax isn't fair. If two people have the same EV, one puts 30k miles on the road a year, the other only puts 5k, why should they both pay the same ""road taxes"". * If you have 3 same/similar vehicles, but one is ICE, one is hybrid, one is EV, they should all pay the same tax/per mile, but they won't. * People with older ICE vehicles (and thus typically less efficient) will pay more taxes per miles than those with newer (more efficient) vehicles. This generally impacts the poor more.  * That can lead to situations where a newer larger heavier vehicle that's more fuel efficient puts more wear and tear on the roads than an older smaller lighter vehicle that's not as efficient, however the newer vehicle pays less in taxes despite causing more wear.   Basically, I think road taxes should be more in line with usage, and I feel a mileage tax would be fairer and more proportional than gas and flat taxes. Yes I also acknowledge the above issue, plus city miles causes more wear than highway miles but would be taxed the same, and some other issues.   > Not saying I support it.

Every state I have lived in has required annual safety inspections for vehicle registration. Simply record the mileage as part of the inspection and file it. No other spot checks needed.,Unshkblefaith,2025-04-30T11:18:35,1
"In the state I live in there is already a yearly tax on EVs collected by the state. It is unfair to the average driver (and well beyond the average driver).   I have a Chevy Volt which can run on gas in addition to being charged up. The tax is the same as if it were a pure electric car.    However, unlike electric only EVs where you need to make assumptions to figure out how much gas tax they are equivalent to, you can figure out exactly what it is with the Volt because you can just run it on gas and find out what your real gas mileage is and work out how much gas tax would be collected based on the miles you drive.    So I did that and found that I would need to drive 28000 miles per year on gas for the gas tax to equal the ev tax. You get extra cheated with a car like this because you have to pay the ev tax when you renew the registration, and the amount of driving you do on gas makes no difference.    This federal tax would be on top of what's already there, making it so I'd need to drive more than 50k per year for it to be equal. ",hardtobeuniqueuser,2025-04-30T12:33:15,2
"> Isn’t that what’s already happening in a practical sense with taxes applied to gasoline? EVs are not subject to that tax that funds the roads, despite also providing wear and tear.   Yes, but again see my notes on why I do not find it fair. Here's an explanation:   * Car A, ICE, 25 years old, weighs 3000 pounds, gets 25 mpg * Car B, ICE, brand new, weighs 3000 pounds, gets 35 mpg * Car C, Hybrid, brand new, weighs 3000 pounds, gets 45 mpg * Car D, EV, brand new, weighs 3000 pounds, no gas.   If each of those cars go 10,000 miles in a year (and lets say it's all equal driving as well, same exact mix of city and highway), what's a fair amount they should pay in ""gas"" taxes?   In Ohio:  * Car A pays $154.00 * Car B pays $110.00 * Car C pays $185.56 * Car D pays $200.00  (10K miles / mpg * Ohio's $0.385 per gallon gas tax, + hybrids have a $100 registration fee, EVs have a $200 registration fee).   I believe they should all pay the same since they all put equal wear and tear on the roads. But car A is punished for being less efficient (and this will impact the poor more since they don't buy newer/more expensive vehicles). Cars C and D are punished for being electric.   Now let's say they drive a lot, 30,000 miles a year:  * Car A pays $462.00 * Car B pays $330.00 * Car C pays $356.67  * Car D pays $200.00  Now car A is REALLY punished, B and C aren't too bad, but still unfair for C, and D is loving it.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-04-30T12:11:47,2
"The conventional wisdom that commercial trucks are destroying streets and highways has been around for a long time but how true is that really. I know that anecdotal evidence doesn’t carry any weight but these two make me have my doubts. When I was a kid growing up in Queens, we used the Belt Parkway a lot from the area of JFK to the Verrazano Bridge. Nearly every trip along that route also involved driving the NJ Turnpike from Elizabeth @ Exit 13 to the Delaware Memorial Bridge and further down I-95. Throughout the 1960’s and 70’s, the Belt was a potholed mess. Like something out of a war zone. Coupled with it being constructed through swampland, and the road having rises and dips, it was a roller coaster ride. Note that as a NYC parkway, there was no commercial traffic allowed. The lane width, grades, bridge clearances and ramps simply are not and still are not up to it. Contrast that with the NJ Turnpike which at six lanes in each direction carries all north-south traffic along the eastern seaboard. Three of those lanes are separated and designated for trucks. And the road was always smooth. I believe this is due to it being properly designed, constructed and maintained for its use. Today, the Northern State Parkway on Long Island, which is also limited to passenger vehicles, develops into a potholed mess every few years, seeing repaving only ahead of election years.",RedditReader4031,2025-04-30T10:53:03,-1
"The biggest problem with taxing mileage and weight is that it will disproportionally affect poorer communities. Typically, they have to drive further to work and more often.
