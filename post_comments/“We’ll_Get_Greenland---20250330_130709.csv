"Americans, as a European with 20 years of experience in military intelligence and diplomacy, I must tell you: everything that’s unfolded since this man became president is a direct attack on your Constitution, human rights, and the progress humanity has made. You may be facing your own crises, but if this continues, we’re heading straight for World War III. Multiple pandemics, economic downfall, and global chaos await. The world works in domino effects—one wrong move can set off catastrophic events. The time to act is now, or humanity as a whole will lose.  I don’t want to intimidate anyone or engage in fear-mongering, but in 2025, we should be eradicating cancer, not canceling cancer research. We should be protecting our planet, not on the verge of nuclear war. We should respect every nation, color, creed, and orientation, not erase them from history books. And we certainly should not be fighting our neighbors.",pianoavengers,2025-03-30T13:28:57,263
