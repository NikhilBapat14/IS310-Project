"The idea is liberal capitalist democracy is the form of government towards which all states will naturally converge.  This isn’t really the end for Fukuyama though. The last chapter of The End of History, “The Last Man” (and the title of his next book, “The End of History and The Last Man”) is a reference to Nietzsche’s [The Last Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man) a kind of anti-Ubermench who becomes afflicted with nihilism in a materially abundant technocratic society. He sees this “end of history” leading to a great spiritual restlessness and dissatisfaction.  Quite a lot of people have criticized Fukuyama since the 1990s. I think the strongest criticism is showing how capitalism in China and Russia did not lead inevitably towards democracy — perhaps it had the opposite affect, where too much of an emphasis on free market capitalism worked against democratic progress.  But Fukuyama has become much less neoconservative and much more socialist over the years. His conception of liberal democracy in his latest book, Liberalism and it’s Discontents, fits more with the worldview of Corbyn and Sanders than Friedman and Rumsfeld.   I think a lot of the current leftist critiques of Fukuyama come from misunderstandings. Yes, capitalism perhaps led China and Russia away from Democracy, but I think most leftists would argue this has made them less stable countries, and they would be better served by being more democratic and more socialist (in Fukuyama’s terminology, more classically liberal and less neoliberal.)",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-12-12T08:58:26,1
