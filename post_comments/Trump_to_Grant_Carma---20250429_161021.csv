Here NYT. Let us fix your dumb fucking headline:  Trump to Grant Carmakers Some Relief From His OWN Punishing Tariffs.,williamgman,2025-04-29T16:41:08,11
Trump to partially address problem he created. ,NickelBackwash,2025-04-29T16:34:46,5

The lack of stability in policy making will keep America and the world in an uncertain state until he is removed from office.,YesterShill,2025-04-29T16:46:53,5

"“The changes will modify Mr. Trump’s tariffs so that carmakers who pay a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, for example on steel and aluminum, officials said in a call with reporters Tuesday.”",Lantis28,2025-04-29T16:11:18,3
