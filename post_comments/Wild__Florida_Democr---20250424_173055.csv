"This is a big deal. To have the minority leader in the Florida Senate throw in the towel and leave his party is a testament to just how broken the Democrats are in the state. Gov. Ron DeSantis, despite the best efforts of RINOs in the legislature who have fought him tooth and nail to serve their special interests, has thoroughly exiled left-wing opposition in Florida and left people like Nikki Fried, who heads the Democratic state party, coping and seething.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T17:43:15,15
"Sounds good, but the author made a valid point at the end of the column.  Rinos in the Florida legislature are not in unison with DeSantis.    Florida needs to wake up and primary these bozos out.",luderiffic,2025-04-24T21:56:23,3
"Florida has term limits, and you can't do more than two terms in a row in the state Senate. Functionally this is equivelant to ""you can't kick me out of the club, I quit!"".",LKincheloe,2025-04-24T18:09:43,3
