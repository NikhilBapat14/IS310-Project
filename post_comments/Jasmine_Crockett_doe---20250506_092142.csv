"I think she is smart, but knows that she needs to play a role to get get her fame. I wonder how it feels to have to act like a moron to get elected in the democratic party.   But to be fair, I'm not sure what's worse, acting stupid, or not being sure about the person. That's where I am on MTG.",LeeroyJenkins11,2025-05-06T09:48:40,1

"I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs smart at all, I l think she‚Äôs a loudmouth the media is latching onto.  They get people who like her to click, and they get people who can‚Äôt believe the crazy shit she just said to click.  Same with AOC.    They‚Äôre both useful idiots.",cliffotn,2025-05-06T11:16:22,7
"I don‚Äôt know if she is smart but I will giver her more credit than others may. In the past, she actually presented herself more professionally but I guess she decided to go with a new persona so that she can be more relatable or to get more attention.",Icant_concentrate,2025-05-06T16:33:20,2
"Maybe smart is strong, but she isn't the idiot she portrays herself to be. https://youtu.be/apr1HJ9er04?si=2p9UkW4vANcJUK7d&t=128  AOC is what I would expect from a NYU student who became a bartender.",LeeroyJenkins11,2025-05-06T12:14:58,2
