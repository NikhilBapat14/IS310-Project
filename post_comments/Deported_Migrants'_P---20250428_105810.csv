Notice they aren’t putting the photos of the children they’ve deported or the people with no criminal record. This is all propaganda.,Darth_Vrandon,2025-04-28T11:05:44,94

"Honestly, it's deeply disturbing to see this kind of tactic employed, especially when considering how easily narratives can be manipulated, and the potential for harm to those already vulnerable, because I just don't trust that this presentation offers a fair depiction of the facts, it's all rather concerning, wouldn't you agree?",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-28T11:01:39,24

"I grew up in rural Louisiana.  This is top-shelf trashy behavior.  Like, this could only be worse if they also put a Camaro Iroc with a botched tinted window job on the front lawn.",KronkLaSworda,2025-04-28T11:29:56,16
"If they’ve committed these crimes then they should be arrested, charged, tried and imprisoned, and then deported. If they’ve simply been deported then you have to ask yourself where is the justice in that. This is not just because of the retribution, but also the victim’s of these crimes need closure and a simple deportation doesn’t solve that. For those that say why do we have to pay to incarcerate them, there are approximately 2 million Americans already locked up and we seem to have no problem with that.",johnn48,2025-04-28T11:44:59,3

"I wonder how far back and wide their net must be to get all these cases? And I wonder, how do they know what each of them did? Did they…. Dare I say it…. Get due process?

It's not even just people with criminal records. Some of these people just have been accused of the crime but have been denied due process and therefore have not been convicted of anything.,Deinosoar,2025-04-28T11:07:50,39
"You'll notice that actual sources of journalism are censoring the photos on the signs. This is because the crimes these individuals are supposedly ""guilty"" of (no due process) cannot be confirmed. This is straight-up propaganda coming from the White House.",Predator_,2025-04-28T12:09:08,29

"That is not what happened. If you are 100% convinced that all of these people are actually guilty of what the government accuses them off, then why do you support denying them to due process that would allow them to be convicted?  And if you are okay with denying people due process because they were accused of a crime, then we'll keep that in mind in case you are ever accused of a crime. We will be sure to remind everybody that you think due process is stupid and you don't want that for yourself.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T11:07:21,12

"Among the people sean, some of them actually have criminal convictions, but many of them were just accused of crimes but have no conviction. So yes, by the very fucking definition of how words work that means that they are not yet criminals. No more so than anyone else accused of a crime who hasn't been found guilty.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T11:12:17,12
"Funny thing, when you don't give a person due process, we'll never know. There is a regular process the administration refused to use, and they refused to use it because then the people they want to deport would be allowed to defend them selves. Why would you be afraid of a criminal being able to stand in court and have the judge deport them? If it's the number of judges, you're in luck. Just appoint more.",jazzmaster_jedi,2025-04-28T11:36:55,2
"It doesn't matter if they were actually criminals or not.  What matter is Due Process.  If you deport ""criminals"" but don't bother with a trial, then you aren't being tough on crime.

And I heard somewhere that if somebody actively argues in support of Nazi shit that is because that person is a goddamn nazi.  And you are one Nazi that will never waste another fucking second of my time.,Deinosoar,2025-04-28T11:18:10,13
"You were saying this would make crime go down. I was pointing out how this was nonsense because deporting undocumented criminals is what has always happened. Ergo, no possible impact on crime rates.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-28T11:37:53,5
