"Meanwhile her citizens are being disappeared and murdered by the tens of thousands, due to her out of control cartels and gangs.  What a great use of her time and her country’s resources.  That money would be better spent on a program like El Salvador introduced, to tackle actual crime and societal decline.",CommonSenseAgent,2025-05-10T07:18:13,100
Didn't they only change how it appears to users in the US? What grounds does she have to sue when the change hasn't even affected her country and is in a language foreign to them? Will Mexico sue over the body of water being named differently in foreign languages?,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-10T10:29:46,45

This should be good.  What’s the cause of action?  ,j3remy2007,2025-05-10T05:36:44,35
"Because it's more than a name and could be used to facilitate a territorial claim someday, hence why the country who shares its namesake is suing over it. This only highlights why it was a good decision to rename it.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T07:59:46,20
"""Gulf of the Americas"" could be the best nomenclature for that aim, in my opinion.",IVot3dforKodos,2025-05-10T10:22:59,33

How could it be used to facilitate a territorial claim? My understanding was that under international maritime law countries’ ocean borders only extend 11 miles offshore and that basically every major nation except for China accepts that.,MulticamTropic,2025-05-10T08:24:36,33

"The same way Putin concocted a story about ""Ukraine"" being a made up thing to invade it. Challenges to maritime law and territorial disputes involving it aren't unheard of. If the name of the area had no value, no one would be suing over it. It should tell you something that even in your question you have to acknowledge that a major superpower has opted not to accept the status quo, because it's just that, until it isn't. We'd be foolish not to acknowledge the folly of the South China Sea nomenclature.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T08:38:06,10
South China Sea is a very apt comparison and makes Trumps reasoning for doing this much clearer to me,TheYoungLung,2025-05-10T09:11:35,7
