The testimony of Christine Blasey Ford in Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation was a landmark moment. Kavanaugh himself arguably blew his cool in those hearings too.,perfectlyhydrated,2023-03-24T23:15:35,33

"[May I present the Peter Strzok hearing recapped by Stephen Colbert](https://youtu.be/siYIEmHOvDU)  Filled with drama and congress people behaving badly. Yes, it's a non-serious presentation of the hearing, but all the good stuff is in there and it is some of Colbert's finest work. I still go back to watch this years later.",femputer1,2023-03-25T08:33:37,4
The exchange between Candace Owens and congressman Ted Lieu is a good one. Showing how often the left takes things out of context to drive certain narratives.,Silly_Ad2805,2023-03-29T00:37:10,1
"There was a really good podcast episode at some point that did a deep dive on the impact of the launch of C-SPAN and the expanded live media spotlight of political drama. I can't for the life of me remember what it was so if someone else remembers...  But the short of it was that C-SPAN and related ""gavel-to-gavel"" coverage of Congress was meant to increase transparency into the halls of Congress and government at-large. This started really ramping up (including the launch of C-SPAN) in the aftermath of Watergate and increased scrutiny and interest from the public in what is happening in Washington and calls for transparency, and also came alongside the ramp up of more general entertainment.   And while transparency is great, the media spotlight on basically every waking moment of Congress turned it into a bit of an entertainment spectacle of its own. That's not entirely new. Government has long included politicians needing to creating flashy moments or big headlines has been a part of democracy almost from the start. But this was a whole different animal and meant basically every moment was now a spectacle and increasingly, that meant even the traditionally 'heads-down, pencil-to-paper, shop talk meetings' were now also for public consumption. Which drove basically every moment to be a press conference.   Which meant more drama, more flash, more spectacle.",PhiloPhocion,2023-03-31T07:45:46,1
"Arguably? The man was openly crying and blabbering about how he likes beer. I'm a firm believer in innocent until proven guilty, but his behavior would be incredibly bizarre if he were completely innocent.",blaqsupaman,2023-03-25T00:35:43,22
His behavior alone should have disqualified him.  Who wants such a blathering fool deciding on the lives of all of us?,bjdevar25,2023-03-25T07:59:43,12

"Exactly. Even the fact that he's so easily provoked into reacting like that is alarming. If he was innocent (major eye roll), it would be upsetting to be accused, but most people would take a break from talking about PJ, Squee, and his love of calenders and pull himself together.",whatsasimba,2023-03-25T13:23:26,3
