"Republicans don’t want the clever to breed, because intelligent people don’t vote Republican.   What Republicans want is a steady flow of desperate uneducated wage slaves to fuel the beast of perpetual quarterly growth.",bestforward121,2025-05-04T08:53:55,131
It’s very telling that they include themselves in the frame of “clever”.   Based on intelligence much of their blood lines would end.,leontes,2025-05-04T08:54:18,58

">Enter Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US secretary of health, who regularly laments over the “back then” of his youth when he says that diabetes and autism was almost unheard of and obesity rates were far lower.  Yes, back then, when his aunt was lobotomized, oh my heart, it was SOOO much better. \*shaking my head\* (obviously sarcasm).   Today it is believed that Rosemary Kennedy had autism caused by a brain injury during birth (lack of oxygen). Yet another undiagnosed case of autism. How can this man not realize that the rise in autism rates is largely due to advances in medicine leading to higher awareness and better diagnostics? The level of absolute stupidity exhibited by the giant orange turd's administration baffles my mind. I can't begin to comprehend the complete lack of critical thinking skills these people show on a daily basis.",SatoriFound,2025-05-04T09:57:58,21

The people calling everyone else “sheeple” are the ones that want livestock medication and herd immunity.  Meanwhile these idiots only seem immune to being smart.,LuvKrahft,2025-05-04T08:59:08,11
"And of course, they get to decide who is ""clever"". Like the real state hustler who went bankrupt several times, or the guy who just reduced Tesla's value to its half.",Ramoncin,2025-05-04T11:47:52,5
"Ok tell me what skyrocketing student loans were supposed to be, other than a way to limit Smart Poors from creating generational progress. This soft eugenics has been a thing for a long time.",Smooth_Influence_488,2025-05-04T12:06:56,5
"“Clever” people are not necessarily healthy or physically superior. See Stephen Hawkings.   Smart people don’t necessarily beget smart people and dumb people don’t necessarily beget dumb people, because intelligence genetics is wildly complex.   Musk himself is smart in a fairly common way. He’s a nerdy sci-fi fan who can code a little. Like 90% of Reddit. He isn’t a genius and since we can see his whole soul due to his incessant shitposting, is dumber than average about things that don’t relate to business or tech.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-04T14:03:43,5

"I mean, it is an interesting idea: what if he's not just crazy and letting kids get measles, but is doing it intentionally to ""cull the herd"" so to speak.  Also, anyone thinks they're super smart or fit and they should be having more babies to save the human race are probably the last people that should be having any kids at all.",LockNo2943,2025-05-04T13:55:22,5

"Trump and his administration aren't alone in this. Our entire ruling class, Mr. Biden and his ghouls included, have worked to push us into this era of ""soft eugenics.""  Choosing to normalize an ongoing pandemic to prioritize profit is eugenics. Its was a decision to discontinue protections and programs. It was a decision to make the world a more dangerous place for the elderly and the immunocompromised. It was a decision to place nearly everyone, including children, at risk of long-term illness and complications due to repeat Covid-19 infections.  Negligence isn't inevitable. This level of disregard for basic humanity isn't inevitable. This is all the product of a sociopathic system called capitalism--a system that prioritizes the few at the expense of the many.  While Trump and his administration's cruelty may shock us, understand that he is not unique. His actions resemble those of our more ""moderate"" politicians and bureaucrats. The shock comes from the degree of action and the lack of obfuscation.",TalesOfFan,2025-05-05T12:22:58,2
"This is just messed up thinking, honestly. That kind of mindset never ends well and ignores all the stuff we know about genetics and how society works. People aren’t video game characters with clever stats you can just breed for. Also, nobody gets to decide who’s weak”or clever. Thats not how life works.",SunKissedLadie,2025-05-04T08:58:09,2
"MAGA followers like to screw the weak thinking they are strong. Some of them are but most of them aren't. And for those who are strong but not among them, they will find other reasons to hate them (e.g. we are little people and those are elitists)   The enemy is too strong and too weak at the same time ",EmployAltruistic647,2025-05-04T14:23:27,1

"The clever?  No, the dumb and insulated by wealth get to breed.  This never works. There is no form of this type of organization of society that doesn’t result in bloody rebellion.  It’s simple, no matter how special/talented or “anointed” or whatever people, NO ONE should have a grotesque amount more than everyone else. The more it tilts in that direction, the less the people who endure the iniquity have to lose, until they upend the thing.",amanam0ngb0ts,2025-05-04T16:15:05,1

"Fact.  Both Trump and Musk come from wealthy families.  It doesn't take brains to be born rich.  All you have to do is rip off someone else's ideas and throw your money behind it and claim ""I did this, I'm a genius"".  Also, no thanks on having kids in this kind of nation. I wouldn't allow myself to ever reproduce just to have my children be set up as slaves to a cruel system like this. ",arilupe,2025-05-04T09:00:10,27
"In my line of work we having a saying that's something like, ""A smart solution is good. A clever solution means someone's going to have an unpleasant surprise down the road. ""Clever solutions"" often result in outbursts of ""Who is the dumb fucker who designed and implemented this!?"" followed by a humbled ""Oh, I was the person who did this years ago"" a little later on.

"I hope we are discovering now just how batshit crazy and cruel the Kennedys are, after America has worshipped them for over 60 years. What they did to Rose is horrible and once she was in a home, the family rarely visited her. They left her behind as an abhorred object to scorn rather than respecting her for the human being she was. Right out of a conservative playbook.  ETA: I guess I need to give credit to Eunice Kennedy for taking her sister’s experience and doing good with it on behalf of disabled people. It’s sad to see the right tearing it down.",AlllliillllA,2025-05-04T16:08:12,4

"That's what these people want, to bring us back to those times. When if your woman talked back you could lock her up in an asylum by saying she was ""hysterical"". They reduce us to our basest emotions, and because they (the men) don't act that way, there must be something wrong with us when we express our feelings, when we question them, when we cry for fuck's sake.  They took every bit of Rose's vibrancy, they turned off her lights, because they thought she 'misbehaved'. They had enough data to see what happened to someone after you inserted an ice pick through their eye socket. They thought having a zombie was preferable to impulsive behavior, to emotions. \*sigh\*  RFK is sooo delusional. Of course Diabetes is more prevalent, we have an obesity issue. That's the only thing he is right about. The processed food, the fast food, is killing us. But one right does not fix the fact that he is NOT a medical doctor and has no right to be in his position, that he has NO right to make health proclamations to the entirety of this country.",SatoriFound,2025-05-04T18:49:59,5
