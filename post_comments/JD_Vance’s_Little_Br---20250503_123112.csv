It’s probably hard to communicate effectively when big bro already ate all the crayons,yuanshaosvassal,2025-05-03T12:36:39,133
"Ah, so I see this is generational thing and not Vance himself. Perhaps way back in ye olden days, grandpa Vance pissed off a witch, and the males were cursed for eternity to be disliked by everyone.",Disastrous-Yam-7073,2025-05-03T12:39:03,39

"It's a cash grab. He won't win, won't spend any PAC money, just have the bribes to his brother flow through him.",Zealousideal-Fun3917,2025-05-03T13:44:48,5

"JD - “C’mon man, it’s easy. Just agree with everything trump says and they pay you for it. You might have to act like a psycho a little bit and lose all credibility, but it’s worth it.”",Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-03T13:23:04,5

He has no chance. He still on his first name.,Impossible-Owl-66,2025-05-03T15:51:27,3
Shoulda done a play for the other team as a “fuck you” to JD and he’d have been wildly more popular just for the controversy. Could’ve turned it into a TLC reality show like 1000lb sisters or something going between the two jerk offs.,bonorumemalorum,2025-05-03T15:57:37,3
OK. I gotta ask. What is up with his beard?,disasterbot,2025-05-03T13:00:29,5

Unless he’s 7 it’s “younger” and not “little”. He’s not 7.  I just think this is an odd Americanism.,Gloobloomoo,2025-05-03T22:29:08,1
