"ChatGPT: Using the belt buckle as a scale reference can help us tighten up the estimate a bit. A standard belt buckle is typically around 2 inches (5 cm) wide, and in the image, the buckle appears to span a relatively small portion of the man's torso compared to his overall frame. By comparing that ratio visually, we can make some educated guesses.  Assuming the buckle is about 2 inches, it looks like approximately 9 to 10 belt buckle widths could span his height from head to toe. That would suggest a height in the range of 5'10"" to 6'0"" (178‚Äì183 cm), likely closer to 6'0"" when accounting for posture and camera angle.  Looking at his proportions, particularly the width of his torso and the way his pants fit high on his waist, it's clear that he's carrying significant weight. His build suggests a large frame with considerable mass concentrated in the midsection. Based on that and the visual width comparison to the buckle, his weight likely falls between 280 and 310 lbs (127‚Äì141 kg).",CaptainJackSorrow,2025-04-14T12:35:44,1

Then there is the fact he isn't 6'4"" either. He wears shoe lifts. That's why he looks like he is about to tip over all the time.  When Trump dies, there will be a problem. There aren't any caskets oversized enough for his massive bulk, and even if there were, there is no way pallbearers could lift that damn casket. Fortunately, there is an easy solution. Give him an enema, and he can be buried in a shoebox.  Ugh, now I have to think about that animated pile of shit being interred in Arlington National Cemetery.

If they're actually playing golf (as opposed to riding around in a golf cart and not doing anything else except for a 5 second exertion from the cart to swing) then it's a really good way for old people to stay physically active.

"When I first started IF, it kinda freaked me out because I basically did only one thing differently.  I had been taking a med before bedtime with a not full glass of milk. I changed that to water. Within a couple of weeks, weight starting coming off. I eventually lost 25 lbs, basically from not drinking a glass of milk at bedtime.  I was totally floored by this. I mean...WTF? All that from a glass of milk?  That was 8 years ago. I still fast as I just feel better. But I do take about 2 breaks a week. If you don't,  your body just adapts, and weight loss stops. I don't really worry about calories but don't overeat except once in a while.  I usually fast about 14 or 15 hours. I also exercise but nothing extreme.    Anyway, hope this info is helpful to anyone thinking about weight loss and IF.  Best of luck!!!",OSDBU2000,2025-04-14T15:06:19,2
