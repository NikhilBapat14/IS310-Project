"Haley would never be able to win the GOP primary. The GOP is now the Trump party, and Haley is persona non grata for Trump allies. Haley should probably be the exact kind of person the GOP is promoting as a future president to get them back on track, but she's not going to be able to get past the Trump sycophants.  I don't think Harris would be able to win a Democrat primary either. She stands a better chance than Haley would, but I lean towards her losing that as well. There's going to be a big culture of fear in the Democratic Party in regards to 2028 in the same way there was in 2020, and a Biden-type is probably going to be who the party goes for. Or just a straight white guy in general who seems to be a ""safe"" pick. I'm not entirely sure she will run anyways, it'd be an embarrassing end to her career to lose a presidential primary and she may rather go out as California governor and the first black woman to be a governor rather than risking another presidential bid which seems more likely to be unsuccessful than successful.",lionhearted318,2025-05-10T19:09:36,1
*Both* parties running a candidate of an unacceptable gender and an unacceptable race? I would tune in for that show.,ditchdiggergirl,2025-05-10T19:40:17,1
"Harris has zero chance of being the nominee in 2028 - although I'm sure some people will do the remind me bot and bring it up to me roughly 3 years from now if she is.  But no, seriously: Her first campaign in 2020 was a total bust. She didn't even make it to the primaries. She got the VP gig basically because the sentiment in the country at the time gave Biden little choice but to pick a minority woman. She didn't do shit as VP and ended up the nominee because Biden dropped out too late to allow any type of primary season and she was the only one to have access to that entire war chest of funding from the party. And then her campaign was basically just a vibe, and then she lost to Trump (convincingly) who should've been a lay up opponent to defeat. So now she's all of the above plus a loser. People don't like losers, except for Trump obviously.  Haley has a better chance, but it's only realistic if Trump's economic policies plunge this country into absolute turmoil (which may happen), and even then, never underestimate the power of those media outlets to spin it into ""it's actually the Democrats' faults"" and have his moronic followers fully believe it.",runninhillbilly,2025-05-10T19:26:31,1
"/thread, honestly.  It would be a shock for either to win their primary at this point, much less both.",Hartastic,2025-05-10T19:22:23,1
"Agreed. I'd actually be stunned if both win, I feel the chances of that happening are near zero considering neither should be considered favorites to win as is, especially not Haley. The most realistic outcome is probably something like Vance vs. Newsom imo.",lionhearted318,2025-05-10T19:25:19,1
