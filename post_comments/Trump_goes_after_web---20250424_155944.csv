Isn't this guy encouraging people to send him anonymous money for his scam coin to maybe get to have dinner with him if they have millions of dollars worth?,obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-24T16:03:36,10
Wow they are morons.  I just setup a recurring donation with ActBlue. Hope a flood of others do too.,[deleted],2025-04-24T17:06:23,6
"Donald Trump will sign an executive order that will target online election fundraising platforms that may allegedly process foreign campaign donations – an action specifically aimed at curtailing the activities of ActBlue, the primary online fundraising platform for the Democratic Party.  Politico first reported that the executive order was imminent, was aimed at launching an investigation into ActBlue, and would involve Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department. NBC confirmed the report shortly after, saying that the order was related to “how the platform verifies and reports its donors and users.”  The move comes after months of House Republicans demanding evidence from ActBlue that demonstrated it was able to prevent donations from foreign actors, an accusation ActBlue has vehemently and repeatedly denied.

> MAGA scrutiny of ActBlue went viral in March after Elon Musk accused ActBlue-linked groups of secretly funding the protests taking place at Tesla dealerships across the country.
