It's what America voted for.  No one does destruction and disaster like Trump...,Troubled202,2025-04-28T09:28:09,10
"FEMA’s elimination this month of the BRIC program revoked upwards of [$3.6 billion in funding](https://fema.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/8812b5926abd408cbb340b2159b98732) earmarked for communities like Mount Pleasant. Though President Donald Trump has openly questioned whether to shutter FEMA completely, local officials said they were blindsided by the move to end BRIC, established during the Republican president’s first term.     The loss of all this money is going to have a profound impact on many poor, rural, and elderly people.",Smithy2232,2025-04-28T09:13:06,5
"The left/right conflict is always about the American Caste System.The left wants to flatten it and the right wants to strictly enforce it. We need to learn to talk about it directly because it is the Rosetta Stone that explains the GOP's intentions and actions. Here are its dimensions.  RACE RULE: White people above all others. Black people below all others.  SEX RULE: Men above women.  SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IDENTITY RULE: All cis/het people above all LGBTQ people.  **This attack is about: CLASS RULE: Owning class above working class above the poor.**  CHRISTIAN MEMBERSHIP RULE: Old Testament above New Testament. People proclaiming Christian membership have the right to judge and smite others. And their actions are inherently righteous because of their membership.  DIS/ABILITY RULE: The able have no responsibility to accommodate, support, or include people with mental and physical disabilities.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-28T09:15:49,5
