"Thrasybulus, Tyrant of Miletus.  Any despotic regime with a Cult of Personality **infallibly** descends into abysmal corruption & ineptitude.  Only those who are incompetent or ineffectual ascend to power, because only with them is power inert.  If someone competent gains power, then the Dear Leader is soon gone.  A true Democracy can enjoy leaders who are competent because, like the One Ring cast into Mount Doom, power is (somewhat) dispersed. The People can call for change & bloodlessly replace leaders.  In a Democracy, failure is not rewarded with a firing squad, but a comfortable sinecure and an opportunity to write memoirs.  Apparently, as an Independent calling for Democracy in the USA, this makes me a ""Communist"".  What a crock of **SHIT**.  All I want for the USA is for our nation to have the same rights as Denmark, France, India, Australia, or New Zealand.  If we'd had Democracy in the USA back in 2016, Cheeto Hitler would be doing what he does best.  Talking shit on Primetime TV.  Instead we've got a Dollar that's turning into toilet paper with the Trump Slump and a country that is looking at Balkanization & becoming a Failed State.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-22T06:12:15,23

"> John Ullyot, who served as a Pentagon spokesperson until he was asked to resign, wrote in Politico that “it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer.” He added that “the president deserves better” and “many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly” if Hegseth is fired.  Stunning that Ullyot refuses to acknowledge the problems start at the top. HR McMaster’s book, “at war with ourselves”, is a genuine attempt to look back at his time in the WH with a historical view. All of the critiques he laid out made it easy to anticipate the even worse dysfunction that would come with a Trump return. It’s not like he did a hatchet job either: McMaster was quite frustrated the admin couldn’t get the nods it rated when it earned them, however often it may have been that the stories were undermined by the trump admin itself. Sadly for us all, MAGA and the Andrew Tate set ain’t big on book learning. The title is a damn near perfect reflection of trump’s habits of making the easiest lay up into a marathon like ordeal as he does his “weave”.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T07:36:55,5

"FTA:  ""Trump’s national security team was recently rattled by an Oval Office visit from Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist""   ""theorist""? Really, AP? That gives the impression that she's studied and has a degree in the study of far-right conspiracies.   There are no ""far-right conspiracies"" to theorise, there are only nut-job whackadoodles who have unfettered access to the White House and its current nut-job occupants.  US press is far too cautious with their language, imo, and it's a disservice to the nation.",LowerBed5334,2025-04-22T06:05:39,8
