I would not trust them to bring water to a thirsty child, let alone work to resolve anything.  Should we give them a chance to ""fix thisngs""?  No.  They have shown their allegiance is with Trump.

"It‚Äôs sort of funny, because that‚Äôs true of the mainstream congressional type Dems, and also true for a lot of the more activist types.

It‚Äôs way easier to change a policy if you got elected to *be the guy in the job* than it is by protesting and petitioning some other guy in that job who disagrees with you. And it‚Äôs way easier to take over an existing party infrastructure bit by bit than to build a new one.   None of this is a secret!
