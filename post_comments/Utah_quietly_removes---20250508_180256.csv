"> Utah’s transgender teens have previously indicated to state officials they are 3 ½ times more likely than their peers to consider taking their own lives, almost 4 ½ times more likely to experience severe depression and are two to three times more likely to experiment with drugs and alcohol.  > But those figures documenting transgender students’ emotional struggles in conservative Utah are no longer available to the public, having been quietly purged from a state website.  > Links to data on how transgender students’ mental health is faring on the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Substance Abuse and Mental Health site have been deleted, while other demographic-specific reports remain accessible.  > Changes to the website come as orders from the White House increasingly act to erase the visibility of transgender Americans, including ordering public health data that President Donald Trump’s administration has labeled “gender ideology” taken down.  > According to web page snapshots preserved by the Internet Archive, “Transgender Student Profile Report[s]” compiled from the statewide Student Health and Risk Prevention survey, commonly known as SHARP, were available on the Utah Office of Substance Use and Mental Health site on Feb. 2. By March 4 those reports had disappeared.  > “The knowledge we’ve gained from the SHARP survey is invaluable,” the website where reports are posted says, “because it tells us where to look for problems and solutions.”  > It continues, “Local health departments, local prevention coalitions, local schools and school districts, superintendents, health systems, public health professionals, and most importantly, parents use SHARP data to develop programs and services to help Utah youth and families.”  > Now, a note at the top of the CDC page says, “Any information on this page promoting gender ideology is extremely inaccurate and disconnected from the immutable biological reality that there are two sexes, male and female. The Trump Administration rejects gender ideology and condemns the harms it causes to children, by promoting their chemical and surgical mutilation, and to women, by depriving them of their dignity, safety, well-being, and opportunities. This page does not reflect biological reality and therefore the Administration and this Department rejects it.”  > The axing of Utah transgender youth’s mental health data comes as resources for the group, which has historically seen heightened risk of mental health challenges and suicide, are in jeopardy. The Trump administration is proposing cutting specialized help for young LGBTQ+ people from the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.  > “[Government officials] try to defend this by saying they don’t want to advance certain ideologies, but the fact is that this is really not about ideology. It’s just about understanding population health,” said Ilan Meyer, a distinguished senior scholar at the Williams Institute at UCLA, which researches public policy around sexual orientation and gender identity.  > Transgender students’ responses were scrubbed from the DHHS website less than a year after a law requiring parental permission for students to take the SHARP survey took effect, likely already inhibiting the amount of youth mental health data Utah is able to collect. Experts say limiting which demographic information is available is an additional blow to the usefulness of behavioral surveys like SHARP.",WhatYouThinkYouSee,2025-05-08T18:07:18,6
