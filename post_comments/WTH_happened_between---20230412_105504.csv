"Seems likely Putin informed his poodle that both the details of donny's huge debt to the Russian Mob/Oligarchs/Government (often the same person) AND the pee tapes would remain well hidden so long as he did as he was told, and donny was in total agreement. If it wasn't for the invasion of Ukraine, after the trial, Biden could probably work a prisoner exchange - we get back our reporter, they get back their poodle.",Olderscout77,2023-04-17T09:21:06,3
"We will likely never know. The only way we will know is if Trump, Putin, or the translators reveal what was said. Of course most people would hesitate to take what Trump says at face value, most people would also hesitate to take what Putin says at face value, and translators are literally paid to NOT reveal what was said.  At this point it's old news so no one is wasting any time or effort trying to figure out what was said in the meeting 6 years ago.",ProLifePanda,2023-04-17T08:33:05,2
"Never is a long time and we got all sorts of interesting info after the last Russian Revolution - confirmation that the Rosenbergs were Commie spies  springs to mind. If Putin's disaster in Ukraine continues and he falls out a window, the ""new guy"" might be happy to sell tRump to end the sanctions, esp as it gets less and less likely he'll ever be POTUS again.",Olderscout77,2023-04-17T09:25:26,2
"Well to be fair, I did say LIKELY never know. I'd be willing to bet money on never getting any solid info on the meeting beyond what we already ""know"".  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russia%E2%80%93United_States_summit  That has a pretty good summary of the summit and what we know was discussed there. But I'd question anything Trump and/or Putin says was discussed outside of what we already know. And we can be pretty confident whoever the US translator was/is professional enough to not divulge anything. And Putin's translator is likely in his pocket so it's unlikely to come out from there.  Can some details come out? Sure. Do I think it's likely? No. But even if information DOES come out, it's extremely unlikely to be something juicy. It isn't like Putin and Trump were discussing how to bring the US down. They likely hit on some high level topics, fawned over one another, and Putin let Trump ramble for 90 of the 120 minutes.",ProLifePanda,2023-04-17T09:43:36,1
">Your statement requires a slight modification:   >   >*It isn't like Putin and Trump were discussing how to bring the US down.* ***AND tRump KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.*** Putin on the other hand knew EXACTLY what was happening. It was a meeting between the former head of the KGB and Bozo the approval seeking clown.   >   >The clue-deprived orange moron was played like a fiddle, later gave the Russian ambassador details on Israeli defense plans and kept the FBI from seriously investigating all the help he got in the 2016 election *because Putin told him to*. IF DOJ grows a spine in the next couple weeks, we may learn what TS SCI documents tRump stole from the Whitehouse that would be of interest to his buddy Vlad, but one rule when you find such a document is missing, is not let the other guys know you know.",Olderscout77,2023-04-17T15:18:46,1
