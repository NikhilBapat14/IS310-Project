"Afrikaners aren't refugees, they are colonizers from a failed apartheid state. The fact that my homeland is carrying water for them and granting them privileges denied to more deserving people is disheartening.",Raul1024,2025-05-09T02:17:49,39

"We lived next door for about five years to a South African (white) man who had emigrated to the US. Im convinced that’s why he married his wife, who he didn’t even seem to like that much.   He’d make comments there about how the culture there wasn’t nearly what you’d expect and oh so hostile. I can only imagine what he’d heard from his parents who had emigrated there.",Organic-Class-8537,2025-05-09T07:51:58,1
"These folks won’t be liked here.   Under any circumstances, sure, welcome. But after the racial profiling since the 1st and now 2n Admin, I don’t foresee them having an easy time adjusting to life in America.   Edit:   Since I got downvoted, here’s an anecdotal as source:  My niece, upstate NY born, daughter of American-Polish (6+ generations in the US) and a American-Irish-Italian (6+ generations in the US), is a porcelain white-strawberry blonde hair-blue eyes kid.   She experienced so much racism when she started to go to the university of Alabama … for being an outsider, a Yankee, “talking funny”, and for having a “weird” (her dad’s Polish) last name … that she legally changed her name six months into school to her mother’s Irish-but more English-sounding maiden name.  Let that sink in.   My niece can’t get any more white and more American. And still. ",oatchick,2025-05-09T03:34:44,1

"They are in for a very rude awakening in the US. Once the Trump media circus is over, they will long for South Africa as White America is not as welcoming as the WH likes to portray.

many of the boers have roots in africa of more than 200 years. the majority bantus came sometime later.  they're literally as african as they come. doubt that they even have any dutchness left in them.,Menter33,2025-05-09T10:04:45,1

they technically grew up there though. their as native as the bantus who migrated from the middle of africa to the south after the dutch arrived.,Menter33,2025-05-09T10:03:35,1
"> boers have roots in africa of more than 200 years  Yes, 200 years ago, colonization, particularly in Africa, was well underway for the enrichment of Europeans at the expense of indigenous people.   >literally as african as they come. doubt that they even have any dutchness left in them  They are called Africanners because they speak Afrikaans, a dialect of Dutch, and boer means farmer in Dutch. You are trying to espouse a civic nationalism in South Africa that doesn't exist in the people who actively supported apartheid. They never considered themselves on the same level as their Bantu neighbors, they lived segregated lives.",Raul1024,2025-05-09T15:02:29,4
"I'm not sure if that's true. White Canadian here on a TN visa in Texas, and I can say my personal experience has not made it feel particularly welcoming at all. But I lean left and fact-check people overtly spreading misinformation, so that's probably why.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-09T07:28:54,3
"there have been many historical examples where people groups have lived in a place while maintaining separate languages. in fact, for many, it's something to be proud of. (edit: otoh, it's still good to know the dominant language just to make sure multicultural exchange and understanding can occur.)  &nbsp;  and as far as history is concerned, after the dutch left in the early 1800s, leaving the boers to fend for themselves. the boers basically aren't really considered dutch anymore.  kinda like how the people from madagascar now are really different from their southeast asian ancestors. both the boer and the malagasy are considered their own people groups.",Menter33,2025-05-09T22:55:40,1
"Well, your accent isn't very interesting. Haha   I say that mostly in jest, but there is some truth to it. I think most people in the US consider Canadians to be basically kinder, more boring Americans. There's really not a lot of distinction between someone from Canada and aomeone from Michigan.   Buuuut when we get people from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, or a good chunk of Europe, they have an accent that's just absolutely fascinating to us. (I'd bet it's the same in Canada, yeah?) Uniforms and accents, those make a lot of people swoon. Somehow being in uniform or having a ""cool""  accent makes people more interesting and thus more attractive. It's stupid and I hate it, but it's true.   Also, I don't know if the, uh, tensions between our current administration and you all have made some people here feel more prickly about Canadians. It would be stupid as hell, but we're not known for being the sharpest tools in the shed, so it wouldn't surprise me.   I'm sorry you have to be in Texas. That's... not the preferred place for a left-leaning, intelligent individual. And I'm sorry you don't feel very welcome. I hope that changes.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-09T08:31:05,2
"Sorry to say, but I think you’re sharing your own biases and not the reality of the state of Kentucky and the south:  European accent here …  My ex-husband got made fun of when he was traveling through south for taking funny — he is from Upstate NY so he talks faster, but their “accent” is often mimicked by newscasters.   I’ve gotten all kinds of guesses for my accent — because people are awkwardly curious *and* not geographically astute *and* not audibly diverse. I’ve come to learn, that even when I tell them where my accent is from, they are mostly asking because it’s hard for them to understand me. Same goes for Irish, Scottish, Australian, and yea, South African.   Saying this because *you* might think it’s cool, but there’s a huge chuck on the population that feels very uncomfortable with funny speaking people.   (See my comment above on white on white racism in Alabama.)",oatchick,2025-05-09T11:34:56,1
"Studies do tend to agree that the ones I mentioned are very popular and desirable in a partner.   [Link ](https://www.highlandtitles.com/blog/global-accent-battle/)  [Link 2](https://preply.com/en/blog/americas-favorite-accents-2023/)  And Americans are seemingly obsessed with British television shows and period pieces. There are so many already and they keep cranking them out. (Don't get me started on how every single one of them has British accents even when they're supposed to be about other countries, but I digress.)  I've not heard a great number of South African folks speak, but the few I did I never had a problem understanding. Granted, I spent the first 29 years of my life in Southern California, so I've been exposed to a lot.   I think, too, one's experience partly depends on where they are. A foreigner in a large American city is much more likely to be accepted and embraced than the same foreigner would be in Bumpkinville USA. Small town country folk are often not exposed to many people outside their bubble, so they tend to be more reluctant to embrace people that aren't locals.   I do admit, though, that most Americans are not particularly warm and welcoming people. I'm assuming the Afrikaners will be settled in larger cities, so at least the odds will be higher that they'll blend in. Even Louisville has a fantastic blend of people from all over the world, and we're not that big as big cities go.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-09T12:17:25,1
