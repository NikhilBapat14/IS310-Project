"The only time there's ever been a direct war between two nuclear-armed countries has been between India and Pakistan in 1999. It lasted two months and no nukes got deployed, so hopefully they'll be able to keep the violence reasonable and contained.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-06T16:21:14,179
"Indeed, these two countries do not like each other for a very long time.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T16:43:01,46
"A long-festering dispute over contested territory between 2 nuclear armed nations with a third watching from close by is never a recipe for good times. My thoughts to the people on both sides and hopefully the conflict settles down again or at least stays at a low grade and, obviously, nonnuclear",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-06T16:13:40,95
The left is unsurprisingly somehow trying to spin this as Trump's fault lol.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-06T18:38:25,50

"Where are all the ""hostile invaders must be resisted at all costs, even if they're armed with nuclear weapons !"" Folks jumping to Pakistan's defense?  Something tells me that all the people demanding escalation to bring Russia to its knees over its invasion of Ukraine and declaring that Ukraine should not give up one inch of territory to end the fighting, will be advocating for a negotiated settlement between Pakistan and India instead of jumping to Pakistan's defense because hostile invaders who try to bully their neighbors should only be resisted when it's convenient, or profitable.",Shadeylark,2025-05-07T06:48:49,-3
"Yup. If anybody can do it, they can. They've done this before.  Plus, Trump and strong US leadership will be there to make sure things don't get too out of hand.",MMcDeer,2025-05-06T19:56:35,-20
It's pathetic. TDS is a real and serious disease.,MMcDeer,2025-05-06T19:56:55,18
"If things go sideways and one or both use nukes, I’m not blaming Trump.  On the other side of that coin, I don’t think you can credit Trump with keeping peace between these two nations.  At the end of the day, they’re gonna do what they feel they need to do.  India has a “no first strike” policy.  Pakistan doesn’t.  If Pakistan strikes with one of their tactical nukes, India will likely turn parts of Pakistan into glass.    Again, this has little to nothing to do with anything Trump does or says.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-07T09:02:15,5
"It's so funny, I saw one person comment they're going to war because Trump is weak, like yea sure two countries that have hated each other since the 1940s and want to see each other's annihilation definitely took Trump halfway across the world into consideration when they started lobbing rockets lol.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-06T20:10:24,11
Have to ask why Russia invaded Georgia and Ukraine twice under the watch of the last 2 democratic presidents then,BaronVonCoors,2025-05-06T23:46:25,14
