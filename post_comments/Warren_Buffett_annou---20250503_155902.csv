Well Trump can't arrest a billionaire so Warren is free to criticise him as much as he wants.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-05-03T16:07:29,1
"Kinda sweet that the old billionaires have something to say before they shuffle off into the great unknown.  Not putting Buffett in the same category as McConnell.  But their legacy is harm until they get, really, really old.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-03T16:15:53,1
"Buffett is the canary in the coal mine, and the canary just committed suicide.",bassplayerguy,2025-05-03T17:48:22,1

The further we move away from capitalism the worse off we are  We need to return to free trade and ASAP.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T17:31:00,1
Trump really should’ve just focused his tariffs on china instead of everyone,Then-Sand9641,2025-05-03T16:04:32,1
I don’t understand the point of having a billion dollars and still working. Like you have enough money to do whatever you want go enjoy the human experience in god mode.,citizenkane86,2025-05-03T16:45:49,1

What? What do you think our economic model is?,Grandpa_No,2025-05-03T17:36:10,1
"Focusing it on China would've had 90% of the economic effect it currently has, with the slight difference that Canada would've likely elected Cons.",alabasterskim,2025-05-03T16:06:41,1
"Berkshire is holding on to some $340 Billion dollars in cash, ready to sweep in and clean house after Trump crashes the economy.  He's warning us about what is coming if the orange man isn't stopped, but they aren't about to miss out on the free lunch if Americans continue down the same path of stupidity.",littleemp,2025-05-03T16:49:38,1
That’s just it.  They love to work.,Pretend-Excuse-8368,2025-05-03T17:20:18,1
It's no longer capitalism. Tariffs are completely against capitalism. Capitalism is built on free trade and not regulations.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T17:42:32,1
"China is a bloody genocidal dictatorship, doing business with USA is just a step toward a larger plan for China, not the goal.   Unfortunately the west is too addicted to short term profit to care. China is playing the long con while the west is only interest in the next quarterly result.",crxsso_dssreer,2025-05-03T19:54:30,1
I meant small percentages instead of those large ones he did,Then-Sand9641,2025-05-03T16:07:18,1
"Yeah, no. Free markets are markets where the value of goods and services is based on the willingness of buyers and sellers to trade at that price in contrast to governments setting prices directly. Capitalism is the economic system based on ownership and exchange of _capital_ vs, say, goods. Or, simply, where private individuals own the means of production.  Laissez-faire is what you're thinking of and no one does that because it doesn't work.  Don't worry if this is news to you. Usually the libertarianism wears off in a year or two.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-03T18:37:30,1
>  Tariffs are completely against capitalism.  No. You're mixing up capitalism and the free market. Go read the wealth of nations again.,crxsso_dssreer,2025-05-03T19:52:43,1
