"Fuck Trump.  Fuck this parade if he makes it about himself, such as posting giant screens with him center stage like Putin does (which I don't doubt he will make it about himself), and you know what fuck maga too.  Ok I'm done. ",arilupe,2025-05-09T19:10:01,66

"So I’m not really all that worried about a celebration of the nation for 250 years.  I mean it’s a milestone.  But look at the projected cost of celebrating the 250th year of being a country versus Trump’s birthday wank off.  That’s the joke here.  Dude will spend more on his military parade than he will on the nation’s birthday.  But, that’s “America First”, isn’t.",NarfledGarthak,2025-05-10T04:48:42,2

"I've said it before and will say it again. Since I did not see the confirmed date although eluded to. If it falls on trumps birthday, I will not be giving it any attention at all. it will be another day for me. I will not, even if it is a single view (and in the greater scheme of things inconsequential), I will not in any capacity promote or view the event.   I will enjoy my 4th of July and enjoy at that point, but I cannot in any capacity celebrate 250 years on the date of birth of a traitor, a felon, and someone who has contributed to the falling of this country.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-10T01:30:53,1
