Dude bankrupted multiple casinos. He’s not going to explain anything related to global economics.,DisastrousCicada3802,2025-05-01T03:57:50,3
One blackly funny thing is the fact that Reddit assumed this crashing the economy thing was done by the oligarchs to buy up everything but it's fairly clear they have no idea if the market IS going to go back up and are as confused by this as anyone.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-01T04:35:18,3

"Not quite yet.  We were at our weakest during the Civil War.
