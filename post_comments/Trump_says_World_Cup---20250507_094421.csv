Just more evidence that Donald Trump really does not have a clue about anything.,jediporcupine,2025-05-07T09:46:25,48
"Further proof that Trump can't think.    He thinks Russia would want to play in the World Cup so much that it would end the war to do so.  Seriously, he is mentally ill and says whatever madness comes to him.",Smithy2232,2025-05-07T09:47:28,26
He simply doesn't know anything. He's gotta be the dumbest president we've ever had.,FunkyChedda,2025-05-07T09:52:40,14
"If you filled a book with all the stuff Trump was unaware of, you’d have a library",shadowdra126,2025-05-07T10:40:51,3
It’ll be pretty funny if MAGA all become huge soccer fans because Trump’s talking about the World Cup.,meTspysball,2025-05-07T10:52:48,2
"Is the World Cup even happening at this point? I’m sure a lot of people, especially brown people with non-Anglo names, are wondering if it’s worth risking a gulag for a football game in a hostile, fascist nation.",sylbug,2025-05-07T10:53:48,2
"""Trump...unaware...""",DiceMadeOfCheese,2025-05-07T12:24:04,2
"Its like we took our racist uncle who spit balls the stupidest, half-baked ideas at the family barbecue, and made him an actual president.",cstar4004,2025-05-07T13:00:30,1
He's as big a gaffe machine as Biden AND can't speak beyond the level of a child. Ffs.,Middle-Potential5765,2025-05-07T14:16:29,1
Putin doesn’t care about sports he is way too deep on it. And if they are let back people will boycott,oct2790,2025-05-08T05:05:14,1
Every day we discover how unaware he has lived. President Bubble Boy.,yorapissa,2025-05-08T06:09:33,1
"Also, even if Russia is allowed back, they wouldn't be able to play in 2026 since UEFA round 1 has already started.",gauderio,2025-05-07T14:45:47,6
Who ends a war anyway for sports? Bonkers,phideaux_rocks,2025-05-07T16:31:12,2
"It's proof he's a sociopath.  He thinks participating in a sports tournament is an incentive to end territorial conquest and deadly violence.  I have said before, he is one of the 1000 least qualified humans to lead, because the combination of his mental derangement, his lack of desire to improve himself, and lack of perspective on the normal human experience, at any point in his 80 years on this earth, makes him fundamentally alien, unrelateable, and lacking in skills",GaimeGuy,2025-05-07T11:27:23,7
They won’t even end the war for cross country skiing so they could beat Norway,Lillemor_hei,2025-05-07T10:02:01,2
I wonder if there is any topic he is actually knowledgeable about and could speak on without sounding like a mush brained idiot,SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-07T11:19:58,5
I’m waiting for them to announce they’re moving the US games to Canada and Mexico. Vance said it would be a great opportunity to round up people.,NemesisShadow,2025-05-07T12:11:30,3
Trump is a very simple minded guy. He doesn’t think in real world terms.,jediporcupine,2025-05-07T16:33:34,2
He wants daddy to come to the states and he can show off what he’s done.. in Russias honor lol,Acrobatic-Bluejay-79,2025-05-07T15:58:37,2
