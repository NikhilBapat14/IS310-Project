"Anyone celebrating this because he's ""a Republican"", apart from the terrible lack of empathy, has no idea what the fuck they're talking about. Souter was a good Justice and retired to give Obama his first SCOTUS judge.¬†",ChocoboAndroid,2025-05-09T08:34:52,46

"He's a weird favorite to have, and he himself would likely assert that the term ""favorite"" should be inapplicable to jurists, but David Souter may just be my favorite supreme court justice.  A borderline hermit, he was a deeply humble man who was a true believer in the model the constitution should provide to a just society, and was devoted to upholding, sustaining, and developing it for modernity.   While he probably wouldn't have called it ""bravery"", it was a brave thing to shut out public opinion from within his party and side with the liberal wing of SCOTUS (his supposed opposition) time and time again, because doing so comported with his judicial ethics, and how he interpreted the constitution as a living document.   His opinions and dissents were a bright spot for me in law school, and his adherence to his principles should be a guiding light for all future jurists and members of any bar. I'll miss him.",GeorgeEBHastings,2025-05-09T10:24:29,5
"Can‚Äôt tell if the hate here is from uninformed liberals who only see he was appointed by a Republican or from republicans still pissed that he turned out to be a flaming liberal on the bench.   Without Souter, roe would have been basically overturned in 92.",travio,2025-05-09T08:37:53,18
"My favorite Souter anecdote:  Sandra Day O'Connor‚Äîwho back in Phoenix was once known as ""the yenta of Paradise Valley""‚Äîtried and failed to fix him up. Then, according to Jeffrey Toobin's new book, ""The Nine,"" an unnamed justice sent him on a date with a woman who reported a delightful jaunt‚Äîuntil the end: ""Souter took her home, told her what a good time he had, then added, 'Let's do this again next year'.""  My second favorite anecdote:  Justice Roberts told a story about a well-known mix-up. ‚ÄúSomeone comes up to Justice Souter and mistakes him for Justice Breyer and asks, ‚ÄòJustice Breyer, What‚Äôs the best thing about being on the Supreme Court?‚Äô‚Äù said Roberts. ‚ÄúAnd David says, ‚ÄòServing with Justice Souter.‚Äô‚Äù",Miserable-Wind1334,2025-05-09T09:42:44,6

Thank you. Souter was everything you would ever want in a Supreme Court Justice. He followed no political doctrine or orders. He interpreted the law based on ethics and not partisanship regardless if it was conservative or liberal issue. He was a firm believer that the court should be above politics and the judiciary is a critical check to our democracy. He nearly resigned from the court after Bush v Gore because he was so disgusted with how political the court was becoming. WYNC studios More Perfect Podcast did a fantastic episode called ‚ÄúNo More Souters‚Äù. All this is to say if the Supreme Court had more justices like Souter we would be in a much better place today.,The_RonJames,2025-05-09T12:18:59,5

"100% agree. When I was poly sci student Souter fascinated me more than any other justice and quickly became my favorite. His commitment to the ideals of democracy and equality were quite remarkable. He didn‚Äôt care about party loyalty or partisanship he only cared about the law and whether it fair, just and relevant to today‚Äôs society. His clear and concise style when writing opinions was also remarkable. In my personal opinion Souter was exactly what you want in a Supreme Court justice.",The_RonJames,2025-05-09T12:27:21,2

"He flipped sides way before that. Republicans very quickly realized during his first year that he wouldn't play the stooge they wanted him to be, and vowed ""No More Souters"" for future nominees.
