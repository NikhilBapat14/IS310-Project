"At what point do you just say oops and move on?  Trump could fix it in two minutes.  Congress could fix it today.  Well, not fix.  We are screwed, but it’s just going to keep getting worse.",dbuck1964,2025-05-06T08:52:30,59
"The US doesn't have enough freighters. Export can only happen when freighters from places like China come to offload their goods, then we send them our exports   1-D Tic-tac-toe Trump can't comprehend that if you scare the freighters from docking, our goods can't go out either.",theassassintherapist,2025-05-06T08:57:43,37
Congrats to all those farmers and ranchers who voted Trump.,zubbs99,2025-05-06T09:29:18,19
Nobody wants to buy stuff from the US anymore because of the tariffs.  Are you guys great now?,thieh,2025-05-06T08:50:57,36

"Make sure to thank the Republicans and the Trump Regime because medical supply shortages have already started, and tariffs on medication will be here soon.

Between product boycotts by America’s trading partners to the inability of manufacturers and farmers to purchase inputs required to make goods for export the damage from the trade war is going to be felt mostly by the people Trump believes he is helping.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-06T08:53:30,4

Seems like they’re having the opposite effect from what they intended,mymar101,2025-05-06T10:44:06,2
Oh Congress did one better. The GOP basically voted to keep this going in Congress instead of using their power to kill this bullshit.,Used-Yogurtcloset757,2025-05-06T09:09:18,43
> Trump could fix it in two minutes  Could he though?  It would just be another bit of instability to add to the mix given all the other delays and reversals and contradictions.,wonkifier,2025-05-06T10:17:51,9
They are doing this on purpose so he can declare martial law once people start taking to the streets and getting violent,finitefuck,2025-05-06T09:06:25,10
Their fix will be to use tax money to bailout their supporters who are suffering from their tariffs.,g2g079,2025-05-06T09:51:54,4
Trump has said on numerous occasions that he's never apologized because he's never been wrong. Pot-committed doesn't even begin to describe that lunatic.,threehundredthousand,2025-05-06T14:08:44,2
"It has been drilled into his head for his entire life that admitting mistakes is weakeness, this will last until we get another president. But he will double down and lie that it isn’t bad until then.",Visible-Extension685,2025-05-06T11:23:00,1

Tariffs and expansionist rhetoric. Our once allies will no longer buy American because he opened his big fat mouth.,Used-Yogurtcloset757,2025-05-06T09:08:19,18
"Not yet, we need more racism, old shitty cars, less health regulations, more dumb fucks pretending to be smart. We’re not there yet my friend, I have a feeling it’s going to get real ugly here in the us before long, I’m ready for it, let’s do it now so my daughter can live in a more peaceful country",PristineJeweler4179,2025-05-06T09:26:01,9

"It's not just the tariffs, it's the volatility and uncertainty.   When someone orders a product they usually want to get the product and have leverage or options if they don't. These things went the way of the dodo when trump started dumping trade agreements.",s-mores,2025-05-06T12:27:05,3
"I think this could have gone a lot differently if we just worried about pissing off China a little bit at a time. No, let's piss off the entire globe at once so we kill whatever leverage we have.",g2g079,2025-05-06T09:49:53,2

"To be clear, the House didn't vote on this. A committee voted in a House rule that would evade the mandatory vote required by law on the emergency that gives the president this power. They are sabotaging the democratic process dictated by law.  If they were confident that the House would vote to uphold the emergency declaration, they wouldn't have felt the need to do this undemocratic (and potentially unlawful) tomfoolery.",ManyInterests,2025-05-06T12:48:10,8
"Yeah, he could reverse course, but he’s set up YEARS of economic damage. Things can’t be fixed in minutes, it will take a LONG time to approach anything resembling the economy of 2024",ArenSteele,2025-05-06T11:12:41,7

"Maybe he needs to publicly blame Trump, he's always dancing around and avoiding saying the truth that trump is incompetent",Illustrious_Entry413,2025-05-06T12:15:54,7
People want to do business with us. There is a lot of money to be made from the USA. Reddit vastly over estimates how many people in power in the world care about principles over profits.,fiberglass_pirate,2025-05-06T14:18:13,2
"This isn’t about wanting to do business, it’s about chaos, trust, and the failure of American logistics.  We’d love to sell you what Americans want to buy, but it’s not going to get to the factories or store shelves with any reliability, so we’ll sell it to Europe and Asia. The US can buy what’s left over, or they can pay a higher price for the increased risk and liability",ArenSteele,2025-05-06T16:04:27,2
