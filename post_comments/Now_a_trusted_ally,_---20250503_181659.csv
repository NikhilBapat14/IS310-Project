"Rubio is showing the wear and tear you get from working for a mentally deranged man. His skin is pasty white, there are blue bags under his eyes and his hair has lost its sheen. If I didn't think he was such an extreme-right Christian Nationalist tool, I'd almost feel sorry for him.",invalidpassword,2025-05-03T18:31:45,13

"We all saw his multitasking ability, giving a national speech, and drinking water while never breaking eye contact. The Trump administration decided that was credentials enough to give him 4 jobs simultaneously.",localistand,2025-05-03T19:38:07,2

"If Rubio wants to run for president in the future, any chance he had was thrown out the window by accepting the position as Secretary of State. Hell, even Cubans in Florida are upset with him about it.",D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-04T00:06:12,1
I like when we use Trump‚Äôs nicknames for his now loyal stooges.,Trick-Lobster-6297,2025-05-04T02:33:01,1

That doesn't matter. Because the Democrats are in the minority they have the luxury of knowing that their votes will have no effect. Therefore they are free to vote their conscience. Their vote on Rubio tells us a lot about their conscience.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-04T07:43:11,1
