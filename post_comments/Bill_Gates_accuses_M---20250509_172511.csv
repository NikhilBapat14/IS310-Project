"Bill Gates also said no to sharing the IP of Covid vaccines with developing nations during the height of the pandemic. Remember they said everyone needed vaccines and they saved lives, but they only worked when you bought them from the companies Gates was already invested in.  Then, after Gates sold his shares, all of a sudden the vaccine wasnt as effective and also the Covid variants were weaker.

More totalitarian nations run their shit on windows than any other operating system. Bill Gates is one step away from genocide in China and Tibet. I donâ€™t really wanna hear moralism from him.,notsocharmingprince,2025-05-09T18:15:57,4
"We can say that Bill Gates is guilty of creating a widespread operating system, so the public can have computers, get on the internet, and look up porn and violence. Some depraved minds got hooked on porn and raped women. Others watched violence and murdered people.
