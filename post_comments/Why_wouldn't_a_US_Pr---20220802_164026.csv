The only problem would be that the next President could reverse them all. Better to get laws passed.,theistgal,2022-08-03T15:14:07,2
Most aspects of a presidential agenda require funding and/or changes to existing law. That canâ€™t happen by EO.,cincyblog,2022-08-03T16:34:04,2
"So Executive orders can't create laws, they are just official proclamations on how the Executive Branch interprets/implements laws passed by Congress.  For example, if you read Joe Biden's executive order on protecting access to reproductive rights, it doesn't DO much. It's largely symbolic, like many Executive Orders are.  https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/07/13/2022-15138/protecting-access-to-reproductive-healthcare-services  Section 1 & 2 are background and definitions.  Section 3 directs the Secretary of Health and Human services to create a report on how to protect and expand abortion care and other reproductive health procedures, how to subsidize reproductive health services, promote awareness of contraceptive services, and encourage legal organizations to help women travel to seek these services. This is largely symbolic and has no ""real"" results.  Section 4 just says the Secretary of Homeland Security and AG should protect reproductive service providers, which was always the law. It also directs the agencies to ensure people seeking reproductive health services are free from fraud, including the FTC to protect user privacy where legally applicable, the HHS to protect patient privacy in accordance with the law, educating people on their rights to medical privacy, and address any deceptive or fraudulent practices related to reproductive health services. This is just ""formally"" stating power these departments already had.  Section 5 just says ""All these departments can work together on a Task Force to do the above.""  Section 6 is legalese saying ""Everything above is legal and within the right of the Executive Branch.  So the EO didn't really DO anything, just maybe refocused priorities from these departments to include reproductive health services.  This isn't saying it's BAD. But just that EOs are largely symbolic, with a few important ones thrown in. A lot of the important ones get challenged and shot down or drawn out in court.",ProLifePanda,2022-08-04T09:00:57,1
"Great insight thank you. Wish there was a way to streamline initiatives that meet public majority wishes. For example, Americans overwhelmingly favor abortion rights in some circumstances yet states were quick to enact strict anti-abortion laws. Enacting laws many times get caught up in limbo and passing Amendments are almost impossible. It would be great if there was an easier route for large initiatives, like abortion rights in certain circumstances, to reflect the people's will as long as it had a super-majority of citizen approval (say 60%+). Right now we are at the mercy of three branches of government who really control our civil rights.",desertdweller365,2022-08-04T11:29:25,1
"What you're looking for is constitutional reform. We very much COULD do these things by getting rid of the filibuster, dropping bicameralism, reducing federalism, getting rid of separation of powers, etc. Most other modern democracies do these things because the idea is that government outcomes should be closely tied to and constrained by public opinion. The US is one of the few democracies that doesn't operate that way.",mormagils,2022-08-05T08:57:26,2
