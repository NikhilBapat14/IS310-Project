"This is going to largely depend on the specific bill you are referring to.  But big picture, Manchin is a ""blue dog Democrat"". These are Democrats who actively seek the Center-Right of the Democratic Party, often defying the party line as going too far. This name/group was founded in the 1990's as a response to Democrats losing seats in 1994. Manchin is not an ""official"" member but has been given the title based on his politics. Manchin represents West Virginia, where Trump won by ~40% over Biden. The only reason Manchin wins is his incumbency, and the fact he routinely disagrees with the Democratic Party on many leftist issues. This is just to frame where Manchin's mindset is. Manchin must routinely align himself with the Republicans and conservatives to ensure he can win re-election. Make no mistake, the minute Manchin leaves office, a Republican is winning that seat.  On to specifics, Manchin opposed electric vehicles recently because these vehicles and their parts are manufactured overseas, particularly China. Manchin is very hesitant over spending (remember Manchin and Sinema alone torpedoed the ""Build Back Better"" plan in 2021 solely based on costs), so he opposes unnecessary tax credits and opposes the fact these tax credits support manufacturing in other countries over America.  https://rollcall.com/2023/03/31/new-electric-vehicle-credit-rules-set-over-manchins-objections/  >""American tax dollars should not be used to support manufacturing jobs overseas,"" Manchin said. ""It is a pathetic excuse to spend more tax payer dollars as quickly as possible and further cedes control to the Chinese Communist Party in the process.""  Manchin only agreed to the tax credit because it would stimulate domestic manufacturing, and is now critical the Administration is loosening the rules and letting manufacturing going overseas.  West Virginia also has very few EVs, so his constituents aren't clamoring for more EVs.",ProLifePanda,2023-05-18T12:28:19,3
"c-span channels keep data base committee coverage of Committee information for House and Senate member.  Replay the committee to understand the answer you are seeking.  Wikipedia can give a background profile, check to see the dates last entry was made.  Contact The White House or The Hill, and search out the Senate or House members and ask them directly by e-mail.",[deleted],2023-05-16T08:33:07,1
"> This is going to largely depend on the specific bill you are referring to.  Well I posted over two weeks ago so my memory fails on what exactly the trigger was.  But thanks for the info. I feel like his rhetoric has been strongly opposed to electrification in general, but you're right he specifically mentioned overseas manufacturing in reference to the tax credits.",LtPowers,2023-05-18T13:01:47,1
"I was hoping for something other than primary sources, as those are obviously going to be self-interested answers (or else too politic to be useful). I was hoping for some sort of expert analysis.",LtPowers,2023-05-16T12:26:48,1
">Well I posted over two weeks ago so my memory fails on what exactly the trigger was.  Then yeah, it was related to this. Manchin only agreed to the tax credits as long as the cars are using parts manufactured domestically, boosting US manufacturing. The Biden Administration is now seeking to ""re-interpret"" the law to loosen up the requirements, which has Manchin upset.  But Manchin has routinely been opposed to tax credits and funding for EVs because he generally opposes spending, claims they don't need funding, and other standard complaints.",ProLifePanda,2023-05-18T13:09:28,2
C-SPAN Channels cover actual U.S. Congress many Committee Meetings and opportunities to watch the voting process on Bills before The House or Senate.  Make up your own mind by listening to the actual elected officials.  These have created an opportunity to write my elected members.  I am direct and not always pleasant with them in my writing.,[deleted],2023-05-23T04:58:10,2
>   Make up your own mind by listening to the actual elected officials.   I know what they *say*. I'm trying to get at what they *mean*.,LtPowers,2023-05-23T07:59:06,1
"I evaluate what they say/argue in their varied assigned Committee Meeting; but tone as as well as tone and what their body parts in view expresses.  Is it actual support or for the C-SPAN viewers.  Otherwise write them individually and see if their communication style to your question is giddily glue.  My 2 Senators and 1 Congressperson are not real in their staff answer.  Then I write Chair and Co-chair.  Democracy can't work; unless we work to keep it.  Presently, that is in question for me.  Partisan voting patterns currently leave my guts in knots.  That is my clearest point, many more people need to keep eyes and ears on what they say in Committee followed by their Floor Vote.",[deleted],2023-05-24T22:22:56,1
