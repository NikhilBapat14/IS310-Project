"Trump and his cronies are destroying America and democracy and it's only gonna get worse.  People seem to have forgotten all of the bulls\*\*t that he pulled in his first term and refused to listen to the warnings about how a bad of a disaster a second Trump would be and now they are gonna learn the hard way.  Trump and his evil cronies will be turning America into a fascist, dystopian idiocracy and this could have been prevented by not voting that disgrace back into office but some people just refused to listen and they never seem to learn.  Those who voted for Trump deserve all the bulls\*\*t that they will get from that traitor and his cronies.",Apprehensive_Idea758,2025-04-11T11:50:30,10
