"Dunno about the US, but thanks to trump the negative views of China around the world have softened a lot.  Not only that trump has single handedly hardened the world view of the US and painted the US as a no good pariah.",netsheriff,2025-04-23T17:12:52,22

"I mean China isn’t currently bombing the holy shit out of the Middle East or threatening to drag us into war with Iran. China isn’t resurrecting the coal industry to power AI. China isn’t openly threatening to take over fifty different countries. They’re mostly just hanging out, minding their own business. And I like that they’re tackling climate change.  From where I’m standing, China is much, much less of a threat than we are.",get-the-marshmallows,2025-04-23T17:20:46,8
"everyone in america has fallen victim to anti chinese propaganda,   i’ve spent many days trying to unlearn our propaganda that’s been instilled since i was a child.   ofc china still has its flaws, like the Tiananmen square massacre and censorship of lgbtq people as well as anything they deem “unfriendly” to kids ( it’s not about the children tbh but whatever that’s an excuse for every country atp. ).  but the america has completely skewed a lot of chinas flaws.",Akraxs,2025-04-23T18:17:10,5

Of course they've softened on China... as have the negative views of the rest of the world. Just look at what America is currently offering as the orange alternative.,phosdick,2025-04-24T10:05:21,1
"I mean, I think we should be careful to not fall into the same trap as republicans with Russia and improve our views on them simply because of the views of the opposition. That said, most of the problems with China are the CCP specifically and not the nation as a whole, trade is a mutually beneficial relationship and both sides are benefitting in a relatively equal measure for now because there's not that much disparity in wealth and power overall. US is still the dominant economic power for now though Trump is doing his best to change that, but we haven't reached the tipping point yet even though it's trending that way. Anyone who doesn't think the US is the strongest military power right now is a gibbering moron. The people who think the tariffs will have no real effect on them don't understand tariffs at all. Similarly, while I think the importance of the Taiwan conflict personally might be confusing with the wording, the sole fact of Taiwan's dominance in chip fabs means that it's frankly incredibly important it stays independent from China to literally everyone in America and saying otherwise just shows ignorance (unsurprising)",Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-23T17:27:35,0

The bad thing is that they're the superpower that doesn't act like a loose cannon right now. I'd echo many of the criticisms on this post and I'm very hawkish on China.

"I mean, a lot of China's commitment to climate change is largely smoke and mirrors with lots of fudged numbers and lies and chinese emissions have only been climbing. That said, they are investing a lot into green energy, but that's frankly less about climate change itself and more on getting a head start in a promising new sector (which is something any rational country would be doing if not for the strangling grasp of monied interests in the fossil fuel sector).",Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-23T17:31:00,-2
"Propaganda twists everything.   “During the cold war, the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime's atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn't go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them.” -  Michael Parent  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Parenti",skUkDREWTc,2025-04-23T20:35:20,5
"I think partially it's also because how we view China is so warped, the things we latch onto aren't even as big of a deal as we think they are. We talk about Tiananmen Square but nobody talks about Blair Mountain, MOVE bombing, etc.   This is not to even bring up the war crimes that America has perpetrated in other countries (My Lai, Highway of Death etc.)   Yeah, there's no need to censor it, but it's because we don't care about it at all. Chinese people don't bring it up every conversation when people are trying to make conversation about the US. But every time someone talks about China, you can bet your bottom dollar someone's gonna mention Tiananmen Square.   Truth be told, we don't give a shit about Tiananmen Square. We just use it as a way to dunk on China.",kid147258369,2025-04-24T01:13:17,3

Well something is happening. I’m not sure if Beijing air pollution is still at the same levels it previously was in the late 2000 and early 2010s. Their transition to EVs and electrification no doubt has a big impact.,Electrifying2017,2025-04-23T18:25:52,8

Really they make a lot of very aggressive movements and grabs of disputed territories across the entire region (there’s a reason so many east and southeast Asian countries hate them). China is an imperialist state same as US and both share the problems that entail. If there’s one big difference between the two right now it’s that the US can project it’s military might much further whereas China’s influence is much more confined to their own region in that respect at the moment though they’re working to change that,Ill_Act_1855,2025-04-23T18:41:08,2
