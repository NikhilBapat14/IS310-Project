LA ls increasing it‚Äôs tax credit to matchbor exceed Georgia‚Äôs & NY‚Äôs but Canada and Ireland both have no caps and work off of percentages.

How does it work If it's streamed on Netflix? Just the one tariff to bring the movie onto American servers?  That would be an interesting thought experiment with all the tech companies like Google who've been dodging taxes by offshoring their IP.,O918,2025-05-04T20:59:40,7
"They aren't. They can be taxed but a tariff is specifically a tax on trade of physical goods at a port of entry, this is just.. confusing nonsense. He's ether talking about trying to tariff digital transactions or.. services rendered in another country for a production company.

"They can probably tariff it when the theaters buy the movie from the studio (not sure if that's how it works). If the movie was filmed 70 percent at locations outside the US, it would be a 70 percent tariff.",ClaroStar,2025-05-04T20:39:41,-1
"None of that is under the purview of Tariffs, it's all ether IP rights stuff or sales done purely domestically. There is no point of entry trading going on between two countries there.

"I don't even think it's a problem that requires a solution.    Over half of Hollywood's revenue comes from other countries. Movies are a significant service export that the US has a massive surplus in, but he wants other countries to enjoy none of the benefits of what their citizens spend their money on. He is treating the production of this service export that has a surplus as if it is a physical good with a deficit.    It's just sad.

It‚Äôs certainly a problem for below the line film workers in the US who have seen their middle class union jobs shipped abroad because it‚Äôs cheaper to make a vancouver street look like LA than to just film in LA.

"How quickly could that be theoretically reshored? Like, if using production teams abroad for special effects or something leads to the movie being tariffed 100%, then all of that work needs to be done in the US? Is that even possible to get up and running?    It will also make production much more expensive, and so ticket prices more expensive, reducing sales.. So less risk-taking etc. There could simply be less work overall and studios only make ""sure things"", and that's not even considering what other countries may do to retaliate and crater Hollywood's revenues.",lipstickandchicken,2025-05-05T03:11:02,1

"It‚Äôs not the solution I agree.  It might be a combination of tax incentives and local laws.

There is the capacity to re-shore. The studio lots are all still there just unused. The crews are still in American cities.
