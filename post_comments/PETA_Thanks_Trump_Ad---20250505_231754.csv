"While it's positive that the Trump administration ended beagle testing at the NIH, let's not forget the context. This was a rare instance where their actions aligned with basic animal welfare, something they consistently disregarded in other areas.",FroyoOk6254,2025-05-05T23:23:02,30

"As usual,  the [right-wing extremists](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/)  at Breitbart are lying.  PETA did not thank the Trump Administration as claimed by those liars.  From PETA:  >Washington—After more than a decade of agitation, tens of thousands of emails to NIH officials from PETA supporters, and a 2021 landmark lawsuit, PETA welcomes the long-overdue news that NIH is canceling at least one of the appalling sepsis experiments that inflicted prolonged suffering on animals in federal and federally funded laboratories. Since 2013, PETA has argued for the complete termination of these cruel and scientifically worthless experiments on ALL animals—and we will continue to fight until every last one is ended. It is also critical to underscore that the beagles tormented and killed in these now-terminated painful experiments were purchased from Envigo. This notorious facility was shut down after PETA’s undercover investigation exposed the nightmarish conditions in which thousands of dogs were warehoused. PETA’s investigation led to the historic rescue of 4,000 dogs.  [PETA Applauds End to Cruel Sepsis Experiments on Beagles, Vows Continued Pressure to End All Sepsis Experiments on Animals: PETA Statement | PETA](https://www.peta.org/media/news-releases/peta-applauds-end-to-cruel-sepsis-experiments-on-beagles-vows-continued-pressure-to-end-all-sepsis-experiments-on-animals-peta-statement/)  It is  too early in the morning for Breitbart b.s.

"A fake story this didn’t happened, Petra has been working since 2019 to end this and it happened in 2022 which is where they get that picture for the story for.

Liberals will do anything but praise Trump for an action that is unanimously what the public wanted. Wonder why Biden or anyone in the democratic party didn't do this; I guess their actions never aligned with basic animal welfare.,rahrah1108,2025-05-08T11:30:55,1
