"Let's do some political math!  Let's say Canada becomes the 51st US state:  Populating of Canada: 40M  Population of California: 39M  So Canada would get 2 senators and 52 members of the house  Not bad, but can we do better?    Lets' figure it another way:  Canada has 10 provinces and three territories for a total of 13.  Let's say each province/territory is admitted as a separate state  That's + 26 senators for Canada, and (for simplicity) assume the same 52 members of the House.  That's better.  But we're not done yet...     Yet another way:  \- All 343 member of the Canada House of Commons become members of the US House  \- All 105 members of the Senate of Canada become members of the US Senate.
