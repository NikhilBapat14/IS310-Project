"The opposite, being added to the childhood vaccine schedule was based on **no randomized evidence** showing that children ever benefit in real clinical outcomes.  You need high quality evidence to *add* something to the vaccine schedule, not the other way around.  RFK sucks but this is his ~~broken~~ *dead* clock moment.  Run the RCT showing meaningful clinical outcomes for this demographic if it is to be justified.",iblamexboxlive,2025-04-24T20:37:03,1
