Democrats should literally just swear in a Texas Democrat. Break the fucking rules. Make the GOP play fair or not at all.,SoftwareHot,2025-04-04T01:38:05,15
Agree it should occur more timely. That said NY's Governor floated the same idea Texas put into effect.

I might just write a strongly worded comment suggesting you not use such foul language. You’ve been warned.,slobs_burgers,2025-04-04T00:59:16,13
"Article I, section 2 of the Constitution: “When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.” You’re wrong.",jwkpiano1,2025-04-03T23:28:08,15
"Ahh, but is there a time added to that? I don't see a time limit in there?   You might be wrong.  >House vacancies can be caused by death, resignation, declination, withdrawal, or House action, but the Constitution requires that they be filled by election. The law concerning Members elected to fill vacancies varies according to when the vacancy occurs and applicable state law.  >All states, territories, and districts require special elections to fill any vacant House seats during the first session of a Congress. During the second session of a Congress, however, procedures often vary depending on the amount of time between the vacancy and the next general election. Section 8 of Title 2, United States Code, provides that a state governor can cause a special election in extraordinary circumstances; namely, a crisis in which the number of House vacancies exceeds 100.  So, he can wait off until November if he wants for the normal yearly election cycle and only needs to issue a special election if he wants.",Abraxas_Templar,2025-04-04T09:54:28,0
