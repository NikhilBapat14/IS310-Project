I don't think most people realize how lucky they are that we have the amount of public land that we do. Imagine not being able to do anything outdoors related without knowing and or paying the billionaire who bought the national park or public land in your area.  That's if they are not closed for logging or oil drilling or turned into strip malls and suburbs.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T12:06:00,437

Trump’s version of the song “This land is my land” doesn’t have the second bar,zubuneri,2025-05-02T12:25:16,71
"America’s federal public lands are truly unique, part of our birthright as citizens. No other country in the world has such a system.  But during the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s second term, those lands have come under relentless attack. Despite broad, bipartisan public support for protecting public lands, the administration and its allies in Congress are looking to boost and fast-track drilling, mining, and logging across the federal estate — both for housing development and to help offset tax and spending cuts.  This is “probably the most significant moment since the Reagan administration in terms of privatization,” as one expert put it.  Understand what’s at stake: [https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/411272/public-lands-trump-administration-conservation-commonwealth](https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/411272/public-lands-trump-administration-conservation-commonwealth)",vox,2025-05-02T12:05:20,40
"What trump and his cronies are doing to America reminds me of what the corporate raiders of the 1980s did.  They would buy a big company, saddle it with debt, lay off workers, sell off profitable pieces of the company for cash, pay all the cash out to themselves as dividends, and then let the rump of the company go bankrupt and hand over the pension obligations to the federal government.",VanceKelley,2025-05-02T15:33:00,28
"Reagan was like minded. I remember Interior Secretary Watt in this context.  Among other things Reagan wanted to sell the Hoover Dam. He was foiled in that attempt, and the dam has continued to turn over revenue (from generating hydroelectric power) to the national treasury from that day to this. It is a real asset of the American people.  Republicans have been going after public lands and the resources in them, as well as assets like power generating dams for a long, long time.  This gang is different though. They are using the Russian model. When Russia turned to a free market economy, political insiders and people connected to the mob had the inside track to take over public assets for a fraction of their true value. Government functionaries (judges and clerks) who were responsible for the process and objected to what was happening had their lives threatened. Thugs would pay a visit.  Trump has always admired how the Russian mobsters and criminals pulled it all off, he got to know them and benefitted handsomely by the association, laundering immense amounts of their wealth for them and securing investment loans from well heeled Russian oligarchs when the legitimate banks turned him down.  Trump knows the opportunity before him, he has studied it, he knows what can be done here and pretty much how to do it. THAT is what we are up against, the raping and pillaging of the United States of America.",Hesychios,2025-05-02T15:06:50,14

I get it, humanity needs fossil fuels. Until we get alternatives, it's really all we got. But with DJT there is no halfway. He has to grab as much money as he can get his hands on before he kicks the bucket. The USA is just an abandoned candy store with him. He can't resist.

"  [The federal government owns large tracts of the western states](https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/291-federal-lands-in-the-us/): from a low of 29.9% in Montana, already more than the national average, up to a whopping 84.5% in Nevada.  According to the Congressional Research Service, a total area of just under 610 million acres – more than twice the size of Namibia – is administered by no more than 4 federal government agencies:  \* The United States Forest Service (USFS), which oversees timber harvesting, recreation, wildlife habitat protection and other sustainable uses on a total of 193 million acres – almost the size of Turkey – mainly designated as National Forests.  \* The National Park Service (NPS) conserves lands and resources on 80 million acres – a Norway-sized area – in order to preserve them for the public. Any harvesting or resource removal is generally prohibited.  \* the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), managing 248 million acres – an area the size of Egypt – has a multiple-use, sustained-yield mandate, supporting energy development, recreation, grazing, conservation, and other uses.  \* the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) manages 89 million acres – an area slightly bigger than Germany – to conserve and protect animal and plant species.  The first agency is part of the Department of Agriculture, the latter three of the Department of the Interior. The Department of Defense manages an additional 20 million acres – a bit larger than the Czech Republic – as military bases, testing and training grounds, etc.",kuzism,2025-05-03T08:23:32,1

"I live in England and honestly, I was shocked when I tried to go travel and camp around the countryside. Apart from a few tiny spots in national parks and even there, wild camping’s technically illegal most of the time. But at least no angry “farmers” to call police on you when they see you walk on their “property”. we couldn’t find anywhere we were actually allowed to set up a tent. Everywhere we looked, it was all private land, even if it was just empty fields. A lot of it’s labeled as “farmland,” but half the time it’s just grass with no one on it. So you have to book one of those camping spots on a farmland, pay like £100 for two nights.   I just googled and apparently only about 8% of the land in England is classed as “open access land” where you’re legally allowed to walk off-path. That’s it.

Heck, if there's timber on the lot, let people use the timber or sell some percentage of the timber from their lot to build their own homes.  This isn't to say we should be stripping down places like Yosemite to give to people to live privately. Heck, there's places like California city out there that have the starting infastructure but just need to be completed. TONS of land, places for companies to move into.

As I mentioned before, I'm pretty borderline communist, and heavily socialist, believing that the government has a duty to ensure housing keeps up with demand, and that this shouldn't be left to private individuals to moderate. I believe that utilities should be deprivatized, especially water and electricity as well as the government having the duty to ensure that appropriate infastructure is set up(The only exception I'm kinda on the fence about is internet service. Cell towers though should be nationalized specifically for access to emergency services), and I have no problem with taxes being raised to cover it if appropriate control over the runaway earnings of capitalists over their workers is reigned in, and the wage discrepancy between workers and owners/CEO's is brought down again to the point where someone working for $75k-$100k a year can afford to buy a home within reasonable commute to their place of work(less than 45 minutes drive(preferrably 30 or less imo), train, or other public transportaition ROUND TRIP. As well as remove the ability for corporations to own private residences, or for private residences to be owned as investment/unused properties by foreign nationals. IDC if this involves building up and having high rises with privately owned units or in more suburbs, but shit needs to get done, and if current homeowners are keeping us from building UP for this, then we need to build OUT.  We need less apartments unless each unit is able to be privately owned by an individual. We need less McMansions, and developers need to be encouraged to make smaller 2 bedroom or so 1500 or less square foot homes like they used to in the 50's-70's. I also believe in the viability of manufactured homes in areas not prone to tornadoes as a low cost alternative to traditional building. Currently, there is too much promoting the evergrowing size of private residences that are just snatched up by Blackrock or people who use homes as investment pieces for any developer to want to build anything smaller, or invest in anything besides rentables that they can hyperinflate prices to because they collude with other rental companies to rig an ever-growing rent market.",Ansiau,2025-05-02T14:34:04,1

"> believing that the government has a duty to ensure housing keeps up with demand, and that this shouldn't be left to private individuals to moderate.  So government housing blocks, not just affordable housing or section 8 but apartments wholesale owned by the government? That could work but would result in lots of vacant units unless you wanted to force people to move there. You could probably supplement this with rent to own homes and apartments while having permanent gov service ones there to fill in those who cant or wont do that. Essentially have ""temporary"" housing and a waitlist for rent to own options, that way there are not to many units just vacant and you get more people towards home ownership. It would make it more palatable I think.  >I believe that utilities should be reprivatized, especially water and electricity as well as the government having the duty to ensure that appropriate infrastructure is set up (The only exception I'm kind of on the fence about is internet service. Cell towers though should be nationalized specifically for access to emergency services  Agreed, although interestingly not all utilities are privatized, for example our water here is all run by a special district created by an interlocal agreement from surrounding counties. The history behind it is basically all the counties were fighting over who supplied Later to certain areas and this was their solution to resolve it (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Water).  Hard agree when it comes to utility companies, TECO is alright service wise but the fact they are both foreign owned (security risk) profit off of us and some like Duke energy even raised their prices after the storms when people were struggling sucks. They also lobbied our state gov to reduce the rebates and financial benefits to individuals with solar because it was costing them is super slimy.  I would say if we are going to include cell towers then internet should be included too, especially if you are talking about establishing communities in remote areas, it opens up more employment opportunities and is just becoming an ever increasing necessity of life these days.   >buy a home within reasonable commute to their place of work(less than 45 minutes drive(preferrably 30 or less imo)  This is where things get tricky, at least in my area most large tracts of land are farms, which we need to eat stuff, or specifically set up for conservation, and these usually wetlands to boot. so we need to focus more on redeveloping current areas to include more mixed use housing, creating both walkable neighborhoods and reducing environmental impacts.  Now what we need less of (and tying into your next points) is sprawling suburbs. Every single new build community I see is some massive web of 2500-3000 square foot homes with no trees and hardly any native plants and like maybe one shared space but its a playground so it only helps if you have a kid. This doesnt do anything to foster communities that actually interact and care for each other, it drives the cost of everything around it up, and it takes up a ton of resources for not much gain (they also freak me out in a stepford wives way). Further they usually come at the expense of more affordable homes that were napped up by some big developer for the land, which otherwise would have been great affordable starter homes.   It also makes it much harder to find land for libraries, parks, conservation, fire stations, schools, ect and puts more demand to on the systems since the more sprawl there is the harder it is for existing places to service those areas effectively and drives up property tax to start covering the cost. Remember communities arent just homes, its all the services needed for it to function. Developers do generally pay to put in utilities and bring roads up to standard, add turn lanes ect., but they wont pay for like miles of road to connect to a main artery, and roads are expensive af (seriously https://www.fdot.gov/programmanagement/estimates/reports/cost-per-mile-models-reports)  so this is a cost to consider.    But a big problem, with any housing, but also subdivisions being built in these previously rural areas is traffic. No one wants to pay for road expansion on planned growth so they wait until the local two lane road is jammed with traffic and everyone is complain to try to expand, only now the land has gone up in value and it costs more to do so.   Fully agree if you couldn't tell that we need less mcmansions, and more starter home style homes in general. I and many others dont need or want a 2000+ square foot home, I just want a guest room and a yard to garden in, its just me and my cat.   Manufactured homes can work, but you would have to be careful to avoid what often happens in parks, you own the home, but not the lot and pay a lot fee. It doesn't sound to bad until they raise the fees or evict  you and if you cant up and move the home so you lose that too. Black rock has actually been investing in these too funny enough. You could probably get a solution to that by having new parks be co-ops instead of owned by private companies. Maybe with check-ins or reports going up to an appropriate gov office to review and make sure things are hunky dory.   And speaking of Blackrock, yes, we need to get large corporations out of home ownership. I have no problem with renting in general, I rent because I do not want to own a home at this particular time and I could never afford one in the neighbor hood I am in. Rentals do fill a role and not all landlords are bloodsuckers, my individual ones have been great, big corps or even medium though have always sucked ass.
