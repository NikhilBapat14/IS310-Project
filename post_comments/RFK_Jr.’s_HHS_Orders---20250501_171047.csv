Straight up insanity.  How can anyone lead any organization when they don't believe in what it does?  They never could and it always turns out badly for everyone involved.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-05-01T17:11:41,45

Not insanity; that was the goal. Install people at the heads of various agencies that would actively sabotage those agencies. The end goal is to privatize as much of the government as possible.

"It's crossed my mind a few times that between 2020 and 2024 Trump heard the comments that he would easily have won a second (consecutive) term if he'd approached the COVID pandemic properly, so now he's hoping for a do-over to fill that hideous, desperate need for adoration that he's crippled with.",4ivE,2025-05-01T17:20:36,10

"You know, I have had a few tell me that the world is overpopulated.  And those few are rural people here that believe that if an ""illness of biblical proportions"" hit it would help eliminate the plague that is the liberal cities.  I mean, i am sure there are others that believe this.  True, it is harder for big city people to make it in those instances given that resources are more limited if not trucked in.  And being so close together any living populations are much more likely to spread disease.       Even hurting the economy badly will have serious consequences like this.  And they really want our government to fail and install things how they want them.  And for most MAGA it will not be how they think or want.  Many of them will be on the outside.",GuerreroUltimo,2025-05-01T17:37:02,4
"Tin foil hat thought: Let disease run rampant, then ensure only ""the right people"" get access to treatment.

We're still technically in a pandemic globally for Covid and I'll be shocked if there's not a bird flu or some other new pandemic before 2029. Just look at the measles cases alone. That doesn't even get into the FDA cuts that will harm the ability to keep our food and drugs safe... We're probably fucked.,tellmewhenimlying,2025-05-01T17:20:24,2

Based on the assumption that everything these guys try to take credit for or blame the opposition for is exactly the opposite of what's happening... Bondi recently claimed that Trump has saved over 230 million American lives JUST IN HIS FIRST 100 days in office.  So I'd assume they're trying to kill off around 3/4 of the population based on this.,CockBrother,2025-05-01T19:49:43,1
"Might be misconstrued on that one. From my understanding, the 230 mil number came from fentanyl seizures (or maybe projected figures) and extrapolated how many lethal doses were potentially available.   It's basically the same as putting up a ""no guns allowed"" sign on a school, and claim you stopped a shooting",FrostyFreeze_,2025-05-02T00:01:26,1
So you're saying fentanyl is how they're going to do it. Introduced through vaccinations or chem trails? Hmmm....   Apologies. It sounds like you're being a straight shooter on this topic and I was not.,CockBrother,2025-05-02T05:05:20,1
