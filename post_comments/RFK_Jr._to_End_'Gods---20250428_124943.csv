Trump wants more people to die from fentanyl overdoses so he can justify more draconian measures to “stop the flow of fentanyl into the country.” ,Donkletown,2025-04-28T14:20:19,11
I’m trained on Narcan. My city offered free training lessons and I figured it was something to do on a random weekend.   The amount of drugs that are being laced are incredibly high. It’s so bad that the trainers are even working with restaurants and bars in the area to help them keep Narcan stocked behind the counters in case someone goes into an overdose while there.   Why would they want to cut programs like this that quite literally are saving lives while waiting for EMS to arrive? This is as confusing as if someone said they wanted to remove all AEDs or fire extinguishers from public locations.   Death is the driving factor here. They want more death.,ACasualRead,2025-04-28T14:05:27,18

I teach community and healthcare CPR and First Aid a lot. With every class I try to bring enough Narcan for every attending person to take one if they would like to after training. I rarely leave with any extra. Just this morning I talked to my contact and said I would need #80 to cover my classes up through June 3rd. We then laughed when I just added in two more classes with 22 people which puts me over #100. Now here I am seeing this.   So many of my students know somebody who passed away because the people around them did not have Narcan. I've had a few students who admitted the person I knew was family; none of them were able to tell me that information without being near tears. I teach at a high school that lost an honor student near graduation last year because the weed she was smoking was tainted and nobody knew there was a problem nor did they have Narcan until it was too late. I have been so proud to watch the number of overdose deaths go down and know that in a very tiny way I was helping that! Just reading this was devastating. I don't really have more words than that. I just feel a bit devastated and remember what classes were like when I couldn't teach about that nor pass it out. It's not like people aren't going to talk about it anyway in class - drug overdoses are a First Aid skill. I just won't have a lot of hope and help when this program is gone. My brain is full of all the swears at the moment.,IyearnforBoo,2025-04-28T15:20:46,7

"As a former user and as someone who both witnessed and experienced the horrors of opioid addiction, this is a travesty. There's absolutely no justification for it.  Kennedy struggled with heroin addiction for at least 14 years, so you'd think he would know better, but nah, his solution to reducing overdose deaths is to put an end to a program that has saved tens, if not hundreds of thousands of lives, and has directly contributed to a near [24 percent decline in overdose deaths](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-reports-decline-in-us-drug-overdose-deaths.html).   Even if he thinks the distribution of Narcan/naloxone isn't addressing the ""root causes"" of addiction, it was never meant to. Narcan is often given to those currently seeking treatment, it is not supposed to replace community support and treatment programs.  However, Narcan is also made available to those not undergoing treatment as well as friends and relatives who know someone who is abusing opioids. Hell, even strangers have access to Narcan, which can mean the difference between life and death for someone ODing.  In other words, there's absolutely no reason to end the program when you can both continue to distribute Narcan *and* address the ""root causes"" of addiction, which many programs already exist to do in practice.  Keep in mind that this is coming from someone who has faced little to no consequences for his addiction.  For instance, Kennedy was once caught shooting up heroin in an airplane bathroom. He ended up passing out and disrupting the flight, only to later receive a suspended sentence for heroin possession because of his last name.

"I've lost count of how many people I know who have died... and there's many more who would be dead if it weren't for Narcan. When we found my brother-in-law OD'd I performed CPR on him until the ambulance arrived. I looked in his eyes and thought he was dead. I left the room when they arrived and they gave him narcan. 15 minutes later he walked down the stairs like nothing.  I couldn't believe it. Narcan saves lives everyday.  Unfortunately this moron and the current administration don't think addicts lives are worth saving. They want addicts, the disabled, homeless and poor to die off.",That_Girl_Cray,2025-04-28T18:40:54,6

"That’s actually crazy. We had a policy in CVS Pharmacy that anyone can just walk through the door and request Narcan. No script needed, no background check, no fuss.

"The Washington Post got their hands on a preliminary budget document that calls for deep cuts to federal health programs and targets multiple additional prevention and treatment programs, “Including training of community responders to administer Narcan”.  so it’s a pre-decisional doc that hasn’t been finalized or enacted yet, and still up for changes.    They only mention ""cuts to the training of administering of Narcan.""  Also, most state and local governments have alternative resources than federal programs they go through to obtain Narcan.  So if deaths are down, and partially attributed to the Narcan program, and most responders are familiar with how to administer it, or the new hires get local training from their co-workers, it would seem reasonable to cut federal dollar for training on the Narcan program.    But the news outlets are spinning this like this administration wants all  druggies dead.  Just 4 days ago RFK spoke in Nashville stating:  “We have to do all of the nuts-and-bolts things that you are all involved with,” he told the crowd. “The practical, pragmatic things. We need suboxone. We need methadone. We need naltrexone.”  He also advocated for access to other measures outside of medication-assisted treatment.  “We need Narcan,” he said, referring to the overdose reversal drug. “We need good fentanyl detectors that can detect it in pills, et cetera, so that kids are less likely to overdose. We need prevention.”  If there are more cuts to the Narcan Program, then we need to see documents, not just spin and hype.",Magnum0970,2025-04-28T17:49:43,3

Distributing free narcan kits to people who use opioids and their families (as my jurisdiction does) absolutely saves lives, especially in places (like almost all of the US), where people who use opioids do not have access to overdose prevention sites. Also important to note the crucial lifesaving role of narcan for people who use opioids who are not addicted as those people face a risk of overdose death but cannot benefit from medications for opioid use disorder. Further, there is no risk to distributing narcan: It cannot be used for intoxication and the risk of adverse events is low. This decision will cost lives.

"Might be the unpopular opinion but I was a manager for a hotel in a VERY drug riddled, SUPER touristy city in the States.   We had multiple OD related deaths while the fentanal  epidemic was on the rise. Even had to have local PD come to give us all a safety meeting should housekeeping run across unknowns while cleaning a room. (People would hide their stash and check out of the room, go make money, then try and re rent the same room)   My boss and PD asked if I wanted to keep narcan on-site. I stated only for use of my staff if they felt like they were cleaning rooms that need it. Some of the housekeepers were mad at me for saying that. Stating that I should have said yes, until I asked what would happen on my time off? If I'm the only one trained, all it would take is one person to spread that i give narcan at my hotel. Then everyone would just come party at mine, then without fail someone would OD while I was not there. People would have been screaming at my staff to do something they can't (not allowed to touch guest for any reason- just having me trained for it would have needed SO MUCH APPROVAL) and calling me all hours even more than already. I would have felt responsible and tried to race there and would put ALL LIABILITY on my employer. Their OD would be seen as my staffs fault for not giving it.   Lemme tell ya guys. We all hurt when we found a body. We all found our own ways to deal with a death at 1130am and clean and resell that rm by the end of day. That community ""posts"" or lives in hotels like that. We knew their whole families- crap they rented the room next door 1/2 the time. NONE OF US signed up to be a sponsor or to have to add ""saving a life"" to the amities our hotel offered.   While i do think it should be available and affordable. I also think that it should be controlled. I saw 1st hand people that just kept their own right next to the locked and loaded needle in their ""fix kits."" Just used as a ""get out of jail free"" ""don't have to take responsibility"" type of item rather than anything that has rehabilitation uses in average people's hands.

"It’s definitely a “those prevented deaths should have just been deaths because the addicts are weak” mentality. Talk with anyone conservative, even if they’re like your 75yo mee-maw, who is super kind, volunteers at the soup kitchen, runs clothing drives for the houseless, etc… get them talking long enough about drug addiction and you will inevitably get a “if they choose to let their addiction take their life, it’s their own fault, look at all the help we try to give them to get clean!”   They don’t look at addiction (especially the very unpalatable in-public crippling addiction that leads to ODs) as a mental health issue. Conservatives look at it as a failure of character. A moral failing which some people are “too weak” to overcome.  Side note: not endorsing this view. I do not share it. But you can see it in people’s “bridge too far” of seeing something in public that squicks them out. Its disgust. Some people’s valence for that is as low as like, young people dressing too immodestly, and some people have a ton of grace and the line is drawn waaay up at overdosing in front of a school bus stop, but the reaction is the same, they’re disgusted, and they want the problem to go away. Not be solved, not be helped, just gone.  You can have arguments on where society permits that line to be through law, look at any NIMBY sub, and you’ll see that through line argument about houseless people; but the arguments are semantic, do something that disgusts someone, and you are “that thing” not a person anymore, and they don’t want to see you.",noncongruency,2025-04-28T15:59:26,1

As for stealing, that only happens because the drugs and their analogues are out of financial reach of most people.
