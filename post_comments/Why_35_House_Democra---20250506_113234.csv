"Affordable EVs can be built, they just won't sell them in the US. Instead of trying to get more affordable  vehicles, Democrats vote with Republicans to make things worse. Figure out why we cant get cheap EVs, Democrats. Take the Nissan N7, for example:  >The Nissan N7, which will be produced with partner Dongfeng, will be offered with a choice of 58- and 73-kWh batteries, with the latter promising a range of 395 miles in the somewhat optimistic CLTC cycle. The shorter-range variant will offer 316 miles, based on the same cycle.  >For what is meant to be an affordable electric sedan, the N7 won't skimp on luxury features, offering a refrigerated compartment below the front center arm rest that can cool drinks below the freezing point, while also being able to warm them up as needed.  >The seats also feature 12-point massage functionality and for drivers, a pneumatic cushion mechanism offers up to 60 mm extension, providing optimal leg comfort and support,"" Nissan notes.  >The N7 will start at 160,000 yuan, which translates to about $21,950.  >By this point it is painfully obvious that the US market is far from being a top priority for Japanese automakers' electric offerings, and for German automakers as well when it comes to smaller, more affordable models.  >What's more, Automotive News reported a few days ago that Nissan has scrapped plans for building two electric sedans stateside, citing a shrinking sedan segment. Nissan has signaled that the pricing of such sedans in North America would likely put them out of reach of its customer base.

Because they are traitors. The Democratic party must be torn down and replaced with true opposition. No remnants of the establishment should remain.  I will not vote for anyone who willingly works with the Republicans. Full stop.,akaisuiseinosha,2025-05-06T12:33:05,5

"Of course that makes sense. I understand that’s how you were able to keep Kamala from being elected. Better a fascist in power than a weak sister. Until there’s an effective determined opposition, it’s much better to keep electing Republicans and their supporters. This way Americans will see how bad it can get and they will vote for a clear alternative. This generation doesn’t remember what it was like not to have any legal protections and rights for our marginalized groups and POC. So once they’re all taken away they’ll be more likely to vote against the GOP. So good plan, keep up the good work. 🤦🏼‍♂️",johnn48,2025-05-06T18:14:25,1

"In other words you have such high standards that anyone who casts a meaningless vote (the Republicans had the votes without them) that disappoints you is a ""fascist collaborator"" and rather than voting for someone like that you'd rather *live under the regime of an actual fascist who is rapidly destroying our democracy and making it impossible to achieve progressive goals for decades.*   Note that AOC doesn't take that self-defeating stance. In one interview she talked about the importance of supporting Biden -- *even in the face of stark disagreement over his handling of the Gaza genocide* -- because of how deeply destructive a second Trump administration would be.   She was right. That's because she's smart, she's pragmatic, she understands how our political system works, she understands how destructive a fascist regime can be, *and she wants to achieve progressive goals.*",KingKrasnov,2025-05-06T13:28:11,2

"What do the Democrats gain by being complicit, if the vote would pass anyway? Who are they trying to appeal to, here?  For reference, Republicans vote party line against their own best interests every time, because they can always lie about it later and their voters have the memory of goldfish. The same does not apply to Democrat voters.  So why be complicit in something they'll win anyway?",Sweary_Biochemist,2025-05-06T16:00:26,6
"Take a step back and look around you. Everything that is being destroyed, torn-down or used inappropriately is not just the fault of Republicans.  If Democrats did their jobs, Republicans would not even have a foothold, never mind the whole damn show.   Rule 1 to understanding the shitstorm we are in is to understand why people voted to set themselves on fire. Yes, it is because propaganda is powerful, but also because Democrats never put out a countervailing argument as to why government is good and necessary. They never stood up and said they would use the power of the government to lift up the poor, abused and weak against the forces of wealth, strength and power.  As prices on everything climbed, Democrats didn't suggest using the power of government to break up the monopolies and oligopolies strangling our food supply. Democrats claim to want to help the poor, but only offer the bare minium when they are handed control.  Look at what Democrats did in this vote. They signaled to their base that they will not stand up against corporate interests to save the environment. There is an affordability problem with EVs but, like mass school shootings, it is a uniquely American problem. Other countries have affordable EV's with long range and even a bunch of added crap that does not need to be there. Democrats should be focusing on why there are no affordable EVs, instead of accepting there is nothing that can be done and voting with Republicans on the issue.  The answer to why we can't have nice things is usually because of Wall Street, and that is the answer to EVs as well. Ford made it clear over the past year, they can either build vehicles that meet Wall Street's expectation for income, or they can build affordable EVs, but they can't do both. Ford, like all the manufacturers, has a duty to maximize profits, and so they will build giant SUVs and trucks with massive price tags that guarantee a hefty profit on each one sold. They would rather sell fewer expensive items than many inexpensive ones because Wall Street finds that safer.   Every time Democrats gave into Wall Street's demands, they ceded a part of their power to Republicans, until Republicans were able to wage a campaign to remove all progressive legislation within months of Trump gaining power. The fact that they would vote with Republicans even in a ""meaningless"" vote shows they still don't care to defend anyone who is not Wall Street.",pgm_01,2025-05-06T14:05:05,2

"What exactly are you advocating? Are you agreeing with the other guy's ""don't vote for a Democrat who ever cast a disappointing vote""?  > Ford made it clear over the past year, they can either build vehicles that meet Wall Street's expectation for income, or they can build affordable EVs, but they can't do both.  Are you saying that if Ford were a non-profit rather than for-profit corporation their cars could be cheaper? Or what?  > Ford, like all the manufacturers, has a duty to maximize profits,   And investors who wouldn't be investors if they could make better profits by investing elsewhere.
