"thanks for replying to this same post like 20 god damn times.       But that's just it, it's so broad.  It doesnt say guys wearing fake exposed breasts.  It just says breasts.  A shirt makes it so the nipples arent visible, but the breasts still are. They are two damn lumps without a binder or a burka they are always ""visible"" Just not naked or exposed.     Which means a woman wearing a shirt, trans or no with to visible lumps can be arrested if the costs so choose.  Hence my point of it directly targets anyone with breasts.  Just a cursory glance at some clothing stores   [warning ""visible"" breasts](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/st-johns-bay-womens-plus-scoop-neck-sleeveless-tank-top/ppr5008302811?pTmplType=regular&deptId=dept20000013&catId=cat1009690001&urlState=%2Fg%2Fwomen%2Fwomens-plus-size%2Fplus-tops%3Fid%3Dcat1009690001&productGridView=medium&badge=onlyatjcp)     [Hot topic disney pirate booba](https://www.hottopic.com/product/her-universe-disney-pirates-of-the-caribbean-pirate-cold-shoulder-dress/33371464.html)     [Torrid, gyat damn Torrid](https://www.torrid.com/brands/nightfall/shop-all/?srsltid=AfmBOoolTO54j_fqjwA4LTbGgpP1jboeMo_BHFZK-QFWK6m43UieG_kt)     Clearly those 3 examples you can see see the breasts even though they are not naked.  Basically the law is so vague since it doesnt say ""Exposed"" or ""Naked""  Which means its up to whatever puritan interpretation they want at the time.",trollsong,2025-04-28T13:38:58,4
