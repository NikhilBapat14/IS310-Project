"I've never seen a Regime in our country so hell-bent on making their constituents so completely miserable. I've never seen a Regime in our country that was so determined to make everyone and anyone globally miserable- that they possibly can. It's like making misery just FUELS them. It's horrible, and ghastly, and I just don't see how anyone can compare them to the Biden Administration. Unreal.",Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-04-21T16:44:41,45
"Except all student loans were given to the small business administration, voiding all contracts signed by borrowers before 2025.  I didn’t sign paperwork with the American government, I signed with the DoEd. They can’t change terms without my knowledge or signature, which they did when they gave up the loans.",annaleigh13,2025-04-21T16:07:04,31
Involuntary? Like just take the money out of your bank account(s)? Garnish wages?,mrcorndogman33,2025-04-21T19:06:24,7
"Involuntary? That doesn't sound good. Time to pack your bugout bags, there coming for you. Why is this clown still in office, haven't people had enough yet? Take your country back ffs.",cherieSniper,2025-04-21T18:50:56,7
My student loans have been in deferment for years due to income restrictions. Without notice my deferment was ended and my credit dropped 60 points over night.,tmehaffy,2025-04-21T20:17:27,4
I imagine Trump has also gutted programs that qualified for student loan forgiveness.,Confident_End_3848,2025-04-22T09:20:23,1
How many times did we warn them?,Thumbkeeper,2025-04-23T07:48:12,1

"While you may technically be right, good luck arguing that in court.   That’s like saying you signed your mortgage paperwork with “xxx” lender, but they sold it to another lender and arguing that you don’t owe that new lender.     This whole situation is stupid and sucks for all of us with student loans, but not sure anyone gets around this.",whitingvo,2025-04-21T16:12:26,18
"Yes, if you are defaulted on your student loans after 270 days they can be garnished directly from your wages. It’s limited to 15% of disposable wages that they can do without permission from a court. So I don’t think they are trying to do anything new, just resume those garnishments that were already in place and had been stopped under Biden while he was trying to forgive what he could.",SeanWithAnX,2025-04-21T19:33:42,4
"Federal student loans garnishing your paychecks when in default is not new to the trump administration, it was paused under Biden.  That's not to say I don't absolutely despise trump, or particularly like this, but we should be correct with our information and pick our battles. Returning to the norm with student loans should be a non story with the rights abuses we're seeing right now. If everything's a five alarm fire, there's no way to signal when it actually IS a five alarm fire (Kilmar Abrego Garcia MUST be returned to The United States, and his family must be compensated to be made whole, we should be begging and pleading for forgiveness as a nation)",JussaPeak,2025-04-22T21:45:00,1
"The people reveling in this the most are the bottom tier shitsuckers of society.  They never had anything because they've never been competent enough to EARN anything, so they're just happy to watch everything burn under the mistaken impression they'll get to see the aftermath.",Old_Baldi_Locks,2025-04-21T23:16:27,9
"There’s more to it, however. Federal student loans cannot be sold or transferred. While they can be managed by a third party, the payments go to the DoEd. Private loans can be bought and transferred, which is the difference between the two.",annaleigh13,2025-04-21T16:21:36,13
"I agree with you, but current status of the govt and courts will make this very very difficult to challenge.",whitingvo,2025-04-21T16:22:58,9
