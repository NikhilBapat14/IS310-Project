"From reporter David Moye:  JD Vance attempted a charm offensive on Tuesday, and failed with the charm while succeeding in being offensive.  It happened during an announcement that former Donald Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’s son, Andrew Giuliani, would be leading a task force for the 2026 World Cup, which will take place in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.

"There are new rules for people staying longer than 30 days. I don't expect ANY of the Canadian snowbirds to return to the US next fall.  # Key Takeaways  * Starting April 11, 2025, non-U.S. citizens aged 14+ staying over 30 days must register with USCIS using Form G-325R. * Registrants must create a USCIS online account, submit personal and biometric info, and carry proof; penalties apply for non-compliance. * Exemptions include lawful permanent residents, short-term visitors (<30 days), and some groups like American Indians born in Canada.  As of March 27, 2025, the United States will introduce new rules for non-U.S. citizens who plan to stay in the country for more than 30 days. These changes are part of a broader effort by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve national security and monitor foreign nationals residing temporarily in the country. The key component of this policy requires certain non-U.S. citizens to formally register with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). These updates have sparked discussions among affected groups, particularly long-term visitors like Canadian snowbirds .",No_Philosopher_1870,2025-05-06T19:00:05,109

"The United States of America is a good country (despite its many, many faults). I am proud to call it my home.

Now our government delights in suffering, kidnaps dissenters and makes them disappear under the guise of ‘immigration’, defers all branches of power to the executive office like some dictatorship. Instead of trying to catch up to these more progressive nations we’re are actively choosing to regress ourselves.   The heart breaking thing is that 70m+ people wanted this. They also did not appreciate the good things about America. Either because they were too stupid to realize what they were doing or also had so much hate in their heart that they actively wanted this. My mother’s boss voted for Trump because she ‘wanted cheaper eggs’… Doesn’t get more moronic than that. Who knows if that was her real reason anyway.   TL;DR: This administration is ruining what little good was left of America and I hate them for it. ",hillside126,2025-05-07T08:04:15,3

"Because they're reactionaries who see society as a moral and social hierarchy, i.e. we are and we are better than those we look down on because of who we are and we should be privileged above others. This implies authoritarianism, where status and power are the same thing, and prompts them to make the social hierarchy they feel should exist real by exercising power over other people. Since harming others without recourse is a pure form of power over them, they invariably gravitate towards that. By making ""the other"" suffer they place him beneath them, elevating themselves into a position of privilege and status.  Reactionary thought always leads to this because it is fundamentally opposed to growth, change and equality, which it considers perversions of the ""natural"" order, leading to a zero-sum worldview where the only way to gain, win or even express anything is by harming ""the other"". And since this is purely an emotional thing, people can fall into this dynamic without ever understanding or even articulating it; all they need to do is feel certain emotions about people who are different.  The xenophobia on display here is simply one aspect of this. Racism, misogyny, anti-LGBTQ bigotry, ""techbro"" culture, ..., are others, all operating in broadly the same way with different in and out groups. It's not a coincidence that  they all found one another in the same authoritarian movement. Compared to these others, being nasty to tourists is relatively inconsequential in the harm that it will do, but it speaks to the same feelings, fills the same need for those who are open to this particular message.",barryvm,2025-05-07T05:55:17,3

"There were two moments on my honeymoon in the US that broke my heart for that place, despite it overall being the most amazing trip I’ve ever done filled with people who were just generally excited we’d chosen to visit their area for our honeymoon.  Now I’ll preface with the fact I’m white, so I’m sure that impacted these interactions a lot.  First was in Austin, I’d gone out in the morning to buy coffee for my wife. While I’m waiting, and having a smoke outside, an older African American gentleman approached me real hesitantly with what looked like genuine fear asking if I could please google a tow truck company’s number as he didn’t have internet on his phone. I’m not a big scary dude by any means so it was a bit weird how fearful he was… my wife suggested he probably initially thought I was a white American and possibly armed (and his request could definitely be interpreted as some kinda scam to grab my phone or whatever)… anyway as soon as he heard me speak he immediately dropped the fear and asked me where I was from etc and then went on his way.  The second was a real southern white guy in a bar in Louisiana, that had never left the county we were in, and insisted I take an illegal (for me) handgun from him as I was heading to all these big cities (New York, Chicago, Boston) and my wife was going to definitely get raped and me killed if I couldn’t protect myself",GhettoFreshness,2025-05-07T00:43:54,36

"That's a misunderstanding how racism really works.  The Nazis didn't believe that 'aryans' were just literally better at everything, but that humanity was divided into different 'races' with different attributes. Their ideology claimed that the 'aryan race' was destined to rule over the others due to superior intelligence and culture, while slavs and black people would work for them with their assumed 'innate' physical strength and endurance.  Racists often do not argue that black people couldn't win, but that they were too 'brutish' compared to the 'gentlemanly' white athletes and that their presence would therefore 'degrade the sports'. They assumed that whites would win in 'sophisticated' sports due to their intelligence and culturedness, not that they were physically superior.  So the Nazis had no problem with fitting Jesse Owens phenomenal performance into their ideology.  You can see the same patterns today. Racists can't dispute that black people can be phenomenal athletes, so they instead disparage the *character* of black athletes and their sports.",Roflkopt3r,2025-05-07T01:42:05,21

"Well, the world saw a delicious taste of Canadian “smooth nasty” when your new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, was in the Oval Office with President DingDong.   Carney schooled the self-proclaimed supposed master of the “Art of the Deal” with a negotiation 101 tactic —- Carney knew when the subject of DingDong wanting to make Canada the 51st state was brought up, DingDong wouldn’t take a simple “no” from Carney, and there would likely be a “yes it will be,” “no it won’t” back and forth disagreement.   Carney pulled out a tried and true negotiation tactic and he completely showed DingDong who the actual “Art of the Deal” expert is, especially when it comes to diplomacy.   The tactic is when you have a point to make and you know the other person is likely to say “no,” or disagree, you make two points that you know the other person will agree with — it makes them nod, say yes twice, then you make the third point, and the other person is already nodding, smiling, agreeing, saying “yes, that’s true.” DingDong fell for it hook line and sinker, and his body language — the look on his face and how he slumped forward — damn.

"it is fine in that you can do what you want. but its also transparently fucking stupid if you were to speak more literally and without generalizations.   like if you want to visit peru because you heard they had a cool food and never leave a posh neighborhood god bless you.  if you say 'i dont need to learn quechua that whole culture is fucking useless' i might have some comment lol.    i know it is serving as a sort of metaphorical language so dont intend it to be more significant a complaint but those kind of half truths have a way of sticking in your mind in ways you dont expect.  like that trope that in america 400 years is a long time and in europe 400 miles is a long distance.  theres a truth under it but if taken literally its just straight white supremacist.     there are 8 indigenous languages spoken within a couple hours of where i live, people can walk up to cultural sites their ancestors used 4000 years ago and see ceremonial objects they still use today.  near me there is a petroglyph that is the oldest hard evidence for astronomical data in the western hemisphere.  its a chart of the orbit of venus and examined literally suggests mesoamerica  astronony began in the great basin.  down the road from there is a symbol that is the oldest example of a symbol found on the aztec calendar, dates to about 500 bc when nahua ancestors lived here.    idk seems kinda cool and maybe of interest to more than just me.  like i could tell you i live in utah and you have an idea of what that means but 90% of that perception is just what media youve consumed even if you live here a few years. or an entire lifetime for incurious people.  ",Funny-Mission-2937,2025-05-07T14:15:46,1

"Oof. Could not watch all of that. That was getting painful. XD  In all seriousness, I can't understand how anyone could be a low-information voter in this country. I mean, especially with Trump around. Ten years ago? Yeah, okay, fine. But the man has literally sucked so much oxygen out of the room (atmosphere?) that we're all basically lying on the floor, laughing, gasping for air as we suffocate. It's like that scene in Battlestar Galactica, only planet-wide. Like what is your fucking homepage that you could not be sucked up into this?  And maybe that's what it is! Maybe we are all asphyxiating. I remember a Kimmel bit before the election where they were asking people questions on the street, and the sheer lack of awareness (like literally talking about voting for people that have not been alive for a hundred years, much less on the ballot!), well it's the sort of thing you would expect from someone who is suffering oxygen deprivation while trying to remember their phone number or something, three seconds before they thunk on the ground.  But back to all seriousness - the lady mentioned she was in school, and she looked youngish. I think about Trump's weird-ass speech at the Alabama commencement, and the cheers he was getting. College kids are... well, a lot of them are pretty ignorant, for the most part (source: trust me, I could blow your mind with some of the stories I could tell...) and still pretty self-centered, as children are wont to be. Still have those under-developed prefrontal cortexes, have relatively minor exposure to economic issues because a lot of them aren't paying for shit yet, come from a youth where their only real exposure to anything political is what their parents have said. It takes a... well a college education... to help a lot of them grow past that. And hey, I was that kid once too. I voted for Nader. Twice. I wasn't in Florida, so I'm in no way about to take responsibility for *that*, and I still like Ralph Nader, but I recognize the conceit in retrospect. I'll forgive myself that one. Not the Jnco jeans though. Lordy...  The voting age is 18. The drinking age is 21. We decided a very long time ago that someone below 21 is not capable of even the potential to make rational decisions while drinking. So we cut that off. But those same people, that we have so little faith in to be able to know when to drink and not to drink in fear that they will harm themselves and others, we allow them to vote, knowing full well that they're fully capable - and more than that, likely - of making that first errant mistake in the context of drinking. But we still allow them to make that first errant mistake while voting for three full years before we trust them enough to drink, knowing full well that they could cause harm to themselves and others via their vote. That's fucking weird, right?!  Not advocating raising or lower drinking and/or voting ages, btw. But it's definitely food for thought. We are clearly aware of how thoughtless, impulsive and antagonistic for the sake of antagonism our youth can potentially be. In the case of that kiddo, I imagine you could change her mind pretty easily, probably one way or the other. She's clearly embarrassed after she has the idiotic notion to set herself up to be roasted by a comedian. She clearly did not think that through. She was just living in the moment, completely oblivious to the consequences of her actions. And that was just a comedy show (again, painful; I turned it off at three minutes, and hopefully she didn't hate herself too much after the fact for being that fucking dumb (probably didn't)).  I honestly don't know where I'm going with this. I appreciate the link though. I hope you know (I'm sure you do), that I was just being flippant. But so I did want to give you an honest response in light of that and your earnest reply. Obviously every idiot (and actually most idiots) that voted for Trump is not a college kid and every college kid is not an idiot Trump voter. But it is very telling to note how little decisiveness you hear from the woman after she first wades in there, and how similar that sort of attitude is to your ""ask on the street"" people. Not going to blame all our problems on ""the youth."" Plenty of blame to go around.

">Say want you want about the tenets of National Socialism but at least it's a fucking ethos.  Uhh, I think you're overestimating the Nazis/giving them too much credit. They weren't deeply committed to principles, at least not moreso than the current US administration.  The genocide of Jews (among others) was not borne ***simply*** from Hitler & Co.'s deep and abiding anti-Semitism (though it should go without saying that it's not something anyone considers without first being vehemently anti-Semitic); it was at least as much a matter of practicality, something turned to when incentivised emigration (though ""incentivised"" is really a euphemism for active harassment, both legal and extralegal), active deportation, and detainment in concentration camps ceased to be viable means of handling their Jewish population. That is, as it happens, the reason why genocide was termed ""the Final Solution to the Jewish Question"" -- yes, killing someone has finality to it, but it's also ""the final solution"" because other solutions haven't worked.  >It's because they aren't Nazis, they're just greedy fucking nihilists.  They're definitely not nihilists.  If Trump and his cohort truly were nihilists, and cared only about money or power or clout or any other such thing divorced from principles, they wouldn't be so consistent in pushing one particular agenda, especially when that agenda gets as much flack and friction as it does.  To put it another way, they aren't using immigrants as a means to invoke emergency powers, they're using emergency powers as a means to attack immigrants.

All the protests you mentioned are evidence that huge parts of US society were willing to rise up and demand change. Similar things apply to lgbtq rights.

And even 30 years after those riots, and the change they brought to the US, German police in Munich was still maintaining a database of known homosexuals.

"Oh most definitely. 1933 Germany didn't have 1933 Germany as a point of reference. People can draw those similarities all day, and make poignant arguments to that end. And make no mistake, these are very *troubling* times. I can unfortunately already appreciate that on a visceral level that many cannot. But this is nearly a century later and the paradigm isn't even remotely the same. There was no Internet. There was no ""global economy"" on the scale we have now. Germany is physically the size of Montana. And our Hitler has dementia and a party full of suckerfish and opportunists with no bottom. It's mercenaries all the way down. There are very few ""true believers"" in those positions of power, even now, in this second term. He's already firing ""the help.""  I do think it's telling, things like Marco Rubio working four jobs (student loans are a bitch), things like the strategic dissents we're seeing with the SCOTUS, things like corporations testing the waters of measured opposition (see stories about Amazon, Walmart and Microsoft over the last few week). We don't live in a cowed country, like post-Versailles Germany. There are parallels for sure. I've said for a decade how the ""loss of national pride"" post-2008 that led to Trump's first regime was a direct analog to the loss of national pride that was a direct line to Hitler's rise (that's a research paper in itself, so I'm not going to go there, but maybe in another post, some day? :P) But there's still a whole lotta fucking fight left in us yet, have no doubt.  History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme, and all. We definitely need to all be aware of how dangerous this shit is. It's... it's fucking dangerous. That PO(tu)S is throwing a birthday party with tanks. But we also have some... weird advantages. A media ecosystem that is manipulatable and dispersed. A fiercely ""fuck the government"" attitude that is really at the very heart of this country's values (Trump voters, us voters, we're all closet populists).
