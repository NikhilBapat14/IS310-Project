Alternatively he just might be a grifter and a liar,crimzonphox,2025-05-09T12:41:08,51
"""Yes, it’s very strange. Doesn’t make any sense. I was promised that if I supported RFK Jr. in his Senate confirmation that neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an appointment (and that people much more qualified would be). I don’t know if RFK very clearly lied to me, or what is going on""  This, plus the fact she ever campaigned with him to begin with, makes me think she is just very, very dumb.   At a certain point some people need to start accepting they got conned.",thedybbuk,2025-05-09T12:46:42,22

I have a feeling this brainworm might be speaking Russian,Melstead,2025-05-09T19:04:46,1
I found all these old episodes of The Alex Jones show where RFK was a guest. Alex Jones calls him a great friend. That tells you all you need to know about RFK. He’s a grifter and liar just like the rest of them. ,Time-Situation8,2025-05-09T13:10:07,25

"The Podcast ""knowledge fight"" is pretty good if you hate Alex Jones but want to get a sampling of the insanity.   https://knowledgefight.libsyn.com/size/25/?search=Rfk  Episodes #798: April 19 and #830: July 16 2023 are the oldest mentions of RFK Jr they've covered, at least what the search could find",O918,2025-05-09T20:39:25,2
