"Politics is a battle over philosophical views, there are no objective answers to philosophical questions.  There multiple ways to solve any problem, politics is about fighting over which one of these people prefer based on their underlying philosophy. There's even the philosophical battle over whether government has the scope or authority to touch any given problem.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-09-18T09:16:53,29
"Because it's a really really complicated and chaotic system.  It's far more complex than things like physics; and it's far harder to conduct tests and get verifiable and consistent results in.  Many things are more trends than absolutes in the social sciences, and it's quite a lot harder to detect and prove such.  The world is constantly changing, especially these days with the advance of technology.  It's also the case that there's often a lot of vested interests that oppose some facts, or that biases known to exist in people affect the degree to which both individuals, and groups (through complex social dynamics), are willing to accept/agree with certain conclusions.",zlefin_actual,2024-09-18T11:26:21,18
"Many issues do have objective solutions, some that go back centuries. That's not the issue. The issue is how to implement those simple solutions while balancing social priorities - priorities which change.  The other end of it is that people are not a constant observable phenomenon like we have with natural science. If you drop a ball, every single time it will respond the exact same way to the world around it. Humans do not do this which is why social science isn't really 'solvable'. We constantly have to research where people are at",4ku2,2024-09-18T11:18:29,11
"Politics is a 3 (actually many more) body problem. Taxes and economic policies, to use your example, are not in the slightest “solved problems”, there are approximately 8 billion variables that interact in completely unpredictable ways with policies depending which also vary over time as random factors like weather and health, just as two examples, affect their behavior.",bgplsa,2024-09-18T12:04:07,3

"Politics is about power. Who has it and how they want to use it.  That's why political parties will change their policies based on how a populace is feeling.  It's not something where the goal is to solve problems until no problems exist.  Why do you HAVE to participate in this as a citizen? Well, these people are always looking for the things people care about so they can get elected. At least in democratic systems. If you don't show up, they don't have to worry about your issues. Or worse, they will make decisions at your expense because there's no blowback. If you show up, some of them will make an earnest attempt at solving your problems because it means you'll keep them in power.  Ever wonder why these geriatrics don't want to retire from politics while for EVERY other job know to mankind, people CANT WAIT to retire? It's not because these politicians are so passionate about solving your problems and they're so selfless that they can't take time in their twilight years to breathe in life and find other meaning before they go poof.  They stay in until the late 80s because power is addictive, it's intoxicating. They are at the apex of society.",naughtyobama,2024-09-18T12:18:56,2
"This is a pretty good question, but not for the reason you think it is. The first thing to note is that you're defining political science wrong. Poli sci is not the study of addressing current policy questions and their solutions. The mean reason poli sci hasn't accomplished this is because it's not at all trying to.  Actual modern poli sci is actually much closer to a solved science than you realize. Actual modern poli sci is about studying the concepts and structures of governing, not about answering policy questions directly. To that end, we actually have created some pretty solid known tendencies. For example, we know that certain political systems work better than others. We know that presidential systems tend to have more issues with friction and ineffectiveness than parliamentary systems. In this sense, it's ""solved"" that a parliamentary system is generally a better choice than a presidential system. The only wrench in this concept is that we ALSO know based on the concept of legitimacy that the political system that society broadly accepts the most is the best one for that particular electorate, so in a case like the US, a parliamentary system may not actually be better only because the electorate has different priorities.  These are much closer to modern poli sci discussions than the kinds of things you're suggesting.  But, even if we did focus on policy questions, actually a lot of it IS more settled than folks realize. For example, at this point there really isn't a question among academics and researchers if gun control works, or more specifically, if we can address the mass shooting problem in America by making guns less prevalent in society. The answer is an unequivocal YES, that would solve the problem. Similarly, we know Reaganomics doesn't work at this point. We've got plenty of evidence showing it doesn't. It's not really all that complicated.  So why aren't we able to just do the smart thing? Because the whole point of the political system is that we intentionally aren't asking just the smart people who know stuff what to do, but we're asking the whole segment of society. Asking just the smart people who know stuff is the basic premise behind monarchy--put the power in the hands of those most equipped to make good policy because of superior education/resources/knowledge/etc. Democracy is an intentional choice to crowdsource all our answers to policy questions, and that means sometimes we have to deal with pretty nonsense ideas.  As a compensation, we actually do try and educate our electorate quite a bit. We regularly fact check. We send kids to school to teach them science, math, economics, and more. Part of the problem is that if a kid went to school in 1974 then they *desperately* need a furthering education course in many topics, but we don't require that, and a person is a voter for the rest of their life. And we DO have folks in our political consciousness trying to push towards a more data-based understanding. That's what a lot of PACs do. There are half a dozen gun advocacy orgs where that's literally all they do. But the problem is people don't like to listen to lectures and data on complex social questions very much, so that effort often doesn't have very productive outcomes.",mormagils,2024-09-18T14:00:41,2

"I've seen a lot of good answers to this question. But what I'd say is largely that most things that are easy to solve have already been solved. 95% of people would agree we should probably have fire departments or public roads. The disagreement on things like that is largely how we pay for it or the way it is accomplished.  Things like taxes or other economic policies might have different effects at different times and it can't be brought down to an exact science. This all isn't helped by the fact that nobody understands economics, pretty much at all.  Social issues are largely ideological.  We are humans and have imperfect minds. We aren't truth seeking machines, most people operate on how they feel and operate operate in that manner. And we live in a democracy (at least in the US), and sometimes the voting populous has awful ideas about how things should work, which is reflected in our politicians.",Shinlin09,2024-09-18T21:16:40,2
"I think it’s because politicians campaign on what they can do for you in the next 2(house), 4 (White House), or 6 (senate) years.  Our problems cannot be solved in those time frames. One example is entitlement spending. We have a huge problem with the national debt. We need to find a way to spend less. A couple obvious ways to work on that are means testing to receive social security, and raising the age (again) at which you automatically qualify for social security. Those are  not winning things to run on. In general, we need to increase taxes and decrease spending (also policies which won’t get you elected). Politicians like to talk about making the rich pay their fair share, but the fact is that the rich already pay the majority of taxes and if you squeeze them more, you are squeezing job creators. I believe this is why political science isn’t “settled”.",Hazel1928,2024-09-19T07:12:24,2

"It has less to do with political science and more to do with the two major parties' ideas on what the country should look like. For republicans ideally the US would look like Hungary, Greece, or possibly WW2 Germany. For Democrats the US would look like Canada, Japan, Sweden or one of the other First World nations. There's a huge gulf between the two ideas. Republicans want to hurt as many people as possible to consolidate power for the top. Democrats want to help as many people and hopefully get rid of the top. We want everyone to have equal access, they do not.   But there's also some value to two parties so if one party goes too far, the other can pull it back.",GTRacer1972,2024-10-24T20:18:44,2
"I'm with you. I was so deeply frustrated by this that I made a free tool ( [https://voteinformer.org](https://voteinformer.org) ) that tries to at least help people understand that they even should care about policies in the first place. We don't even have that yet. People are arguing over personalities and vibes and rarely even get exposure to policy.

"You are assuming that science has an answer to these political questions. In rare cases this is true (e.g. trickle down economics is BS) but for the most part the data is too complicated to make a definitive answer.    Take the three body problem as an example. One might assume it is trivially easy to predict, yet it remains elusive.    Politics/economics/etc has thousands of variables, many of which have long time factors. It's not a system that can be easily predicted. Especially since we only get 2-4 years of data, much of which is clouded by changing administrative climates.   ",JRM34,2024-09-19T20:28:40,1
"Science does not mean objective or easily able to find a truth value. Your comments suggest you’re trolling against social sciences, so let me head that off.  First off, the question should be “what does political science want to study”. You are arguing for this position:  >the data shows time and time again…  i.e. There is a clear answer.   538 has a page where you can prove, to a statistically significant level, that Democrats improve the economy. Now switch that party for Republicans in that sentence and read it again, because that’s also true. Yes, I can show that both parties improve the economy and stand on stage and not lie to you. How?  Because there are issues of how we choose to define every term. How do you want to define economy? How do you want to define [political parties]?   More generally, you are assuming people are rational beings. Demand goes up, price goes up, demand goes down, price goes down. But people aren’t rational beings. We drive drunk.  We crash into public utilities. We pay off politicians and bribe them with good jobs when they leave. I buy my milk from one store and one store only, regardless of how expensive they make their price. Businesses discriminate even when they need work. Companies should fail but we bail them out.   People can’t be modeled. Not well, at least. Sure, we can get there — but for every one aspect of you I account for, there are 99 other things I didn’t.   But that doesn’t make it not a science. It’s still a pursuit of knowledge. We still can test things and come to conclusions. But the social sciences are the hardest sciences because what we study is unpredictable, that refuses to follow rules. And if you give people the best choice they’ll still refuse to choose it.",MrLegilimens,2024-09-20T03:16:40,1
"The solutions that work economically and socially are not necessarily the ones that are popular. The solutions that are popular are not necessarily the ones that work economically and socially. Politics is in large part salesmanship. Good salesmen are usually not the greatest engineers. Companies that give the engineering jobs to the engineers and the sales jobs to the salesmen are successful. But politics is not currently organized that well. There are too many people who only want benefit for themselves and people like them, not group benefit, who are actively sabotaging the engineering and selling bad solutions to the masses.",amerovingian,2024-09-21T15:21:58,1

"Political science explains the nature of power and belief.  It does not provide specific policy prescriptions.  The US founders were Enlightenment thinkers: They believed that there actually were correct answers to policy questions and that the system should be engineered so that personal self-interest wouldn't prevent the cream from rising to the top.  As a result, the US has a two-party system instead of the desired no-party system, which is accompanied by a fair number of bad outcomes.  Instead of trying and failing to suppress the inclination to form political parties, they would have been wiser to accept that parties would form and encourage enough of them that they would serve as checks and balances against each other.  The founders got it wrong.",I405CA,2024-10-04T22:48:02,1
"There are people with power who refuse to relinquish it and have built entire societies and law structures on retaining that power. Capitalism itself is built entirely on the benefit of a few and the exploitation of many.  Politics would settle itself if everyones needs are met, and we CAN meet everyones needs, but powerful people know this and purposefully keep people poor or hungry or wanting and use that to keep them fighting each other so no one can agree on anything.

"Because politic is a system invented by ancient greeks to articulate the power system they invented called democracy. Since then (3000 years ago) democracy was never used again. But since the greeks were one of the most intelligent humans in history companies have started using their terms for marketing. So thats how usa france etc use the words politic or democracy. We don’t have either of those, in fact no human in recorded history took part in politics or democracy of any form since 3000 years ago when the greeks fell to the romans.

"Right, but philosophy is about asking why.  Science is about asking how.  I'm not trying to get into the why.  Why can vary from person to person or day by day depending on what is desired.  My confusion is over why the ""hows"" are not already well established.    And yes, I understand there are multiple ways to solve most problems.  Even in my example, PV=nRT, I can reduce P by increasing V or decreasing T.  But I mean arguing over manipulating the same variable in different directions to achieve the same goal, e.g., raising or lowering taxes to stimulate the economy.  I can't reduce V to reduce P without also manipulating additional variables, and even though it is *possible* it's absolutely not more efficient and the final result is not *because* I am reducing V.  > There multiple ways to solve any problem, politics is about fighting over which one of these people prefer based on their underlying philosophy.  If I take this statement and apply it to engineering, for example, I can see what you are describing.  I can typically solve a problem cheaply, effectively, environmentally friendly, or quickly, etc.  So I guess that makes it a bit more clear.  However, any of those options are/have already well defined potential solutions with the detailed cost/benefits analysis already done or easily adapted to my specific project, and this would be required before any decision was made.  Though this cost/benefits style analysis may be available for political plans for the general public to view, I've admittedly never seen it (but I would assume it would be hundreds of pages long that the average person wouldn't have time to read, let alone fully understand).  I guess I can pretty well see what you are saying.  But it also reinforces my feeling that we need better basic political education.

All in all, it seems like like a vast chunk of the population is getting worked into an uproar over things we don't understand and realistically have no immutable solution, even if things improve (or deteriorate) we can't necessarily attribute it entirely to one thing or another to say ""this works"" or ""this doesn't work"", and the entities controlling and planning things really have no interest in us understanding.

"At high levels of both philosophy and mathematics, students are taught how to construct new branches of philosophy and mathematics respectively. In both cases you start with axioms that will always be true no matter what in your system, and work outwards from there to find what these axioms would result in if they are true.  If freedom is the greatest virtue you end up an old school Libertarian or an Anarchist. If pleasure is the greatest virtue you end up a Hedonist or a Utilitarian.  Each philosophy has multiple assumptions made as they work out from the starting axioms and that's why you end up with so many conflicts as people argue over not just which axioms are valid, but also which assumptions are correct.",Sol1496,2024-09-20T23:10:39,6

"It's easy to wave if off as vague interests  opposing an obvious practical solution, but I'd like to use a simple example of where the difficulties lie, if you'll let me be a bit cutesy. I'll tl;dr at the end if you dont want to listen to the spiel.  Look at a telephone pole.  Your typical pole is owned by either the electric or telephone company, and other companies pay rent to put their wires on that pole as needed. And that pole exists in a right of way set up by the town during development  for this purpose and for others like sidewalks and parking, You set that up during new construction, all simple enough, and time passes, arrangement worked.  Now a cable company comes in and wants to put wires on the pole to offer service. Everyone here agrees thats fine, desireable even, but one problem: the poles arent tall enough for all the wires so a taller one is needed. And that means someone has to place a new pole, place the wires of the various companies in  Who is paying for that? The electric company doesnt think it needs a new pole yet, so it doesnt feel like its getting benefit from the new pole, so the cable company should pay for it it all! But the cable company doesnt feel it should pay for it all, the project everyone wants isnt viable if they have to pay for the new poles alone and its not like theyre going to be the only one using the poles, so the cost should be shared a bit according to them. Which fine, but then how much? And what about the other companies on the pole who will have to move their stuff too, what are they getting paid to compensate for their wires getting moved around and service potentially disrupted? And what if the pole is taller and ruins a view from a property ages ago, or makes it harder to look around an intersection safely? No company involved is responsible for those things directly, but their actions are going to impact the lives of other who had no responsibility for this pole either.  You can try to work around this problem, but you'll always find new ones. Wanna try to fit the wires on the same pole? Cool, you created a less safe space for the workers, they arent gonna be happy? Wanna just bury it all? Cool, now you're working around the water company and disrupting the commute of everyone using the road. In each case, in order  to achieve what you want, the new cable company, you are going to be putting at least some burden on people who arent involved and who make perfectly rational choices before the situation changed and place then in a new situation they are burdened through no fault of their own.  And this is a solvable problem! The solution is ultimately assigning rights to each party and requiring they be paid compensation if those rights are infringed, that's an economic principle known as the Coase theory. But that theory doesnt care who the rights are assigned to, only that they are assigned to someone and everyone else has to deal with that. So in our example assigning all rights to the power company and requiring anyone else pay the power company to either do or not do something is an efficient outcome. But that also means anyone not assigned the right either has to suffer the burden of the electric company's choice or pay for it. So while efficient, i dont believe we'd call it desireable. So instead we try to balance out assigned rights and responsibilities and compensation to maximize our desired goals, whatever they are, minimize the losses and provide compensation for the losses. But each time that requires us to decided who gets the benefits of something, and who has to settle for just not being worse off. And that is solvable, we can use principles and methods to solve it each time, it is never solved.  tl;dr: politics is largely a question of assigning rights and responsibilities. An initial assignment can be perfectly rational and efficient, but as time goes on and circumstances changes it what is efficient but can leave the former, perfectly rational owners, at a loss. So you either have to compensate them or override them. And once you have more owners of more different rights, which you inevitably will, assigning more rights and compensation becomes as much art as science where the formula can guide but it cant just plug in. And thats before we even start talking about uncertainities.",Jakius,2024-09-18T14:07:10,3
