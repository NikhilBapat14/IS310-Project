Casey DeSantis = the Brett Favre of Florida Medicaid funds embezzlement,rapidcreek409,2025-04-27T10:48:59,231
"Well, they’re republicans, and now there’s a scandal, so now they’re guaranteed to stay in power. They’ll gain popularity, and republicans will just default to whataboutism, charities are actually bad for the people they help, the republicans investigating them are rinos and traitors to America, this is Christian persecution, blah blah blah.",FartVirtuoso,2025-04-27T11:29:01,45
And there will be no consequences. They elected Rick Scott to the senate and he stole like a **billion** dollars.,Area51_Spurs,2025-04-27T11:45:44,104

"“Lawmakers spent the spring investigating why $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement was routed to a charity connected to Hope Florida, which then transferred the same amount to two groups that financially backed a DeSantis-led campaign against legalizing recreational marijuana.   Key lawmakers have publicly suggested the flow of money appears illegal.”  “Remarkably, the investigation into Hope Florida was not by Democrats, but by Republicans — a striking sign of DeSantis’ eroding clout in a state capital he once controlled with unchallenged authority.”",ray_area,2025-04-27T14:23:06,11

What’s crazy is you’re hearing and seeing almost NONE of this on Florida. Being suppressed hard,the_sylince,2025-04-27T12:40:50,7
"News of this scandal broke one day after DeSantis hinted he would veto a bill that would ultimately sell off Gulfstream Park racecourse. Florida House Republicans are widely believed to have been bribed to support that bill by the track’s owner, who wants to cash out. I suspect a connection between the two events.",Open_Buy2303,2025-04-27T15:15:52,6

"I can't believe *that* is the scandal.   I'm not even a florida policy wonk, but off the top of my head:  - DeSantis deregulate insurance two years ago, and now home values are plummeting and residents are losing huge portions of their wealth  - Made it a felony for teachers to have books about black people, including black sports figures  - When teachers quit or left rather than take on criminal liability, DeSantis slashed teaching requirements, so now people with no education can be teachers  - a bunch of anti-immigrant headlines from a few years back that ruined all those construction businesses and drove up the cost of new homes",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-27T19:29:19,6
