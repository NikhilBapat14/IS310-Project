"Last week, after execs from Home Depot, Target, and Walmart personally told Trump shelves would be empty in three weeks, the administration’s stance softened in the trade war, promising Chinese tariffs would be lowered due to their unsustainability.  Now, it appears the trade war is only just passing its opening salvo as the administration is threatening escalation via embargo and China is having none of the bully bullshit.   Prepare for empty shelves.",Myrtle_Nut,2025-04-28T22:46:11,74

"""How much money do you think China would pay, to make the United States just go away""  Literally handed the world market to China on a silver platter.  The United States spent 40 years funding terrorism to get poorer countries in line, specializing their economy on specific exports, to cater specifically to our markets   Now we're putting tarrifs in place because they can't afford to buy our shit with all the money we give them for... :checks notes:..

"Trump is going to be *screwed* on this one, because when he inevitably backpedals, it will still take 30 days to send a container ship across the Pacific (45 to Houston, 55 to NYC).   And that's not counting ""firing production back up"" and ""transporting the items to the outbound port"" and ""haggling between suppliers and American purchasers"" and ""this world-historical own goal is pretty hilarious to China, so I wouldn't assume anyone there will be particularly inclined to do any of this with max efficiency.""  So if he caves a couple of weeks after containers stop arriving to LA, that's *six weeks minimum* of nothing coming in from China to the port of Los Angeles.",gringledoom,2025-04-29T01:08:00,30

Trumps huge issue on this matter is he cant stand that someone stands up to him since his image will crack.

"I'll bite; the only proof that article offered that China is in turmoil is that they're lying about talking with Trump about negotiations.  But it could just as easily be Trump lying to save face, so this boils down to ""he said, Xi said'  It also says that China is exempting certain products from the tariffs, but that's also what we're doing with cell phones and a few other items.   And the last claim is that China is tearing down its relationships, but we've also heard that they are forming new trade alliances with countries that they never would have done so in the past.   Please note that there is a parallel in each of those 3 statements to what we're doing.  Maybe you should question why our playbook is now the same as China's.",drwhoovian,2025-04-28T23:13:05,18
