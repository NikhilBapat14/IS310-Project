">Empirical work exists showing that ***most people support a party because they believe it contains people similar to them***, **not because they have gauged that its policy positions are closest to their own.** Specifying what features of one’s identity determine voter preferences will become an increasingly important topic in political science.  >[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5120865/pdf/nihms819492.pdf](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5120865/pdf/nihms819492.pdf)  Party affiliation is more a matter of club membership than it is about policy.  Most people choose the party that appears to have ""people like me.""  To break Trump's support, efforts need to made so that the club members want to turn on Trump, on their terms.  They need to stop seeing him as being people like me.  Many Trump voters see him as a patriotic and tough winner.  They need to come to see him as an unpatriotic and weak loser, *as they define it*.  Democrats tend to focus on what they perceive to be his meanness.  But many of his fans see that as a positive quality or they perceive it as a show of strength, so that approach ultimately backfires.  Trump opponents need to attack him with terms such as ""incompetent"", ""weak"" and ""failed"".  They need to mock him for being a screwup rather than making him appear to be tough by fearing him.  The threat to democracy argument does not move marginally attached Democrats.  Devoted Trump supporters believe that there is a threat to democracy, but that it's the Democrats who pose the threat.  So that angle needs to be punted post haste.",I405CA,2025-04-04T18:22:17,913

"Thanks to the massive, hate-fueled right-wing media echo chamber, there's literally nothing trump can do to lose his base. He could punt a bald eagle off the Capitol steps during the national anthem and they'd still call it “alpha energy.”  It’s a cult, not a political movement. Loyalty isn’t earned—it’s programmed. Facts don’t matter. Hypocrisy doesn’t register. And right-wing media is the IV drip keeping that delusion alive.  Just look at today: Fox News literally removed the DOW ticker from their live broadcast after the market tanked in response to trump’s tariffs. Barely a whisper about it. If the same thing had happened under Biden, they’d have breaking news banners, sirens, and three “experts” foaming at the mouth within seconds.  The goal isn’t news—it’s narrative. And as long as that machine keeps running, there’s no low trump can hit that his base won’t cheer for.

"It depends on the republican. There’s a big difference between someone who “held their nose” and voted for him and someone who has fully bought into his bullshit and essentially worships him. The former is probably able to be convinced, the latter is very likely not.  From a more practical standpoint, the focus on flipping Republican voters in order to beat Republicans has proven disastrous to Democrats over and over. The way for them to win is to actually cater to their base and drive turnout.   For a decade now the Democratic Party has tried to move farther to the right in order to “sway centrists and moderate republicans.” The issue with that is that it both alienated their own base, and doesn’t offer many incentives for a Republican to vote for them. Why would they vote for the budget, almost-Republicans when they could just vote for the Republicans? That ends up with them losing lots of turnout amongst their younger or more radical base, and only winning over a tiny fraction of moderate Republicans.",ProfessorSputin,2025-04-05T01:07:56,3

There is no off-ramp anymore until he dies. And even then, the damage is done. They have successfully undermined the foundation of the country, and we're never going back imo. They effectively own the minds of their voters, and they're just slowly going to peel more and more moderates and independents as time goes on. Propaganda is powerful, they don't need a majority of people to support them, and they've proven to be surprisingly adept at manipulating people to vote against their own self interest.

"For a % of Republicans, 38 sounds about right, absolutely nothing will ever cause them to abandon Trump as he is emblematic of their fascistic impulses. I don’t think the Dems should bother trying to change them as it is a waste of resources. They need to work on the swing voters, younger voters, and people within their own party.   The Dems have a lot of work to do and I doubt they have the stones to do it. They need to stop pretending like everything is going to go back to some earlier status quo once (and if) Trump is gone. They need to substantially unify their messaging. They need to learn how to attack. They need to find young white male leaders who have bigger dicks than AOC, Duckworth, and Porter because as smart as Booker and Schiff are they are not nearly brutal enough when they attacks.   And finally they need to develop plans to both destroy Trump and the Republican Party and execute them. Not impeach, not damage, destroy.   Trump can be driven over the edge where he has a mental health crisis or his mental health can cause a catastrophic physical issue. Go to the base issues with him and just beat that drum until he blows up. This absolutely can be successful given his narcissism, age, and health.

The way for them to win is to actually cater to their base and drive turnout.   For a decade now the Democratic Party has tried to move farther to the right in order to “sway centrists and moderate republicans.” The issue with that is that it both alienated their own base, and doesn’t offer many incentives for a Republican to vote for them.

The failures in Iraq and Afghanistan were blamed entirely on Bush, and he took some blame for the 2007-2009 recession as well.   Trump is on his way to a recession which is unambiguously caused by his actions, though it's still too early to know what will happen with any certainty.

"Tariffs, if they stay at current levels.      I heard an estimate that it will take around six weeks for the price increases from tariffs to really start affecting consumer prices in a major way.  The currencies of export-driven economies may fall, and importers and retailers will absorb some of the cost, but these tariffs will cause significant inflation and a recession, possibly a severe one. Worst case, it will cause *stagflation*. Inflation is usually the result of an overheating economy. Inflation paired with a slowing economy (stagnation) is especially hard to manage.  The inflation seen under the last administration wasn't Biden's fault, for the vast majority of the rise. The coming inflation and recession will be 100% Trump's fault. The MAGA core will shrink to 10% or less of the electorate, and Trump's popularity will fall to levels not seen in modern times.  The non-crazy wing of the Republican party can see what is about to happen, and they may be able to convince Trump to change course. I was certain that Trump was primarily using tariffs as a negotiating ploy and that we would wind up with a few more targeted tariffs and maybe an across-the-board increase of 5-10%. This could still happen, but I'm far less sure after ""Liberation Day"".  If Trump changes course, he can limit the damage, avoid a recession and retain his MAGA base.

"“You see, at first when someone says, let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports, it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while, it works, but only for a short time.  “What eventually occurs is first homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs.  “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fears of trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens; markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.  “The memory of all this occurring back in the 30s made me determined, when I came to Washington, to spare the American people the protectionist legislation that destroys prosperity. Now, it hasn’t always been easy; there are those in Congress, just as there were back in the 30s, who want to go for the quick political advantage – who risk America’s prosperity – for the sake of short term appeal to some special interest groups who forget that more than five million American jobs are directly tied to the foreign export business, and additional millions are tied to imports.  “But those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused, is deep and searing. And today, many economic analysts and historians argue that high tariff legislation passed back in that period, called the Smoot-Hawley tariff, greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery.” US President Ronald Reagan, April 25, 1987  https://youtube.com/shorts/Mj6N-WBPrVw?si=ziOvXKSKyDXXDh_-",sweaty-pajamas,2025-04-05T21:11:31,1

"> It’s wild to me that the man is the polar opposite of everything I was told a conservative was growing up.  When you were growing up, conservatives were probably ~40% white people with college degrees (generally for the tax breaks, I'm referring to the old business wing of the Republican party).  That group went pretty hard Dem over the past 10-20 years. Are you legitimately surprised that the people that white people with college degrees like aren't represented anymore?  Only the people who vote for and support a party get to chose its politicians. Out of all of the people asking ""what ever happened to Republicans like Mitt Romney?"" on this forum, what percentage do you think would actually vote for Mitt Romney?  > Thus I’m led to believe conservatives have no actual base values they won’t change if they can “win”.  No political party actually has values. They're organizations. Organizations don't have values, the people inside the organizations have values (sometimes). When those people leave, that organization doesn't have those values anymore.  I know the concept of ""groups"" is useful because the human brain has trouble conceptualizing numbers bigger than 17, but it seems to leave you confused here, so it's probably best to do away with that abstraction when thinking about this. The most likely explanation is that the composition of the group itself is different than you think, possibly because you're starting to get old and haven't updated your stereotype of what this group is (happens to all of us at some point).",Sarmq,2025-04-05T12:29:59,1

"Tbh, I think if this was going to work, it would have already. It certainly does raise the spirits of Democrats, so I’m not discounting that, but I think so many people have been doing this, even if the mainstream media isn’t, that I’m just not sure it really matters to his supporters if other people are calling them losers. They expect it, and honestly, they revel in it. They have a persecution complex. They want to believe they are the outsiders with no power, because it fuels their self righteousness.   The thing that Democrats should do, that would be a lot more behind-the-scenes work, is actually start trying to undermine the strength of the Republican media and propaganda machine. I think the best way to do that is to create Republican infighting. Get them to create conspiracies about each other. Get them to doubt and mistrust each other. If you can do that, you severely limit the potency of right wing media, because they won’t all know exactly what they should be messaging. Look at the whole thing over H1B and honestly, I get the same vibes from tariffs.

It's about delivering bad results and fumbling the ball.  It is *incompetence* that needs to be at the heart of the anti-GOP message.  Republicans are widely perceived as being more competent and capable with business, the economy and national security.

"I think you're mostly right about Trump's influence holding the party together, yeah. Bur what I mean is, even if Trump goes, the GOP won't see a return to the pre-Trump years. Romney and Bush style conservatism is out the window, and they're only paying Reaganism lip service.  The 2012 autopsy said the party should be more welcoming to minorities. They've done absolutely nothing on that front, and Trump's gains with Latino and Black voters was due more to Trump's personality and the unpopularity of Biden's policies than a result of GOP minority outreach. This is just one example, but with how nativist the GOP has become, there's no going back from that, at least in the near future. Also, I won't pretend that the GOP isn't beholden to corporate interests, but it's much more willing to bully business into living through rough patches than dancing to Wall Street's tune like in the old days.  Point is, yes, Trump is holding people like Cruz, Rand, Vance, etc. together, and you might see a split when he goes. So you'll have e.g. Trumpism with a more libertarian flair, Christian Nationalism, isolationism, you name it. Most of this is basically antithetical to the pre-Trump GOP, but it doesn't matter because the base has made it clear that they want this stuff rather than what they viewed as the milquetoast GOP they had before.

"We are talking about messaging. You accomplish zero percent of your goals in Congress if you can't get elected. And inclusiveness should be inclusive. If you think calling entire groups of voters ""deplorable"" is inclusive you're wrong.  Perhaps I see this more clearly because I'm a Latino who married a redhead and had kids who appear kinda white. We live in the old Latino area of San Antonio and my kids had to sit in classrooms where teachers called them out for their whiteness. But their white mom grew up in the same neighborhood (Edison) and had no more privilege than the rest of us. I don't see the benefit of making one identity the Savior and the other identity the villain. I don't see the benefit of identity politics at all. That's very different than acknowledging the racist historical, and even current, policies of the United States. It's different than acknowledging the sexist and homophobic side of America as being wrong.  It's kind of like a white lady, having been bullied by a brown person, calling other brown people the enemy forever after that point. That's neither true nor productive. We can call for inclusiveness but it needs to actually be inclusive. We need to protect even the rich white men. And before you shoot me for saying that, consider being one of Trump's kids. Would you want to be denied any kind of assistance based on Trump's wealth? Would you want to have to kiss Trump's butt so he pays for your college? Why can't free college include the handful of kids of rich parents? Inclusive is 100% inclusive or it's exclusive. That's just one example but it's true.  And as far as calling men's rights to discuss abortion a straw man or telling us our opinions don't matter, please remember that we all had to be born from a woman. We, as men, don't lose our ability to appreciate birth just because we don't have the ability to give birth. For that matter infertile women shouldn't be excluded either, nor trans women. We are all part of the discussion because we are all part of the American Citizenry. I'll agree wholeheartedly that it's ridiculous to have a predominantly male group setting policy for women's reproductive rights. And I agree the current policies are horrific. But I'm an issue like that we need to bring as many votes to the ballot as possible and saying half the population doesn't matter doesn't bring out voters. That should be more obvious than I think it is to the DNC. We can't vilify groups and then get upset when they skip the vote or even jump ship to the other side that says they are part of the solution and can help America end the division. That isn't what the republican party is actually doing, but it's what they SAY they are going to do. That's why so many Trump voters say they feel lied to. They wanted desperately to believe one party truly welcomed them and cared about them. Unfortunately the Democratic party made it far too easy to make it seem as though the Democratic party didn't.  We need to clean up our messaging. We need to get back to putting universal policies front and center. And, once we are back in control, we need to follow through and actually legislate those into law. Pelosi had her chance in Obama's first two years to pass EVERYTHING, including codifying reproductive rights, cleaning up election contributions, etc. But she opted to meet the divisive topics on the table because it benefitted her too much to point to the bogeyman and win reelection.

No one is arguing that Americans are not to blame or don't bare the bulk of responsibility.  But Russia spending so obviously to install a manchurian candidate who openly shuns NATO and western values in general while cum dumpstering for authoritarians is unique to this regime.  The last time the Republican party supported authoritarianism and used the same ""America First"" slogan was in advocacy for Hitler before the US entered WW2.  Luckily we had FDR.  Not so lucky this time.",lovetoseeyourpssy,2025-04-04T19:06:10,3
