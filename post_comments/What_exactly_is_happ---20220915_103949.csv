"Calling it a “crisis” is just political.  The right wing sites  and the Republican Party are attempting to use the fear of Latinos to win votes.  Immigration is a serious issue that has varied problems. It needs serious thought and reasoned measures to improve it. There are no quick fixes to the problems, but the problems being claimed are not new and not unprecedented.",cincyblog,2022-09-17T09:44:45,4
"We need to focus a lot more on what to do at the border.  We have 200 million people in Central and South America that are going to be increasingly forced north by climate change.  No matter who is in charge, we need to understand what is coming, and try to find effective, safe, and humane policies and procedures.",vandeervecken,2022-09-16T22:06:11,1
"The problems aren’t new, but the volume of the influx *is* unprecedented. The closest we came to seeing numbers like this before was at the turn of the century. It hasn’t been anywhere near this bad in a long time",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-17T09:54:01,6
It is absolutely was crisis especially during peak covid,ammmukid,2022-09-24T10:47:40,1
Thanks for the insight but that doesn't answer my question. What is going on at the border *right now*?,Bubugacz,2022-09-16T23:43:59,2
"> We have 200 million people in Central and South America that are going to be increasingly forced north by climate change.  Rubbish.  First it was death squads targeting everyone; now it is climate change as the excuse for illegal immigration. No, they are not forced  to move north.  Central and South America are not like tiny Micronesian islands that will disappear completely due to sea level rise. Residents on those islands will *have to move.*  Most places in the world, including N. America, are increasingly impacted by climate  change. Everyone will have to adapt. Central and South America are vast regions -- they will have to find their solutions.",Markdd8,2022-09-19T04:51:49,1

"It’s bad. 7,000 illegal immigrants enter Texas *PER DAY*. It has gotten really bad under the current administration.   I’m all for immigration when it is done legally and the folks coming in are vetted, but what’s happening now is not ideal",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-16T23:59:53,0
"Ever-increasing numbers of refugees from climate change, narco-violence, and political unrest.  Systems are becoming completely overwhelmed and both sides talk about fixing it constantly, but neither ever does anything to actually fix it in any meaningful way.     Given that it is going to continue to grow and soon will star growing first geometrically, and then exponentially, dark times are very near at our southern border.",vandeervecken,2022-09-17T01:54:35,1
"Yes, good job. That was indeed the last turn of the century.",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-19T08:19:36,1
How does that compare to previous years? What's different about this now vs in the past? Who are the people coming?,Bubugacz,2022-09-17T00:25:27,3

"It’s a lot more. The average southern border apprehensions between 2016-2019 [were 497,498](https://www.statista.com/statistics/329256/alien-apprehensions-registered-by-the-us-border-patrol/) per year. In 2021, that number more than tripled to 1,662,167.   As of June 2022 CBP had recorded 1.74 million interactions, with the expectation that we will easily pass 2 million by the end of the year, crushing last year’s numbers, which already were the highest of all time.  And to your second question, the influx is mostly via Mexico, but there are people of many nationalities. These folks who got sent to Martha’s Vineyard on Wednesday were Venezuelans.",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-17T07:12:27,1
"Not to be pedantic but those numbers only prove apprehensions are up. Doesn’t speak to the actual number of people crossing the border physically. Does speak to more successful enforcement, which would mean the current admin is actually handling it better than years past.",dunpyklungo,2022-09-17T17:52:04,1

"No need to get defensive. Just pointing an important detail out. Professionally I used to handle budgets for an LE agency and there was always a distinction, when it came time for money to get doled out, between enforcement numbers Vice crime numbers. They aren’t the same.",dunpyklungo,2022-09-18T09:21:00,0
"I’m not getting defensive. I just think you’re getting pedantic to muddy the waters. Models based on apprehensions and interactions are the best metric we have for measuring the influx of undocumented people along the southern border. From that data analysis, predictions and estimates are made about total influx. If you don’t view this modeling as reliable how would you suggest we analyze those trends instead?  To your main point, that better enforcement could explain the massive variation in average annual apprehensions between 2021/2022 and the previous decade, I’ll point out that the number of CBP agents stationed at the southern border has remained steady over the past 6 years, averaging between 16,500 and 17,000. CBP and ICE funding has not seen a significant increase since 2018. If you can explain to me how a group with the same number of employees and same amount of funding was able to *quadruple* their efficacy I’d love to hear about it.",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-18T09:52:04,3
