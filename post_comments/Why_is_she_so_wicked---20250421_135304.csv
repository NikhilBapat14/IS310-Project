They follow JESUS and his teachings, not some prosperity gospel millionaire pastor or our CINO POTUS. Even I can recognize that some popes have been better than others. Francis was one of the better ones. I've expressed my condolences to my Catholic friends because I know the Pope is a father figure for them.

"It's an easy answer.  1,  she is Southern Protestant.  A denomination of followers that changed the 2nd commandment in their version of God's commandments to his people.  They also removed 7 books of the bible and changed a few words in the book of Romans to legitimize a false gospel and separate from GOD's true Church started by Christ himself.  Many of these denominations were infiltrated by the KKK in the early 1900's   2.  KKK has a revulsion to the Catholic Church.  All other denominations are welcome into their org. except for Catholics.  There is a reason.   3.  The Masonic Lodge is luciferin by nature and has mission to destroy the Catholic Church from the inside out.   4.  She is a hateful human being that loves bare false witness against her neighbor.   5.  She uses Christianity as a shield to defend her actions.  Therefore legitimizing all she does in the name of GOD or her version on him.   6.  This is a real pamphlet photographed in the USA.  Read who they are recruiting.  No Catholics are invited.  Calling all LIKE MINDED WHITE PROTESTANTS.  This is why MTG hates the Catholic Church IMHO.  https://preview.redd.it/8yedz8gi69we1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a365007a35043e8ed5c22004c099fd2a2b2f72e",Both-Leading3407,2025-04-21T16:12:50,3

"Hey for all the ""Christian persecution"" that they pump out repeatedly, this sure seriously persecutes some Christians.  Unlike false persecution, however, Catholics have been persecuted throughout history, so this is nothing new.  Being mocked or disrespected for being Catholic is just part of existing.  People have a real problem with a faith that has a visible leader like the Pope.  They question where people's trust really lies.  For anyone who doesn't know or cares to care, the Pope is the Holy Father of Catholocism whose position follows St. Peter in succession as the ""bishop of Rome.""  As you can imagine, after all of these years, there are disputes over even saying that, including who is the true successor at times, and that's just humanity.

"salvation is a free gift and not of works. the last thing i'm going to tell Jesus is ""look what i did!"" when i get to heaven to justify me being there. none of us deserve to be there at all, that's grace. i cannot support a gospel based completely off of works and rituals to get me to heaven, i am just trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross. that's my beef with the reformed Calvinistic churches with ""main character"" complexes, sinless perfectionism, church of Christ, roman Catholics... and anyone jumping in front of Christ to declare that you have to go through them to get to Jesus Christ.   oddly enough i see protestants in the trump cult declaring they are the one and only church more often than Catholics.  automatic red flag if they preach prosperity gospel, lordship salvation, or some sort of ritual to get me to heaven. my works are filthy rags and i come to Jesus with empty hands and asks him to save me.      ""Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; \*but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.\*  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful \*works\*?""  they trusted in their works and didn't do the will of the father. they didn't accept him as a savior and trusted in their own works and will be judged outside of Christ. then what is the will of the father?  ""And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.""",Single_Confidence472,2025-04-23T20:56:51,2

This is a fear that was bred into our species, and can be seen today in the ‘uncanny valley’ effect, in a lot of animation or animatronic.     Neanderthals would have been more than four times stronger then humans, and have been found with human remains in there camps, that look like they were eaten.   So they occasionally ate us.  When Neanderthals moved into a land occupied by humans, humans populations left.

I'll be honest but asides from some smaller denominations most large church entities including the catholics (some sects/orders excluded) are pretty far away from what you would expect a Jesus following Christian to present as. A lot of the big power players in the religion seem to fall victim to all the trappings of power. Francis is fairly unique in he definitely appeared more Christ like than his predecessors.  Greene is beholden to evangelicals but she also beholden to the Maga movement which has its now clearly has its roots in a fascistic view of the world. The one of the most iconic element that fascistic movement seems take is cruelty for cruelty sake; she becomes more important as a party loyalist for her vile cruelty not in spite of it. The Nazis had plenty of members who would never be in positions of power in a normal system because it was a system that the elevated the most cruel and vile among themselves it elevated the worst of humanity. Maga has a frighteningly similar trajectory the glee that movement and its party members take in cruelty is one of the most convincing arguments that it is following a similar path.,Timely_Tea6821,2025-04-21T15:21:08,7
