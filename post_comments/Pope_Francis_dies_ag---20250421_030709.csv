"**From The Telegraph:**   Pope Francis has died at the age of 88.  The Argentinian pontiff had been in hospital earlier this year where he was battling double pneumonia.  News of his death was announced by the Vatican in a video message.  Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires in 1936, he took the name Francis in honour of St Francis of Assisi, who led a humble life of service to the poor, and as a nod to St Francis Xavier, a founding member of the Jesuit Order in the 16th century.  In 2013, he was elected by cardinals to succeed [Pope Benedict XVI](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2022/12/31/pope-emeritus-benedictxvi-obituary/), who took the world by surprise when he announced that he was abruptly terminating his eight-year papacy.  Pope Francis was the first pope from the Americas, the first Jesuit pope and the first from the Western Hemisphere.     **Follow the latest updates on our live blog:** [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/04/21/pope-francis-death-latest-updates-catholic-church-vatican/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/04/21/pope-francis-death-latest-updates-catholic-church-vatican/)",TheTelegraph,2025-04-21T03:16:30,214
"Blessings to him, may he rest in peace. Once they said the 88 year old had pneumonia it wasn’t shocking that this would happen. He got one last Easter in this world, before moving on to the world that is to come",f1sh98,2025-04-21T06:02:56,106

"Speaking for myself who is not a Catholic nor a Christian, I found him to be one of the best Popes. He seemed like a genuinely good person, and he cared for the world.

"Fingers crossed its Erdo or Sarah. The lurch to the left that he pushed has caused many Catholics to leave the faith or at least become apathetic to the Church (I know of many, am borderline one of them).

"Sorry to hear about your grandma, and RIP Pope Francis.     There are people already making jokes and having tin-foil conspiracies about his death in r/agedlikemilk and other threads such as ""He died of cringe since JD Vance visited"" or ""This administration used their Russian arsenal to poison him,"" etc... People are really deranged and delusional. The Pope died at 88 years old after dealing with double pneumonia (which is a blessing in itself he overcame it at his age) and people are jumping to make memes/edgy comments already, disparage him because they didn't like how he led the church, or again... coming up with tin-foil-hat conspiracies to stir the pot.  I'm finding it few-and-far-between all the comments that are giving just a bit of honor and compassion to his passing and leaving a good wish... It's sad.",LordRattyWatty,2025-04-21T09:30:49,47

We are actually likely to see a more conservative pope elected.  My understanding is that it tends to go back and forth like that on purpose.,TermFearless,2025-04-21T09:55:19,5
"I think the pope dying on Easter (one night after Easter?) shows the pope is the antichrist. Christ rose on Easter. The antichrist died on Easter. Just shows the pope is a false Christ because he has the exact opposite fate of Christ on Easter.  I will be very surprised if a more conservative pope is selected. I think each new pope from now on will be more and more progressive and liberal. The whole point of a world religion is that it’s a false Christianity. It calls itself Christianity but has nothing in common with what the Bible says. Catholicism has always been like that, which is why the Protestant reformation happened. But I think it’s going to get worse. In order to become the true worldwide religion, Catholicism is going to have to abandon the few things that still agreed with the Bible in order to get the liberals and other religions on board. I have no idea how many more popes that will take, but I think that is where we are headed with each successive pope. Francis was just the start of the new ultra liberal direction.",crystalized17,2025-04-21T12:09:34,-6

"Strictly speaking, the Bible doesn't seem to have a lot of commentary on what's the best economic system to run a country. The most I can think of is Leviticus:  >22 ""And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up to its edge, nor shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am the Lord your God.""  Back then religious law and common law was the same, but I don't think it's unfair to say that charity is expected of good Chrisitians. And there are plenty of words by Jesus against the love of money, but that's not an indictment of capitalism in of itself, but a spiritual cautioning against idolizing material goods over God.",Yulong,2025-04-21T09:30:11,36

"It didn’t bring everything back at once. The splitting happens as people reread their Bible more and are more and more willing to get back to the religion Jesus actually practiced (which is not that far away from Judaism. Sunday is not and never will be Sabbath for example. “Immortality” of the soul is from paganism not the Bible. Death is a sleep. Hell is not eternal. The wages of sin is death, not eternal torment. Nobody is immortal until the resurrection of the saved. etc etc) Many churches still cling to many beliefs that are not based in the Bible, hence all of the splitting as some groups are willing to acknowledge some obvious truths but not others. Catholic Church is one of the worst because they’re more interested in “unity” than getting to the truth. Non-denominational aren’t anywhere as bad since they’re Protestant, but they too value “unity” over truth of scripture. If your unity is built on falsehoods, it’s not doing you any good. It leads to evil and corruption.  This is the heart of what will establish the last days’ world religion. People will insist “unity” is more important than truth.",crystalized17,2025-04-21T20:16:53,0

Amaz getting back to reading their Bible. And the New Testament wasn’t even written until several decades until after Christ’s resurrection.

"Ancient Rome legalizing Christianity (313 AD) and adopting it as the national religion is what brought all of the pagan beliefs into the church and altered it forever. Rome went from burning the early Christians at the stake, feeding them to lions, etc, to eventually ""if you can't beat them, join them and corrupt them from within!"" and brought a huge truckload of roman and greek paganism into the church. And after that, the church drifted further and further away from the Bible since nobody was allowed to correct the church, the church is ""perfect"" and beyond criticism, plus storing everything in latin so the common people couldn't even understand it themselves and point out the obvious mismatch between church teachings and the Bible.  Are you an atheist? If you don't like that the Bible wasn't immediately written down the next day after every single event, then why do you believe in the Bible at all? Or are you a Roman Pagan instead of an atheist?  Catholics are a very strange bunch. They don't study the Bible or other denominations at all (so they can feel there's nothing wrong with Catholicism) OR they openly admit that Church doctrine should always supersede the Bible and the only reason is because they ""feel"" that's the way to do it. Screw what the Bible says, as far as Catholics are concerned. Mormons are the same way with their unique book superseding the Bible.",crystalized17,2025-04-22T22:30:58,1
