">The Florida congresswoman said Sánchez, a home health aide, was complying with an ICE request for a regular check-in at a Tampa office when agents took her from her family and sent her to Cuba.  The whole idea of grabbing and deporting people who are attending their required check-ins is just cruel. If they're such dangerous criminals, why would they check in with ICE???",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T16:14:34,110
"From reporter Jennifer Bendery:  Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) said Monday that a mom in her Tampa district was “ripped away” from her infant by ICE agents and unlawfully deported to Cuba.  In a letter to President Donald Trump, Castor urges him to “immediately” grant humanitarian parole for Heidy Sánchez, whose husband told Castor that ICE agents’ separation of Sanchez from her infant daughter was so traumatic that the baby was taken to the hospital.

An overwhelming majority(80%+) of folks check-in and let the government know where they are and follow the process. All this is going to do is actually get folks to stop following it since it's a fucking setup now.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T16:55:36,66
