">""I just got off the phone with the president about Amazon's announcement — this is a hostile and political act by Amazon,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.  Telling customers how much of a product's price comes from government tariffs is ""a hostile and political act"", in the opinion of Trumps government.

Well a reporter had the question ready to go and the press secretary had a response ready to go (complete with a piece of paper and accusations about Jeff Bezos). It would be funny if the reporter was from \[Jeff's\] Washington Post.,30mil,2025-04-29T11:59:53,5

Daddy Trump will decide what you need to know about his policies and how they affect you. No need for you to worry your pretty little proletariat head about it.,BurnedWitch88,2025-04-29T12:37:53,2
"I find his psychology fascinating. Because it doesn't seem like he was so deeply needy and insecure earlier in his career. It's as if he's gotten emotionally weaker the more wealth/power he's accumulated. (Or, he's always been like this but he had a better handle on it before.)   That's not normally how the needle moves -- if it moves at all.",BurnedWitch88,2025-04-29T12:40:57,1

"Fair!  ""In February 2015, a 75th-anniversary version of Fanta was released in Germany. Packaged in glass bottles evoking the original design and with an authentic original wartime flavor including 30% whey and pomace, it is described on the packaging as ""less sweet"" and a German original. An associated television ad referenced the history of the drink and said the Coca-Cola company wanted to bring back ""the feeling of the Good Old Times"" which was interpreted by many to mean Nazi rule. The ad was subsequently replaced.""  :/",deltadal,2025-04-29T14:27:44,1
