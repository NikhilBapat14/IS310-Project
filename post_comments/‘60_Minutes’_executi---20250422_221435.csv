"MAGA really be doing exactly what they're accusing the Left of, except for realsies. ""Cancel culture"", state-run ideology, government abuse and overreach, you name it.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-22T22:18:27,46
"> In a memo obtained by CNN, Owens said to “60 Minutes” staff that the last few months have made it clear that he “would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it” or make “independent decisions based on what was right for 60 Minutes.”  >“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” Owens wrote, adding that “the show is too important to the country, it has to continue, just not with me as the Executive Producer.”",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T22:35:32,12
CBS caved and has bent the knee for Trump.  All their integrity is gone.,Troubled202,2025-04-22T23:09:51,5
"The moral injury this administration is causing legitimately intelligent, noble people is real. He believes in ethics, suspending bias and following rules, none of which aligns with trumps values. Good for him.",sunshinevibes16,2025-04-22T23:51:35,3

They do that so they can justify to their base why it’s ok when they do it.,One_Olive_8933,2025-04-23T07:59:18,2
I think this is called a hybrid regime where you have intensive censorship but you still have democratic elections?,Fritja,2025-04-22T22:56:21,4
CBS's viewership has to skew quite old. Older folks tend to be MAGAts. I can see how they got themselves into this mess.,TheyCallHimJimbo,2025-04-23T02:58:20,3
"""Free but not fair"" elections.  Elections are considered *free* if there is no directly illegal interference, such as ballot stuffing, voter intimidation, blanket disqualification of specific races or genders to vote, or similar.  Elections are considered *fair* if, in addition, there is no indirect interference which, while not (necessarily) illegal in its own right, combined to skew the playing field and give one side an advantage not related to their merits. Government propaganda, gerrymandering, electoral college inequalities, intentionally restrictive voter registration and hours, etc.  US elections, at least since the *Voting Rights Act of 1965*, are generally considered *free* (there have been accusations by both sides over the years of rigged voting machines, and of course Trump's ""fake 2020 election"" BS, but none have been corroborated by evidence.) However, the US never had a truly *fair* election system, and furthermore, the fairness has been steadily dropping for decades.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-23T06:07:00,1
