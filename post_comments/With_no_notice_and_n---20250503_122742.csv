"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.

"Partly it's unintentional. Washington politicians don't care -  and don't always bother to research - that their policies will hurt *their* constituents the most. The voters keep voting the way they do because there is a significant overlap in Republican voters and people who lack critical thinking skills. They don't connect their vote with the subsequent results.

This is the correct answer. People don't seem to understand that Trump is an avatar. White Americans always had the veneer of being above board.

They high-fived and talked about how they love supporting a president who raped a 13-year-old girl at Epstein's party as soon as the elevator doors closed.

yep. moved to tampa in 2017 from a midsized city in central IL and expected change as far as predominately conservative ideology was concerned and found out instead that it was even worse despite the size. felt like everyone i came into contact with who wasn't obviously upper-middle class was conservative. It was even worse in my few travels to the myth that is the floridian 'countryside.' i lived there for about a year and moved straight back to IL lol,Own-Review-2295,2025-05-03T18:38:10,6

"I understand what it actually means, but I've seen this headline repeated multiple times and everyone seems to misunderstand it the same way. Maybe a better headline exists?  >The district serves about 300 students in person in Henry and Randolph counties. However, it also serves nearly 9,000 online through a partnership with the Indiana Digital Learning School. ([source](https://www.wishtv.com/news/education/union-school-corporation-fight/))  I understand and agree with the need for public discussion, but I've seen a few discussions (including this thread here) where this point from TFA just hasn't come up:  >Only 12% of Indiana Digital Elementary students were proficient in English and Language Arts while about 17% of Digital Junior High students scored at or above proficiency, according to 2024 ILEARN scores. In math, scores for all INDLS students were well below proficiency.      About 6.4% of elementary students passed the state’s math assessment.  That looks pretty bad! And it's taking away funding from the other districts, because the taxes follow the students (when someone transfers into this online program, their local district loses some funds and the Union district gains some funds)  How do these numbers compare with the rest of the state? I've heard our public schools are pretty bad, all over.",yebyen,2025-05-03T19:01:17,2
Their in person passing rate appears to be over 95% with 300 in person and only 4 failed.  The issue with online schooling is in many cases it's people who have either been booted from regular schooling or have other issues.  I'm not saying it's a great district I am saying this is a decision that is usually made with significant public debate and was snuck into an unrelated measure.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-03T19:07:39,3
