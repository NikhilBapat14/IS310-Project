"The headline should read, “[Israeli Terrorist Sympathizer and Pro Genocide Politician](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-ben-gvir-baruch-goldstein-meir-kahane-memorial-martyrs-)…”  Let’s not mince words. He wants Palestinians wiped from this earth and he met with republicans.   Remember, kids, being anti-Israeli-induced-genocide means you hate Jews and are a terrorist sympathizer who should be removed from the country if possible, but being pro-Muslim-genocide and an actual terrorist sympathizer will get you a meeting with republicans at Trump’s place.",GimmeDatSideHug,2025-04-23T22:47:28,28

The Zionist far right Israelis are just as bad as Hitler was to their own people. Obviously they didn't learn anything from that time period.,TheGCO,2025-04-23T21:31:48,36

He...he's advocating for bombing food and aid depots. And the GOP leaders he met with were on board with it. We are 100% the villains of the 21st century now.,LordSiravant,2025-04-24T01:36:45,3

"Sadly you're correct and it pains me as a Jewish person. Today I was talking about how 238 Venezuelans were sent to CECOT and 80% had no criminal records. In the US and abroad. Some very pro Israel Jewish people had nothing but animosity towards my comment. Like rounding up people without trial, without a guilty verdict of a serious felony, is literally what Hitler did to Jews. And they don't care?   I guess I'm a Zionist in the sense I believe Israel has a right to exist. But that doesn't mean I'm anti Palestinian. And the longer the war goes on, the more I feel the hostages aren't the goal, not is just getting rid of hamas. But to remove all the Palestinians from Gaza. And that doesn't sit right with me.",mces97,2025-04-23T21:45:52,38

"Thank you for this. The mob mentality runs rampant in every society, but it’s those that do not align with the status quo, who can get the rest of us to at least question our beliefs. Maybe some of those questions will lead to the right answers, whatever they may be.",CAFritoBandito,2025-04-23T23:04:13,10
