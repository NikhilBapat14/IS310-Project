"No, 10% sounds like an additional 10% tax on American consumers.  Why are we trying to sanewash this? Would any American WANT to increase their income tax by 10%? Or their state sales tax by 10%?",missussunsfan,2025-05-07T09:26:33,11

Trump's election message was lower prices.  Trump's actual message higher prices are lower prices because higher prices are on the way.  ,arilupe,2025-05-07T09:18:23,3

A not insignificant portion of Americans have been complaining for years about the need to raise taxes.  It's suddenly a problem now that it's happening.,Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T11:22:42,-4
Raise taxes on whom?   I’ve seen a lot of calls for raising taxes on the highest earners that hoard wealth. I’ve never once heard somebody say that single mothers or families in poverty don’t pay enough in taxes.  You need to be more genuine if you want people to take you seriously.,missussunsfan,2025-05-07T11:25:31,4
"And the largest part of proposed tariffs would be paid directly by large companies who are part of the wealth hoarding problem you describe.   Oh, those companies are passing on those ""taxes"" directly to consumers?  What do you think would happen with any other taxes they're charged?  If Amazon or McDonald's minimum wage suddenly went up to $30/hour, would they just shrug and pay it? Or raise their prices?  In magic Democrat land, why are tariffs the only mystical thing that mega corporations pass on to consumers?",Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T11:32:34,-2
"We all know that prices would go up if workers started earning a living wage, and that's a tradeoff many of us are perfectly willing to make. Extra tariffs just funnel more money to the government, which isn't necessarily bad depending on your perspective. But I'd love to see more of the former and less of the latter. The difference being more money in the pockets of working people vs. less money in the pockets of working people.",Dimitri3p0,2025-05-07T11:47:14,3
">If Amazon or McDonald's minimum wage suddenly went up to $30/hour, would they just shrug and pay it? Or raise their prices?  They'd probably raise their prices, but if you want to find out how much would be ""reasonable"" (vs just price gouging), you'd have to look at what percent of a McDonalds meal's cost is labor vs raw goods vs real estate vs marketing and overhead. There are, of course, second order effects of the cost of their raw goods also probably increasing if the labor going into those is also more expensive (e.g. meat packing plant workers getting paid more).  But we can take a look at [this map of Big Mac prices](https://pantryandlarder.com/mccheapest) and see that while there's some correlation of prices and state minimum wages, it's not that strong. Illinois has a much higher minimum wage than surrounding states, but their Big Macs aren't noticeably more expensive. The Northeast has higher prices, but considering that they also have higher real estate costs and probably longer logistics lines to get beef, as well as higher nearby income, it shouldn't be too surprising. A lot of the really expensive burgers just seem to be from McDonalds locations that are next to highways, presumably banking on travelers more interested in convenience than in saving a buck or two.  >What do you think would happen with any other taxes they're charged?  Well, if it's a tax on profits then there's not that much they *can* do, Presumably they're already trying to maximize profits, so saying ""we're going to take 15% of your profits"" won't actually change any of the calculus.  This is in pretty stark contrast with tariffs, where the increased costs of goods will turn profitable sales into unprofitable sales unless costs are changed.",chowderbags,2025-05-07T12:34:35,1
Does raising prices result in more or less money in the pockets of working people?  And what about the pockets of people who are un/under employees?  Does raising prices on consumer goods give them more money?,Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T13:17:40,1
">Well, if it's a tax on profits then there's not that much they can do, Presumably they're already trying to maximize profits, so saying ""we're going to take 15% of your profits"" won't actually change any of the calculus.  Large corporations are famously non-chalant about taking in less in profits, after all.",Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T13:16:30,1
"It's not a question or whether or not they're nonchalant, it's a question of math. They're already doing everything in their power to maximize revenue and minimize costs. Revenue - costs = profit. Where do you think they'd squeeze more profit out of in response to higher taxes on corporate income? Any business answer you give would be equally applicable without the corporate taxes. The only actual answer would be lobbying and/or political donations to try to get politicians to lower taxes, but that's got nothing to do with consumer prices.  Compare that with tariffs where the revenue - costs become revenue - (costs*X). In that case it might make sense to do stuff like raise prices to sell fewer units, because if you try to keep the same price your margins might be lower (or turn negative, e.g. selling for less than you paid).",chowderbags,2025-05-07T13:40:34,1
"You don't think Amazon or Walmart wouldn't raise prices to increase profits?  They don't now because they're trying to remain competitive.  If the government starts taking, say, 10% of their profits, suddenly all these companies have an excuse to raise prices at the same time.  Still competitive.  Still raising prices.",Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T13:54:26,1
"> You don't think Amazon or Walmart wouldn't raise prices to increase profits?  To be clear, if we're talking about the corporate income tax scenario, then the taxation is on a percentage of the profits. So when you ask if they could ""raise prices to increase profits"", the obvious answer is no, because if they could increase profits by raising prices, they'd already be doing so. Do you think Walmart isn't already maximally greedy?  >They don't now because they're trying to remain competitive. If the government starts taking, say, 10% of their profits, suddenly all these companies have an excuse to raise prices at the same time. Still competitive. Still raising prices.  A) Raising prices reduces sales. Walmart (and other retailers) already do the math on selling X units at N cost vs selling Y units at M cost. The math ends up looking roughly like an upside down U, where the left side of the U represents maximum units sold, but no profit on the item, and the right side represents maximum profit on each sale, but very few units sold. Their goal is to set prices so they're at the highest point on the ∩. Shifting price higher would mean that they're getting lower overall returns.  B) If companies that are ostensibly in competition get together to create an agreement to raise prices, that's called [price fixing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing), and it's illegal under the Sherman Antitrust Act (and under the laws of many states).",chowderbags,2025-05-07T14:16:54,1
"Oh no!  Our mega corporations would never do anything illegal.  Or just realize every company is being charged more in taxes and slowly raise prices as their competition does.  I swear this is insanity.  You're literally arguing that corporations wouldn't raise prices to recover lost profits in a thread about prices going up due to tariffs.  If companies are so worried about losing sales due to raising prices, why don't they just keep their prices lower and pay for the increased tariffs out of their existing profits?",Toobin4Tommy,2025-05-07T14:21:13,1
"I have literally explained the difference between corporate income taxes and tariffs to you several times. If you don't understand at this point, then I can't help you. Try picking up a textbook on microeconomics.",chowderbags,2025-05-07T14:49:10,1
