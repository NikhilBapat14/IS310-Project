"He thinks this is a faucet he can just turn off and on.  UPS is mass laying off people.  Ports will have to start laying off people.  Independent truckers will lose their trucks since they are out of work.  Goods can't be teleported around the world yet.  We are *contracting* as a nation and you can't just flip a switch and reverse all that logistical destruction.  The deeper and longer this goes, the more *fucked* we all are long-term.",SidewaysFancyPrance,2025-04-29T14:06:58,19

"There is also no reason to trade with us or invest in him going back on tariffs because the moment he throws another fit he will triple the tariff from before. So businesses won't hire people back until things are stable, people will not get their businesses or trucks back.   When you have a mentally unstable leader there is no reason to make deals with him. He goes back on all of his deals.",TheJadeGoddess,2025-04-29T14:41:16,2
Actually the trucks will be sold to some Indian or Pakistani who will buy it with 3-4 other people and they will break every single trucking law and work 3 at a time and get shipments across the states within record time from 24/7 driving. Â   They will also demo a bunch of your bridges like they have in BCâ€¦.,SuperRayGun666,2025-04-29T14:33:39,1
