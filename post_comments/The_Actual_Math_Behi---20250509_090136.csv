">If you thought Elon Musk was really trying to cut costs, you weren’t in on the joke  Nobody thought Musk was trying to cut costs. Everybody knows. We know, Musk knows, Trump knows, his cabinet knows, the Republicans in Congress know, right-wing influencers know, the users on the conservative subreddit know, there is not a single person with half a brain who doesn't know that it's just a convenient lie to keep the dumbest of the MAGA voters pacified. The kind who get their ""truths"" from unsourced Facebook memes. Nobody really believes that Musk ever set out to cut costs. He set out to deconstruct the US government, hurt people, avoid lawsuits, get his hands on citizens' data, and funnel billions more of taxpayer money into his own pockets. That's understood by everyone involved.   On the other hand, it's nice to have an article like this detailing just how blatantly incompetent even his slim attempts at upholding the lie have been.",OnDrugsTonight,2025-05-09T09:27:45,15

"It has nothing to do with efficiency. He’s got his little goon, hackers, transferring and collecting data information. That’s it then it will all be uploaded to AI and will run the country. Good luck.",techcore2023,2025-05-09T12:09:39,2
