Getting rid of the generals that would push back on using the military against its own people? Getting ready to occupy our cities?,MidnightWorried6992,2025-05-05T16:08:27,56
"By Gabe Whisnant — Breaking News Editor |  Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday ordered the active-duty military to reduce its number of four-star generals by 20 percent, part of a broader Trump administration effort to streamline the military's top leadership ranks.  The directive, outlined in a memo dated Monday, also applies to the National Guard, which has been instructed to cut 20% of its senior leadership positions. Hegseth described the move as necessary to eliminate ""redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.""

"Cost savings has always been a cover for consolidating power and weakening the bureaucracy.   Americans really need to start learning about other cultures. It’s hard to tell who the Heritage Foundation got more inspiration from; Xi or Orban.  What Xi Jinping did to the CCP is looking awfully familiar. Highly condensed state, party, and military bodies, subsuming several of the chair roles himself. Streamlined staff and departments. Shifted decision making and centers of power from state to party bodies. Placed himself as the core of the party identity. Political and military promotion are based on personal and political loyalty. He halved the number of members in the PSC and CMC and gutted the military and political power of regional governors. The entire system is now built around ensuring personal loyalty and surgically removing any apparatus that could challenge his authority.   In the U.S. it’s obviously a little different, but make no mistake, a Uniparty is the end result, and it wouldn’t be surprising if the church is used as a stand in for state sponsored political indoctrination. It already is to an extent, it’s just voluntary. When religion is mandated in schools again it’s going to be balls to the wall “conservative” indoctrination.   Republican uniparty good, but communism bad.  The Chinese have a tendency to take foreign things and transform them with distinctly Chinese characteristics.   The GOP is basically doing the same thing in the other direction, mixing flavors, (think Russias oligarchy snatching up public resources and Orbans dismantling of critical media and civil society) and 90% of their subscribers will dismiss comments like this because it’s “ridiculous” someone would compare US conservatism to communism. But most of those people couldn’t describe communism, or how the CCP is or is not communist, without ChatGPT.",GenerationalNeurosis,2025-05-06T01:12:37,2

">We are talking about maybe 1.5 million dollars in salaries and benefits versus the flexibility and experience of the command structure.  That is not correct. Eliminating bureaucracy is a pretty conventional way of improving efficiency. Its like if a corporation got rid of some VPs to streamline the bureaucracy. It could lead to much higher savings, than the couple of salaries.   Of course, if you believe that the current Pentagon is the **most**  efficient organization possible, then removing the number of generals will not improve efficiency and lead to higher savings.

"""redundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership.""       Redundancies are there for a reason. Systems need give, insurance, safety net.     In this case, competent militaries the world over, deliberately retain  more Generals and Admirals than needed. So that if disaster strikes , and a large scale conflict emerges. They have enough experienced, senior staff to command the increased number of troops.       20% reduction. I doubt past defence secretaries missed this, as an area of reduction.

You're right. He's removing a lot of the horizontal command structure and melding different agencies into having one boss. He's removing defiance. A president's power is very reliant on the general. Usually in dictatorships it's the general that takes complete hold of the government because of the military.

This was an decision made with no reason beyond ""we don't want these generals here"".    This administration keeps claiming ""efficiency"" as justification for firing people.  Those decisions are being made with no true evaluation, just near random firings or firings that are easy (like all employees on probation).  And before you say ""they were on probation, fire them!"" understand that probation in the government isn't due to poor performance, it's usually do to getting promoted or getting hired into a new position.  The people they fired were some of the highest performers who had been promoted into higher ranking jobs.  They did zero research before firing them, just choosing them because they COULD fire them without running into employment contracts getting in the way (once probation is done, it becomes much harder to fire a government employee most of the time).    They want to burn down the current government and military to build it as they see fit, which isn't a good thing.
