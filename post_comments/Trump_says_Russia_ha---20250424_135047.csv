The negotiator approached the waiting reporters and gleefully announced that the bank robbers have made a 'pretty big concession' by stopping short of robbing the entire bank.  One reporter points out that bank security had already stopped them from doing that and wanted to know how the negotiator intended to get the robbers to stand down.  The negotiator asked how the reporter got into his country and sent a threatening email demanding she leave immediately.,Lord0fHats,2025-04-24T13:52:39,88
Russia is the aggressor. It’s not their country to “seize.” Appeasement to totalitarian expansionists have never worked in the past. You’d be dumb to think it would work this time.   No peace in Ukraine until all orcs are off of Ukrainian soil (or fertilizer under it).,AKMarine,2025-04-24T13:56:09,18

Trump is now the press secretary of Russia or what?,thieh,2025-04-24T13:55:23,10
">Asked what Putin is doing now to help forge a peace deal, Trump responded, “stopping taking the whole country, pretty big concession.”  He finally said it!! I've been waiting for this. I kept wondering what concessions the trump admin was asking russia to make. I didn't see any answer until now. Finally, he says the quiet part out loud: russia doesn't have to make any concessions.  The worst part of the ""at least russia isn't taking over the entire country"" thing is that there's nothing stopping russia from taking over the entire country at a later time. So even if russia were to agree to a ""peace deal"" now, it would just be temporary until they're ready to resume their invasion and take over all of Ukraine. And remember, if they were to get all of Ukraine, they'd be in a great position to invade more countries.  So idk, maybe arming Ukraine as much as possible would be a good idea?",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T14:18:04,8

"Ukraine for their size kicked the living shit out of Putin's Russia. Their unique battlefield use of strategic drone and missiles use has revolutionized warfare going forward. The EU and it's allies will continue to support Ukraine til the end. Putin's Russia is in shambles. Their infrastructure outside of Moscow and St Petersburg is third world at best. Their energy, tech, auto, and airline industries are in shambles. They've lost a majority of their best tanks and air defense systems. They can't even keep their Navy in the Black Sea. The place has turned into a dump. Ukraine and Europe will prevail.",williamgman,2025-04-24T14:02:43,7
"Let's see Russia gets US recognition of Crimea, sanctions removal, hold any territory they currently occupy, promised economic cooperation with the US. Jump-starting their economy and speeding up their recovery to reconstitute their military much faster than any previous estimate.   Ukraine gets extorted by their rare earth minerals, energy resources, energy infrastructure, no security guarantees. Effectively crippling their recovery and guaranteeing another invasion in the coming years.  Seems like a great deal for the longtime ally of the US, Russia! Who certainly isn't still doing information warfare, sabotage, and cyber operations against the US...... Wait a second",Ok-Lets-Talk-It-Out,2025-04-24T14:03:59,6

"As if the United States, under Trump, were seeking to take control of Canada's water resources by pretending they hadn't invaded the country.
