"$ stolen, zero accountability. The only question is will we have a free and fair election. I say no. Voter suppression is taking place right now. Will the democrats in government do anything? This is no joke, we are quickly becoming Russia",Own-Resource221,2025-04-17T23:18:29,17
"It's pretty apparent now. Patronage politics, pay to play and corruption is running rampant now in the White House. We all saw this coming a mile away but didn't realize how deep this shit was going to get. All the DOGE shit IS the distraction.   Now Powell is to blame? What an imbecile. We are doomed folks.",Amazing_Bluejay9322,2025-04-17T22:43:29,9
"In the end, it is a near certainty that DOGE will _cost_ us money, it will not save a damn penny.  It is the fraud, waste, and abuse.",Timothy303,2025-04-18T01:04:57,10

Well he promised to save 2 trillion.  Then he said 1 trillion.  Then just last week or so he said $150 billion.  Basically he’s saving almost nothing.  And the “saving” is from closing legitimate agencies like USUAID and CFPB.  It’s not the waste fraud and abuse that he’s claiming.,HereWeGo5566,2025-04-18T06:47:51,3
"This is solely on the republican Congress for allowing DOGE (Musk) to infiltrate our government, stealing data, fire workers, shut down critical infrastructure, and selling off government assets for their own profit and gain. It's one of the biggest government thefts in US history.",baby_budda,2025-04-18T07:13:13,3

"Secondary goals, for the wonderfully upstanding, definitely not total piece-of-shit fascists representing Project 2025. DOGE existed for the purpose of keeping Musk out of prison, which is where he was likely headed by his own admission had Harris won. But DOGE took care of all those inspectors generals that were prying into his companies. Funny how those particular departments were among the first to get the Idiocracy chainsaw. Just laaaaughing away with Tucker Carlson how ""I'm fucked"" if Harris wins. Absolute madness.",donnie_dark0,2025-04-18T00:32:17,12
