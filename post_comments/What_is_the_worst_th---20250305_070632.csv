"For me that metric has totally changed since DJT. Twice impeached, convicted felon, convicted predator and yet here we are. So it would have to be something cataclysmic at this point, like nuking Greenland or it becoming overwhelmingly and factually clear that he's working directly for Putin (although the latter is pretty clear, IMO, and his followers are still on board). Maybe like the movie ""Absolute Power"" where he gets caught physically murdering someone with zero doubt about who did it.",thewoodsiswatching,2025-03-05T20:51:27,14
S/he can be as abjectly stupid as Donald J Trump.  I once thought George W Bush was a litmus test for stupid and lazy. And I say that as someone who saw his poor leadership as the Governor of Texas firsthand.  I was so very wrong.,anti-torque,2025-03-06T01:07:24,15
"A once in a lifetime pandemic with a horrible and incompetent response that kills 1.2 million people, destroys the economy and causes a massive public health crisis. This negative response then causes them to lose the next election, which triggers an angry reaction in which they try to overthrow American democracy in a desperate bid to stay in power by coercing a violent mob of supporters to storm the US Capitol.  Luckily this person was subsequently impeached, removed from office and imprisoned and we never heard from him again.",One_Bison_5139,2025-03-08T02:24:08,11
I'm at the point if a Sovereign Wealth Fund doesn't get people to perk up then nothing will. Or the fact the President is charging 1 million for a group meeting and 5 million for a personal meeting. It's just blanket corruption and I'm not sure how in the world this helps the average worker.,Savethecannolis,2025-03-06T05:34:06,8
"An economic depression is the worst thing that can happen to an administration. When people are affected, they put their cultural or social thoughts on the back burner and will look for a way out of this situation to return to their previous situation.  Although most people will use the election to have someone solve this problem and go with the opposition party, that is how the Democrats won a supermajority in Congress under President FDR.",Isacobs_35160_LHM,2025-03-05T21:13:55,6
"I think that judging presidents over the last 25 years has been EXTREMELY subjective.   Take off your hindsight goggles. I'm about to hit you with some questions for if you're president.   * You're president and there's the largest attack on American soil since Pearl harbor - seemingly unprovoked. What do you do?  * You're president and there's a pending economic crash many are likening to the Great depression. What do you do?  * You're president and there's a novel virus decimating the world - not just America. What do you do?   Did Biden have a major crisis? There was egregious inflation largely rooted in lingering effects of the pandemic. I guess Gaza, Ukraine, and Taiwan? I don't know if global political chess is in the same vein as crisis in the homeland like the others, though. The Southern border? I don't know if that's quite the same level as unexpected catastrophe though...   All of this context to say the worst things that can happen is an unexpected catastrophe in the homeland or an explicit act of war from a big player like China against the US that sparks WW3.   The absolute worst would definitely be WW3.",J-Colio,2025-03-08T21:39:14,3
"Realistically? Die. Almost a fifth of all Presidents have died in office. With the way Washington's aging, it's highly likely that most of us will see it happen again.",AgentQwas,2025-03-11T00:38:41,3
"Be impeached and convicted, I guess. Perhaps being laughed at by Congress repeatedly during his State of the Union address would be a close second.",Dr_CleanBones,2025-03-08T13:17:43,1
"The worst thing for Trump could be the US defaulting on its debt, but the Democrats don’t have the stones to play the only hand they’ve got.",I_luv_sneksss,2025-03-08T18:38:56,1

That he is so successful that democrats vote to repeal presidential term limits.    I think that’s the current nightmare for the left.,Funklestein,2025-03-08T10:06:53,0
"Based on recent events. Nothing.       In the past, candidates would be dropped by their own parties, disowned by the public, be considered a black stain in the country's history for doing 1/10 of what the current POTUS has done.        Nowadays, people do not care enough to even bother. I frankly think that POTUS could start a literal war to try and take over Central and South America and people would still back him up.",vksdann,2025-03-08T11:41:53,0
W does look a helluva lot better than he did in 08 but shame on him for  his silence. I can’t even f’ing imagine being in that position and choosing to keep my mouth shut. WTF?!?!,Cluefuljewel,2025-03-06T20:02:04,3
"I agree. When GWB was President, I thought I’d never see a worse one in my lifetime. How wrong I was. At least GWB was trying to export our form of government to other countries, not trying outright to destroy it.",Dr_CleanBones,2025-03-08T13:20:19,3

It doesn't help the people. We have the first president in history to have actual contempt for our constitution and democracy and loathes the average person.,MissJAmazeballs,2025-03-08T10:16:04,6
"Depends on the president. If you have a billionaire sociopath with no history of social servitude and has utter contempt for the non-wealthy class, an economic depression would benefit him and his friends and would probably be the end goal in the first place.",MissJAmazeballs,2025-03-08T10:12:32,4
"Ain't it funny how the people who were completely horrified by that, are the same people who are 100% on board with the current debacle?  Republicans truly are sheep.",satyrday12,2025-03-08T10:35:43,7
I'll take an adulterous blowjob over this current insanity any day.,Mztmarie93,2025-03-08T10:42:22,5
Was it the BJ or did the public recoil at the witch hunt and rank hypocrisy demonstrated by two adulterers and a child molester impeaching him for the same thing (or less) they're guilty of?,EdShouldersKneesToes,2025-03-08T11:39:01,3
"Republicans passed that amendment after FDR,  not Democrats. Of course, I'd love another Obama term, so I'm game if they are.",Mztmarie93,2025-03-08T10:45:25,1
"If W spoke out, it would sway absolutely nobody. Trumpies have already disowned him, even though it was them who were 100% behind all of his debacles.",satyrday12,2025-03-08T10:31:36,5

"I think it says more about the Dems that he is still welcomed and respected, given his treatment of women, but yes, mock outrage serves nobody. Well, it helps Trump, but nobody else.",Impossible_Pop620,2025-03-08T10:37:35,-2
"I don't think that was the choice. It was Trump or...er, Kamala, that's it. I suspect that her sexual history probably would've played a role in the election, but there wasn't really time. Pretty sure she participated in some adulterous behaviour, so perhaps it hurt her a little, that it wasn't spread more widely.",Impossible_Pop620,2025-03-08T10:48:02,-1
The popularity increase? Pretty sure it was the BJ. Most men can only dream of having that kind of unquestioned authority over a teen girl.,Impossible_Pop620,2025-03-08T12:13:25,-1
The bipartisan vote that 47 House Democrats and 16 Senate Democrats voted for and then was ratified by 41 states?    The states that rejected it were Massachusetts and Oklahoma while 5 states didn't even vote on it.  No democrats involved right?,Funklestein,2025-03-08T11:13:56,1
Yeah you’re right. It just would have felt right and good for him to stand up.,Cluefuljewel,2025-03-08T10:51:26,1
