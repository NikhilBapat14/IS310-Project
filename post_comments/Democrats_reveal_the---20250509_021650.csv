"Just about every district should be in play. If Democrats can't seize on Trump 2-Dolls and all the incompetent sycophants making irrational decisions, deportation of citizens, ICE breaking into innocent people's houses, universities being blackmailed and told what they can teach, law firms being shaken down for payments, Trump, his wife and families cryptocurrency scams Etc, all allowed to exist because of Republicans sitting on their hands going we don't see anything wrong.

"They're not going to win those seats if they don't fight back. Look at Labour in the UK. They've done everything the Tories have done, they've gone just as far-right (and arguably worse on trans issues than the Tories) and they're going to get destroyed in the next election as Nigel Farage and Reform would dominate and get a mandate to create a fascist ethnostate in the UK.",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-09T02:39:15,2

"Instead of 'revealing' their top targets in 2026 or even 2028, why democrats not focus on the programs and people being canceled in 2025?",Agnos,2025-05-09T02:35:42,0
"This is not only pointless, it makes no strategic sense. So you are going to announce your prime targets over a year in advance?

The future of Democrats is really murky right now. Sloooooooooooooooooooooow reactions and absence of leaderships or strategy. Those winning plans must be based on something more serious than procrastination,Livid-Perception4377,2025-05-09T05:46:03,0
They have to be willing to stop increasing the debt limit if they actually want to win big. Trump can sustain the economy to some degree if given unlimited money to spend,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-09T02:25:43,-3
"Feels like we just finished the last election and they're already talking about 2026. Not surprised though, both sides start planning way early now. It’ll be interesting to see if any of those top targets are actually flippable or if it’s just fundraising talk again.",ModernnMuse,2025-05-09T06:16:47,0

"The Democrats don’t have a congressional majority. They need to plan for the 2026 midterms to get one. That will help keep Trump in check and could maybe, just maybe, be enough to impeach him and Vance (assuming the Democrats gets 2/3 of the Senate, which they didn’t have in 2021, and if the Republicans won’t impeach him for attempting a coup, they’ll never impeach him).",Hero-Firefighter-24,2025-05-09T06:47:05,4

"Right all the little ideas about it we just push this issue or that messaging. None of it is real resistance.

">Let Trump deal with the hangover  The problem is if we don't raise the debt limit Trump will continue to golf and eat hamburgers just fine. He's completely insulated from actual consequences.   People who rely on social security to actually put food in their mouths will *start to die* though, people who rely on Medicare and Medicaid to get their medicine will start to die as well.   The people who suffer the actual consequences from the US defaulting on its financial obligations won't actually be any of the people making the decisions, it'll be normal people.  This is always what it comes down to, every single time, the Republicans look at that conundrum and go ""lol, sucks for the poors, we are holding out until you agree to some ridiculous demand"" and the Democrats cave because they give a shit.",thrawtes,2025-05-09T05:56:47,2

"Yeah, folks that hang around Reddit seriously underrate the cultural swing right that's occurred worldwide.   In hindsight, Western leaders really did make a massive mistake in the early to mid 2010's in not confronting Putin harder then (and Biden was apparently one person in Obama's world who felt that way, he's turned out to be correct). Putin's actions in Syria were a major reason for the migration that occurred then, and it received huge backlash in Europe and has been one of the major reasons for the rise of right wing populism even though that issue has settled down for years.   There is a reason why center left parties in Europe have capitulated on immigration and it is because the masses have been talked into it being a bad thing.",95Daphne,2025-05-09T07:39:56,2
"> Name some concrete actions  Not voting to confirm Trump nominees would be a good start...but weird I have to be the one to come up with action plan...republicans never seem to have problem forcing their views on us not encumbered with tradition nor even a parliamentarian...

That's the direction it is going to keep heading if they continue this momentum until '28.    People need to feel some economic discomfort to ensure seats flip.  I'm not advocating for cuts to social services by any means - quite the opposite.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-09T06:22:22,2
"Every year 68,000 Americans die because we don't guarantee Healthcare as a right. How many more die because their social security already sucks? Or because the minimum wage hasn't been raised in decades?  How many more will die with either another 4 years of trump/vance or best case some kind of slim majority of Democrats that doesn't do anything?   Look at the stimulus checks Trump gave out last time. Did those potentially save some lives? Probably. But they also cost countless lives by making Trump more popular, the Republican party more popular, and so forth.    Also you assume Republicans would default. That's a pretty big assumption. What they might do is just abolish the debt ceiling. Which could lead to a temporary rise in interest rates. That's a far more likely consequence.    Democrats always like to come up with excuses for why they can't stand up to Republicans. They are far better at that than anything else",ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-09T12:58:05,1

>But that is not even what I am talking about...I want them to daily explain the values and lessons of the programs that are cut...I want them to say how important is education including higher education...I want them to give constitution classes on a daily basis  You are describing the role of media and academia here. Some of our elected representatives are media personalities and professors but I'm not electing those representatives to do these things.   It's reasonable to want them to do more town halls and speak about their platform though.,thrawtes,2025-05-09T05:54:14,3
"So you want town halls? Many congress critters have been holding those. Everything else you describe are things pundits do. Legislators aren’t media personalities.

How many more cuts and deaths will there be if Republicans control the government till 2032?   Ultimately by not standing up to Republicans we will see more inequality and no lack of progress for another generation. That's gonna lead to far more dead Americans than whatever this other guy is worried about.    We already have near 70k Americans dying every year because we lack m4a. How many years do Democrats want to let that continue? You are looking at millions of dead Americans if nothing is done for another generation on that,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-09T13:01:15,2
