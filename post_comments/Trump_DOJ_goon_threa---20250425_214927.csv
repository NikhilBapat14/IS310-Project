How can I as a simple citizen effect real change?  I’ve protested.  I boycott certain companies and retailers. I keep a close eye on local and national politics.    My view is that it has to get waaaay worse before the larger public acts.  And that act will be violent by necessity.      Then the US will not be the US any longer.

"This is related to the topic of UAP.  - On Monday, former senior advisor to JFK, Nixon, LBJ & Ford - called Harald Malmgren gave a 4 hour interview describing this knowledge of UFO crash retrievals in the 60s and further back. Malmgren died age 88 in Feb.  - Later that day, his Wikipedia page was nominated for deletion, alongside his daughter, Pippa Malmgren and former senior DOD official, Christopher Mellon.  - Jimmy Wales stepped in to stop Harald’s page being deleted. It is only the 7th time in 10 years that he’s done this.  - Christopher Mellon’s page has now been deleted. If the name “Mellon” is familiar, he’s from the Mellon family: Carnegie Mellon  - An organisation, named Gorilla Skeptics is systematically controlling any and all pages on Wikipedia related to the UAP topic and disallowing any narrative other than their own, biased, ideologically driven perspective.  So, there’s more going on here than you think.  This is the DOJ pushing Wikipedia to stop the pages of key former US intel & military figures being defaced by debunkers.  Let that sink in, the DOJ is starting a fight with Wikipedia - on the side of UAP/UFO disclosure.  This is Harald’s interview: https://youtu.be/09KP8XVf5nY",poetry-linesman,2025-04-26T14:17:52,1

The irony is that conservatives actually hate America, because at the end of the day America is the Founding Fathers and the US Constitution and not a lot else, and they hate that the Constitution stands in the way of them having Trump as a king who can do whatever he wants with impunity. ",jgilla2012,2025-04-26T02:00:23,24
