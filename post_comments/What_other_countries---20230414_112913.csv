"Hungary lost a lot of territory after WW1 and WW2. There is a significant Hungarian minority in most neighboring countries, most significantly in Romania. They were given the right to vote in Hungarian elections by Orban and they continue to heavily support him today. It was all a part of his electoral strategy.",momasana,2023-04-16T10:06:42,10
"Israel comes to mind immediately when you're talking about a heavily influential diaspora.  I would expect the same from a lot of Central American countries where their working class has migrated to the US.  I'll bet they still have a lot to say about what's going on at home.  This could, or could not, have the desired effect.  They could have been fleeing something, and are trying to use the extra money they make here to influence things back home.",Shankar_0,2023-04-15T11:34:25,6
"Turkey's government under Erdogan is strongly supported by the diaspora, he'd have actually lost his last election if it weren't for the diaspora [he got nearly 60% in the diaspora, but only 42% at home](https://politicstoday.org/the-turkish-diasporas-voting-preference-in-the-24-june-elections/)",SnooBooks1701,2023-04-15T06:08:48,9
There are more Lebanese people outside of Lebanon than inside the country. Diaspora votes constitute a large part of the parliamentary elections.,taztuz,2023-04-15T17:45:01,4
">he most obvious would be the Jewish diaspora  Eh, yes and no.  There are very strong cultural ties between Diaspora Jews and Israeli Jews. Politically speaking, it's not infrequent for individual diaspora Jews to become heavily involved in Israeli Politics. (Like Sheldon Adelson or Roman Abramovich) but that is usually if they align with already existing Israeli Politics.  The overall public opinion of Diaspora Jews has very little influence on Isreal. Most Jews in Israel are right-wing or centrists. Most Jews in America or left-wing or Liberal. Although most Jews in America will say they support Isreal, the country, when you poll the Israeli Government, there is very high disapproval. Isreal doesn't really spend much time trying to change those opinions and not infrequently takes active steps to antagonize American Jews, For instance, Isreal's refusal to recognize Reform and Conservative Judaism (the movements that represent most American Jews).  Also, contrary to popular belief, if you poll American Jews on what issues matter most to them, it's the same issues as everyone else. Very few Jews make Isreal a top priority when voting or donating money to campaigns",loselyconscious,2023-04-16T13:15:00,2
