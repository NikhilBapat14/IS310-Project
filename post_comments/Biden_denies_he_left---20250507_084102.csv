"I think he‚Äôs wrong. If Biden was the official nominee, the outcome would‚Äôve been a lot worse for Democrats.   The states that Harris won by single digits would‚Äôve flipped red with him at the top of the ticket.",MCKlassik,2025-05-07T09:27:21,170
"Biden argued his term was so successful, it was difficult to hand over leadership to a new generation immediately, as he'd initially intended.   ""What we had set out to do, no one thought we could do,"" he said. ""I'd become so successful in our agenda, it was hard to say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to stop now.' I meant what I said when I started, that I'm preparing to hand this to the next generation, the transition of government. Things moved so quickly that it made it difficult to walk away.""  During the interview, Biden also asked if he could get a scoop of chocolate ice cream and make it vanilla!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T09:19:12,64
Smartest thing he has ever said.,Pugnatum_Forte,2025-05-07T09:08:05,75
">When asked if he left the 2024 presidential race too late, Biden said that he didn't believe his decision ultimately changed the results of the election in an interview with BBC News reporter Nick Robinson.  >""I don't think it would have mattered,"" Biden said in his first interview since leaving the White House.  I read this is ""neither Harris *nor I* could have beaten Donald Trump.""  Which is meaningful, since he had already beaten Trump once.  So much for that hyper-successful presidency of his, I guess.",NotAnotherRedditAcc2,2025-05-07T10:57:31,16
"The end result I think would have been the same. That said, Harris was a hugely unpopular candidate.  I don't believe he would have swept every single swing state if they had run someone who wasn't so grating.",the_house_from_up,2025-05-07T09:12:24,26
He left a month too early.  Harris‚Äô polls peaked a month before the election.  If Harris‚Äô campaign was a month shorter she might have ridden the ‚Äúnew candidate‚Äù optimism to a victory.,RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-05-07T09:27:09,23
He would have had to leave in 2019,woailyx,2025-05-07T09:38:47,10
"He shouldn‚Äôt have been running in the first place. Never mind the national security issues revolving around a man who can‚Äôt even remember where he is being in charge of our nuclear codes, or the nationwide, multimedia collusion scheme by the left to gaslight the American people that obliterated the media‚Äôs credibility and reputation, but it was straight up elder abuse by the Democrats trotting him out there when he should have been in a nursing home or at the very least off enjoying the final chapter of his life.   All because they hate Trump so much that there is no depth that they won‚Äôt sink to in their quest to defeat him.",Goldwings13,2025-05-07T10:46:53,9

He's right. Running on those policies would have lost no matter what.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-07T10:46:55,7

You might be right. I remember Kamala had a nice little bump for a month or so right after Biden stepped down. Then when she started doing interviews everyone remembered how much of an idiot she was.,synn89,2025-05-07T10:20:05,76
"Unless he was going to leave early enough for the democrats to have a real primary, you're correct.",mojo276,2025-05-07T10:57:22,11
"Maybe. But considering her performance in the 2020 primaries where she went from front runner to dropping out less than a month later, would she have even been the nominee in an open primary?",r777m,2025-05-07T16:21:04,3
"Alright, a flawless campaign that spent a billion dollars and still lost to Donald Trump.  Are they ready to admit it was a bad candidate?  Because a flawless campaign run by a great candidate spending a billion dollars doesn't lose in a landslide to Donald Trump.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-07T09:39:17,161

"Horrible candidate aside, they still run their presidential campaigns like its 2008. Going on late night shows with Jimmy Kimmel or getting celebrity endorsements doesn't work anymore. Trump had it in the bag anyway, but him going on Joe Rogan probably got an even bigger chunk of the male vote. Plus, all of the memeable moments like the McDonalds or garbage truck photoshoots.",Gunsofglory,2025-05-07T11:47:13,30
"After the first person they paid a million dollars to twerk for her campaign, I just knew it was over for Trump.   üòÇ",Sad-Amoeba3186,2025-05-07T11:19:37,17
I thought at first maybe she had a shot. Then during her acceptance speech rather than tell people anything useful about herself she focused on attacking Trump. Like how many times do you use that same playbook before you realize it doesn't work? She didn't run a flawless campaign. She crashed and burned at her acceptance speech. The people running her campaign and the people at the DNC that picked her should never work in politics again. What an embarrassing campaign.,Coool_cool_cool_cool,2025-05-07T12:26:18,22

The rumor mill had claimed the Biden campaign was seeing Virginia and New Jersey flipping red if Biden ran lol.  Which would make sense considering how long it took Virginia to officially call their count with Harris running.,Rare_Cobalt,2025-05-07T10:10:03,69
Since the election I've always thought that Democrats owe Harris a thank you and an apology. She became the sacrificial lamb to prevent maybe the worst democratic presidental loss ever.,mojo276,2025-05-07T10:56:39,8
"The ole Nancy pelosi move. For the past 15 years she‚Äôs said, I‚Äôm going to allow the next generation to take the lead. She gets older, richer, and isn‚Äôt going anywhere. They don‚Äôt give a damn about anyone but themselves.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-07T12:51:19,16
