"MAGA's mini Chinese Cultural Revolution smashing intellectuals will destroy the economy and take decades to recover from just like its authoritarian, Moaist counterpart.   Authoritarians always go for the intellectuals first because they know dictators have more to fear from intelligent decency and principled critical analysis than from anything else.   But the voice of reason, though faint, is persistent.  Eventually it topples every dictator.  ",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-22T09:20:43,13

"Hey University of Florida, if you want to keep your status as a medical and business school, we expect you to stand up too.

"As you probably know, the ship has sailed on that. DeSantis had the laws changed so that he is the one that alone gets to pick college and university presidents, skirting Florida’s constitutional sunshine laws. He proceeded to destroy New College and placed the unqualified Ben Sasse as head of UF, where he proceeded to steal $17M to give to his political operatives. Fucking wild.   I think I read that the new speaker of the house is gunning for DeSantis, and besides highlighting DeSantis’ blatant corruption (y’all, it’s really, really bad with these guys - the whole lot), he’s also aiming to change the rules on hiring in the education dept to be more transparent (see less corrupt). DeSantis is pissed and whining like the white-booted baby he is.   I don’t trust any of them though. I’ll need to read the letter of the proposed law before I’ll believe the proposal is any better.",tackle_bones,2025-04-22T14:03:30,6
