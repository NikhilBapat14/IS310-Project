Art of the deal   Give the other side everything they want before making a deal.   Only makes sense if you think of the other side as our side,Rude_Egg_6204,2025-04-22T21:04:45,1

How do we think we hold any sway over ukraine? We stopped providing them arms. We don't speak for them.,Kroe,2025-04-22T21:22:20,1

"To be fair, Trump doesn't always say 'Yes' to Putin.  Indeed, he said a very emphatic 'No' to Putin when the Russian president asked him if he should release the compromising information he has on Trump.",crazybones,2025-04-23T06:52:38,1
"Most likely for Russia now. Even 35 years ago, when Ukraine was gaining independence, the voting was overwhelmingly Yes across the country, but barely over 50% Yes at Crimea. And now a lot of pro-Ukraine people moved elsewhere or died.",hsiale,2025-04-23T07:35:30,1
I think there has always been more people who identify as Russians living there.  In 2001 the census said 60%,Brilliant-Advisor958,2025-04-22T19:55:26,0
"This conflict is not about ethnic tribes arguing over land. Strictly speaking, modern 'Russians' is not an ethnic group; it's a 'superethnos' forcibly created out of different ethnic groups (incl. parts of Ukrainians, but lots, lots more) forged by political allegiance, high culture etc. In more familiar terms, being 'Russian' is like being 'British' (UK was far more honest with this, though). Also, Russian empire ('empire' being a key word) in all its iterations forced/s 'russianness' on everyone who could 'pass' (i.e. not too brown + an Orthodox Christian). So, people claiming themselves as 'Russians' in Crimea in 2001 really didn't mean anything; this self-identity was often based on fear, force of habit and other fluid things.  Also, Crimea was purged in 1945, everyone not 'Russian' enough (majority of then-population) was deported, and settlers from other places were forcibly moved to Crimea instead. To a much lesser extent, the similar processes are in place after 2014. So, for how long should you've been lived in some place to claim the moral right to decide the destiny of this land? And for how long you should have been removed to loose this right? (who told 'Palestine'?)",Unusual-Season-8923,2025-04-23T05:45:58,1
