"I know it's low on the list of things to hate about Trump, but I am just so sick of the way he describes things.  This is a bill.  People who use descriptive words to describe a bill might say things like ""comprehensive"" or ""long-awaited"" or ""beneficial"".  Calling a bill ""big and beautiful"" is such a tell that he doesn't understand a damn thing about it.  Every time I see him on TV nowadays, it causes me to say, ""Shut the fuck up"" as an automatic reaction.",KapahuluBiz,2025-05-09T16:39:40,75
Trump should receive a bill.   A bill from the rest of the world for all the chaos he's caused. With no service charge!,_L_R_S_,2025-05-09T15:57:57,20
"Every Democrat should be screaming from the rooftops that every Republican wants to steal your Medicare. The messaging is so damn easy. Call this for what it is: theft of your healthcare to pay the rich. Come on, guys. DNC, if you’re reading this…",Idk612345,2025-05-09T18:08:40,4
"Don't worry about a thing MAGAITES. You know me, I'm Donald J Trump. My name is on buildings all over the world. I fly in jets and have all the best women throwing themselves at my feet. I'm one of the richest men in the universe. If I tell you this is a great bill and you'll love it like you've never loved anything before, believe me! When have I ever told you something that was untrue?",TopEagle4012,2025-05-09T15:59:05,3

"“Medicaid you’ve got to be careful, cause a lot of MAGA’s on Medicaid. I’m telling you. If you don’t think so, you’re dead wrong,” Bannon said earlier this year.",Particular_Oil_7722,2025-05-09T21:43:35,2
"I think a lot of it will come down to how confident they are of their ability to manipulate the outcome of the midterm elections. All of the Republicans, MAGA and ""moderate"" alike, are absolutely chomping at the bit to take a chainsaw to Medicaid. But they also know that a huge number of MAGA voters rely on Medicaid. So for the Representatives in nominally vulnerable or purple districts, cutting life-saving care from 70 million Americans to hand those billions of dollars to their billionaire friends would, at least in theory, result in an electoral bloodbath - *if* the 2026 elections were free, fair, and non-manipulated. If, on the other hand, they can arrange things in a way that the vast majority of people either won't be able to vote, or they'd be able to count only the votes that go their way, it wouldn't really matter how many more people they kill in their quest to enrich themselves and the people they actually care for.   It's interesting to watch from the outside, because none of the Republicans actually argue about whether Medicaid should stay or not. They are all absolutely agreed that they want to slash it. All they argue about is what it'll do to their chance for reelection. They really are truly evil people.",OnDrugsTonight,2025-05-09T16:29:35,2

"Guessing trump will try to sell his Medicaid cuts as a states issue to get out from federal obligation match.

"Hypothetically if the bill did include no tax on tips, overtime, social security, reduced the salt tax limit, didn't tamper with entitlements, and raised the tax on the rich. How would democrats feel about their party if they opposed it? Would yous be in favor of your leaders voting against it?",Scorned_Guardian,2025-05-09T16:24:16,-8
"He has a vocabulary of less than 500 words. If it isn't big and beautiful, it's bad, terribly bad, very bad, and by the way, a lot of people have said it's bad. With tears in their eyes.",Sweary_Biochemist,2025-05-09T19:39:47,12
Trump could empty his diaper on the Resolute Desk and call it ‘big and beautiful’ and his cult would lap it up.,jimmygee2,2025-05-09T18:21:19,14
"Even beyond that superficial level that he uses to describe anything, what’s hilarious is that he’s now throwing the house GOP under the bus by turning around (because Laura Loomer says so) saying that he never actually wanted any Medicaid cuts!

What if the bill included ice cream on Tuesdays and everyone gets a unicorn. That's as likely as this mess you've just concocted. Republicans aren't in it to help people.,apwillis,2025-05-09T22:32:54,3

My point is that democrats would vote against any bill regardless if that bill is to the benefit of the American people as the alternate of the bill passing would mean the biggest take hike in American history and that works to their advantage politically.
