"Well, if he doesn't do what he promised, and doesn't immediately write the rules in the fashion he said he would, then he would likely find the 20 holdouts will go right back to holding out as soon as the House does anything. The thing preventing McCarthy from reneging is that he has to get their votes in order to effectively govern. This is why a short-term deal with the Dems to resolve the Speaker crisis wasn't going to work. Electing a Speaker isn't just about getting a guy in the seat, it's about determining a governing majority that can carry a majority of votes most of the time, and basically of the time on very routine issues. McCarthy lying and just doing what he wants would end his governing majority AND end his chances of ever getting it back.",mormagils,2023-01-09T08:50:22,4
"IMO of the deals McCarthy made reducing the number of votes needed for a motion to vacate seems to be the biggest factor weighing on him. If he chooses to not abide by the other deals he made they can call a vote to remove him. TBH, I am not sure what happens at that point. Is there a vote to remove him? Is that the whole house (D's and R's)? Does the Freedom Caucus have the votes for someone of their ranks to take over?   All of those questions aside, I think that's the one that will keep him in check. If he does *anything* the FC doesn't like, he's staring down the barrel of being removed as speaker.",Pork-Pond-Gazette,2023-01-09T13:02:18,2
"They have to vote on the rules themselves, in the same up or down way they voted in McCarthy.  If the Freedom Caucus doesn’t like the new rules, they’re not going to pass.",pluralofjackinthebox,2023-01-09T21:26:24,2
"I mean, they want to get rid of the entire federal government in the first place, you think their word matters?",Curleysound,2023-01-10T18:38:19,2
