"too late now. Europe has lost trust in the us government.   that happened when 'ukraine apparently started the war' (never mind the sudden expansionism regarding canada and greenland)   as a European: you do not stab friends in the back, and that is precisely what has happened.  free trade or not, we are boycotting usa products now, especially those from the red states.  not only items made there, but also made in europe but in ownerships by US companies (eg mondelez, kraft, heinz, etc).",jakedublin,2025-04-05T16:19:53,13
"I suspect there is going to be, essentially, a zero-tariff solution, no matter what the Orange One wants.    Either the tariffs will be walked back, and something like free trade will be the new environment.  Or, trade will basically stop.   Even a 1000% tariff on $0 (ZERO) product value, is still zero-tariff.",Natoochtoniket,2025-04-05T15:56:02,7

"Idiot Trump has proven himself once again as a faithless negotiator. His word means nothing. His statements and declarations are lies. His ""tariffs"" are absurd.   If $600 billion revenue annually is on the table for a tiny fraction of ""free trade"" then he is intentionally screwing the American people over by letting all those ""other countries keep their tariff money"" (even though ultimately in fact the American consumer pays the tariff cost as it is added to the price of the imported product).  If this is ""stable genius"" I got some ""gaslight"" you need to take a look at. Kellyanne? Kellyanne Con Way? You still there?",YallerDawg,2025-04-05T16:38:21,4

"The EU immediately opened up dialogue with Beijing the day after Liberation Day.  So did South Korea and Japan.  Not saying they are going all-in with China, but definitely looking for alternatives to the U.S.  Hopefully they expand trade with Canada and Mexico.",crucial_geek,2025-04-05T17:14:46,2

Canada? I don't think US products will sell well in Canada in many many years. This so called President has killed trust in all the Western countries except Russia. This is not about governments anymore. People choose what to purchase and there is a huge boycott for US products and services.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-04-05T18:03:46,1
"They will also be worried that China may try to dump their excess capacity, which had been going to the US, in Europe.  It makes sense to bring them in talk about that, and trade in general, since Trump's dumbest trade war will shake many things up.",MyStoopidStuff,2025-04-06T05:51:04,1
"mind you, this is not an Anti-America, but more a Protect Our Own Markets kind of thing... when a more liberal government returns in the US, i am sure the old pro-usa sentiment will also return, though we will have to remain vigilant with respect to the us government.   we know the vast majority of Americans are good people, who would like to have allies instead of enemies.  but sure, we will be investing more in our defensive capabilities, just like the American government wants (and i think they are right to), but these capabilities will not be supplied by American factories.",jakedublin,2025-04-06T08:16:27,1
"Hahaha, no.  I meant that it would be funny if the EU increased trade with Canada and Mexico.",crucial_geek,2025-04-05T19:54:37,3
Oh. Well EU signed an agreement with MERCOSUR last year. Canada is knocking the door after the tariffs and Mexico has always been a EU partner for certain products. The prices US pays for fruit and vegetables are almost double of what most Europeans countries pay. I was involved in international trade for 17 years and US has always been the most important market because they are willing to pay more. For example a bag of coffee in Spain will cost you 1.50 euros in any supermarket. The same bag in Walmart USA will cost you $6. I'm talking about the exact same product. There is a nonsense abput how much Americans are willing to pay for products.,Interesting-Ask9935,2025-04-05T20:12:59,2
