The people who hate him won!  This guy has an IQ lower than his age.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-04T13:20:42,75
"Narcissism can be funny, as we can see here. Since that condition doesn't allow the person to admit when they're wrong, they twist the narrative into something that only makes sense in their own demented, unwell mind. There's no objective reason why he should like this outcome.   Normal people look at him and just shake their heads in  confusion and or disgust - or commonly both.",IpeeEhh_Phanatic,2025-05-04T13:31:13,26
"Trump is the epitome of Oscar Wilde's famous line, at least the second part: ""There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.""  He needs to be the center of attention, even if that attention is for his bad behavior.",travio,2025-05-04T13:31:24,12
Only thing Canada agrees with him on. Thanks Trump! Guess he’ll be thanking Aussies next.,__dilligaf__,2025-05-04T13:33:45,9
does he know that the liberal party's colour in Canada is red or is the dementia really getting to him?,monosuperboss1,2025-05-04T13:30:31,12
"Remember: TRUMP WANTS AN EXCUSE TO INVADE CANADA. This is the real reason he’s pleased, a liberal win solidifies Canada as his enemy.",Vegetable-Mention140,2025-05-04T13:38:27,11
A satirical website couldn’t have come up with some of these quotes. This man has dementia and we are suffering for it.,Thin_Ad_2046,2025-05-04T13:39:12,5
"my first reaction: is he... stupid? then i realized, of course, it's Trump! malice and buffoonery all in one. not much smartz, tho.",belisario262,2025-05-04T13:40:06,5
">he seemed positively delighted at what he saw as the outsized influence he had in another country’s elections.  An entire country noticed him, that is what is important to him, being noticed.",PaleBlueDave,2025-05-04T14:04:31,5
"“I planned it that way.”  If he’s asked, he’ll say that it was his ‘plan all along’ for everybody in Australia to vote against the party most likely to be friendly to him, too.",AINonsense,2025-05-04T14:16:55,5
"“Frankly, Canada should thank me. Their elections were getting boring—too much politeness, not enough drama. Trump brought the ratings, the chaos, the excitement. Great television.”",TubeframeMR2,2025-05-04T13:30:43,5
This is a troll thing. It's a very popular technique within the Republican party.,localistand,2025-05-04T13:36:03,4
"The presumptive future prime minister that was leader of the Conservative Party not only lost, but lost his seat entirely. Largely due to trump. Trump is next level delusional",throwaway150996,2025-05-04T14:13:51,5
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but his preferred party lost and their leader lost his seat. How is this a win?",NotAKentishMan,2025-05-04T15:43:22,5
He honestly doesn't understand the world AT ALL.  He's just basking in power.,StronglyHeldOpinions,2025-05-04T13:48:50,2
This is weaponized fragility.,orcinyadders,2025-05-04T16:15:40,2
He is such a liar. You can trust everything trump says to be the opposite of what it true.,beadzy,2025-05-04T18:05:10,1
So he is “delighted” that a very well educated and very well connected prime minister now leads Canada. Trump is an idiot.,Jooodas,2025-05-04T22:09:10,1
This is exactly what most Americans want. That's why they voted for him to invade you guys.,Illustrious-Plan1427,2025-05-05T02:49:37,1
The media needs to stop entertaining the spin they put on everything. They will bend over backward to make anything bad for them be a positive.,hmr0987,2025-05-04T13:55:25,1
"Everybody hates me, but they're thinking about me, so that's a win!",bythebrook88,2025-05-04T19:22:00,0
He just has that much of an ego that anything about him makes him happy,Lunchb0xx87,2025-05-04T13:26:50,30
I think people on the Right severely underestimate the degree to which Trump only cares about Trump.   If he doesn’t run in 2028 he’s absolutely going to undermine the candidate and gleefully declare that Republicans can’t win without him.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-04T13:38:44,21
"Fortunately, the [guy who won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Carney) studied at Harvard (on a scholarship) and has a PhD in Economics from Oxford.   He is most definitely many times smarter than Trump is on his best day.  I'm actually optimistic for Canada.    Trump should be fucking terrified.",Mutex70,2025-05-04T18:03:25,4
"Same thing happened in Australia. He lined up with the winner (not the guy he would have supported) and said he’d never heard of the loser. The one who said he’d be just like Trump. That one. Yes, him. The one who lost his own seat after going all in on Trump.",Lucky-Roy,2025-05-04T22:00:33,3
"He’s commenting more on the fact that he had any influence on the election, not so much the who.",AreYouPurple,2025-05-04T13:33:13,6
Could’ve said that in 1986.,falsekoala,2025-05-04T16:03:43,2
"There's another trait with narcissistic personality disorder: nothing matters but the attention they receive, and they'll do just about anything to get it whether it's perceived negative or positive.",biscuitarse,2025-05-04T16:56:17,5
Their election is already over.  He didn't have time.,Postom,2025-05-04T13:48:53,3
"It's not dementia.  I'm sure he does have general cognitive decline, but his behavior is more consistent with narcissistic personality disorder.",725Cali,2025-05-04T14:09:32,8
The US is the only country where the liberal color is blue. A direct result of the 2000 election.,Internal_Swing_2743,2025-05-04T13:41:51,-1
"Just remember, in war we don't know what the  Geneva suggestions are.",Street_Anon,2025-05-04T13:43:35,15
"If my experience of dementia is in any way indicative, the confusion that arises generally takes the form of forgetting things.  Forgetting the conversation you had two minutes ago and repeating it.  Forgetting your brother died last month and you went to the funeral (and asking your nephew how their father is because you haven't heard from him lately...).  Just inventing stupid stuff because it suits your version of reality better isn't really on the menu.",jimicus,2025-05-04T14:13:47,3
What a tosser he is.,Optimal_Egg_9262,2025-05-04T14:14:07,3
It’s now the party of 4chan,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-04T13:49:35,3
So he can paint bad Canadian liberals as leeching suckers allied with China and European communists. Thats a pretext to invade.,Dunkleosteus666,2025-05-04T16:57:54,3
"Maybe he’s loosing his marbles, bc this makes zero sense. His guy got whacked bc Canadians hate his useless ass. And he’s thrilled?",2-wheels,2025-05-04T20:28:32,1
Just like a toddler acting out for attention.,seven_corpse_dinner,2025-05-04T13:43:00,11
He would have claimed the win either way. He paved the way for a sycophantic doofus to be bounced from his own seat and ushered in a true adversary that is savvy and politically astute. Big win for Team Trump!,jonnycanuck67,2025-05-04T13:50:01,3
"Yes, Albanese was elected Prime Minister,  (largely seen as a rebuke of Trump)",__dilligaf__,2025-05-04T14:54:56,2
"What's a ""Geneva""?  /s    He is welcome to try, at his earliest convenience.  Though, I suspect he is fine to leave that alone now, considering the relationship Russia needed to break, has been broken.",Postom,2025-05-04T13:46:49,3
"This is why I don't buy the ""he has dementia"" stuff everyone keeps saying. yeah he's slower and stuff but he was never all that smart and never a very elegant speaker.  He was always brash with a limited vocabulary",coatofforearm,2025-05-04T14:20:31,3
No point in looking for sanity where there is none!,NotAKentishMan,2025-05-04T20:47:08,1
"Like that jerk Matty that I went to kindergarten with who would poop himself on purpose and eat worms for the attention? He got pulled out of school half way through the year and didn't see him again until third grade, no clue if he still liked poop based attention.",barontaint,2025-05-04T13:55:10,1
And Dutton lost his seat - just like in Canada.   Thank you Trump!!,FoatyMcFoatBase,2025-05-04T17:02:24,4
"You think Russians are bad? Nah, just piss Canadians off. The White House may re modelling ",Street_Anon,2025-05-04T14:08:13,3
"Not to mention - people have been saying ""he has dementia"" since Covid, if not before.  That's over five years ago.    If the dementia diagnosis was accurate - and it followed a regular progression - by now it'd be completely impossible to hide.",jimicus,2025-05-04T14:30:03,2
Another fresh coat of paint?  Maybe the Treasury too?  Why stop there?,Postom,2025-05-04T14:09:15,1
