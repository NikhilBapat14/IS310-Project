This genX had no difficulty at all learning about the path we are on.  I've hated Trump since the 80s.  I've despised right wing media since the 90s.  I've despised republicans at least since Bush.  Prior I mostly shook my head and disagreed.  Now I full on hate their regressive selfish and short sighted political goals.  This isn't a generational issue.  It's an educational issue.,ms_moogy,2025-04-28T12:36:47,78

"Eh  As someone who leans way left and has plenty to find fault with the DNC, the Biden administration accomplished far more than they were given credit for and Manchin/Sinema were essentially the Lieberman of the tenure who prevented more progress.   There was student loan forgiveness for over 5 million Americans. This helped working people (albeit not me) a great deal. This would have gone further if Republican thinks tanks didn't challenge it in court. The infrastructure deal as well as the CHIPS and Science Act will help working people in this country in a multitude of ways that we will see take place in the next couple of decades. Its just not a snap of the finger fix. He armed the IRS with the resources and manpower to actually investigate the ultra wealthy, which was slated to bring in over 120 billion in tax revenue over the next decade. There was a child tax credit that helped working families lies until a couple of dip shit Democrats and Republicans ruined it. He capped the cost of prescription drugs for seniors on Medicare as well as how much some specific drugs can cost. He crossed the picket line for union workers  The administration while not perfect honestly did more for working people than any other administration in my lifetime and signed some of the most significant bills this century outside of the ACA.   They were just so fucking bad at messaging and calling bullshit kn republicans as well as Manchin/Sinema . I'm not saying the administration was perfect by any means but he did a lot of what he proposed.   And I'm not blaming one group of voters over another. People didn't vote. People of all ages had ample time to do actual research on what accomplishments each candidate has had, which one is a fucking felon who stiffs working people, who is an actual racist, etc and either stayed at home or didn't bother. The party also sucked at messaging. I also think COVID fucked with what people retained and didn't retain. There is plenty of blame to go aroundand some as much of it is on voters for not educating themselves as it is the DNC for continuing to shoot themselves in the dick",rounder55,2025-04-28T13:17:36,27
