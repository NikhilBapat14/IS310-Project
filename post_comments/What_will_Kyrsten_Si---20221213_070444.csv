"It won’t.  For one, everyone saying this will “split the vote” has to remember that she can’t just hop on the ballot in Arizona as an independent. She would first need 42,000 signatures from independent voters, meaning they can’t be registered Democrat or Republican and that would be REALLY hard to get done without efficient campaign infrastructure that she doesn’t currently have without the Dems. And it would put a huge dent in whatever campaign funds she’ll have on hand. It’s moot anyways.   She knows that she has no chances of winning Arizona as an independent or democrat. She’s doing this because she wants to be the center of attention and have the media discussing if she’s going to run or not while she heads to a nice corporate job after her term expires.",Gryffindorcommoner,2022-12-14T07:59:47,6
"Sinema's political career is dead. She is a first-time Senator that ran on being a committed if moderate liberal Dem, and her voters that put her in office expected a policy platform along those lines, and in fairness that IS what she committed to. Over the course of her term, she has directly contradicted those promises about as explicitly as is possible...and it hasn't gained her any friends.  Sinema has something like 80% of AZ Dems disapproving of her. That's INSANE. She's a little better with independents, but still heavily unfavorable, in large part because literally she's only had one platform and it was all lies. Her highest approval rating might actually be with Reps...but of course they still very much disapprove of her because she's basically a Dem, just a sucky one. Sinema literally has no friends whatsoever left in AZ politics.   So then why leave the party? The main thing here is that she's still got a good portion of her term left, and there's absolutely no hope of her ever making amends with the Dems. She simply cannot ever be trusted again. So her only hope, even if it's a very faint one, is to pivot to an independent candidate that can do a Murkowski-style approach.  But it won't work. The problem here is that Sinema's base of support, her path to victory, was never one that relied heavily on independent voters. Again, she ran as a committed Dem, and so her whole electoral infrastructure was structured around that constituency...and they now aggressively hate her. She's trying to pivot to an entirely new group of voters, with less than a full election cycle to go, while hoping that new group of voters doesn't notice that she royally screwed over her last group of voters. Murkowski or Angus King are folks who *always* were leaning heavily on independent and very moderate voters, so when they didn't really have an explicit home in the party they caucus with, who cared? That was already part of the appeal. It was a feature. But with Sinema, it's a bug.   So Sinema was almost certainly not going to get the Dem nomination next time, and now that she's left the party it cements it. She's also not going to siphon off Dem voters because they absolutely hate her and with good reason. She's also gong to have a tough time getting independent voters because polls already are showing she's MASSIVELY underwater with them.  The most likely situation is that the Dems nominate someone new, and because the Dems are so betrayed by Sinema, Sinema can't split their vote. This means she'll be competing for independent voters with a likely somewhat moderate Dem, and maybe even will siphon off a few Rep voters that prefer her over a MAGA candidate like Lake or Masters. In short, Sinema leaving the Dems gives the Dems a pretty noticeable leg up when her seat is up for re-election.",mormagils,2022-12-14T09:02:53,3
"More appeal for historic republicans who dislike MAGA, but don't want to vote for a Dem. Criticism that she is betraying the party are now meaningless. Puts a massive dent into the Dem's plan to get rid of the ~~House~~ filibuster, which furthers her appeal with moderate republicans. As far as I can tell, Dems don't have someone who could beat her.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-13T20:01:29,5
It won't work to her advantage except to get news coverage. In 2024 she will assure that the Democrat vote is split and elect a Republican.,StedeBonnet1,2022-12-14T06:29:36,1
I appreciate your insight but think you are mistaken on her ever being a committed Dem. It is also untrue that she never relied heavily on independent voters.  That is who she was.  She was always an Independent when she worked at the state legislature in AZ. She also is part of mostly centrist coalitions since becoming a US Senator.   It really is a shame though that because she voted for what she believed her constituents wanted or needed that she has been backlisted by her party.   I wish more politicians were like her and  didn’t vote solely based on what the party line is.,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-11-03T21:01:34,0
"But if she caucuses with the Democrats, won’t that keep almost all of the never-MAGA Republicans from voting for her anyway? It seems like a cynical move to split Democratic votes to me. The reasoning is beyond my comprehension though.",[deleted],2022-12-13T23:50:06,1

If she can get on the ballot.,LiberalAspergers,2022-12-15T16:37:26,1
"I said she _ran_ on being a committed Dem but I agree she probably never was one.   She lied to her constituents is what she did. That's not virtuous. There's nothing wrong with being a centrist, but she absolutely misrepresented herself before her voters and that is deeply worthy of criticism.  Also, voting along the party line is virtuous _if you're a part of that party_. The party line is defined by what your constituents want, so focusing on the party line is a way of justifying your constituents' asks.  The sorry line isn't inherently a bad thing. It's literally the thing you've promised to your constituents.",mormagils,2023-11-03T21:18:42,1
"I assume that she realizes that there is no way to remain in office in 2024 and beyond, but this is a way to raise some money are run one more campaign, which is good for a few million dollars diverted to her pockets, and makes her a more interesting figure for future talking head jobs.",LiberalAspergers,2022-12-14T05:38:23,7
She only pledged to remain within party lines until the election and probably thinks that she has already lost the progressive branch of the Dem party. Will come down to her campaign.,Original-Aerie8,2022-12-14T07:31:20,1
Explain to me how she ran on being a committed Democrat and what this even means?  She was my local representative for a number of years.  She has always considered herself more bipartisan and conducted herself as such as an AZ politician. I believe that is part of the reason that she was elected as a senator in this state following years of Republican senators before her .  She could work with both sides. Which illogically seems to be such a sin for some out there…,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-11-03T21:34:01,1
Question regarding your statement: Do you believe that everyone in Washington should vote based on their party line?  Isn't that part of the problem and gridlock that frustrates many voters?,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-11-29T11:32:14,1
"That’s kind of what I suspected. But now that she’ll be (let’s assume) running as an independent, doesn’t that mean that…  a) If a Democrat also runs in 2024, that poses the risk of ensuring a Republican gets the seat because of votes split between the Democrat and the Independent.  b) If a Democrat doesn’t run, that she’ll lose to a Republican anyway because few people really like her.   It just seems like going Independent is such a calculated, cynical, and self-serving move in her case.",[deleted],2022-12-14T06:16:39,3
"Cool. You're only looking at part of the information. When she ran for Senate, she did so on the Dem ticket and endorsed standard Dem policies. That was her own words. She was successful in part _because_ she appeared to shift into a more mainline Dem platform which is why a lot of mainline Dems supported her run that otherwise they wouldn't have.   Joe Biden also can work with both sides and is bipartisan, but he's also a standard, if moderate, Dem. Sinema appeared to be shifting to this kind of model, and then pulled back when it mattered most. She lied to her voters, and they're episodes for good reason.",mormagils,2023-11-03T21:37:58,1
"Not voting the party line is just fine. Misrepresenting your policy views to voters and then claiming you're just not always voting the party line to avoid gridlock is not fine. If Sinema was honest about who she was from the get go, and then proceeded to be this person, then I wouldn't be so critical of her. She might not have gotten elected...but that's how the system is supposed to work.",mormagils,2023-11-29T12:56:36,1
"Her only chance of.holding the seat is for the Democrats to decide the seat is lost and not put resources into it, in which case she might be able to win in a 3 way race, as Democratic voters might choose her if they think the D has no chance.  I suspect the party will decide making an example is worth losing the seat and put resources behind their nominee even though it is likely a hopeless task.  The hard part for her will be getting on the ballot. Arizona requires 45,000 signatures of registered independent voters to get on a Senare ballot as an independent. If you are registered as Democrat, Republican, Green, Libertarian, etc, you can't sign her list. No sure she can pull it off.",LiberalAspergers,2022-12-14T22:37:18,2
Interesting argument.  I will take the bait.  Can you tell me exactly where she lied to her voters?  I am not saying it didn't happen.  I am just not up to date on why Sinema is no longer in the party's favor.,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-11-29T11:29:11,1
Do you live in AZ? Because if you do you should know that she has always been an independent.  She probably joined one of the uniparty sides simply for funding her campaign.,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-12-06T01:06:18,1
"Here's an article that does a decent job discussing how she very much was not selling herself as a conservative Dem when she first ran for the Senate: [https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kyrsten-sinema-conservative-democrat/](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/kyrsten-sinema-conservative-democrat/)  Here's another policy summary that was from her candidacy for the Senate. She's clearly a rank-and-file Dem according to these values and during her time in the Senate she's opposed several of these things that she said she supported: [https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/28338/kyrsten-sinema](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/28338/kyrsten-sinema)  It's true that Sinema went from being a far-left activist to a more moderate/centrist Dem position, but she was still clearly within the Dem policy agenda. And in a tenure that saw *major* threats to the Dem agenda such as Dobbs, undermining of fair and free elections, and increased abuse of the filibuster. So it's fair I guess to say that Sinema wasn't exactly asked in 2018 if she would have to fight Reps this hard on very basic assumed rights...but also every other moderate/centrist Dem wasn't either and they responded by cleaving towards the Dem party values on these issues.  Here's another article discussing it: [https://www.vox.com/2022/1/23/22897566/kyrsten-sinema-voting-rights-filibuster-backlash-censure](https://www.vox.com/2022/1/23/22897566/kyrsten-sinema-voting-rights-filibuster-backlash-censure)  There's no doubt that Sinema was angling toward centrism in 2018. But she was angling toward being a centrist *Democrat*, which would put her in roughly the same mold as Joe Biden. Instead she's been one of his biggest detractors.",mormagils,2023-11-29T12:54:10,1
"When you're ready to have an adult conversation on the topic, I'll be happy to do so. But using silly words like ""uniparty sides"" and ignoring her own written words on policy matters is not having an adult conversation.",mormagils,2023-12-06T01:18:23,1
Interesting comments however it is hard to see your side of things when you are posting from very left publications.  Perhaps take a look at an AZ Republic article posted about this.  This is the biggest publication in the state if AZ and could fly in the face of your argument that she is so disappointing to the voters in the state.  https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2022/12/13/kyrsten-sinema-right-political-parties-broken/69722217007/,Potential-Alarm-2716,2023-12-06T01:04:21,1

"Lol, are you serious? You're suggesting that my multiple sources are invalid because they're too far left and you're instead coming back at me with an op ed?  This doesn't even address the point. Sinema absolutely was a far left activist early on in her career, and I acknowledge that she chose to pursue a more moderate path during her time in the Dem party. But you're ignoring that she made specific policy commitments to the Dem agenda that she then went back on once she was elected.   I mean, dude, the justfacts website is literally quoting her own policy writing from her own website. You can't call that ""far left"" and then also tell me that Sinema is a centrist.

"I wouldn't say I am a democrat, but I would say that my voting preferences very clearly line up with the democratic party's platform and it's not particularly close. Basically, it's not that I woke up one morning and picked out the Dems, it's that over the course of learning all I have about the political system, the Dems became a pretty clear choice for me.  As for how I got that way, well, I've studied history. I've read high quality secondary sources that have done deep dives into policy and examined what works and what doesn't. And the results are pretty one sided at this point.  We know supply side economics has largely failed. Reagan's whole economic basis hasn't worked. When it comes to gun policy, the evidence is overwhelming that arming teachers and security guards doesn't work and gun control does. Social democracy has some pretty incredible results. The ""welfare state"" despite having a derogatory connotation has been a huge boon to millions of Americans. Higher taxes, well spent, tend to have pretty good outcomes. These are all basic ideas that a student of history can pretty easily see with just a little bit of effort...and they're all things that are pretty hostile to the current Rep platform. We haven't even gotten started on things like foreign policy.  I've been studying for a long time. My undergrad ended about 10 years ago, and I still read history books when I can, while also keeping up to date in current events. This is a VERY broad question and maybe you're better off asking about certain specific issues or topics if you want more detailed information.   It's not about me thinking about the government like a vending machine and the Dems have been giving me more of the candy I like. It's about the fact that when I learn more deeply about issues and policies and concepts, the answers the Dems give are generally of higher quality and more accurate than the answers the Reps give, at least in the current iteration of the two parties.",mormagils,2024-03-11T11:25:23,1
"I appreciate you laying out some of the findings of your research.  It is clear you are well-read and versed on many of the issues.  You have given me some things to ponder...   A couple of things stood out to me that I would love you to elaborate on:   1. Higher taxes, well spent, tend to have pretty good outcomes.    The key here is ""well spent"".  Don't you find that the government does a pretty good job of not spending money very well?   Just look at the current federal deficit.    2. Dems answers are of higher quality and more accurate than the answers of Reps-paraphrasing here sorry.   Can you give me some more context around this?  I would disagree with this in general-but I am sure you can find one-off examples to make this point.    1. Do you have any issues with the ""left"" owning many of the major media corporations, or the blatant hypocrisy of the both parties but more commonly exemplified by the left leaners (immigration, using the DOJ as a means to silence your political opposition to name a few)?",Potential-Alarm-2716,2024-03-13T15:09:16,1
"1. There being a deficit doesn't mean taxes aren't well spent. It just means we're choosing to spend a lot of money, but the way we determine if it's well spent or not is by evaluating how well the issues that money is spent on are addressed. And by this standard, taxes are VERY well spent.  Plain and simple, when the federal government gets involved in stuff, it tends to improve. This isn't true just for taxes--the Civil Rights Movement was notable because the federal government finally addressed inequalities. Child labor was an issue until the *federal* government solved it. Pay discrimination against women was directly solved via legislation. Federal regulatory agencies are effective in keeping our food, medicines, etc safe.   Let's look at the social safety net. I was just last year the NYT ran an article on how the US has made huge strides in addressing child poverty and that is directly attributable to the social safety net. It's an easy good search if you want more details. Social Security is tax money that greatly improved American economic security. Welfare, Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, Pell Grants...you name it, these are things that are vital to improving the issues they're looking to address.   Of course, not every single thing the government does turns to gold. Duh. But in basically every single history book I've ever read, you could accurately sum up the situation by ""the situation was bad because bad actors exploited lax existing law and then things got better once we passed a federal law."" That's the basic thesis of damn near 100% of the US history books I've ever read. This is especially true in issues of no previous federal laws and only having state authority.  2. Let's focus on foreign policy for a minute. The way JFK handled the Cuban Missile Crisis is peerless and to this day stands out as one of the best processes for foreign policy we've ever seen. *One Hell of a Gamble* by Naftali and Fursenko goes into this in great detail. Some of our worst foreign policy failures have been from ignorant and ideological approaches we've seen primarily from Republicans. Read *For the Soul of Mankind* by Leffler to see a scathing criticism of Reagan's approach to the Cold War, though Leffler does acknowledge that once Reagan actually put in some effort to learn a bit more, he started to adopt policies more in line with his predecessors and gives him a great deal of credit after that shift.  This is hardly unusual. *The Second Fouding* by Foner and a host of other works makes quite clear that if American history has villains, it's the Southern conservatives. *Breaking the Two Party Doom Loop* by Drutman sees similar conclusions from a very different issue.   Again, I'm not saying every Dem platform is perfect in every way. Of course there are some misses on specific issues. But in general, the way the Dems overall have their approach to government is supported by data wildly moreso than the basic premises of the Rep platform.   3. I'm not a fan of America's corporatism, but that's also an issue that's so far on the wrong side at the moment that I'm way more focused on other stuff. There's a lot of stuff the US CAN do effectively now...if we simply choose to.   I don't really agree that the ""left"" is using the DOJ to silence political opposition. If anything, I think the DOJ has been too timid in pursuing violations of law out of a misguided fear of appearing too partisan. I also don't really think I agree with your connecting immigration with hypocrisy. I don't know what you mean by that.",mormagils,2024-03-13T19:17:53,1
