Isn’t the Pope supposed to be God’s representative on earth? I think the Catholic Church would change the headline to: “Trump administration disagrees with God”,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-08T20:29:33,13

"The Pope is the sovereign of his own nation, Vatican City, and the spiritual leader of 1.4 billion Catholics.  That he was an American is mostly irrelevant now.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-08T20:35:50,13

"How much the new Pope is a North American can be seen in his second nationality, which he chose in full consciousness. He gave his inaugural speech as Pope in Italian and his second mother tongue Spanish. English? Nothing. From this point of view, finally something good is coming out of the USA after Trump.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-09T02:30:19,3
