When the US manages to make China look reasonable to a nation like Canada then we've become the asshole of the world.,jnwbman,2025-04-24T09:16:24,58
Donald Trump can claim he was right. China is negotiating. Just not with us.,Deinosoar,2025-04-24T09:19:00,9

"Not against America, but against global authoritarianism and ethno-religious fascism as led by America.  I know, China...  You gotta take the allies who are around when you can.  Maybe this leads to more freedom for the Chinese people.  Either way, trump and Putin and Orban and Lukashenko and their like are far greater threats to world peace at this moment than China is.",rogozh1n,2025-04-24T09:19:49,5
"Had Trump wanted a trade war with China, a well-managed approach would've been to gather US allies first in order to isolate China and protect US trading interests.  As done, we've pissed off the entire planet and isolated ourselves.  Even for those who think a trade war with China was a good idea, this regime displays their incompetence time and time again.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T09:23:04,4

I wonder if Trump next move will be to â€œnegotiate â€œ US will drop all his tariffs if Canada also applies the same tariffs vs China.,New-Ad-9450,2025-04-24T11:15:35,3

"Dear China,  The reason you aren't getting an answer is because all of our politicians are waiting for the election to do anything divisive in the course of leading the country.  Our main concern isn't tariffs, it's definitely human rights and the threats to our country that Trump has made.  The fact China has been constantly threatening to invade Taiwan has always made it feel like China is going to be just another empire and is the real reason most people haven't supported you.  For the same reason, everyone is suddenly abandoning America.  The elegance of the American system was that they conceded hard power and a handful of services to attain soft power and broad support from roughly half the world.  Something some idiot was recently too stupid to comprehend.  We're all wary but hopeful China is willing to do the same.",Somecrazycanuck,2025-04-27T09:23:23,1
"Oh my God, the USA needs to understand that not everything is *about them*.

Canada and China have diplomatic ties dating back to the rise of industrialized China.   The United States needs to understand that this is a them problem. The rest of the world wasn't running everything through the US. We have our own priorities, our own relationships, and frankly it's pleasant to know that we're dealing with adults who can think more than eight seconds into the future.",silicondali,2025-04-24T10:31:02,15
"China has been reasonable and reliable for ages now   Theyâ€™re just not nice. Like, at all. The U.S. kind of was nice, sometimes, to white countries, and it had a lot of historical banked goodwill. Most of all it had clever diplomats and officials who deliberately wound the U.S. into as many situations as possible to extend hegemony and preserve American primacy.   While it was reasonable and reliable as well that made everything fine and the U.S. the obvious partner. However it turns out that by far the most important things  of all those attributes are reasonable and reliable. All the other shit means nothing without those two, and Trump took both off the table, then smashed the table, then tried to eat the table to establish dominance.   So now China looks like a much better option. They might be kind of assholes, but they will honour a contract.",Drolb,2025-04-24T09:45:47,23

"Sometimes you need to separate politics and business.   Canada needs business much more than they need politics right now. Historically we've always benefited from good decisions of the US when they were positive and we've been punished when the US decisions have been negative.   I really do think it's a good time for Canada to ensure that our sovereignty is not related to America  If we have to make a decision between two  countries led by dictators, my money is on China. They have much better stuff.",HerpesIsItchy,2025-04-24T09:59:02,4
This leads to less of anything the Chinese government doesnâ€™t want because theyâ€™re winning. You donâ€™t change when youâ€™re winning.,Drolb,2025-04-24T09:49:16,1
"You forgot the further tariff and annexation threats Formosa the White House yesterday, at this point while I do know the enemy of my enemy is not my crime, but at least they can be a reasonable trading partner.  China while actively interfering with our elections is not actively threatening Canada, so we will take what we can get",thefrail158,2025-04-24T09:58:23,4
"I think it would be more accurate to say that Vladimir Putin is playing Donald Trump like a fiddle.   China is just taking advantage of it.  I've been paying a lot of attention to the Ukraine, Russia war. Donald Trump is negotiating on Twitter.

"Nah, you're glossing over our ""golden"" period from 1902-1949.  We started slipping when we allowed our love for oil dominate our relationship with the Middle East and cozied up to too many strongmen during the Cold War.  World War II, the Marshall Plan and perhaps even NATO were our high point internationally.  But we have a long and dismal record in Central and South America not to mention Southeast Asia.  Our tacit support for dictatorships across the world is shameful and directly led to such anti-American rancor across the third world.  Our biggest saving grace has always been that the former Soviet Union was a  worse alternative (culturally, economically, politically) for most countries except for Cuba, North Korea, Iran and certain African nations.  I don't include the Eastern bloc which was under the yoke of Soviet hegemony.  Even there, those nations with enough remove have turned their eyes westward.",jnwbman,2025-04-24T09:46:24,8

"> I don't include the Eastern bloc which was under the yoke of Soviet hegemony.   As someone from Eastern bloc - correction: ""which was SOLD to Soviets by USA"".
