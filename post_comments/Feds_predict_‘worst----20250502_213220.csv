So basically Canada's liberal government is admitting that they can't win a trade war...,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-02T23:28:58,35
All canada has to do is work with america. Instead they want to look big and tough. At least mexico got the right idea.,Jurclassic5,2025-05-03T01:21:50,24

"Oh they are completely fucked, carney is as close to a ccp plant as you can get without litterally being one. Even if not for the tarrifs he wanted to buddy up to china more than any other western country.
