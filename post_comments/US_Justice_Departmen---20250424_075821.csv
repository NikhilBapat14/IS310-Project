"They are so dumb that I know they are doing this because the term civil rights is associated with the civil rights movement so it's ""DEI"".  Civil rights have nothing to do with race. Every single American has civil rights and they could be violated.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T09:25:24,7

They know their labeling of “DEI” is a farce. They don’t care. They want power for and privilege for white males.,justsomeguy73,2025-04-24T09:33:47,6
"I hear you. But, it's not only about ""race"" or DEI. Read the last quoted part...  (I know I'm echoing your point, but mine is that it goes beyond Trump wanting to shut down DEI efforts...)  >At least three senior career attorneys -- nonpolitical employees who typically remain in their jobs from administration to administration -- *who managed offices that investigated abuse by police and handled violations of voting and disability rights, have been ordered to take other assignments, said three of the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss moves that had not been made public.""*  Bottom line? Trump and his cabinet of deplorables and that includes Musk, don't care about anyone but themselves and their profits! I also posted an article about them firing a bunch of people who would investigate the reason why firefighters die....THIS administration has no shame!!",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-24T09:49:52,1
