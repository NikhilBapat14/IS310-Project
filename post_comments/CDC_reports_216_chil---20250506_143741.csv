Don't 99% of flu deaths come from unvaccinated,Faucet860,2025-05-06T14:43:07,32
Expect that to go up this year.,Skraelings,2025-05-06T16:04:26,6
Honestly surprised they have funds to track it.,sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-06T15:26:19,5

In 15 years? Hmmm‚Ä¶ which political party was in charge the four years leading up to the 2010 statistic‚Ä¶  It must be a coincidence that Republicans hit record numbers.,Sea_Site_4280,2025-05-06T18:45:55,3
This was the worst flu season ive ever experienced,LevelCandid764,2025-05-06T16:33:02,2
"If you choose not to vaccinate your kids, at least make sure you have medication and some [iHealth 3-in-1 test kits](https://ihealthlabs.com/collections/all/products/ihealth-covid-19-flu-a-b-antigen-rapid-home-test?variant=44690316755106&utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Derek&utm_campaign=3in1) at home just in case. The first 24 to 48 hours after symptoms appear is the best time to test and start treatment. Acting quickly can really make a difference in how fast and how well you recover.",lmgforwork,2025-05-06T22:03:41,1
Fun fact:  That is 21.6 times the number of trans athletes in college sports.,psychoholic,2025-05-07T06:06:36,1
80-85% of pediatric influenza deaths are in unvaccinated children.,2-travel-is-2-live,2025-05-06T15:10:35,19
"Vaccine rates are down but you also should take into account that the flu vaccine just isn't very good.  In the best years, it is only about 60% effective and usually hovers between 40-50%.  There have been some years where it has been a low as 20% effective.  Hopefully science is well on its way to developing a more effective vaccine for the flu.",[deleted],2025-05-06T14:53:24,6
"Thanks, antivaxxers. üôÑ",bakerfredricka,2025-05-06T16:34:27,5
"If they‚Äôd stop reporting on it, this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem! /s",ill0gitech,2025-05-06T16:28:22,5
"Isn't that mainly because the vaccine is based on last years flu, and it changes every year?",ianrl337,2025-05-06T14:58:35,8
"Saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot very good‚Äù is inaccurate. It is quite effective at fighting the strains it is designed to combat, its effectiveness falls because it‚Äôs difficult to predict what strains will be prevalent locally.  But even then, 40-50 percent is a great success rate when you consider reductions in communicability and the fact that lives are saved every year. Every person who is made immune is one less person who can infect others.",Moth-Lands,2025-05-06T16:41:01,5
And I assume this has nothing to do with Covid that harms your immune system. Absolutely nothing,finitefuck,2025-05-06T17:54:06,1
It's not based on last year. It travels across hemispheres and there's various strands. They are just guessing which will come.,Faucet860,2025-05-06T15:02:01,7
"They can only make so much. They usually try to bet on which two or three flu will be prevalent, and manufacture those strains. Sometimes the little flu wins over others.",davidkali,2025-05-06T15:57:03,3
"My understanding is that even though there are only four strains of influenza, there are thousands of subtypes and they can't possibly include anywhere close to all of them in the current vaccines so they have to make a best guess.  I've also read that the process of using eggs to grow the virus can cause them to mutate so even if you predicted the right stains, the vaccine would be less effective.",[deleted],2025-05-06T15:06:18,2
On the effectiveness rate I have a question. Does a 50% effectiveness rate equate to a 50% chance of me not dying if that strain made it everywhere?   I also thought that no matter what I would have some protection against the previous strains and related strains from other years.,lizard7709,2025-05-06T20:39:53,1
Lets not play semantics here.  The simple fact is that they assign an effectiveness rate to the vaccine after every flu season ends.  Those figures show that the vaccine is not very effective overall.,[deleted],2025-05-06T16:43:54,0
"No, it would mean the risk of getting sick/dying is 50% lower in vaccinated populations than in unvaccinated populations.   It would mean a 50% chance of not dying only if what is going around is 100% fatal.",tangerinelion,2025-05-06T21:09:00,3
"I can‚Äôt agree with that. There are vaccines for very specific diseases that DON‚ÄôT mutate much that are as or less effective and they are considered essential. If everyone were vaccinated for the flu, even at the lowest rate presented, deaths would fall dramatically.",Moth-Lands,2025-05-06T16:49:59,4
"Dude, you are literally trying to make up something to argue about that flies in the face of the data and is irrelevant to the point I made.    https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/php/effectiveness-studies/index.html",[deleted],2025-05-06T16:54:12,0
"I don‚Äôt think you understand what I‚Äôm saying. Even in a year where the effectiveness is low, the flu vaccine is still about as effective as vaccines used to fight deadly diseases in the early twentieth century. Vaccines that were considered groundbreaking and that saved thousands of lives.  If you consider that ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù well then I guess we just have a difference of perspective.  Also: I have a microbiology degree. You don‚Äôt need to lecture me on the stats.",Moth-Lands,2025-05-06T16:59:52,8
"The MMR vaccine is 97% effective so no, I don't consider 50% effective the best science can do.  Apparently the scientists agree with me since they are working on improved flu vaccines.",[deleted],2025-05-06T17:02:03,-1
"MMR vaccines are the most modern and effective vaccines to ever exist. Of course scientists are working on better vaccines, but the existing ones are still worth using and promoting.",Moth-Lands,2025-05-06T17:03:20,6
Not once did I say people shouldn't get a flu shot.  That doesn't change the fact that how effective any particular year is at combating the virus is going to play a role in how many people die from it.,[deleted],2025-05-06T17:05:22,0
