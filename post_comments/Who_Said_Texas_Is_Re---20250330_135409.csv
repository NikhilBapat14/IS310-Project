"Dallas, Houston, Austin, and most big cities tend to lean liberal and progressive.   Red states like Texas use gerrymandering and other extreme measures to politically choke and snuff out big cities from influencing state politics.   One thing which keeps Texas red for now is a huge influx of fanatical bitter MAGA transplants from other states who move to Texas because they view Texas as the red right-wing dreamland.

"Texas is not going to go blue anytime soon. We can bet on that. Florida is similar. There’s other states that are much much closer than those two, North Carolina for instance.

"Sadly, so many of their votes were suppressed.   I, too, was furious for the ones that what I thought ""chose to sit this one out.""  There's an enlightening article that no major network news, nor did any ""investigative"" reporter/journalist decided to look into just how successful voter suppression was, especially in TX, and other ""key"" states. (And no, it's not a ""trump/musk fixed the election  - we just don't know how"" article, I promise!!)  The actual numbers were well beyond staggering.

"> One thing which keeps Texas red for now is a huge influx of fanatical bitter MAGA transplants from other states who move to Texas because they view Texas as the red right-wing dreamland.  People tend to overlook this. The NYT did an article on polarization and found that some of the fastest growing states are attracting the most politically partisan transplants. It’s called “The Big Sort”.   Texas, Florida, Arizona, Idaho, Utah, Tennessee, and South Carolina are attracting conservatives while Georgia, Colorado, & Virginia are attracting liberals. North Carolina and Nevada were the only fast-growing states with an even mix of both.   Texas isn’t flipping anytime soon.",avalve,2025-03-30T15:50:37,15

"Probably because most Nevada transplants are from California ([almost 40%](https://stacker.com/stories/nevada/states-sending-most-people-nevada)). Ironically, these Californians are overwhelmingly conservative and have pushed Nevada from lean blue to purple in recent years. There were numerous articles on this last year because the same thing is happening in Arizona. It doesn’t take much to flip a state that only went for Biden by ~34k votes, which is exactly what ended up happening. [And Republicans then went on to overtake Democrats in total registrations in the state back in January](https://apnews.com/article/nevada-voter-registration-republicans-democrats-nonpartisans-efc238ee69e4f87e35bcbf00c606c21a).

"I live in California, and a lot of right wing fanatics from here also think that the red states are some kind of tax free, small government, libertarian wonderland of unicorns and cheap real estate. They sell off their basic three bedroom ranch home in So. Cal for a million, and move to Tennesse to buy a McMansion on 5 acres.

"Do you live there? I did, for 41 years. You may be grossly underestimating the level of voter disenfranchisement that happens there. Texas makes it as difficult as possible to exercise one’s right to vote, particularly if you are a POC. Even with the availability of two weeks of early voting, it still only occurs during certain hours. If you have a job (or two or three) and/or a family, finding the time to cast your ballot may literally be impossible, if you were able to jump the hurdles to become eligible to vote in the first place. I’m aware there’s a significant population of people nationwide who have checked out of the electoral process, but presuming Texas stays red because people don’t care is inaccurate. It stays red because the legislature and Texas’ congress critters work damn hard to make sure it stays that way.",foresthobbit13,2025-03-30T18:49:01,4

"No argument from me there. Lived in Austin for 30 years, long enough to watch it go from deep blue to a lighter blue surrounded by increasingly deep red. I think that very real threat of Texas turning blue is what caused Republicans to gerrymander the large cities even more ridiculously than they did in 2010. The state district map looked like someone had scribbled all over them with a Sharpie. I think my greater point is that the apparent lack of participation on the part of Texas progressives wasn’t willful, it was imposed by a variety of external factors largely engineered by Republicans, both at the state and federal level. They know perfectly well that if truly fair elections were held, they would lose in a heartbeat.",foresthobbit13,2025-03-30T21:54:16,3
