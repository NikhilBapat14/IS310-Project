That’s way too many people. The fact that even one person thinks he is focusing on the right thing is insane.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-26T14:21:57,38
So where are those half of republicans? The title should just read 50% are okay with these shit policies and the other 50% have lost their balls,Thund3rbolt,2025-04-26T14:25:05,11
"I live in the deep South, and I'm here to tell you that Republicans/MAGATS are simply not aware of everything Trump is doing. They're not hearing it, they watch Fox News 24/7 and do not hear 1/100th of what he does on a daily basis. If Trump is ever impeached, it's going to take a massive education campaign to explain to half the country why he was impeached. They won't get it.",Martin1015,2025-04-26T15:11:55,10
"MAGA is fine with getting rid of safe food, climate disaster relief, stable supply chain, medical research, weather services, funding for farmers, veterans funding, national parks, public lands, and due process. I have one question for MAGA "" Who or What is important ?""",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-26T16:21:08,1
So 50% of Republican voters think the President is currently focusing on the right priorities? OMG. And these people vote.,xibeno9261,2025-04-26T17:42:50,1
He’s focusing?,-ItsCasual-,2025-04-26T18:04:37,1
Which means no one in their fucking right mind believes he’s done anything worth fucking while,maybetryyourownanus,2025-04-26T20:13:38,1
"Sounds like 1/2 republicans are still delusional. Might take all four year for them to figure it out, if ever.",commanderclif,2025-04-26T21:01:31,1

"Friendly reminder that roughly 54% of Americans read *below* a sixth grade level. As in, they couldn't parse The Hunger Games if you paid them to try.  We're not a smart country, we just play one on tv.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-26T16:22:11,6
"I took a peek at the article. 54% are happy with him. It seems like people talking crazy, like saying they just like that he got into office and is actually doing things, even if they don't agree with some of those things. When stuff he does starts to negatively impact them, I supposed, that's when they'll change their tune. And trust me, it will start to negatively impact them.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-26T14:30:35,4
"We haven't even gotten to the real effects of what he's doing yet. Tornado season is still ramping up, we have wildfire and hurricane season later this year that will demonstrate exactly why we need NOAA and FEMA. Then all of the economic fallout which will take some time to truly become unavoidably visible. Give it until the end of the year, but there will still be about 25% of Republicans that are so deep in the cult they will never disobey Trump.",T0rtillaBurglar,2025-04-26T15:33:57,5
"I do not believe that our Thief In Chief will willingly leave the White House, again.",mia_elora,2025-04-27T02:53:51,1
