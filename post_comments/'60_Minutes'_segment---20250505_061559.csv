This is the same Marc Elias behind the fake Steele Dossier and also sanctioned and disciplined by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. This jerk has no credibility whatsoever and got so toxic even the DNC wouldn't associate with him.   Yet here he is talking shit and 60 Minutes is eating it up. Says much about their credibility too.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-05T07:21:48,125
"So to recap, Trump removed the Hillary Clinton's favorite law firm, Perkins Coie lawyers security clearances and government building access. And here we have 60 minutes allowing Hillary Clinton's lawyer, Marc Elias, to state that by doing this Trump puts ""rule of law at risk"", without debate.   All while they are arguing in court that they are an unbiased news agency.   CBS really needs to learn what journalistic integrity means or at least consider why the public trust in journalism has plummeted. Try to find a single CBS News article that was ever negative towards Hillary Clinton.",BarrelStrawberry,2025-05-05T09:06:44,76

"Marc Elias is one of the main figures who helped defend the steal of the 2020 election. I guess we should thank him! Without that level of brazen corruption, can you imagine Trump's second term being this good? It was the shake-up needed to wake the right up.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T14:07:50,-18
"Elias referred to Trump as ""the walking embodiment of everything that is wrong with the American political system"" and suggested the rule of law is at risk if these executive orders stand. Without that, Elias claimed, Trump could take on other institutions.  Yup, it is the same Mark Elias, here are criminal elements that say President Trump is a threat to their legal system. I hope so, their system is based upon lies, fraud, hypocrisy and their love of the left. That same Mark Elias that has no problems with Biden, Hussein, Kamala and a host of other characters!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-05T08:01:42,24

"There is an old saying, it's better to keep your mouth shut and be thought stupid than to open your mouth and remove doubt.    Thats comes to mind when I think of Kamala being president.  We don't really know who was calling the shots when Joe was their meat puppet, but would Kamala have really been any better?  She's a political opportunist void of morals, same as Joe.    What I'm getting at is, would it have been better to have a visual in Kamala than an obvious dementia case in cognitive decline freefall?  These types of people are cut from the same cloth, same people would have been calling the shots with her too.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-05T15:28:44,1
"Better to have a WH elected official (Kamala) for that purpose than have James Clyborne [(edit - here's one side-eye source)](https://youtu.be/cOrlW-kQLq0?feature=shared&t=270) and company run things out of the public eye - at least we'd have some kind of oversight of Kamala. Also, we may have gotten a better candidate from the democrats. I think Trump is doing really well, but I wonder what's going to happen to the other party. I feel really betrayed by having a group of people I don't know running the country. They did find the $ fed employee who was stealing funds - $651k in 60+ checks to herself and a friend.",lady__jane,2025-05-05T15:56:12,1

Earlier conspiracy theory was Obama.   To your point, Kamala would have shown herself or risen to the challenge. Either way, I would rather have her real self running things than people we did not elect or see. Just feels so gross to be had like that.",lady__jane,2025-05-05T15:58:38,2
