My Trump-supporting brother-in-law just got laid off from a brewery because they can't afford the hops from Canada and the aluminum from China now.  Its almost like I told him so.,AnteaterPositive6939,2025-04-22T12:43:33,27
"One of them was my cousin in Ohio who worked for an auto assembly plant. I haven’t spoken to him in 15+ years, but my mother let me know through his belligerent Facebook post asking Trump to spare him and his family as he voted for him 3 times.  He’s reaping what he voted for and I am so happy for him.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-04-22T12:50:14,22

"Trump desperately wanted to believe that doing the same thing as Hitler did in 1933 - impose massive tariffs right after taking power - would work for him. He and Stephen Miller probably had a good laugh about it.  It's not working. It's a disaster, and every day he will be blamed more and more for it. No one could deserve the hatred of America more than this scumbag.",sillyrabbit39,2025-04-22T12:42:50,12
"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is set to enter a “new era” marked by “significantly” slower economic growth caused by tariff chaos and uncertainty brought about by President Donald Trump.  “The global economic system under which most countries have operated for the last 80 years is being reset, ushering the world into a new era,” the financial agency wrote in a blog post. The IMF noted the flurry of tariffs Trump has levied or threatened against hundreds of countries and major trade partners.

Miller and Trump don't understand the differences in the world between the 1930s and now.   They really are following a checklist that worked in 1933.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T12:49:18,14
"I knew Trump's 2nd term would destroy the US, I didn't realize he would take down the whole world, too. And in only 3 months, wow.",ferociouswhimper,2025-04-22T12:58:01,10
