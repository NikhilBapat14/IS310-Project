"If we are going to focus on the Pacific theater of WW2, then we have to admit the uncomfortable truth. China played an important role in fighting the Japanese to prevent them from deploying everything they had to Southeast Asia and against America. If China had folded like France, the outcome of the Pacific theater would be much different.   The problem is that USSR (and now Russia) and China are our enemies. If we are honest about history, that will make it harder to portray USSR/Russia and China as ""evil"" and ""the bad guys"". It is much easier to just ignore their contributions. This isn't unique to Trump. We have been doing it since the end of WW2.",xibeno9261,2025-05-09T09:15:46,5
Can you imagine a coward wanting a military parade. Can’t wait to see how many medals he will have on his uniform,snowmanu812,2025-05-09T12:21:29,3
Trump has a distorted view of history. He's just trying to change things to make himself look better.,Illustrious-Bridge45,2025-05-09T08:27:36,2

"Dumald Trump knows a lot about pain, did he not spent Vietnam war home like a coward nursing his imaginary bone spur, like the true coward that he is. Mr. Wainwright heroism is something is something the trumps despises. He will probably have his diary destroyed now he knows where it is",snowmanu812,2025-05-09T12:01:57,1
This is one of those diversion tactics - acting like he honors what the U.S. fought for in WWII while simultaneously destroying it. Everything that Trump truly represents is exactly what embodied our enemies in the war. He’s a sick human being who needs to go the same way Mussolini did,Automatic_Employ7537,2025-05-09T18:05:31,1
Do Americans even learn they joined late in both world wars?,Bethorz,2025-05-09T15:35:25,1
"""Trump posted on social network Truth Social late on Thursday that ""nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance"" in both world wars, and that ""we did more than any other country, by far, in producing a victorious result in World War II.'""   Part of Trump's revisionist history. Of course, the United States had major contributions. But us, doing more than any other country is ludicrous as exemplified by your Illustrations above. Trump is now trying his hardest to throw away all those political gains that were a result of our efforts in World War 2.",Illustrious-Bridge45,2025-05-09T14:41:42,2
"It is because trump wants to make VE Day the end of World War 2, when it did not end until Japan surrendered. It is a disservice to the military that served in the Pacific Theater until the end of the war ( including my father). He could have just said, let's celebrate VE and VJ Day with proclamations, instead of trying to say VE Day was the end of the war. He probably has never read a history book (aside from Mein Kampf) in his entire life. He thinks Robert E. Lee was irish",Illustrious-Bridge45,2025-05-09T14:53:00,1
"We didn't, though at least for WWII.  We were sending arms and aid to USSR and England from the beginning.  We sent planes and volunteer pilots to China to help the resistance fight Japan well before Pearl Harbor.",velvet_funtime,2025-05-09T15:38:13,2
"Those that know history know. We really wanted to avoid joining at all in both of those. Trump is the guy, getting the empty netter, and wanting all the glory for that.",Illustrious-Bridge45,2025-05-09T16:25:52,1
"> Part of Trump's revisionist history.   But this isn't just Trump. We have downplayed the efforts of the Soviets in the Atlantic theater, and the Chinese in the Pacific theater ever since the end of WW2. Both Democrat and Republican administration have tried to downplay USSR/Russia and China, and instead try to make it look like it was America, Britain, and France that did the bulk of the work.   Just look at the 5 permanent members of the UN security council. Russia and China are there, not because America likes them.",xibeno9261,2025-05-09T14:46:30,2
