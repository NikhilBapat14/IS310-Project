"FYI Ruby Bridges is still alive, and was the first African American to attend a formerly all white segregated school In Louisiana. How sad she must feel to see progress made in her lifetime erased.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-05-02T16:27:17,33
"America is fully embracing its racist past once more. To everyone who voted for Trump, voted third party, or didn't vote at all: *this is your fault*. Was it worth it?! I hope it was, because *none* of you will *EVER* be forgiven for it.",LordSiravant,2025-05-02T16:53:02,26

They'll use the internet to spread pseudo science and make a case that miscegenation is bad because black people are hit harder by hypertension, sickle cell anemia, etc. Then they'll redline and incentivize initiatives that lead to racial separation in living areas.

Anyone sounding the alarm will be deemed ""triggered"", ""oversensitive"" and people will by into that.    Republiklans gonna Republiklan.",NoAir5292,2025-05-03T20:21:43,1
