It's a worrying sign when tracking with past generations going through the 18-29 range. Considering that total youth turnout dropped 3% points overall that's also not a good sign but somewhat expected.

"2020 was an anomaly. The ‚Äúdrop‚Äù in 2024 was still much higher than historical turnout for that age group.  I don‚Äôt think younger generations are less liberal/progressive. I think the younger generation has a different relationship to what those words mean. They have never really had a ‚Äústandard‚Äù Republican/conservative President in their lifetimes (old enough to pay attention to politics).  And the GOP that they did have exposure to was Trump‚Äôs GOP. Trump is by no means conservative in the same sense as Bush and previous. Trump is a populist and young people are typically drawn to populism. Trump plays the rhetoric well enough and knows how to manipulate media well enough that if you‚Äôre new to politics or not super aware of everything, his words at face value might sound like a good thing and might be enough to make you think the bad things that slip out are worth it for the good things.  I think it‚Äôs a total mistake to chalk this down to liberal vs conservative, and if we keep drawing that false and outdated dichotomy, we‚Äôll keep being shocked about results that don‚Äôt make sense under that idea despite making perfect sense in other ways.  In terms of social rights, the younger generations are just as if not more progressive.

"I think that's a fair assessment and I'm largely in agreement. We can split hairs as to what it means to be conservative or liberal but it's a worrying sign to me that someone as objectively-crooked as Trump can pass as a viable candidate for anyone. It's no surprise like you said that the newcomers to politics who are a bit naive and inexperienced in being played as pawns would fall victim to the tactics of the sleazy snake-oil salesman ‚Äî in this case, I'd argue that would chiefly be Steve Bannon who helped strategize over going after young men and quite literally said that Trump did not need the women's vote; and so instead curated the red-pilled incel Joe Rogan / Jordan Peterson toxic masculine and incel groups.  To your point, it's still reflective of the bigger picture that no doubt Trump supporters and couch-sitters alike feel the pressures they gripe about. Their anger and vulnerabilities just tend to be exploited by those who control the vast majority of media ‚Äî rich white conservative men, both foreign (e.g., Russia) and domestic (Musk, Bezos, Murdoch, Bannon, Rogan, etc.)  If this is all you see and hear, then the absurd becomes normalized.

We have to confront these things head-on and I am very comfortable speaking with Trump supporters these days but it's so difficult to reach them by design. The cult intentionally isolates itself while truckloads of money reinforce their preconceived notions, whether it's Fox News or some podcast in their car or church or talk radio, etc.  I still think it's a stretch and we may be past the point of no return but the only way I see out of this from a messaging standpoint is fighting populism with populism. One of the biggest predictors on how someone voted was their education level, and that gap seems to be widening. If we can simplify our message from the top-down with a progressive economic populist message that is, ""it's not the trans or the poor immigrant fleeing crime and poverty; it's the rich guy stealing your shit and forcing us to fight over crumbs!"" then that may resonate better than things like, ""Opportunity economy.""
