There is a solution available to illegal immigrants who wish to avoid the weeks-long detention prior to deportation. Make your own arrangements and leave now.,Willow-girl,2025-05-06T08:49:32,399
"From the article. ‚Äú   ‚ÄúDeferred Action was where they found that they had violated the immigration laws by overstaying their visas, but they had given through humanitarian reasons, or other reasons, what was called deferred action, which meant that they were told that ICE would take no action against them.‚Äù  Some had been ‚Äúdeferred‚Äù for 20-30 years. Somehow the paragraph above morphs ‚Äúdeferred action‚Äù to ‚Äúno‚Äù action.  They are citing 100 or more cases.   These are mostly overstayed visas.  Oh well, visa over? Go home.",pixmanohio,2025-05-06T10:20:38,71

What gets me about this article is that the writer is complaining that some of these people have been here for 20-30 years.  Why have they not fixed their stuff by now?  It sounds like they had no intentions of actually doing the right thing if they have had 20-30 years to get their stuff in order.,Allyanni,2025-05-06T09:26:55,119

You have to leave the country to start proper immigration procedures and can not come in until it‚Äôs finalized. That‚Äôs why they haven‚Äôt fixed it in the last 20 years.,Blahblahnownow,2025-05-06T10:39:00,74

"The left has spoken about past discrimination against the Irish for a long time.

"The left has routinely ignores the Irish when talking about slaves. Two news articles from the US left hardly paints a picture of media coverage. The BBC and the Irish times have a vested interest in talking about diasporic Irish. It would be weirder if they didn't mention it, especially when the EU can then pretend that the US hates the whole world by pointing to this ""persecution.""",PFirefly,2025-05-06T11:08:19,9
