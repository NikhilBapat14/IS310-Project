"The America we all grew up in is dead.  The one we convinced ourselves we were living in is gone.  America being the leader of the free world is done now.  We need to deal with the hurt, shake it off, and fight like hell to build something better than what we are being offered.  The oligarchs vision for the future is a perversion brought on by their disgusting worldview.  These are small men playing out pathetic god complexes at everyone's expense.  We are in the middle of a class war that most Americans are too stunned or propaganda sick to even notice and we are losing badly.  Everything happening right now is a coordinated dismantling and sale of our federal government to the would-be oligarchs.  The erosion of checks and balances, whereby Congress has ceded its power and SCOTUS stands impotent.  They are purposefully disregarding the courts to test their limits.  The destruction of government agencies in order to encourage poverty, illness, and crime in our communities to weaken our resistance. There will be no federal aid for the noncompliant.  The threatening of our lives and liberty with disgusting shows of force against those who speak out or simply seek refuge.    They have allowed American citizen children to be removed to test the public's reaction.  The disruption of global trade and domestic supply chains.  Nothing provides better cover for a massive upward transfer of wealth than a financial crisis.  We will be made to own nothing.  They have installed puppets at all levels of government.  Bondi and Patel are his personal attack dogs.  Miller provides the meat for the white nationalist base.  Hegseth is a drunk with a crusader fetish, but the reordering being done in the military command structures should alarm everyone.  Anyone with loved ones in the military should reiterate to them their oath includes not following illegal orders.  That they should refuse to deploy within US borders.  The destruction of our military alliances and global soft power serves to isolate us from the world and make domestic security worse overall.  While all of this is happening, they will begin to sell what is left piecemeal in the name of privatization. They are going to sell federal land to allow more technocratic company towns like ""starbase"" in TX.  I need everyone to really look at what is going on in our country.  Think about the implications carefully.  So many are still talking about this as if it is just politics.  ""We'll get em in the midterms"" is not good enough because unless we have drastic changes in policy, I don't see us having free and fair elections by then.",Oi_cnc,2025-05-09T18:07:46,74

"This was not a ""check on"", this was trespassing. Being an elected official does not grant someone the right to trespass. He broke the law. He was warned multiple times to leave peacefully and he did not.   It's not being a ""Nazi"" to arrest someone for trespassing. It was a political stunt by a Democrat Mayor who wants to be Governor of NJ in the future. He wanted his name and picture in the media across the country.   Calling Conservatives and Republicans as ""Nazis"" will only push away undecided voters from the center. It's a horrible way to consistently lose independent voters. This is part of why Democrats lost all the swing states and the popular vote in 2024.   Being an elected Democrat does not grant you immunity from trespassing. Because of this Mayor's ""status"", he was told multiple times to cease, desist and walk away. Probably more than the average person would get before they would be arrested.

"The question here is whether there is a Conflict Preemption and whether the city is factually able to contest GEO Group's *inherent ability* to use contract such a facility. Part of that depends on the Mayor's claim that it has not passed local ordinances, which may be a necessary procedural concern of local ordinance (whether or not the enforcement of local ordinance falls under the Supremacy clause vs. an inspection that may be effectively rendered useless *at least under this contractor which is assumed to be as temporary of the lease*). For instance, while the city cannot discriminate against a facility that can operate in its state according to THE GEO GROUP V. NEWSOM and several out cases, there may be further legal review to be done regarding the cities ability to discriminate against a GEO Group's *re-opening of facility* that they tried to contract out for a purpose that may conflict with local ordinances.   What I am saying is that the city may still have a right to *inspect* a facility operating within the city for fire code. Further, it may be in *GEO GROUP's interest* and specifically shareholders to provide the best knowledge available for future leasing of the facility and whether, what may be a recently renovated facility, falls under fire code. The city has plenty of reason to do-so, including the review of a very large facility that could easily be a safety issue for not just the responding fire officials, but also buildings in the proximity. Especially given buildings of this size and the possibility of a five alarm fire, which could be relevant to coordinating with local response in a *timely manner* to ensure the safety of responding personnel in addition to plans to handle reasonably anticipatable events at the facility (in addition to fire exits, types of alarms, etc.,) Documentation on this facility and its compliance with local fire code, whether there are Conflict Preemptions still provides substantial information to governing authorities regarding the appropriate level of response and their preparedness. Whether this does indeed result in a substantial financial loss or burden to GEO Group may be irrelevant if the ability to inspect *does not* and remains a power that does not fall outside of the supremacy clause. That could be contested under existing precedent, but the purpose of fire code and its instrumentation may fall beyond this.",postsshortcomments,2025-05-09T20:46:06,0

"I appreciate that we are on the same side, but I’m not about that.  I encourage you and anyone to learn from the success of AANES (Autonomous Area of North and Eastern Syria) if you haven’t already. They have provided a great example of how to beat this type of enemy, though they had support of US AirPower not the threat of receiving it.  Their success is largely due to their legitimacy. They are obviously the better party and they go to lengths to live up to that image. All with a practical form of logic that reflects the largely agricultural and mountainous region. To kill another is to harm oneself, and to harm oneself is to harm your community. Executions will always include innocents and even one innocent victim of state execution is un-aceptable.  There is a lot of old” eastern” theory about how suffering will plant a seed of resentment, so might as well kill. Well I’ve already established why you shouldn’t kill casually like that but Chinese history makes that point better than any of us ever could.  Next there is the common phenomenon of outsiders sympathizing with the punished or oppressed, no matter how well deserved. I associate this with Western European writings from the late renaissance onwards but I’m sure it’s been documented much, much earlier and more widespread than that. *This is a common element where the rightfully punished gain reprieve from their punishments*  Finally, if you normalize violence by the state and individuals like that, it will not be contained at the gates of the prison. It will come in to the guards and executioners homes. It will leak in to every facet of government starting with the armed ones, we don’t have to deal with problems when we can just kill our way to what we want.  These people are a problem.

"“ICE does not need a warrant to make an arrest ICE officers are sworn federal law enforcement officers who operate within the confines of the law. Section 287 of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides ICE officers the authority to arrest aliens without a judicial warrant. In fact, no judge in this country has the authority to issue a warrant for a civil immigration violation. Congress, by statute, vested this authorization solely to supervisory immigration officers. Local police officers don’t need a warrant when they encounter someone breaking the law in a public space, and the same holds true for ICE officers. Obstructing or otherwise interfering with an ICE arrest is a crime, and anyone involved may be subject to prosecution under federal law.

It’s more of an opinion blog that is attempting to interpret laws. It has no control over ICE or any federal agency.  A law enforcement officer doesn’t need an arrest warrant to apprehend a suspect who is committing a crime. They don’t have to tell a person seen selling a controlled substance to wait while they get an arrest warrant, or to tell a person seen trespassing to, “Stay here while I get a warrant and then arrest you.”  The same is true for all federal agents, including ICE.
