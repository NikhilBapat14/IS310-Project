"[Archive link](https://archive.ph/IbdmQ) >The Post examined immigration and court records, and conducted interviews with attorneys, friends and family members, to piece together information about more than 50 of the men believed to be imprisoned at the Terrorism Confinement Center, the megaprison often referred to by its Spanish acronym, CECOT. **The review shows that despite the administration‚Äôs claims, many of the immigrants sent to El Salvador had entered the United States legally and were actively complying with U.S. immigration rules.**  >At least two of the men imprisoned in El Salvador had been approved by the State Department to resettle as refugees in the U.S. after extensive vetting by federal law enforcement authorities, documents show. At least four had protections against removal through temporary protected status, often called TPS, granted to those fleeing Venezuela‚Äôs humanitarian crisis, according to attorneys for the men or records shared with The Post. Others had been active members of Venezuela‚Äôs opposition and had open asylum claims.  Seems pretty clear why Republicans no longer like due process.  To be clear: Trump took law abiding people and sent them to one of the world's most notorious prisons. They are able to lie about it on Fox News and in the breifing room... but not in the courts.",Infidel8,2025-05-04T06:44:52,76
Is what I read true? That Trump used these flights to deport one of the leaders of MS-13 that was pending trial in the US? That this was after the US had him extradited to the US to face trial? And that the president of El Salvador released him from prison once he arrived?   Has there been additional investigation around whether this was the real motivation for these flights? To basically bust a co-leader of MS-13 out of US custody and free him in El Salvador‚Ä¶,tackle_bones,2025-05-04T09:10:50,18

"Also, people forget that even if you immigrate illegally, this is considered a civil offense, not criminal. So, there is absolutely no reason at all to send anyone to prison over this, let alone a death camp.",FreshRest4945,2025-05-04T06:55:23,41

"Because Bukele made secret deals with MS-13 and he doesn't want people to know about them. So he pushed Trump to deport the guy and not charge him, so he can't talk about these deals in a US court. In exchange, he'll let Trump deport whoever he wants into his gulags with little to no pushback.

"I find it hilarious that now the civil vs criminal aspect is all of a sudden important.  It can‚Äôt be both ways‚Ä¶ same people call Trump a rapist, even though he was only found liable for sexual assault in civil court",Numerous_Speed_8595,2025-05-04T11:07:37,-5

I mean it is important. And the judge in trumps case pointed out the sexual assault trump committed would be classified as rape so‚Ä¶.  And he himself has bragged about assaulting women and there‚Äôs other times he was accused of rape. Like when he raped his first wife for laughing about his hair transplant.,FalstaffsGhost,2025-05-04T12:30:31,2

"All of that is incorrect.  You‚Äôve never really sat down to think about what you‚Äôre saying or you hate Trump so bad you‚Äôre incapable of doing it accurately.  Share a source or an article to support your claims.  I know the locker room talk quote youre referring to‚Ä¶   that women let you kiss, them when your a star you can do anything, they let you do it‚Ä¶ grab em by the p**sy‚Ä¶.  That was essentially the quote without looking it up.  Your claim of him, ‚Äúbragging about assaulting women‚Äù is clearly a fallacy.  He literally was quoted saying, ‚Äúthey let you do it‚Äù.  That‚Äôs not assault",Numerous_Speed_8595,2025-05-04T14:46:25,-1
I mean he clearly did rape someone but as far as your assault reference goes uhhhh:  https://youtu.be/zgUvwcU6P7I?si=bMO9AzkWC0mCT5O7,Appropriate_Unit3474,2025-05-04T15:24:56,1
