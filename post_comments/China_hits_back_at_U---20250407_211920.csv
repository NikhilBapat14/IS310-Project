This is gonna trigger an actual war with China. Cutting off supplies to critical minerals is a major national security threat. They are the only ones with certain metals that we need for building things like jet engines.  ,Critical-General-659,2025-04-07T21:25:04,1
"the link behaves weird, so first part of the article here:  BEIJING/LONDON, April 4 (Reuters) - China placed export restrictions on rare earth elements on Friday as part of its [sweeping response](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/europe-prepares-response-trump-tariffs-global-markets-plunge-2025-04-04/) to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, squeezing supply to the West of minerals used to make weapons, electronics and a range of consumer goods.      The move, which Beijing had long hinted was possible, further ratchets up trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and leaves American manufacturers scrambling for fresh supplies of the critical minerals they have relied upon for decades.  China [produces around 90% of the world's rare earths](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/world-battles-loosen-chinas-grip-vital-rare-earths-clean-energy-transition-2023-08-02/), a group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics industries. The United States has only one rare earths mine and most of its supply comes from China.      Beijing announced the controls late on Friday as part of a broader package of tariffs and company restrictions in retaliation for Trump's decision to [hike tariffs](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-escalate-global-trade-tensions-with-new-reciprocal-tariffs-us-trading-2025-04-02/) against most Chinese products to 54%.      The export curbs include not only mined minerals but permanent magnets and other finished products that will be difficult to replace, analysts said.      The move, which affects exports to all countries, not just the U.S., is the latest demonstration of China's ability to [weaponize its dominance](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/) over the mining and processing of the critical [minerals.Seven](http://minerals.Seven) categories of medium and heavy rare earths, including samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium-related items, will be placed on an export control list as of April 4, according to a Ministry of Commerce release.      Lockheed Martin [(LMT.N),](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LMT.N) Tesla [(TSLA.O), ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/TSLA.O)and Apple [(AAPL.O), ](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/AAPL.O)are among the U.S. companies that use Chinese rare earths in their supply chains.""China made that list strategically,"" said Mel Sanderson, a director at American Rare Earths [(ARR.AX)](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/ARR.AX), which is building a Wyoming rare earths mine it hopes to open by 2029, and co-chair of the Critical Minerals Institute trade group. ""They picked the things that are crucial for the U.S. economy.      ""While the export controls stop short of an outright ban, Beijing can throttle shipments by restricting the number of export licenses it issues.China's move will create ""a scramble for access to the limited sources of alternative supply – namely in Japan and South Korea,"" said Ryan Castilloux, founder of consultancy Adamas Intelligence.",belisario262,2025-04-07T21:25:14,1

Pretty much why Japan bombed Pearl Harbor. They were trying to break the blockade the US had on them for invading China. Of all countries. ,Blablablaballs,2025-04-07T21:28:23,1
