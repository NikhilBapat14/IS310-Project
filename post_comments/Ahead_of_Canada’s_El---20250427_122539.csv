All Trump is doing is pushing the rest of West into China's arms and screwing the American people in the process.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-27T12:29:35,60
"Bold words from a lil' guy whose Senate job Invanka Trump decided was just TOO LITTLE for her.  LIL Marco has much to say, when he's standing in Trump's shadow, trying to impress him, not pressed down into a couch trying to hide, or trying to sip bottled water with his 2 shakey little claw-like hands....",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-27T12:48:54,11
"I read this as ""speaks out **against** Trump's plan to annex the country"" out of habit. And then I remembered the USA had been taken over by a bunch of fascist scum.  Know that if they actually do this, and they seem to be very keen on it, it will be one of those historic choices. Either the USA tears itself apart in rebellion and mutiny, or it's World War 3 and the USA's democracy going down in flames will simply be a footnote among all the other terrible things that happen. Maybe the better choice here is to threaten them with a revolution *before* they do this so as to scare them away from trying.",barryvm,2025-04-27T14:10:57,8
"Trumps base and his detractors would love if he ""gave"" New York to Canada, but he, Vance and Rubio are smart enough to know the country can't survive without us. Sadly he's not that deep into his own nonsense.",rainshowers_5_peace,2025-04-27T12:33:23,12
The Nazis still have their eye on taking over Canada and rapping the country of all natural resources,CAM6913,2025-04-27T14:28:59,5
"How come no journalists ever ask 'By what mechanism does Canada become a state?' I mean, do we invite them? What happens when they say no, politely?   Do we then invade them militarily? I suspect that might end much like Russia's 3 day war in Ukraine, except we'd also have NATO and the UN on our asses.  Do we just buy up all their real estate, load it with settlers and hold another election? Well, Vlad tried that too and no one bought it.  So Little Marco, how do make Canada a state again?",SwvellyBents,2025-04-27T17:12:47,7
It's nice of Trump & Rubio to campaign for Mark Carney,Visual-Report-2280,2025-04-27T12:30:17,19
Americans can fuck right off.,Zeta411North,2025-04-27T12:51:40,21
"Trump states in his interview “We don't need anything from Canada….. I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state.” So by this logic, any country which produces stuff Trump says the US doesn’t need, must become a US state? That’s some very strange shit right there.",dutchroll0,2025-04-27T16:07:57,5

I can’t believe there are 100s of millions of Americans who simply give zero shits that their country is burning to the ground.,ZombieHannibal,2025-04-27T17:14:32,5

We literally don't have a single true ally left. Just countries that have to deal with us because of who we are  But of course someone like Trump probably thinks this is how things should be. Rule with fear sort of thing,ATLfalcons27,2025-04-27T12:37:16,40

Don’t exclude thanking PP for his anti-woke and MAGA ideologies which is also campaigning  for Carney.,DangerDarrin,2025-04-27T12:46:56,9

"NY borders Canada, so it would be easier. I guess ""Seattle"" and ""Portland"" have bad reputations so his base might go for it but it would be a harder sell.  Again, for all his idiocy Trump knows the other 48 would be fucked without CA and NY. He might shit on them to rile up his base but he ain't letting them go without a war.",rainshowers_5_peace,2025-04-27T13:20:48,5

Trump heard that incorrectly and thought it was “speak loudly and be an incompetent dick.”,randomwanderingsd,2025-04-27T14:23:56,8
"Washington state is all-in.  Oregon outside of Portland could take some convincing.  There are other strong blue states like MA that'd flip on MAGA-USA in a nanosecond.  Trump is a FAILURE.  Always has been.  Always WILL BE.  His non-stop Trump-talk is intended to agitate -- he's nothing but an angry chattering squirrel in the history of this nation.  His expiration date - politically and otherwise -  is near, and this country will go on.  As with all the idiot GOP who drive this country into the mud, Dems will be here to clean up his mess, reverse his hateful policies on Day 1, and work to patch up the loopholes that let these roach-parasites in.  It aint over till it's over, s'all I'm saying...",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-27T13:41:09,5
"Hey, if the US invades Canada I'll do what I can to undermine that invasion.  Many others in the States will, too.  I'm simply saying that blanket condemnations of the US are not well-founded.",SpaceElevatorMusic,2025-04-27T13:29:42,13

There'll be no kind words exchanged in this process.  This is why so many states (including Washington) have recently passed legislation to criminalize any US military presence that the Governor did not specifically request.,XSinTrick6666,2025-04-27T14:15:10,1
