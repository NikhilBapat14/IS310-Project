He also says he didn't rape women. Doubt.,RJE808,2025-05-05T09:28:32,28
It wouldn't surprise me if he tries to delay or cancels the election outright. Things are going to get wild in the last year of his current term. That's the dictator move to make.,NuevoXAL,2025-05-05T09:29:15,13
This might not mean what people think it means.,tlacamazatl,2025-05-05T09:29:41,9
Of course not. You can’t seek a new term if there are no more elections.,M3rlyn,2025-05-05T09:29:27,7
1) He literally can't   2) Nothing he says is true,TheThebanProphet,2025-05-05T09:29:18,8
Confirmed. Trump is totally going for a third term.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-05T09:34:18,6
"He CAN'T run a third time, quit treating this like it's his decision.",Demonofthedark1313,2025-05-05T09:39:18,5
"""I won't seek my third term, but so so many people asking me to run for third term. I don't want to, I have a perfect life and I don't have to do all this. But god saved my life and I think I have to answer the call. I don't have to be president, but people wanted me to run for third term.""  \--Trump 2027 probably.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-05T09:42:09,5
The way this headline is written is part of the reason why we got here:  The media has normalized Trump and his behavior. This headline reads as if seeking a third term is a thing. It’s not a thing. It’s illegal. The context is insane. It should read “Trump changes his mind on blatantly breaking the law and ignoring the constitution.”   A similar type of headline could also read: Sean Diddy Combs decides not to attend Monday night’s Met Gala,susibirb,2025-05-05T10:00:38,5
Trump just means he’s thinking of running as VP and then getting the president to step down so he can be president again,hamsterfolly,2025-05-05T09:32:11,4
"He's also not a pedophile, a rapist, a felon. He doesn't wear makeup, nor does he shit his pants. Let's even hope he doesn't make it to be an 8 year president. Republicans do your job and get him out of power. He is a moron and is destroying the American way and the rule of law. Fuck him and the people that voted for this loser.",Variak21,2025-05-05T09:39:12,3
"His first 100 days have not been fun for him.  He doesn't cope well with pushback.  At this rate, he may be tempted to leave early.  He desperately wants to be glorified but there isn't much glory outside of those fawning North Korean cabinet meetings of his.",I405CA,2025-05-05T09:33:29,3
"> President Trump has conceded he will be a “two-term president”  I'd bet good money he means one term of four years and one ""term"" of eight.",DaveChild,2025-05-05T09:40:17,3
Ole Flip Flop Don. His brains are as scrambled as his word vomits!  Brought to you by those critical of the prior vegetable. Make it make sense…,SimTheWorld,2025-05-05T09:42:12,3
He is walking it back now because the GOP is seeing concerning rhetoric from a huge swath of the electorate that says they will regret the continued attacks on our Democracy.   They know they cannot boil the frog to fast otherwise it will foment a reaction.,vox_popul1,2025-05-05T10:11:45,3
And why the hell would anyone believe him?,Wings81,2025-05-05T09:38:43,2
I am calling it bullshit. Or liar liar pants on fire.,ComfortableAcadia252,2025-05-05T09:43:07,2
"He also did say here that he would be an 8 year president.   But this is doublespeak, he has also said that there are methods for him to run again.  ",New-Arm-9816,2025-05-05T09:47:31,2
"He won't seek it, but he'll declare Martial Law and invoke whatever ""national security"" scheme he can and refuse to leave. The Secret Service and DOJ will go along with it and the military will refuse to intervene and he'll stay in office until he dies, which will probably be another 20 years considering his pops lived into his 90s.",--444--,2025-05-05T09:53:43,2

He'd be 82. At some point it will be too obvious that he is pooping his pants.,30mil,2025-05-05T09:39:35,1
This shouldn’t be news,candybeep,2025-05-05T09:48:08,1
Let's just make it through today with him ok??,HENMAN79,2025-05-05T09:55:48,1

He can’t do that anyway. It would go against the 14th amendment iirc.,Mindless_Western4413,2025-05-05T09:37:06,2
So does his current term - his 1/6/21 insurrection makes him Constitutionally ineligible for the office.  We are already living in a post-Constitution America.,Hestia_Gault,2025-05-05T09:51:23,6
