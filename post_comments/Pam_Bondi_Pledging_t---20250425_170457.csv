"To MAGA: At what point are you guys going to recognize how serious this is? that we are headed into an authoritarian state where people can be detained without due process having not been charged with a crime? If you can't have the decency to realize how seriously awful, cruel, and evil this is at least admit that you don't care if something is awful and cruel. These are acts that are happening outside of the confines of the constitutional rights that all permanent residences are entitled to. The president is now, live on TV for all of us to hear, stating that sending US citizens to foreign prisons without charges or due process is something that is being considered. Now they're saying they can ignore the 4th amendment and break into peoples homes without ANY cause. How are you all not up in arms over what is literally by definition, authoritarianism? Something that is fundamentally counter to the very fabric of this country?  I think it's because you people genuinely either can't see it or you don't care. And I have a hard time knowing which is which. But I'll tell you right now, blood is on your hands, and history will not look kindly to you or anyone who condones this regardless of what happens next.  You are the evil that we were warned about. You are why after the holocaust we said ""never again"". You are the ones who stood by and either ignored it or are okay with it.

Laws mean nothing anymore, and I really dont see why civilians would care about them anymore—the social contract has been broken.

"Exhibit A: John Kennedy, R-LA.

All of America should have been mortified by this fucking spectacle.  Here we have a Supreme Court nominee being multiply accused of sexual assault. And rather than handle it with dignity and a factual inquiry, rather than acknowledging that maybe they *shouldn't* tolerate politicians with credible accusations of sexual assault - the Republican Party rallies around **their guy** and turned it into a circus of political tribalism.  And at this peak moment of grotesque farce, we have a sitting U.S. congressman asking the accused to *swear to god* that the accusations weren't true. A tactic usually reserved for six-year-olds who were caught stealing cookies from the cookie jar and have chocolate smeared across their faces.  Here's the kicker. What did U.S. Congressman John Kennedy ask Blasey Ford? Did he give her the same mortifying option of *swearing to god* that her testimony was true? Nope. He didn't ask her *one fucking question.* Kavanaugh's word that she was lying was good enough for old man Kennedy.  In a rational world, every woman in America would have been screaming their head off about the indignity of resolving competing testimony about sexual assault by *taking the word of the accused* that the accuser was lying. A steaming, stinking, fetid pile of old-boys'-network bullshit, stuck in the same 1960's sexist garbage that Kennedy obviously enjoys.  The GOP is a goddamn national disgrace.

"There is one big problem with this pervasive narrative that the regime is looking for an excuse to impose martial law.  The problem is it doesn’t make sense. The regime’s goal is to strip mine the country, if not the world. That requires a functioning economy. Martial law completely undermines that goal. Just look at the chaos mere tariffs have caused.  Martial law would put a nail in the coffin of American stability—and stability is the minimum requirement for a working economy. The day this regime declares martial law is also the day markets seize up and collapse as investors of all stripes attempt to flee those markets all at the same time. Consumer spending and the confidence to go with it will fall off a cliff. It will signal to investors and governments world wide that the US is a failed state.  The regime may want to wield the *threat* of martial law as a way of suppressing dissent, but for the reasons I’ve stated, it doesn’t want to actually do it.  To put it simply, martial law would be *really bad for business.*",AtticaBlue,2025-04-25T20:20:34,33

Even by their own allegation, the worst she did was release him through a different exist to a public street where, theoretically, ICE is eligible to detain him.  If the worst of their allegation comes out like this, this case is getting tossed at some point.  Never mind that Patel and Bondi have already irreparably destroyed the chance of fair prosecution with their inappropriate and unethical public statements.    This is the weaponization that the accusations-are-a-mirror MAGA cult has always whined about.    And even if we ignore all of that and pretend that one some level Patel and Bondi actually do have some figment of their being that cares about law enforcement and justice, they just damaged both interests severely.  Using courthouse to ambush and black bag suspects means that nobody - good or bad - will want to engage in court processes.  That includes victims as well as suspects.  They’ll ignore subpoenas and skip appearances.  Outside of the movies, people of all types respecting the sanctity of courts is vital to our democracy.",AntoniaFauci,2025-04-25T19:14:25,8

Anyone out in the streets is taking a huge risk because even if we're not shipped to El Salvador, missing work for a short time could ruin our lives with no backup plan.

"But these people seem to either not care what’s bad for business or not understand it. I’m actually leaning towards the conclusion that they are not people with some well thought out evil master plan, they are not pretending to be crazy and incompetent for nefarious purposes. Their purposes are nefarious, yes, but also they really are crazy, they really are incompetent and they really are stupid. Which in many ways is more terrifying.   People seem to think that because they’ve got this far into taking over, they must be clever and have some meticulous strategy, but the truth is, they’ve only got this far because they r basically been cheating in a world where everyone else follows the rules. They think that following the rules is stupid when you could just smash them and get what you want and come out on top, but what they don’t realise is that people follow the rules for a reason not simply because they’re rules.   As you point out, stability is important for the economy, trust is important etc. If you cease to follow the rules at first you can blindside everyone and easily take charge, but the consequences will be far reaching, and negative, even for them. That’s what they don’t seem to understand. They seem to be cognitively incapable of predicting risks within highly complex human systems. Or understanding history and why aspects of human societies are as they are in the present day.  I genuinely think these people do not understand that. I think they are delusional and severely hubristic. In some ways their stupidity will eventually make it easier to defeat them but in other ways it will make it harder as it will take a while for their opponents to come to the realisation that they really don’t understand. People keep thinking that Trump wouldn’t do this or that because ultimately it would be bad for the economy or bad for him personally. So they don’t take the right actions as they aren’t seeing the motives or reasoning accurately. People are still trying to interpret them as if they are rational actors, even if evil ones with terrible ideas.  But from seeing these people in action  and what they’ve done so far, I’m pretty sure that they basically sit in a delusional echo chamber with very little knowledge or understanding of how systems work, how humans work within those systems, and only a rudimentary grasp of history or of how things have changed in ways that would alter outcomes if trying to implement historical actions today.

"I think it’s true that the regime figures are stupid, ignorant and driven by the kind of hubris that comes from being stupid and ignorant. However, having everyone who opposes them explicitly recognize this won’t change anything about the core drive to get rid of them. That’s already happening regardless, however effectively or ineffectively.  That said, it’s also true that the regime does respond in some fashion to “market signals” as we’ve seen with tariffs and the pushback not only by the market but also by highly-placed business executives. Both those actors clearly do recognize that destroying the system doesn’t work for them, so to that extent they’re natural allies with the common people who oppose the regime. However, since they have all the money and the regime is very much about accruing wealth for its members, the regime backs off at times.   However, their stupidity means they also set in motion events that have a momentum all on their own, even if/when they try to walk back some elements of their policy. So they may yet get the destroyed society described in the original narrative I’m critiquing.

"Just picking up on your comment, from what I understand her issue with the warrant was (probably appropriately) addressed separately by way of contacting the chief judge who had the right jurisdiction.  If her actions later were to arrive at her own idea of justice then the warrant issue can serve as a mitigation or defense for her action, but not as a means to nullify her arrest and charges.    I might not have worded that well.  So let’s use a simpler example.    One person is pulled over for speeding but wasn’t speeding at all.  The traffic cop misunderstood the road and thought the limit was 30 but it had been changed last month to 50.  They should not have been charged in the first place.  Consider another scenario where someone has shot a police officer on a country road and left them to die.  You come across the scene and load up the victim and rush them to hospital.  You are speeding, but you have a reason and a mitigation.    Most non-law people think the second scenario is better.  You’re a hero, you’re doing the right thing, you’re helping the very group who might oppose you speeding.  You have the best possible mitigating circumstances.

Aren’t you going down the court official’s exit today?”  With counsel who were cruising for custody for contempt, I might not blow up at them in court on the record, but with all counsel in chambers I might ask everyone what they had planned for the weekend and if everyone present had brought their toothbrush.
