"The ""Southern strategy"" was more of a mild nudge than a major shove.

"Not exactly ""switch."" The Republican party was founded out of the collapse of the Whig party to primarily oppose slavery. Most Republicans opposed slavery on economic/societal grounds  that it undermined free trade markets. Republicans who opposed slavery on purely ethical reasons were considered ""radical Republicans."" Democrats were the party of Andrew Jackson and were pro-slavery, more populist, and pro agrarian. After the Civil War the Republicans were the civil rights party and even had black men elected in the South. However, due to the 1876 election and fall out the South was given home rule and Southern Democrats implemented Jim Crow and the party begun to split more ideologically from North and South. Northern Democrats were Bourbon Democrats who were pro free markets while Southern Democrats became even more populist under William Jennings Bryant. During this time Republicans became more and more conservative around economic issues but also social issues. When Teddy Roosevelt became president he was in the minority faction of progressive Republicans. Wilson made an alliance with Bryant to unite Southern and North East Democrats. FDR cemented this alliance around economic issues while suppressing the more economically conservative Democrats. Republicans continued towards conservatism. Campaign of Barry Goldwater cemented Republicans as the conservative party and conservative Democrats started switching parties. LBJ signing the civil rights act super charged this trend as Southerners continued to align with the Republican party till about Obama when they took control of the South at every political level. Conservative Democrats have almost died out with the closest being Jared Golden Rep of Maine who is far more liberal than conservative Democrats pre-2000s. The liberal faction of the Republican party only survived in the North East prominently through their governors with Phill Scott of Vermont as probably the last liberal Republican in power. ",Dry_Extension1110,2025-04-10T13:46:55,16
