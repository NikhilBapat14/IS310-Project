"The state of Washington, which does not officially recognize Easter or Yom Kippur as state holidays, became the first state in the nation to recognize the two Islamic holidays of Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha as unpaid state-recognized holidays when Democrat Governor Bob Ferguson signed the legislation into law this month",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T08:18:51,360

"Even though Christmas and Easter originate as Christian holidays, they are inclusive to anyone and everyone. You don’t even need to mention god or Jesus once in order to celebrate those holidays, because the secular versions of those holidays coexist with the religious versions. The religious versions embrace just about everything about the secular versions, they just add God and stuff. The secular version just ignore God.  Are we going to see secular versions of Islamic holidays? I’m going to guess that if we do heads will roll. Figuratively speaking, of course.",Left4DayZGone,2025-04-25T09:08:44,50

"How about abolishing attorney-client privilege? Or forcing doctors, therapists and psychologists to testify against their clients/patients?  It is probably rare that a serious criminal would darken the doors of a church to begin with, let alone go to confession, but this would just mean that virtually no crimes would be confessed to priests because confession is voluntary and because there is no legal penalty for lying to a priest.  But doctors, psychologists, therapists and criminal defense lawyers .... why should they be privileged if the seal of confession is broken?",Phil152,2025-04-25T16:37:03,10

"Islam claims their god is the god of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, similar to Judaism and Christianity, however, Islam does not believe that God is a triune God consisting of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Islam also believes that Jesus was a prophet and not God in the flesh. Islam also believes that Muhammad was a prophet similar to Jesus, whereas Christian’s don’t believe Jesus was *just* a prophet but God Himself. The Quran will reference the Torah, which is the first five books of the Christian Bible, but the Quran contradicts itself and the Torah many, many times.",Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-25T09:05:30,38

"Only islamaphobes can’t see the mostly peaceful part of the violent and dramatic act of sawing a person’s head off for not submitting to their cult. /s  Most religions… you cut out the voodoo and dogma… and you’re left with what humanity decided over a few thousand years what were good basic rules and lessons to follow to have a society not eat itself and others alive. 7 out of 10 commandments are just this…. “Thou shalt not steal…” etc… Not these guys… it’s about control, submission, and conquest.

You’re 100% spot on. I have a Jewish friend that I studied the Torah with so I now have a habit of referring to it as that 😂,Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-25T10:39:41,5
Of course! There are plenty more differences as well! If you’re ever interested I’d encourage you to listen to some of Sam Shamoun’s debates. He’s a Christian who debates with Islam apologists and he is so well versed in the Quran it’s mind blowing.,Creepy-Nectarine-225,2025-04-25T09:28:54,8
