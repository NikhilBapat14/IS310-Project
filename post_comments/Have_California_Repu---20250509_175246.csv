"No, they can't. From their perspective, they're not doing anything wrong until they lose their reelection.  This is why we can not allow members of a gang of criminals into the government in the first place.  At this point in time, the republican party is absolutely a gang of criminals. The group meets multiple defintions for the terminology and should disbanded permently, by any remaining leadership in the party that still cares about human beings.  They have become monsters.",Actual__Wizard,2025-05-09T18:02:06,21

"> Like many California Republicans, Rep. Kevin Kiley has gone out of his way to show he’s not just on board with President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s priorities — he’s eager to help make them happen.  > Since Trump’s election, Kiley, of Rocklin (Placer County), has introduced bills to eliminate funding for California’s high-speed rail, to allow law enforcement officers to ignore the state’s sanctuary law and to reverse its law to phase out gas-powered cars. He even introduced a measure to reform Federal Aviation Administration bureaucracy that he made clear would benefit Musk’s SpaceX.  > So, it was a surprise to see a far more measured statement from Kiley on Friday asking his House colleagues to “provide robust funding for AmeriCorps” in the upcoming budget.  > It was a gentle way of acknowledging the obvious: Trump’s cuts are hurting his constituents.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T17:53:37,7

"His district is supposed to be relatively competitive with an [R+2 rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California%27s_3rd_congressional_district), with an odd stretch from Tahoe to Death Valley. CA has had an independent redistricting committee for about 15 years now, rather than the legislature drawing self-serving, funny-shaped districts.  Yet Kiley has routinely won his legislative elections by decisive margins. [His personal background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kiley_\(politician\)#Early_life,_education,_and_career) doesn't really hint he would grow up to be a MAGA sycophant.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T18:10:56,2

Anybody who isn’t on board to impeach and remove Trump is a MAGA sycophant. That’s the line. Any other president doing a fraction what has occurred these last 100 days would already be in court facing charges.,P1xelHunter78,2025-05-09T18:29:27,1

How does someone who wrote his Harvard undergrad thesis on the civil rights movement turn into a Trump apparatchik?,nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T18:38:45,1
I was recently driving through the California side of the Sierras to Reno and visited Mammoth Lakes in 2016. It really sucks how such an amazing part of CA in Congress has to be represented by this dunderhead.,nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-09T18:59:01,1

"Because an undergrad thesis is just an extra long essay written by someone in their 20s through hangovers and all night work sessions, and Ivy League schools are elitist organizations that prioritize money and prestige over education and research. People who go to these institutions are usually self-serving and care about their careers. That’s how JD Vance can go to Yale Law and then end up advocating for destroying the entire Constitution.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-09T18:57:01,2
