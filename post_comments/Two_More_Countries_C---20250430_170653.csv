"So now this SOB is looking to deport people to Libya and Rwanda. It’s like they’re trying to find places with the worst human rights records possible to send people.   It’s interesting to remember that in the lead up to the American Revolution, the British threatened those resisting the Crown with deportation overseas. Let’s see how Trump’s abuses will end up.",tonyt4nv,2025-04-30T17:10:12,23

">The Trump administration has discussed transferring migrants **with criminal records** held in the United States to two African countries, Libya and Rwanda, multiple sources familiar with the talks told [CNN](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/cnn).  With criminal records? You sure about that? Because this administration just falsely accuses people and counts it as a criminal record.",sachiprecious,2025-04-30T17:24:11,8

I thought that too. Apparently it means [to send out of the country or carry away](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deporting); [the removal from a country of an alien whose presence is unlawful or prejudicial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deportation).
