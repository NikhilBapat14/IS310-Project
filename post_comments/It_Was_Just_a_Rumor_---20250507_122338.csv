">Then came the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020, and the pandemic; suddenly cable networks long deemed trustworthy were peddlers of fake news, **on the right and the left.**  Both-sides bs.  >**The militia was prepared to defend against an imminent threat: Black Lives Matter protesters**, they believed, were plotting to invade the town and would be arriving on buses from the Bay Area at any moment.  Just the idea of scary Black people coming to visit their town was enough for them to cosplay as soldiers lol",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-07T13:31:41,53
"This is the real danger of everyone getting news solely from social media. In an era in which Americans have almost zero critical thinking skills and believe anything they are told online, we risk devolving into complete anarchy where we have no idea what is going on in the world. While traditional media has real problems, so does unquestioningly getting information solely from influencers or Facebook headlines.",Scarlettail,2025-05-07T12:43:10,37
"The lack of factual news coupled with the advancement of sycophantic AI is terrifying. I wish there was an easy solution, but this is rapidly becoming the norm. It's not just rural areas, it's becoming more and more common in cities as well. Until we begin teaching children critical thinking skills and how to do real, fact based research, it's only going to grow.",totalkpolitics,2025-05-07T14:27:52,5
"> By 2020, she had gotten rid of her television, replacing cable news programs like CNN and Fox News with mostly female news influencers on Instagram who aggregate the news into short video clips and graphics.  People are rejecting corporate, 'the truth gets in our way' agenda-driven media.  This is what populism looks like.  The country is healing after decades of neoliberal dysfunction.",box-cable,2025-05-07T12:33:10,-55
Methinks Eli Tan dost protest too much. I wonder why legacy media is dying. I wonder how PBS and NPR losing funding will impact these communities falling prey to lack of reliable news. I wonder what group caused this loss of funding.,Yctnm,2025-05-07T13:53:01,3

"Agree wholeheartedly. This is why I actually disagree with the common sentiment that mainstream media sources were “sanewashing” Trump. I don’t want my news sources to tell me how I ought to feel about a given event (usually done through emotionally charged headlines), I just want the factual information about what happened. I can decipher my own opinions on it based on my values (or, if the information is more esoteric and outside of my body of knowledge, by consulting experts in the field).",ConstantSea2833,2025-05-07T19:37:41,3
"Honestly reading this article just made me sad for the people who live there.  They have no idea what to believe, and have no local reporters left.  Made me unbelievably grateful not to live in a rural area. It's like the people there are going crazy and don't know how to get themselves out of the situation they are in.  I honestly don't believe you read the article if you thought this was a positive development in the world.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-07T12:48:49,21
You love fake news who push militia to go after blacks for totally no reasons.  You kinda say that racists fake news influencers make your country healing?   Are you Kyle?,NorthenFreeman,2025-05-07T12:56:34,17
"Healing..   >The militia was prepared to defend against an imminent threat: Black Lives Matter protesters, they believed, were plotting to invade the town and would be arriving on buses from the Bay Area at any moment.   >They waited and waited. But the protesters never came.   >The men were drawn to Oakdale by a false rumor spread in a Facebook group called All Things Oakdale, which over the years had become the town’s primary forum for local news. Started in 2015 by Ms. Logan, the group had amassed more than 17,000 members by 2020.",accountabilitycounts,2025-05-07T12:45:16,12

"In a ""what has happened to us"" viewpoint, this particular issue with rejecting actual, factual, responsible news really took off with The Daily Show. I remember being young and that was how myself and my friends got our news and especially political news.   I would argue the purpose of The Daily Show was to be humorous and earnestly informative, it was not disingenuous I don't feel. However it led to right wing attempts at a similar show, and eventually they said ""fuck the comedy part, that's hard to do and we're not good at it, just feed them our information"" and as that as mutated over the years here we are.  But as a liberal guy, I can't sit here and act like the roots of where we are now with misinformation weren't formed from shows I enjoyed, that again I feel were doing it in sincerity, and with the wrong people finding this route to disburse alternative news, has blossomed into this nightmare.",TaxGuy2930,2025-05-07T12:46:41,-1
"In my small town hometown, during the BLM protests of 2020, a local attorney got his buddies to parade around the downtown area with their little ar-15s and other small-penises representations to intimidate the protesters. It would be so bad, if this dufus didn’t also try to become the County Prosecutor. I’m glad I moved away a long time ago!",PrideofPicktown,2025-05-07T13:25:43,8
"I live in a rural area and I'm seeing this firsthand. People I've known for a long time are just believing the nuttiest stuff and accepting anything that comes out of the White House as gospel. Anything left of OAN is is 'woke liberal propaganda'. They post and repost the social media garbage and if you dare point out the facts about it, you've just fallen for the liberal media's lies. I find myself more and more often saying, ""I love where I live but I hate living here.""",Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-07T13:33:56,3

"It was happening way before TDS. Rush Limbaugh, with his radio show and television show are what probably really started what we're seeing now. TDS was more an attempt of a response to that sort of stuff. I was fairly conservative in my youth and listened to a lot of talk radio and witnessed it going from 'people I kind of agree with' to 'these guys are nuts'. For example, early Limbaugh skewered a lot of conservatives, especially nanny state types who wanted to censor 'smutty media' and the like. This was when he had  a difficult time getting sponsors so came up with the fake stuff. Then he realized where his bread was buttered and dove in completely. And I'm not defending the guy; he was always a pompous asshat, but his transition from fairly middle of the road to extreme right-winger is kind of the precursor to what we're seeing now and opened the door for it.",Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-07T13:40:19,9
