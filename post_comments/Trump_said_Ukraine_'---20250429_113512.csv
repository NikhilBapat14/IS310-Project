"Trump talks about 'Russia's big war machine'   Jesus Christ I watch about 20 Russians being blown off electric scooters, motorbikes and scoobyvans with rubber nailed onto them and around 5 tanks down from 30 a day exploding with my daily morning coffee. Much slower now than ever.  Extra light entertainment is the ongoing tally of Russians shooting themselves in the head, [because Russian sometimes repeatedly] and  comedy stealth Russians under heat shield blankets that make them look like they're reading a book with a torch at a slumber party being obliterated at leisure in wide open fields by drones as they creep in full heatseeking sight.  Russia is far closer to collapse than Ukraine. Hard to tell which will collapse first at this stage, Russia or the US.",theretortsonthisguy,2025-04-29T12:37:18,5
