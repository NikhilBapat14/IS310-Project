I actually decided to watch a episode of his about 3 weeks ago. Because occasionally i like to see what the other side is saying. what stood out to me about Pool is he seems to have no depth of knowledge about the things he talks about not even enough to push his lies. I just do not understand what the appeal is to those who listen.,sedatedlife,2025-04-23T22:55:39,4

"Dude’s going bold and instead of owning it, he never takes the beanie off. It’s extra pathetic as he rants about how men should be “manly”, etc… Not to mention it’s a Presidential briefing and it also shows a lack of decorum. Even if we’re past that.",NapOwl,2025-04-23T23:26:59,10
