"Remember after the Nixon fiasco how every President since then has put all their investments into a blind trust to avoid the appearance of corruption?  That idea is quaint now. Trump is blatantly corrupt, he flaunts his grifting. Today's GOP is nothing like back then when they told Nixon to resign or they would impeach and remove him. Trump is openly and brazenly doing everything Nixon did and today's GOP just nods and kisses his ass.  Can he legally do it? Yes, he's a convicted felon, he's a confirmed fraud, he's liable for sexual assault, and the GOP still worships him. The Supreme Court elevated him above all laws. So of course he can do it.",billpalto,2025-05-09T08:22:02,93
"Rules lol   We’re in the dumbest timeline, the grift is off the charts. Do you not know anything about his crypto coin scams? He’s a multi billionaire from those alone.",Foojira,2025-05-08T19:36:24,146
"Sure he can. They also said they don't pay attention to the stock market and Ukraine war would be over.  You don't  believe any of it do you? It's amateur hour in DC.   Private Hegeseth is throwing planes into the Ocean, Vance is a jinx... nothing turned out to be true or good.",RCA2CE,2025-05-08T19:30:21,49
"In more reasonable times, Congress would be watching the president and giving him an incentive to not go too wild.  However, this Congress has decided they are not going to do anything to restrain the president no matter what he does.  So, yeah, he can say and do whatever he likes because the fact of the matter is that no one is going to stop him.  I’m going to go throw up now.",thatthatguy,2025-05-09T00:28:03,24
Remember when *any* act was made legal as long as it was in his official capacity?  Something something 1st Amendment?  Nothing would stick to ol' Donny J Teflon even if someone were willing to try.,HardlyDecent,2025-05-08T20:02:51,23

"Yes, it is legal.    Trying to argue that telling the nation as a whole to “go buy stocks now” is investment advice would get you laughed out of the courtroom and might even get you sanctioned for bringing a frivolous case. You’d need a far more specific statement to have even a prayer of getting a judge to find PC.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-05-08T23:51:46,7
Saying “buy stocks now” is not illegal unless it can be demonstrated he had had material knowledge that wasn’t public and used it to profit.,robotlasagna,2025-05-08T21:51:29,6
"To give you an actual answer, he’s not giving investment advice. He is promoting an action. If he promoted a particular company or fund then he would be giving advice.",mcgunner1966,2025-05-08T20:14:16,7
"I think the fact he isn't specifically advocating for a specific stock, its grey area leaning towards it being legal.",Medical-Search4146,2025-05-09T02:12:27,3

"There is no law that prohibits anyone, including an elected official or even the President, to encourage participation in the stock market. Simply saying ""buy stock"" is not considered investment advice. Investment advice would generally be advisement regarding specific stock, like ""buy Exxon Mobile stock"" or something like that. There are other definitional criteria too but this one is sufficient to exclude this as investment advice or anything similar.",UnfoldedHeart,2025-05-09T08:11:44,1

"my guess is he's doing it to give himself legal cover for having done it earlier.  This time it's not going to make anyone any money, and so he can say look, it doesn't work and so it's not a tool and I knew it wouldn't be and so it was OK the first time.",Bulawayoland,2025-05-09T14:52:47,1
"There is no entity on earth whose legal action against Trump would be respected or even acknowledged by the administration, its agents, or its supporters.",jabask,2025-05-10T01:06:48,1
Trump has done enough illegal stuff to receive a capital sentence. And since they didn’t do it to him he now does whatever he wants,Leather-Map-8138,2025-05-10T14:26:06,1

Law an order was disregarded on day one. There is literally nothing stopping the Trump regime from committing whatever crimes him and his sycophants desire. ,Colzach,2025-05-09T00:42:21,1
Nancy Pelosi bought stocks and then passed bills So she would be rich. Telling ppl to buy stocks generally is not a crime,zachariassss,2025-05-09T09:22:16,1
He is telling people to invest in non-specific American companies.  You want the president to do that.  It becomes a problem when he does a commercial for one company such as tesler or goya. Is it illegal? Probably.  Is anyone going to try and stop it? No.,Comfortable-Policy70,2025-05-09T15:02:54,0

Dumbest timeline? You realize nobody knew who was actually running the country the past four years. And give Trump credit at least he stuck to his promise on deporting the criminals who were here. And is cracking down on anti semitism,jmac31793,2025-05-10T13:25:55,1

It’s like people didn’t want to believe we actually put the president above the law so now they ask each and every time if he’s really allowed to just break the law.   Yes.   That’s what the Supreme Court said.,fox-mcleod,2025-05-09T14:10:52,9
"It has to be legal for it to be in an official capacity.  The terms have legal definitions codified into U.S. law.  The Supreme Court may or may not have realized this when they made the ruling, still doesnt change the law.",neverendingchalupas,2025-05-09T23:53:12,1

"Even if Trump had knowledge, wouldn’t it be a public declaration and therefore legal?  Illegal would be encouraging a group of insiders to trade in non-public information.

"Saying ""Buy stock, i am going to reverse the tariffs tomorrow"" would be pushing the boundaries.   Saying ""buy stock"" is not any more illegal than me telling you ""you should buy stock""",robotlasagna,2025-05-09T03:36:09,-4
Illegal would be:  1. Trump knowing something privileged about a companies earnings and buying in early.  or  2. Trump telling the public to buy shares in NVDA because they were going to get an exemption but not actually giving the exemption (manipulation).  The SEC is specific about when information is disclosed it goes out to everyone at once so everyone gets a fair shake.,robotlasagna,2025-05-09T03:34:40,6

Promoting and giving investment advice are two legally different things.  It's not deemed illegal because it falls into the same camp as promoting war bonds during WWII.,mcgunner1966,2025-05-09T08:40:59,0
