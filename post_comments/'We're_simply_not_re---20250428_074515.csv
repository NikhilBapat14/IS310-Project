"We arent ready? It's been 20 years. If that isn't a prime example of why the government is inefficient, I don't know what is.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-28T08:00:24,347
REAL ID = Voter ID.  Passport = Voter ID.  The groundwork is done. These lazy states need to get their shit together. It's been over 20 years.,BucDan,2025-04-28T08:40:58,94

Im not a fan of the real id bs. However people have had plenty of time to get one. I got mine a few months back. Besides a long wait at the dmv the process only took a few minutes. And all it is is one extra proof of residency.,Jurclassic5,2025-04-28T08:13:20,66
Remember when just your regular Driver's License was proof of your identity and legal status?

Then maybe just scrap the whole thing. What benefit is so great about a real ID when we're going along fine without it. Maybe focus instead on getting voter ID laws passed on a  federal level.,triggernaut,2025-04-28T07:54:29,6
"Here is the list of things the States have to do.  To implement the Real ID Act, states must:    Confirm that any existing identification document of the applicant issued by another state or territory is terminated.  Limit the validity of identification documents to eight years.  Implement background checks and fraud prevention programs for employees issuing identification documents.  Maintain an electronic database of identification documents issued, including driver histories and violations, and provide access to it to all other states and territories.  Seriously if they are not ready, there are more serious problems in the state.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T12:54:51,2

"The people in these states have nobody to blame but themselves. They elected corrupt lawmakers who didn't get it implemented in a timely manner. If they can't get it done in 20 years, can they ever get it done?   Georgia started implementing it in 2012, and currently has 99.9% compliance rate. SC had to change laws and started in 2018, but has achieved 62% compliance. Meanwhile, blue states like NJ are at 17%, and WA and PA are both below 30%. IL is at 30%.",Jondiesel78,2025-04-29T06:10:34,1
My license has been compliant for well over 10 years now. There’s no excuse for people to not be ready.,dottedoctet,2025-04-28T08:16:22,138
It really blurs the line between inefficiency and intentional noncompliance. The truth is that states resist Real ID because it's difficult/impossible for illegal aliens to obtain a Real ID. They like maintaining their lax ID standards so that illegal aliens are able to get driver's licenses allowing them to get by living illegally in the US more easily and theoretically be identified by law enforcement on traffic stops. The issue of course is when a state issues a genuine identification document with incorrect information. ,Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-28T09:38:35,22
I think that that’s why they’ve dragged their feet. Because real ID is the prerequisite for voter ID,dottedoctet,2025-04-28T09:19:41,40
This would work if either of those two options didn’t have a fee attached. The easiest way to bypass anti/voter ID arguments is to make the ID in question free and mandatory.,MCRNRocinante,2025-04-28T14:47:50,15
"I just got a passport card. The cost of a passport + passport card was less than the increased cost and frequency of renewals for real ID over the same period.  Regular license + passport card was cheaper, and it let's me go international. ",swd120,2025-04-28T08:23:17,30

Exactly. It has now because the law in my state to have one to travel and everyone is freaking out because the deadline is coming up and have been asked probably a dozen times if I have mine. It's shocking because I have had mine for probably 10 years now.,re3x,2025-04-28T09:41:59,16
"Mine isn't because I lived in IL and they never pushed it.  Just said renew online with no effort or consider doing your Real ID since you will need that in a few years.

Your statement wasn’t clear whether you got both a passport card and a book.   Also not sure what costs you’re talking about for real Id.

"This is incorrect.

"It is good for domestic air - and our states real id renewal is (or was at the time) 3 years.  Vs 5 for the regular one.

Problem with my wife was her birth certificate was a different name than her married name. Her married name was misspelled at the county level so when she got a copy of our marriage certificate her name was misspelled.
