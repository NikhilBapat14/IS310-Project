"Most of my family is MAGA, and they are all loudly praising this. They see anyone who would need Narcan as a hardened druggie, people who they WANT to die. They refuse to hear any of the hundred accounts that come out each month of people OD'ing on fent because it was mixed (accidentally or otherwise) into drugs that you otherwise can't physically OD on.",OnlyRise9816,2025-05-05T17:05:56,120
So Bondi claims she saved 280 million lives or whatever by taking fentanyl off the streets. Whereas narcan ACTUALLY saves lives in a real in practical way.   I work as a bartender downtown and have had to call EMS a few times for people that were comatose and unresponsive. They were all administered narcan. I have a kit in my car and every bar and restaurant I’ve worked at.   This is the most cost effective way to combat the fentanyl and opioid crisis going on right now.,Cobs85,2025-05-05T18:50:04,34

"On what planet should first responders not have NarCan? I think Trump just plain wants users to die.

I am so lucky that I had medical intervention and access to rehab. Folks with problematic substance abuse today are tomorrow’s doctors and professors and community leaders.  But folks need a chance to live before they can walk a path of recovery. We recovery - but need the freakin’ opportunity and sometimes that comes after a near deadly relapse.  12 Steppers have a whole chapter on this in the Big Book (“Working with others, Chapter 7) is specific on this phenomenon. “Working With Others” says to meet people at their lowest, when they’re desperate and ready. When folks are at their bottom and they’re broken and willing to listen. That’s when honest sharing and offering hope matters most.  This is just evil.
