"She is lying, of course.  “We believe …pricing is going to stay at about the same level as it is. Pricing changes in our industry at least monthly, and sometimes more frequently. We’re going to respond to the market.”  So, when other automakers raise their prices to reflect the tariffs, GM will 'respond to the market' by raising their prices, too.",travio,2025-05-04T14:41:40,94

Wha? Big business Motor Manufacturers swallow consumer taxes and in doing so give up a significant proportion of their profits? Never. The cost of tariff’s WILL be recouped from the consumer. It’s just a matter of what new guise (ie additional “charge”) the motor manufacturer sets up to recover them.,PapaGilbatron,2025-05-04T14:52:29,7

Mathematically how? Are the executives and shareholders going to take less? No.  So unless they cut costs they’re going to have to raise prices. This is just the CEO saying good things for Trump.,hmr0987,2025-05-04T16:40:57,4

"As if I would ever buy another one of their garbage vehicles ever again.   Currently own a GM vehicle that has had over $16,000 in warranty work. Timing cover gasket, valve cover gasket, catalytic converter, both front struts, and the transmission all replaced before 70,000 miles.   All the while I dealt with these repairs I had to be on the phone trying to get them to cover these repairs even though I purchased a warranty to cover myself in these circumstances.

GM car prices are already so high even if they lowered them 10% they would lose sales. Who is going to buy new cars when everyone is getting laid off in a few months when the boats stop showing up with products?,ToadP,2025-05-04T16:55:44,2

Someone should look into all the money they have been receiving from tax payers since they seems to be able to Stand on their own two feet,Genoblade1394,2025-05-04T17:50:25,1
GM has MSRP’s that are often ~10% higher than the final sales price. They could probably absorb the tariffs in a competitive market without changing MSRP but just reducing the discounting,Lie-Straight,2025-05-04T18:12:06,1
What about the dealerships !,Impressive_Ad_5614,2025-05-04T20:45:07,1
"I saw a commercial the other day, Subaru I think, where they promised to keep MSRP unchanged. Thing is, I bought my Subaru for below MSRP - I know a couple of years ago they were selling for above MSRP. Sounds like a game where the actual out the door price will go up by quite a lot, but the official MSRP will stay the same.",tdomman,2025-05-04T15:59:13,1

"They literally cannot raise the prices. The average person cannot afford a new car that will go up in price over 20-40+ percent.  They can try to raise the prices to match the tariffs, but expect a 60% + plunge in sales. That's probably being generous. This is what happens when the majority of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.",Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-04T15:01:30,14

"As someone that lives in Michigan and is surrounded by folks who worked or work for GM, this is nonsense.   Profit sharing checks will be almost nothing, they will continue layoffs, and prices will start climbing for their cars if the tariffs continue. Lack of profit sharing checks is a noticeable hit in the local economies too.   You can tell when they hit because certain places start printing money when life is good.",2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-04T16:04:02,6

They’d have to crunch the numbers. If they raise prices by 20% but lose 19% in sales then that’s a net gain of 1%. ,Juicybusey20,2025-05-04T15:11:12,11

"I wonder if they'll go with the same strategy that Sony/Microsoft are doing with video game consoles. They raised prices, but spread those increases globally, which would make sense if they're trying to recuperate the costs of tariffs without pushing that responsibility entirely on the US market. Companies know that American consumers cannot absorb the full cost of these tariffs, but they also can't afford to eat the full cost themselves either, especially not with shareholder demands. So I could see GM increasing prices across the board in order to keep their domestic prices in a more reasonable state.",Elevation-_-,2025-05-04T17:18:54,2

I don’t know what their European sales are - but if they levy an artificial price increase on opel and Vauxhall, Renault and Seat and Peugeot and VW aren’t necessarily going to do the same. VW at least has a presence in the US, but do you think they would increase the prices of brands like seat and skoda to spread the load?",geoken,2025-05-04T17:39:45,1

"Oh fuck this is not intuitive to me at all. It turns out there’s a formula for this: to figure out what percentage *decrease* in total sales you can sustain to make the same revenue given a price *increase*, the formula is (1/(1+x)) where x is the percentage increase. In this case, for a 20% increase you need to sell at least 83.3% as many units.  No idea why this is not more intuitive god really fucked this one up ",Juicybusey20,2025-05-04T20:56:56,1

"Revenue is basically the same as sales so your revenue is still going down 18%.   People are probably thinking more of the profit margin. Say my costs are $5 and revenue is $10, so I made $5 profit. If costs increase 20% (to $6) and revenue drops 20% (to $8) we end up with a profit of $2 and a 60% drop.  Now that's assuming companies raise prices by their costs, which many are going above and beyond resulting in higher profit margins.",Dewgong_crying,2025-05-04T17:50:03,3
"Yeah. It's tempting to think that an x% gain is equivalent to an x% loss, but they're not. Sure, a 1% gain is close to a 1% loss, but a 99% gain is drastically different to a 99% loss. Working with a logarithmic scale would make gains and losses match perfectly, but that would be even less intuitive for most people.",WolfKit,2025-05-04T21:25:45,1
