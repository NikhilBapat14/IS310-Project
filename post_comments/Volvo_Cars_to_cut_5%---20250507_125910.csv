"Heâ€™s actually in power because of the pure stupidity of the Democratic Party. Both elections were layups, they went out of their way to lose. This time they were nice enough to give him the Senate and House too. They did a great job keeping him in the news every day after he was out of office. It worked so well.   If only voters held them accountable instead of just bitching about Trump daily. Itâ€™s so pathetic they reelected Chuck Schumer as an extra fuck you to Dem voters because Dem voters have no backbone and the party knows it.   Like the GOP, itâ€™s all about them, not the voters. We know this because the two people who lost to Trump got completely crushed in previous primaries but were too narcissistic to simply listen to the voters and go away. See Hillary 2008 and Kamala 2020. She couldnâ€™t even make it to Iowa that year and turned California (her home state) redder than ever in 2024. Thatâ€™s pathetic.",MountainLife25,2025-05-07T21:09:19,-1
