"Also love how he acts like winning Alabama was this huge accomplishment lol. They vote R by default, they literally almost elected a convicted pedophile in 2017 all because he had an R next to his name. Even his doofus stooge Vance would win Alabama by default if he ran in 2028.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-05-01T19:31:12,126

"[Feb 13](https://www.al.com/news/2025/02/heres-how-much-nih-cuts-could-cost-ua-tuscaloosa.html)  > A rate cut at the National Institutes of Health could cost the University of Alabama $2.85 million annually and diminish funding for the University of Alabama in Huntsville as well, officials said... It hits especially hard at the University of Alabama Birmingham, the largest employer in Alabama. UAB officials estimate the cut could cost the institution about $70 million a year.
