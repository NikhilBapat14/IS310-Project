Awful headline...implying that Greenland could be bought if the US was respectful. ,css555,2025-04-28T05:37:42,11

"The US isn't moving against anybody. That's nothing but bluster talk from the biggest blowhard to come down the turnpike in many a year. Remember, a lot of this is a distraction to keep folks off the real task, which is fleecing their pocketbook and stealing billions.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-28T04:10:35,-6
And if the United States does move against you then there are a hell of a lot of people within the United States who will be moving against the United States.,Deinosoar,2025-04-28T03:56:28,6

"In Germany in the 1930s it also started with fleecing the poor, but that didn't keep it from escalating to conquering territory. Do not assume that it won't escalate in this situation as well.",Deinosoar,2025-04-28T04:27:31,9
I personally believe this was all theatre in the first place. Trump knew that Greenland wouldn’t just “hand itself over” and it’s the same thing with Canada.   This was done to break up the current ruling order and sow deceit. China and Russia are benefiting far too much from all of this for it not to be obvious.  If the US fails China is #1 - Why is our president doing everything in his power to weaken decades of progress? It looks like China is behind this if I’m being completely honest,Freezerpill,2025-04-28T11:10:17,1
Let’s hope that the US isn’t setting an example by giving Ukrainian regions to Russia that it can use to do the same to Greenland. Or Panama. Or Canada. Or…?,Alarming_Rate_3808,2025-04-28T07:12:55,1
