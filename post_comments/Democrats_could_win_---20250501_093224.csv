"Texan here - while yes, it could happen, we have some massive disadvantages to overcome.   First, the Texas Democratic Party is absolute dogshit. A bunch of cronies just making sure they all have jobs. They squandered all the momentum from Beto‚Äôs senate run in 2017, even leading to Beto himself doing poorly in his 2022 race for governor.  Second, the GOP has an absolute death grip on the state, in more ways than I can even count. Corrupt at every level, they use that power to disenfranchise and keep people from voting. Even if a democrat won fair and square, I highly doubt there would be anything close to a peaceful transfer of power. Everything happening in our government the last 100 days has been happening in Texas for decades and I don‚Äôt think people really grasp the level of corruption. Search Ken Paxton for some jaw dropping shit.  Third, we are the most gun crazy state in the union, full stop. We had 20+ children killed in Uvalde and no one even blinked.

"You got Ted Cruz all wrong, its understandable because you're either or both 1) a liberal 2) a human being with rational thought  Ted Cruz's is actually one of the hardest races to win in the country, he boasts a relative high approval rating among Conservatives and closeted conservatives that say they're independent but ends up voting conservative. I know this makes no sense because he's an obvious liar, a unlikeable slime of a being and downright malicious and cowardly, how could anyone like him? They don't, but what you dont get about Ted Cruz is that he is one of the most staunch and loudest proponent of the number #1 (and often only) of the conservative voter agenda: ""hurting the right people"", so he doesn't just gets the default ""he has an R next to his name"" vote, he does have people that want to vote for him precisely because of how vile he is, because Ted Cruz winning is a greater win for them over the libs who hate him, although they dont personally like him, they wouldn't have a beer with him or leave their children alone with him. That's how liberal voters think, but Conservatives don't vote this way. Just like Trump, they know he stinks but that means the libs have to smell it too. Add to this the fact that Blue Voters don't show up to vote as much as they can.  Cornyn on the other hand has favorable ratings that is consistent with just about any white old male that has an R next to his name which is like 30%ish. Republican voters don't care for him, many probably can't name you what he's done, but he gets the default R vote but there isn't anything in particular that inspires R voters to go out of their way to vote for him, the same way they do for Cruz.",Dreamtrain,2025-05-01T12:26:51,5

There‚Äôs a good chance to try and make gains there.   St. Charles county in Missouri was one of the few to get more liberal in the last election. And MO was a purple state not that long ago and routinely votes for progressive state initiatives.

"Counterargument: Trump has shifted the voter demographics pretty heavily to where Democrats are doing much better with voters who have college degrees, women, and those who are more engaged in politics and current events. Even the retiree/baby boomer demographic that used to be more Republican actually voted more for Harris this time around.  Meanwhile Trump's base is increasingly filled with lower educated voters, blue collar workers, and young to middle aged men. These groups tend to be ""lower information"" and don't usually vote as much except in presidential elections.  This means that for local/state/midterm elections which have lower turnout, Democrats actually have a slight advantage by having more voters who stay engaged. Democrats did decently well in the 2018 midterms, held on in 2022, and will probably do well in 2026.

So, maybe you're right, maybe there won't be a free and fair election - hell, even with just traditional GOP rat-fucking when in US history did you ever have a truly free and fair election? - but that still doesn't mean it won't be a winnable election.   Basically an uneven playing field is par for the course for Dems in your system. And this time it just needs to be a blowout, everywhere.

These are places that had been solid blue, many of which hadn't gone to Republicans in over 100 years. Trump also won Texan Asians and Latinos.   The whole premise of the new Democratic coalition was that Latinos and Asians were turned off by the white focused Republican Party and so would continue to be Blue voters. 2024 had completely upended that notion, the DEI rhetoric and focus on diversity was more alienating than welcoming, and they felt more at home with Trump despite all the dumb shit he says.",DangerousCyclone,2025-05-01T15:19:20,0

It isn't about ""just pay the major media networks and mass advertise to the whole State."" Try to do just that, and you are going to fail.

He won Texan Latinos and he won Texan Asians. These are Dem voting blocs, traditionally, and even in 2020 he was gaining with them. The problem is that working class Latinos and Asians are going towards Trump, and that is making is much harder for Democrats to win going forward.

We'll see how this whole trade war goes for him, maybe it'll usher in 20 years of Democratic dominance like with FDR, maybe it'll usher in a perpetual dictatorship.
