"Depends on how the rules are set up, but generally a quorum is ***at least*** a simple majority of representatives being present.",Zeddo52SD,2023-06-07T16:08:24,14
"Municipal employee here.  What you're describing is what we sometimes call a ""walking quorum"" and is something that, in my City at least, we work hard to avoid. Councilors and commissioners will accidentally have a quorum if you let them, so we try to cut it off.  There's the obvious innocent stuff, like people chatting before or after a meeting. For that we just have staff try to break them into smaller groups by pulling them aside to ask questions individually.   But a huge one we have to look out for is email chains. One person emails another, who emails another, and we accidentally end up with a quorum through email exchanges. ""Reply All"" can also be a huge problem if we forget to BCC board and commission members. Commissioner A may ask a question or make a comment about agenda item G.3, and since they are replying to all the other commissioners it's a violation of Open Meetings.  It's not always crystal clear what constitutes quorum, so we play it safe. If we're having an event, we'll invite commissioners on the same board to different time slots or ask them if they'd like to volunteer at different booths, etc. We always err on the side of caution.",chiliedogg,2023-06-07T23:25:40,8
"Quorum is whatever the ruling body defines it as. It's different in every situation.  >Even though the same information was passed between all 3, is that not a quorum?  No, that is not a quorum. Simultaneous meeting is a key element of a quorum.",pina_koala,2023-06-07T22:58:48,3
"I get that, but the problem I'm running into here is understanding the definition of the word 'present', particularly in a modern digital context.",theyusedthelamppost,2023-06-07T16:21:28,7
">But a huge one we have to look out for is email chains. One person emails another, who emails another, and we accidentally end up with a quorum through email exchanges.  an experience like that in my town is exactly what caused me to ask this question  Are there rules that define quorum for your city in regards to different types of digital communication?   Would you care to weigh in on the two example questions I posed in the original post?",theyusedthelamppost,2023-06-08T00:13:10,3
"Depends entirely on the procedural rules of the governing body. I can imagine a digital space being designated for official business and quorum being called, but it still depends on how regulated the process of calling for a quorum is or even conducting official business in a digital space.  You would have to look at the local procedural rules for the Akron council, in this case.",Zeddo52SD,2023-06-07T16:26:52,9
It's really a better question for a municipal attorney. I just pay it super safe with my commissioners. Last thing we need is a lawsuit over after a commissioner asking a clarifying question in an email when trying to prepare for a meeting.,chiliedogg,2023-06-08T14:55:20,3
so you are saying that each government body (such as a city council) should provide its definition of a quorum in its own policies? And the definition could vary from the next town over?,theyusedthelamppost,2023-06-07T16:28:24,3
"A quorum is a minimum number of representatives present needed to make the proceedings legitimate and recognized. Each legislative body sets its own quorum as well as the process for calling for a quorum. Sometimes the State overrides local government, but in theory each legislative body (and therefore each town or city council) determines its own rules of procedure.  So yes, quorums can change between towns unless an overarching law is in place that would preempt localities from regulating such procedural rules.",Zeddo52SD,2023-06-07T16:37:54,8
hm that's very enlightening. Thanks very much.,theyusedthelamppost,2023-06-07T16:47:16,2
"Quorums don't apply only to governmental bodies. Any body (institution, society, club, etc.) can define a quorum, if it so wishes. As u/Zeddo52SD wrote, each body can define it any which way it likes. There's no universal definition.",PaddyLandau,2023-06-10T10:29:47,3
"Also worth noting, a quorum is not “a violation” by itself. A quorum just defines whether enough people are present to conduct official business.",letusnottalkfalsely,2023-06-13T08:10:19,1
