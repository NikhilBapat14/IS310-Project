Call your senators and ask them to invoke a hold on the nomination of Ed Martin for D.C. US Attorney. He is more vengeful than Bondi. Karma will meet this administration.,Userchickensoup,2025-04-02T20:54:14,5

Trump used his time-warping executive power to go back and declassify those war plans with his mind before Pete drunk texted them to the group chat.
