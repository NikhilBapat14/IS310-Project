"Does this allow an adult, age 18, to purchase a pistol or only carry one if they have a conceal permit?",pcm2a,2025-04-21T15:57:24,3
"It is to purchase one. Currently if you are legally able to own a firearm you can carry concealed without a permit. There is a limited exemption to the carry concealed, not sure the exact details.  I can buy a firearm in TN in a personal purchase only needing to fill out a bill of sale which protects me against the firearm having been used previously in a crime or protect the previous owner if I use it in a crime. Otherwise got a few hundred bucks and I can buy just about anything I want or whatever the sale price is. Businesses still need to do background checks.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-21T18:19:59,2
"Thanks, I was hoping it was for purchase. Was just trying to figure out why the verbiage of the bill talked all about 18 and carry permits. Most of my pistol purchases have been person to person transactions in Tennessee!  Having the real permit gets you carry in more places, like parks, and also reciprocity in other states.",pcm2a,2025-04-21T18:45:23,1
