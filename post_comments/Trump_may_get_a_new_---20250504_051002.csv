Rubios going to go at some point. He's not quite sycophantic or brainless enough.,RedofPaw,2025-05-04T05:49:18,13
Yet another job Rubio can be inept at. Rubio is starting to look like he'd like to kill himself.,invalidpassword,2025-05-04T05:26:24,3
"Rubio would never EVER be here in AMERICA, if someone LIKE HIM ran Immigration 50 years ago.  LITTLE KNOWN FACT: Rubio declared any border-related actions EXEMPT from ""notice & comment"".  This is clearly unconstitutional but - like all Trumpinine gaslight ""declarations"" - will require court challenge:  [https://cis.org/Jacobs/Rubio-Declares-Most-Immigration-Actions-Exempt-Federal-NoticeandComment-Requirements](https://cis.org/Jacobs/Rubio-Declares-Most-Immigration-Actions-Exempt-Federal-NoticeandComment-Requirements)  [https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/dos-determines-immigration-apa-foreign-affairs-function](https://www.nafsa.org/regulatory-information/dos-determines-immigration-apa-foreign-affairs-function)  This is how they think they'll get around Due Process requirements for Deportation,  the secret tariff exemptions they're making for Trump cronies, etc.  HEY LIL MARCO -- Way to mock the Constitution, pull up the ladder, kidnap immigrants like your parents, and illegally imprison them in a brutal Penal Colony!  Your American Dream has been fulfilled!    Can't wait for this arrogant fascist coward to join Trump's gang of felons.  It'll be soon.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-04T07:04:57,3
Remember when The News was reporting the stuff that happened not making assed non-predictions about the future?      I think that was one of the features of a functioning democracy and it was wrong to let it go.,waspsnests,2025-05-04T07:42:40,2
"Aw, little marco and king crazy are best fwends. I guess rubio changed his mind from this; “Donald Trump, a con artist, will never get control of this party.”",Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-04T06:58:16,2
Rubio is gonna wind up doing all of the jobs (but only getting paid to do one of them) by June so Trump can throw even more money at his hateful military birthday parade.,greyhoundbrain,2025-05-04T07:24:50,1
The Cuban Collaborator,yorapissa,2025-05-04T07:28:59,1
Is he getting 2 paychecks now?,Limberpuppy,2025-05-04T10:06:04,1
don’t say things like you are surprised he’s such a lackey and that he is on team hitler  he’s always been a low intelligence dweeb who would say whatever the current masters tell him to say,GreenAd7345,2025-05-04T10:29:31,1
Right.      Because Trump never knows anything.      Recession? Anything can happen   Due process? My lawyers know about that   Follow the constitution? I don’t know,hospitallers,2025-05-04T12:17:00,1
You give him way too much credit,GreenAd7345,2025-05-04T06:39:48,9
I wish there was some point where the court could issue an order where he is forced to get permission before anything he says goes onto effect.,MoreRopePlease,2025-05-04T22:48:27,2
"Probably. But he's not like hegseth, or others. He has some small sliver of shame left. You can see him cringing sometimes. He falls in line, but he doesn't like it much.   It's why he will eventually be gone.",RedofPaw,2025-05-04T06:44:30,5
You can literally see the soul leaving his body these days. I cannot imagine he can face his extended family after all he’s said against birthright citizenship.  He literally is birthright citizenship.,SassySauce75,2025-05-04T07:24:46,9
please don’t set the bar so low  they are alll miserable bootlickers  would you give credit to one concentration guard for not screaming as loud as the other one?,GreenAd7345,2025-05-04T06:46:02,2
"Right? He's doing all the awful things, going along with every part of the racism, but he's not loving every single moment of cruelty inflicted. He's not gleefully sadistic. He's a coward.",RedofPaw,2025-05-04T07:27:04,4
I'm not giving any credit.  I'm giving a reason why Trump will eventually tire.  He will follow orders and smile along. But he's not like some who are true believers.,RedofPaw,2025-05-04T06:58:16,2
