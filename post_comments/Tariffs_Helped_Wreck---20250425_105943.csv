"Ok here’s the deal for anyone who hasn’t been awake for the last few decades:  Trump doesn’t care about immigration, or tariffs, or Canada, or NATO, or Greenland or Ukraine. He had two objectives this term: 1. Stay out of jail 2. Distract everyone from the fact that he’s going to steal everything that isn’t bolted down to the bedrock.   Understand now?",Responsible-Room-645,2025-04-25T12:04:34,8
"Tariffs might win applause at rallies, but history keeps proving they lose in practice. Smoot-Hawley crushed farmers. Now “Liberation Day” is bleeding manufacturers. Different century—same mistake.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-25T11:01:52,4
"Because Donnie von Shitzinpants is a very dumb person, with learning disabilities.  He can't understand history.",BioticVessel,2025-04-25T11:02:04,6
"Tariffs are hurting you.  The average peasant.  it is not hurting him or his inner circle.  they are making insane amounts of money on things and if you look at the very very fine print you will see the exemptions exist on certain items for a reason.  Why pay full price for anything when you can pay pennies on the olldar for it after it all falls apart?  As for why is he making the same mistake...he isn't.  He's doing it intentionally, it's the voters and supporters in your nation making the same mistake",TrashedLeBlanc,2025-04-25T11:20:54,5

It’s on purpose and not a mistake.  It’s a shakedown. Shifting ownership and power to the inner circle.,VantageZero,2025-04-25T11:07:07,2
