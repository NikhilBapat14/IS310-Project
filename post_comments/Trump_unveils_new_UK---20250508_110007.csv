First trade deal with our closest ally.  That is a good start.  Hopefully more will be done sooner rather than later.,mdws1977,2025-05-08T11:26:44,87
Hopefully more zero tariff deals❗️I'm hoping an India trade deal will come soon.  Imagine 20 of the USA's biggest trade partners (outside of China) having zero tariffs and very little non-tariffs.  This will turbocharge the global economy.  Just the EU and USA alone (with close to zero tariffs and non tariffs barriers) is a big step.,GiediOne,2025-05-08T12:38:48,28
"Fantastic news.  We keep 10% tariffs on imports from the UK while steel and aluminum get a special 0% rate (likely to help offset lost imports from Canada).  UK reduces tariffs to an average of 1.8% on imports from the U.S., commits to buying more beef and ethanol, and $10 billion of Boeing aircraft.   Achieves exactly what Trump wants - more money for American businesses.",dunkeater,2025-05-08T13:51:44,6

"I’m waiting for all the “fellow conservatives” to flood this sub and tell us why this is the worst trade deal ever and that they totally raked us, even though 1) it’s an objectively solid deal and 2) the markets loved it",superduperm1,2025-05-08T11:28:43,86
The rest of Reddit is already (predictably) sh\*tting all over this.   The most popular seem to be:   \- It's not an actual deal   \- Things were fine with global trade before Trump f-ed everything up   \- This was all just a scheme by Trump for his buddies to get rich off the stock market,PartyOfFore,2025-05-08T12:03:38,57
It's hardly the worst deal ever.  It balances out to only about 1.8 billion in increased costs for Americans via tariffs once it's all said and done.,cathbadh,2025-05-08T12:32:22,19
Its better than what we had before and we kept a 10% tarrif still. Thats undeniably a win no matter how you slice it.,ultrainstict,2025-05-08T18:03:37,5
"So nothing that actually has anything to do with the deal itself? Interesting. Almost like these were a set of canned (and inaccurate) talking points ready for them to spit out and parrot whenever we agreed to any kind of deal (which they spent the last month insisting Trump would never do, btw).",superduperm1,2025-05-08T12:20:27,28
"$1.8 billion per day? Per month? Per year?  With a population of over 340 million, that’s a funny way of saying less than $6 more per person which really isn’t all that much. I don’t know about you but I can afford an additional $6 per year.",superduperm1,2025-05-08T13:12:34,6
"Per year.  And that's assuming they don't choose to eat the costs on some of the things.  The $6 per American is a little misleading as most Americans don't buy their products.  It'll mostly be born by the 100k people who buy cars from there.  But this one was always going to be minor considering we actually had a trade surplus with them.  The rest of the world can more or less look at this and realize that they won't get deals as good as this one.  Regardless, there was always the option of just not tariffing this ally, not raising prices for any Americans, and sticking to conservative economics.",cathbadh,2025-05-08T14:18:55,26

Was just having a discussion at lunch today how we don't really see recent vintage land rovers as used cars a lot.,xterraadam,2025-05-08T17:30:48,1
Exactly. Tariff the shit out of them. It's literally free money,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-08T22:20:59,-8
