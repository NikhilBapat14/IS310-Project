"""A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.""  Seems as though the new Pope has got his shit figured out.

"I am not Catholic. When I read his homily, I didn't take it as a loss of faith in the Catholic Church. I took it as a​ loss of faith in God. His message actually resonated with me on an overall Christian level.",Theloripalooza,2025-05-09T14:15:35,72
"This could be what a Catholic priest is referring to at times, but at least in the context of the article he wasn’t. He was talking about Christian faith, Jesus and the gospels.",RotoDog,2025-05-09T13:19:51,59
