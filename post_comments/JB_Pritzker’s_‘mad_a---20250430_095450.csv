"Rank and file Dem leadership seems to have missed the point that, as leaders, their actions can give people a sense of imagination and permission to hope and act. The regime captured all the branches of government, but we're not dead, and nobody should be rolling over.   There are a handful out there doing the good work of saying important and meaningful things out loud when so many are becoming fearful. We are a far more ferocious population than the propaganda would have you believe.",BarbaGramm,2025-04-30T11:37:00,103

It's good we have ""angry"" Dems out there that are willing be visibly angry, but there are also Dems who take action, Dems who speak quietly but with facts and reason, Dems who can legislate, Dems who can rally voters, Dems who can communicate with or without appearing mad, etc..  It takes all kinds to reach all kinds of people, because some are receptive to the mad as hell types, some are not.

Lots of talk about 2028.  This is something that has always interested me about Americans.  You're always talking about the next election.

This is a really good point that isn't expressed very often.  Democrats aren't in lock-step like MAGA types and they respond to different things.  There's room for all forms and styles of persuasion from all sorts of different Democrats.  The real problem is getting to hear about what they're doing from a MSM that isn't interested in reporting it unless it's loud and chaotic.,lilacmuse1,2025-04-30T22:37:57,1

FDR was from wealth and was considered a class traitor.  Let's not pretend it wouldn't be easier to get a billionaire elected than someone from the grass roots.   I'm not saying he should be the chosen one but he's in the running and him having a billion dollars also means he could tell the DCCC and all the penny pushers in the party to fly a kite.,Big_Mud_6237,2025-05-01T14:58:22,3
">the billionaire thing makes people leery  It's people who can't stop and think. Billionaire is bad. It's not a deal breaker. It's not failing a purity test. It is reality.  Those same people could pick Bernie or AOC or Kevin the intern or someone at Starbucks making coffee. It does not matter who it is. What does matter is that they lead. What does matter is that all the not-Republicans follow their lead. What does matter is come vote time is that all the not-Republicans vote for the same person.  All the whiners can't fix a problem when they don't know what the problem is. A person having fuck you money who potentially can't be influenced by bribes is a good thing. Not a bad thing.   >the billionaire thing makes people leery  Then don't fucking vote for him. But do listen to what he has to say and follow his lead. Or, you can follow Schumer' lead or Pelosi's lead. We need a leader. We don't need people painting bicycle sheds.",tech57,2025-05-01T06:39:58,2
