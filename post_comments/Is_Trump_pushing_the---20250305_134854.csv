"UNLESS Donny Bonespurs destroys the Dollar, can't see anything changing. Simple reason, there's not enough of any other currency to handle the traffic. Slightly more complex reason - too many countries treat the Dollar like gold - it's what's supporting their own currency, so abandoning USBucks for anything else has a serious downside.",Olderscout77,2025-03-09T16:11:33,6
"""The petrodollar"" is a bullshit story. Oil is traded in US dollar because it is stable, not the other way around.  Not even Trump can stop the dollar from being the main reserve currency but he might wreak enough havoc to make room for the Euro to also be one.",AntonDahr,2025-03-09T18:10:43,2
Itâ€™s stable for now. The dollar is not god.   You are taking the dollar for granted,96suluman,2025-03-09T18:43:22,0
