Pros:  1. We free up somewhere around 4-5% of our GDP to spend on other things if you assume we spend a similar amount as other wealthy countries.

"Public health official here with a good amount of experience studying and analyzing foreign health systems, and now working in the US (I'm American).  We'd have better health outcomes. We'd eliminate one of the biggest sources of personal debt (maybe the biggest) in the country, and while I'm not an economist, I assume the economy would improve. We would be better addressing health outcomes for underserved groups, we'd be able to meet the health needs for those who are otherwise using our emergency systems, freeing them up and reducing wait times, and we'd be a healthier society overall.   Our taxes would go up, but depending on how much you spend currently on healthcare and insurance, that might mean paying less for you.  Lobbyists, insurance execs, and many within these systems would no longer have a job. I don't see how that's a bad thing. Doctors would make less, but many have compelling arguments that they are already overpaid. That's a discussion for another conversation. Pharma companies would, in theory, be forced to give us the same pricing other countries receive for drugs.  The cons? Well, first is that we don't really know how to do it in the ""best way"". No country has perfected it. France has a great system on paper, but satisfaction sometimes varies on location. They are working on that. The system of the NHS in the UK is set up well, but gets tied up in bureaucracy that makes it cumbersome to deal with and sometimes not the best place to work. There are many other countries that have single payer or universal healthcare and do it well. Again, nobody does it perfectly. We cannot simply re-create another system. We'd need to build our own.",BrandonLouis527,2025-03-19T10:24:03,6

"We do not need to get rid of Medicare and Medicaid.. We just need to expand those programs for everyone. They are already programs that work. The poor, the sick, the vets and the old for the most part get government healthcare. It's the hard working folks in the middle who get stuck in the crappy insurance system. People with chronic conditions who can't work fulltime, get trapped in the disability system where in order to get healthcare they can't really have a job. If we had a for everybody system they could work even if it was just part time.  At one point I did the math on this, between Medicare, Medicaid Chip, disability, the VA, and folks who work for federal, state and local government about 2 out of 3 people are already getting taxpayer funded healthcare.

"I’m so glad you introduced this topic!  Universal single payer healthcare is a brilliant idea. Research how other countries have designed public healthcare systems. No two are exactly alike and some are more successful than others. There is usually a role for private insurance coverage, kind of like Medicare advantage policies, but not exactly. Everyone would have to pay into the system. Everyone would have access to basic care. Those with advantage type plans would have reduced deductibles. Individuals and families could opt for private only plans and be exempt from paying into the system. Freedom of choice would have to be central as this is America after all.   All healthcare provider positions would have to be salaried - including doctors, etc. Doctors, nurse practitioners, etc would not have to wait for insurance payouts, but would be required to manage a minimum patient load. I have no idea what’s reasonable with regard to salary or patient load. Oversight would have to be built in.   Healthy lifestyles education and preventative care would have to be funded to keep costs of care from skyrocketing.   How much would it cost? A lot. But Americans already pay more than the citizens of any other country with poorer outcomes. A wealth nation like the US should have the lowest infant mortality rate and highest longevity rate and healthiest citizens. Sadly that is not the case. There’s something fundamentally wrong with our current system.",Curiosity-0123,2025-03-18T20:32:04,3
"It would be really difficult to fully fund to begin with. Honestly, people don't realize how expensive it would be. It will require a slow transition over the course of multiple administrations.  A smart way to find it would be for the US to dump $1T/year for multiple years into an index fund and use the income from it to pay for everyone's healthcare. This is a similar system to how Australia funds social programs in general. That index fund will continue to grow and could be extremely beneficial.  Military needs to lose about $200B immediately and probably absorb/nationalize health insurance companies.",Pale-Candidate8860,2025-03-18T23:06:30,3

"The idea that EVERYONE will wait months for an MRI is ridiculous. I'll tell you what happens.   My wife (A U.S. Doctor MD, Primary Care physician) got very sick in Portugal, we went to the ""private"" hospital ER. She saw a doctor, had an xray done, got a prescription. We were in and out in about 2 hours. The ""catch"" was we had to pay up front before she would be seen. Our total for that ER visit was about 250 Euros. That same visit in the U.S. without insurance would have cost someone 3000 USD or more out of pocket, someone with ""Good"" insurance would have had to pay their ER co-pay, or whatever they had left on their deductible.   2 months earlier our friends were in Spain and had an accident on a scooter they rented. They didn't know how hospitals work in Europe so they just went to the nearest ""public"" option that was cheaper. At most the one friend had some bruises on her toes. They waited 10 hours and never got seen, they ended up leaving and we're sent a bill in the mail for something like 20 Euros.   What would really happen if we adopted universal health care is we would have a 2 tiered system. Yea the free public option might suck, but we would still have the option of private hospitals, and private insurance. Overall cost would go down across the board for people who choose the more expensive private option, or if people still went the ""universal"" route.   The reason why costs would go down across the board is because of efficiencies gained by not having too many competeting interests, all trying to operate for profit.   If you broke your arm on a ski vacation in Colorado, but you live primarily in Florida, the private for profit hospitals , or the public universal hospitals would be using the same data entry, patient management software which is NOT standardized in the U.S. You wouldn't need to waste administrative time/resources (cost) filling out forms every damn visit, release consent forms, etc etc. That is just 1 example of resources (time) saved.",Due_Ad1267,2025-03-18T17:01:57,2

"There are different forms of it.   What we've seen in the UK and Canada is free basic coverage for everyone which has benefits of less debt and more access, but it's much more difficult to see specialists and get surgeries. I'm not sure how it would impact things like pharma companies and innovation. Would there be more push to discover cures for illnesses instead of just medication to treat them for life?   I'm not sure how it would impact people who have rare disorders and require constant specialist care, is this better or worse for them?  I think one of the biggest benefits would be removing a lot of involvement of insurance companies, which are just middle men that drive up prices incredibly high.   I think there has to be a great middle solution where you retain innovation and specialist access and decent wait times, but lower costs so that no one is ever financially doomed by a health issue they didn't ask for.

"\>What would be the pros and cons of replacing Medicare, Medicaid, and other health programs with universal healthcare coverage? Could the payroll tax alone cover the cost of this expanded program  No. Looking at it now, Medicare isn't bursting at the seams with trillions of extra dollars. Any remotely serious plan I have seen includes more tax to cover it.   There would be more people covered, and some people would end up with better coverage than they have. More care for more people helps lead to a healthier population overall most likely.  If you leave private healthcare open it probably becomes an instrument of the upper class specifically where top providers can make significantly more money catering to them.   It would also put healthcare power in the hands of the federal government. I know people will say that in countries with universal healthcare the patient still gets to make the decisions, but there is always a line. That is disconcerting to some.

"*How would this shift affect the role of private health insurance companies, and would they still have a place in the healthcare system?*  Many universal healthcare systems have some sort of private or non-profit secondary payer that comes in behind the government primary payer.  Single-payer is one form of universal healthcare, but dual-payer is probably better suited to what would work for Americans.  You could take a version of the existing Medicare system, make it the primary payer and price setter across the board, then have a marketplace for secondary payers who serve largely as customer service organizations while covering the financial gaps and keeping the hypochondriacs from blowing up the system.  The key to the system is having a primary payer that has leverage in price setting.  The problem with the US system is the power of providers to pick and choose what insurance they will accept, which has the effect of driving up provider fees that in turn leads to higher premiums.  But this needs to be supplemented by other tools for reducing operating costs, such as increasing the number of physicians, allowing nurse practitioners to do more of the basic work and empowering pharmacists with the authority to write prescriptions so that they can serve as the first line of defense.  The French keep their costs down by having a 24-hour pharmacy always operating within a given location, served by a pharmacist who can provide medications.  This keeps many patients away from more costly providers.",I405CA,2025-03-20T22:32:14,1

"There is a very real possibility that Universal Healthcare, in the hear and now in the US, will actually lead to no change or worse service from healthcare facilities. Americans make poor health choices. We eat poorly. We exercise rarely. We like to drink and smoke. We like fat and sugar. We are fat. I am assuming this because I don't care to provide data but I think they are safe assumptions, generally.   And because Americans make poor health choices that means universal healthcare will not have the benefits that people think that the change will make. Yes, some people may get access when they wouldn't normally have that access. I don't deny that. But they are just replacing people who would have had those slots by private insurance. The new coverage wont make more hospital beds. It wont make more nurses. And it wont make more doctors. There is only a certain number of slots for appointments and there are only a certain number of beds available. Who gets those slots and beds may be more equitable but the access levels are going to be the same. Or it may get worse as more people are going to be vying for those slots and beds.   And universal healthcare is supposed to bring healthcare costs down. So there should be less money to make more beds. It would mean paying nurses and doctors less as well.   Overall it will be more equitable. Maybe? I am not sure I buy that more people will access the system given the stubbornness of Americans. The poor wont have the patience needed. And the people who know how to work systems will have it easier, especially if they have the time to give attention to their care. The rich and the near rich will be completely unaffected accept for the new taxes.   Really, universal healthcare is a Band-Aid to the real problem. People need to take better care of themselves and have less issues by examples like they choose not to smoke or choose to exercise more. Once Americans are healthier, then universal healthcare will see benefits because not as many people will be vying for those beds and slots. If we ate like the Japanese or exercised like the Dutch, then maybe. But we don't. For now, right now, it is a waste of money and effort.",hallam81,2025-03-18T16:13:06,2

"That’s another side of it, as well. But there are a few answers here. First off, if you eliminate the profit imperative, you are changing the calculus, because the facility only needs to make as much money as it takes to support itself, without regard for it being a return on investment.   What you discuss is something that happens. People routinely go to a smaller hospital in some out of the way place, get stabilized, then evacuated to a “better” hospital. So that’s already occurring.  The problem is that you still need competent facilities close to people’s spaces, because you can’t just drive a lot of people an hour into the closest city when they’re having a heart attack or they’re in a diabetic coma or whichever it is.   Now, I think the long term solution is that we just let those areas continue depopulating naturally.   Changes in the economy have made many areas simply unnecessary for people to live.

">when and where they need them, *without financial hardship*.   When did it become considered a financial hardship to have a job in the US 🤔 I know I've been gone a long time, but things have changed more than I realized.  It qualifies as universal healthcare because the population has universal access to it. Everyone who works has an affordable policy. Anyone who does not have a job have access to government benefits through their social security number which pays for their access to health insurance until they are employed again. Even in the near zero chance a person does not have a health insurance policy for some strange reason (maybe an American tourist without travel insurance), the cost of medical services is a small fraction of what they are in America. I could pay for my medication out of pocket if I absolutely had to, which I don't. The same medication would have cost me several hundred dollars for a 1 week supply. I know because I had to pay it at one point.   So again, *universal* healthcare.  To get back to my original point, your overall share of income for your policy in your salary is going to be somewhat higher than what it would be in the US, but I am discussing a matter of maybe 5% last I checked (a couple weeks ago).

There was no reason to me or the Dr. after being on hold for over two hours (that’s about the avg wait time for medi-cal they told me it was because the Dr did not provide the information that the medication was necessary.   Medical has a pre authorization system called TAR for some medications.   The Drs office told me that they did provide all information requested and that medi-cal typically denies the first TAR request automatically and subsequent requests go to through the TAR review process.  This TAR review process can take weeks. I went through it and got a notice in the mail that the TAR was denied because the provider did not provide information that the medication was necessary.   The provider did and this has happened before with other providers. And I’ve talked to other people on medi-cal and they have gone through the same thing.   The mind numbing thing about the denial of the TAR this time is that this is a medication I was already on but am simply getting a higher dose.

If he said he lived in a country where everyone had healthcare literally anyone paying attention would know it's not the United States.  And you blocked me as well lol.

"Depends on which one you're talking about, since I can't even nail down what data set you're using since you refuse to look at it.  The metrics haven't changed since the Warren study 15 years ago.

"It only came to be that way because of [an explosive report from the Surgeon General in 1964](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3894634/).  >The 1964 report of the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee marks the beginning of a significant shift in public attitudes about smoking... Adult per capita consumption has declined by about 70% since 1963, the year before the Surgeon General’s report.  Interesting! That appears to be a landmark date in the reduction of smoking.  >The 1964 Surgeon General’s report received widespread media coverage and prompted a decline in cigarette sales in the first two months following its release. In 1966 the first cautionary label appeared on cigarette packs, stating that cigarette smoking “may be hazardous to your health”.  Seeing some immediate actions from the federal government here based on that federal report. I wonder if there are any other contributing factors?  >Cigarette ads were banned from television and radio in 1971...The public perception of smoking about this time began to shift, making smoking a less acceptable social practice. A poll conducted in 1966 found only 40% of Americans recognizing smoking as a major cause of cancer, while 27% said it was a minor cause and one-third said the science was not yet able to tell. In 2001 Gallup re-asked this same question and found 71% of Americans naming smoking as a major cause of cancer, with 11% saying it was a minor cause and 16% unsure.  So one of two things are happening here. The federal government stepped in as a non-profiting entity to raise public health awareness, and then act on that collected data in the best interest of the country, directly and intentionally causing knowledge about the dangers of smoking and its impact on those around you. A prime and motivating factor in the social stigma of smoking.  The other thing that could be happening here is what you seem to be proposing: public sentiment shifted because... uh, well, let's not get into it? It just... kinda happened on its own? Maybe aliens beamed the idea into our heads at the exact same time that these reports, policies, and laws came into place in a beautiful coincidence of public health?",xXxdethl0rdxXx,2025-03-20T14:32:07,1
"Many people buy insurance out of fear of catastrophe, and then never actually use it in order to save money.  Many people have insurance but simply don't go to the doctor or buy meds unless it's an absolute emergency.  Many of those people aren't spending anything on medicine per month except for their premium.  You're talking about *average* costs, and I'm talking about the millions of people *at the bottom of the distribution*.  Of those people, many can *barely* afford their premiums, and then *barely* ever actually go to the doctor, but they keep the insurance because they don't want to get wiped out if they have an emergency.  Then there are millions that simply can't afford the premiums and so they go without.  If you raise the cost of premiums, many of those people that could barely afford them will also go without.  The way to ""fix"" the system is to have health care costs billed at progressive rates, where poor people basically get healthcare for free, and rich people pay more than their share.  It's more complex to do this for insurance premiums than it is to *use the already existing progressive tax systems that exist in most countries.*  Tax rich people more, tax poor people less, and then use tax revenue to give everyone ""free"" healthcare (paid by taxes).  Then no one has to worry about whether they can afford access to healthcare.  That's true ""universal healthcare"".",ZippyDan,2025-03-20T00:41:22,1

"It doesn't matter if it's the 2007 study or the 2022 study (66.5%). A substantial number of people who have declared bankruptcy did so at least in part, to medical bills.     You can say they only ha $50 in medical all you like.     You can say people who died in auto accidents were coded as Covid deaths.

">Of those people, many can *barely* afford their premiums, and then *barely* ever actually go to the doctor, but they keep the insurance because they don't want to get wiped out if they have an emergency.  This is the difference between where I live and where I'm from in America. I never went to the doctor until I had to for this exact scenario. Here I can go to the doctor any time I want because I have no additional costs other than my monthly premium. I've had double hand surgery which would have cost at least 10k stateside *as a copay*. If I lost my job, there is a government safety net that grants me health insurance until I have another job which will help me pay for another policy (which is every single job you can legally get here).  >The way to ""fix"" the system is to have health care costs billed at progressive rates, where poor people basically get healthcare for free, and rich people pay more than their share.  You don't need graded costs. You simply need reasonable rates and anybody can afford if they're working a job, and a safety net for people who cannot or are between jobs. The system works everywhere else in the world without the payment scheme you describe. You're needlessly complicating something that is very simple.",krustytroweler,2025-03-20T00:58:30,1
