"Some tidbits,    > Trump has tried to get Xi on the phone a number of times since he returned to office, but the Chinese leader has, so far, resisted. Beijing wants to see a number of steps from Washington before it will agree to trade negotiations, including showing more respect and naming a point person for the dialogue, Bloomberg News previously reported. >  > Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong earlier Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing dismissed speculation that progress has been made in bilateral communications, saying “any reports on development in talks are groundless,” and urging the US to “show sincerity” if it wants to make a deal. “The US should respond to rational voices in the international community and within its own borders and thoroughly remove all unilateral tariffs imposed on China, if it really wants to solve the problem,” he said. >   >The remarks from China’s commerce and defense ministries came hours after Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, warned of the threat ongoing frictions posed to trust in the global economic system, during Chinese officials’ first trip to the US since Trump unleashed his biggest tariffs yet.  >“All parties should strengthen cooperation and make efforts to prevent the global economy from sliding into a track of ‘high friction, low trust,’” Pan said at a Group of 20 meeting in Washington on Wednesday, according to a social media post by state broadcaster China Central Television.  > Pressed on which administration officials were involved in discussions, the US president said, “it doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning, and we’ve been meeting with China.”   >  > The US leader said Wednesday that “everything’s active” when asked if he was engaging with China and that Beijing was “going to do fine” once talks had settled. >  > Trump shifted his tone yet again on Thursday, criticizing Beijing for refusing to take deliveries of Boeing Co. jets and for its role in the trade of illegal fentanyl. The US imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports tied to fentanyl before slapping them with an additional 125% duty.  >  Trump was at his golf course on the 24th and will back at his other golf course the 27th.",tech57,2025-04-26T11:56:00,2

"*From Bloomberg News contributor Samm Sacks*  Amid deep division in Washington, fear of the rise of China is one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans agree on; another is that economic security is national security.  But the case of Huawei suggests sweeping trade restrictions are an ineffective policy that is fueling — not foiling — advances in China’s domestic technology in ways that could shift the global market.

"> Trump has tried to get Xi on the phone a number of times since he returned to office, but the Chinese leader has, so far, resisted.   According to the President of the United States, he has spoken to China's President Xi multiple times. Do you believe America, the leader of the free world, or China, a communist country?",xibeno9261,2025-04-26T13:28:58,-2
"Why believe when you don't have to?  Trump Tariffs Like 'Delinquent Kid Extorting Somebody'—Japanese Lawmaker   https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-delinquent-kid-extorting-somebody-japanese-lawmaker-2061460    >Oguma in a speech during a parliamentary committee hearing told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that the nation should resist Trump's demands, likening the U.S. approach as a ""delinquent kid extorting someone,"" according to a Times of India translation.  >""If Japan listens to this and bends the other way in response to the impossible demands of bargaining and deals, it will set a bad example as a customary and historical precedent,"" Oguma said. ""If you get mugged and put money in their hands, they will come back to mug us.""  >Oguma called Trump's tariff formula ""a mess"" and questioned if it was ""safe for a serious person to go there"" and negotiate with the U.S.  >""Consider every option, but you should never make concessions to someone who is not straight up anyway,"" Oguma said, adding: ""I hope that you will never give in to the American extortionists. I know this is harsh to say, but they are extortionists.""  >""If you listen to what they say, it will be a really bad example,"" Oguma said.  >Iwaya meanwhile has called for a diplomatic approach to the still-developing U.S. trade policy, comparing the regular changes to ""a daily menu."" He previously called the tariffs ""regrettable,"" according to Japanese outlet Kyodo News.  Japan Minister Speech | Japanese Leaders Attack Trump's Tariffs: 'US Tariffs Change Like Daily Menu'   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvDCtYgv9wI  See Richard Quest's reaction to Trump advisers' tariff remarks   https://youtu.be/ajepCm-mYUE?t=79     Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world. The U.S., meanwhile, is standing in the cold, holding a clipboard and wondering where the magnets went.",tech57,2025-04-26T13:45:13,2
