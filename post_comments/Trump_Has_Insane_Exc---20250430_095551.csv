Is anything he says not insane?

I’m sure Trump also blames Biden for his previous failed marriages were also the fault of Biden.,Broke-Till-Payday,2025-04-30T09:59:38,8
"Yes, the Market is cratering because 10 months ago Biden tried to forgive student debt. That has to be the reason.   ... I work in manufacturing, and every single one of my suppliers is holding their import orders. Every single one. Holding cloth, machines, spare parts, lights, tables, components, everything. It is a fire sale on inventory that is still in the US right now, but none of them are bringing anything in, because that would be insane.   We brought in a machine that cost $14k. It had duties of $23k on it. Absolutely nobody is going to stock their inventory with $14k machines that have a landed cost of \~$38k (Assuming 1k in shipping), because when Trump inevitably caves, those machines are going back to $14k (Or more likely about $18-20k...). Yeah, that can't possibly why the economy is cratering. Because the rules are changing every freaking hour, and nobody can plan even the basic functions of their business out past the weekend.",SamtheCossack,2025-04-30T10:10:52,6

"it ceased to be be Biden’s stock market when he caused it to crash with the Tariff fiasco. If he had just left it alone and it continued to do well, does anyone not believe that he would call it his stock market.   This only accepting good things and blaming others for the bad has gotten really old.   It also has a big downside in that there isn’t much at all that he can take credit for under these ridiculous rules of his, so this is an outright admittance that he hasn’t been effective at all in anything that he’s touched and the multiple polls only reinforce that.   Everything he touches turns to shit, and you can take his word for it because if he blames someone else, then he fucked up. And, what he claims as accomplishments were either put in effect prior to him taking office or is simply just another lie that can be easily disproved. He honestly would be better off just admitting that he doesn’t have any idea what he’s doing and is just winging it from day to day with no thoughts about the effects of his reckless actions.   How about a class action suit against him and Musk from all of the American people with any stock market based investments for gross negligence and asking for damages to return all their investments to the pre January 20th value plus interest and punitive damages plus legal costs? Can we show damages? No problem. Can he and Musk show no negligence due to actions on their part? That would be another shit show, so good luck on that.",Mike-ggg,2025-04-30T11:26:34,3

"Under normal circumstances he would be correct, the first few months of economic figures under a new admin would be more related to the policies of the previous admin.  But it is very plain to see that Trump has up-ended the US economy various ways, so there is no way this can be accurately pinned on Biden.    He has manufactured an economic crisis for absolutely no sane objective reason and is too much of a coward to own it.",Mala_Practice,2025-04-30T10:53:05,2
