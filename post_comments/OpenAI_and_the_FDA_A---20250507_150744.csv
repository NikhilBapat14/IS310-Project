"fuck no,  I use copilot daily and cant trust it to write a powershell without creating bullshit commands that don't exist.  I even had it list its own licensing info and features to find it missed features....   It is not ready for drugs.",trixster87,2025-05-07T15:13:13,25

These things regularly give false information in authoritative voices and they want to use it to evaluate drugs?  Labelling glorified chatbot/web crawler mash up as artificial intelligence has to be the greatest marketing victory on the planet.,jay_alfred_prufrock,2025-05-07T15:28:55,6

"**The Food and** Drug Administration (FDA) has been meeting with [OpenAI](https://www.wired.com/tag/openai/) to discuss the agency’s use of AI, according to sources with knowledge of the meetings. The meetings appear to be part of a broader effort at the FDA to use this technology to speed up the drug approval process.  “Why does it take over 10 years for a new drug to come to market?” wrote FDA commissioner [Marty Makary on X](https://x.com/drmakaryfda/status/1920151300429185233) on Wednesday. “Why are we not modernized with AI and other things? We’ve just completed our first AI-assisted scientific review for a product and that’s just the beginning.”  The remarks followed an annual meeting of the American Hospital Association earlier this week, where Makary spoke about AI’s potential to aid in the approval of new treatments for diabetes and certain types of [cancer.to](http://cancer.to) discuss the agency’s use of AI, according to sources with knowledge of the meetings. The meetings appear to be part of a broader effort at the FDA to use this technology to speed up the drug approval process.
