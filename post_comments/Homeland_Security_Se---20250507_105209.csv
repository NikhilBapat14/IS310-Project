"From Tina Sfondeles and George Wiebe:   Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday stood in front of the Springfield home of a woman who is suspected of being murdered by a man who lacked legal status ‚Äî calling Illinois‚Äô sanctuary status ‚Äúabsolutely disastrous for people who live here.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGovernors like JB Pritzker don‚Äôt care if gangbangers, if murderers, rapists and pedophiles roll free in his state,‚Äù Noem said in front of Emma Shafer‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúIf they are here illegally, he‚Äôs going to protect them.‚Äù  Law enforcement suspects Shafer, 24, was stabbed to death by her ex-boyfriend, Gabrel Calixto Pichardo, who was born in Mexico and brought to the U.S. by his mother as a child. He was granted DACA status at age 15, but his status expired and he was no longer eligible for DACA because he had been been previously convicted of a felony. He remains at-large.  Shafer‚Äôs family attended a counter-protest against Noem‚Äôs visit.

"If they‚Äôre not going to hold the various actual rapists in public office at the moment accountable, why should I listen to them when they accuse anyone and everyone darker than a Manila folder of being rapists?    Taking moral stances from these Nazi dipshits is like taking leftovers from Jeffrey Dahmer, except that Dahmer‚Äôs leftovers still have some humanity left in them.",teebalicious,2025-05-07T11:48:39,2
The way how she looks at people scares me. Not to mention if you can kill an untrainable dog despite...just giving it to a shelter or something else... then you can do anything.,happyfundtimes,2025-05-07T14:02:17,2
