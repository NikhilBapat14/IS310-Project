"Are there any shady assassin type people buying up his meme coin just to get close to him? ðŸ¤ž I donâ€™t condone violence, but why would he light the worldâ€™s dumpster fire and then invite anyone to pay in the hopes they can get some orange-face time?",thebeardofawesomenes,2025-04-24T08:19:07,1
Someone with a consistent and persistent proclivity for self-dealing cannot possibly have the interest of others in his heart. Why is this conflict of interest not obvious to EVERYONE?,MaxwellSmart07,2025-04-24T08:24:35,1
How is this not straight up Bribery? Is it because congress are feckless old people that don't understand the grift right in front of their eyes? Or are they just as corrupt and apathetic? I don't understand how you can spin this any other way?,dingusmingus2222,2025-04-24T08:30:08,1

"Not sure why he bothers with the halfhearted attempts to hide it. His cronies could deliver wheelbarrows full of gold to him, he would post pics on his stupid social media site, and his worshipers would cheer his genius.",Spottswoodeforgod,2025-04-24T07:24:39,3
"I agree, but, at least lawsuits may cause judges to halt whatever action they are doing until the case is over. That and the more we can bog them down with lawsuits the better",susibirb,2025-04-24T10:21:24,2
