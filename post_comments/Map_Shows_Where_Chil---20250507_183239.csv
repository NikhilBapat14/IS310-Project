You know people complain about living up here a lot but New England and the north east in general fucking rocks compared to the rest of the country overall.  I get less patriotic for America and more  proud of the north east corner of sanity every day it feels.,Malaix,2025-05-07T18:49:49,42

"According to the article:  >Child marriage remains legal in most states, many of which allow children as young as 15 or 16 years old to get married. A handful of states have no age requirements at all for marriage. About 300,000 children have gotten married since 2000, according to Unchained at Last, an organization that fights for laws banning child marriage.",Ace-Cuddler,2025-05-07T18:43:27,3

">Maine's ban on child marriage means the practice is now banned in the entirety of New England, ending what advocates view as a potential child marriage haven.  Let’s hope that the “north east corner of sanity” continues to spread to the rest of the USA.",Ace-Cuddler,2025-05-07T19:45:39,5

The Northeast should detach itself from the rest of the country. It should no longer have anything to do with the infamous Alabama and Missouri.,nicoppolis,2025-05-08T06:21:14,1

I'm not shocked. Cali has the most conservatives out of any other state. Its practically a country unto itself. The conservatives are just outnumbered by the liberals and leftists.,Malaix,2025-05-07T18:48:41,11
"It's horrible that CA. has no age requirement. Oklahoma I get, but ultra liberal CA... I guess it's freedom all the way there as if the Gold Rush is still on.  It's really so stupid and incredibly sexist.",fxkatt,2025-05-07T19:02:00,2

It's not. The most densely populated part of the country is all that light blue color. America's biggest mistake was expanding beyond the original 13 states.,mkt853,2025-05-07T20:53:33,3

"But, with an issue this important, one would hope that lawmakers would be quick to rectify this oversight.  And, not all people agree that it’s an immoral relic of the past. In fact, Republicans like Rep. Jess Edwards of New Hampshire and Missouri State Sen. Mike Moon openly support keeping child marriage legal. So, these marriages continue to happen.  According to the article:  >About 300,000 children have gotten married since 2000",Ace-Cuddler,2025-05-07T20:14:16,5
"The average life expectancy being 40 years old was because many infants and children did not survive into adulthood which heavily skews the statistic. Modern adult life expectancy is a little higher than it used to be, but it's a much less dramatic increase than that.",Hunter5024,2025-05-07T22:24:53,5
You are wrong. Average life expectancy was low because half of all people died within a year of birth. If you have half the people live to 80 and half die at 0 you get average life expectancy of 40. People regularly lived to old age in the past.,sasheenka,2025-05-08T01:12:08,1
"Denial springs eternal.  Hence why they can never quit that pablum about “Democrat cities and gun violence!”?

"You know what...we could do it! The infrastructure is there. Financially we'd be a economic powerhouse. We'd have all the brain power to innovate thanks to having the majority of ivy league schools and research centers.

> The conservatives are just outnumbered by the liberals and leftists.  This is the thing. It doesn't matter that there are many conservatives when there are a ton more liberals. The Democrats have a government trifecta and a supermajority and could easily get this ban done.,ClaroStar,2025-05-08T05:06:05,1
Presidentially. But Republicans hadn't controlled both chambers of the state legislature since 1959 and the governorship went back and forth.  Edit: Actually Republicans did control the legislature for two years after the 1968 elections. That was the last time.,Mundane_Rabbit7751,2025-05-07T19:02:49,5
