"They want them to voluntarily discharge themselves. They must not think them worthy of an honorable discharge.  For the people who don't know the distinction, when leaving the military, you get assigned a condition of that discharge:  Honorable Discharge: You get full vet benefits, and it's a stamp of approval on your time in service from the government. You receive full benefits and honors. Your time in was an asset to your resume. This means you didn't cause serious problems, you served you full contract, and you served good order and discipline. Most vets get this.   General Discharge: You get most benefits, but future employers can see this as getting fired from the military and raises questions. This occurs for physical readiness issues, family issues cause you needing to quit, or if you were a problem and didn't serve good order and discipline. Your time in may mean nothing under this code to your future employment.  Other Than Honorable (OTH) Discharge: You had conduct issues that lead to you getting fired before your contract is up. The conduct was probably equivalent to a civilian misdemeanor, and you might have barely dodged court marshal. At this level and lower, the federal government does not categorize you as a veteran. Your time in will probably hurt your chances at good employment as a civilian.  Bad Conduct Discharge: A punitive measure that can result from court marshal. You have been deemed unfit to serve. This can be a hard thing to explain to future employers.  Dishonorable Discharge: Much like bad conduct discharge, but the court marshal was addressing a felony-level crime under the UCMJ. The federal government has labelled you a dishonorable, and the only real difference between this and a civilian felony offense is that you aren't disenfranchised.  It's looking like they are pushing for voluntary discharge, and will likely fall into General or OTH. Many of these trans service members were incredibly dedicated and honorable.

I know working for the government isn’t super appealing these days, but just for argument sake, I will share a quick story.   A really good friend of mine  was outed by someone at his command and was discharged under “don’t ask don’t tell” policy just before it was taken down. Sometimes I wonder if he was the very last person discharged under that bullshit.   Anyway, he ultimately was given an other than honorable, and he was telling me that this really fucked him over. He should have been able to apply to a govt job and get veteran preference in hiring, but the OTH discharge prevented that.   I think the same may apply for working in state governments, but each state is different, and I don’t know for sure.   So service members thinking about this should consider the details. They matter!

"https://www.forbes.com/sites/lindseyedarvin/2024/04/25/transgender-athletes-could-be-at-a-physical-disadvantage-new-research-shows/  Significant Findings:      Transgender women performed worse than cisgender women in tests measuring lower-body strength.      Transgender women performed worse than cisgender women in tests measuring lung function.      Transgender women had a higher percentage of fat mass, lower fat-free mass, and weaker handgrip strength compared to cisgender men.      Transgender women’s bone density was found to be equivalent to that of cisgender women, which is linked to muscle strength.      There were no meaningful differences found between the two groups’ hemoglobin profiles. Hemoglobin (Hb) plays a crucial role in athletic performance by facilitating improved oxygen delivery to muscles. Elite endurance athletes may exhibit up to a 40% higher level of Hb compared to untrained individuals. Moreover, heightened levels of Hb typically correlate with enhanced aerobic performance.
