"There's the obvious tariff debacle, especially regarding Canada.  Then there's this: ""She said one thing that she heard Friday that really stuck out to her are the immigration issues farmers are having with workers being detained or simply not showing up for fear of being deported.""  I'm guessing these guys were responsible for taking away ""American jobs.""",Hodaka,2025-04-26T16:47:18,5

"I get the paper edition of Vanity Fair.  This article, originally a digital article from back in March, was in my mailbox this weekend:  [https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/how-elissa-slotkin-is-fighting-trump-tooth-and-nail?srsltid=AfmBOorFRpZTiLUT63NP8IpHGmLJys\_lcAeMkakiqkZHaNdovyzasceX](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/how-elissa-slotkin-is-fighting-trump-tooth-and-nail?srsltid=AfmBOorFRpZTiLUT63NP8IpHGmLJys_lcAeMkakiqkZHaNdovyzasceX)  This is the second article I have read about her in a week in which she states she is not ""woke.""  In neither article does she define it.  She talks about her mom coming out as gay precipitating her parents' divorce in the 1980's.  She talks about her mom caring for friends dying of AIDS back then and Slotkin's dislike for Reagan since.  So, what is ""woke"" to Slotkin?  I can't get a handle on her.  My best take is that she is trying to play both sides.  She seems to ""think"" she has to bc she barely won her seat in the Senate when Trump won Michigan.  A quick Google search shows that a Republican only won a Senate seat in the 1970's and one for one term in the 1990's.  Michigan elects Democrats for Senators.",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-04-27T13:10:21,0
Maybe they should start marketing these jobs as outdoor manufacturing jobs.  That's what Magat's were expecting from the tarrifs.,PKanuck,2025-04-26T17:39:04,5
I heard someone say slotkin wants to be republican but would be shamed by family and friends so is a democrat. I could see it.,ghost_pinata,2025-04-26T18:22:58,4
"So a politician who helps write and pass big historic bills that accomplish Drmocratic goals and help people, like the Infrastructure Bill and the biggest climate action bill ever,  the Inflation Reduction Act?  Much better than someone who does nothing to help people in their 35 year congressional career, like Sanders.   Also, the far left have nothing to actually attack her about, so it's just a vaguely negative, unjustified attack about what might happen in the future? Are they mad she got attention from giving a good response to the State of the Union, when they think only Sanders should get attention?",aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-04-27T21:56:27,-1
