"Putin has state-owned media.  Xi has state-owned media.  Orban has state-owned media.  Kim has state-run media.  Of course Donnie needs to have state-owned media.  His ego can't handle anything other than adulation and praise from his acolytes.  For profit, of course.",smiama36,2025-05-08T07:11:28,193

So many greedy willing scum bags ready to throw America under the bus at any opportunity.,Stinkstinkerton,2025-05-08T08:28:11,6
VOA will now be known as stated-own propaganda MAGA media. Absolutely disgusting.,crazydave33,2025-05-08T09:19:25,7
The Führer is going to have a state run network to spread propaganda and it’ll be the only network available. This is just the beginning of the propaganda network,CAM6913,2025-05-08T08:13:35,5

The Trump administration is destroying democracy and the voice of democracy in this country.    That's what he'll be remembered for. ,Professional-Law-207,2025-05-08T08:22:21,5
"I mean Trump calls his own social media platform “truth” - just like the main USSR newspaper, Pravda, back in the day. He’s nothing if not a Russian stooge.",Flippin_diabolical,2025-05-08T09:31:11,4

Except OAN isn't state owned by Americans or Trump. It's a Russian propaganda arm that is pretending to be an independent organization. Trump is literally linking Russian propaganda directly into the Voice of America as a way to please his own ego.,DisMFer,2025-05-08T08:23:21,110
"It’s like everything conservatives have been afraid of happening for decades is literally happening because of their support for MAGA. State media, surveillance, data harvesting, human trafficking, constitutional violations and soon to be a police state.",Apprehensive_Pin3536,2025-05-08T10:03:57,16
I don't think he views it like them in quite the same way.  His is more ego-driven than from an information warfare perspective.,KungFuSnafu,2025-05-08T07:50:50,5

Nothing short of a revolution will undo this damage in our lifetime. I truly think this administration will ensure fair elections are a thing of the past.,TheJaybo,2025-05-08T08:30:46,25
Let’s just say the competition is fierce.,specqq,2025-05-08T08:09:47,40
"Exactly!  Why would you make a point of bro broadcasting into someone's country outside of your own country just to tell them how much you dislike their people, trading with them, their products, or them aspiring to come to a democracy.    The headline should be ""Government to fund hate-speech megophone into other countries!""",The_Dutchess-D,2025-05-08T08:16:32,6
"To be fair, there's significant Russian propaganda on there too.",CockBrother,2025-05-08T07:58:50,17

1984 also had the ministry of truth… which was nothing but.  “The past was alterable. The past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia.”,Life_Commission3765,2025-05-08T09:33:34,2

"VOA has always been about propaganda, just not so cartoonishly blatant about disinformation as OAN will be.",HoightyToighty,2025-05-08T09:54:25,10
"VOA *is* state-funded media, even if OAN isn't. Using VOA to distribute OAN propaganda is the issue here.",RobAtSGH,2025-05-08T09:36:44,56
"They've been accusing others of doing this, without evidence, for at least a decade to prepare - To make it seem to their voters like MAGA is doing these horrible things defensively. It's the same as Putin: Accusing Ukraine of starting a war when Russia is the aggressor.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-08T10:51:41,9
When I say “state-run” I mean in service to Trump and what he wants to hear.,smiama36,2025-05-08T14:32:38,2
"It's explicitly a propaganda network, but oftentimes the propaganda we've wanted to spread is ""you should have freedom and hope"".",thrawtes,2025-05-08T08:51:00,21
VOA actually made an effort to be factual. That isn't compatible with this administration. Being accurate and objective is explicit in their journalistic standards.,Number6isNo1,2025-05-08T09:42:07,11
"You should spend some time learning about the history of VOA and absorbing some of its content over the years. It's one of the more diverse and multicultural news organizations in the world, employing and working with many foreign journalists and producers. VOA does everything from regular news to foreign documentaries. You have a misunderstanding of the organization.",superkeer,2025-05-08T15:18:06,2
"Because nothing OAN engages in qualifies news, nor is any of it journalism. It's straight-up propaganda and spun political commentary.",Predator_,2025-05-08T11:07:34,6
"VOA has always been pro-American propaganda.   Back when my grandfather was killing Nazis, they recognized the need for a white-hat variety of propaganda. Nazis used media, rallies and radio to rise to power, then to convince their people to do terrible things based on lies. To change hearts you must drive wedges.    Joseph Goebbels and Stephen Miller even look alike.",mckulty,2025-05-08T15:58:11,2
VoA hada mandate to remain impartial before this though. They did america puff pieces but never were suppose to push any parties messaging. So state owned? Yeah but not as a party organization.,toxic_badgers,2025-05-08T10:42:26,7
"Sure I get it but my point was not all government operated media is bad, the UK has the BBC as well.",new_mutants_82,2025-05-08T14:37:22,1
"They also aren't supposed to make content for American audiences, but have you ever heard so much about this fucking outlet than in the last few months?  In case you haven't noticed, normal rules don't apply too much anymore.",InsuranceToTheRescue,2025-05-08T10:49:57,4
I think you're missing the point: It had a mandate before this. The post makes it clear *that mandate is no longer being observed*. So it's transitioned from state-owned to state-mouthpiecing.,whogivesashirtdotca,2025-05-08T16:38:51,2
"this is why the term ""public service broadcaster"" tends to be used for organisations like the BBC (and most of its EBU peers), CBC, NHK, etc where the government doesn't have much day to day influence or editorial control.",bbbbbbbbbblah,2025-05-08T15:45:42,3
"The BBC has fallen far from its pedestal in past decades. I used to listen regularly but it's been put under the care of Tory overseers for years who've really yanked the Overton Window to the right. They seemed to have a mandate to dismiss anything Corbyn said while he was leading Labour, and more recently they were shouting down and cutting off any Palestinians who dared to speak against genocide. Meanwhile, they invited on Israeli government officials to spout lies uncontested. It was really jarring hearing how the two sides were treated so differently.",whogivesashirtdotca,2025-05-08T16:42:11,1
That was my point but Ok.,toxic_badgers,2025-05-08T16:51:46,0
