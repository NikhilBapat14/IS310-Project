"> Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is eager to secure the Trump administration’s approval for a multibillion-dollar sale of her company to Skydance, a company run by the son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison. She has expressed a desire to settle Mr. Trump’s case, which stems from what the president has called a deceptively edited interview in October with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on “60 Minutes.”  This is just beyond fucking stupid. Trump’s lawyers should be facing ethical consequences for such frivolous bullshit, but greed has a stranglehold on Redstone’s brain.",mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T13:43:24,35

We fell asleep at the wheel during COVID. Thats when Ru and Ch colluded to de stabilize the west and western democracy. This is a direct result as both Ru and Ch behave this way. Why aren't people peacefully protesting in droves in America? This is what baffles me.,Critical_Alfalfa_474,2025-04-22T20:04:43,4

It's a bribery hack.  Trump files a frivolous lawsuit against someone with business against the government.  They pay off the lawsuit.  The government grants their request.,Uhhh_what555476384,2025-04-22T14:06:01,18
