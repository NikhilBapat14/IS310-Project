Accountability is not a one way road.,AndForeverNow,2025-04-26T10:01:43,506
I love how the Democrats and their propaganda machine keep trying to make it sound like Trump had this judge arrested simply because she was critical of Trump. Personally I think all the noise about this Wisconsin judge is an attempt to overshadow the New Mexico Judge who was arrested for harboring an illegal alien gang member and destroying evidence.,johnnyg883,2025-04-26T10:30:42,113
"It is amazing how the left can insult us for years but screams discrimination or hate speech when we give them well deserved insults, or how they can scream racism when there is none while actively starting up an anti-white propaganda campaign, or how they can impeach their political opponent twice on made up charges and fabricated ‚Äúevidence, try to jail their opponent on massively twisted legal shenanigans that even shifted an unpursued federal crime (lack of enough evidence for prosecution) into 30+ State crimes AND use a kangaroo court to convict, or jail trespassers and vandals and hold them for years without due process..never convicting them of the crime they were original arrested for and subjecting them to another kangaroo court where due process was also ignored by refusing to see witnesses beneficial to the defense or refusing to admit or even suppressing exculpatory evidence‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and a hell of a lot more nastiness, lawfare and violence against the right‚Ä¶..yet when they start facing justice for actual criminal activity it‚Äôs somehow ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù. SMH the left thinks, acts and talks in every way like fascists. (Which they also project onto us). I‚Äôm not religious but the word that most aptly describes them is Evil.",nonnativespecies,2025-04-27T09:55:13,9

"I disagree. We do have people that are above the law, and that‚Äôs the demoncrats. Why? It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre morally superior. /s  Edit: yep. I‚Äôm right over the target.

A very good question,Edgezg,2025-04-26T10:00:22,128
"The only thing we can assume is there are names that would be a massive blow to both parties. Otherwise either side would‚Äôve released it. If either side had tried to release only a partial list, then the other would‚Äôve gone nuclear on them.",Sgthouse,2025-04-26T11:13:41,113

This is my theory too. I don‚Äôt think we will ever see the true list at this point.   Neither side‚Äôs top dogs wants it released. It‚Äôll remain locked up until this country is destroyed and it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore or until time itself ends.,ITrCool,2025-04-26T11:59:51,53
"I think another theory is possible:  In typical Trump ""negotiating"" fashion, he asks for (or threatens) the extreme, to bargain for something in the middle.  In this case, he had his team announce that they were going to release the list within 24 hours, and he negotiated something during that 24 hours which caused him to not release the list.   It may have been with another country.  Who knows.",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-26T15:23:58,-1
"I don‚Äôt care. Upvotes and downvotes mean nothing to me, as all they do is move the needle on an internet browny points gauge: a gauge that has no value in the real world. Karma is just the Reddit equivalent of China‚Äôs social credit score.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-04-27T06:15:24,3
"Actually quite likely If the Dems actually had anything legit on Trump regarding this they would have used it last year.  Given the current state of the Left, I doubt Mutually Assured Destruction is keeping them at bay- I don't think redditors would actually care if big Dems were found on the Epstein list given everything we already know about people like the Clintons.",icantgetthenameiwant,2025-04-30T01:25:22,2
