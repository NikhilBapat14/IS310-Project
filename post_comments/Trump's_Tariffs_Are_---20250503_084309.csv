Just like how you're suppose to live a modest, humble life where you sacrifice for the betterment of god and his will. Then when you die, you're rewarded with eternal bliss. The lack the critical thinking skills to see just much that sucks because 1) you have to be dead, which means that religion never had any dissatisfied customers asking for a refund and 2) no matter how much they suffer for Trump, he will never save them. Hell he doesn't even try and hid the fact that he sees his followers as disgusting.
