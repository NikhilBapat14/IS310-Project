Conservatives own this. Anyone who advocates for conservative economic policy should be forced to explain why they believe American businesses should lose money.,gradientz,2025-04-25T18:56:11,57
This is likely going to come to a head around May 10th as the full effect of the tariffs really start to hit the shores. Likely to be very sudden. ,Current_Animator7546,2025-04-25T18:52:08,26

It's too late to fix it. Not just because of what Trump is doing but because literally everybody else with power or influence is too scared to stop him.,Ok-Excuse1771,2025-04-25T20:08:03,2

"The point is that no one trusts the U.S. anymore. People already started to lose confidence in the U.N. foe being unable to stop Russian invasion to Ukraine, or the genocide in Gaza. Now, the U.S. is no longer ruled by law. The whole post-WW2 regime lost its credibility along with its leader, the U.S.",HannahArdent,2025-04-25T23:40:55,1

Sadly they seem to PROUDLY own this. Like it's some badge of honor to wreck the economy so we can get to a better place. 🤦🏼‍♂️,JeremyF1978,2025-04-25T19:28:58,22

"Businesses will not lose money, at least the ones that count. When, I should say if, the economy recovers they'll just add inflation to all the prices until things stop selling.

"Lmao I need to take a moment to dissect Trump’s makeup because it’s genuinely haunted me for years—and not just because he’s orange. I’m into makeup. On women, on gay men, on drag queens—on literally anyone who’s out here trying to do it well or at least improve over time. Trump? Trump picked a look in the '80s and said, “Yes, this is it. Let’s make it worse.”  Beyond being Cheeto-dusted, it’s also oily as hell and somehow manages to highlight every pore, crater, and whisper of human frailty on that man’s face. It’s like he’s actively trying to contour his own downfall. Even “older” women—i.e., anyone over 30—know that when it comes to makeup, less is more. Trump said, “Nah, more is war.”  I read somewhere that he uses a Swedish colour corrector as foundation. A colour corrector, which is supposed to go under foundation to neutralize undertones, not be the whole damn face. This man looked at a shade called “Pantone: Golden Flame” and said, “Yes. My natural skin tone.” Pair it with his gaudy-ass TRUMP GAZA! #1 statue and, honestly? The math is mathing.  Now picture this: Trump, not as president, just waddling into some hardcore MAGA dive bar in full orange greasepaint, with that sad-ass combover hanging on for dear life, a literal diaper bulking out his khakis like a busted Smashburger, and a suit that fits like it’s mad at him. Do you think these people would welcome him? Hell no. They’d mock him to his face. They’d ask him what high school theater production he’s late for.  The whole thing is just so dystopian. These people are so brainwashed they can’t see the clown paint through the fascism. Oh and JDs eyeliner or whatever the fuck is going on with Pete’s drunken side burn shaving. I’m embarrassed when I shave my legs and forget my big toe, this man out here missing a whole appendage. Embarrassments to “real men,” all of them.",Super-Background-770,2025-04-25T20:02:01,7

"it will not only take years to gain trust again, it will require changes in the US's political system. the fact that every 4 years a new administration can expunge US programs, international memberships in crucial organizations, and world-policies without any repercussions is ridiculous.   such a power-grab cannot ever be allowed to happen again, and apparently the measures in place for this case don't cut it. so a change has to happen and it might be a good idea to get rid of the electoral college, not least to give third/fourth/fifth parties a chance to be heard. if people only have the option to vote for the lesser evil, there will never be positiv politics and US representatives won't actually represent anybody.  as bad as it currently is, this might be a chance to turn things around to become a better democracy. but that's really up to the american people at this point.",JenkinsHowell,2025-04-26T06:01:37,4
"We are already well into fascism. I do g know if I’ll be alive the next time we have fair elections, and I’m only 52. I think the US is in for a decades long authoritarian rule and that the only thing that will reverse it is a second revolution. If it happens at all. Trump already made it clear that there would be “no need” for elections. Because they intend to cheat just as they’ve been accusing us. Trump won’t have a second term because he will be obviously demented by then, but it will be one of his children, probably Don Jr.",Perle1234,2025-04-26T05:23:56,3

"But Trump is not going to stop, in fact he is just getting started. Trump believes that he is the smartest person in the room and only his opinion matters. He is going to fuck up the entire economy and then lie and say it's the best it's ever been.  Just the other day he said the price of eggs has gone down, while his own Easter egg costs were 6 bucks a dozen, making his lie easily checked and obvious.  Truckers and shippers are already saying there cargo loads are down due to no shipments from China, and again Trump lies and says there is nothing wrong. We will soon have empty shelves.  Things are going to get worse.",Trump_sucks_d,2025-04-25T21:43:06,1

"Republican voters are under the impression that the economy and institutions favor the left.   By their actions, they seem to believe that breaking the government is a good thing because it was never supposed to have the influence it does.   The problem is that change scares them and contort themselves and their positions to somehow resist reality itself.   The *only* thing that seems to move the needle is when they (some) are directly affected. The rest just quiet down and mutter their nuttery in smaller circles.   That's what's going to serve as the best we can ask for because everything points to worse outcomes at this pace.   The scary part is that those cheering the economy crashing also look forward to what they see as inevitable violence.",citizenjones,2025-04-26T23:24:54,3

"Conservatism, as a discernable political movement, basically arose in the 18th century as an effort to protect the monarchy against the rise of liberal democracy.   The objectives of the movement have since been obfuscated by literally millions of pages of pseudo-philosophy. But the foundation has always been the same: peasants must adhere to our rules, but those rules don't apply to the king and his friends.",gradientz,2025-04-26T12:43:40,2
