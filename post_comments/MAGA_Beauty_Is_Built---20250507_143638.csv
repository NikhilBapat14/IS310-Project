This is Christianity today. If you claim to be Christian. I assume you run with these idiots. Change my mind by getting rid of the slime of the earth that's representing you.,FunkyTown313,2025-05-07T14:49:56,14

Republicans own the information space. Democrats don't care to own the information space. They go hold up signs instead,Threeseriesforthewin,2025-05-07T16:12:41,2

"I’m glad it’s somewhat being talked about, these motherfuckers are ugly as fuck. And we know they are all going for that look.   I think Republican makeup is the perfect description for it.   Gotta see ugly ass Kristi Noem on some commercial every time I watch my local news station, I’m tired lol.",Ok_Use7,2025-05-07T16:49:12,1
"It's based on white supremacy. Of course it will in this country.  This is a religion where [""empathy is called a sin.""](https://www.salon.com/2025/04/11/magas-on-empathy-exposes-misogynist-fears/)  This is a culture that glorifies anything white.",sabedo,2025-05-07T17:00:22,1
"This is really unhelpful. There are ~224,000,000 christians in the US. ~77,330,000 people voted for Trump. There are ~212,000,000 white people in the US. 56% of Trump voters were christian, and 56% of Trump voters were white.    So there is a closer correlation between being white and voting for Trump, than being christian and voting for Trump. But I don't see you saying ""if you're white, I assume you run with these idiots"", even though that is statistically a safer assumption (though still ill-supported; both groups had less than 1/3 of their membership vote for Trump).",trotptkabasnbi,2025-05-07T16:41:45,4
