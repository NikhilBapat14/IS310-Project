Begging these people to spend time with their great grandchildren instead of doing this shit,Golod1289,2025-04-30T15:27:40,45
For the love of all that is holy can we please get someone that does not qualify for an AARP membership?   Jasmine Crockett is already the Vice Chair. It‚Äôs an easy transition. The geriatrics had their turn.,Spicy_Pancake1,2025-04-30T15:28:33,34
Born in 1937. No! She does not want to be ranking member because she loves this country. She wants to be ranking member for the power it gives her. Getting real tired of democrats not giving a shit about how democrat voters feel about them letting the country get run into the ground. You know how people keep going to huge protests against Trump? Maybe it's about time democrats start protesting these dinosaurs as well.,mces97,2025-04-30T15:28:00,34

"Do I really want an almost 90 year old making decisions for all of us? Not really. Am I _really_ suspicious of the writer putting age at the forefront and throughout and article like this? Yes I am.  Where's that journalist from the AMA yesterday that said journalists can't stop sane-washing Trump because they're not supposed to influence the reader and stick to the facts?  I'd like to see them defend this article.  While I settle in for both sides, Democrats are bad, and old people suck comments, I'm just going to point out that people are _absolutely_ being played with this bullshit.
