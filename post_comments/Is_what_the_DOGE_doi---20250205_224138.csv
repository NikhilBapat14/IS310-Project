"Definitely not. They were not elected nor did the Congress approve them. This makes them only private citizens, who do not have the authority to do this.  There are two Democratic candidates running in a special election in Florida now, Gay Valimont and Josh Weil, who are opposed to this illegal takeover.

"So I have never been into politics as a whole. I will admit that. But, before they started this, when it was an just idea or plan, don‚Äôt they have like a team of lawyers or something who say ‚Äúlets rethink this and revise the plan because this, this, and this are going to be issues and they will immediately shut you down‚Äù?  Also, is musk actually making the calls on what gets cut? I was under the impression that he was just doing the investigating and then giving that information to someone to have it reviewed and then they decided on.",mlbmo22,2025-02-13T11:53:49,1

Everyone is being asked to NOT purchase ANYTHING from ANY PLACE on Feb. 28th. NOTHING. It's a good way to show how many people in this country are against what's going on.,Healthy_Juice630,2025-02-14T17:28:03,2

"No, they don't seem to have consulted anybody about any of this illegal activity. And yes, he and his ""team"" are just cutting programs without any idea what they are, based on nothing but, seemingly, cost. No one is reviewing it before he just stops paying people, and thanks to his shutdown at AID, adults and children all over the planet are dying.  The richest man on earth is deliberately and without remorse starving the poorest people on the planet. It isn't just illegal--it's evil.   Auditing programs would be a normal thing, but this isn't that. Audits do not require the shutdown of a department--or even a single office. Auditing isn't sending six random cyber-freaks into the computer at Treasury to stop writing checks. Audits take time and care, and work continues as usual while they happen. This is just vandalism. That's why judges keep telling them to stop it.",DidjaSeeItKid,2025-02-13T16:10:23,4
The have a team of lawyers looking for any loophole.  Like using the aliens act of 1789...   1789! wtf!?,JustADamnedGuy,2025-03-20T18:13:27,1
"Are you familiar with the term ‚Äúflood the Zone‚Äù?  There is no reason for one of the 200 Eos to get that focus until laws are broken.   The focus started when they kicked the Head of Treasury to the curb, locked actual workers who monitor the system out and took over.    EO are not laws. DOGE is not approved. Musk is not approved by Congress and he has the power he should be. An EO cannot just reassign a department name.   The Hackers now have very official titles, also bogus.   Trump cannot move USAID under the State Department without Congress.  Musk cannot legally be a special hire because of his conflicts of interest.",NeighborhoodNice9643,2025-02-15T23:51:43,2

"Also, Neither Musk nor any of his hench-bros know anything about accounting, government, appropriations, or finance. Musk is actually one of the dumbest people on Earth. And since he bought Twitter, its value is TWENTY PERCENT of what it was when he bought it. America can't afford Musk OR Trump. And just say goodbye to eggs, because none of the idiots running the government even know or care what bird flu even IS.",DidjaSeeItKid,2025-02-13T19:24:35,2
"While I do fully understand that theres a lot of other factors in it and things relying on the programs. If there is actual fraud, or weird stuff going on, what‚Äôs to say that the employees aren‚Äôt going to go into work and start getting rid of any evidence?   I feel like it‚Äôs one thing to look at over all numbers coming in and out and being like okay this isn‚Äôt making sense where is all this going vs what is this money actually being used on, is it actually being used on what they are saying. If no ones ever asked questions and tried to poke around looking, your going to have your guard down.  So in a way I can see having a shut down and looking.  But to just cut stuff you don‚Äôt actually know is crazy. I thought it was more of a ‚Äúthis is what we are seeing care to explain‚Äù. Like my husband when he looks at my credit card statement haha. He doesn‚Äôt just cancel my card more ‚ÄúWhy are you spending 300 at X place‚Äù then I say that was for our kids medical stuff. Okay there we go. Now I‚Äôm sure if I was racking up crazy charges on nonsense buying giant stuffed animals because I just want to make a room full of them, I‚Äôd get my funding shut down.",mlbmo22,2025-02-13T17:06:52,1

Gay for Congress is a pretty metal slogan,InsomniacHomebody,2025-02-21T21:51:28,4
"The funding for the agencies is approved and controlled by Congress. Congress has oversight. There are professional auditors assigned to agencies to monitor for fraud. They had their staff shut down spending that was not approved by Congress. The position is called Inspector Generals and is non-partisan. They were the first people to be fired.   When they went into the computer systems they locked out the employees who would be able to monitor what they were doing. Then they made up BS that Biden had stashed of cash and that they had evidence of fraud.   There has been no evidence. At best they identified issues already identified by the Inspector Generals they fired. There is zero evidence of an audit. It looks like they embedded Musk‚Äôs personal AI into the systems and did some word searches to ‚Äúidentify‚Äù ‚Äúfraud‚Äù. If you hear a title that sounds sketchy, ask what it actually did.   There was not 50 million in condoms to Gaza. Totally bogus.   There were no 150 year olds getting SS.",NeighborhoodNice9643,2025-02-15T23:49:50,1
