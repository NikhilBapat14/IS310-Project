"A lot of people think Project 2025 is just Trump world scrambling after losing 2020, but the truth is way bigger. This plan has been decades in the making.  The Heritage Foundation, a hard-right think tank founded in 1973, has been working on this since before Reagan. In 1981, they dropped the first ""Mandate for Leadership,"" basically a manual for how to gut and remake the federal government. Reagan used it. Every Republican president since has pulled from it. Project 2025 is just the newest rebrand of the same agenda.  It is technically ""nonpartisan,"" but it is packed with former Trump officials and MAGA loyalists. The goal? Make sure the next conservative president can fire huge chunks of the federal workforce, eliminate whole agencies, and stack the government with loyalists on day one. It is not just about Trump — it is about locking in minority rule for decades.  Bottom line: Project 2025 isn’t new. It is the result of a 50-year campaign to permanently shift power to the far right. If people don’t take it seriously, they are sleepwalking into an authoritarian future.  TL;DR: Project 2025 isn’t just a Trump thing. It’s the result of a 50-year conservative plan by the Heritage Foundation to take over and reshape the federal government permanently.",8bitmorals,2025-04-26T13:47:21,152

Constitutional amendments are a no-go.

We need the Dem version of Pam Bondi. We need a Dem version of Russ Vought to start putting the broken pieces of government back together.

AOC is a grass roots activist who likely would not accept corporate donations.  DNC cannot agree to that since corporations and billionaires also fund their campaigns heavily.,kindredfan,2025-04-26T16:30:43,5
"Depends on the whims of SCOTUS and how corrupt the individual president is, I guess.  SCOTUS could easily bend the justification for presidential immunity in a million different directions. For example, they could define (or at least, rule out specific actions) what an official act is.  And even if they don't, most presidents wont be willing to abuse their power just because they technically can (but it should still be fixed in the constitution since they could). Trump just doesn't give a fuck.",-CJF-,2025-04-26T16:30:58,3
"So you think if you are alleged of a crime, we should ship you off to Madagascar?  You think you are gonna get representation there? What about your family who you want to see? The solution is for you to learn civics and understand our constitution.   Immigration has really easy solutions. Simply make it so all employers have to check status of their employees and they are fined a huge sum if they are caught having undocumented labor. Additionally, more money for immigration lawyers. Why do we get like 99% the way to an immigration policy and then republicans walk away because the politics scare them. If your only solution to immigration is to tear up the constitution, then I really don’t know what to tell you. It’s like naive middle school behavior. Like open a book and think about how to solve problems instead of just throwing up your hands and wrecking the country.",JPenniman,2025-04-26T20:45:12,10
It was the voters who 'rigged' it against Bernie when the majority of them voted for someone else.,ShamelessLeft,2025-04-26T16:53:49,1
"A major difference is AOC has always been in the Democratic Party. Most of the complaints about rigging against Bernie don't acknowledge that Bernie's runs at the Presidency were as an Independent. He does not support party infrastructure, so why should he expect the party insiders to support him over candidates that did? I do not expect AOC to have the same issue should she run in 2028.",kstar79,2025-04-26T19:15:29,1

"I am an American and am not worried about getting shipped off.  Blame the employers for hiring people who shouldn't be here in the first place. More Americans money for lawyers. Blame Republicans for Immigration policy failure. Shouldn't it be Congress in general.  We have laws in place and quotas for the number of people who can come in. We check for correct documents of people coming through a port of entry. We have migrant visa programs, same as the rest of the world.  Never once did you say secure the border, force people to come through a legal port of entry. The last 4 years have been a free for all. The truth is, we have no idea who is here. That should scare you.  We should not have people living in America if we don't know who they are. The wreck of this country began 4 years ago.  I have no problem with immigration. People should be fully vetted before coming here for the safety of our citizens.",Appelcl,2025-04-26T21:40:10,-2

"You have no rights as an American if you undermine the constitution which you are. I mean if you want to “secure the border”, go ahead. I’m fine with the government spending money on that but I don’t think it reduces the incentives for migrants to come illegally. Also, no due process means there is no vetting if somebody is a citizen or not before removal—hence you aren’t protected and you can be shipped off to El Salvador. I’m pointing out areas where there was a breakdown in reforms because those reforms are needed. Literally, everyone is essentially ready to sit down and pass reforms through congress but the current admin hasn’t done anything regarding immigration in the Congress even though he could likely pass whatever he wants.  I’m not sure if you’d believe me if I told you this is largely red meat for the base. I’ll give you the policies you want as long as they are constitutional, but funnily enough the politicians you believe in won’t pass them because they benefit from their exploitation. The best thing for republicans is to make sure this problem never ends and they always can be seen as the ones trying to solve it, but the “evil democrats are preventing them to buy votes”. It’s just sad, because there is so much stuff that is more important and you are falling for pure grift.   In my view, the country ends when you end the constitution and we will be essentially 50 countries until we are reconstituted since the authority the created the government is no longer valid/legitimate. I don’t know why you are so insistent that the only way to end illegal immigration is to end the constitution and therefore the republic.",JPenniman,2025-04-26T22:22:45,10

"No one thinks he should have been handed the nomination. Seems like you may not have been paying attention during that time but a lot of very shady things happened and the DNC absolutely coordinated efforts for him to lose:  * Bernie was in first place going into Super Tuesday.  * The left wing media started a 24/7 smear campaign about how he couldn't win. * Just before ST all the candidates besides Warren and Biden dropped out, including Pete who was running in 2nd place.  * Warren stayed to split the progressive vote and everyone else endorsed Biden even though he wasn't even close to ranking at that point.  * Left wing media harps 24/7 on how only Biden can win and smears Bernie further by saying he's sexist without providing receipts.  * Day of ST many polling places that leaned towards Bernie (some in lower income areas where transportation is difficult) are inexplicably closed with no notice. This was announced only on Twitter just hours beforehand. People were showing up to vote and seeing notices of relocated areas far away from them.   Yeah, no foul play there...",squirrelux,2025-04-27T00:02:57,4
