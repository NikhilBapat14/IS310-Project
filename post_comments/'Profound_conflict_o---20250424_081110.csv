He doesn’t have the power to dismantle laws. Is anybody in that government gonna grow a fucking spine?,SLIPPTSHOW,2025-04-24T08:18:24,165
and so who is still convinced Trump did not commit fraud 34 times?  Seriously the guy is leaving you admissions by action everywhere.,TintedApostle,2025-04-24T08:17:18,45
">“Profound conflict of interest': Trump dismantles laws put in place to prevent fraud”  Really, it's just incredibly disturbing how much damage he's doing, I mean, the question of *what* specific laws are being dismantled, and what the potential repercussions are for everyday people, it's to be honest terrifying, and to be honest, should be making headlines everywhere... it's so important to understand the full scope of this, because if those safeguards vanish, where do we go? I guess, well, it feels like a slippery slope towards a completely unchecked system... and nobody wants that.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-24T08:21:17,29

"Well, they voted for an unrepentant convicted felon who skated from every prison sentence he deserved... this is what you expect.  He and his goons are robbing the government blind and using a bunch of noisy bullshit to hide it.",hackingdreams,2025-04-24T12:45:33,6

He did not suddenly gain the ability to modify laws idiots. Lawless actions have no backing behind them. Do not follow illegal orders.,Ging287,2025-04-24T10:59:30,3
"Jesus fucking Christ. “Profound conflict of interest” is the entire fucking gameplan. The “I’ve lost track of all the corruption” moment was almost a decade ago at this point. It never stops. It never will stop. Do something, or just shut the fuck up.",Bot_Fly_Bot,2025-04-24T14:34:04,3
Odd that dismantling fraud laws is a conflict of interest. It’s almost as if he was and is constantly committing fraud.,mytthew1,2025-04-24T15:46:31,3

Can't think why he would do that.,inthekeyofc,2025-04-24T15:42:27,1
"Is it a law change or an *executive order?*  Because the latter does not change the laws. We must uphold the law, and demand our checks and balances be restored.",rolfraikou,2025-04-24T22:10:16,1
Man this place has gone down the drain.   Over half the posts are paywalled and a non insignificant portion of the posts video clips. Straight garbage.,Gefilte_F1sh,2025-04-24T09:53:59,1
