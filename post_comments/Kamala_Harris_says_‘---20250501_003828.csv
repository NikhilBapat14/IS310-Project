"Dean Philips would like a word....  The best time to replace Biden was 2020 when he was talking about record players in the primary and lying about being arrested and reciting health insurance talking points, accosting voters by calling them ""fat"", and shaking reporters by their lapels while screaming ""Why why why!!""     He was already sundowning then but the establishment didn't care. The alternative was nominate Sanders and that was worse to them than handing Republicans back the presidency after bidens health was ultimately revealed in office.      But yeah at that late in the game it's hard to believe Kamala would think she could actually win. Her own advisors have admitted they were never ahead in the internal polls. And certainly folks like AOC who demanded we anoint Kamala share much in that blame. Kamala is just the same as running Biden but with more people motivated to turn out to vote against you.   It's odd but those loyal to biden in 2020 did the most damage. And those looking to replace Biden with Kamala in 2024 did almost as much damage. All Joe had to do was have a somewhat decent 2nd debate. The bar was so low. There was a way to win although it would have been so close I'm not sure why you'd really want it",ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-01T03:17:35,-5
\>Biden was a good president     And yet over 70% of voters in exit polling said they wanted a change candidate. Isn't part of being a good president the ability to leave voters relatively satisfied with your presidency?      Americans hated inflation and blamed Biden for it.  Your argument appears to be actually they liked inflation so Kamala running makes sense.      What data do you have that suggests Americans like inflation and were actually really stoked about bidens presidency?

"\>> No one, even to this day, after two defeats by trump, even mentions any responsibility of the top of the democratic party for the lost elections.  I think a lot more people than you think are saying this, which is evidenced by how the democratic party have been polling worse than Trump so far. I'll say it again that establishment democrats are shit and need to be primaried. But to compare them and say they are just as bad or imply that voting for Trump or refusing to vote when the choice is between an establishment democrat and Trump is fine and ""not your fault"" is almost as stupid as Trump saying the current state of the economy is not his fault.  Your action / inaction will always have consequences. Ideally, I want to vote for someone who will do everything they can to reverse the damage that Trump has done. Ideally, we can primary all of the establishment democrats out of their seats, especially the ones who didn't push back on the early DOGE bill that required democratic votes. But, if it comes down to Trump or a Trump sycophant or some establishment democrat... our democracy and future depend on the majority not opting out and making the obvious choice.",No-Selection-1895,2025-05-01T12:37:40,1
