"I'll believe it when I see it. If all they're doing is complaining to Chuck Schumer at the gym, this doesn't mean shit. Call me when they start making public statements or policy decisions to reflect their ""concerns"". I won't hold my breath",ninthandpine,2025-04-30T13:13:16,89
Their concern is how is polls are affecting them. Not at all on how his policies are affecting the country.,BehaviorControlTech,2025-04-30T13:19:52,25
They shouldn’t be. People have no memory. Or they don’t care.,TDeath21,2025-04-30T13:21:46,13
"It is depressing that we have to suffer for people to realize how bad Donald Trump is for America.  We have to endure 4 years of suffering.  If people had listened to the warnings of economists and experts about Donald Trump's tariffs and authoritarian government before election, we wouldn't be in this chaos.",reddittorbrigade,2025-04-30T13:13:19,11

"Sagging neck flab, sagging cottage cheese butt, and sagging poll numbers too. Is there anything about this guy that doesn’t sag???  He’s Saggy Hitler, but his cult doesn’t care. They just scream “Sag Heil!”",AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-04-30T13:38:13,4

"One Republican senator and three Republican strategists quoted...I'm not a journalist, The Hill, but maybe go with three Senators as well as three Republican strategists, and and for that full political triptych, get three Republican house Reps to go on record, too.   Then your headline of, ""Trump's sagging poll numbers become a concern for the GOP"" would be closer to a truer statement.",dispelhope,2025-04-30T14:14:21,3

"Only 64% of the country realizes that tariffs hurt consumers?   This is basic, basic, stuff.   It’s a consumption tax on consumer goods. That, by definition, hurts consumers.   36% of adults don’t know this?!?!? WTF?!",-Gramsci-,2025-04-30T15:53:13,2

"Idk, it’s hard to see Trump recovering very much trust after this. Something similar (though far less severe) happened to Biden after his first year in office and he just never came back from it.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-05-01T08:33:06,1

"4 years? What has already happened cannot be undone in 4 years and this is just the beginning. These changes, unfortunately, will likely have prolonged impacts that will span decades. In 4 years there’s no getting back to how things were, we need to come to grips with that. After a decade under extremely good leadership? Maybe we will become stable again. But the US will never again have the strength and influence it once had. It’s over unless something happens immediately.",rantrx,2025-04-30T14:21:38,4
"I would love to think that the lesson will be learned. There are local elections in England tomorrow and I think our far right populists party led by our Trump wannabe is going to do rather well.

">Does Trump even care about his poll numbers?  Yes.  He has a desperate need for validation.  He literally wants everyone to love him, and it still won't be enough to satisfy him.",6a6566663437,2025-04-30T20:59:32,1

"All that stuff was when he was in opposition and had years for people to forget. More importantly, it was abstract, rule of law stuff. Tariffs are and will affect people directly and brutally. And people get tired of the chaos. That’s the stuff that got him voted out in 2020.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-05-01T11:51:47,1
