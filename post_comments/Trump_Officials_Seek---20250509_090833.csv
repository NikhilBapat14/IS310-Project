"Well, if you needed proof this isn't about immigration, here it is. This is 100% race related.   ""The Afrikaners, however, had to wait no more than three months.  The arrival of the white South Africans comes after Mr. Trump signed an executive order suspending refugee admissions when he came into office. Then, in February, Mr. Trump created an exception for the resettlement of Afrikaners, while also cutting all U.S. financial assistance to South Africa.""",Lebarican22,2025-05-09T09:10:10,215

"The only thing I can think of, and I'll admit it's a bit of a stretch, is the fact that almost all the white refugees are farmers. Fsrming is obviously really important. Right now, many illegal immigrants work on farms, but they're only providing labor, not expertise. Trumo has also said he doesn't want to deport illegal immigrant farmers.  Hopefully, Trump is planning on beginning a process to convert many farms from corn, which we produce WAY too much of, to other types of vegetables. Trump has already frozen 2 billion ish in farm subsidies. A lot of that was going to corn if you believe John Oliver  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MI78WOW_u-Q&pp=ygUWTGFzdCB3ZWVrIHRvbmlnaHQgY29ybg%3D%3D  So, in the best, most favorable light to Trump, this could be part of a plan to get more farming knowledge into our economy.

We're not interested in wielding majority status (if we ever had it) as a weapon against anyone else. We, I, want to mind my business and be left alone.   The problem is kinda simple.   These people know the minority groups suffer for the choices made by the majority group... they can't imagine a scenario where that's not true. On the one hand, it's a tacit acknowledgement of the bullshit they know they're going. But they are also thinking of what they would do, if they were in our shoes. And they're too self-centered to even see that.
