"Let's start back at the Civil War. After Reconstruction ended, the Republicans enjoyed a similar span of dominance. Part of this was due to the fact that the South was effectively excluded from voting for a long period of time and part of it was due to how Civil War pensions gave Republicans a strong base of support.  However, the Republican Party started splintering between various wings in the early days of the 20th century, giving Democrats an opening. Coupled with the 'Solid South' that delivered reliable Democratic votes, this improved their chances.  At the same time, the Democrats had their own problem. They were essentially two different parties: the Southern Democrats and the Northern Democrats. The problem was that the Southern Democrats were an obstacle to electoral success in the North. However, once the Great Depression hit, the lack of effective response from Republicans coupled with Democratic promises of generous federal social programs made them more competitive in the North - especially amongst black voters who were otherwise unwilling to vote for the party of slavery/Jim Crow.  This 'FDR coalition' would last for the next few decades. However, while Jim Crow may have been politically unpalatable outside of the South, it did prove to be a substantial barrier to the South joining the rest of the nation economically. Once Jim Crow fell (and, arguably, air conditioning technology became more widespread), the South stopped being 'solid' for the Democrats and the parties started forming into more balanced insiders vs. outsiders dynamic.",ViskerRatio,2023-01-08T02:05:02,1
