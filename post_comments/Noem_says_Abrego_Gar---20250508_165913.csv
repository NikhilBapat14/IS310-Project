What companies, what officials or billionaires, what countries benefit from those decisions? Are we financially better off today than we were in 2024? Have gas, food, or goods lowered in price? Are we safer today than we were in 2024? We abandoned ALL of allies, are we stronger than we were in 2024? We are heading into recession, isolationism, and pre-civil-rights era policies.

"I think that was a massive mistake. But there's a couple things to that.. he does not have immunity for things done outside of his official capacity, so I think there is a strong argument that he can and likely will be prosecuted for numerous crimes committed after the 2020 election - but we'll see. The other thing, is that his immunity does not shield him from impeachment .. so IMO it is still Congress that has betrayed the country more so than the supreme court. Don't get me wrong, SCOTUS is acting in many cases very sketchy but the 9-0 ruling was pretty damn clear and was against Trump. But without Congress acting on his continual defiance of the order, the judicial branch has no teeth.

Despite this, they still won the 2025 congressional races for the Florida 1st and 6th districts, albeit with a strong shift to the Ds.   Declining to enforce a Bush era law, enacted to protect war crimes who willing engaged in torture and indefinite detention of individuals does not seem nearly as bad.  In my opinion, we are in this mess because the Ds and Rs play a game of constitutional chicken, where the Rs know that they Ds will ALWAYS veer off and crash into a pole at the last second (see Chuck “fight club” Schumer”) because Ds value norms.
