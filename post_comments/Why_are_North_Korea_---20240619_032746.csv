"North Korea is heavily sanctioned by the UN, which has essentially banned almost every type of military trade North Korea can do.  Russia has vetoed any way to continue monitoring these sanctions and is being accused of knowingly violating those sanctions.   >But neither are signatory to the other's sanctions, right?   Both Russia and DPRK are part of the UN, and Russia agreed and even supported the sanctions.",Naliamegod,2024-06-19T09:28:06,1
