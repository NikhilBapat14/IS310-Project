"The one advantage Vance had over the previous Pope was ""proficiency at providing the media with soundbites in English"" and now he doesn't even have that.

"The new Pope plays Wordle, the Scrabble-like mobile game Words With Friends, and watched the movie *Conclave* shortly before entering the real-life meeting that would elevate him to the Catholic Church’s highest office.  We know all of this thanks to an [interview](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/sports/mlb/chicago-cubs/got-it-wrong-brother-sets-record-straight-on-whether-new-pope-is-a-cubs-or-sox-fan/3741532/) with Pope Leo XIV’s brother in Chicago, Illinois, after he became the world’s first American pontiff. But we also know one more thing about the new Pope: he has been an opinionated user of social media.   In previous ages, interpreting the political messaging of the pope was an art in itself, left to Vatican watchers with decades of experience in deciphering the subtle meanings of particular forms of words, the taking of a particular papal name, or the symbology of using or rejecting particular vestments.  With Pope Leo XIV, who before his elevation was Cardinal Robert Prevost, there is little need to resort to such measures. Through what he has shared on X, the Elon Musk-owned social network formerly known as Twitter, we have a direct idea of his views on US politics, and the [policies of Donald Trump’s administration](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/trumps-critics-could-very-soon-look-like-chumps-3673093?ico=in-line_link).  As a cardinal, Prevost shared articles critical of Trump’s policy of family separation and detaining children at the border during his first term. More recently, he shared an article rebuking the President over his meeting with El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele, who is administrating the overseas prisons to which Trump was unlawfully deporting migrants.  The posts are perhaps most embarrassing of all to [Vice President JD Vance](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/jd-vance-disposable-mike-pence-3648160?ico=in-line_link), who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and who has publicly made much of his faith. Vance’s visit to the Vatican [was widely interpreted as a snub from Pope Francis](https://inews.co.uk/news/after-meeting-jd-vance-pope-delivered-pointed-message-world-3651427?ico=in-line_link), who initially passed off the substantive meeting to his deputy, before very briefly meeting Vance on Easter Sunday, just hours before his death.",theipaper,2025-05-09T08:51:52,104

"Vance would only be in a difficult position if he were a man of integrity. Such a person is the exact opposite of JD Vance. He has no principles other than his own ambition.  Vance once called Trump ""cultural heroin"" and texted a former classmate ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a--hole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler. How's that for discouraging?""  Vance reversed course on that once he decided to run for Senate and latet claimed the media misled him about Trump.This from someone who allegedly graduated from Yale Law School.  Vance had no problem with Trump lying that Vance's own constituents were eating cats and dogs and later admitted it was to get a ""story"" across in the media.  The idea that Vance cares that his theological opinions are contradicted by multiple Popes is ludicrous. Vance subscribes only to the Gospel of MAGA. His religious self-identification exists only as a means to attack his political opponents.",Constantinople2020,2025-05-09T12:12:23,3

People who were born Catholic have a much healthier relationship to the church. These people who convert as adults are always weird extremists ,JaqueStrap69,2025-05-09T13:03:37,33
"Vance has publicly offered a theological, Catholic, justification for Trumpism and its “America First” policies – citing a principle of “ordo amoris”, or “order of love”, essentially claiming Christianity teaches us to put our families first, then others around us, in concentric circles eventually ending with strangers.  Pope Francis publicly rejected that understanding of Catholicism, and in his previous social media posts, Pope Leo XIV did the same. Catholic doctrine holds that the pope is infallible when it comes to matters of theology (though not on broader political issues). JD Vance, a Catholic convert, has now been publicly contradicted by not one, but two, popes. To most Catholics, this would be an absolutely unendurable humiliation.  Magaworld, though, is somewhat divided on how to handle the first American Pope. Donald Trump clearly wants to claim Leo XIV’s elevation as a win, and has hailed it as such – and it is a bold man in Trump world who snatches a victory away from him.  But though Maga is more often associated with evangelical Christianity, it is surprisingly Catholic: five of the six conservative Supreme Court justices are Catholic, as is Steve Bannon, though the thrice-divorced architect of Trump’s first victory referred to Francis as a “false pope”. Maga Catholicism is increasingly divorced from the economically Left-wing global Catholic Church – and its influencers are already trying to dismiss Leo XIV as a “woke pope” (per influencer Laura Loomer, who [claims](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/national-security-agency-chief-deputy-director-dismissed-rcna199647) she convinced Trump to sack several senior intelligence chiefs) or even as a plot against Trump or Magaworld.",theipaper,2025-05-09T08:52:00,69

"Pope Leo may have been *born* in the U.S., but calling him the ""first American pope"" when he’s lived as a Peruvian citizen, serving the Church in Latin America for most of his life is just wrong of media to up-play.

"Converts are always an odd bunch. Converts will never have the culture ingrained into them, the way those of us raised Catholic do. Even adult lapsed Catholics, like myself, have more intuitive understanding of the reality of the Catholic Church than converts. Converts actively chose the church because it appealed to their already held sensibilities/morals/world view. As a result, they don’t understand the nuances of being from a deep-rooted culturally Catholic community and family. My extremely devout Catholic grandmother grew up in the Depression in a farm in North Dakota with a dozen siblings. She was a big denouncer of Trump and MAGA, and was a left of center Democrat. Her real life experiences that she or family members had involved abortions, miscarriages, immigration, interracial/intercultural marriages, queer people, poverty and hunger, depending on social programs, domestic violence, untimely tragic deaths, being small business owners, and on and on. The Catholic Church was a community that provided support and guidelines, but there was always the understanding that the rules aren’t strict rules (that’s why Confession is a holy sacrament in the Church) and that decisions in life are not always going to be cut and dry.  All this is to say that Vance might be a more devout Catholic than I am currently, but he’ll never grasp the culture of being Catholic authentically.",Stunning_Put_9189,2025-05-09T12:00:00,46

"All of this creates headaches for JD Vance more than anyone else within Maga. Vance has made his faith part of his political identity as he gears up for a run at the presidency in 2028. Parts of the Maga Catholic faithful are more loyal to Trump than to the Pope, but Francis remained popular among US Catholics, even Republicans, right until his death.  Vance is left, then, required to pay great heed and great attention to the words of the first American Pope – who will surely garner more attention in the US than his predecessor, thanks to his national origin – while having good reason to be sure that he won’t like whatever Leo XIV has to say.  In Leo XIV, the Catholic Church has elevated an American citizen to the papacy, but not one that is from America’s relatively conservative Catholic Church (Prevost hasn’t worked from the US in decades). It is difficult to think of another pick that could have caused more trouble for Maga.  God famously works in mysterious ways.

And then on top of that there’s a pile: his chosen name, work in Peru, the specific Order he’s a member of, the extent of his formal theological education, the fact that some of it was in America, use of the trappings of the church, and the fact that his stated positions on sexuality and gender cannot be interpreted as woke (although there has been no public break with Francis since then, and we can’t assess a pastoral approach).",Marchy_is_an_artist,2025-05-09T19:05:59,1

They also think it's much more traditional than it actually is. And U.S. Catholic converts have no concept of the INTERNATIONAL SCALE of the Catholic Church.   My whole childhood was filled with priests from Ireland, Mexico, Jamaica, India! So much international culture. The acceptance of immigration is very intense.   My grandparents were depression era first generation Americans with German catholic roots. They spent a lot of time supporting charity. For everyone and anyone. Black folks, even queer folks! My grandfather did this until his death in 2005.   JD Vance converted to make himself feel more legitimate. His multiple name changes and lies about his backstory as well as his marrying into an Indian family even though he clearly hates people of color show that he's got no real sense of self.

"No i didn't, I'm not american, I'm italian, so while i might not be up to speed on American politics I'm very much aware of the role of the church in Italian politics. Here, at the historical seat of its power, the church has lost most of its real power and is, basically, a disomogeneous demographic of voters. Once upon a time, the pope forbid catholics from participating in Italian politics, and it didn't really work. I don't really imagine that excommunicating a politician would make that much of a difference in practical terms. It would definitely send a message, but it's a message that would not affect much change in the world, at least in my opinion.",WolfOne,2025-05-09T15:07:04,1
