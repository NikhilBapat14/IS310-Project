">A video clip of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg explaining Social Security Administration (SSA) database issues [on the Flagrant podcast hosted by comedian Andrew Schulz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgx7GvYSq64) has gained major traction online, amassing 2 million views in just one day on X, formerly Twitter.  >The viral clip features Buttigieg, who worked in former President Joe Biden's administration, addressing misconceptions about deceased individuals receiving SSA benefits, clarifying the difference between being listed in a database and actually receiving payments.

"Being able to calmly debunk propaganda like this with a group of people who don’t agree with you is an admirable skill that more politicians need.   Pete has set the example of going into “the lions den” so to speak (Fox News, etc.), and just telling them they’re wrong and why with facts to back it up. All with a smile on his face and with charisma so it doesn’t come across as condescending and is just genuine. Keep it up buddy",realhumanpersonoid,2025-04-27T11:48:26,2082

"You don’t delete historical financial entries from a database because they are records. They’re meant to be immutable. You merely add new information to them. This append-only design is meant to allow for adding new data in a non-destructive manner so at any time a complete picture of what is and what was can be presented in full. Just because data is in a database, does not mean it’s actionable. It does not mean anything is being done with it; it means it’s there to potentially do stuff with by an application. Like issue payments or cancel the issuance of payments. Databases don’t intrinsically do stuff while applications that use databases do. They’re two different and important concepts. Saying there are people in a database from 100 years ago makes absolute sense in any rational world. Saying because they’re in there they’re fraudulent is an absolute lie. If anything, if they were removed, that would be a sign of catastrophic failure or fraud.",VeterinarianJaded462,2025-04-27T14:00:34,46

Pete more than anyone else interests me in 2028 because he has figured out a way to explain things to the American people.

I wish that Pete and maybe AOC together would appeal to the 3% of voters that decide the election of every year.

"Good on Pete for going into the right wing sphere and setting the record straight. However, I only watched the bit of him clarifying the lies from DOGE (I just can’t stand to watch these right-wing comedians) so I’m not sure if he explained how we can actually fix SS. I don’t think he did because most Dems are willfully silent on the solution: raise the SS tax cap and tax the wealthy more for social security.  I love this [video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LRqr7WOb4JE) from The Majority Report. Sam Seder is very passionate about SS and he helps demystify social security: what it is and isn’t, the funding source, why the bottom of it isn’t just going to fall out in a few years, and how increasing the taxes on the rich can replenish social security funding into the future.  So I do give Pete credit but it seems like he didn’t address the primary concerns of most people which are social security running out and younger people’s discontentment with paying into a system that they may not be able to benefit from themselves. Democrats should be campaigning on the rich paying their fair share but that won’t play well with their donor class. *Sigh*",SLVSKNGS,2025-04-27T14:47:01,7

"I'm not a huge Mayor Pete fan, but I genuinely do not understand why he didn't run for President in 2024.  If you look at the 4 years of the Biden Administration, a HUGE emphasis was put on the department of transportation.  A huge part of the IRA bill's focus was on transportation whether it be rebuilding infrastructure or building new infrastructure for EVs.  He was put out front by the administration regularly and got favorable responses from both sides.  Meanwhile Harris was never really pushed to the front.  She didn't really have much of a profile while VP.  Her only real profile was being involved in immigration, which was not seen favorably, by both sides.  Not only that, but if we look at their 2020 campaigns, Pete did better than Harris.  Harris struggled the whole time while Pete was seen as the 3rd candidate behind Biden and Sanders.  Harris made an awful showing in 2020.  So again, I'm absolutely perplexed why Pete didn't run in 2020.  I'm sure it was a party decision, which he accepted, but it doesn't make it less baffling.",rossmosh85,2025-04-27T18:19:21,3

">I really like Pete, but it amazes me that Americans are this fucking dumb that they don't know this already.  When it comes to *virtually any* understanding of Social Security, most Americans are deeply ignorant. Some of the bigger misconceptions:  1. **Social Security is an account that you pay into.** Not in the sense that you are probably thinking. You'll often hear people say things like, ""I could get a better return than that on my own"" or ""just give me back the money that I paid in."" You didn't actually pay any money ""in"" in the sense that you're probably thinking. Social Security is an itemized **tax** that you pay while you are earning an income through wages. You will pay half of this tax and your employer will pay the other half. These days, *all* of that tax is then paid out as a benefit to people who are drawing benefits via old age, disability, as widows, or as orphans. Because the current amount of tax collected is not sufficient to pay all of these benefits, the deficit is made of from funds that were in the Social Security ""trust fund"" which accumulated back when there was a much greater number of workers paying the tax compared to people collecting the benefits that that tax funded. There is no account with your name on it, just a record of the amounts you and your employer have paid in and what your payment of those taxes *may* entitle you to under certain circumstances in the future, such as old age or disability. 2. **Social Security is an investment.** Social Security actually functions much more like an insurance product and the tax that you pay is better thought of as an insurance premium. As illustrated in point 1, there is no actual savings or investment account into which your deposits are placed and invested. Instead, the tax that you pay is used to collectively pay benefits to those who have met certain criteria. There are many cases in which a person in need of benefits might draw upon them having never paid this tax themselves or having paid very, very little. Think of widows, orphans, or the disabled. If Social Security were to function the way that many people seem to think that it does i.e. a personal investment account that you fund, then there would be no money for these people who are the most vulnerable and the most in need. Indeed, that was the point when it was created. This is also the reason that your potential monthly benefit increases the longer you wait to claim your old age benefits. It's effectively an annuity. 3. **Social Security is going to collapse and there will be no more money by 20XX.:** While the so-called ""trust fund"" of surplus tax receipts will eventually reach $0 as we run a deficit based on Social Security taxes currently collected, that does not mean that payments will just stop one day. Going back to point 1 again, *all* of the Social Security tax collected today is paid out directly to those who are collecting benefits, and this will not change. Roughly 70% of benefit payments will continue. Now, that is still a very serious problem that needs to be addressed, but it's not a complete collapse of the system as many people seem to think.",old_french_whore,2025-04-27T12:23:07,111

It's hard to say what he did at McK.  It's entirely possible none of it was evil.  It could be as he frequently describes it, bland PowerPoint and Excel math work.  The problem is, that McK is evil itself.  It is a consulting firm that does a lot of dirty work for capitalism.  And no Democrat, or politician who claims to support the working class, should ever go near it.  Just like Hillary Clinton should have been kicked out of the Democratic party for sitting on Wal-Mart's board, so should McK be an automatic no.  I don't think we should force gay people to go to conversion camps, so I'd never accept a job at Chik-fil-a.  Simple.  This is a great article.

But for me - a lifelong Democratic voter, I don't want him for precisely the reasons laid out in the Atlantic article linked above.  And there's no way for me to believe that a person who worked for a company like that would be willing to work towards legislation that would be truly helpful for workers.

America is falling apart because the bottom 70% of earners don't make shit.  Their lives suck and they see no way out.  Even if I can afford health insurance, I'm terrified when I need it, they'll fuck me and destroy me, both physically and financially.  I know the GOP is going to destroy Social Security and replace it with an entirely different kind of SS.      And I don't want (assuming any future elections are real, which is highly doubtful to me) any more neoliberal, economically right wing Democrats who will fellate billionaires for donations and then tell the working class ""fuck off, the era of big government is over"".  Which really meant ""You're on your own, good luck"".  I'd vote against him in a primary, but if he were the ticket, I'd vote for him and tell all my friends to.

"Ever since I learned about the concept of luxury beliefs, it's made a lot of sense why Kamala likely lost and why I think Pete is better candidate than some of the others being floated around like AOC.  When food is expensive and you'll never be able to buy a house, you are focused on earning enough to eat and maybe have an extra rent payment in your savings account. You don't give two toots about an overseas conflict that Ivy Leaguers are protesting, or who does (or does not) belong on a sports team. Even being pro-choice can be a luxury belief--what's the point of making abortion legal in all 50 states if it's going to cost $2000+ since our healthcare costs are so high?  I'm not saying those beliefs are wrong. But Dems are preaching to the choir of voters who were always going to vote for them in the first place. And Trump's team took advantage of knowing these beliefs are a luxury. The ""Kamala is for they/them"" ad was framed as ""Democrats are sitting caring about DEI and pronouns, while I *care* about making you rich.""   Pete excels at telling people in plain English why policies hurt people and he says it in a way where he's concerned with the common person and expressing empathy about it. But he doesn't throw away Democratic principles entirely, he recognized in the podcast that Black and Brown people will be hurt by tariffs, but he also said ""places like Rural Indiana"" (majority white).",Naraee,2025-04-27T13:56:04,53

And with the upcoming crisis, it's literally just that the current tax revenue collected isn't enough to pay out all the benefits. The SSA has savings built up so it can cover the remainder for now but eventually that savings will be eaten up and they'll only be able to pay equal to what they collect (as you point out it'll be about 80% of total benefits paid out scaling down to around 70% by the end of the century).

It isn't that people think that each person has an individual social security account, it's that they're objecting to the idea that they've spent years if not decades paying a tax for a program that may not be there for them when it was designed to be a permanent institution.

"Pete appeared on the scene like a possible successor to Bernie. He'd written a high school essay talking about Bernie inspiring him, having moral integrity, etc.  But then he turned out to be much more of an incrementalist. He wasn't down to fight for universal single-payer healthcare, for example, but instead wanted a public option. More pragmatic? Maybe. But that's often not how it works. Hillary advocated for the same thing in 2016 after Bernie pushed her to the left and it didn't work for her, so why would it work for Pete?  Pete also took a much higher share of large contributions than Bernie, which made Pete feel more like the corporate guy especially when combined with his McKinsey background.  The real blow though was when Bernie finally picked up *real* momentum in the primaries and the field of moderate Dems all started to drop and endorse Biden to ensure Bernie wouldn't win. Pete followed suit. After writing an essay about how inspiring Bernie was for being uncompromising, Pete compromised and threw his support behind the guy who voted for the war Pete served in rather than the guy who voted against it who he once idolized.  To a lot of folks in the progressive wing, all of this just felt like a betrayal especially as we watched Bernie's chances slipping due to all of Biden's extra support from candidates like Pete and even Warren who felt like they should've been siding with Bernie.",Practical-King2752,2025-04-27T16:59:35,4

I haven't watched JRE in many years but having seen a few clips from his show just recently it seems like that same backpedaling is happening over there, so it's no surprise. Just last week, Joe Rogan is on his show talking about how important Due Process is and how we don't want to become Monsters in the pursuit of fighting Monsters, a surely stark contrast to the party line he was happily spouting before the election.

"The other guy may have needed to fleshed out the details out some more but I agree with their general principle. There's a lot of issues out there that are definitely issues and that people support but won't necessarily get reflected in the way people vote.  The major one that is pretty much always an issue is the economy, so that's never one of these issues. Healthcare I think is another issue that rises to the level of affecting pretty much everybody, if for no other reason than it gets taken out of people's paychecks every month.  For a lot of the rest, most people won't get affected personally by them enough to care, or they might be viewed as distracting people from the things that ""really matter"". DEI in the sense of people playing sports for example, is something that affects some people greatly, but let's not pretend that it's some huge portion of the population who has really strong feelings on it that it's a big voting issue.  Abortion I would argue fits into this second category. It's not that it's not a major issue. But I don't think it rises to the level of the economy and healthcare, but there's lots of people out there who really don't get personally affected by abortion laws. Not saying there aren't lots of people who do get affected very personally and very heavily by these laws, because there absolutely are.

As for the other point, I agree to an extent but in the interview they acknowledge that as well, about how often it's more of an ""emotional"" than ""literal"" promise, one that is more about outlining where your priorities lie.  The issue is that most Democrats, including Pete, do not seem to be able to articulate actionable goals. For instance, Pete meandered about how he wants to wake up and have a nice commute to work. Okay, stop there. How will you have a nice commute if the roads aren't fixed? That's the issue. Don't tell me about your commute; tell me you're going fix the roads.  Gretchen Whitmer literally cited her ""fix the damn roads"" message as why she won. Democrats need to learn from that.

I didn't even have a phone, out of choice, until 2020. I used the internet on a 3DS up until then. It legitimately feels like some of the people I knew used to be smarter in elementary, middle, and high school than now.   All i can say is pre covid was a completely different culture and what's baffling is no one ever mentions it or acts like it ever existed.    But i can tell you having a phone has rotted my brain and every time ive disconnected from social media I've felt better. And I was not born into it. I'm guessing that unconsciously knowing you don't have to remember stuff that you can just look up now does a memory on your ability to abstract and memorize. Which makes me worry about the future generations. I'm also disappointed in what the internet has become, it used to be an augment to real life discussion and discovery, not a replacement.",Steven_Hunyady,2025-04-27T16:05:31,3

"It was the timing of his dropping out that was, at the very least, suspicious.  I’m sure that my memory of the timeline isn’t perfect, but it was something along the lines of:  -Polling showed he wouldn’t win, but stayed in.  -Won Iowa(by a literal coin toss!), which was a Bernie vs. Pete race.  -Dropped out, endorsed Biden.  So progressives were in arms asking why, if he knew so well that even *if* he won Iowa that he still would not win the nomination, would he stay in for Iowa. And thereafter, why would he drop out *after* winning Iowa? The logical conclusion was that he was the best candidate running as a Democrat that could keep Sanders from winning Iowa. That turned out to be true, and despite his “surprise” win in Iowa, he dropped out and endorsed Biden. So he kinda played the “I won’t win, but I’ll knock this other guy down on your behalf” game, and got a cabinet position and elevated his future in politics and his political career by appeasing the party in return.",GameOvaries02,2025-04-27T17:19:29,-1

I think what made him attractive to people was that he had the perfect balancing act as being seen as an 'outsider' but at the same time had the demeanor and decor of a guy running for his second term as president.  But then he very shortly thereafter dropped out to endorse Biden.

"Yeah, Beto couldn’t really shake that one from his campaign. For all intents and purposes, Pete ran a perfect campaign in 2020. His purpose was to get on the map and exceeded that wildly. He was never going to make inroads with minorities and he and everyone else knew that. He just needed a national profile and he could polish it in the future. It’s exactly what he’s doing now. He’s expanding his presence by going on right wing podcasts, talk shows, debates etc. He doesn’t need to be doing it but it’s only helping him. Not sure if you were around here in 2019/2020, but Reddit despised the man (part of this was simply because Bernie was also running). If he can win over Reddit, something’s working. Contrary to most people, I think America is ready to elect a gay man, but unfortunately only _this type_ of gay man. He’s the Tim Cook and Steve Kornacki type. He doesn’t show an ounce of femininity and nobody’s gaydar goes off with him. We elected a black man, a woman won the popular vote, and a large part of this country got behind Kamala. We can do it. To your original that I’ve totally deviated from, guns aren’t the issue. Abortion isn’t even the issue anymore. We have about three years to do two things: 1) Convince the American people that switching to a Republican president did not and will not fix the economy and 2) Curb the push on identity politics. The second part hurts a bit, but it’s a reality. It’s low hanging fruit for Republicans and unfortunately being pushed back on in more than just the US. Preferred pronouns and trans culture specifically are being met with eye rolls and confusion from older demographics. I’m not sure how Pete navigates this one but I trust he could. We just have to not let it identify the party, because Republicans think we’re all non-binary with blue hair. We need to display strong support for inclusion but not lose sight of the ultimate goal of appealing to enough Americans to win an election. Maybe a hot take here on Reddit, but I’ll stand by it.  We need to retake ownership of our party. We’ve allowed Republicans to define us for way too long.

"You shouldn't sit out elections. In the general election, you vote for the Democratic candidate who's on the ballot, because it's a race between the Democrat and the Republican, by virtue of our voting system. Just as important as voting in the general, though, is voting in primary elections; vote your conscience in the primary, and get as many people as possible who share your views to do likewise.  These candidates *can* win. AOC won against an absolutely entrenched establishment Dem, and if she runs for Senate, she'll take that seat in a landslide.  Democratic politicians are gun-shy about leftist voters because they just don't vote. Become a voting bloc that can't be ignored and this'll change. Establishment Democratic politicians chase votes and entrench themselves with corporate money. Corporate money isn't needed to win elections, though; it only takes a committed voting bloc to make it happen.",Lloyien,2025-04-27T15:52:22,21
