"Under the Citizenship Act, subsection 5(4), the relevant Minister (currently the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship) can grant citizenship to any person in special cases. Specifically,  > Despite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.  Likewise, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act section 25.2,  > The Minister may, in examining the circumstances concerning a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, grant that person permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the foreign national complies with any conditions imposed by the Minister and the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations.  The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act authority is limited in Quebec (Quebec has extra authority over immigration compared to other provinces, so both Quebec and the federal Minister have to agree for the special cases handled under 25.2 if the person intends to settle in Quebec). The Citizenship Act authority has no such limits.",cpast,2023-04-15T13:08:36,1
