"""Everyone you know"" isn't representative of union workers in general. Additionally, being involved with a union tends to push you to the left, and particularly away from the Republican party.

">why the discrepancy       I’d say the discrepancy is because you’re using anecdata. Your sample of union members isn’t gathered in any scientific or empirical way, but is exclusively happenstance. It’s impacted by where you live, the types of people you choose to interact with, and any industries you’re professional involved with. There’s sample bias galore.

"Democrats tend to support/back unions.  Republicans tend to support businesses against unions.  Simple as that. Individuals support what they think will help them.  In reality, unions generally lead to better outcomes for all workers. Individuals have potential to perform better on an outside of a union but that's not guaranteed.   History has shown us that employers will take advantage of those it can and work towards their own interests. Unions have been the hedge to give workers more bargaining power against that and done so successfully when politicians have backed them.",korinth86,2024-08-23T10:55:46,5
"Because unions have become severely corrupt over the last few decades. Yes they do good, but there is still a lot of corruption. Not so much in smaller cities/towns. However in the big cities, it’s so apparent it raises a lot of questions. Chicago is one of the biggest examples of this. Pritzker is a billionaire, and all the improvements never seem to be completed. There’s a hundred change orders and renegotiating. I won’t say what my Union is, but we have been directed to not finish projects *on time* quite a few times. The higher ups in the union, always seem to be doing *really really* well, far beyond what their salaries are. Also if the unions have so much money to donate to political campaigns, then they could be using that money to pay the workforce labors more.   I did find it interesting that the Teamsters Union leader was at the RNC this year. Didn’t really watch either, as they are 2 sides of the same corrupt coin. Screwing us and stealing from us one way or another. However when I seen he was speaking I tuned in for that as it was relatable to the American worker.",X_Freakazoid_X,2024-08-24T17:45:15,2

I grew up in a town with a strong automotive union. Most of the members voted based on recommended guidelines and the guidelines generally favored the candidate mostly likely to support or at least not try busting the union. Perhaps I'm just super old or maybe you're speaking to the wrong union members since in the voting booth we all have freedom of choice.   FWIW I've heard people who aren't members or who joined for a job voice support for republicans. Generally they've been the type of talk about personal accountability while benefitting from collective bargaining.,randonumero,2024-08-24T17:01:34,1
"You have to separate out public sector unions, which basically depend on growing government to prosper, and private sector unions, whose members first and foremost need work.    Government protects union leadership, often taking their side in labor disputes.   Democratic policies though often hamper work in construction, manufacturing, and transportation, due to environmental issues and tax policies, so the people who actually need the jobs oppose them.",RingAny1978,2024-08-25T14:03:27,1

My 5th grade teacher taught us this due to his survival training in the Army.  Takeca solid object,  he said they used a coconut. Drill a hole in it. Lash it securely to an unmoveable object.

"My fiance works for the labor union as an electrician and he is a Democrat. I think union members think that they're in that high tax bracket that will get them the tax cut and they won't have to pay as much, but unless you make under $450,000 you're paying 23% if you claim 0 throughout the year. It looks as if there's more coming out because you're making more, but you're still paying the same percentage amount that's what somebody who makes $13 an hour does. I mean as much as minimum wage does. People don't understand the tax cuts go to the 1%.  I read something about people who were in in a branch of the military. My question now is, how do you feel about Trump saying that the presidential medal was the highest metal anyone could receive? He said and here Miriam sits and gets to look beautiful and she didn't have to get shot several times and or killed, so the presidential word is a much higher award. That's disgusting for anyone to say let alone someone who was president and someone who is running for president. I am 100% on what I hear them say not what the news tells me.

Why do people relying on the ACA for life saving medical treatment say they hate Obama care. Also a lot of union workers who didn’t have to fight for the benefits they enjoy feel entitled to them and don’t realize they can be taken away.

"I'm pro-life. I also work in a hospital where I know that the word abort is a medical term. If you have a miscarriage and you're unable to abort the child on your own you have to have a DNC which is considered an abortion. If your tubes are tied and you have a tubulation that's considered an abortion I don't believe in having an abortion just because you don't want to take care of your baby, but what's going to happen is people are going to start having back alley abortions again. In my eyes that's far worse than something that people have already fought for. Then they want to do away with birth control and IVF and you can't have it both ways. If you don't want people to have an abortion before 6 to 8 weeks then you can't whine and complain if you have to help take care of them. Especially, the first three months that they're off of work taking care of their new infant. I just don't think people realize how bad things are going to get regardless if Trump gets an office or not. He's already told us that there will be a bloodbath if he doesn't win and if he does win he's going to be dictator on day one. The United States of America doesn't like to be told what to do but what are you going to do when a tank rolls up on your house?

Also if you read and listen to the Republican policies and  Trumps they're not against IVF or birth control that would be crazy.

You need abortion to be legal because (1) birth control can fail (2) incest and rape happen and (3) there are pregnancies that threaten the health and life of the mother and/or involve fetuses that are non-viable or will be so profoundly disabled that they are beyond the capacity of the parents to care for,Mysterious-Fan2944,2024-08-29T19:06:26,3
Exactly. I don't have a problem with people that don't like Trump and I totally understand why you wouldn't like him. But I also don't understand the need to make up lies about him when he can sabotage himself without the lies.   And Roe got overturned because it is unconstitutional and abortion is not the role of the federal government. Granted I don't think there should be a ban on abortion anywhere and if the Republicans were smart (and they rarely are) a moderate solution could happen in every state but some states decided on a full ban instead. And other states allow abortion up until birth.  Although the situation is a mess now I expect every state to allow abortion in some form in a few years once it is put to a vote by the people.
