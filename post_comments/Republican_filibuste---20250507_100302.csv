"What is this? People are bad and could deceive us? This has always been the case and we have lived with it for centuries. However, the benefit seems to me to be higher than the risk of fraud. Firstly, you can do something about it and secondly, there is not as much cheating as is always claimed. Well, if you're not a Republican, because they mess up every statistic.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-07T10:13:42,18
"Does anyone really think that preventing ""absent parents"" is a real concern of these pathetic excuses for lawmakers? Nahhh... we all know that their true objective is to make absolutely sure that the disadvantaged members of their constituency are kept from being able to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. You know... by making sure that the ""peasants"" can never earn enough to be able to infiltrate those lawmakers' standard of living.",phosdick,2025-05-07T11:28:17,8
That is the biggest bunch of bullshit I have ever heard.,chpbnvic,2025-05-07T10:22:37,6
What they mean is that moms will be able to work and be financially independent so they can leave bad relationships and not be dependent on a man.  They HAVE to prevent that!,TheRoadkillRapunzel,2025-05-07T12:45:49,4
"They oppose the bill because they want women to stay home:  >Coleman offered an amendment to give a $10,000 tax credit per child to stay-at-home parents, saying she thought the underlying bill “literally devalued being a homemaker and being a mother.” The Senate rejected her proposal.  >Speaking during Tuesday’s debate with Republican state Sen. Jill Carter of Granby, Coleman said she was a lawmaker and a lawyer but “first and foremost” a homemaker and mother.  >Carter liked Coleman’s proposed amendment, adding she had been a stay-at-home mother while her husband worked two jobs. She thought child care tax credits could prompt some parents to send children to day care.  >“I wondered what it is that we’re incentivizing,” she said. “Are we incentivizing parents leaving their kids more? Or do we want change, for parents to be able to be more engaged in their children’s lives?”",RuinedbyReading1,2025-05-07T10:20:52,3
Ever get the sense that the reason they bring up these worries is because they are the type of people who would do these underhanded things themselves?,katyadc,2025-05-07T11:38:27,3

So we only care an out the child until it’s born!!,Acrobatic-Bluejay-79,2025-05-07T15:35:26,2
Good. Those freeloading kids can go out and get jobs to pay for their own care.   /s,Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-07T10:20:07,1

"This is the Republican mindset. If they feel that some random person can abuse a system, they will destroy the system. Look at any number of social programs. Or my favorite, national healthcare. They will rail on about how they don't want to pay for someone else's healthcare. Yet they don't acknowledge that by the nature of insurance, you're already paying for other peoples healthcare. Or they will step it up a notch and refuse it because they don't want to pay for someone's healthcare who might be unemployed. So, because some people might get free healthcare while unemployed, they would rather let insurance companies profit massively while people who DO work hard for their insurance get denied in the name of profit. Absolutely wild.",orion19819,2025-05-07T10:19:47,12
They didn't object because of fraud. They objected because it makes it easier for women to work outside of the home.,RuinedbyReading1,2025-05-07T10:22:47,8
A progressive will feed a hundred people on the chance that one of them is starving.  A conservative will starve a hundred people on the chance that one of them already had lunch.,Hestia_Gault,2025-05-07T19:42:45,4
She should be acting as a civil servant first and foremost. Politicians really don't seem to understand  their purpose.,RedactedLactic,2025-05-07T10:56:18,3
Well yeah. When you are freeloading. You steal from the collective. The collective money and resources should be strictly guarded at all times. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-07T10:22:04,-6
"You could also argue that supporting the part of society that is ""freeloading"" benefits society as a whole. Because disenfranchised people have the hardest time pulling themselves up, we should allow them basic opportunities to relieve hardship and potentially become productive.",RedactedLactic,2025-05-07T10:52:19,9
So let’s cut off all the red states freeloading on the successful economies of the blue states.,Hestia_Gault,2025-05-07T19:43:53,2
"Also, nothing lets you freeload harder than having all the money... Republicans are all about hoarding collective resources.",StarInTheMoon,2025-05-07T14:28:06,6
