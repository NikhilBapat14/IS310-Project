"U.S. Senators Jim Banks (R-IN) and Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) introduced bipartisan legislation that would protect women’s spaces on college campuses.   The legislation seeks to protect single-sex spaces and women’s organizations, specifically sororities.  Why are they not protected already?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-15T15:58:44,12

This legislation is to stop.groups from being FORCED to accept the opposite gender.  The boy scouts decided for themselves to CHOOSE to accept girls to try and combat declining enrollment.   Completely unrelated.,NotRadTrad05,2025-04-22T07:13:22,1

"The sad part is less than 4 years later, the Boy Scouts were sued for sexual abuse for 2.46 Billion forcing them into bankruptcy.  Sorry yes the lawsuit to allow girls in did fail. I thought it had succeeded because they ultimately let in girls. And yet... we see what happened afterwards above.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-22T11:03:30,0
