"As a libertarian, I don’t support what they did. Watch the video. The sheriff steps away and has plainclothes security guards drag her out instead as she asks them if they’re deputies and for their names. As cringe and hyperbolic as she was being screaming “assault” at the very beginning, it doesn’t take away from the fact that plainclothes non-deputized security who didn’t identify themselves did physically drag her away at the behest of a law enforcement official. That’s over the line and I wouldn’t want democrats or republicans approving of that. The question of whether she should have been allowed to stay is debatable. The method though, is clearly some bootlicker nonsense. ",dayda,2025-04-22T12:32:24,533
"As they should be. They’re not law enforcement officers and it was a public venue. They are not allowed to touch or remove someone, just like you or I are not allowed to do so. Whoever hired the public security firm is probably looking at a lawsuit too. ",StuckInMyPants,2025-04-22T19:33:42,428
"Discovery better include video that shows what happened before the guards picked her up.  I haven't looked very hard, but have yet to see what was happening before that moment.  Common sense tells me that would be very important to one side of the case, which side depends on what it shows.",enslaved1,2025-04-22T22:21:07,-105

I am pretty sure they can actually but just can’t make actual arrests.,Luna920,2025-04-23T19:33:47,-6
Her along with a bunch of others went there to be a nuisance.  This is just how things are going to be from here on out.  Lefty loosers melting down and spoiling everything for everybody.   Spoiled brats.,murderinthedark,2025-04-23T15:56:18,-5
"With how the brigade is downvoting you and how few comments are being shown, I think you might be on to something. There is probably more to this story and important context missing.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-23T07:10:09,-30
You're crazy if you think private citizens have the right to physically remove another law abiding private citizen from a public venue.   FAFO,Silly-Safe959,2025-04-25T07:36:32,22
I mean licenses private security officers can make citizens arrest and detain someone until police arrive.,Luna920,2025-04-25T15:27:01,-5
