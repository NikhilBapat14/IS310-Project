Lol these people are so fucking unserious. We have much bigger problems then rehashing which democrats we blame for the election.     Liberals blame leftists. leftists blame liberals.     Everyone needs to get the fuck over themselves.,jackofslayers,2025-05-09T17:44:37,35

"Counter argument we should stop listing to anyone related to the Obama administration. it was Obama people that push for Hillary, manage Harris campaign and allow for decay of Democrats party at the state level. I might go far enough to say they are responsible for Trump, since Obama failure after the recession to bring real change let to frustration that brought Trump to power. I also don’t understand their hatred for Biden. They all quietly support him until the debate, never question his age for three years until mainstream media decides that Biden aged what more important that Trump criminal activity.",Someguy0304,2025-05-10T11:13:33,1

"The DNC is to blame as he wasn’t calling the shots for awhile. I truly cannot forgive the DNC and his admin for gaslighting America about his condition. Anyone who has cared for or witnessed an elder succumb to dementia knew what they were looking at even before the debate. My extended family of mixed politics discussed how he was mimicking our late grandfather who descended down the same tragic health path. I was shocked, pissed, and ultimately relieved that they were essentially capitulating by agreeing to a debate vs Trump because I knew what was going to happen. I was pissed because they were knowingly punting on a prayer that Biden would have a “good night”. Even more pissed when DNC heads tried to continue the farce by saying “oh he just had a bad debate night.” Imagine the global fallout of another 4 years of a lame duck President. We’d be getting walked around by the rest of the world, especially the rogue super powers and groups who fully took advantage of a weak President/admin. I made a lot of money arbitraging betting odds against Biden, for Kamala, and ultimately piling in on election night for Trump to win. Was free money to anyone paying attention. DNC needs a restructuring desperately and admitting to their fuckup with Biden, along with actually letting authentic candidates to be elected, would be a good start.",BootyBruisers,2025-05-09T23:58:59,1

"it is relevant because many Democrat donors/leadership/upper-class voters want to sit in denial, and want to run a second Biden with the same platform, if not the same name.  But that is also a problem caused by older voters who just...can't handle the thought of voting for someone younger, with different views to their own. Boomers wax poetic about ""compromise"" but on;y actually support compromise so long as it is ""socially appropriate"" for them to do so.",ragingreaver,2025-05-10T13:58:42,1
They're responding to Biden's new press tour where he said he would've won the race. The podcaster also commented it wasn''t fair to Kamala Harris. So spread that blame around.,QuickBenTen,2025-05-09T17:53:13,16
"The unserious people are the ones pretending that a Dem party whose primary goal is defending the ultra rich and corporate interests shouldn't be criticized.   The Weimar Democrats are the reason we're here today. They're the ones that saw the last convincing Dem win, Obama in 2008, and then decided the progressive platform and rhetoric Obama used shouldn't be repeated. They deliberately choose to take politically weaker positions and undercut the progressive wing to protect the donor class.   If they aren't replaced with people who actually fight for the working class, America is well and truly doomed. Hell, we might already be doomed anyways, but the only possible path out of authoritarianism is progressive reform. Nothing else will save us.",PolygonMan,2025-05-09T20:19:40,10

"Oh man could I not disagree more.  A Democratic candidate who comes out of an open primary absolutely sweeps 2024.  That a Republican won the popular vote for the first time in decades and they didn’t sweep both chambers of Congress is proof enough that Trumpism really isn’t popular.  It’s more that Biden presided over the electoral death of neoliberalism and Kamala paid the price.  Kamala ran as a Biden surrogate.  ‘No daylight’ is the term Biden used about her campaign.  That would not have been what came out of the primary, whoever that may have been.  It would have been a rejection of Biden, not more of him, and that absolutely would have registered with voters.",SantorumsGayMasseuse,2025-05-09T17:53:36,-4

It’s very convenient for the DNC to paint 2024 as unwinnable, because the alternative is the reality where we all have to reckon with what incompetent feckless buffoons they are.",SantorumsGayMasseuse,2025-05-09T18:45:07,3
And compare that with Trump gaining 3 million votes. Trumpism is more popular than ever. An Obama level win isn’t needed for the country to embrace Trumpism. They got house and senate control and won the popular vote too. So,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-09T18:48:29,0

"Yeah, and the margin of Trump’s victory stayed home for the Democrats because they sucked in 2024, it’s not complicated.  Biden wasn’t even all that popular and he beat Trump’s 2024 turnout.  I guess by your logic Biden had a mandate to remake the US in his image and just…squandered it?  Trumpism is underwater in approval ratings and by all accounts the midterms are going to be a wipeout.  They have such a slim majority that JD Vance has had to step in to tie break their keystone legislation.  They’ve had to strategically hold votes at times their members were in town because they don’t have the numbers if people leave to fundraise.  Not good stuff if you’re trying to run an agenda. ",SantorumsGayMasseuse,2025-05-09T19:07:31,1

"A mandate and the country embracing Trumpism are 2 separate things imo. And, no I don’t think Biden had anywhere near the ability to make the country in his image simply because he doesn’t have a cult following, which leads me to the next point: underwater approval ratings don’t matter for a cult.   Midterms probably won’t even be a wipeout unfortunately simply because democrats are too busy fighting and republicans will always guarantee that their base goes out to vote. And it’s not like republicans have to work too much to fundraise either, they got the billionaires, the media,  and their loyal followers to give them money at any point.",Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-09T19:15:45,-1
"Biden didn't remake the country in his image because he 1) doesn't have an image, he is a vessel for neoliberalism and 2) was a senile old man for most of his term.    I agree about approval ratings, and I don't think they really matter for anyone.  Biden spent most of his term deep underwater and the Democrats did just fine in his midterm.  Until something changes I don't think *any* president for the foreseeable future is going to have a positive approval rating for any appreciable amount of time.    But it's not just the approval number I am pointing to.  By the midterms shelves are going to be empty and everything is going to cost 25% more.  Americans are very aware of their wallets right now, and outside of a small contingent the Republican voter base is not actually prepared for the amount of inflation that Trump is going to inflict with tariffs in the coming months.  You're right, the Democrats have spent the months since the election left-bashing and trying to tell everyone it's not their fault.  That's why it's going to be the least deserved majority in the history of American electoral politics.  They've presented nothing.",SantorumsGayMasseuse,2025-05-09T19:34:12,3
Democrats only did well in the midterms because republicans supported the overturning of Roe.   I still think that most republican voters and independents are gonna vote the same way come the midterms because Trump tells them to. They voted like that even after the pandemic and the economic collapse afterwards. Nothing that the democrats present is gonna change anything because Americans are too in love with fascism and billionaires.,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-05-09T19:41:22,1
