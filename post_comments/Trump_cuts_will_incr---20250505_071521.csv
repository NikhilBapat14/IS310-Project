">Layoffs and funding cuts to Fema and Noaa will hamstring emergency managers, warns professor Samantha Montano  The fucked up thing is that there are many people in North Carolina who voted for Trump because they were unhappy with FEMA after Hurricane Helene, an unhappiness that was fueled partly by right wing propaganda.",zsreport,2025-05-05T07:17:07,36
"This is going to hurt his red states more than blue right? More of them are in disaster prone areas, and they are largely poorer so the states have fewer financial resources to make up for the loss.",RobertoPaulson,2025-05-05T08:37:07,11

Thank god US isn't located where there is issues with disasters like Hurricanes and such.  Big brain move by Trump to cut this.  /s,JeRazor,2025-05-05T10:04:57,5

Almost time for a few huge hurricanes to rip through some red states. Can’t wait to see if Trump even shows up to toss out paper towels. Don’t worry though there will be plenty of AI images of Trump saving puppies and kittens from the flood waters to keep MAGA in line.,Jagermonsta,2025-05-05T11:03:01,3

"I don't want to wish ill will on anyone but I hope hurricanes and tornadoes are particularly devastating over the next few years because until Trump voters (even the moderate ones) feel the effects of the Republican Party's policies *personally* and *hard*, they'll never even consider changing their vote.",atreeismissing,2025-05-05T12:58:10,2

They think FEMA was supposed to make them 100% whole over a weekend. That's not what FEMA does and the devastationof Helene will take years to fix what is even possible to fix.,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-05T08:43:11,15

"He literally denied Arkansas aid after their flooding despite Huckabee Sanders spewing lies for him as press secretary during his first term.  Believe me I thought he would target blue states and areas too, but Trump's policies are going to hurt rural Americans more than anyone else.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-05T09:24:58,9
"My mom was basically crying to my brother, saying how they've basically been abandoned by FEMA since Trump took office.  Bro's compulsive response was to repeat some talking points he heard. ""That's just fake news, the government lies to you anyway, that's just people being anti-Trump, etc""  My mom wasn't even trying to discuss politics, she was simply explaining her experience and the info that *FEMA THEMSELVES* have been updating her with.",Akairuhito,2025-05-05T14:22:02,4
"California at least has the economy to self fund, it’ll suck and push further the question of independent governance but they’ll survive. South Carolina and Florida on the other hand… ",RVAteach,2025-05-05T10:51:05,6
Rural areas are always going to be hurt the most by what Trump does. There's no incentive for him to give a single shit about them. The government is pushing for states to fund their own stuff instead of the fed but red states straight up cannot afford it. Those states aren't going to spend money to rebuild small towns and his voters are going to see that first hand.,Spanklaser,2025-05-05T11:03:03,5
"Because he has never liked poor red necks. And now that they can’t vote for him and it won’t be a big news story, he can comfortably abandon them.",Traditional-Goal-229,2025-05-05T15:01:41,2
