Figures….the party that makes up genders is now the party that makes up symbols,Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-08T04:35:46,129
"Damn it, without even checking I know my state is taking part it this woke ‘resistance’ crap. Sucks beyond comprehension.",Any-Passion8322,2025-05-08T21:26:41,3
">""My intent is to represent our city's values and honor our dear diverse residents who make up this beautiful city and the legacy of pain and progress that they have endured,"" she continued.  ...legacy of pain and progress?   I would argue that most of the pain in this community has been self-inflicted. This group that ""just wanted to be left alone to be their authentic selves"" have spent years forcing their ideology into our schools, our government, our places of work, and our homes. And stunts like this, a city government giving unearned, preferential treatment to this community, will not help their cause.",Farmwife64,2025-05-08T06:45:20,76
I think the funny thing is people adopting the rainbow flag for autism.,AppState1981,2025-05-08T06:34:50,37
"I don't agree with the ideals they're promoting, but I gotta admit the commitment to trolling got a chuckle out of me.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-08T06:55:51,33
The only flag that should be used is the American Flag,Erotic-Career-7342,2025-05-08T22:23:48,3
"Well, I would just let the citizens react to that. If they don't like it, they can vote these idiots out. I think it was a petulant move for them to do this. When Biden was in charge, they wanted everybody to fall in line with whatever he wants. When Trump is in charge, all of a sudden no one should listen to the president lol.",BossJackson222,2025-05-08T21:45:00,2
"It’s almost June ( pride month), get  ready for everything to be about that particular group of people. They are long passed getting their public acceptance and rights they have so wanted. Say one critical thing, or spout anything biblical and people are instantly banned from social media. Now it’s about force feeding the public and especially religious folks to not only accept it, but rejoice in it.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-08T16:06:24,2
"No to mention the botched 2020 census:  Undercounted:   * Arkansas (-5.04), * Florida (-3.48), * Illinois (-1.97), * Mississippi (-4.11), * Tennessee (-4.78), and * Texas (-1.92).  Overcounted   * Delaware (+5.45), * Hawaii (+6.79), * Massachusetts (+2.24), * Minnesota (+3.84), * New York (+3.44), * Ohio (+1.49), * Rhode Island (+5.05), and * Utah (+2.59)   Note: this was done on Republicans watch, so I'm not suggesting any type of conspiracy.",BryanFnR,2025-05-08T10:49:27,16
All symbols are made up though.,zorakthewindrunner,2025-05-08T07:19:44,101
And here I thought the American Flag represents all that.,Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-08T09:24:03,25
Problem is that all administration have a left wing bias.,red-african-swallow,2025-05-08T11:33:59,8
I seem to recall the Deep State working at every turn to stop Trump from fixing things he knew was going to be a problem and the Dem run House backed them up.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-08T11:54:17,5

*The Vexillology subreddit disliked that.*,MulticamTropic,2025-05-08T07:45:19,28
"I learned some new words today. This from Wikipedia: ``` A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, one who designs flags is a vexillographer, and the art of designing flags is called vexillography. A hobbyist or general admirer of flags is a vexillophile. ```",zorakthewindrunner,2025-05-08T08:18:20,16
"Check out the vexillology subreddit, it’s actually pretty interesting!",MulticamTropic,2025-05-08T08:54:14,12
