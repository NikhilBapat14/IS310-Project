"We need more local protests.   I've been pushing for more actions (demonstrations, informational picketing, leafleting, etc.) in front of the home district and home state offices of GOP US House and Senate members. They may be avoiding constituents by cancelling town halls, but you can still bring your complaints to them or at least their staffers.   Republicans on Capitol Hill need to be made to worry more about the general election in November 2026 than about some hypothetical MAGA primary challenger next year.   Constituents in districts won by Republicans with narrow margins in 2024 have a tremendous amount of leverage which other Americans don't have. Use that power if you live in such a district.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-20T00:01:31,2

"I went into a regular political sub today (not /liberal or /democrat) and, boy, has the tide completely turned on Trump I read wonderful comments such as, ""I bet he bankrupted lemonade stands has a young child..."" and ""He's such a coward... he gets ""tough"" on something and then backs off... every single time... ""   As of today, he has a whopping approval rating of 37%...   America just couldn't vote for the black woman, now could we?",_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-04-23T12:46:09,1
