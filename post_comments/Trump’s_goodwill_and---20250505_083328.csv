"I'm tired of cynical takes on Trump's disapproval levels.   It matters if we make it matter. Lower approval is better than higher, since it makes it easier for people and institutions to not obey in advance.

"People taking down Trump flags, removing yard signs and bumper stickers are out of self-preservation/embarrassment, not generally because they've changed their mind or soured on Trump. Sure, some probably were tacit Trump supporters, vote Republican every election, resonate with the GOP, and they have likely changed their minds, but MAGA supporters =/= Republican supporters nor does Embarrassment = Change of Heart.   Right now we are witnessing these people start to go back into the closet with their hate and fear, again, because it's embarrassing to be a public, easy-to-spot Trump supporter. They are aware people are angry with Trump and people who voted for him, they are aware that his policies are hurting people they did not intend, that does ***not*** mean they entirely or even partially regret their choice. They're trying to avoid confrontations with their neighbors and at the grocery store out of safety and ease.   Now once the economy is in the shitter and everything is astronomically expensive, people (including them) lose their jobs, homes, etc, ***then*** we *may* see people start to turn heel pretty quick. Make no mistake, this isn't dismissing the growing anti-Trump sentiment and how his approval ratings and goodwill are decreasing daily. He needs to get at or below 25% before Congress starts taking sincere action. We are approaching that threshold, but not fast enough. Once the economic pain becomes blatantly apparent and the suffering is harsh, swift, and deep, then we should see an accelerated and precipitous drop in support and more public outcry against him. Once GOP reps recognize people on the whole hate Trump and he's a losing horse, they will betray him and the admin and try to keep their positions, safety and power by dumping Trump/MAGA.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-05-05T13:45:51,1

They just need him to think he's the king so he keeps all of our attention while the real traitors are free to dismantle and sell off whatever they want.    Trump said he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and not lose a vote.

"When we say to eat them, we don't usually mean millionaires.  [Modestly-]Millionaires are still invested in their communities, often own their own small businesses and take care of their labor (usually), they make donations even for the sake of deductions, or they work, genuinely hard for their wealth (often skilled in trades, even union, and took a chance, or spent most of a decade on secondary education). They usually respect law and order, and take pride in their hospitality and remember the grind - they make their kids study hard or go to work with them and learn to be useful, even if they have nice things at home. Their favorite thing about their money is their kids won't have to struggle and they won't die at work - despite maybe even being workaholics. At worst, they may fall into the ""bootstraper"" categories, even if preferring people get a fair shake, due to still preferring personal liberty and human decency.  Big millionaires, and those on the way to billionaires forget what it's like to be human. They don't live in neighborhoods, they buy mansions, estates, or penthouses, their children don't go to school so they don't care about rising tides, because even if they hate their kids they care about their wealth and legacy so the kids are set for life. They don't need to work so they put their names on buildings and the people below them make them richer. They don't care about the law when they can pay the fine or buy the judge, and if you're not benefiting them you're better off disappearing than becoming a target. They wield corruption as a tactic; it is virtually impossible to be a decent billionaire (*through the eye of the needle*).  I think the average American forgets that a million dollars isn't wealth anymore, when you can't buy a modern car for less than $50k, pay $2500 for rent, and still have to pay $4k for a dentist with good insurance. Millionaires need to pay attention to the world around them or they'll be about as broke by retirement unless they are actual boomers with locked in pensions. Don't get me wrong. I haven't earned a total of a million in my whole life. A few a mere few thousand dollars would be a windfall for me and my family.
