"That’s what he promised. I mean this is the shadiest man alive who can’t be trusted, unless of course it involves his ego and inflicting harm and injustice.",Physical-Object8171,2025-05-10T14:19:00,1
"From the article:  A former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who criticized President Trump in his first term said in a new interview that he thinks he was right to be concerned that the president would seek “revenge” upon his return to office.  “My concern was he would turn the government into a revenge machine, and that’s what’s happening,” Miles Taylor, former deputy chief of staff at DHS during the first Trump administration, said in an interview with NBC News.  Last month, Trump signed a memorandum directing the Department of Justice to investigate Taylor, who wrote a New York Times op-ed and later a book under the pseudonym “Anonymous” about how some officials were working to thwart Trump’s impulses during his first term.  White House staff secretary Will Scharf said at the time that the memo would strip any active security clearance for Taylor and would direct the Justice Department “to investigate his activities to see what else might come up in that context given his egregious behavior during your previous administration.”  “I know I’ve never broken the law. I know that I’ve assiduously upheld my national security obligations,” he said. “What’s really important for people to know is you don’t need a permission slip in the United States to criticize the president.”  Taylor said he knows of instances of government officials contacting former high school classmates and other associates, saying to NBC News, “I have seen indications that they are out there, rummaging through my past, talking to people as far back as high school and trying to comb through my life.”",kootles10,2025-05-10T14:05:05,1

"Michael Cohen, wrote a book about Trump's obsession with Revenge,  he doesn't move on!!",timetogetoutside100,2025-05-10T14:31:32,1
He said while campaigning he would seek vengeance against those he feels wronged him. He's simply following through with what he promised. I'm surprised he hasn't conjured up ways to have his naysayers arrested. Maybe he needs to get some more tips from Putin — he has revenge down to a fine art.,invalidpassword,2025-05-10T14:27:21,1

"If the term justice means anything, it has to mean that Trump must be made to face serious criminal charges for all his vile actions.   For the scale and heartlessness of his crimes, for all the pain he has caused and for the mind-blowing levels of corruption he demonstratres on a daily basis, he needs to be put on trial and see out the rest of his life from behind bars.",crazybones,2025-05-10T16:30:10,1

"It’s what his base wants, too. All of their frustrations, failings, regrets, and fears have been projected onto other people, and they want to harm them. That’s the whole game and it has been for a while. ",AvEptoPlerIe,2025-05-10T14:39:35,1
"It's been so obvious he is mobbed up and has been for decades. Russian mob, who are basically controlled by the KGB/FSB, too.  Media can't admit this to themselves because otherwise the whole charade comes crashing down.",MagicianHeavy001,2025-05-10T17:29:35,1
