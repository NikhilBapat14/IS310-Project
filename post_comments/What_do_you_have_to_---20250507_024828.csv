"First step is a basic understanding of the system. The structure of the Constitution, your state system, basic US history and learn how to vote.  Next step is seeking information to inform your views. Not just taking in other people's opinions to adopt as your own or simply conforming with an identity. But truly thinking about issues and understanding how they affect you and other people in society.   Seems to me that many people never get past step one and instead think that they're working on step two as they watch opinion shows on cable news.",LookAtMeNow247,2025-05-07T21:40:40,18
"Honestly as someone who has a graduate degree in public policy, even knowing the basics of how legislation is passed would be helpful. Regardless of party affiliation, I commonly hear people bemoan of a party controlling the senate and not understanding why a bill wasn’t passed. The bare minimum is just understanding the mechanics of it and even at a high level is more than what we have now.",Randy_Watson,2025-05-07T21:36:48,30
"My dad was a history major and taught government  in high school and college.  He loved politics and truly a well-informed independent.  He always told me that if I really want to know what’s going on in Politics is to sit a watch the live feeds of the Congressional floor and be knowledgeable of the bills being voted on.  My dad did this, he sat in his recliner watching C-SPAN all afternoon.  No way in hell do I do that, haha, but the point was that you’ll actually see what Congress is doing and voting on, you’ll never get a straight answer from them otherwise.",ButtScratchies,2025-05-07T21:21:09,10
my father used to read the talking points from Time magazine cover stories/politics editorials at dinnertime. Im not sure how much deeper than that that he understod politics but it made us aware it was a thing and was important and as adults all of my siblings are well-informed politically,Ok-Fly9177,2025-05-07T21:48:12,4

"*Parties spend tons of money on Think tanks that consist of people with Ivy league degrees to to come up with their policy positions.*  When we're lucky. Most likely they rely on how the issue is polling with their voting base, with input from party leaders and the donor class.   *Can we agree that not being uninformed lies somewhere in the middle.*  In the middle of what?",The_B_Wolf,2025-05-07T21:40:21,6
"Frankly, people should pay so much more attention at the state and local level first. Setting aside that there are consequential things happening now at the federal level, most of them are being driven by the executive branch and even for the legislative stuff there is little to be done to slow down these shifts. It's also easy to get lost in the weeds on issues that have no hope of moving.  State and local politics though? Tend to be more straightforward, have real and understandable impacts for your community and state, have so few people interacting on the issues that you can legitimately make your voice heard, and are closer to you and more accessible. If you hear about a bill that concerns you, you can actually organize a group of people to testify on the bill and often testify in front of the committee yourself. Try doing that in front of Congress.",See-A-Moose,2025-05-08T07:50:22,3
"You have to do the research.  You need to take an interest on how things work.  The media uniformly wants to make you believe something.  That is usually somewhat misleading but mostly technically true.    I will give an example.  The way the Medicare and Medicaid is funded.  The government sets rules for participation.  Then those participants use it, and the doctors and medical establishment bills it.  You cannot predict exactly how much will be spent, which is why we have such a big problem  So when they say the Republican led Congress wants to cut Medicaid or Medicare, they cannot really.  They can only tighten the rules.  So an honest debate would be about the rules not saying that they want to cut so many billon.     The point is you need to already know how Medicaid and Medicare are NOT budgeted to understand.",kenmele,2025-05-10T14:23:00,1
Hate elitism but we are in this complete mess because of voters who can't find Mexico or Canada on a map but deemed KH as lacking presidential stature.. 5 to 10% of Trump voters,Rivercitybruin,2025-05-07T23:28:22,1
"Politicians at the end of the day make and ratify laws. To understand politics is to understand why and how politicians work and have worked.   A good background in law and what’s normal there that looks performative if it were used in normal language would be the best possible thing, followed by a solid understanding of history. I think after that at least a surface level understanding of whatever the law in question is regulating helps. ",moonlets_,2025-05-07T22:31:08,1
"Too many people just believe what their 'party' tells them (confirmation bias) and stop there (due to laziness?).   I see this on both sides.  I was a debate nerd in high school.  I think you need to know enough to articulate the opposition views with the same veracity as your own.  You should be able to do this across a variety of 'political topics': abortion, education policy, healthcare, gun control, war, etc.",ipas_and_apis,2025-05-08T05:33:23,1
"I think it's important to recognize the biases and slant present within the media we consume. I personally use gauges like a [Bias Meter](https://www.biasly.com/bias-meter-how-it-works/), which helps detect misinformation and the speaker's general opinions",Ok_Map9434,2025-05-08T22:14:49,1
"Education, but more specifically, *adept media intuition and literacy,* by far. I'm of the view that the poor media literacy is the single greatest threat to healthy social and political discourse. There is a stunning lack of curiosity in the pursuit of truth and understanding. Most people cannot think in abstracts while being unwilling to listen to experts. They struggle in dissonance arousing situations. There's a Dunning-Kruger epidemic in the online era of media consumption. Furthermore, this problem transcends politics. Many people cannot absorb and digest the complexities and nuance of a fictional narrative to save their lives. They have to be explicitly told what to think and feel, like children, and they very often *miss the point* entirely.",_Age_Sex_Location_,2025-05-09T06:24:47,1
"Being “not uninformed” perhaps means being politically literate: aware of how the system works, able to seek out and evaluate information, and equipped to make thoughtful choices. Let's start with the premise that we need to understand the impact that policies, values (or lack of values), and lawmakers have on our daily lives. Can we focus on critical thinking? Can we spend more than the flick of a screen to learn?",mikadouglas1,2025-05-09T08:30:40,1

"Shout out to my high school government teacher who had the class try and pass a bill with aspects that favored some of the students’ imaginary constituents, but not others’ and vice versa. It demonstrated how often campaigns tend to say that an opposing candidate voted against something that would seem favorable when they were voting against an unfair bill in its entirety. It’s easy to forget that the mechanics of government are (supposed to be) truly fiddly and nuanced",GarfieldLoverBoy420,2025-05-08T12:58:29,2
It is very annoying listening to opinions on policy when people don’t understand the process.   It happens most often with local issues when people blame the wrong authority for the gripe they have. ,10ft3m,2025-05-08T23:00:08,2
"I mean honestly watching C-SPAN is not a bad idea, but I would not advise watching floor sessions that much, I would start with committee sessions. Same for your state legislature where the changes are going to have a larger impact on you. The floor sessions are governed by rules that can often be difficult to understand just from watching at least at the Federal level. The committee sessions tend to be more straightforward. I also recommend focusing more on state and local politics because those impacts are likely going to affect you sooner and don't get the attention they need to.",See-A-Moose,2025-05-08T07:43:00,6
"My nieces are 12 and 13 years old. They came to visit us a couple of years ago in Austin, TX, and the state legislature was in session.   We took them to watch the state senate from the gallery. My oldest niece asked, ""What are they doing?"" I said, ""Making laws. Right now."" And her eyes went wide as saucers.   It was objectively boring to watch, but they stayed interested for about 30 minutes. That was a really neat moment.",Conscious_Raisin_436,2025-05-09T18:43:51,2

In the middle of the 2 levels.   Level 1: As smart as people in think tanks with Ivy League degrees. Knowing how glass steagal being repealed led to the 2008 recession. Knowing what a subprime mortgage is. Understanding what the 'vacuum’ is when talking about pulling troops out of Iraq. Knowing the history of gun control legislation.   Level 2: not knowing the 3 branches of our government. Not knowing who the vice president is. Not knowing which states are red states and which states are blue states. ,bgoodwin956,2025-05-07T22:29:56,1

"Personally, I would define it as:   1) Understand the three branches of government both at the state and federal level. Understand what a president or governor's job is, what Congress does, how they pass laws, and the role of the courts.   2) You've checked on state and federal political news (from a reputable source like Associated Press or Reuters) within the last month.   That, to me, qualifies you as informed.",Conscious_Raisin_436,2025-05-09T18:46:29,2
