"Remember this drawing from his trial?  He put it on his website.  Trump, not Jesus.   https://preview.redd.it/nst94t4iktye1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=08ed92101d1c12786e37f78a4b6c71f3ad51fa28  And on a side note, it figures that a Republican would depict Jesus as a white guy.",tinyE1138,2025-05-04T14:49:25,41
"Disclaimer: Bad Catholic here  As soon as I read Dolan said, Trump “didn’t have anything to do with that”, that was far enough into the article. No one will hold this stupid fuck responsible for anything said, done, posted, tweeted, etc., by him personally or in the name of the US.   Bad Catholic, but I do have daily thoughts and prayers for one thing to happen.",696D726564646974,2025-05-04T15:15:58,25
"Before heading off to the conclave to elect a new pope, Cardinal Dolan criticized Donald Trump for the AI image depicting Trump as a pope. Dolan is seen as an ally of Trump though he apparently hasn't yet sunk to the level of obsequiousness demonstrated by Capitol Hill Republicans.   Apart from Trumpian ego, it's baffling what benefit a non-Catholic serial public violator of the Ten Commandments thought he would gain by creating and posting such an image.   J.D. Vance, a nominal Catholic, needs to be made to condemn the image.    If Trump thought doing this might encourage the College of Cardinals to elect a MAGA-style pope, it may just have the opposite effect.",clamorous_owle,2025-05-04T14:42:19,16
Please take it hugely seriously! Drop this guy! He’s heading straight to Hell! What kind of Catholic are you if you support him now? You’re going straight to hell along with him! Karma is coming and it’s stronger than any religion.,ketgray,2025-05-04T18:03:05,3

It's gotta be bad when even Cardinal Dolan is criticizing him!,Mysterious_Eye6989,2025-05-06T02:49:33,1
People are taking this way too seriously.  Trump is basically just an overgrown basement dwelling incel edge lord trying to troll the world.  Ignore this trivial crap and focus only on the real harm he is doing on his day job.,VanDenBroeck,2025-05-04T15:43:10,-6

This definitely needs to influence their decision as they elect a new pope. The Church sorely needs a leader who will stand up and condemn this behavior.,foreverkelsu,2025-05-04T18:19:40,6
Why would we want to hear condemnation from the pope slayer?,SandiegoJack,2025-05-05T14:03:39,1
I would tell the cardinals to vote for Wilton Gregory for pope. Nobody currently in the College of Cardinals would drive Trump bananas as a Chicago-born African American who [apologized to LGBTQ+ Catholics](https://outreach.faith/2025/01/cardinal-wilton-gregory-i-apologize-to-lgbtq-catholics/).,clamorous_owle,2025-05-04T21:53:06,6
Amplifying his idiocy in such a way as to hurt him with some members of a key bloc of voters is good politics.   We should never miss an opportunity to make sure that MAGA's self-owns get all the attention they deserve.,clamorous_owle,2025-05-04T16:00:29,6

"This is what really sucks. This 34 time felon is threatening to invade our allies, he is disappearing all types of people (including American citizens), he has shockwaved the world economy, has been destroying tens of thousands of jobs for talented federal employees, etc etc.  But that doesn’t get his people to tick. Things like THIS are what trigger them. Things that made him notorious for a decade, ie shitposting, and they have no problem when it mocks liberals. When it offends some Catholics, then all of a sudden they think differently about the man (usually for a whole 5 seconds then give him another pass).  Absolutely disgusting.",AdOne5089,2025-05-04T16:01:57,4
"I'm an innkeeper and a year or so ago I jokingly said to one of our guests, ""Some people think he's the 2nd coming of Christ.""  The woman I said it to replied, with total sincerity, ""He is.""",tinyE1138,2025-05-04T15:22:42,15
