Why do they keep asking this guy questions ?,MapleMonstera,2025-04-23T20:39:39,175
"Wait, wait, wait. I thought he was already ""literally Hitler""??? So he is becoming Hitler? Is he in the cocoon phase?",chances906,2025-04-23T20:36:11,172
"Hitler and Nazi have lost most of their meaning due to them being a dog whistle for the left. Just like racism, misogyny, and about 10 others.",dottedoctet,2025-04-23T21:01:41,108
So sounds like he's calling for more violence and domestic terrorism.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-23T21:11:07,64

"So Dems are torn between saying Trump is truly, officially, Hitler reincarnated ‚Ä¶ or holding up more ‚ÄúFalse‚Äù signs during the State of the Union. Many options, results may disappoint!",LS100,2025-04-23T21:20:04,21
I'm amazed that the only history Democrats are aware of is WW2. There are no other relevant figures in history that they even try to make comparison with,mlbernardo,2025-04-23T22:16:58,21
He is trying really hard to ensure the next thing he says is more inconsequential than the previous thing.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-23T22:10:50,7
Ever notice how much Carville looks like Hit\*er without a mustache???,DJSpawn1,2025-04-23T20:35:11,25
I wonder why he pops up like this. Is he running out of money in retirement? could we set up a go fund me for him if he promises to go away?,MET1,2025-04-24T01:37:29,3
">Longtime Democratic strategist¬†James Carville questioned on¬†Wednesday whether Americans should wait until President Donald Trump becomes ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù before taking action against his administration. >‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to quote the great Barney Fife: ‚ÄòNip it. Nip it in the bud,‚Äô‚Äù Carville said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I say. Nip it, nip it in the bud. Don‚Äôt wait.‚Äù  Action? Like Civil War? Are they openly talking about revolution against our elected president because they don't agree with his agenda? Maybe before they out their lives on the line they should just move like Rosie and Ellen did.  Man, these Dems are really pushing the agitation. They're just begging nut-jobs to pick up on their hints.",triggernaut,2025-04-23T20:29:46,7

The Hitler comparison is bloody wild to me. About the only similarities they have is that they both breathe and eat food.,TheThunderOfYourLife,2025-04-24T06:43:03,2
No respect for him after seeing the 'Our Brand is Crisis' documentary (not the Sandra Bullock film with the same name).,MET1,2025-04-24T01:38:34,19
Because democrats are brainwashed dipshits who need instruction on how to function.,MaglithOran,2025-04-23T23:24:27,38

"2016-2020 was Larval Hitler.    2020-2024 was Pupa Hitler.    2025 is when Hitler emerges from the Trump Chrysalis.  2026-2027 is when Trump-Hitler gains full adulthood and cements his dominion over the earth.  2028 is when Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris combine their true forms to summon Mothra and Godzilla to save ~~Tokyo~~ Mother Gaia Starship Earth from Trump-Hitler and ""Junior Donny"" Vance in an epic battle that is both climactic and cinematic. The temperature of the earth will be reduced by 1‚Å∞C (or one communist degree), saving us for all eternity and the billionaires get taxed or something.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-04-23T22:20:31,115

"That, and some popular TV shows and movies.  It's tiresome.",MET1,2025-04-24T01:39:48,5
They‚Äôve been calling for that more and more every day since the election results were made official. Every day the veil over their threats gets thinner and thinner. It is only a matter of time before someone on the left goes to far and things get ugly.,Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-04-24T06:50:49,2

"I never know what to think about him.   Sometimes he shows very good self awareness. And has even said things like ""calling him Hitler instead of focusing on the economy was stupid"".   Well then he says this.",Trussed_Up,2025-04-24T05:24:09,18
