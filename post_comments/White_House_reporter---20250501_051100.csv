"It has nothing to do with dementia and Joe.  It has to do with a media that is more concerned with curating a sociopolitical narrative than reporting information.  Five years ago it was ignoring basic science and selling out to COVID authoritarians with God complexes.  3 years ago it was, again, ignoring basic science and whipping people into a frenzy over the COVID unvaccinated simply exercising their bodily autonomy.  There was no reasonable consideration the jab would stop transmission by any metric.  A year ago it was telling us a President who wouldn't do interviews, was stumbling around, was talking to people who weren't there, was totally fine.  We could tell he wasn't fine.  Now its crying fascism every time Trump blinks.    Devils Advocate, Trump is as bad as they say.  Ok, who is going to believe the kid that keeps crying wolf?  No one trusts liars, and lies of omission are still lies.      I'm not concerned over the child who is sitting in the Principals office falling on the sword knowing the next 4 years are going to suck for them and acting repentant.  Sorry, I get the only way forward is acknowledging fault and moving forward.  Perhaps there isn't a path forward?  There is no doubt in my mind this is insincere and when the winds change in 3.5 years they will have learned nothing and whatever transient change happened for 4 years will be quickly put on the shelf in favor of more BS.  That is even assuming this can momentarily alter sentiment, which I don't think it will.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-01T09:25:08,3
It's too little too late. The damage to the country has been done. The media has a responsibility to correctly inform the public and they failed. Simple as that. The question that needs to be asked is *did they do so willingly?*,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T07:20:48,8
I appreciate this guy calling out the media and giving them the tough medicine.  But he’s taking a ‘told ya so’ approach when his contribution to the Biden Dementia story was his short temper and the staffers work to prevent him from tripping in public.  That’s a far cry from the mental infant we saw on debate night.  And that ignores the years of claims by the media that any serious mental decline was just cheap fake right wing Q anon lies.  The other quoted unnamed source who claims that the media had been covering the dementia with hundreds of stories can just fuck right off.,j3remy2007,2025-05-01T05:25:30,9
Most mainstream media is left wing propagandists.  Admitting they were airing left wing propaganda on Dementia Biden isn't going to make folks trust them more.,GiediOne,2025-05-01T06:45:47,3
