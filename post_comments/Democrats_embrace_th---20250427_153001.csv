"So controversial to use a common expletive. /s.  In 1992 Limbaugh called the thirteen-year-old child of someone, doesn’t really matter who, but happened to be the President, “the White House dog.”  Fuck you.  Despite your pretend normalcy you will always be people that thought that was acceptable discourse.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!!!  Yeah, listen to Rush laughing at people dying of aids.  And expect manners of speech from your relatives.  Fuck you!  Fuck you is actually really much more polite than things I could say.  It is a non-specific repudiation.  I don’t want to take the gloves off with my older family members that have listened to hate speech for the last thirty years.  They are in their eighties.  What is the point?  Except a private fuck you!  And it is so much kinder.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T15:43:47,4

"Great, you said fuck. Really proud of you. Now, how about embracing some actual fucking policy positions that help people instead of milquetoast bandaids that don’t hurt the fee fees of the ultra wealthy and corporations and that you instantly abandon the moment a Republican says no.",JahoclaveS,2025-04-27T20:04:15,3
"Just be real, don't hide behind a facade, don't force something you're not. That goes for the folks who aren't even doing that without the need to swear.   But fuck it, maybe that's just me.",nerphurp,2025-04-27T15:36:04,6
