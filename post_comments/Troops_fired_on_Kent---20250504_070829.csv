"Today is the 55th anniversary of the fatal shooting of 4 antiwar protesters and wounding of 9 others at Kent State University. Some protesters threw rocks at National Guardsmen, who responded with lethal force. I am concerned that the same scenario might be repeated before the nightmare Trump 2.0 is over.",Nerd-19958,2025-05-04T07:13:21,50

"Dear Reddit, this is your reminder that the boomers you blame everything on…This was them. Reddit loves to say they are living through the worst times in American history. Boomers lived through one president getting his head blown off, the next president escalating the Vietnam war and eventually deciding they didn’t want to run for president again, then the next president being Richard Nixon and Watergate and resigning. You had Kent State, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Watergate, Vietnam. But despite all of that going on, they still brought about the anti-war movement, the civil rights movement, and the free love movement. And yet Reddit bashes them for doing nothing and blames all their ills on the evil boomers.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T09:44:09,-10
"Ah yes, the protests where students (and non-student agitators) vandalized school property causing thousands of dollars in damage, broke the law, refused to disperse, waved terrorist flags, and intimidated, harassed, blockaded, and verbally and physically assaulted Jewish students, staff and faculty.

So a few corrections at least one of the four maybe two killed had nothing to do with the protest and was walking to class. However that being said the national guard did walk away from the protesters and were followed until they were cornered before firing. Also protesters burnt down the rotc building the night before leading to high tension,Alternativesoundwave,2025-05-05T03:29:41,2

"Of course it will; Trump is obsessed with arming local police departments with weapons of war. See summary of, and link to, recent Executive Order linked bellow.  Among other dangerous provisions, this EO calls for arming local police departments to ""increase the provision of excess military and national security assets in local jurisdictions to assist State and local law enforcement"", ""the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall determine how military and national security assets, training, non-lethal capabilities, and personnel can most effectively be utilized to prevent crime,"" ""prosecute  any public officials who interfere with law enforcement"" (e.g. judges advising illegal immigrants to book) OR carry out DEI initiatives, the AG shall ""provide legal resources and indemnification to law enforcement officers who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.  This mechanism shall include the use of private-sector pro bono assistance for such law enforcement officers."" - in other words those Big Law firms who caved into Trump's illegal and coercive demands are now coerced into providing Defense counsel to cops accused of excessive use of force.

"Before Kent State, there was the Orangeburg Massacare that happened on February 8, 1968 at the South Carolina State College in Orangeburg, SC. Black students were protesting when 28 were shot (mostly in the back) by state police. 3 were killed.  It was the first university killing of protestors by police officers in  American history.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg_Massacre",Nah_nevamind,2025-05-04T17:52:54,6
"Kent State was horrific, but nowhere near comparable to Tiananmen Square. Kent State had 4 people gunned down by the national guard, we don't even know how many people were killed at Tiananmen Square, with the official report saying 300, but estimates being in the thousands. The American government also acknowledges Kent State much more than the Chinese government acknowledges Tiananmen Square. Finally they were caused by different factors. Kent State was the result of some trigger happy guardsmen, they weren't acting under orders from the higher ups. They weren't told to go in an open fire on protesters. Meanwhile that's exactly what happened during Tiananmen Square, Chinese soldiers killing civilians on the orders of the Chinese government.",CombinationRough8699,2025-05-04T17:11:19,8
"The death toll estimate of T-square was at least 240 according to the Chinese government, and possibly up to 2600 according to the Red Cross.

"You sound deranged the national guard tried to get away from the protesters and were boxed in, being outnumbered and surrounded by a mob that had been violent the night before they felt the need to defend themselves. The reason someone who wasn’t near got killed was because the member of the guard shot above the crowd to scare not harm them. Afterwords there was a saying in Ohio “it was just one group of draft dodgers fighting another” since back then the national guard didn’t get called up with the army.",Alternativesoundwave,2025-05-05T16:17:36,1
"Wow! Nothing in your source points to Richard Nixon, then president of the United States ordering, deploying, or dispatching the Ohio National Guard to Kent State University.

"You focused-in on the Nixon part of those lyrics, and you are correct, he didn't send the national guard. The governor of Ohio did.  Now that we have that out of the way, this song _focuses_ on dead students that were shot by that national guard. (Funny your first impulse was to defend Nixon?) Further, if you actually read the link, you would have known Nixon _did_ have an impact at Kent State by invading Cambodia while giving the US public the false impression that the Vietnam war was winding down. That was the _whole point_ of those Kent State protests, at the time.  and it was explained in that link above. Characterizations as though Nixon had nothing to do with what happened at Kent State are disengenous.",oldteen,2025-05-05T20:50:39,2

You used a millennial quote 40+ years afterwards to try and downplay factual history and then made up a “rule” to further justify the collective victim complex of the largest and most politically powerful voting block in the nation.
