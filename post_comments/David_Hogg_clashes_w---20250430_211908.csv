"Carville said ""Win elections,"" but he didn't highlight how to do that. David Hogg is right. People want action not strongly worded letters.",Troubled202,2025-04-30T21:31:19,27

James Carville refuses to accept that you can't beat Reoublicans by being like them. His only success is Bill Clinton. He has backed losers every single goddamn time after.,papibigdaddy,2025-04-30T23:01:55,10
James Carville is a Fetterman-like. He needs to stfu and hide under a rock.,MeatPrestigious3597,2025-04-30T21:21:10,20
"""old man yells at cloud""  when fox is presenting carville as the voice of reason, it's way past time for msnbc to stop giving this clown a platform.",RepulsiveLoquat418,2025-04-30T21:30:40,10

Fox is propaganda and a distraction and tries to align politics with a sports team fanatic mentality. Good luck when elections have consequences and you need to drive another fifty or a hundred miles to get cancer screening or treatment after rural hospitals close due to budget cuts.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-30T21:50:50,6
Could do without the Fox.  It isn’t like the propaganda is hard to find.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-30T22:17:32,3

"> Carville said ""Win elections,"" but he didn't highlight how to do that.  I've been calling the establishment democrat the 92 crew, because all they know how to do is re run the 92 clinton campaign of being slight to the left of republicans.  the action dosen't need to be far left, but we need a lot of action; and that is what the establishment fears most.",roastbeeftacohat,2025-04-30T21:47:05,17
"I think the 2nd headline I saw right after the one announcing David hoggs intention to primary incumbents was [this one:](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a64504888/dnc-democratic-primaries-support-new-candidates/)  >I Hate to Say This but DNC Vice Chair David Hogg’s New Maneuver Is Ill-Advised—and Worse Timed  My dude, if not now, when? If the Dems won handily, i (nor anyone else) surely wouldn't be calling for it, but they didn't win. The old formula apparently isn't working. pelosi and Schumer, for all the power they wield, need to gtfo.   Getting sick of these silent gens refusing to retire, and either from arrogance, greed, or both; decide to ruin their legacy like rbg, feinstein, and Biden (who attempted to salvage it way too late).",O918,2025-04-30T23:05:32,9
>David Hogg is right. People want action not strongly worded letters.  David Hogg is completely unwilling to describe exactly what actions he wants to see other than 'primary incumbents'. Who should those incumbents be replaced with?   \*waves hands vaguely\*,PeliPal,2025-04-30T22:00:14,-7

"The Clinton machine still has a grip on power, thanks to the fundraising structures they created... and we've got to jettison that. Small dollar donors fired by honest passion beat wall street, and we might be facing the last chance for it.",withwhichwhat,2025-05-01T02:21:49,5

"People have no memory beyond themselves. Boomers became politically aware as a generation in the Regan revolution, and have internalized that ""low taxes, small government"" is an unbroken American tradition.",roastbeeftacohat,2025-05-01T07:43:05,2
"oh i'm aware. my mother's one of these people, despite being totally sympathetic to FDR as well. she even believes in taxing the rich massively etc., and would be thrilled at a new FDR-like figure attaining office. trying to discuss politics with her recently has taught me a lot about the nature of media: it's less about defining viewers' preferences per se, and more about creating a powerful perception of what the options are, and what is normal. change the framing and someone's own actual still-existing preferences will be ignored completely and dismissed as ""unrealistic"", or change it another way and you'll find thousands of people feeling devoted fervor for something they never previously saw as possible.",wavygrave,2025-05-02T10:19:44,1
