"I hope maple MAGA listens. We don't have write in ballots in our federal elections, someone writing trump on their ballot would have it dismissed as a spoiled ballot and put in with the pile of other spoiled ballots which we only keep track of to make sure all the ballots handed out are accounted for.",JadedLeafs,2025-04-28T12:29:36,10

"Well, that's certainly a headline. It implies both a nonexistent option /and/ an impossible outcome, but hey, it generates clicks!  Also: >Despite Trump‚Äôs suggestion, Canadians cannot vote for him since he is not on the ballot. There are 16 registered political parties in Canada -- with the Liberals and the Conservatives being the most dominant. Other parties include the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, the United Party and the Canadian Future Party.  RIP to the NDP and Bloc.",anemic_royaltea,2025-04-28T11:53:53,11

"Ooh, do they get more school shootings that way? (Statistically, yes)  Do they get less healthcare coverage? (Yes)  Would that improve Trump's sagging approval numbers? (No)  It's a tough call, but Canadians are less likely to give up their children's safety and their own health care coverage to join forces with a massive failure American president--one failing in ways people alive haven't ever seen before.",localistand,2025-04-28T12:02:51,3

"Canada is too big to become a single U.S. state. Its population is more than 1/10 of the U.S. population. Therefore, at least five U.S. states can be carved  out of Canada. Then the U.S. Republicans will lose power for some 40-50 years, as it happened before. Is Trump‚Äôs suggestion extremely stupid?",Positive_Owl_2024,2025-04-28T11:54:08,5

"You would think the literal president of the United States would realize that parliamentary systems don't involve people electing the prime minister directly, they vote for the majority party. There is no 'write in' provision like there is in the states.   I don't know all that much about parliamentary governments, but I do know like...the most basic facts about it. Like, it's genuinely terrifying to ponder the depths of this guy's stupidity as any head of state, let alone the US. He's repeatedly made it very clear that he has no idea how our own form of government works, let alone any other major governmental formats, so it's not exactly shocking.

"I get what you're saying but this is kind of a tiresome thing Americans keep repeating   1. 82-90% of Canadians (depending on the poll) have no interest at all in joining the US 2. Ergo, there's no way that Canada would willingly give up sovereignty to be a part of the US, not even if the US' tariffs worked and devastated Canada's economy 3. If the US annexed Canada, Canadians by and large wouldn't want to vote in the elections of the country that invaded them,¬†they'd be too busy violently resisting occupation 4.

"He doesn't even understand how his own government works. Trump lives in Trump Land, where he is Emperor and can have whatever he wants.  It is the same land where he wears adult diapers because of lifelong drug abuse, paints himself with bronzer and hair dye to hide his age, wears lifts in his shoes to look taller and a wear a red power tie that is too long because of a fashion that was popular 40 years ago.   A compulsive liar who has bankrupted his own casino and is unable to get a gaming license in Vegas because no one trusts him.  He is an idiot, a liar, a loser and now...he has dementia that gets worse everyday.

I'm convinced that part of the reason he does literally everything through EOs is that any other process is too complicated for him to execute. Being president is easy if all you do is sign papers other people prepare for you and spend the rest of the time golfing,Aoid3,2025-04-28T13:14:14,7
