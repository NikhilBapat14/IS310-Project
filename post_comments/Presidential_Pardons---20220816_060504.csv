"Yes. It has happened a few times before in US history. I believe Clinton reversed one of his own pardons after receiving more info about someone he pardoned. I know Andrew Johnson had some of his pardons reversed by Ulysses S. Grant - but that's suspect because the pardons issued were never received.   They can also be reversed if the president has been impeached (not removed, but impeached). That is to protect the rule of law and ensure a president cannot pardon their partners in crime to which they are a part of.  Remember a pardon is required if there is guilt. An admission of guilt or conviction is required for a pardon to be issued...(that's the one that gets me).",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T10:47:29,6
Only if the pardon hasn't been delivered.  Biden wouldn't be able to reverse pardons from Trump that have been delivered.,mojo4394,2022-08-16T12:49:25,1
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the pardon could only be revoked before the person had received it. I thought that, once delivered, the person was free and clear.",OrangeBlueKingfisher,2022-08-16T15:36:11,4
You are right. I had to go back and see what happened with Marc Rich. They wanted to rescind it and it was too late.,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T15:43:26,5
"Honestly, if it was up to me, I'd get rid of that. I can imagine so many situations where that is abused. It *should* be that a pardon is final and irreversible the second the ink hits the paper.",OrangeBlueKingfisher,2022-08-16T16:02:41,2
I would agree with that.,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T17:11:53,1
