"They will still be genuflecting to their king, Trump, though. Musk and his scout troop came in with bedazzled chain saws, created havoc and leave behind ruins that can't be repaired. His puppies will be scratching their finally sprouting stubble, wandering around aimlessly not knowing what to do. There will be no one to ask either because everyone's been fired. And Musk will go down in history as America's Rasputin.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T02:24:03,3

"Poor fella. I don't know why people are so mean to him. At the end of the day, his only crime was using his unlimited money to buy the United States government and then leveraging that power to dismantle it all to further enrich himself at your expense.       Oh, fuck, did I start this post by saying ""poor"" fella? I meant to say rich. Really rich. Richer than any other human being living or dead. In history. Silly me.",RyloKloon,2025-04-24T00:29:23,3
