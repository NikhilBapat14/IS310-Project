"Article snippet:  >‚Ä¶Trump is gearing up for a wave of White House firings that could come as soon as late next week in a plan that West Wing aides have branded ‚ÄúThe Purge,‚Äù Politico reported Thursday, citing an unnamed administration official.  >‚ÄúA lot‚Äù of terminations are on the table, a second official told Politico. The plan reportedly involves firing staff in a massive wave rather than doing it piecemeal, starting with mid-level White House staffers.  >Trump has so far restrained himself from replaying the chaotic turnover that plagued his first term, but Mike Waltz‚Äôs ouster as national security adviser and swift reassignment as United Nations ambassador may be a sign of a brewing storm.  >‚Ä¶  >Trump reportedly held off on firing Waltz despite the major blunder partly to avoid the appearance that he was reacting to negative media coverage.  >‚ÄúWaltz has been on thin ice for a while,‚Äù a White House ally told Politico at the time. ‚ÄúThis made the ice thinner but at the same time‚Ä¶ may actually save him for now because they don‚Äôt want to give Goldberg a scalp.‚Äù",progress18,2025-05-02T05:03:26,105
