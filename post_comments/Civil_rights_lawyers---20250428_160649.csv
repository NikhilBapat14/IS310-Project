The mission is shifting alright. Instead of defending civil rights they're going to be eliminating them.,Tyrannical-Botanical,2025-04-28T16:09:47,58
The ACLU and other groups are about to get a bunch of talent to sue the shit out of Trump and his dumpster fire of an administration.,Brokkyn2024,2025-04-28T16:15:28,28
">**The new head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division is dramatically reshaping the office to propel President Donald Trump’s social agenda,** prompting the departure of about half of the division’s lawyers in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the situation and public statements from top officials.  This is  beyond sickening. The civil  rights division of the justice department should be focused on protecting peoples civil rights, not forcing the presidents ""social agenda"" down the countrys throat.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-28T16:10:29,21
Are we stacking teams in the name of civil rights?  Trump has unified lawyers against his administration yet again.,thieh,2025-04-28T16:12:27,10

"The new head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division is dramatically reshaping the office to propel President Donald Trump’s social agenda, prompting the departure of about half of the division’s lawyers in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the situation and public statements from top officials.  Since being sworn in this month, civil rights director Harmeet K. Dhillon has redirected her staff to focus on combating antisemitism, anti-Christian bias, the participation of transgender athletes in women’s sports, and what Trump and his allies have described as Democrat’s “woke ideology.”  The division changed mission statements across its sections to focus less on racial discrimination and more on fighting diversity initiatives and anti-Christian bias. And department officials reassigned more than a dozen career staffers — including section chiefs overseeing police brutality, disability and voting rights cases — to areas outside of their legal expertise.

Good. They can do better work on the outside. Most of its going to be fighting the justice department and Trump I’m guessing.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-28T16:12:45,7

What's the mission? Is it lying under oath for an administration full of criminals conducting illegal activities against US citizens.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T16:48:18,1
