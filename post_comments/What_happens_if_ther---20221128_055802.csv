"The Speaker of the House is mentioned in both the Constitution and various federal statutes. Generally, if a speaker's not able to be elected the House will hold as many rounds of voting as it needs to until the Speaker is chosen. In extreme cases it can take literal weeks of voting to choose a speaker.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-11-28T19:43:54,17

One possibility is that the Dems could vote and elect a Republican Speaker.  They may see it as the lesser of two evils to vote for someone like McCarthy rather than someone on the fringe Right being elected.   Or they could watch the circular firing squads start.   Is this the closest one-party majority? I think it's 223-215(?),Skeptic135,2022-12-18T14:22:43,1

so no business gets done in the House until a speaker is elected or can other bills get brought to the floor and voted on while this is happening?,gerd50501,2022-11-29T04:48:45,1
"What is a majority? The 218? Or could it be Most Reps voting for McCarthy, except Crazy caucus, they vote for Orange boy, and leaves McCarthy with let's say with 205 votes, and all Dems vote for Schiff (throwing a name) and he gets , 210, is he elected Speaker?",IamBananaRod,2022-11-28T23:23:45,1
"First, I'd like to apologize for my late response. When I saw your comment in the morning I had to get into the office. That being said, it is theoretically possible for the House to operate without a Speaker. The election of the Speaker, along with the adoption of the rules of procedure is part of a larger process called the ""organization"" of the House.   The House, unlike the Senate, is not a continuous body. Every two years after the general election the entirety of its membership is renewed. This newly elected House is not bound by the rules of its predecessor. This large body of 435 Representatives needs to ""organize"" in order to transform itself from a crowd of hundreds into a deliberative assembly governed by parliamentary procedure.  This ""organization"" process is governed by tradition because, as I previously stated, the newly elected House doesn't have any rules or officers (including a Speaker). These traditions are not held in place by any law, and theoretically they could be changed. In general the organization takes the following steps:  1. The Clerk of the House from the preceding Congress takes the chair and calls the members-elect to order.  2. From the chair the Clerk has members-elect record their presence to determine that a constitutionally mandated quorum is present.  3. One-by-one the Clerk calls on members-elect to vote by surname for Speaker.  4. The Speaker-elect assumes the chair from the Clerk.  5. The Dean of the House, the longest serving member of the House, administers the oath of office to the Speaker.  6. The Speaker administers the oath of office to the members.  7. The House passes a resolution electing its officers including: the Clerk, the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chief Administrative Officer, and a Chaplain.  8. The House passes a resolution adopting its rules of procedure.  9. The House passes a resolution assigning members to the House's standing committees.  If the House convenes and there is no majority behind a single speaker candidate the whole process gets stuck at step 3. The House is left with no Speaker to preside, no officers to manage the House's thousands of employees, no rules to govern its proceedings, and no committees to do its work.  It is possible that the unorganized members might try to change these traditions. I was able to find one example from 1849 when the House deviated from the traditional organization process. In that year after the House failed to elect a Speaker after 59 rounds of voting the following resolution was adopted as a compromise:  >Resolved, That the House will proceed immediately to the election of a Speaker, viva voce; and if, after the roll shall have been called three times, no Member shall have received a majority of the whole number of votes, the roll shall again be called, and the Member who shall then receive the largest number of votes, provided it be a majority of a quorum, shall be declared to be chosen Speaker.  With this special rule in place the House was finally able to elect Congressman Howell Cobb with 102 votes out of 222, or about 45.9% of the total votes, on its 63rd round of voting.  So, it is possible that a resolution could be adopted that would allow the House to operate without a Speaker. However, if history is any guide it's extremely unlikely.   Sorry if this response is a little long-winded.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-11-29T21:04:01,2
