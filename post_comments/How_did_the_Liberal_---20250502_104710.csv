"This does not answer your question.  Others have done that already.  But I want to point out that there is no truth in the ""everything will get better if we get rid of immigrants"" line of nonsense.  It's just demagoguery and fear mongering.  Trump used it to get into power because it works on the weak minded.  ""Daddy is going to make all the bad people go away.  Then everything will be better.""  Hitler used the same argument, and it worked then too, but it has never proven true.    Canada should be proud of itself.  It has demonstrated itself as being smarter than the USA.",brothersand,2025-05-02T16:35:35,51

Polls show more people support amnesty for undocumented immigrants than mass deportations. And now with Trump threatening Canada it seems unlikely a conservative would win an election there.,MrChow1917,2025-05-02T16:26:36,29
For the same reason that just being on reddit would have made you think Kamala Harris would have won in a landslide. Online communities aren’t representative of real life people.,tlopez14,2025-05-02T16:28:37,25
"You're listening to rhetoric that gets clicks and likes. When people spout this stuff and get clicks and likes they spout more of that rhetoric. If they say something that doesn't get clicks and likes they say less of that and more of the other. This is how Trump went from left wing to right wing. This is how Polievre went from a super nerdy MP no one had ever heard of to mini Trump.  I don't think immigrants are the problem, and a lot of people I know don't. But we're not on these social channels spouting our opinions.",kwalitykontrol1,2025-05-02T16:30:40,5
Because there’s a huge amount of disproportionately right-wing trolls on social media that try desperately to project this image of a right-wing opinion among a “silent majority”… the reason they have to hide behind this “silent majority” idea is precisely because this supposed majority never actually materializes in reality.,AmusingMusing7,2025-05-02T16:42:38,5
"My guess would be they saw what was happening in the US and had to double take.   Politicians always go too far with everything, this leads to them being replaced only for the next person to go the opposite way and further than what the people want.  It's like a coin flip, it never lands in the middle",Comfortable-Can4776,2025-05-02T16:26:48,4
The Liberal Party backtracked on most of its immigration policies and significantly tightened them up. There is basically no real difference on immigration policy between the Liberals and the Conservatives now.,Knight_Machiavelli,2025-05-02T16:42:25,2
"All of the reasons you said are true, but another big thing is that there isn't *that* much daylight between Canadian parties on immigration. The Liberal Party walked back some of their most egregious policies and committed to negative population growth for a couple of years, while the Conservative leader has been pretty vague about ""lower"" targets and hasn't campaigned heavily on this point.  Contributing to this reality is that high immigration has a lot of advantages for a prime minister trying to steer Canada's economy, so it's hard for someone serious about the job to throw that advantage away. Might make it easier for you to get the job to campaign on major cuts to immigration, but you might have screwed your future self when you have to walk that back or go through with it.",TheFrixin,2025-05-02T16:35:45,3
When it comes to the far right peoples party most people I’ve talked to say eh good immigration policy but they think the rest of their policies are extremist,penis-muncher785,2025-05-02T16:37:37,1
"The election was largely about Trump.  That increased turnout and votes for the Liberals.  Carney ran away somewhat from Trudeau's record, which allowed him to move the Liberals a bit to the right on immigration.  That took some of the wind out of the Conservatives' sails.  Immigration was not high on a list of voter priorities.  One can presume that many of those who were fired up about it were going to vote Conservative, regardless.  The Conservatives actually won a higher share of the vote than they have for some time.  The issue probably did resonate for some.  Trump's drama turned this into mostly a two-horse race, with some Bloc and NDP voters defecting because avoiding a Tory win due to Trump became a top priority.  In Canada, the winner of the plurality becomes PM, so this was a logical decision for voters who held that viewpoint to make.",I405CA,2025-05-02T16:54:46,1
"Maybe on Reddit it's the certain subreddits you're visiting which found a more conservative audience.  On Twitter, it's completely understandable why there would be a significant conservative userbase there.  With Youtube, well, I don't know.  EVERYONE and their grandma uses Youtube.  You could probably find a lot of people commenting with conservative sentiments.",RamJamR,2025-05-02T17:11:04,1
"Have you seen the polling? A majority are more against arrests, detention and deportation without due process than they are against Trump's shiteous tariffs",PreviousAvocado9967,2025-05-02T17:31:30,1
"I think Canada's immigration problem and rhetoric is fundamentally different from America's immigration issue. In the US, the solution would be to expand the visa numbers while raising standards so that more immigrants have viable paths for residency, and not resort to illegal entries. This would be a net benefit to our economy since immigrants could move up the economic latter legally.  Canada's immigration issue is entirely due to mismanagement than being obsolete like in the US. Immigration was prioritized over social services. This led to an over extension of public programs and housing shortage that couldn't accommodate the massive inflow of new people. Canada is still a big believer of the ""century initiative"", where they want to have 100 million people by the end of the century to stay relevant on the geopolitical stage. That reality as well as Canada's nationalism being tied to liberalism, makes the criticism about immigration more wrapped around ""we didn't prepare well enough"" rather than ""getting rid of them will fix everything.""",illegalmorality,2025-05-02T17:58:28,1
"As it seems to me, from what you have said you yourself either are anti-immigration or the algorithm in your social media thinks that you are. And what happens is that for example twitter shows you content relevant to your position (the position the algorithm thinks you have), which makes you think that that everyone and everywhere is ant migration which is not the case. You fell victims to social media algorithms.",ProfessionOk3149,2025-05-05T13:37:19,1
"Mainly because it’s not anti-immigration. Since everyone, even the vocal detractors, knows that they are descended from immigrants.  It’s anti-exploitation of the Temporary Foreign Workers program to do work that allegedly Canadians won’t do. When in reality Canadians would do those jobs, but they do not get hired because corporations want cheap labour.  The problem is that campaigning to change capitalism does not get clicks and attention that there is a problem. Especially when a number of MPs are profiting off of it as landlords. Unfortunately, unfairly treating immigrants as scapegoats does get clicks and attention. That what compels some sort of effort to change the system as it is currently set up. Yes, it’s Trumpy, but it works.  Poilievre had no serious plan to deal with immigration answer, or anything that it’s being blamed for (housing, inflation, job completion, healthcare overload, etc). He was more focused on two non-existence factors (Trudeau and the consumer carbon tax) and defunding the CBC.  Not really a surprise that he blew the massive lead he did. Frankly he should have stepped down after that, but that’s not what he’s doing.  If the anti-immigration sentiment in Canada was serious, the PPC would be doing better in the polls. Instead, they are irrelevant, having lost three straight elections and wining a single seat. That party only exists to hurt the Conservatives.  The Liberals are also aided in that the Democrats lost in 2024, and that as a party, the Liberals did not select Chrystia Freeland to be their leader. If the opposite of either of those scenarios happened, the Conservatives would have won, and the NDP would have done much better and might have even formed Official Opposition again.",DJ_HazyPond292,2025-05-07T10:59:43,1
"All countries face multiple challenges. Most voters see the elections as referendums on multiple issues, not just one. It seems the people of Canada consider immigration to be less of a problem than Dumold Trump. They overwhelmingly supported the candidate who stood up to the Orange Diktator, not the one who submitted to him.",honuworld,2025-05-02T16:30:34,1
"Because the far right is very well bankrolled and racists are incredibly loud.   That's not to say that immigration is always good. The TFW program, while not explicitly 'immigration', is a mechanism by which companies can enjoy significantly lower labor costs at the expense of Canadian born workers. I'd like to see the carney government address it, but both the Liberals and conservatives know how their bread is buttered so i wouldn't bet on any significant structural changes to it. We never bothered to build housing and infrastructure capacity for massive influx of people (again at the behest of markets, and boomers will fucking riot if house value goes down).  We've dug ourselves into a hole and it's much easier to whip racists into a frenzy to get their vote than actually navigate policy. Also you have to understand that people are stupid in general and tune out when you get into protracted policy discussions, particularly if they don't know what's going on.",Champagne_of_piss,2025-05-02T17:25:10,1

"I think what’s online is a bad rubric for the general population - is distorted by right wing algorithms and is really over representative of a loud minority of bigots motivated to make disparaging comments about immigration/immigrants.  Most Canadians are open to immigration, and really our immigrant populations and multicultural communities are exactly what makes our cities awesome.   And truthfully- in any post colonial western culture, save for First Nations peoples, we’re all immigrants.",pomod,2025-05-02T16:58:57,0

"Most people aren't terminally online, to add onto why online sentiment doesn't translate to reality.  Furthermore, trump proved that anti immigrant positions like his aren't a magic bullet to fix the economy.  The solutions to our woes are not to remove people who are so desperate that they will take back breaking work for minimum wage.  And everyone knows this but some people believe that the people doing that work should be the citizens that they do not like.",TheTresStateArea,2025-05-02T17:19:41,6
Americans lose 44k jobs for every 500k deportations. The labor force relies heavily on undocumented labor. You can't just pull out one of the spokes on the cog and think you're going to sustain the same level of consumer demand and productivity. The economy always rises with more migrant workers and shrinks when they're prevented from working.,PreviousAvocado9967,2025-05-02T17:33:25,4
"This is it.  OP says this is the prevailing opinion everywhere online, but what exactly does that mean?  Facebook, YouTube, X, and  most other social media apps are algorithm based.  If OP watched a video or 2 or interacted with a posting on any of those sites, their algorithm is going to start serving up posts and media with a similar viewpoint.  It can quickly seem like ""everyone is saying the same thing"" because the algorithms go out of their way NOT to show you any material with a different viewpoint.  It's one of the more insidious aspects of social media.  It quickly creates an echo chamber for you where all you hear and see are opinions that reinforce what you already think.  At that point, you have to actually make a concerted effort to seek out differing opinions. Otherwise, you'll never see/hear them.",Roadside_Prophet,2025-05-02T16:39:22,6

"That's actually kind of the opposite of what happened. Public opinion turned against the government's immigration policies, so the government moderated them.

"> The economy always rises with more migrant workers and shrinks when they're prevented from working.  I suspect you've got causality backwards.
