">""We believe the court has overstepped and lacks jurisdiction there, and I will not tell law enforcement to stop fulfilling their constitutional duties,” Uthmeier said.""  Excuse me officer, but I believe you're overstepping and lacking jurisdiction in pulling me over cause I'm declaring this stop unconstitutional and I'm just expressing my constitutional freedom of doing whatever the fuck I want regardless of the laws. I guess I'll just be on my way now.   What an absolute fucking clown show of an AG. If he, or anyone else has an issue with the ruling, take it back to court and fight it.

"I wish I knew why the judiciary is refusing to exercise their powers and hold them in contempt.  Personally, I believe it to be a mixed bag of fear.  The consequences of holding some of these people in contempt could literally be a civil war.  It could be simply cracking the illusion that these people are irreproachable.  It could also be the recent Supreme Court decision that granted immunity to the Office of the President, implying that anybody elected to the office is irreproachable.  It could be a myriad of different things or any combination thereof.  May main concern is that we need to have a criminal contempt in order to actually enforce 18 USC 242 against these people, and nobody wants to see what happens when the president has to enforce a law against themself. Donald Trump managed to get away with treason, or whatever you want to call it, and still be elected president, there's no telling what he'll do, what he'll ask for when having to face the consequences of his actions, but it won't be pretty.",BananasAndAHammer,2025-05-04T16:05:52,14

"> The consequences of holding some of these people in contempt could literally be a civil war.  This is the correct answer.  Despite all the MAGA Snowflake tears, the courts are being *extremely* careful with their actions, for exactly the above reason.",Mindless-Pogram,2025-05-04T16:08:47,11
"> I wish I knew why the judiciary is refusing to exercise their powers and hold them in contempt.  Because contempt isn't just a one and done situation, you have to cite specific people in contempt, and that charge can then be challenged, which means it has to be rock solid as to who and what they did.  The judge has already asked for a list of people and what roles they played in Garcia's ending up in El Salvador, that's a required step before issuing contempt orders.",atreeismissing,2025-05-04T22:30:51,4
">I wish I knew why the judiciary is refusing to exercise their powers and hold them in contempt...The consequences of holding some of these people in contempt could literally be a civil war.  This is exactly it. And they don't fear it. They are already putting the pieces in place for a police state.* It has been the plan from the beginning to dispose of the judicial and legislative branches and make the executive the only game in town. Ignoring the court orders is the key play. They are gambling the courts will back down rather than throw the country into a civil war. That happens, it's game over. There is no law, but Trump's law. They will hand him the crown, and install a throne in the Oval Office, after Trump has had it gilded, where King Trump will hold court. The 250 year experiment will be over.  They have rather speed driven this through. Too much, too soon. It might be their undoing.  *Read this redditors comment about the recent EO:  https://old.reddit.com/r/law/comments/1kdkg0p/im_begging_you_read_the_april_28th_executive/  Excerpt:  >Why for the love of god is no one reading these executive orders?  >They are having the military work with local/ state law enforcement  >They are saying that they will arrest officials  >They are saying that state law will not shield anyone  >They are saying that they will use agents already placed in states >and even military personnel  >They are saying that the standard they intend to use is as low as >""harboring"" immigrants, or even having DEI policies (for which >they mention they will go after colleges)  >They are saying that they will use RICO against everyone  >They are calling current policies insurrection by name and ""an >intolerable national security risk""  >They are saying they want to build more prisons  Edit: word.",inthekeyofc,2025-05-04T18:15:41,1
