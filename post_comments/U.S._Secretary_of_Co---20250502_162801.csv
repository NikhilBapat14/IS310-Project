"Nobody wants to work in a factory. They keep hearkening back to the ‘50s as this grand American period because things were manufactured in America.   What they don’t tell you is the reason why factory work was somewhat attractive for the time is because dad could go to work while mom stayed home with the 2-3 kids while being able to afford a house, food, vacations, and everything a middle class family wants.   You aren’t getting paid that type of wage for factory work in the US in 2025. You never will be getting paid that for factory work in the US.

"He does realize... oh hell... probably not.  * Automation - While the plan relies on technicians to maintain robots, advancing AI and self-repairing machinery could eventually eliminate even these roles. Betting on perpetual human labor in automated systems is technologically naive. * Protectionism - High tariffs and immigration curbs may temporarily boost domestic manufacturing but risk long-term inefficiency, inflated consumer costs, and retaliation from trade partners. Isolationist policies historically struggle to sustain growth in a globalized economy. * Labor Shortages - Aggressive deportation policies exacerbate existing labor gaps, contradicting the need for factory workers. Meanwhile, aging populations and low birth rates complicate intergenerational workforce continuity. * Overstated Wage Promises - While $70k-$90k salaries are touted, such wages depend on persistent labor scarcity. Automation and corporate cost-cutting could depress earnings over time, replicating the decline seen in other ""stable"" industries. * Skills Gap - Framing these jobs as requiring ""just a high school diploma"" understates the technical expertise needed for advanced manufacturing. Community college programs may not scale adequately or keep pace with evolving tech demands. * Nostalgia - The vision romanticizes post-WWII industrialism, ignoring modern workers' demands for upward mobility, creativity, and non-monetary benefits. Lifetime factory roles conflict with younger generations' job-hopping norms and gig economy influences.  This is tripe from someone who's head is probably full of the stuff.

For better or for worse, these plants contract staffing agencies who send them temp workers and a lot of them can’t get employment through normal means (citizenship, criminal records, etc). I have nothing to do with hiring so I dont know the exact process but I believe background checks only happen if they’re converted to a full time employee.

Starting pay in a couple states over was around $20+.

"This makes me think of when Mao decided to make everyone factory workers. But instead of going from mostly agricultural to industrial, it’s mostly service/healthcare/tech/education to industrial.  Here’s a summary of how that worked out:  “The Great Leap Forward was an economic and social campaign within China from 1958 to 1962, led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Party Chairman Mao Zedong launched the campaign to transform the country from an agrarian society into an industrialized society through the formation of people's communes.   The Great Leap Forward is estimated to have led to between 15 and 55 million deaths in mainland China during the 1959–1961 Great Chinese Famine it caused, making it the largest or second-largest famine in human history.”  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward",cyanescens_burn,2025-05-02T21:08:08,1
"How about no? Even if they did have safe conditions and good benefits and whatnot, the idea that we’ll transform from a highly advanced services-based economy, a world leader in research, technology, creative output, etc. into a low level manufacturing hub filled with nothing but laborers is antithetical to all of the values that the right claims to care deeply about.   There’s this idiotic obsession with manufacturing that Trump and his fans have, but it’s an emotion driven fantasy that caters only to the sliver of voters who are still mad about their local textile mill closing down in 1975. There’s nothing special or inherently good about manufacturing work. Sure, there’s an argument to be made for *strategic* investment in manufacturing - certain goods that are valuable for national security, advanced tech, etc., but this blanket obsession with any and all manufacturing is just delusional. We could have the same jobs we have now, with better benefits, fair pay, etc. with the same basic regulations seen in almost every other advanced economy, but instead there’s this absurd attachment to manufacturing as though the only way anybody can ever have a pension is by stamping sheet metal for 40 years.",james_d_rustles,2025-05-02T21:40:44,1

">I don’t get why these “red blooded American patriots” want to return to an industrial manufacturing economy when we have already have an advanced economy.   Well, at some point you need a basis for your economy, and industrialisation is a good one - you produce goods and either sell them overseas, or the surplus makes them cheaper in your own country. This is the rationale that makes cars cheap for Americans, and so on.   On the other hand, factory jobs usually pay well, have low educational requirements and  contribute well to communities.   What's the alternative?   >It’s taking a step back.   It really isn't.   The output of a national has no step back or forward, it's like if you had an initiative to get 10% of the population back to farming. Is that a bad thing?   Well, if it's high tech sustainable farming, not at all.   >America has set itself up to manage other countries’ labor while they do all the hard work.  Indeed, but that also puts you at the disadvantage of international whims. And of course, you do need some basis for your trade.  America has that, by the way, not saying this is a bas thing.   >I genuinely don’t get what people are seeing when they look back at these factory jobs that “made men men” by being exhausting, and providing little benefits  As with most golden ages, it's nostalgia and idealism leading to a bias. It's old man thinking ""gods I was strong then"" while looking at their soft shitty body, and not seeing the bright future they have.

There are some very valid criticisms of our higher education system:  * The push to get more college graduates has lead to rampant grade inflation and devaluing of college degrees.  * Institutions of higher learning are largely indifferent as to whether a student's degree choice is going to lead to them being employable. In other countries there's a duty for schools to help their students find employment. * Schools are charging predatory amounts of money for tuition while asking students to rely on loans and scholarships.   Anger and frustration about schools not living up to the standards they should be held to is absolutely valid in my opinion.
