">In the targeting of academic institutions, nonprofits, and law firms, the administration has been just as open about the fact that it will bring the weight of the federal government down to bear on those that are advancing oppositional or even just disfavored political agendas. It doesn’t take much imagination to tease out what form this obsession with regulating acceptable speech and political organizing could take if the Trump team could, with a few keystrokes, pull up a person’s health records, tax records, business associations, registrations, and so on.  My personal Red Line for staying in this country is the establishment of some sort of a social credit score.  I think my wife still doesn't believe it's possible but shit like this says to me they would very much like to do this in one form another.",campelm,2025-05-09T06:38:59,18

Do you not think palantir and other companies like them already have something like this on their side?,even_less_resistance,2025-05-09T07:08:11,6
"Assuming there is an opportunity to elect another non-MAGAloid POTUS. If there is, they need to completely erase every order and law he’s greenlit. Our treatment of MAGA needs to be made equivalent to how Germany treats Nazism. No tolerance or unity with scumbags that want us dead.",Spastik2D,2025-05-09T11:26:06,3

But what if we imagined a world where it wasn’t like this? Something radically different? Just as a thought experiment. I don’t think we are stuck unless we collectively believe we are,even_less_resistance,2025-05-09T08:33:44,1
