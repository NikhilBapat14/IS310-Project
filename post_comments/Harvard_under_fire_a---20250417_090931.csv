Harvard has a large enough endowment to not charge tuition for the next 100 years. Why is the government giving them any money at all? Should have been cut a long time ago and don’t blabber about research they have plenty to self fund.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-17T10:27:33,31

"Agreed. Universities as a whole shouldn't get a flat dime of federal money. States alone fund their own universities, and private universities, especially those with massive endowments like Ivy league schools, should get no gov help period. They should be 100% reliant on their own revenue streams and endowments and nothing else at all. Including for research grants and programs.",ITrCool,2025-04-17T10:43:13,11
