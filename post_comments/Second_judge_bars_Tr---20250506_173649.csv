I like how he clearly states what an invasion actually is.  He didn't mince words he made it pretty clear this isn't a law that can be used the way Trump tries to use it and isnt accepting bat shit crazy interpretations of what an invasion is.,coatofforearm,2025-05-06T17:43:28,40

This is just proof that the Supreme Court completely failed in their duty when the other AEA case was before them to begin with. Why in the fuck did they not find the exact same conclusion that Trump invoke the act unlawfully to begin with??????,StrDstChsr34,2025-05-06T18:19:08,10
I am sure Trump will have these judges arrested like the last two.,Trump_sucks_d,2025-05-06T20:47:26,3
Ok so who’s stopping the administration from doing it?,voodoo_zero,2025-05-07T10:21:55,1
So that's two District level judges... The middle school hall monitors of our legal system now. They can only suggest at this point. The judges understand 1930's Germany as well as the rest of us.,williamgman,2025-05-06T18:35:13,0
Very similar to what the TX judge included in his ruling.,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-06T17:46:16,13
Because that wasn’t what was technically asked of them.  They were asked a jurisdiction question and they answers that.  A case challenging the legality of the AEA hasn’t reached them.  It will!,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-06T18:22:09,9
