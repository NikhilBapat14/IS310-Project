"Trump is a senile, sociopathic imbecile.  The collapse of everything under this arrogant buffoon is, of course, to be expected   It gets much, much worse after this horrific start.  Hopefully, the brunt of it is borne by the red state rubes that voted this garbage into the White House.     The agonies of Biblical Job, are the least of what Trump voters have coming for their unforgivable sins against the republic.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-29T14:24:16,19

"Remember, Trump IS Bidens legacy.",18212182,2025-04-29T14:14:02,-17
Yep and not even in the way p2025 wants.,FlyingRock,2025-04-29T14:28:58,9
"In what way? The stock market has almost entirely recovered since the tariffs were announced a few weeks ago. It hasn’t been a full month yet, so we haven’t even gotten the 1st monthly jobs/economic reports.  Where are you seeing that the economy is crashing?",equitygainsonly,2025-04-29T20:38:36,-9

"What? That’s not how this work. Homie came in like wrecking ball, passing new laws and removing Biden’s legacy. The one thing I will give you credit for is trumps shitty tax code. I’ll give you that. Otherwise, this is exactly what you voted for.   Biden left with one of the strongest stock markets man. I’m sorry you’re in denial.",badscribblez,2025-04-29T14:37:01,13
I stubbed my toe. Is that Bidens fault too?,yotengodormir,2025-04-29T16:41:10,6

"The entire Democratic Party is at fault for what happened. It was a disaster and if he didn’t plan to run, he should’ve said something way sooner. I get what you’re saying no, I’m sorry for my answer, but still wouldn’t say that.",badscribblez,2025-04-29T14:49:04,0
"No. Biden was directly responsible. He appointed GOP faithful Marrick Garland as a “reach across the aisle” gesture, and Garland promptly tied his own hands on prosecuting Trump for his crimes.",zernoc56,2025-04-29T18:43:43,-2
"> … Garland promptly tied his own hands on prosecuting Trump for his crimes.  Are you talking about the part where Garland recused himself from prosecuting his own boss’s political opponent and instead appointed Jack Smith, who prosecuted Trump in two federal cases?",BudWisenheimer,2025-04-29T19:28:14,1
