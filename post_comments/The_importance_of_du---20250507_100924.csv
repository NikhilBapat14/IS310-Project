"I’ve been saying this for a while, if they somehow allow an American citizen to be deported without due process and can jail judges who actually uphold the constitution then what good is being a citizen? Our rights are just a worthless piece of paper if they can deport you to some war zone for any reason they see fit",amievenrelevant,2025-05-07T11:01:34,94
"This is why I got the REAL ""Star"" ID. According to the feds I now have proof of citizenship in my wallet.   I may not ever fly, but they have also said we'll need it to get in federal buildings and courthouses, military bases and VA facilities, and you hear Idiot Trump telling us we'll need proof of citizenship to vote.  America is reversing our concept of law. We now need proof of innocence before we ever commit any kind of crime.",YallerDawg,2025-05-07T14:18:12,24
It's not right even if you are straight up illegally in the country. But If even a single citizen slips through the cracks the process needs to be completely scrapped and reworked from ground up.  No variable.   No plan b.   No exceptions.  I'm only saying that because I actually am an American. As opposed to being any member of this new administration. Who are not Americans by any definition of the word.,Higher-Ed,2025-05-07T15:24:21,12

All you need to do to prove that you're an American citizen is hope that ICE doesn't lie about you telling them that you crossed the border into the country from Mexico. Just don't do ICE agents saying that you lied to them.,wonkalicious808,2025-05-07T21:03:47,2

Will dems quietly keep this as an option if they get power back? We best tell our electeds they can do the right thing without kicking and screaming every once in while.,uncleputts,2025-05-07T11:42:57,-9

"Exactly. It's not a big leap from ""the mom said they wanted to bring the kid along"" to ""we picked up this citizen by accident, but he said to just get him out of the country, anyway."" They've already set the precedent that it's not possible for them to get people back, even when the Supreme Court tells them to. Once you're gone, you're gone, even if it's a ""mistake.""",phriot,2025-05-07T13:03:02,28
