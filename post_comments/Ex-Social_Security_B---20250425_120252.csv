"The former Social Security Commissioner doubled down on his warning that beneficiaries could stop receiving payments due to the destruction wrought by Elon Musk’s DOGE. “I’ve never hoped I was wrong so much in my life,” he said.  In March, Martin O’Malley—who served as the agency’s commissioner under President Biden—predicted interruptions to Social Security payments “within the next 30 to 90 days.”  And earlier this month, he sounded the alarm again, stating that “the Trump co-presidency is gutting this agency.”  [**Read the full story**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-social-security-boss-sounds-alarm-doge-will-delay-checks/).",thedailybeast,2025-04-25T12:03:10,52
"My mother is a far right Trump voter who is trying to retire this year / collect social security. I keep warning her and she just blows me off and says it’s a lie. I wish I could say I get satisfaction from being correct but I actually hate it when our country fucks over its citizens. But unfortunately, it needs to be done so they can learn a lesson once and for all. You have to get burned so you never touch a hot stove again.",ChipNo6561,2025-04-25T12:09:29,95

"My local VA has already reduced services and lost nurses, including cuts to VA suicide prevention, and services to patients unable to travel to that clinic. No more house calls.   Oh, plus they have been ordered to cease all LGBTQ care and not even utter the word gender.

My phone appointment for survivor benefits that I scheduled over two months ago mysteriously didn’t happen despite a call from them the day before confirming it. I called SSA and was told me that they called three times with no answer. They lie as much as trump.,Msmdpa,2025-04-25T14:46:54,12

"I’m a bit worried about this guy’s warnings. It feels like everyone warning Twitter would collapse shortly after the Musk takeover. If the real civil servants left at SSA do the impossible and keep the system afloat, this guy is gonna look foolish and it will feed into a lot of misinformation about what DOGE is really doing. It's better to raise the alarm once, prominently, and then wait to see if shit actually goes down, instead of trying to raise the alarm over and over again.",thehightype,2025-04-25T13:24:12,9

"Tried to tell my recently early retired father/MAGAt and he took it so personally. As if I had flat out called him something disrespectful. Started screaming at me about how I’m wrong. It was a truly wild escalation on his part.   Which showed  me, these people are so far in their delusion that any thought outside of what Fox News has preached and shaped into his world view, if there’s something outside of that it shatters the worldview so completely that they literally can’t function.",brixowl,2025-04-25T15:18:33,17

"It’s good that you’re asking this question in general, but I think it’s also important to acknowledge the impossibility of proof in situations like these.  What kind of tangible proof could anyone possibly have for this sort of thing?  Other than his knowledge and understanding of the system, combined with the obvious gutting of SSA employees, along with the rest of government, I’d say there’s a strong non zero chance this dude may not just be “fear mongering”",MostMediumSuspected,2025-04-25T13:30:40,4
"Except, I fear, these particular fools are so deep in their echo chambers that not even third-degree burns across their entire body will make them learn because they don't *want* to recognize that they were wrong. I expect that they will double down for the cult of Dear Leader, yet again, until they literally die. They did this during COVID, and they'll do it again now.  I honestly do not expect a eureka moment from these people. They're too far gone. They're in too deep and they have wrapped so much of themselves up in a cult of personality that to lose it all would be more painful than literally losing their homes, their livelihoods, and maybe even their lives. They will double down until they're in the grave, and they will thank Dear Leader with their last breaths.  I want to be wrong. I really do. I want there to be a mass ""oh shit"" moment where they finally realize how badly they've been played. But I don't think we'll ever get there, simply because the cult doesn't want to recognize that they were played as fools. It's easier to simply ignore the reality and double down.",Gonkar,2025-04-25T15:23:14,24

"Yeah a widespread failure of social security would result in an economic domino effect.  Just one of which would be that most renters on social security are suddenly struggling to pay rent.  These people make up significant chunks of complexes and communities across the country.  You would quickly run into the same issues we’ve seen before ~5 years ago during Covid, where landlords would see such sudden and widespread failures to pay rent that it could actually become problematic to evict them all at once as if it were business as normal.",Kindness_of_cats,2025-04-25T20:22:17,7
