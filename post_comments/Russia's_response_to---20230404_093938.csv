"> arguing that enlargement of the pact is tantamount to an attack, etc.  Well, that's because they didn't actually believe this.

"The Russian President is either crazy or incredibly intelligent. If he is intelligent, then he knows that Europe doesn't pose a military threat unless threatened. That would also mean everything he has done (rhetoric wise) was just for show for the Russian people.
