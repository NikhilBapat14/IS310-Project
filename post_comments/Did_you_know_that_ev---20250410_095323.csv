Good news is that now there are calls for impeachment and concerns about insider trading within the finance space. And they have all been so pro Trump for the most part up until now. ,Inspirationseekr,2025-04-11T05:39:50,2
"Is there any proof the Frump bought extra stocks just before announcing Pause?  Isn't the president required to hand off all investments when taking office?  In other words, give more information about the $415 million.  It seems like a biased accusation, not evidence.  Edit: This is just the Trump Media 'DJT' stock recovering with all the other stocks in the market.  He did not 'pocket' $415 million.  This is just fake, biased bullshit.  And we Democrats are better than that.  Disclaimer:  I believe Frump is guilty of market manipulation and many of those that invested hours before the pause are guilty of insider trading, but it does not appear that Frump was among those investors.  If he is, then he is guilty as well.  Time for another Select Committee hearing.",parallelmeme,2025-04-10T10:10:05,5
