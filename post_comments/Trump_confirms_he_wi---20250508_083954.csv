Please please please tell me the deal is called the USUK Trade Agreement  PLEASE,ElPlywood,2025-05-08T08:47:30,45
Ok...what's the deal lol   Apparently we had a trade surplus with them before all this and no excessive tariffs from their side? Certainly not blanket like we did   It also took almost 40 days for one deal with an ally that should have been a fast¬†easy win? Doesn't bode well for China negotiations,blues111,2025-05-08T08:45:17,24
