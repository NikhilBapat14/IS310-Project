"I went to Job Corps in the late 90's and it completely changed the trajectory of my life.  I was homeless going in, and as of 2024, I made just over $100k.  Sad to see that it has become a bloated bureaucracy.  When I was in the program, Job Corps spent less than 20k per student, and that was the total cost of providing education, training, and support services.",H3nchman_24,2025-04-29T18:09:22,9

"Whenever “up to” is used in a sentence, it’s best to just disregard it as trying to make a problem sound worse than it is.",Swagastan,2025-04-29T21:13:40,2
