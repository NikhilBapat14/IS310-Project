">Remember Harold Daggett, president of the International Longshoremen’s Association, who refused to endorse Kamala Harris and later gave Trump credit for averting an East Coast port strike when the credit actually belonged to the Biden administration? Trump is now working round the clock to put Daggett’s dockworkers out of a job. I wonder how long before they put Daggett out of a job. The same goes for Teamsters President Sean O’Brien, who also refused to endorse Harris and gave a cringeworthy speech at the Republican National Convention. The largest Teamsters employer, United Parcel Service, announced plans Tuesday to lay off 20,000 workers, citing tariffs as the reason.  It is incredibly stupid for any union member to vote for Republicans.  The Republican party has always been extremely hostile to unions and workers.  On the other hand the Democrats legalized unions and supported them ever since.  Unions are now going to face the consequences of helping get Trump elected.

"That may be part of it, but assuming it's just for personal enrichment is too narrow. These people have an ideology, and it is that the US should be an autarky. Anytime you completely undo the economy you are doing shock therapy, and that means people lose their jobs and the economy tumbles because everything has to be burned down then built back up.   Now to their credit, the Trump Administration is under no illusion that Americans are going to like it. They've been warning the people to prepare for higher prices or months now; it hasn't just been Trumps dolls comment. On the campaign trail Musk openly admitted that gutting the government may contribute to a recession, and I think Homan told a reporter Americans should just stop eating certain foods that can't be made in America (oh boy I can't wait until this reaches chocolate). This doesn't go that far because Trump was still promising to lower prices on the campaign trail, and after he was elected, then said it wasn't happening.   Now this just goes back to shock therapy. It hurts, but a lot of the time the people are willing to put up with it if it resolves the fundamental issues with the economy. That happened in the Eastern Bloc like in Poland or Czechia, which now have rapidly caught up to their Western Brethren, as well as currently in Argentina, where Milei's policies have tamed inflation. Of course, this is doing shock therapy in reverse. The US is in a unique position where it has a lot of resources and can be an autarky unlike a lot of countries, but we're going to be poorer for it in the long run. Things will cost more and we will make less money.   Anyway, the point is, the tariffs are meant to force everything to be made in America, as much as possible. A lot of companies have announced investments of new factories into America, from Nvidia to Maersk as a result, but many others have not. It will take time to see if this is actually effective, likely he's quietly keeping the IRA and Infrastructure bill to pay for a lot of it, though he's also kneecapping renewables to bring back coal and gas.   Even if it works, any economics student can see the result coming a mile away. Cutting off trade is a supply shock, even if everything is made in America it will still cost more even if wages are minimum. They keep claiming that we will have ""good paying"" factory jobs, but if there's a recession to force this to happen I fail to see how it would be good paying, especially when coupled with inflation from the supply shock. We will go through a lot of pain and burn all of our international standing to come out the other end working factory jobs for subpar wages and paying even higher prices.",DangerousCyclone,2025-05-01T16:05:17,6

"A component of the GDP is net exports. Net exports are exports minus imports (a trade surplus or deficit). Every U.S. company was scrambling to import as much as they could before the tariffs got worse and exports declined.

The latest projections expect the GDP to be about half of what it was last year so there’s plenty of additional downside possible.   The other GDP components:  Consumption: consumer spending is about 70% of the GDP. Consumers were still spending in Q1, but imagine what will happen when this slows down.

[https://time.com/7222411/blue-states-are-bailing-out-red-states/](https://time.com/7222411/blue-states-are-bailing-out-red-states/)  Red states are on average more dependent on financial help from the federal government compared to blue states.  If the federal coffers vanished tomorrow, then blue states would be better at financially supporting themselves without welfare.

The last time the US had a budget surplus was in 2001, when Democrat President Bill Clinton was leaving office.  Under the leadership of Republican George W. Bush, the US began running a deficit.  The last budget passed by Bush was for 2009, which was passed in 2008 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009\_United\_States\_federal\_budget).  Bush’s 2008 budget resulted in a sudden spike in the deficit from $0.45 trillion to $1.42 trillion, just in time for Democrat Obama’s first year in office.  By 2016, Obama was able to lower the deficit to $0.59 trillion.  By 2019, under the leadership of Republican Donald Trump, the deficit had gone back up to $0.98 trillion.  The deficit then spiked to $3.13 trillion in 2020 due to Covid.  As of 2024, Democrat Biden had brought the deficit back down to $1.83 trillion.  The pattern is clear - Democrats are better for the US federal treasury than Republicans.  https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-deficit/  Of the four presidents who had the most job creation under their leadership, three of them were Democrats: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs\_created\_during\_U.S.\_presidential\_terms.

"One third of Americans didn't vote. That's a lot of 14 year olds that turned 18 😭  At the end of the day, you have free will brug. How many more speeches and examples do they need to give to convince people to vote",No-Carrot4267,2025-05-01T15:13:15,5
"They only failed if they didn’t try. I have a better understanding now of your point of view, and I can only imagine how hopeless you might feel with all that you see around you. I also will not say there isn’t any truth in what you are saying—that we should demand more and better. But I also see people who I believe straight up didn’t try because they were more upset about their candidate not being the nominee vs educating themselves on just how much of a threat the opponent really was. You only failed if you didn’t try.",MichealVicksPuppy,2025-05-01T15:13:19,1

Voters are that bad. People voted him in and other people stood by and shrugged. What he and this admin does in office is on them AND the voters who stood by and decided protecting people was just too much effort.,DavidOrWalter,2025-05-02T08:05:56,1
"I don’t really care. I blame them because they deserve it.  This is Reddit, I’m not campaigning for office. And, frankly, with their silence they complicity endorsed fascism here at home, which is pretty unforgivable to me. They ruined all of our futures and all because they can’t do any basic reasoning, and I’m supposed to just move on?  No, fuck that, and fuck them.  Every single person that sat out last years election while an open fascist was on the ticket made an abhorrent choice that the world will be paying for, for probably the rest of our lives.",amanam0ngb0ts,2025-05-01T17:43:05,2
"They do have people in their lives.  Using rhetoric like a MAGAman only makes things worse.  Or are you of the mindset, can’t beat them so you’ll join them?",TryingToChillIt,2025-05-02T08:41:17,1
The post you’re responding to is about the person I’m responding to recommending panic buying toilet paper.  Your disagreement implies agreement with the subject of this thread.,samhouse09,2025-05-01T17:47:50,0
"Macroeconomic metrics weren't reflective of the mood or struggle with the economy as experienced by everyday people, I agree with you that the numbers that mattered to Democratic politicians that influenced their economic messaging were tone deaf. It's like touting how many jobs were created without saying anything about the quality of or the compensation for said jobs.",RedditTechAnon,2025-05-02T15:53:48,2
"Biden did have plans to make healthcare, childcare, housing, and higher education better. We would have gotten all of them if Republicans weren't so vehemently against anything that remotely makes life better for people. Republicans in the Senate straight up said ""nope, we can't have nice things,"" and then Biden got the blame for it.   Just from spending a day with a FOX News watching Trump supporter, you will hear them complain about how healthcare and housing have gotten insane. And then when Biden or Kamala lay out their plans to make these better, these same Trump supporters ardently oppose them with zero questions. They can't even say why they hate their ideas, it's like they suddenly think unaffordable healthcare, housing, and childcare is a good thing, and the more expensive they are the freer we are.",x_xHaunter313,2025-05-01T22:48:18,3

No you don't know that we can't assume that all of the vote that didn't turn out would have broken for Kamala,Chainsawjack,2025-05-01T22:02:52,0
"Well considering we have been saying that demographically the whole country would be blue when gen z  hits and then they broke largely for Trump i would say you mock at them to our peril.  And in fact we do know that the youth vote is the biggest apathy non voting demographic so yeah actually a lot of 18 year olds didn't vote, what else is new.  My question is why is your solution top down and not bottom up?  Why is it that you think they need to give more speeches and set more examples when what they really need to do is listen more and promise to improve on the things that they hear?",Chainsawjack,2025-05-01T15:34:56,1

"No. You keep telling me I said stuff I never said. I responded to your implication that since toilet paper is made domestically, there will not be a shortage. Which is blatantly false.",jascgore,2025-05-01T17:52:48,2
Its called cognitive dissonance.,Maravich77,2025-05-02T12:30:17,1
"What does that have to do with my opinion? I blame the voters who were ok with the anti democratic choice. Period. I am not part of any party. I don't even see them shifting blame to nebulous others anyway.   And I straight up disagree with a lot of the people making claims like yours. Maybe not you in particular... I don't know your exact position. But for example all the people who were trying to punish the dems for not being strong enough on palestine... well first off the other option is worse, so grats on that. Second it wasn't the winning issue those people think it was. The dems would have lost votes on that no matter the side they took. ",LSF604,2025-05-01T16:01:21,5
"Fundamentally our views on this are different man. So just agree to disagree.   People are gonna hurt through another 4 years and still vote for trump. Or they're gonna blame the Democrats for not stopping trump in office.  It's life, nobody is gonna hold your hand and walk you through every single decision. Maybe they should've dumbed down politics like the right did since it seems like people can't do critical thinking anymore to see what's in their best interests instead of being told outright or something  Honestly, I'm pretty sure Gaza supporters were told outright and they still voted for trump. And now they're confused. It's pretty straightforward tbh.   I'm done here. Cya",No-Carrot4267,2025-05-01T15:52:38,3
