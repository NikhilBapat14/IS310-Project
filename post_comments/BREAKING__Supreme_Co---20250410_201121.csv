"guys, I don't think this is a win. I think that the news article or image title in this post is severely misleading.  What actually happened:  >The Supreme Court is essentially declining to directly mandate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, acknowledging its limitations and indicating that it may not have the power to direct the executive branch explicitly to repatriate him. Instead, it directs the lower court to clarify its order, noting that it's ultimately the executive branch's responsibility to manage foreign affairs and effectuate such returns.  >The Supreme Court is asking the District Court judge to clarify what she means by instructing the executive branch to ""effectuate"" the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia. In other words, the Supreme Court found the original order from the lower court unclear and possibly too broad. It‚Äôs asking the lower court to reconsider or clarify its directive, making sure that the revised order respects the separation of powers and the authority of the executive branch to conduct foreign policy.  ELI5 version: >The Supreme Court is saying: ""We agree the government messed up by deporting this person wrongly, but we can't directly order the president or executive branch exactly how to fix it. Lower court, please clarify your instructions to make sure you're not stepping on the executive branch's toes. It's up to the executive branch to actually handle bringing him back.""
