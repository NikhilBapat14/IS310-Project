"Congress as a whole has largely delegated legislative action to the Executive through inaction and gridlock. But it is worth remembering that in 2018-2020, when Pelosi was Speaker, the House passed a record amount of legislation (that went nowhere in the Senate). There are clearly people in Congress willing to do the work, but both houses are moribund with members dedicated to the status quo.   I don't think there's much the Democrats in Congress actually can do right now. They have the choice of being vocal and ineffective, or quiet and (at best) docile. I do suspect, with the trajectory the Trump administration is on, there will come an inflection point where things change. I won't pretend to predict the future, so I don't know if that shift will come from elected officials or the general population, but we're barely two months in and so much has happened, push back is inevitable.

And because of this hyper-partisan environment, both in Congress and among the electorate, neither side has held a large enough majority in both the houses to actually pass any truly meaningful legislation. We've gotten a few big bills through reconciliation, but nothing that could noticeably change the status quo for the working class has been able to make it though Congress since before Obama took office.

Trump can fire his Chief of Staff, Trump can fire the Secretary of the Treasury...Because they are executive officers.  Trump cant fire federal employees under the Chief of Staff and under the Secretary of the Treasury who are not executive officers.  Again this is written into the U.S. Constitution.  You are not arguing with me, you are arguing with the U.S. Constitution and hundreds of years of case history through the U.S. Courts.  You are digging yourself a hole.  The Secretary of the Treasury can fire federal employees but they cant make spending cuts, meaning they would need to replace the staff they fired.  If they cut staff by 50% they would be guilty of seditious conspiracy and treason.  When Trump makes massive spending cuts to federal departments and enforces mass lay offs, without the consent of Congress in violation of the U.S. Constitution.

The president could choose to manage staff themselves if they wanted, which entirely disproves your argument that they can only fire senate approved political appointees.   Again, none of what you said is written in the constitution. The president has ultimate and complete executive power. Thats what the constitution says. The only limits the constitution places on the presidents executive power is that the congress can create politically appointed offices that require senate approval.  It says nothing about the president not being able to fire people or not being able to hire for positions that aren’t statutorily created political offices.   The congress **authorizes** budgets and responsibilities. It’s not illegal to not spend all that money. If people retire, if they quit, if there’s a department doesn’t have a Christmas party one year — there’s going to be money in the budget left over. Anyone who’s ever worked at an organization knows that actual spending never matches the yearly budget. It’s not “seditious conspiracy or treason” to not spend the entire authorized budget. So long as the duties and responsibilities and laws are executed, it doesn’t matter how much money the executive spends.  Trump is the head executive.  Not a king. A king passes laws by himself.

You have the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.  And various other legislation and court cases.  That clearly outlines that the President cant cut spending.  The President or a head of a Department conspires to overthrow or to destroy an agency by significantly reducing its staff or spending...That is seditious conspiracy.  If people retire, they hire new workers.  This isnt about a single Christmas party, this is about an intentional effort to dismantle government from within.  The duties and responsibilities of the agencies, the laws are not being adhered to...  You go agency by agency and within the few months Trump has been in office you have systematic disruptions and disorder in every single Department and office thats been affected.
