"We keep having things that have never happened before happening in government lately. In theory, the courts could call the marshals as someone said, but then the president literally controls the DOJ right now. People would literally have to go against his wishes and arrest him and then all hell would break loose probably physically as well as legally.   It's the same with the military. Allegedly when he was in office the first time, he kept insinuating about doing a variety of things that had the higher ups in the military frightened. Again allegedly they had private discussions about which orders they would refuse to carry out if he gave them in order to basically save the world. Things are different now because he has a lot more in the way of ass kissers in key positions as opposed to adults in the room.

"It's not powerless, their rulings become precedent for lower courts to follow, and even for the Supreme Court itself (until they overturn such ruling).  But there is no mechanism for enforcing a ruling against the executive branch.  Judicial rulings overall are enforced by law enforcement agencies, not by the court itself.  The problem is that the chief law enforcement agency in the federal government, the Justice Department, falls under the executive branch.  The Founding Fathers devised a way of dealing with this scenario: the legislative branch would impeach and remove the President from office if they did not follow a judicial ruling.  But the current political environment is so toxic that there is enough support in the legislative branch for disregarding Supreme Court decisions that runs counter to the MAGA vision for the US.  There isn't enough support for impeachment of Trump, let alone his removal.  This was not something the Founding Fathers could have foreseen.  I'm not 100% sure if there is a way to enforce a Supreme Court ruling against the legislative branch either, to be perfectly honest.  And the more I think about it, I'm not so sure about entities outside the federal government.  If a state wanted to ignore Obergefell v. Hodges, for example, what way would there be to force a state to honor same sex marriages?  I think that Supreme Court rulings depend on the relevant parties following such rulings.

"All of society is a gentleman's agreement - ideas like the three branches are social constructs, they have power to the degree people act like they do.   Take DOGE - theoretically that entity has no power at all, yet they are able to close down agencies. This is not because they are part of the executive, but because a critical amount of people believe in their power right now, most importantly DOGE themselves.   The supreme court judges might be able to act, or convince others to act, to enforce their rulings. For instance, the supreme court has its own police force which answers directly to them. If they were able to persuade enough of society of their right to do so, they could add 1.000.000 people to the court police force and take over D.C., arresting anyone who opposed them and ruling from the bench. This is insanely unlikely of course, but only because persuading people to do that would be very hard, while persuading people that ""The president is the one who decides everything"" is comparatively easy, because that is what naive people have always believed.   So we'll see how much sway they have in society, and what they can convince society to do. But make no mistake, this is not about the judicial branch being particularly powerless due to lack of enforcement opportunities. It is because a critical mass of people currently don't believe judges have much power over the executive. In a different world you'd be saying ""Is the president and legislature just completely powerless, given that the court can strike down everything they do?""",Lower_Set7084,2025-04-13T13:13:34,1

Kinda goes to what I remember asking way back in the 90s in high school in our government class.   If no law enforcement or military or anyone enforces what some judge or court says. Then what power do they really have? Couldn't you just choose to ignore them provided all the enforcement end is on your side?   Essentially yes. All court's/judge's power exists on basically the honor system. No one has ever said no to them yet that's all you in theory have to do. Again provided the enforcement branch is on your side.

One thing that strongly need to be considered is moving the justice department under the purview of the supreme court.  What I mean by this is that the head of that department should be the court itself.  It provides an insolation against the executive branch from removing officers of the court on a whim.  And allows them to have final say on hiring and firing decisions.  The setup I would have in mind would be that the executive branch can go ahead and choose to hire and fire people in the Justice Department.  But the final say for EVEYRTHING as far as hiring and firing is the Supreme Court itself.  This would prevent the situation we find ourselves in now.  So when Bondi fired the prosecutors in the Adams case the Supreme Court can stop this cold.  They don't need to issue a ruling.  But they can prevent this types of miscarriage of justice.  Further this prevents what is currently happening because the president no longer is the ultimate boss on legal matters.  You can setup deference to the executive branch on roles.  But you also at the same time can have a clear and definite way for the judicial to have the power necessary to carry out there judgements and override the president.,Wermys,2025-04-16T18:20:18,1

"The power of the federal judiciary doesn't end at criminal enforcement, it also extends to its civil law powers. Beyond calling on the Marshals Service, court rulings have consequences via non-government actors and state-level law enforcement.  If the Court rules that the executive cannot do a thing and then the executive does that thing, if the Court is consistent in its rulings, the executive is acting outside of its official powers and the Court can award civil damages against the government officials themselves. These damages can be claimed from the officials' personal accounts at financial institutions (given that financial institutions are not part of the government and directly responsible to the Executive and so will comply with a court order), or claims on physical property supervised by state law enforcement.  Obviously if all of society decides to disregard the judiciary, then it is powerless, but the judiciary effectively has powers to punish that do not rely on people who serve under the President. The ability of the Courts to send a government official to jail over an obstructionist DOJ is complicated - the ability of the Courts to bankrupt a government official is pretty straightforward.  EDIT: Also, civil compensation for damages done by federal officials acting outside of their office is not an ""offense against the United States"", not a criminal penalty, and so is outside of the President's pardon powers.",just_helping,2025-04-13T23:16:24,6

"I went through this in the first comment you replied to. State law enforcement (for example, New York State Police, who are not in the President's chain of command) and private financial institutions obeying court orders, or, if they fail to, again local police.  The point is that people on reddit have become obsessed with the direct criminal enforcement via law enforcement that is subservient to the President via the Department of Justice. That route is potentially compromised. But the federal courts don't just decide on federal crimes. They also assess whether state level prosecutions can happen and whether federal officials have civil immunity. The authority of the Courts is far broader and built into civil society than a simple chain of command picture would make it seem. The DOJ refusing to obey a court order would remove the simplest and most direct route of accountability, but hardly the first or last. Power is more spread about than people seem to think.",just_helping,2025-04-15T02:01:14,2

The courts do not possess the power to deputize people or form a posse to enforce their rulings, as multiple statutes explicitly granting that power to the Marshals make clear. If the power to do that lay with the courts (which it did under the common law that those statutes abrogated) then those statutes would not have been included.     > Of course then we get into an uncomfortable conversation about whether we prefer being ruled by 5/9 justices or ruled by 1 cult of personality.

"Right, but state and local officials can be _blocked_ from enforcing state and local law by federal preemption, and the federal courts are the ones determining whether federal preemption holds.  Let's make this concrete, since people appear to keep misunderstanding the point. Kilmar Ábrego García was taken by federal officials in Maryland. If the federal officials were not acting within their office, this is kidnapping, which is against Maryland state law and can be prosecuted in Maryland state courts and Maryland state law enforcement. If the federal officials are acting within their office, it cannot, the federal officials have criminal immunity. Further, kidnapping a person obviously may give raise to civil claims, either by Mr. García or his family, who have both obviously been hurt and due compensation. If federal officials are acting within their office, they enjoy civil immunity. If they are not, they don't and they can be personally sued for damages. These determinations - whether the federal officials enjoy immunity from state criminal charges and whether they enjoy immunity from civil suit - are determined by the federal court system.  So, while the federal courts decision on the criminal liability of federal officials may be ignored by US Marshals because they have countermanding orders from the DOJ, this doesn't actually render the federal courts irrelevant or powerless. They can make a finding that the federal officials have acted unlawfully and outside of their office, permitting the officials to be criminally prosecuted by the states and sued for damages by private individuals.  >Private institutions only obey because they know that if they don’t then some enforcement agency will show up and take action against them. Remove that and they no longer have any reason to comply.  This is not quite true either. I don't think it is relevant, because again, if a federal official is found not to enjoy civil immunity, be found liable for damages, the seizure of their assets would be conducted by state law enforcement - but it is also not quite true.  If a bank refuses to comply with a court order (because it thinks that no enforcement agency will show up) that doesn't make the court order go away. Instead the finances of the bank become legally clouded - how many assets does the bank actually have, how leveraged actually is it, how capable of paying its debts - and the bank's reputation for obeying contracts (contracts that afterall are adjudicated by the same court system that the bank is refusing to obey the orders of) becomes questioned. This means that other banks take on new risks dealing with the non compliant bank, and the costs and financial friction caused by these risks basically freeze the non compliant bank out of the financial system.  Obviously, if the bank is in Russia or elsewhere, and does essentially no business with US banks, then it may not care. But almost every financial institution in the world wants to be in the US market, will care that it carries new counter party risk, and will seek to comply with judgements.  Compliance with the judgements of reputable arbitrators doesn't actually need enforcement, voluntary compliance occurs if parties wish to keep getting new contracts. Many foreign companies and sovereign nations without US assets that would be liable to direct seizure still deliberately voluntarily submit to NY state courts because they want access to global financial markets.  So yes, even in the absence of enforcement, private institutions have reasons to comply with financial judgements.",just_helping,2025-04-17T01:11:10,0

"> Right, but state and local officials can be blocked from enforcing state and local law by federal preemption, and the federal courts are the ones determining whether federal preemption holds.    If this is your base premise then the rest isn’t worth reading, as this is a commandeering issue and not one of preemption.     > So, while the federal courts decision on the criminal liability of federal officials may be ignored by US Marshals because they have countermanding orders from the DOJ, this doesn't actually render the federal courts irrelevant or powerless. They can make a finding that the federal officials have acted unlawfully and outside of their office, permitting the officials to be criminally prosecuted by the states and sued for damages by private individuals.    This gets into *Neagle* and similar decisions, and the end result is still that the state cannot enforce state law against federal officials acting as such, even if their actions are unlawful. The finding of fact as far as whether or not removal doctrine applies still lies with the federal judicial system, which blocks the state from acting on it’s own as you are positing.     > This is not quite true either. I don't think it is relevant, because again, if a federal official is found not to enjoy civil immunity, be found liable for damages, the seizure of their assets would be conducted by state law enforcement - but it is also not quite true.    You’re still starting from a faulty premise here because you are apparently not aware of what the law actually is. State law enforcement cannot ever be ordered to perform a specific act on behalf of the federal courts under any circumstances, nor are they empowered to do so of their own accord unless they are deputized as special DUSMs. It’s why southern governors stopped using National Guard troops to resist desegregation and started using state troopers—as state officials they could not be ordered to enforce a federal court action, whereas NG troops could be federalized and used to enforce those orders.   > If a bank refuses to comply with a court order (because it thinks that no enforcement agency will show up) that doesn't make the court order go away.

Banks and other corporations refuse to comply with those orders all the time. All that they’d do is appeal it, and that ends enforcement action while the appeal is adjudicated. If the standoff as far as enforcement was still ongoing by the time it is adjudicated the appeals court will find a face saving way to void the order, because openly admitting that there is no way to force compliance with their orders is the last thing that any judge will do—Marshall took that exact step in *Marbury* for that exact reason.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-17T02:27:59,0

"You are still confused. We are not looking at commandeering. We are not looking at federal enforcement at all.

Let's look at Neagle, specifically:  >[United States officers and other persons,- held in custody by state authorities for doing acts which they were authorized or required to do by the Constitution -and laws of the United States, are entitled to be released , from such imprisonment;](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/92766/in-re-neagle/?q=""135%20U.S.%20""&type=o&order_by=dateFiled%20asc&stat_Precedential=on&filed_after=01%2F01%2F1890&filed_before=01%2F01%2F1891&court=scotus)  Neagle specifically limits the immunity of federal officials from state enforcement to acts that are ""acts which they were authorized or required to do by the Constitution -and laws of the United States"". We are specifically talking about a situation where the case has gone through the federal system, gone through the appellate process, and the federal official has been found to not be acting in accordance with the Constitution, and so has lost the protection of _Neagle_.  >adjudicated the appeals court will find a face saving way to void the order, because openly admitting that there is no way to force compliance with their orders is the last thing that any judge will do  I don't disagree that the federal appeals court might want to back down and find a face saving exercise. But again, we are talking about a scenario where we have gone through the appellate process and SCOTUS has looked at Nixon v. Fitzgerald, and found that the act that say Trump is claiming civil immunity for lies outside of the outermost perimeter of his duties. There is no unqualified immunity for the President or executive officials.  Once the appellate process is exhausted, I do not believe any bank in the US will refuse to obey a court order.
