And at that moment, Dr. Phil angrily and pompously tried to act like he had the high ground and kicked the Bumfights guy off his show?  Yeah, Phil, a lot of us saw through that. We knew you could tell he was right. By having him on your show, you were exploiting the suffering of those homeless people just as much as he was. You looked into the mirror and you were sickened by what you saw and cowardly ran from it.  Phil's no better than a man who exploits the homeless in order to create entertainment.
