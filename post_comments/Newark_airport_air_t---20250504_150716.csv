"Newark is a shitty airport, and has been since at least the 80s when my dad flew regularly.  I avoid any layovers in Newark.  The few times I’ve been through there make me wonder why it hasn’t been bulldozed already.",j3remy2007,2025-05-04T15:25:02,46

It’s *okay*. Better than JFK imo and it’s easy to get there since they have an Amtrak station.,zip117,2025-05-04T15:42:53,32
"You REALLY don't want to. If you have a connecting flight it's a coin toss whether you'll actually make it and if there's any kind of weather, just start looking for hotels. It is the worst major airport on the East coast.",ngoni,2025-05-04T17:27:02,19
Jfk is only one extra transfer.     Penn to Jamaica then get on the JFK tran,Junknail,2025-05-04T18:01:32,10
"EWR is just about the scariest place on earth to be on a Friday afternoon between 4-7 pm for an outbound flight. If the weather is bad, you have no chance.   Early in the morning, as in 6am departures, are much better. I never had an issue there at that time. I often scheduled return flights Saturday morning early instead of Friday afternoon/evening. Just got burnt too many times.",jcr2022,2025-05-04T18:06:10,8
"True but those LIRR trains can get *packed* if you have luggage and it’s easier for people in Philly and South Jersey to take Amtrak, otherwise you have to take NJTransit and transfer at Trenton.  It’s not as bad as you’d think since they coordinate schedules. Idk I’ve had bad experiences at so many airports in the northeast so it’s hard for me to express preference for any one of them.",zip117,2025-05-04T18:12:25,8
I've only had issue or seen others with issues during holiday and it was still okay.  Those trains run constantly to Jamaica.    If first time it can be weird ,Junknail,2025-05-04T19:27:07,2
