Putin has no interest in the current deal. What he wants is to get economic normalization with the US (economic isolation is the most immediate threat to the Russian war effort) without having to agree to a deal. Bribing the Trump Admin with some oil/gas concessions is much cheaper than the sanctions Putin would then like to propose some counteroffer that doesn't offend Trump but which Kyiv will never agree to to give Trump an excuse to ditch Kyiv and pretend the war is about something else. I would be shocked if he signs the deal.  The reality of the situation is that Russia is probably in big trouble come late 2025/early 2026 in a world where US sanctions were tightening and weapons aid held fine. In the event the US ditches Ukraine and opens the pressure release valves on the Russian economy a peace-deal is still probably somewhat preferable for Russia then fighting on for two more years but it probably can wager time is on it's side and press the war for another year and try to gain more concessions later. Putin obviously doesn't care about how many Russians die to get from point A->B on that. I'm not sure the Russians will win and the long-term effects on the Russian economy will likely be devastating but the odds are not terrible for the Russians either in a world where the US ditches Ukraine.,somethingicanspell,2025-03-13T20:44:21,90
"If Putin asks for Ukraine to receive no arms and do no training during a ceasefire of a war he started, while gaining arms himself and training his troops it is a non starter.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-03-13T20:55:52,36
"Neither Ukraine or Russia is really interested in a ceasefire the other would accept.  Currently, Russia is on the offensive, the elite of the Ukrainian forces have just been largely kicked out of Kursk. Manpower shortages are extreme. Equipment is lacking and Russians are getting close to the last fortified lines of defense. Ukraine would love to have a 30-day ceasefire just to mobilize more men, prepare more fortifications and get more military aid.  Russia knows this and doesn't want to agree to a break that would simply serve the Ukrainians to prepare for renewed fighting.  But Putin can't just say no, he wants ultimately normalization and getting on the good side of Trump is the best way to that. So instead of refusing, he says ""30 days of ceasefire but the Ukrainians stop mobilizing and training soldiers"", a demand which Ukraine is unlikely to accept.  So if Ukraine refuses Russia's conditions, it will blame Russia for the failure of the ceasefire, and Russia will blame Ukraine.",kchoze,2025-03-13T22:26:12,21

Putin will demand a bunch of unreasonable stuff knowing trump wants so badly to say he made a deal that he will fuck over Ukraine. The only way putin signs a deal is if he badly needs Ukraine to stop shooting at him while he is trying to put gas in a tank. As soon as the tank is refilled he will aim the gun and start shooting again.,CaptainLucid420,2025-03-13T21:03:04,18
"Using Tяump as a negotiator is ridiculous; he's doing nothing of the sort. This is exactly what he did in Afghanistan; held talks with just the Taliban*, only going to the Afghan government to get concessions or else he'd pull out the US troops. Then, he ~~lied~~ claimed that the Afghanis weren't  cooperating enough and gave the whole country to the Taliban.     ...which benefited Ruzzia as well.  Fortunately, Zelenskyy is aware of this, which is why he's talking so much with EU and UK leaders; he knows Tяump will try to throw him under the bus.

"I really don’t see what Putin would gain from this ceasefire at this point. Obviously fewer people would die, but I doubt he cares.  Theoretically it could be used to freeze the conflict, in which case Russia would de facto annex the east. But currently Russia has the momentum in the war, they’ve nearly retaken Kursk and the front is slowly moving west, so I would expect Putin feels he has more to gain by continuing the slaughter.

Tactically they have the upper hand at the moment, with nothing to suggest this will change.  Trump is providing them with options, they are likely to keep Trump in play by satisfying his ego. As Trump has waved the 'olive branch' they are probably likely weighting the pros of having a (sort of)  friend in the White House they can exploit, and how they will exploit, than turning him into an enemy.     How long will they hold out - as long as possible, definitely until after they have regained control over occupied territory.     Will they find a excuse to recommence after the 30 days - definitely having taken advantage of the ceasefire to  reorganise and reinforce recent successes.",Intelligent-Star-684,2025-03-14T02:07:13,1

"Putin has no interest in a genuine peace or ceasefire because of what it means for him. Americans have this delusion that this war was about NATO or that Russia wants peace, but the reality is the exact opposite. Putin is only interested in a peace that he can declare victory; even in these so-called negotiations, his demands have not changed and are nonnegotiable according to the Russians. This is an emerging threat, and if Putin wins, it means an emboldened imperialist Russia no different than a reimergent nazi Germany in the 1920s. Russia will only grow stronger and stronger; the preparation and rapid rearmament have already begun. It's just that right now, Russia is bogged down in Ukraine and losing if Western support continues. Seriously though, Russia is killing its troops that retreat as a matter of policy. It has committed many of the worst atrocities seen since WW2. Putin is threatening and terrorizing the US and the world with nuclear proliferation if we don't give him exactly what he wants. Seriously anyone with any doubt about the dangers of apeasement right now needs to wake up. The dumbest shit we could do is give in to russian demands. Right now we face the choice between peace and war that president Reagan talked about.  ""There’s no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there’s only one guaranteed way. You can have peace and you can have it in the next second. Surrender. Admittedly, there’s a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement and this is the specter. Our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face that their policy of accommodation is appeasement and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender.  If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand, the ultimatum. And what? Then when Nikita Cruz, Jeff has told his people, he knows what our answer will be. He has told them that we are retreating under the pressure of the Cold War. And someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary because by that time, we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically.  He believes this because from our side, he’s heard voices pleading for peace at any price or better read than death, or as one commentator put it, he’d rather live on his knees than die on his feet. And therein lies the road to war because those voices don’t speak for the rest of us. You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace, so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery.""  Today, we are facing that Final ultimatum from a trashy dictator who wants to rebuild the Russian Empire.

"Oh I agree. I think Trump just places a ton of value on things like energy and mineral wealth in a way that is pretty dumb. Case in point the Ukraine mineral deal. The Ukrainians in reality do not have exceptional mineral wealth. It's worth maybe 10s of billions of dollars. It was a lot of political capital spent over nothing. Putin hopes Trump will vastly overestimate the value of Russian business.   I think large-scale western investment is a bird that has flown. Yes business-men in the west would be happy to sell the Russians stuff and maybe speculate in Russian markets. However, no one is making hundreds of million dollar investments in Russia after all the confiscations that happen. The Russians probably couldn't afford to pay most of the people whose assets they seized the first time either. If the Russians want any big project in the future they're paying most of the capital costs or putting tons of collateral in a US bank account. No one is going to bet the house on stable US-Russian relations.   The strategic issue I think is less actually trump opening up business with the Russians on the US end. It's the end of third parties caring even a little bit about sanctions. If the whole world thinks the US has stopped caring about selling the Russians western goods openly or military goods than the Russians are going to have a much easier time.

"I would divide this into three separate claims  1. What are the likely short-term effects of US sanctions on Russia  It's more or less an open secret that the Russian Central Bank does not believe the war economy is sustainable much past the end of the year or the end of next year at best. Whether they can maneuver the economy to land in the economic doldrums or whether a major recession is coming is up for debate. The current situation is that the Russians face a 10.1% inflation rate despite slamming on the breaks with a massive 21% borrowing rate. The big worry for the CBR is that companies borrowing at 21% need to make a 21% return  in order not to take a loss on investment and yet they keep borrowing. This is realistically very hard to do without  raising prices substantially and so the ability of Russian monetary policy to continue to prevent inflation is very much in doubt. Worse is the potential that if the Russian economy enters a recession with tons of businesses having taken out loans that they can no longer cover it could cripple the Russian economy. So Russia must thread a needle. It's not secret that the underlying cause of Russia's economic woes is not market corrections but an inability to produce consumer goods and a shrinking labor supply due to emigration, casualties, and the high and unstable cost of smuggling western components. There are a variety of other problems like the lack of investment in long-term infrastructure due to war spending. The loss of the Western market etc etc. Without relief these problems will be at best bad and at worst recessionary relatively soon.  2. Why haven't US sanctions on Russia crippled the Russian economy quickly  First, while some industries e.g Natural Gas have been crippled in Russia the US and the West largely balked at crippling the Russian oil export market and past on the opportunity to truly force countries to choose between trading with Russia and the US. For this I blame Biden and Scholz although Trump is vastly worse than either than them in this regard. Still, oil is largely what the Russians needed for cash flow and without actually enforcing secondary sanctions on refiners who bought Russian oil the West largely balked on going for the jugular.  Second and more importantly sanctions rarely work quickly. The US has sanctioned Iran to death since the mid-2000s and now its economy has been basically collapsing since the late 2010s but sanctions while having significant short and medium term effect really kill economies slowly.  3. What are the long-term effects of US sanctions on Russia  The slow poison that Putin knows will destroy the Russian economy is that the new Russian autarkic economy largely produces substandard manufactured goods at inflated costs rather than having products that are actually competitive on export markets. Creating a temporary stimulus by building artillery shells is even less useful for the broader Russian economy. Moreover, the Russians without Western Finance are now almost wholly dependent on using oil revenues to provide liquidity to their industries meaning that there industries will be hyper sensitive to oil market shocks and face the inevitable imbalances of resource cursed countries. All of this is probably from a 20-30 year perspective fatal for a country. It lacks the capital to compete with the West on productivity gains, lacks the cheap labor supply to undercut prices from the third world, and lacks the market access to compete with either.  Now does this mean the Russian economy is likely to collapse in 1-2 years. Maybe to a limited extent although not necessarily. However, Russian decision-makers now that the deeper into a false autarkic economy it seeks that more disastrous the correction and that is not a trivial factor in Russia's considerations.",somethingicanspell,2025-03-14T15:13:21,2

At the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, **Putin boasted that Ukraine would fall quickly**, with some reports indicating he and his inner circle expected Kyiv to be captured **within days** and the Ukrainian government to collapse.  # Key Boasts & Miscalculations:  1. **Ukraine Would Crumble Quickly** – Russian leadership reportedly believed Ukrainian forces would either surrender or be ineffective, underestimating both Ukraine’s military and public resistance. 2. **Kyiv Would Fall in 72 Hours** – U.S. and Western intelligence sources later revealed that Putin expected a quick ""decapitation strike"" to remove President Zelensky and install a puppet government. 3. **Ukrainians Would Welcome Russia as Liberators** – The Kremlin assumed significant pro-Russian sentiment, particularly in eastern Ukraine, would lead to easy occupation and limited resistance. 4. **The West Would Do Nothing** – Putin likely expected a weak Western response, based on previous reactions to Crimea (2014) and other aggressive Russian actions. 5. **Russia’s Military Superiority Would Overwhelm Ukraine** – Moscow’s public rhetoric implied that its military was vastly superior and that Ukrainian defenses would collapse in the face of a full invasion.  # What Actually Happened:  * Ukrainian forces, backed by Western intelligence and weapons, **held Kyiv** and forced Russia into a humiliating retreat from the north. * The invasion **galvanized NATO**, rather than weakening it, leading to stronger military and economic support for Ukraine. * Putin **misjudged both Ukraine’s will to fight and Russia’s own military readiness**, leading to massive Russian losses and an ongoing war.

"Thank you very much for your interesting information and perspective.  I really enjoyed thinking about and responding to it.  I'm writing this at the end and moving it to the top.  I suspect I might come off like a jerk, so hopefully this softens any of that instead of making you hyper aware of looking for it.  I have some kind of personality flaw that stops me from thinking non-confrontationally.    >The current situation is that the Russians face a 10.1% inflation rate despite slamming on the breaks with a massive 21% borrowing rate.   The US is at 2.8% and about 8%.  So we are definitely more profitable, as a banking sector.  But the 21/10.1 spread is still well enough for their banks to make money, and have room to refinance customers down when soldier bonuses end and there's less money churning around with no one to spend it.    >very hard to do without raising prices substantially and so the ability of Russian monetary policy to continue to prevent inflation is very much in doubt.  This is probably some genuine issue on my part.  If they have 10.1% inflation, how is their inability to prevent inflation not already apparent?    >It's not secret that the underlying cause of Russia's economic woes is not market corrections but an inability to produce consumer goods and a shrinking labor supply due to emigration, casualties, and the high and unstable cost of smuggling western components. There are a variety of other problems like the lack of investment in long-term infrastructure due to war spending.  This I wholeheartedly agree with.  On the one hand it's the present costs of the war.  And on the other call them the present-future costs, because of the loss of investment in better endeavors.    On a long enough time line, that's definitely extinction.  But winning a war can bounce back pretty substantially from all those costs.  Especially here, where they are handing locally substantial sums of money to lower middle class men to go fight the war.  When they come back they're going to get married and have a nest egg to start out with.  They'll have bargaining power to look for employment that could be a career.  Groups of these men will have money to start businesses.    >some industries e.g Natural Gas have been crippled in Russia   Crippled is an interesting word.  The recent information is nebulous, at least this seems okay for the lead up to the war:  https://www.statista.com/statistics/265335/natural-gas-production-in-russia-since-1998/  For 2024 I can't find a source other than the Russian government.  I won't bother linking anything, not like it really matters.  They say 685 billion cubic meters.  I think that means if it is crippled, they are lying, like ridiculously.  The trend kept going down and it's actually in the mid 500's or something.    >the West largely balked at crippling the Russian oil export market and past on the opportunity to truly force countries to choose between trading with Russia and the US.  This is a great point.  There were military commitments we were not going to make and financial ones along side them.  I admit to having limited my thinking to ""other than the red lines we drew for ourselves.""  Though that is also a slight argument, in that I think this was straightforward self interest.  The global oil market is a finicky beast that we need humming for life to go right.  I suspect it's similar with some aspects of the European economy (specifically I think we might have chemical industries that worked out niche specializations out of the expectation of being able to trade freely).    >The US has sanctioned Iran to death since the mid-2000s and now its economy has been basically collapsing since the late 2010s but sanctions while having significant short and medium term effect really kill economies slowly.  Heck yeah, now do Cuba.  That's a flat out embargo that's riding wheels that might take it through a century.      If I tried to tell people we should just stop messing with Cuba, do you think I'd be called a Castro sympathizer or something?  By the by, I know that Miguel Díaz-Canel is the president of Cuba.  That doesn't change what I'd expect to be called.    >The slow poison that Putin knows will destroy the Russian economy is that the new Russian autarkic economy largely produces substandard manufactured goods at inflated costs rather than having products that are actually competitive on export markets.  I don't know man.  It seems like such are the ravages of a second world economy.  Obviously historical precedent is clear: that can't last for more than several decades.  But the problems might easily clear up after the war.    The US was able to keep the ""embargo"" against Iraq up after 1991.  I used the quotes because the term isn't accurate and I couldn't think of a better one.  And as you said, a similar kind of situation, though less severe, has been going on with Iran for a long time.  The problem we face here is that our proxy is on course to lose this war, and so I don't think the foreigners facing counter sanctions are going to see any inclination of justice to them.",rcglinsk,2025-03-15T13:42:25,1

"To paraphrase James Goldman; a nation is a human thing, it does what we do and for our reasons. Russia has historically had a problem with offensive wars. On the defense she's almost unbeaten. But I can't think of a single offensive war that she has fought to what could rationally be called a successful conclusion. This is, it is my belief, because she is a much more culturally and ethnically diverse nation than she appears from the outside - and this is a problem. This means that the cultural and ethnic minorities do not really have (at least it appears) representation or advocacy in the government. You might think that wouldn't matter in a repressive regime like Putin's, but it is even more crucial. A group that does not feel represented does not feel beholden to the country they reside in. They go to fight because they are forced to, often under threat. This will not motivate an army to victory. Threat of destruction is the only motivator that will have success in an army that is built on this foundation. This statement holds up throughout history and does not just apply to Russia or the Soviet Union which preceded her or the Russian Empire that preceded *it*. The Will to Win is an absolute necessity on any level of military engagement.
