"You can vote for whoever you think best represents you or prefer. In America we vote for candidates, not parties.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-11-01T08:17:48,1
so you can vote in multiple lines? (for example  Democrat for president and republican for state rep?)  specifically talking about NY,Donghoon,2024-11-01T15:50:01,1
Yes for any state and territory. Pretty sure it'd be unconstitutional for mandatory party only voting due to its text specifying that **the people** shall elect their representatives and such.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-11-01T17:21:08,1
okay good to hear. i got scared my ballot will be invalidated that I voted in one line  fusion voting (same candidate running on multiple party) is weird tho,Donghoon,2024-11-02T13:31:00,1
