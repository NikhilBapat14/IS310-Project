"And as usual our discourse about this is going to be ~100% about Trump lying, being stupid, being delusional…and approximately 0% about the fact that enough free-willed grown-ass adults in America consistently choose to mindlessly go along with the lies.  And also as usual this sentiment will be met with pathetic coddling excuses for these people - calling them brainwashed, victims of media, poorly educated (shoutout to all the well-off suburban MAGA people out there)…anything other than holding free-willed grownups responsible for their willful stupidity, moral failures, and shitty choices.  EDIT - my comment is a valid point about the general direction of our discourse. That does not come with an obligation to answer “sO wHaT dO wE dO tHeN?” (First rule of the internet - never follow an ad hominem contrarian down their rabbit hole).  My. Point. Is. we have the analysis exactly backwards. The lies are only told because they have an audience.",JeffSteinMusic,2025-04-30T12:22:12,46

"And after telling all his people he was going to do it, on purpose.  Why are they upset? When he said “there will be tough times ahead” did they think the times wouldnt apply to them?
