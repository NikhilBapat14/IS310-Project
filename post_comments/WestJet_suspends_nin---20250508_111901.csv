"As a Canadian, it's not only incredibly alarming that flights are being reduced heading into the busy summer season, but they are eliminating flights where they are the only direct flight to some US cities. This is such a strong indicator of just how unpalatable the thought of traveling to the US is for Canadians today. We're traveling elsewhere - and won't be back anytime soon as we discover new places to visit. This is long term damage.",flxstr,2025-05-08T11:44:24,16
"This is going to keep happening.  There will be layoffs - baggage handlers, flight attendants, fewer Uber fares, hotel workers, food service workers in airports.  Now compound this chaos into every single sector of the American economy.  We are looking at steep inflation to pay for goods that are going to be in short supply with money we aren't earning from jobs that had to lay us off.  But, hey, look at the possible upside:  maybe in a decade or two, we will be able to get work screwing together Iphones for way less pay than we made before maga destroyed the economy.  Iphones that will cost thousands and no one will be able to afford.",rogozh1n,2025-05-08T11:30:13,10

"I’m getting married soon, and a few people have asked me where I want to go on my honeymoon - “but not the U.S., of course.” Some have never followed politics in their lives. It’s just taken for granted that no one is travelling there for pleasure anymore.",HearTheBluesACalling,2025-05-08T16:41:57,5
"Spot on.  The tariffs haven't even kicked in yet.  Tariffs on steel, lumber, aluminum, coffee,  bananas, avocados, nuts, foreign wine, foreign liquor, foreign cheese, olive oil, sugar, car parts, apparel / clothing, shoes, tv's, toys, cellphones, small appliances, other electronics, cheap furniture, etc...  EVERYTHING is going to get more expensive.  With tariffs on steel, lumber, aluminum and copper new home construction, renovation will become more expensive.  Homeowners insurance will become more expensive.  With  tariffs on steel, foreign autos, auto parts, new cars and repair / replacement costs will become more expensive.  Therefore, auto insurance will have to become more expensive.  An expense tidal wave is coming.  A lot of people won't have extra money for travel, vacations, fewer dinners out, fewer discretionary purchases.  Companies will then have to cut costs, layoff employees, etc., etc., etc.  It is going to kick off an economic downward spiral.",Normal_Attitude_5148,2025-05-08T12:18:01,5
