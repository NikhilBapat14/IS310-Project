"RFK is a 3rd party, which is a long shot in our two party system. RFK initially pissed off Democrats because he came in the Democratic primary to unseat Biden, and he has some wonky anti-vax views that, especially after COVID, don't play well with Democrats. So between those two things, he is a non-starter for most Democrats, especially now that Harris is in the race as fresh blood.   RFK ran as a Democrat and was praised by Republicans as a ""spoiler"" on the Dem side. So there's no surprise when he ditched the Dems and tried to jump centrist he gains no ground with Republicans.  RFK just frankly has little traction and ability to get his message out. National campaign rely a lot on money, political connections, ability to get into the media, and other factors that he has none of. Besides being a Kennedy, he has no strong political connections, obviously lacks the money to spread his message more, is overshadowed by Harris, and as an Independent will struggle in our FPTP system.",ProLifePanda,2024-07-30T09:45:14,1
His uncle Ted raised 100k for Kenyan scholarships and it just so happened to be that Obama's Dad received one of those scholarships. (apparently just one year before Obama was born....) That's not why he's not getting more press but it sure is a wild 'coincidence'.  My gut says he is a distraction.  Edit: changed guy to gut.,AstralNix,2024-08-02T02:38:35,1
