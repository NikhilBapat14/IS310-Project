"History:  ""Hitler determined to increase the political reliability of the courts. In 1933 he established special courts throughout Germany to try politically sensitive cases. Dissatisfied with the 'not guilty' verdicts rendered by the Supreme Court (*Reichsgericht*) in the [Reichstag Fire](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/11083/en) Trial, Hitler ordered the creation of the People's Court (*Volksgerichtshof*) in Berlin in 1934 to try treason and other important ""political cases."" Under [Roland Freisler](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/narrative/4230/en), the People's Court became part of the Nazi system of terror, condemning tens of thousands of people as ""Volk Vermin"" and thousands more to death for ""Volk Treason.""",williamgman,2025-04-25T19:17:33,6

"The government does not have much of an argument. Thy tried to paint with broad brush how just the mention of National Security gives the president presumptive authority to do as he pleases. The right to bargain was created legislatively and at that time certain departments or units within the government were excluded; those that do the actual national security work, such as the FBI etc.    >“Executive actions that are facially valid — that is, within the lawful authority of the executive — are entitled to a presumption of regularity,” they wrote.   His new order targeted dozens of agencies including health and human services that have nothing to do with national security.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T21:25:05,3
