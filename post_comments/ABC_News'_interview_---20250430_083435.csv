"How is it that leftists are allowed to brigade this sub with impunity, but conservatives aren‚Äôt even allowed to make non-political comments on front page subs?",viaCrit,2025-04-30T11:36:57,117

"They tried to make it idiot proof to see that Garcia is in fact an MS-13 gang member by adding a legend to a picture of Garcia's hand. What they failed to do is understand just how dumb so many on the left actually are.     There are threads on this site right now, laughing at Trump for presenting what they're calling a doctored tattoo. Amazing.",TheConvincingSavant,2025-04-30T09:51:50,-14
"Love how everyone understands that the 'MS13' was added above the tattoos on the guy's hand to explain what each symbol meant, now all of a sudden journalists are like ""oh that's photoshopped"".  No, it has that added in to show what each tattoo symbolises, which is clear to anyone with two brain cells to rub together.",Merax75,2025-04-30T18:25:13,3
"Reddit is totally one sided run by the left and anything that disagrees with their view they ban you from commenting. I once said a lefty who broke the law needs the book thrown at her, a figure of speech that implies if guilty than reap the full punishment by law and was accused of violence and banned for 3 days!  Yes unbelievable how they try and silence your freedom of speech even when non threatening, non violent and simply an opinion contrary to theirs this is how they operate.",MMANHB,2025-04-30T16:18:32,0

"Because reddit is 95% left/liberal.   Im banned from subs. I've never even commented in, lmao. I've been banned for reporting a commentor for trying to dox a local resident in my city's sub because he had a trump 2016 sticker on his bumper.  Edit- 3 reddits care reports lmao.",kinghawkeye8238,2025-04-30T13:31:41,105
"Because reddit openly participates in global misinformation endeavors, harbors terrorism openly, and actively participates in election interference to defraud the American people at every step.  Seriously amazed the government hasn't stepped in yet.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-30T14:05:58,18
"Because this isn't a free speech platform. This is one of the left's coveted safe spaces (albeit with hundreds of thousands of lib bots) where anything that goes against their ever changing narrative is demonized. Unlike them, we don't form patheticly massive downvote parties to ""stick it to the man,"" so to speak.   We are not the same.",DoNotTreadonMe173,2025-04-30T13:37:50,5
On top of that President Bukele even stated that Abrego is a member of MS13 and is a known murderer in the country.,caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-30T11:51:28,-3
"Marijuana mara, smiley salvatrucha, cross tre, skull se on his knuckles and the left's position is seriously that's just a total coicidence? I guess the 13 is not as obvious to people outside that world but the M and S are clear as day. They are really saying he's not MS 13 but just happened to have symbols that start with M and S on his knuckle tattoo? Total coincidence? How can anyone take these people seriously? The level of arrogance they have while being so cartoonishly wrong is also maximum cringe. Oh and yeah this ignores all the other evidence as you pointed out like two separate informants who were able to provide details to corroberate their accounts.",day25,2025-04-30T13:36:24,-11
"Trump: ‚Äúhe has M-S-1-3‚Äù tattooed on his hand‚Äù want me to show you the picture?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the picture, he did have tattoos that could be interpreted that way, I‚Äôm not an expert, lets move on to Ukraine‚Äù  Trump: ‚Äúno no Terry. He has MS13‚Äìclear as day on his knuckle. This is why people don‚Äôt believe the news‚Äù  Just watch the video. Trump spends a full 2 minutes forcibly staying on this point while the reporter said that the tattoos could be interpreted that way, but Trump needed to assert out that the MS13 was real.  Like, just take the win of the tattoos being interpreted as those letters I truly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs to gain from asserting that what looks like a microsoft word-level photoshop job is real",MazzyFo,2025-04-30T11:24:49,385
Correction:  Reddit *admins* are leftists.  It takes a shockingly small nudge to force the conversation one way on this site,MexusRex,2025-04-30T15:30:26,28
Yeah I couldn't imagine hanging out on liberal subs just so I can downvote posts.  What sad lives they have,jackiebrown1978a,2025-04-30T21:09:42,4
"Amen!!  When the left get downvoted on any issue on reddit, they lash out, furiously chastise the one who offended them, and reach for more meds to deal with the psychological impact of such an offense.  When us conservatives get downvoted on reddit, we don‚Äôt lash out, try to reason with those who got offended, lefties cant handle the truth, we laugh at it all & go have a beer and shrug it off.  You are right - we are definitely not the same!",142Ironmanagain,2025-04-30T14:03:06,-14
Because saying they ‚Äúcould be interpreted that way‚Äù is absolutely laughable and no one with an ounce of integrity would say something like that. How else do you interpret this? Even if you insist on ignoring the rest of the evidence. This is not something thats open to interpretation.,viaCrit,2025-04-30T11:34:23,-32

I don‚Äôt even think about internet points. If they were meaningful and had some correlation to the quality of the comment than maybe. But as it is it‚Äôs just who agrees with your comment maybe upvotes and the basement dwelling moms tendie chocy milk loving bridgaders all downvote it. If I cared it would mean I care what those creatures think.,chillthrowaways,2025-05-02T05:22:01,3
"So then say ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcould be interpreted as that, those symbols MEAN MS13, there is no interpretation‚Äù  Don‚Äôt then say your intern‚Äôs shit photoshop is now real, because that just further fuels people to discredit it further. Supporting your evidence with an easily discernible lie is fucking stupid.  Defending that the symbols are known gang icons is much more palatable than bullshitting about the photoshop.",MazzyFo,2025-04-30T11:37:47,189
"I also frequent medical school and residency subreddits, but frankly, why does where I spend my time on Reddit matter?  If you have a problem with the content of my comment, then approach that and formulate your own thoughts in response.  Trying to talk shit about my personal hobbies and calling direct quotes from the interview ‚Äúan AI summary‚Äù is a bottom of the barrel retort.",MazzyFo,2025-04-30T12:57:54,90
"Because the bigger issue with our country is the way our media misleads, misinforms and warps the facts surrounding current events to try to sway public opinion.  That entire habit of our mainstream media is a bigger problem than merely ""agreeing to disagree"" and moving on.  We have in our country today people who just 2 years ago thought Elon Musk was the greatest thing since sliced bread due to his advances in aerospace engineering, his superior battery technology and the fact that he made electric cars a viable alternative to ICE powered vehicle...who through the media's blatant manipulation of a single gesture taken criminally out of context, think he's an actual supporter of neoNazism.  In a society where the perpetually soft-headed and epically ignorant don't get to decide the leadership of the country, this wouldn't be an issue.  But our media know that the general public is dumber than a sack of hammers, so collectively gullible it would put toddlers to shame and credulous to the point of weapons grade naivet√©...so they spin and twist the news to help their leftist ideological brethren.  So, it becomes necessary, when they pull shit like this, to hammer the point home in the hopes that some of the drooling, cretinous masses that would normally slurp up the ""reporter's"" insinuation without question pause a moment and give it just an atom's more attention.  The fact that the mainstream media no longer controls the entire narrative is why there is a second Trump administration in the first place.",Euroranger,2025-04-30T12:51:30,-26

"I think your comments are reflective of your inability to articulate novel opinion & thoughts on subjects that YOU frequent.  I don‚Äôt need to defend my hobbies to someone who cherry picks out my engagement with medical training and physician subreddits to prove their point.
