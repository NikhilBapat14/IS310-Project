"Although I do think she would have been a good president. I do not think she should run again. We are at an impasse, and it is incredibly important to get someone to run that will win. She did not win, she would have done so much better than trump. But at the end of the day, what matters most is who stands the best chance of winning. And I am sorry, given she has loss once already, I do not think we (as in the US) can risk having her run again.   We need people who will win, period.",KazeNilrem,2025-05-10T01:15:11,2205
"> One reason Harris lost was that she failed to embrace what was sometimes popular about her own administration: investing in American jobs (the CHIPS Act, among others), capitalist-friendly pro-climate policy (the Inflation Reduction Act and aggressive agency-level regulation of pollutants); making people’s lives better and more economically stable (child tax credits and countless pandemic-era measures). Harris didn’t talk much about any of that during the campaign.  Look, I don’t think Harris should run again, but it’s abundantly clear in commentary like this that the author did not pay attention to the Harris campaign. She talked about these things *frequently* to the point where it actually seemed repetitive. It’s just that voters frankly do not give a shit about that stuff",MaizeNBlueWaffle,2025-05-10T08:52:36,2298

None of this posturing matters.  Just open primary and ACTUALLY respect the results.  Do tons and tons of televised debates among the candidates and put across all platforms available.

"If Dems don’t put forward a progressive candidate with actual progressive values they will never win another election.   Dems are fundamentally corporatists who want to return to the status quo of the Obama years. They may fight for the rights of gay people, or women, or any other marginalized community, but they are fighting for their rights to be equal within a classist system- They don’t actually want free health care and college.   They will never get any enthusiasm because they are a party at odds with itself. Bernie got enthusiasm because he was the candidate who actually stood for progressive politics and they kneecapped him for being extreme.   Their identity of “kinda progressive but not really, we’re  just not as bad as the republicans” inspires no enthusiasm. Republicans are able to get their base excited.

"Poli sci/history degree guy here and also a smalltime lobbyist. We have to accept that the lowest common denominator lower info types that decide elections in America go out of their way to vote against female presidents and that we have a sexist and racist and fascist problem in America. As much in our information spaces and political funding as in our people who always had that latent tendency. We can pretend that we are better people than that, but it’s stupidly self-destructive to do so.   The republic died in the 90s and early 2000s as campaign finance reform died and the corruption of the more heavily pro-lobbyist Republican party took over the Supreme Court to begin rubberstamping the ruthless and lawless destruction of anti-corruption laws. Lobbyists for the wealthy and corporations pulled the trigger, but voters blandly spectated the situation as uselessly as possible and continue to do so. Such a country no longer has the guardrails to stay a republic nor the understanding of the people as to the reasons for it’s very existence.

Don't start with the Kamala stuff, I'm not that invested in her, but she obviously would've been a better choice to anyone who can think critically, or think at all. Just look around. It wasn't her fault she was thrust into it because her party is complacent. It's not her fault so many Americans are have no decency, don't understand how the economy works, don't know anything about the rest of the world, don't know anything about the history of their own country, on and on...  Personally, I'd like someone who doesn't flirt with MAGA and try to relate to them and their ""economic anxiety"".

People focus too much on the president and should focus more on who they hire, voters always seem to realize this after the election when trump selects the worst of the worst... especially third party and non-voters. People have to understand that the government you need in a capitalist country is the government that is a mitigator of capitalist predation, a regulator who aspires to keep companies from exploiting and polluting. And let's be honest, the American government is going to maim and kill people. You can't change this American tradition with one election, and if you think you can put an end to it by voting for someone who can't win or not voting against a party of right wing maniacs, you're a fuckin idiot.  Two middle fingers and a big ass ""Fuck You"" to all the third-party and non-voters. You should be contrite, ashamed and silent.

And then finally, to allow an out of touch, elderly, Biden to CHOOSE Kamala as the nominee.   Like, the Dems need to understand that the process of change still requires the strongest candidate of the pack being selected by the people, not merely being installed by the ivy league panels who conduct focus groups which suffered from selection bias, just to reflect their preferred future.  Now, they may have cost the entire world everything... the climate, economic stability, national security...

That's dead we need people that will take the gloves off and go after them aggressively because that's the only thing fachists respond to.

I know that AOC is divisive, but her and Bernie are drawing huge crowds across the country, and energizing people to organize, run for things, and vote. That’s HUGE. She’s also an excellent communicator, and has a fantastic resume. If the DNC could pull its own overly inflated head out of its ass, she could be a really powerful candidate.  And every time I see or hear Mayor Pete speak, he is doing one of two things. 1) Calmly and intelligently breaking down a few complex concepts into easier to understand pieces for people to wrap their minds around, or 2) Calmly and intelligently taking down some MAGA idiot who thought it would be smart to step to him. Pete is one of the greatest communicators in the party, and at his core is a moderate who believes in 21st Century family values and a country that works for the people who keep it working, and a government to help facilitate that.  The DNC just needs to put these people forward and support them monetarily.

"I think a lot of the people arguing over Harris or whether the democrats should go more centrist or more progressive are missing the point.  There are a multitude of reasons why Harris lost in 2028, some due her campaign, some due to decisions by Biden, some due to decisions by Trump, and some due to factors outside anyone's control. But one of the major reasons is because there was a lack of primary process for selecting the candidate after Biden dropped out. Harris was the candidate that was chosen for the voters rather than by the voters. In many ways, this was a continuation of the Democratic primary in the previous two presidential cycles. Even if reality was more complicated, the perception was that the DNC chose Hillary Clinton in 2016, Biden in 2020, and Harris in 2024. One could argue that Barack Obama was the last democratic president chosen by the voters rather than the party.   If the democrats want to win the presidency in 2028, there needs to be a truly open primary, and the DNC and other party leaders need to take their thumbs off the scale. Let the potential candidates debate and let the voters choose. I think Harris could be a decent candidate to enter the primary, but she would have to prove herself.

The next Dem candidate is going to have to be capable of sitting down for a 2-3 hour  unscripted and unedited podcast and answer hard questions.  The landscape has changed.  Going on the View and answering softball questions is not going to cut it.  Chickening out of the Joe Rogan interview was the nail in her coffin.

"It's amazing how NOONE hasn't addressed the fact Kamala didn't know how to portray her own views. Everything was a laughing matter and played every political game in the book instead of getting out in front of people and speaking for herself. Even her own convention she had every popular speaker come out and came out for maybe 15-20 mins and was gone. When the spotlight is on, she didn't show up, and most of the country voted for radical change and no matter the numbers you think are showing Biden's administration was doing good, not one middle class family saw whatever numbers they tried to show. Simply put, you cannot keep funding oversea wars, funding immigrants as they come in 10 fold, and prices rising and think that administration should stay.   Everyone wants to criticize what trump has done in 100 days but seem to bat a blind eye to a government who ""does the usual political thing"" because it brings you comfort. Change is hard, no pain no gain, things will get a little worse before they get better and by the next 1200 days, I'm sure this country, who popularly voted this president, will be happy with there choice and want to continue down the road of worry about us first because without taking care of us first we are no good to the rest of the world.",Ok_Responsibility441,2025-05-10T15:41:46,1

"Let’s be honest. If Republicans win again, the oligarchic, authoritarian nature of the US government will be too deep-seated to undo within the 2030s. A large chunk of the US is sexist, homophobic and racist and they’re unlikely to change in the span of 4 years. Mark Kelly is a straight white man. He’s also an engineer, an astronaut, a veteran and a devoted public servant. He will be able to flip Arizona.   It is essential that his vice president is the Democratic governor of a swing state that Trump flipped in 2024. Josh Shapiro and Josh Stein cannot be his VPs, because of the simultaneous rise of antisemitism, the pro-Palestine movement and the overall discontent with excessive aid to Israel. Gretchen Whitmer is too friendly with Trump. His VP could be Tony Evers; he’s old, but Wisconsin has 10 electoral votes. Kelly should probably wait for Democratic winners in upcoming gubernatorial elections of swing states or and red states.   Kelly is moderate as of now, but he could make a progressive, populist turn, if he’s smart. He’s not a particularly charismatic, eloquent speaker, but Trump isn’t either. Some think that only charismatic speakers can win elections, just as they thought that a populist businessman that has never been a public servant cannot ever be POTUS.   JD Vance is probably going to be the Republican nominee; many political analysts claim he did better than Tim Walz at the debate. He is a far better orator than Trump and he is an expert at twisting words and their meaning. Kelly is as wealthy as Vance, so he cannot play the “I’m not part of the elite” card. Both of them served in the army, so Kelly doesn’t have the high ground here either.   Kelly must blame the upcoming recession on Trump and Vance; his most basic talking point must be the fact that Trump simply destroyed the American economy twice, by skyrocketing the national debt and enacting tariffs. He must also point out that many Democratic presidents, such as Obama, carried out many deportations against illegal immigrants, but not without due process; Trump’s narrative that the Dems want open borders is false and must be proven false.   Kelly must emphasize policy and give off technocratic vibes. He must embrace many of Bernie Sanders and AOC’s positions, such as single-payer universal healthcare, raising the corporate tax rate, tuition-free public college, cancellation of student debt, guaranteed family leave and limiting child care costs. When Vance inevitably accuses him of being a Marxist, communist or socialist, Kelly must highlight that Trump and Vance are socialists when it comes to the rich. Kelly must clarify that his policies are perfectly compatible with capitalism all around the world, but must also be enacted incrementally so as not to damage the US economy with abrupt changes. Supporting most policies of Bernie Sanders and AOC will attract most of their supporters. Some conservatives are aware of the damage lobbying has done to the US; Kelly must acknowledge it and impose limitations on campaign finance, the revolving door and insider trading. Kelly should teach Trump voters America’s history; Trump, Vance and Musk have ushered in another Gilded Age.   Kelly must be pro-choice, support gun control and point out that his wife survived an assassination attempt. He must acknowledge that climate change must be combated, but discourage radical policy changes regarding energy, which will impact blue-collar workers. He should also support Ukraine; data shows that millions of American conservatives actually dislike Putin’s regime.   Instead of remarking that Trump supporters are victims of his cult of personality, he must focus on Trump’s anti-truth and anti-intellectualism movement. The forthcoming Trump recession will puzzle some of his supporters that aren’t full-blown fanatics and help them see how highly educated Americans and Nobel laureates warned of this when they supported Harris. Finally, he must show Republicans that the facts indicate that *shocker* the billionaire president doesn’t work for the working class. And facts don’t care about their feelings. Cultists can hide from the truth only for so long.   The GOP portrays trans people as a dangerous minority that seeks to destroy traditional values; many believe them and the majority of humanity is not ready to accept philosophical and sociological theories about the performative nature of gender. Vance will force Kelly to pick a side in the transgender debate. Kelly must declare that there are two genders, but also say that we must respect those that suffer from the condition of gender dysphoria, those that can only live with dignity if they transition from one gender to the other. If Kelly doesn’t denounce the creation of dozens of gender identities and allow trans people to participate in sporting events only for their biological sex, he will alienate many Republicans and moderates. Unfortunately, this moral panic has become extremely important.   Many believe that the 2028 Democratic nominee should mostly appeal to left-wing Americans. But statistics don’t lie; moderates, Republicans that see Trump as a necessary evil and tens of millions of Trump supporters must be swayed, no matter how much we hate it. I know it’s hard to practically beg those that chose authoritarianism, after you’ve already begged them to see reason. However: if we believe that most of Trump supporters can’t change and can’t leave the cult, we’ve already lost.",Bubbly_Remove3703,2025-05-10T17:46:23,1

I got so many emails about donating to her, but honestly I couldn't tell you one thing she was going to change. It was very much a ""more of the same!"" campaign and that was absolutely not going to fly. And now is she repping AOC? Checking Chuck and Nancy? Working with Bernie? Pete? No. She's... telling us ""I told you so"" from her privileged position of economic freedom in the upper class. Fucckkkkk right off.   At the end of the day she just smacks of the old way. And I was incredibly suspicious that she, like Hillary and Nancy Pelosi, are 2nd wave feminists. They're happy to play the man's game and see a pantsuit as the ultimate sign of liberation. They're coming from the perspective that you need to think like a man and surround yourself with men to secure power. They're happy to be the token...

"Donald Trump ran for President for over 25 years; not just as a Republican, but as a Reform Party candidate (which failed hilariously in 2000.)  But a woman of color, who's already served as a VP, gets one shot at the golden ring and that's it.  Shut'er down.  Nothing to see here...  As Liza Featherstone actually wrote in the English language, Harris has ""emerged from her den"" like some feral animal to stalk the Democratic Party once more.  Featherstone is agahst.  She thinks - for the good of Democracy, mind you - that Harris should just fade away and be consoled by the fact that ""She \[Harris\] has better fashion sense than most politicians...""  She's weak.  She lost.  ""...many of us enjoyed her fashion sense and optimistic vibe, and hoped for the best. It seemed like maybe she could win..."" but that's all over.  Featherstone: FYI Harris is not an animal in a cave.  She is not a clothes horse who displays her wares at the Met Gala and ""...fancy parties in New York and San Francisco....""  She is an accomplished woman, a former Vice President, and one of the most amazing women to run for the office in some time.  She doesn't get a pass on any of the negative things that happened during the Biden Administration; but she DAMN well has earned another chance to prove herself in the Primaries if she so desires.  Harris has been in the crosshairs of the Trump Dictatorship since \*before\* her shocking 2020 run.  What she did - replacing a sitting President in his campaign mid-run - was nothing short of a miracle.  If she needed to get away from the limelight, the pressure, and the danger a Trump Presidency poses to her continued freedom and safety, she has every right to do so.  And if she needed time to decide if and when to re-emerge, or to attempt another run for POTUS, she has that right.  Trump, the First American Dictator, is using ICE like his own secret police to exile citizens, threatening the suspension of Habeas Corpus, and striking out at \*all\* of his perceived enemies.  And he has the power of the Presidency at his fingertips.  Harris just giving \*speeches\* exposes her to immense danger.  So as you clutch your pearls about how Fox News is ""visibly joyful"" of a Harris run, keep this in mind.  Fox news is a CONDUIT for Trump Administration employees.  They have no clean hands, and certainly no objectivity in this matter.  They should be dismissed as the quislings and weaklings they have always been.  And you should have pressed ""DELETE"" on this article the moment you wrote the words ""Kamala Harris has emerged from her den...""...  Which, if there is any justice in the world, should be your editorial epitaph.",Ceilibeag,2025-05-10T07:37:55,1
"All of the women who have run for president or are at the forefront of the Democratic Party are certainly qualified and would make good presidents — Hillary, Kamala, AOC — but to win elections you have to be strategic.  You have to understand what the swing vote is thinking because those are the votes you’re going to need to win.  The undecided voters are more confident in a male voter than a female.  It’s not a rational criterion, but that’s American voters for you.  The other problem that the Democratic Party has is that lately when they play to the center they lose the left.  The Democratic Party has always been a broad tent that doesn’t completely get along.  There has rarely ever been a lockstep unanimity within the party, with the exception of FDR and brief moments in the beginning of the Clinton and Obama eras.  The idealist arm of the Democratic Party has a tendency to let the whole country suffer if they can’t have their way.  This needs to change.  We can now see the results if we don’t do that.  Trump has already grifted $3 billion dollars in his first three months of office and is trying to destroy every institution that guarantees balance of power and fairness in this country.",muffledvoice,2025-05-10T07:41:54,1

The people who claim they “just didn’t like her” held her to standards they never applied to Trump. They tolerated his racism, misogyny, criminal indictments, fascism, and outright stupidity—but drew the line at her competence, detailed policy plans (that they never bothered to read), and a woman of color in power.  Just be fucking real: the issue wasn’t her qualifications. She was more than qualified.

"I don't know as much about US elections but I am Canadian and I do know about Canadian elections and if there is one thing of note about it is that the Liberal party of Canada is extremely good at politics. They've ruled for a large majority of Canada's history and have wiped out multiple other parties from existence before, including the main conservative opposition party before they joined together to form the current day federal conservative party, of which the Liberals just beat, again.  I think their handling of Trudeau was textbook - people say that Trump won the Canadian election for them but in truth the Liberals very much knew what they were doing. They ditched Trudeau, and made sure to have an outsider with no real ties to Trudeau or even their own name, they appealed to populist issues of the day through housing and economic woes, and Trump threats through Carney's impressive resume, they had a real contest from Trudeau, they axed his most unpopular policy that was the Conservative's main ammunition for most of the campaign on day one and then they basically never uttered the name Trudeau again, with Carney sometimes implicitly distancing and criticizing from him - he was basically left to help out with electing his successor in his riding but that was it. They stopped reacting to the conservatives and trump and started being proactive and dominating the conversation - nationbuilding, Trump, inter-provincial trade barriers, Canadian identity and nationalism, EU ties, and more, and the Conservatives were forced into reacting instead of dictating the conversation as they usually try to do - and it worked.  Again the Liberals are very, very good at politics, there's a reason they've been dominating for most of our history, they are one of the most electorally succesful progressive (ish) parties in the west. They learned from the 2024 US election, and they knew that what they needed to do was brand themselves as change from a status quo that everyone was sick of, which combined with the existential threat of Trump and pivoting to take advantage of that left the Conservatives in a bad spot, matching them in the change message and beating them by spotlighting how Trump like their leader was.  My point is that if the Democrats really want to win they are going to have to embrace change, ironically, and switch out the establishment. As in Kamala shouldn't have hugged Biden and talked about him and campaigned with him so much, Biden should have been out, full stop, as painful as it is for me to say as I really liked Biden, this is politics. Even the choice of Harris who was so close to Biden was iffy.  The world hates the out of touch political elite. They've been dropping like flies for every election against populists and the alt right since 2016. The liberals wiped that off the first chance they got and won, the Australians countered culture war stuff with populist issues, cost of living and climate and won.  If the Dems want to win they need a total pivot towards that and give America an answer to the questions of not just the dinner table but of society, of work, of the real, meaty populist issues, popular issues, the American dream, economic standard of living questions, the questions of work and money and a living, of a vision of what this should be. Trump gave an answer, an emotional, fear based, nationalistic answer and the Democrats just called people stupid and immoral for asking the question and spent their time preaching and eating cake, or talking about democracy, social issues when people really cared about cost of living, economics and the economy. The Democrats need to figure out their own answer to the Neo-liberal question of big business and dog eat dog culture that isn't just accepting it but making it nicer through re-distribution. They need a full 9 point change, and a shift back towards a message of populist, relevant change, and to take back the narrative with their own ideas, visions, issues that appeals to this core question of means of living as well as the identity of America. They need to not get roped into a both just the same or better than the other guy fight by actually believing in something and building towards something that isn't just reacting to the other guy - Again the liberals spent a lot of time being proactive and steering the conversation themselves instead of just being not-conservatives.  The final point I think is ultimately the Trump effect - The Liberals were good because the recognized the changing winds and set sail, but the winds themselves was lucky, it was Trump - He's taken the alt right answer to the times and brought it out as an experiment for the world to see and most of the world I think is beginning to realize that it's an awful idea. The Liberals capitalized on the Trump effect here, likewise for the Australian labour but critically, this was the Trump effect, not the American effect.  He is as much an existential threat within America as he is here. Nothing says that the Democrats can't politically capitalize on it too and galvanize their own support by it as well with smart politicking. They have the ammunition. Trump is a convicted felon and becoming more foolish, making more mistakes by the week, and the outrage, the anger, the rage is there, he is failing more promises by the day, including the populist ones that got him elected - and the bones of the US are still intact, people remember an America before Trump and the values it had. Trump is attacking political, legal and military checks in a terrifying way but the core of the culture of America is strong.  The question is the populist and change issue, whether the Dems can move past their politics as usual, no change habits and stop getting dragged along the neoliberal train and finally stand up for the first time since Reagan. I hope they can because the alternative is just not an option.",RomanBlue_,2025-05-10T03:26:55,0

He is incredibly articulate, well-spoken, charismatic, and funny. He can make you laugh while making a point, which is sort of a “back door” way of changing people’s opinions. He can hold an audience every bit as well as Trump, if not better  2. He is a top-tier debater. Watch any interview, but especially watch the video of him destroying Tucker Carlson. When he debates, he makes clear points that anyone can understand, and knows his topic inside and out  3. He has credibility. Everyone knows where he stands and what he’s about, even if they don’t ageee with his politics. But his politics are not party-centric; he can be just as critical of democrats as anyone else. And the work that he has done for 9/11 first responders is nothing short of remarkable. He is a man of the people, and would be coming in as an “outsider”  4.

"As someone who voted for her without question and enthusiastically (mostly due to my commitment to a functioning democracy) and tried to encourage others to do so as well, she would have been *so incredibly* low on my list among a very small list of uninspiring prominent Democrats.  She would have been destroying in a full primary race, and that would have been a good thing.  Biden did an excellent job as president overall (saying this as a progressive), but it was clear that the masses were going to vote off the price of groceries, so we definitely needed someone to bring not just distance from the administration, but fresh energy and a promise of change.  I did not support Biden in the 2020 primaries, but was comforted by his commitment not to run again in 2024.  Unfortunately, because he did such a great job, he miscalculated and thought he could go to the polls with his list of victories.  He should have understood that no matter how well he actually governed, people would not understand how inflation was not his fault and how his administration actually shepherded us through it better than just about any country on Earth.  People would not understand that he directly caused unprecedented investment in infrastructure and energy, especially renewables which will save us untold trillions in mitigation costs in the future and maybe even our continued existence as a society in the face of climate change.  That his investment in the IRS would pay dividends in the long run, entirely at the cost of large multinationals and the ultra-rich.  People would not understand that illegal immigration simply is not actually a problem—that we need labor, that immigrants commit less crimes than U.S. citizens, that unemployment is low and crime down.  I was disappointed that he didn’t understand that his mandate was only transitional and meant to break all the bullshit normalized during the Trump era.  Like RBG’s insistence not to retire, Biden’s attempt to run for reelection is proving to be the turning point of the Greek Tragedy that is democracy in the United States.",SOAR21,2025-05-10T14:35:05,1

"That's the thing. She was placed in the primary by the democratic party those in Congress, not the voters. That's another reason why voters were turned off during the election. Lots of people felt that when Biden was removed which is who they selected as their candidate for the primaries they were betrayed by the democratic party. When they put Kamala Harris in it felt like they forced a candidate in that the voters didn't vote for for the primaries. She didn't have that, Biden did. The question is would she had got that far had there been other candidates running for presidency under the democratic ticket?   Now that the democratic party forced the candidacy in 2024 it smeared Harris as someone who bypassed the voters selection of a candidate. So if she ran again the same shadow would be casted on her. Which is unfortunate. No offense to her. So I agree, they need a new candidate.  Of course many voters would select the democrat over the current, even if it came down to Harris, but it would lead to the same results and conflicted feelings amongst voters like last time. It's due to that smear above. She also tanked herself when she said she wouldn't do things differently from Biden, people remembered that and wanted change in Congress, they felt by her saying that she was just going to do the same things that left them unsatisfied then.",amiibohunter2015,2025-05-10T16:38:21,1

"Just to build off the overarching point that folks do not get the message that policies implemented by Democrats positively impact them and their social circle, even when a candidate is constantly on camera repeating that message... I would like to direct peoples' attention to Suzanne Mettler's 2019 piece ""Making What Government Does Apparent to Citizens: Policy Feedback Effects, Their Limitations, and How They Might Be Facilitated"". It starts with a framing of the Affordable Care Act not seeing immediate voter support for Democrats, despite it benefitting the broader populace, even though it was one of the rallying points in the 2018 midterms as folks wanted it to be protected. She makes the point that:  > ""Not all policies lead to the creation of supportive constituencies, and feedback effects are unlikely to occur automatically or mechanistically. Policy design and arrangements for delivery matter, as policies that make government’s role more obvious are more likely to stimulate supportive responses.""  To me, one of the most glaring versions of this was when the first COVID economic stimulus checks went out and Trump made sure to have his name prominently featured. So, you'll still hear folks talk about how Trump gave them checks while suggesting that Democrat-led policies don't have any positive impact on their lives. And even when something like the child tax credits are more likely to impact a rural voter with no post-secondary education (often a Republican voter):  > ""Those with unfavorable views of welfare, regardless of how many policies they themselves had used, were significantly more likely to hold unfavorable views of government generally, on all seven different measures I examined.""  > ""In short, positive messages about government that these individuals might have derived from social policy usage were in some instances blocked by other messages that have been dominant in political discourse and that they share with people with whom they identify.""  They suggest that prioritizing policy design that ""makes the value of the benefits more apparent to beneficiaries"" and placing that under a ""single, identifiable name"" (a la the GI Bill) would do a better job of ensuring that voters recognize the impacts of who they voted into office. The quote from the article citing aggressive agency-level regulation of pollutants is exactly the sort of unintuitive-sounding policy action that does not stick with most people, even though they benefit from it.",TubasInTheMoonlight,2025-05-10T15:07:56,1
"Harris likely fundamentally lost because of inflation (which ironically now will get worse because of Trump, and the well-documented issues the Dem party had around supporting men's issues.

And the gender issues are much more prominent in people's minds than they respected. To tell families that they may violate laws if they don't allow their own child to transition their physical form from one sex to the other through surgery and hormones is beyond reproach for so many Catholic Latino families that it struck so close to home, none of these policy initiatives mattered. Now the baby has been thrown out with the bath water, and all of Biden's whinging about our values, and all of his stochastic distance between leveraging the power of the executive branch, led us to waste so many years of potential progress toward climate issues, not to mention military preparation for potential conflict with China.

"If you're going to plan a takeover, you probably don't need to worry about the DNC itself. The DNC mostly stays out of any specific policies and primaries. They do not recruit or pick candidates for the House or Senate. That is done by the DCCC and the DSCC. The DNC basically serves as the campaign arm for the president and sets up general rules the party follows. Funding wise, the biggest chunk of their money is passed on to the state parties and lawyers to fund various lawsuits related to elections along with services like ActBlue and NGPVAN to a lesser extent.  The DCCC and the DSCC are made up of the House and Senate Democrats. They are the ones that do recruitment and spend money in primaries and general elections to get people elected to Congress.  If you really cared, you could get a major chunk of the seats on the DNC with 5000-10000 people across the country. You get your people in to the state central committees, and then they elect members to the DNC. I think with most state rules it would end up being about 4 years (next SCC elections in about 2 years, then elect DNC 2 years later at end of term).  Edit: Wanted to add this thread from DNC Chair Ken Martin that he just posted, probably after reading my comment here. He makes it clear that he is in support of primaries, and that the DNC should remain neutral. He highlights his longstanding support for this principle. https://bsky.app/profile/kenmartin.bsky.social/post/3lotfsj4ucs22",nwagers,2025-05-10T06:41:04,86

There are hundreds of Democratic Party offices locally that are in need of volunteers and candidates. You can even look up when those party offices hold officer elections and run.   If the numbers people claim online actually existed, they could walk into their local party office today, get involved, and take over by sheer participation. They could start running as Democrats on their own terms.  If these numbers were real, they could also easily outvote the current primary electorate.

"I can't agree more. The biggest issue with the Dems at the moment is the same problem the GOP has, it's become a gerontocracy and an oligarchy at the same time. The candidates they put forth and back are backed with support and money from the top. They're out of touch with the people, especially swing voters, and they don't listen to the reasons someone is a bad candidate. They keep wanting to scream sexism while burying their heads in the sand and refusing to see the real problems of the last few candidates.  Hillary had massive issues with connecting to the lower cand middle classes. Add in her strong support for the Defense of Marriage Act in the 90's and her comments about marriage was between one man and one woman still ring in the ears of many normally left sided voters. Plus we were all tired of hearing about her emails. I know that many people that didn't want 4 years of failing to get anywhere because of her emails and weekly calls for her impeachment. I wasn't surprised she didn't win, not because she was a woman but because I listened to the swing voters and they're who decide elections these days.  Biden only won because Trump 1.0 didn't work out. Just like the voters didn't want Hillary because she wouldn't get anything done and it would be weekly let's impeach her, that's how things went under Trump. By the time he ran again his base, plus the swing voters, just didn't care anymore.  Harris was seen as being shoved onto the left and as Biden 2.0. It's been historically hard for VPs to win when they run directly after the president they served with because they have to fight any negative press or issues that person hard, plus try to get ahead of their own weaknesses. Add the two together and she never had a chance. And yes, sexism could be argued, however I don't think it played as large of a role in this election. If Biden had stepped aside even six months to a year sooner I believe she would have had a far stronger chance. She would have been seen more as an incumbent and she would have personally gone through the primary. By not going through that process many people I know expressed that they didn't want to vote for her because they felt she went around the process because she knew that she had no chance of winning.  TLDR, it's not sexism that's hindered the Dems it's candidates that didn't connect to the voters for one reason or another. Most especially the swing voters.",RepresentativeEmu335,2025-05-10T12:49:54,1

"A progressive president is who Democrats want. That's not who middle America wants.   You're not winning the *election* by selecting AOC. You're winning your own heart and that of people who were already gonna vote Dem. That's literally not winning.    We need to take some centrist, independent, and soft conservative families with us in order to win the General Election. We need to grin and bear it for now with moving the entire country to sanity one step at a time. **Huge movement on the political spectrum is not realistic in the US.** Many people are ok with what is happening right now. Many. And while that is hard for Dems to believe, our party's Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z need to understand that their own POV is not what matters in the General. It's all about how are we winning that middle America blue collar family and single men. If you win that slice of the electorate, you win the presidency. You have to cater to them otherwise we might as well admit defeat now but be happy we ran a young progressive even though we lost. Win the battle just to lose the war? No. We will have failed our country even more.   It isn't ""wrong"" to stump a centrist-leaning Dem. It isn't what the country needs ultimately, I agree there. But we can only work with what we've got, and anyone who isn't a Democrat is terrified of progressive Democrats. That's a failure of the Democratic party, and I'm not sure it's accidental. We need all the old heads to go: the Schumers, the Klobuchars, etc. They are really bad at communicating.   Catering to ourselves and who WE think is the best candidate is shooting ourselves in the foot and throwing a blanket over our eyes about the political reality we actually live in in this country *as a whole*. And if we do this, we will lose AGAIN. The voters we need to win aren't down for AOC yet. To be brutal about it, we need a lot more younger generations to be born and a lot more older generations to die before someone like AOC gets elected. Time moves in one direction. I hope she will get her time. But that time is not now. It is *if you're a Democrat.* If you're a blue collar family living in Missouri, she's not your candidate at all.

When conservatives propose a female candidate the whole picture is another. For one, conservatives stick to their team, even if they don’t like it. They will go and vote. Plus, some of the left voters would vote for a female Republican president, just because she is a woman and for many, a female president is a “progressive” thing they would support, no matter the policies.  Thatcher and Merkel are both great examples of that. First women in their countries to lead government (if we exclude monarchs of course) and both conservatives.

We are also told it cannot be a *straight white male* for that is toxic.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  As for Harris, once President Biden stepped down late, there was no pragmatic option but for her to run. Were there a primary and all the ifs and buts people love to go to were not an option at the 11th hour.  And she did run it well. Was it flawless, no but she was on the same debate stage a few weeks later making her opponent spew hot garbage about cats and dogs.  The people who turned on her for the economy without a grasp of how hard it is to kickstart the economy after the world simultaneously shut down might want to check on the prices they pay today for eggs and dolls and their 401ks.  We didn't help ourselves in trying to aim for perfect and ended with a fucking monster instead. Sometime we are too arrogant for our own good. Republicans in their blind hate and ignorance easily align and voila we get the fake tanned pig back with his clown car of the worst people.  Harris will be fine in the end, we won't be.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  As for names: Pete Buttigieg would make a strong candidate.

"Replacing Biden with Harris at the last minute, then bringing in Walz, actually reinvigorated the campaign, and was probably the best possible strategy.

A season of Democratic primary infighting and tearing down the ticket *that had just beaten Trump with 80 million votes* is exactly what the Republicans wanted.    The trolls are working to astroturf their revisionist history about Harris being a terrible candidate, but enthusiasm for Harris and Walz was fucking massive, and people were on fire in a way I haven't seen since the first Obama campaign.  But all the enthusiasm in the world from the politically-engaged means nothing come election day, which is decided by low-information voters.  Our low-information voters hear about flaws and imperfections and infighting, and get indecisive or complacent or resigned.  Their low-information voters hear only sunshine about their side and woke-teachers-are-cutting-off-childrens-genitals about our side, and they vote.    Harris didn't lose because she was a bad candidate, she lost because the other side will dutifully vote for the *worst candidate possible* if he's got an ""R"" next to his name.    If there had been some amazing potential candidate on the D side who would have magically brought the entire party together in Republican-like lockstep, we would have known it.  The thing about that kind of massive popularity is that it's, you know, *popular*.  All the trolls can say is ""they should have run *someone else*"" but no one can back that up with a name.

"I agree. There is also the association people had between her and Biden. It wasn’t perfect, but me personally, I would have taken four more years of Biden if he wasn’t so old, and that’s effectively what Harris tried to promise she would do, to continue another four years of that same type of leadership. A lot of folks were willing to settle for that over a preferred candidate, because it was still better as opposed to Trump. But not enough, apparently.   In reality it still ended up being fairly close, and I think people are too quick to say Harris was a bad candidate because she lost against a guy like that. What they never want to talk about is that she barely lost. Another 150,000 votes across three states and she’d be our first woman President.   Without taking either side, I would say that anyone who strays too far from the reality that we came very close to getting that done is probably chock full of shit. Who cares why. The reasons why are different for every single goddamn person who voted. It’s either all of them or none of them at this point. Bickering over which ones sound right to us is pointless tribalism. Why don’t we just stop arguing about why Harris was bad and look for someone who we all like? Ffs. Talk about missing the forest for the trees.   Harris can run again if she wants to, I don’t care. On paper, she’s really got plenty of chops for it. Electorally and politically, she’s lost her key positioning to *really* have that chance again, but on her own face value as a candidate, she wasn’t as bad as most people make her out to be when they say they don’t want her to run again. If she works on her branding and tees herself up into another good position to launch another campaign from, I think she could still easily turn that loss into the win down the line.

"I don't doubt that racism and misogyny played a role in Harris losing, but at the same time, people who are racist and misogynist probably were not voting for the Democrats regardless at this point, so it's worthless (let alone amoral) to pander to them.  Obama won big in 2008 despite racists like Trump trying to make him out as a Muslim from Kenya. Why? Because he ran on a platform of substantial change and that energized people who otherwise didn't care about voting.  Liberals blamed misogyny and progressives when Hillary lost, but unlike Obama she didn't do anything to energize voters. She chose to run on a continuation of the economic status quo and didn't hold any rallies over the last part of her campaign.  Kamala was doing well initially. I loved the strategy of calling Trump and his cronies out for their stupid bullshit, but then Biden's staff came in to ""help"" and killed that strategy, which is when Kamala started to lose ground to Trump in the polls.

"One main reason for that is that at the end of the day, they are more about projection than governing. This is why all too often, those picked are not good at actually running things. But they are good at fear mongering, at appealing to their base, etc. There is not much substance there.  Kamala was just an unfortunate situation. Because of the timing, there wasn't a very easy way to choose anyone else. Financially one of the reasons why it worked for her is because president and vp share the same election account. So when Biden dropped out, she had access to all the election funds. Had they done it differently, we would be in uncharted waters and good chance gop would have tried to fight it.  At the end of the day democrats, although in a perfect world, care about quality of the person running. So just like when it was Clinton running, many democrats decided not to support her. Which ended up leading to her losing and the mess that came from it. Republicans are less vocal are a whole, mainly their extreme base is vocal. And because of this they will vote for their party no matter what.   This is why I've said it time after time, when pushing someone to run you have to expect that republicans will regardless of who, still vote enmasse. So it will boils down to can they get someone who will get democrats out the door (they all too often don't vote), and perhaps try and get some independents.

That being said, what Democrats need are convincing people that will FIGHT for the public. I would rather we have a diverse range of voices that all agree we need to fight what Republicans are doing with everything we have and we need to make lives better for Americans. Get rid of housing and medical anxiety for people and make sure everyone feels like they can do well in life.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-05-10T06:06:56,3
"Pandering to the middle? How many times do we need to try that before we see that it’s stupid.  Most voters are not intelligent enough to know what side they’re on, they all think they’re in the middle but in reality, most people are not in the headspace to give the correct amount of time into researching and understanding the viewpoints of the candidates and the issues themselves—so they vote for whoever seems cooler then let them tell them how to think.  And even for those who are actually middle wingers—Pandering to the medium is not good. You end up with a casserole of chocolate and bacon, a candidate with flavors that are either incompatible with each other or incompatible for the voter—so the middle takes the option that’s easier to understand. The bacon or the chocolate, even if they don’t feel like bacon that particular year, they rather have that than the combination that they don’t fully believe has the convictions or platform to sway them one way or the other.  Tell me your views, your positions, and your fervor—show it to us, a wall painted in all your own colors, when the art is genuine and the platform is strong the voter can better appreciate-understand-and support it even if it doesn’t fully conform with their values. Vs. the pandering artist—shade of blue for the cool ocean lover; shading of yellow for the lazy beach goer—shade of red for passionately passionate! How wonderfully confusing and unconvincing—how unpalatable and untrustworthy. How can a candidate win an election through pandering to views they don’t fully support? We cannot pander to the middle if we are not the middle—the left is the left, progressives are progressives. And instead of pandering to people’s views they should trust that their views are what’s best for America and convince voters to support their platform/instead of trying and failing to convince voters that they support the voters awfully halfbaked and convoluted platform.   It’s what the republicans have been doing best. Their ideas and policies are laughable—garbage—harmful even, harmful even to the voters, but yet they still get votes from them? Because they don’t work backwards in party policy. They don’t see what the voters are thinking and try and bake a cake to fit all their tastes/paint a canvas to suit all the beholders—no they have their idea of how to make America better and they convince the voter to follow that plan—and do it well unfortunately.",MrTestiggles,2025-05-10T05:27:26,1

But you seriously want to risk it again when the alternative is (*gestures broadly*) THIS?  I absolutely love AOC, I do. I'm a registered democrat that likes the cut of her jib.

Obama isnt a woman,BallsOnThisGuy,2025-05-10T02:43:10,4
Obama never made his campaign about being the first black president but Hillary made too much of her campaign about being the first female president. Not saying that was the main reason because I agree she is a shitty politician (and Obama is probably the most charismatic politician of a generation who also ran a much better campaign than Hillary). In truth there were a million different factors why Hillary (and Harris) lost and sexism was definitely one of them - although probably not the most significant factor.,Coldash27,2025-05-10T06:59:39,1

"Exactly. Yes, there’s racist and sexists but people love to act like that’s the reason she and Clinton lost, that it’s just bigots.   No, they were bad candidates. Biden won in 20 partially because he focused on the kitchen table aspect, on trying to relate to the needs of Americans. Meanwhile Kamala focused more on pointing at Trump and laughing.   As Trump was saying “are you better off now than you were four years ago?”, she was telling America that we have a strong economy and job market despite people paying more and losing jobs. The kicker is that she could’ve twisted that without bad mouthing Biden. Just a simple “yes, we’re struggling but I want to ask you this; while you’re suffering who is gaining wealth? As your employer lays people off and blames the economy, why are they reporting record profits? Why are the top billionaires supporting Trump and what do they want as a return on their investment?”  Harris and her team fucked up so hard. She came out strong but she focused so much on traditional media, barely gave interviews, and went full centrist on everything. Meanwhile Trump is doing all these podcasts while Harris is turning down every interview until the last second. ",BackgroundWindchimes,2025-05-10T02:25:09,9

"2020 was the first time since 1992 that the Democrats weren't essentially leaning on the Clinton dynasty.   92 Clinton is elected.   96 He wins in a landslide  Near 98 Gore was so popular he came to my rural school and everyone there was chanting for him to run and he wasn't even there campaigning. Its obvious by then that Hillary wants to run but she needs experience. So its clear the plan was Gore, then Hillary. Well Gore ran one of the worst campaigns ever. He distances himself from the most popular president in a generation, he does a weird rant on music censorship while being the LIBERAL candidate for president. And he loses.   Well now the Clinton's are smart enough not to run in 04. Bush was still popular by the time primaries started, we were in a war, likely not going to win.   Then in 2008 they do everything they can to elect her but the country wants Obama.   She sits by in 2012 and Obama wins again. She then runs again in 2016 and loses.   They have spent two decades trying to put the Clinton family and those around them in office. Then we run Biden four years after we should have, we win, he refuses to step down and be a one term president, he shits the bed on live television, so then we install Kamala as his replacement only for her to suffer a horrible defeat.   Ideally in 28 there is no Biden running, no Clinton running, no Obama running we're going to have a fresh start with ideally a young candidate that connects with voters.

That immediately killed any chance she had at winning.  Look at the Canadian election and how the complete opposite happened with Carney. He replaced Trudeau and understood that he had to seperate himself as much as he could from the former PM. One of the very first he did was get rid of the Carbon Tax, which was one of the biggest campaign points againt Trudeau.

"Let me give you an interesting perspective. Kamala Harris should have never done that Fox News interview. For Republicans, it must have been a very easy platform to throw jabs. For Democrats, it means major damage control. Take the Palestine issue. If you see Biden-Harris administration allowing Israel to bomb Gaza, and then you see Harris go straight to the War Hawk nest, it’s very difficult to differentiate between Republicans and Democrats on the Palestine issue because they both seem to agree on that issue. Another issue, female rights(not just reproductive rights but also voting rights and social norms). Roe v Wade is still in the minds a lot of women. Kamala Harris might seem like the ideal poster child on this, but her going on Fox News showed that is she willing to accept abortion bans as president. I won’t bother you with any more examples but you can imagine it must have been quite a gut punch for her to enshrine her moderate views so late in the campaign when people are making up their minds of who to vote for.    She’s apparently polling well for CA governor and it already looks like a trainwreck. And this is because of her close association with Gavin Newsom who started vetoing Progressive policies as the election got closer. No doubt he wanted to boost his friend Kamala’s political points. And if you compare these two to Joe Biden, no doubt Biden comes out on top. I’m surprised that Redditors dislike Biden, and my guess is because they want someone to blame for losing the election. (I tell people that primaries are essential because they test the waters early on and fix issues before they become a problem, so I always knew it was an uphill battle). And then they’ll say he should have stepped down in 2022, but that too is problematic and not straightforward, because it casts doubt on Democrat voters. But anyways, Biden made some good moves, he’d definitely be a California Progressive, not just a Texas Progressive.   But yeah Democrats still can’t get their image right and refuse to move away from being the Second Corporate Party, Republicans being the first",JollyToby0220,2025-05-10T01:03:15,0

"The standard for women in politics seems to be “walk on water, but don’t get your shoes wet.” Clinton was overqualified, but somehow her emails were a greater existential threat than nuclear codes in the hands of a man who thinks Frederick Douglass is still alive.  And with Harris, suddenly every amateur political philosopher developed a deep ethical objection to… her laugh? It’s funny how the bar for women keeps moving, while some men trip over it even when it’s on the ground.

"Clinton had a lot of things going against her. First off her and Jeb both had their names holding them back. Had either one, it would have meant that 4 out of 5 presidents spanning the last 30 years, would have had the name Bush or Clinton. I really don't think people wanted another Bush or Clinton, especially after the disastrous presidency of Bush Jr. That's why Trump was so popular that election, he represented an outsider, not your stereotypical politician.   Clinton also regardless of her qualifications, did a terrible job of campaigning. One of the biggest things being actively attacking Bernie Sanders supporters. She really didn't do much of anything to try and win Sanders supporters over after he lost. If anything she alienated them. Compare this to Obama in 2008. Clinton accused those of supporting Sanders over her of being sexist, and doing so because of that. Meanwhile Obama never accused those who supported Clinton over him in the 2008 primary of being racist. He actively won over their support without name-calling, or trying to shame them into voting for him. Ironically though Clinton did do the same thing with Obama that she did with Sanders. Accusing anyone who supported Obama over her of being sexist.",CombinationRough8699,2025-05-10T14:03:27,1
"Hilary was a bad pick too. I'm not even American, and I would have voted for her because the alternative is a monster, but her campaign was a lot of words to describe doing the exact same things the previous administration was doing. It was a bland message next to Sanders' universal healthcare. Pair that with the charisma of a pickle and the DNC elites backing her before the primaries, it alienated a small but important group of progressives that might have pushed the Dems over the finish line.  I also don't buy the sexism/racism losing Clinton or Harris the election, those type of clowns were going to vote Republican already. They ran bland, establishment candidates and received bland voter turnout. Hell, the only reason Biden won was because people really didn't want a second Trump term. If you asked people on the street who you'd want to run for president before Biden announced his bid, few would have said Joe Biden. Obama was black and absolutely demolished the election against McCain, who was probably the most likable Republican the party had in decades.  You need exciting candidates who will get people off their ass to vote.

She got way more flak for pretending she was a progressive and the dnc killing Sanders' campaign (which they did again during Harris, ruining people's trust in the dnc). People don't want the dnc to be republican lite.    You can't seriously be trying to downplay her faults by claiming everyone who criticized her were just secretly sexist, right? I hated her and I *am* a woman. I voted for her *only* to oppose Trump. Am I sexist?    I can't believe liberals are now pretending that voter suppression isn't a real issue, people are just ""lazy"" or ""spiteful"". There were voting booths closed because of literal bomb threats. Voting day is still not a national holiday and people can't miss work. Lines were hoooours long to the point of having to close and turning everyone away. Republicans have also proven they are more than willing to throw out votes or otherwise cheat to win, look at NC.    Voter suppression has always been a big problem democrats attacked, why did that change now that you need someone to hate for Trump being in power?

"Yep, “why did they not want fascist lite”.   Blew my mind they gave Collin Powell more stage time than Bernie Sanders at the end and it was Bernie that helped get Biden over the line. Then they decided that Cheney’s daughter was the answer and calling MAGA “weird” was too aggressive. One strategy barely works and the other doesn’t.   Powell lied to America to get us to go to war claiming that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Which is a lie because I suffer from the impacts of the Sarin gas we destroyed when Cheney sent us over there. The Government just last Administration publicly admitted this under the PACT Act but our unit was notified as were many others a couple years earlier. This may be what killed Biden’s son but they are vague and generalized it as contamination from the air. What is known is the air strikes (he was in those) hit the US Sarin depot and the air carried it to the “tip of the spear” where the 24th Infantry Division was and a few others. Air Force and Army had the most extensive exposure. They believe it could have transmitted back to their base and families through DNA mutations. A lot is not known about that much being released and how it will affect us. It took 25 + years to actually admit it.   So we have to make changes to the current situation and leadership. Can Jeffries or Pelosi fill a park with 35,000 in CA to hear them speak? If not then they are not the right people for this moment. Not saying Bernie is but that movement is more like MAGA than anything that the DNC has going and they hate progressives more than they hate Republicans.

Overall however, Harris underperformed compared to President Joe Biden during the 2020 election, where he received 91% of the vote from Black men and women compared to 8% for Trump.  >In particular, Trump performed better among Black men, where he received 24% support versus 9% of the vote among Black women, according to AP VoteCast.   >Latino Voters  >While Harris beat Trump among Latino voters, the former president gained significant ground with the group from 2020. Harris received 56% of the vote compared to 42% for Trump this election. Those numbers reflect a huge shift from the totals in 2020, when Biden received 63% of the Latino vote versus 35% for Trump.  >A breakdown of the vote within this demographic shows much of the shift among Latino voters toward Trump in 2024 was fueled by an increase in support among Latino men, with Harris receiving 50% of the vote compared to 47% for Trump versus 60% to 38% among Latino women.

"> Regardless of gender it would have always been a steep uphill climb.  Its arguably the opposite; *because of her gender*, they made her public enemy number one; because she had the audacity to be a career driven woman in politics. They do this to *all* women in politics on the Democrat's side of things but especially the ones that they fear will do well in national elections; the right is deathly afraid of the idea that women in leadership positions will be normalized   A key component of why the right hated Clinton so much; and thus, targeted her with so intensely with so much scrutiny over your lifetime was exactly *because* she was a woman in politics, in other words; not in addition to it.  Its a worthy reminder on this though: women have only even had the right to vote in this country for less than a century, there are still people alive who lived before women had the right to vote; in fact there are still people alive who were alive before women had the right to divorce, a bank account, to work in any field outside the home at all; and indeed it has been a steep climb for women to get into politics at all.  A good example: Montana. Montana actually elected the nation's first woman congressperson in 1916. They have never elected a second one in the 109 years since that event; although Jeannette Rankin (first woman in the congress)did win a reelection.... it was in 1940; 21 years after her first term ended.  What I am getting at here is this country has some pretty deeply engrained sexism down to a cultural level and until concerted effort is made to dismantle that; we will continue to see any attempt to make a woman president utterly fail. If the fact *Donald Trump* was seen as more qualified than a woman candidate *twice* (and we have the benefit of him having lost to Biden, so we know being a woman definitively was a contributing factor now) isn't a more in your face demonstration of how sexist this country is, I don't know what will be.",Vaperius,2025-05-10T10:17:13,1

There are hundreds of Democratic Party offices locally that are in need of volunteers and candidates.   If the numbers people claim online actually existed, they could walk into their local party office today, get involved, and take over by sheer participation.

Funny you say that and well worded. This is actually how I feel about the left. Thats why so many “old school democrats” are considered Republicans now and voted strongly for Trump.

Any progressive with a brain voted Democrat (with the exception of the Gaza issue).

Secondly, it shows that undecided, capture-able voters are not predominantly platform-based.  Centrists of course exist, but if you straddle the fence on policy you will follow your heart.  What the DNC has to generate is energy.

And yes, he has shifted right in 2025 a little by voting on some cabinet members that suck and the Laken Riley Act.  Mark Kelly is #57. Susan Collins, Republican from Maine, is #56. This puts him as the 6th most conservative voting Democrat(I'd personally say 5th because Andy Kim has far too small of a sample size for 23-24). Now yes, he is loudly and proudly anti-Trump, but when it comes to voting he's surprisingly bipartisan. Which makes sense because he's in a purple state holding a historically Republican seat.

"So you're just going to play ignorant?  Do I really have to do this?  You're overlooking a ton of nuance here.  First off, there's the 2016 election/primaries, where members of the public and voters accused the DNC of favoring Clinton over Sanders. These accusations were further fueled by leaked emails showing how some DNC officials were discussing ways to undermine the Sanders campaign.  The DNC's ""neutrality"" was also called into question during the 2020 election. The part you're overlooking here is the fact that while debates were still scheduled in both elections, the DNC drew criticism for influencing the timing and frequency of those debates, which voters saw as an effort that benefitted certain candidates over others. These concerns arose in both 2016 and 2020.  The DNC was also accused of ""narrowing the field"" by increasing polling and grassroots funding thresholds, while also excluding polls that would have helped certain candidates qualify for debates.  The DNC also has some influence over media coverage and [public perception](https://www.opendeclare.com/the-power-of-perception-how-public-opinion-shapes-political-realities/). They organize speeches, events and appearances that emphasize certain candidates and attract voters to specific issues that some candidates are more vocal about than others.  Whether you want to believe it or not, the DNC plays a role in public perception. Through debate scheduling, endorsements, media relationships, campaign resource allocation, etc...  The DNC is responsible for allocating resources like funding, staff, and strategic proposals. Which means that they can provide funding to state parties for organizing efforts and voter outreach that can indirectly benefit certain candidates over others.  Then there are endorsements from DNC members and top party officials that result in increased media attention for certain candidates.  In every recent major election, members of the DNC and party leaders played some role in helping to increase certain candidate's visibility.  The DNC can also help draw more media attention to certain candidates through its relationship with various journalists and media outlets.  And regardless of the fact that Harris was the only candidate to meet the threshold at the time, the DNC did have to adapt its nominating rules in 2024 and consolidate its support for Harris after Biden dropped out and endorsed her for the position.  Whether they're changing rules, making scheduling decisions and public statements, holding events, allocating resources, establishing relationships with the media and journalists, what have you, the DNC absolutely has an influence over these elections.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-10T18:08:09,1

"My focus was the entire economy and how it was not ""fucking amazing"", as I stated in my first comment.   Biden was not at fault for COVID. But COVID protections, which were helping millions of families stay afloat, expired before they could get back on their feet and that is Biden's fault. Failure to raise the minimum wage, failure to fight inflation and the rising cost of healthcare and living, and then insisting that we were all doing great despite that being far from reality for millions of people in this country all led to Biden voters having a negative view of him, economy-wise.  Here's [a really great article](https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/bidenomics-failure-inflation-voters/) detailing what I'm upset about. I hope you read the whole thing, but if not there are some key paragraphs.  > Summers’s argument rests on a notion of working households living hand-to-mouth who would presumably rush to the grocery (and to the bars) with any extra cash they might receive. American households no longer function that way. They have budgets, bills, bank accounts, and habits. They took Covid relief as the buffer it was meant to be, saved what they did not need at once, and drew down those savings over time.   > Pressure from voices like Summers led to an early curtailment of direct Covid relief, which fell just as prices rose. It is a shocking fact that while during Covid child poverty rates and food insecurity declined, those rates returned to pre-Covid levels when the benefits ended. Should we really be surprised that the affected families, having briefly tasted a better life for their children, were unhappy?  > As the economy began to open up again, employers needed workers. Vacancies rose. What to do? The option of raising wages (and improving working conditions) is never attractive, since the gains must be given to all workers, not merely those newly hired or rehired. The alternative is to put a squeeze on those who have left the labor force until they feel the pinch and come back, hat in hand, seeking a job. And this could be done, with the complicity of the Biden team, by letting Covid benefits expire, and by hiking interest rates. Price increases, directly boosting profits, also added to the pressure on the not-employed.",glassbellwitch,2025-05-10T12:44:41,1

">So you want some imaginary person no one knows exists? This works maybe at the state or local level but to be a world leader you need to have the name and the connections to bring enough people together to get shit done.  This is just not true. The ideal president, from a governance standpoint, sits at his or her desk, listens to their advisers, and mostly lets the government run by committee. It almost doesn't matter who it is, as long as they're not totally stupid, crazy or corrupt. The hard part is winning the election, not 'being a world leader'. If you didn't need to win the election, you could pick any random college professor in the country and probably have a top 10 all-time president.  >They did though, her name was on the ticket as the immediate successor to Biden should he step down. You do realize you vote for the VP as much as the President, right?  No, you vote for the VP about 10% as much as you vote for the President. It's a factor, but not a big one. Maybe a little bigger when the presidential candidate is so old... but still.    She shouldn't have been the successor, she probably shouldn't be the nominee in 2028 (if indeed we still have real elections), and she was certainly a less effective candidate in 2024 than any random nobody would have been, because voters were absolutely clamoring for novelty; for anything but the status quo. I'll still vote for her of course. But it'd be a strategic mistake, just like it was last time.  >Obama was a respected congressman well before his presidential run, he wasn't some dude who popped up out of no where.  Those things aren't mutually exclusive. He was a respected congressman AND some dude who popped up out of nowhere. I had never heard of him before he started running for president, and neither had anyone I knew.

I mean, seriously, are you incapable of recognizing anything as *not* being the Democrats' fault?",Shifter25,2025-05-10T12:36:16,1
"People are still screaming bloody murder over non voters who would be okay with someone running or campaigning against Harris or a local Democrat? They definitely wouldn’t have been okay with a Trump vote (which, to be clear, I also thought was dumb option)  So Harris had two options: Understand why people think Liz Cheney is on the same level and change course, or continue to do so and lose those votes.   If she thought distancing from Liz Cheney and other concessions weren’t worth it, that was a risk she took and hindsight says that was a bad calculation.",BGDutchNorris,2025-05-10T14:26:27,1

">Yeah you don’t know shit about my ethnicity. I could be an Indian or a native American or I could be Japanese. So do us a favor and quit grandstanding like a bitch.  Yeah, you're **definitely** white.   And then the racist white boy blamed the black community for this!   Oh Lord, yeah, you wouldn't have this energy in person. There'd be some problems.",ExpectedEggs,2025-05-10T02:56:54,1
"Nah. Again, that's not how the [burden of proof ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy))works (see how I engaged in good faith, and provided a direct link to that? I'll even quote it verbatim if you'd like! Because unlike OP, my link actually demonstrates what I'm claiming lol). If this is going on forever wasting everyone's time, it's on the person making a claim but refusing to provide evidence for it.  Do you feel obligated to research every unsubstantiated claim a flat earther claims? No? Then you're not being consistent.  That said, there's nothing that returns in a Google search for this. Which is why OP dishonestly was unable to provide anything substantiating it in the first place. Thanks for proving my point for me.",eiserneftaujourdhui,2025-05-10T12:08:07,1
"I did though, it didn't answer my question.  If you think I missed a part where it answers my question, demonstrating that Buttigieg was paid off, by whom, and when, then I enthusiastically invite you to quote verbatim where you think it says that. If I did miss something in that article (that you conspicuously chose not to quote previously), then you have the opportunity right here to show us all that you were correct, I was wrong, and slam the door on me factually once and for all.  I'll wait...",eiserneftaujourdhui,2025-05-10T10:11:23,2
"You refuse to speak concretely, talking instead in generalities and vague meaningless terms and refrains. Again, easy to say that you want to be perceived as moderate on election day, but you can't directly choose how you're perceived. So that's not in any way actionable. Might as well say we should nominate someone who will be more popular than their opponent on Election Day. Thanks, great idea.",fdar,2025-05-10T10:15:21,1
I see you don't know how PACs work or political corruption in general.,RThreading10,2025-05-10T10:20:17,1
I am explaining the reality of the situation. Perception is reality.  I feel those who cannot at least first acknowledge that are difficult to discuss political issues with.,cummradenut,2025-05-10T11:27:40,1
"True to form, not a single quote lol.  Figured we wouldn't get a good faith response to that ;)  Again, thanks for demonstrating my point about you FAR better than I could have on my own  😂. That said, I'm out. You've cornered yourself and demonstrated that you are not acting in good faith, and refuse to answer with honest responses. Last word is yours for any continued vague non-responses you still may have! I'm sure you value that - surely much more than you do engaging honestly! lol",eiserneftaujourdhui,2025-05-10T10:24:56,1
"No, you're not. Your repeating what *outcome* you want, and avoiding the question of how to get there.   You've admitted that being actually moderate isn't necessary or sufficient to be perceived as one, so ""be perceived as moderate (on election day)"" isn't actually advice anyone can choose to take.    Again, what do you think they should actually do to get there? How do you pick a candidate that will be perceived that way when it matters?",fdar,2025-05-10T11:48:30,1

They should obviously use rhetoric that appeals to the average voter.,cummradenut,2025-05-10T12:10:33,1
"Again, what does it mean *concretely*? What should they be talking about?",fdar,2025-05-10T12:12:31,1

"That's mostly what [Harris did](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/08/politics/kamala-harris-key-issues-dg/).  To a much greater extent than Trump, who you said was perceived as a moderate. And Harris wasn't. So it doesn't look like that approach is working very well.",fdar,2025-05-10T12:39:06,1
That’s what she did for 100 days between July and November and it came across as inauthentic. Her 2020 primary campaign + Biden’s presidency colored her campaign more than anything her team did.,cummradenut,2025-05-10T13:07:30,1
"Ok... Then doing what you said doesn't actually work right?    And... What do you think Biden should have done differently?    I won't even mention her 2020 campaign because it's ridiculous to think very many people even remembered anything Harris said then, but she was one of the most moderate candidates in that primary too.",fdar,2025-05-10T13:22:45,1
lol Harris was moderate in 2020   Alright this convo is done. You are too bluesky brained for this.,cummradenut,2025-05-10T13:35:14,1
