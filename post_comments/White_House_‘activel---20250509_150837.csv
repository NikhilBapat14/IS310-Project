To think they’ll only use it for immigration is super naive.,mr2chittles,2025-05-09T15:18:24,47

9/11 ACTUALLY felt like an attack.   All the migrants are really attacking are jobs we Amuricans won’t do.  See the difference?,TheDarkKn1ghtyKnight,2025-05-09T15:29:33,10
Not defending him but at least W had an arguably better reason due to 9/11.  Trump just hates anyone who isn't white. ,Xayton,2025-05-09T15:11:54,9

FDR was leading the country through a war declared by Congress. Not reminiscent at all.,TarheelFr06,2025-05-09T16:01:26,10
"And FDR suspended the writ of Habeus Corpus in Hawaii which laid the groundwork for removal and confiscation of selected Japanese and Japanese Americans & property on the islands to internment camps in the US interior.    So yes, reminiscent.",Imnogrinchard,2025-05-09T16:05:24,-6
Aside from the whole being attacked by a foreign military making the suspension of habeas corpus a constitutionally defensible position in one instance vs. Gollum just pulling things out of his ass in the other.,TarheelFr06,2025-05-09T16:16:39,9
A baby existing on American soil is not the same level of threat as pearl harbor.,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-09T21:22:30,-1
">Aside from the whole being attacked by a foreign military making the suspension of habeas corpus a constitutionally defensible position in one instance   Which is exactly why FDR also suspended the writ of Habeus Corpus in Alaska after Japanese forces invaded and occupied islands in that territory....  Oh wait, no the president didn't suspend Habeus Corpus there.",Imnogrinchard,2025-05-09T16:26:34,-1
"Which is exactly why FDR suspended Habeus Corpus in Alaska, right? You know, the actual territory where Japanese forces invaded and occupied.    Oh wait, Habeus Corpus wasn't suspended in that territory.  Only Hawaii where Japanese and Japanese-American owned prime real estate that business interests salivated after.",Imnogrinchard,2025-05-09T22:17:14,2
Fdr wasn't so great.,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-09T22:27:34,2
The Japanese occupied the westernmost islands of Alaska for a little over a year. They are closer to Russia than Alaska. It wasn’t the Pacific hub that Pearl Harbor was and often viewed as a diversion attempt for the Battle of Midway. It is also known as the “forgotten battle.” Moot point.,AdvantageDry7727,2025-05-10T09:28:56,0
">Fdr wasn't so great.  Correct. I get downvoted for accurately detailing FDR and his administration's reasoning for suspending Habeus Corpus (see 1980s Congressional investigation). It's hard for this sub to hear but FDR and Trump have a lot in common when it comes to immigration and vilifying ""the other"" for political gain.",Imnogrinchard,2025-05-09T22:44:29,2
It's pathetically stupid that you think I don't know any of this.,Imnogrinchard,2025-05-10T14:08:07,1
"Trump has far more in common with Herbert Hoover. He was an American businessmen, criticized for virtually every policy he instituted, actively disregarded the need for nationwide relief programs in lieu of local relief programs. Applied tariffs as a remedy to the stock market crash, essentially halting global trade. Failed to create new jobs post industrialization. Attacked protests/marches against his administration. His policies were considered mass government waste.   So you’re harping on one singular aspect of their presidencies to make a full, generalized comparison. I’m a 4th gen JA. FDR didn’t sell my family to El Salvador. Didn’t blackmail states and institutions with federal funding. Didn’t eliminate federal jobs or nationwide relief programs as perceived waste. He didn’t enrich himself and his elitist friends at the expense of taxpayers. He didn’t go on a nationwide, racist, anti-DEI witch hunt either. He didn’t look for an enemy or a scapegoat. He applied a temporary segregation during war time. My family settled in CO in early 1943 before moving back to CA after about 20 years. They had to begin again with nothing, but at least they could begin again. In contrast, the current moron is doing all the above mentioned things for permanence-sake.  At best, FDR and Trump share some sense of nepotism in their careers, but their intentions were vastly different. Hoover, on the other hand, makes Trump very predictable, despite being wildly unpredictable, which is all for show.",AdvantageDry7727,2025-05-10T10:30:58,1
