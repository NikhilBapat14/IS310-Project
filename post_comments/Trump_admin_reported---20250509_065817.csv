That's a no from me dawg,puzzical,2025-05-09T07:45:04,66
Let's see if China finally realizes that their people rely on the US. Looks like we might win this one. That's the Art of the Deal.,theboss2461,2025-05-09T06:59:53,-74

We imported over $400M of goods from China last year and only exported $143M of goods to them.,DandierChip,2025-05-09T10:33:17,48
"First of all, B not M  Secondly, us not importing from China hurts their companies more than our consumers. Chinese unemployment is skyrocketing due to these tariffs. The US is still the country China imports the most from, so even though we import more than we export, it's still significant to them.",theboss2461,2025-05-09T10:59:31,-6
"Disagree, Chinese consumers are going to be able to absorbs and withstand the hardships of these tariffs longer than American citizens.",DandierChip,2025-05-09T11:01:42,38
"It's universally understood that, in trade wars, countries that import more goods have a strong leverage advantage as tariffs more negatively affect the exporter. Chinese citizens may be able to withstand more, but they will **have to** withstand more, so that's not telling us who will win. We're tariffing 3x the goods they're tariffing, and trade makes up a larger portion of their economy than it does ours. These two factors make the pain massively disproportional for Chinese citizens.",PhilosophicallyNaive,2025-05-09T15:05:33,12
Chinese consumers don't have jobs anymore.,theboss2461,2025-05-09T11:02:26,-3
"Again, the Chinese government does not care about the pain it causes their citizens. We have midterms in a year and a half, China does not.",DandierChip,2025-05-09T15:06:37,8
And their government doesn’t care as long as it continues to inflict pain on Americans.,DandierChip,2025-05-09T11:03:03,25
They were in the middle of an economic crisis before the tariffs hit lol. The CCP was already dealing with massive civil unrest. Icing on that cake is something even the CCP doesn't want.,PhilosophicallyNaive,2025-05-09T15:09:52,8
The pain of not having cheap Chinese shit delivered to their door daily?,xterraadam,2025-05-09T12:48:09,7
"The government doesn't care, but their people do. They are being hit far harder than American consumers. We don't need to be buying disposable plastic trinkets from China. China needs us to buy them.",theboss2461,2025-05-09T11:04:23,7
I agree with the overall sentiment but their people have no power and their government will let them suffer.,DandierChip,2025-05-09T11:05:17,22
"They're getting ready to invade Taiwan. If they do that with how much the Chinese people hate the CCP then there will be a simultaneous civil war within China. The CCP doesn't care about the conditions of its people, and it's probably gonna lead to their destruction. If the CCP doesn't cave into Trump, they will collapse.",theboss2461,2025-05-09T11:06:56,1
That’s wishful thinking man imo.,DandierChip,2025-05-09T11:08:19,23
I like how you’re 100% right on all of this but heavily downvoted by shitlibs lol.,BH11B,2025-05-09T13:31:38,-1
