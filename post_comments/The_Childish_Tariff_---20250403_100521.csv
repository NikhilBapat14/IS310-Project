"""Trump said repeatedly on Wednesday that the tariffs are “reciprocal,” but that’s not true. The tariff rates announced by the Trump administration are not related to the tariff rates charged by other countries.

"We don’t produce coffee beans or bananas, yet somehow we have severe unfair trade with countries that do produce them. There is literally no sense to this other than putting a minimum 10% Trumpy Sales Tax hike on the 99% to justify the tax cuts they want to give to the 1%. We should only be calling this the Trump Sales tax. Make it simple make it known",HasswatBlockside,2025-04-03T10:27:43,3
"We Japanese are utterly confused too.  ""### “There’s absolutely no basis for it” — Agriculture Minister Eto criticizes Trump administration's 24% tariff on Japan    \*\*Minister Takaichi also criticizes the Japanese government's response: “We can’t see who is taking command.”\*\*    Japan’s Agriculture Minister has sharply criticized the Trump administration’s announcement of a 24% tariff on Japanese products, questioning, \*“Why impose a 24% tariff on Japan? There’s absolutely no basis for it.”\*    At a press conference, former President Donald Trump claimed Japan imposes an effective 46% tariff when including non-tariff barriers, and announced a policy to impose a roughly half-sized 24% tariff on Japanese imports in response.    In reaction, Agriculture Minister Taku Eto stated:    \> \*\*Taku Eto, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries:\*\*    \> “He seems to have included things like non-tariff barriers to come up with this 46% figure, but there’s absolutely no basis for it.”    Eto emphasized that unless Trump clearly explains where the ""46%"" figure comes from, Japan can't even begin to analyze the claim.    Regarding Trump's assertion that “Japan imposes a 700% tariff on rice,” Eto dismissed it, saying:    \> “Even if you calculate it logically, you don’t arrive at such a number. It’s incomprehensible.”    Amid these developments, \*\*former Minister for Economic Security Sanae Takaichi\*\*, a member of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), also voiced criticism—this time toward her own government’s handling of the situation.    \> \*\*Sanae Takaichi, Former Minister for Economic Security (LDP):\*\*    \> “No one was appointed to lead the response and immediately fly to Washington. We can’t even tell who’s taking charge of the situation. I honestly think that’s a serious issue—it’s extremely disappointing.”    Takaichi also pointed out that despite a publicized timeline for Trump’s tariff announcement, \*\*Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Muto\*\* did not visit the U.S. or negotiate with his American counterparts, suggesting Japan failed to demonstrate any real seriousness or urgency in its response.""

The base formula is tariff = country's exports - country's imports / country's imports. If that value is <10%, charge a 10% tariff. If that value is >10%, take the average of the value and 10% to get a ""discounted"" tariff.  **That's it.**",Gator1523,2025-04-03T10:55:33,2
