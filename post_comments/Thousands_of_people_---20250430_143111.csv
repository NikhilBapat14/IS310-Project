"if you want to violently force a woman to give birth, the only way you will be able to gurantee she carries it to term is by locking her up and monitoring her for 9 months.  abortion laws never reduce the number of abortions, the laws just make it inconvenient and less safe, causing more women to bleed out and die.  women in these woman hating red states should move. by any means necessary. women have stayed and fought for their rights for the past 50 years and this is where it has got us. it's time to just fucking leave.",Virbillion,2025-04-30T14:52:38,2
