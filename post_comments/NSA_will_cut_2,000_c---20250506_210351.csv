So a bunch of unemployed people who had access to the most clandestine operations secrets are now looking for work? I’d bet they’re worth double what their old salaries were to the right employers.,TSAOutreachTeam,2025-05-06T21:22:29,18

"From the article:  The National Security Agency (NSA), the U.S. government’s electronic spy agency, is looking at cutting up to 2,000 civilian jobs as part of the Trump administration’s effort to greatly reduce the federal workforce.  The NSA, which is within the Defense Department, must eliminate 8 percent of its civilian roles, or between 1,500 and 2,000 positions, by the end of the year, three people familiar with the plan told the Recorded Future News.   Reached by The Hill, NSA officials declined to comment and referred additional questions to the Pentagon, which did not immediately respond.  The NSA is primarily responsible for gathering and analyzing signals intelligence and conducting defense and offensive cybersecurity operations for the federal government. It also plays a critical role in supporting military operations.   One person told the outlet that the slashed jobs go hand in hand with the Defense Department’s goal of reducing its budget by 8 percent annually over the next five years, with cuts likely across every “combat support agency” — those that provide the Pentagon tactical-level expertise.",kootles10,2025-05-06T21:04:18,3
"Getting rid of thousands of Fed workers has minimal savings to the massive budget deficit the felon is running. No more golfing at Mara Lago, go to camp David for that. No military parades. There’s a 175 million savings that’s doable.",individualine,2025-05-06T21:25:23,2

The people being fired currently are more in charge of spying on foreign adversaries like Russia…  Trump isn’t cutting down on spying on civilians. He not only supports that but military force against them as well.,Purusha120,2025-05-07T01:15:56,4

"Cutting these people does not materially impact the budget. It does impact national security. (It's even in the name.)  All of these cuts to scientists, regulators, inspectors, are cutting government to cut government, not achieve any other result.

"You fell for the meme. Running a government isn’t like a running a household. America has been in debt since its inception. There’s been 1 year where we weren’t. Aside from that, America has been in debt for over 240 years. Almost 250.  The issue with debt is when you’re in debt to other countries and they come knocking. Over 70% of our debt is still in our country. You’re crying about a nonissue.",JewsieJay,2025-05-06T22:12:37,7

"Normally I would say it’s a great thing, but it’s really fucking bad right now. Financial outlook being what it is, I bet thousands of intelligence agents will be in need of money. I don’t believe this administration will make any efforts to stop state secrets leaking, considering…well, it being this administration.   If ever there was a time when getting rid of intellegence agents was a bad idea, now would be that time. Then again, less people to spy on us for the admin I guess?",Emilia_Violet,2025-05-06T21:40:27,8
NSA isn't spying on you. First organizations to go will probably have anything remotely related to Russia. Hope you feel safer now that you're not being spied on and that we'll be completely open to more election fuckery.,CockBrother,2025-05-06T23:08:29,1
>Talk to an economist.   Economists say that investing and growing our economy is the best way to continue to have a wealthy society.  Amateurs are the ones trying to pretend that the nation operates like a household and will be better off if we simply tighten our belts and try to be more austere.,thrawtes,2025-05-06T23:18:09,6
