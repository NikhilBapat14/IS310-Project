"Not gonna lie, didn’t see an American born Pope coming.  Given the Trump meme about being selected Pope this almost seems like parody.  No doubt the current administration will go meme happy about how this wouldn’t have happened if Trump didn’t have the rest of the world’s respect again with him as president.  Hopefully this new Pope will dispel this enthusiasm by relentlessly attacking Trump’s policies.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-08T12:57:31,62

Please do not let Vance be the one to welcome Pope Leo XIV.  The world can’t lose another progressive Pope so quickly!,Az1621,2025-05-08T12:52:40,34
The new pope seems anti-cruelty to me. He shouldn’t meet Trump until Trump makes huge policy changes.,Great_Bluejay_7389,2025-05-08T12:52:17,12
I hope the new Pope steadfastly ignores him.,snoo_spoo,2025-05-08T12:55:22,11

"Conservative diocese and local churches in Wisconsin had been pretty openly hostile to the leadership of Francis. This pope choice continues the Francis route, and this choice generally pisses off the very conservative factions within the Catholic church.",localistand,2025-05-08T13:19:50,3

Be wary that this isn't used as an excuse to allow the Catholic Church to influence the US from the Vatican.  The whole separation of church and state is not one way.  It was designed to prevent foreign influence as well as have the government picking a religion.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T13:11:01,1

It’s not really some big deal. This is a man who served almost his entire life in Peru enough so he sought citizenship there. This isn’t really a USA pope. ,High_Contact_,2025-05-08T14:07:36,11
Hearing about his profile and it seems like that’s what’s going to happen with added cherry on top being the verbal scolding spoken in Spanish.,ithinkyouresus,2025-05-08T14:17:30,2
"There’s always been a current of understanding since American dominates culture, entertainment and militarily a lot of the world they didn’t need a pope but now suddenly they decided America is in ripe need of a Pope.

"Don't get me wrong, I'm relieved that some of the worse options haven't become Pope - im cautiously optimistic because a crisis has been averted.

"In the medieval era, excommunication was a big deal.  Post reformation, if they excommunicate Trump, he can’t take catholic communion or have a catholic funeral.   Neither of those were likely to occur anyway, as Trump is not catholic.  He needs to be declared anathema.  Not just booted from The Catholic Church (Trump is, again, not a catholic) but declared directly counter to it.  His whole money makes right philosophy is so counter biblical that it wouldn’t even be a stretch, theologically.  But directly antagonizing a world superpower might be a bit more political than the church allows itself to get these days.",aradraugfea,2025-05-08T13:06:28,6

"Fair, but the new pope seems quite adamantly anti-Trump and Vance.  In a weird way, I think it actually might be a good thing.  We now have an American pope - which, on face value, screams ""ugh"" to the world - that will feel much more comfortable...and credible...continuing to speak out against what Trump is doing.  I'm a Catholic.  Though some of the Pope's past views I don't love, I'm a fan of this so far.",lap1220,2025-05-08T14:34:39,1
"Exactly. I’m Catholic. His birthplace has little to do with who he is and his papacy. Dual citizen in Peru. Speaks 5 languages. Amazing resume. I’m looking past his birthplace and focusing on all that and the fact that the Holy Spirit moves through the Cardinals and selects a Pope for the world and what we all need for the times. American roots or values, or whatever else BS people try to highlight, have nothing to do with papacy.",TrixnTim,2025-05-08T15:01:12,9

"That's a good point, and I'm certainly willing to give him space to evolve and reconsider. But until he clarifies his new positions, I'm not gonna assume that his opinion on the homosexual lifestyle and gender studies have changed. But I really hope he proves me wrong  My other two cents: criticizing public figures for past comments online, and having those critiques go viral, is one of the best ways to get said public figures to clarify their new stance, especially if they are reluctant to take a hard stance in the first place.",DisastrousRatios,2025-05-08T13:46:23,5
"Eh, that part I actually understand. If the world's goal right now is to get through to Americans and help the most ignorant among us understand the horrors the Trump regime is unleashing upon the world, an American Pope will be better at conveying that message to other Americans than a Filipino pope",DisastrousRatios,2025-05-08T13:15:21,14

"Well only 19% of Americans identify themselves as catholic, and you got to figure that a portion of those don't care what the pope has to say. Also the catholic church really doesn't have a leg to stand on when it comes to morality.
