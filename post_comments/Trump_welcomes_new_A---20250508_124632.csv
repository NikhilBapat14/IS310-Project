"Not gonna lie, didn‚Äôt see an American born Pope coming.  Given the Trump meme about being selected Pope this almost seems like parody.  No doubt the current administration will go meme happy about how this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if Trump didn‚Äôt have the rest of the world‚Äôs respect again with him as president.  Hopefully this new Pope will dispel this enthusiasm by relentlessly attacking Trump‚Äôs policies.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-08T12:57:31,62

Be wary that this isn't used as an excuse to allow the Catholic Church to influence the US from the Vatican.  The whole separation of church and state is not one way.  It was designed to prevent foreign influence as well as have the government picking a religion.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T13:11:01,1

"In the medieval era, excommunication was a big deal.  Post reformation, if they excommunicate Trump, he can‚Äôt take catholic communion or have a catholic funeral.   Neither of those were likely to occur anyway, as Trump is not catholic.  He needs to be declared anathema.  Not just booted from The Catholic Church (Trump is, again, not a catholic) but declared directly counter to it.  His whole money makes right philosophy is so counter biblical that it wouldn‚Äôt even be a stretch, theologically.  But directly antagonizing a world superpower might be a bit more political than the church allows itself to get these days.",aradraugfea,2025-05-08T13:06:28,6

"Fair, but the new pope seems quite adamantly anti-Trump and Vance.  In a weird way, I think it actually might be a good thing.

"Exactly. I‚Äôm Catholic. His birthplace has little to do with who he is and his papacy. Dual citizen in Peru. Speaks 5 languages. Amazing resume.

But until he clarifies his new positions, I'm not gonna assume that his opinion on the homosexual lifestyle and gender studies have changed.

"Well only 19% of Americans identify themselves as catholic, and you got to figure that a portion of those don't care what the pope has to say.
