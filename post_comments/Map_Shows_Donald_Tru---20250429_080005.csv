"Sitting in Michigan wondering what the fuck is wrong with my neighbors that Trump is at 55% here.     Edit - if you go to the site Newsweek is pulling from, the numbers are rather different!

I wonder if you overlay that map with an average income/per cap what it would look like. Because the states that seem to be the most satisfied are the poorest states.,Constant_Affect7774,2025-04-29T08:23:13,2

"By Martha McHardy - US News Reporter:   After 100 days in office, a detailed map of Donald Trump's approval ratings across all 50 states reveals significant regional disparities in support.  While the president continues to enjoy solid support in many conservative and rural areas, his approval is significantly lower in urban and traditionally Democratic states.
