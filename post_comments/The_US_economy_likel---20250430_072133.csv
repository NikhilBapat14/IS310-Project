"It really is amazing what a catastrophe Trump has made out of *nothing.* COVID was at least a real world problem that a lot of countries struggled to cope with.   But this time there was no event, no external pressure. Trump just decided it was time to break everything.",pervocracy,2025-04-30T08:09:35,4
Also brought to you by Donald Trump. He is the common denominator. We should all get used to “worst since Donald Trump’s previous term.”,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-30T07:47:16,3

He still refuses to see how everything isn't about money.   While money is the center of his personal universe it's sure not the center of our's.  This is why he has never had the right mentality to be president and he'll always continue to fail.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-30T07:52:54,2
"I work in real estate marketing, and I’m not sure I’ll have a job much longer. The market is virtually frozen, with nothing but price cuts. Could potentially be good for buyers eventually, but hard to say if the entire economy is about to take a major downturn. I’m at the point where I could potentially buy my first house, but my job security is very shaky right now. Shit is bleak.",Ckck96,2025-04-30T08:27:04,2

The GDP report [just dropped](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) three minutes ago.  We didn't just underperform. Outright declined by 0.3%.  EDIT: Looks like they updated the article in the OP to reflect the official numbers,gradientz,2025-04-30T07:33:59,10

"You are right. But it's easier for people to relate to and understand 2008 as a comparison because that's something that most of us have actually been through and have living memory of.    Many Gen Z'ers remember being kids and their parents suddenly having to sell their family homes, downgrade spaces and live on less to survive. They remember their parents coming home jobless, struggling to find work or having to switch schools to cheaper ones, leaving their friends behind. 2008 up-ended many peoples childhoods. And the millennials & Gen X's Etc were the young adults who had to literally work through and survive that world.    But I think 2008 will have nothing on the current coming times in terms of hardships for everyone. ",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T10:40:10,7

"A depression might be preferable at this point, if it manages to take down the monopolists and create a New Deal that helps grow the middle class again.

"Even though you were just joking around, it's still a very valid point; there are many comparisons between now and what happened in the 1920s, even down to the use of tariffs. But you are also right in that it probably won't play out quite the same way. ",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T10:53:07,2
"If Depressions took down monopolists there'd be no such thing as ""Old Money"". But the reality is that your super-rich will absolutely find a way to survive (and maybe even flourish, as has been witnessed so far- billionaire wealth has been growing) through these trying times.    If the dollar loses is value as a currency, then there's a chance that it could make American products more competitive on the world trading stage. But you're talking about becoming the next Vietnam or something here; the economic miracle that occurred in post-war America wasn't simply down to mass production and a weaker dollar but rather it had a lot to do with the post-war economies that most countries were experiencing back then and how America more precisely stimulated its economy out of that environment.    America may want to go back to the past, but other countries don't. We don't have the same problems as you and if we can find a way to create a less US dollar-focused world, we absolutely will. Most economists inside and outside of America unanimously agree that Trump's tariff plans are not going to end well and we don't want you taking us down with you, not least because we most of all didn't vote for any this.    I really don't like to sound so negative, but I don't see many silver linings to this situation.",Creative_Recover,2025-04-30T11:39:40,6
All I can say is be ready to dump a big piece of your equities to buy IBIT the instant America’s dictator announces it. America is far too corrupt to stop it. Sadly once they pump it with stolen gold they will dump it and take a 3x profit. Trumps specialty is making profits from bankruptcy by screwing the stupid little people That thought they were going to make it big.,Suitable-Ratio,2025-05-01T01:15:24,2
"Slightly less than half of Americans who got off their butts and voted didn't vote for this either (including me). Trump's ""mandate"" was a fairly narrow victory.",dumdodo,2025-04-30T20:21:42,2
