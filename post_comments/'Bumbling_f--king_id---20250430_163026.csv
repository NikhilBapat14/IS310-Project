They could be describing anyone in the administration. It’s a real Who’s Who of dumbfucks.,HenryDorsettCase47,2025-04-30T16:34:41,19

Absolutely everyone in the Trump administration is grossly incompetent.  They all are damaging their department and systems.  Imagine what 4 years will look like.,Troubled202,2025-04-30T16:41:45,8
"Trump is lazy AF. Leading through tweets is ridiculous, given his cabinet members are all syncopating morons",Responsible-Bird-470,2025-04-30T16:38:06,6
Witkoff might be a bumbling f--king idiot but he's extremely loyal to Trump and that's the only qualification for the job.  #,ksdanj,2025-04-30T16:50:31,3
It's crazy he got credit for the Hamas Isreal ceasefire by basically just asking for it to happen finally,KingThar,2025-04-30T16:38:55,2
"In true tRump fashion, Witkoff is out of his league,Putin is toying with him.",neuroG82r,2025-04-30T16:55:45,2

And most of them are in that special class known as billionaires. How in the fuck were these people able to make that much money and be that fucking stupid. I was led to believe the 1% were super duper smart,biscuitarse,2025-04-30T19:58:26,3
I still listen to a conservative podcast based in NY (and with at least one NYPost contributor) to see what they think about someone I abandoned the Republicans for but they were still willing to tolerate.   I’ve noticed over the last week or so that they are turning on Trump because his idiotic appointments and decisions have finally started to outweigh the (few) things they seem happy with.,Wise-Reference-4818,2025-04-30T17:38:52,1
"And nobody even comments that the reason that it actually went on for so long was that Trump and Netanyahu are buddies and were most likely conspiring the whole time as it was a wedge issue for Democrats. If Harris had won, there would likely have been a permanent ceasefire and Bibi in prison by now. Now, there is a ceasefire in name only and talk of turning gaza into a holiday resort..and even the West Bank is starting to be called Judea and Samaria",Allydarvel,2025-05-01T04:32:48,2
