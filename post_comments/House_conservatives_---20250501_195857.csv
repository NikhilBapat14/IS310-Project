"From the article:  A group of House conservatives is calling for significant “structural reforms” of Medicaid as part of the Republican reconciliation legislation, illustrating the seemingly intractable differences across GOP factions.  In a “Dear Colleague” letter led by Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and signed by 19 others, the lawmakers said the GOP conference must pursue “meaningful reforms” in reconciliation, including eliminating the enhanced federal matching funds for states that expanded Medicaid.   “Congress should ensure the FMAP [federal medical assistance percentage] for able-bodied adults matches everyone else,” they wrote.   Medicaid is at the center of GOP concerns as they seek to craft the “one big beautiful bill” intended to fund President Trump’s domestic agenda.  Eliminating the enhanced federal match for the Medicaid expansion population is one of the most controversial plans floated by Republicans. It would save the federal government $626 billion over a decade, according to an analysis by health policy nonprofit KFF, but it would result in millions of people losing health coverage.     A cap would save federal money, but like eliminating the enhanced match, it would mean a significant cost shift to states. It would also likely result in millions of low-income people losing coverage if states cut benefits to make up the spending difference.",kootles10,2025-05-01T19:59:23,6
