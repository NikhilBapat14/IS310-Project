Yeah.  That is not a thing and it makes you unfit to be Sec of State to promulgate this line of strange and unhinged thought.  It is not going to happen.  You look like a fool.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-28T13:07:19,26

The narrative that having a trade deficit it to be treated unfairly is the fallacy at the center of all this.  Commerce doesn't have to be equal from both sides to be economically advantageous.    Back when Republicans believed in anything other than Trump they would have told you that the invisible hand of the market creates efficiencies in complex systems.,Searchlights,2025-04-28T13:09:33,3

"( in case of Paywall Pain, here's the text)  As Canadians prepare to vote for prime minister in an election where President Donald Trump looms large, Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated the president's desire to make Canada a U.S. state.  ""They'll have their elections this week,"" Rubio said about Canada on NBC's ""Meet the Press"". ""They're going to have a new leader, and we'll deal with a new leadership of Canada. There are many things we work with cooperatively on Canada on, but we actually don't like the way they treated us when it comes to trade.""  Pressed by ""Meet the Press"" host Kristen Welker whether Trump still wants to make Canada part of the United States, Rubio responded: ""I think the president has stated repeatedly he thinks Canada would be better off as a state. I mean, he has said that based on what he was told by the previous prime minister, who said Canada can't survive unless it treats the U.S. unfairly in trade.""   Trump began pressuring Canada on trade issues before taking office and repeatedly said the country should become a new U.S. state. He recently told Time magazine that he's serious about Canada becoming part of the United States.  ""I'm really not trolling,"" Trump told Time. ""Canada is an interesting case."" He complained about the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and said the United States doesn’t need Canadian products.   ""And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state,"" he added.  Trump's comments are roiling Canadian politics ahead of the April 28 vote for prime minister. The Liberal Party was trailing in polling when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in January that he would resign. A person reacts as Canadians hold an ""Elbows Up"" protest against U.S. tariffs and other policies by U.S. President Donald Trump, at Nathan Phillips Square in Toronto, Ontario, Canada March 22, 2025.  But the latest CBC polling average shows Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney with a slight edge in the race over Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre. Trump's trade policies and comments about becoming a U.S. state provoked a backlash in Canada and have become a major issue in the race for prime minister.",timetogetoutside100,2025-04-28T13:07:51,2

"They're fascists and Canada is nearby. That's it.  I sure hope Trump's political opponents are actually moving to stop this, because he isn't. Nip this in the bud by making it eminently clear that he'll have a revolution and a mutiny on his hands if he tries to do this. They're cowards; they'll back down if they think there will be consequences for them personally. It's not as if democracy in the USA is going to survive  anyway if these people are allowed to start a war.",barryvm,2025-04-28T13:15:58,11

Not MAGA but here is my take.   He is deflecting from the total shit show his economy is becoming and his fascist bs.    Fox talks about this instead of the fact that there won’t be any toys to buy for Christmas or arresting a judge.   Plus he thinks it makes him look strong with his base.,TubeframeMR2,2025-04-28T13:14:23,9
Imperial expansion is a key part of fascism. It's necessary to provide a rallying cry for the population and to make Trump seem like a great leader who's tried to expand the country. It's like Mussolini with Ethiopia and Hitler with Austria and whatnot.,Scarlettail,2025-04-28T13:30:05,3
"Just Trump's yes-men sucking up to him.  Trump said it then all his underlings need to say it or they'd get fired.

Spending per capita, Canadians are buying 10x more from us than we are from them.""  They will be out the door as soon as Trump hears about it.",White_Meteor,2025-04-28T14:08:01,1
"Canada is currently the fourth largest oil producing nation in the world. Combining Canada’s oil production with the US’s would give the US control of nearly a quarter of all oil production. OPEC collectively would still control more oil production but they would likely hold less leverage if the US was producing that much oil. Even without the geopolitical implications of that much oil production centralized under a single state, there is just the simple fact that Trump has a strange obsession with “liquid gold”",dannyb_prodigy,2025-04-28T22:03:25,1

"He was talking about it before the shit show of an economy. It was actually something he brought up days before being sworn into office. I don't this is some 4-D chess, he's just a moron, likely in the earliest stages of dementia, who is just fixated on Canada as the 51st state.  Rubio and co. play along because Trump will just blindly sign off on whatever Heritage Foundation backed E.O. they put before him. Rubio isn't serious, Trump is basically a giant toddler and them playing along with the Canada thing is their equivalent of,  ""Yay! You're such a big boy.""",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-28T13:32:56,6
