"What a surprise. A guy helps wage a coup for a dictator, and when in power that dictator rewards the traitor with a fat payout.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-02T16:40:16,18
That’s an odd way to spell “traitorous cur” but sure.,chemicallyaware,2025-05-02T16:46:22,13
What exactly is the payout for? She illegally trespassed. When the cops warned her to back off she didn't. Any other scenario this would not happen.,Fairymask,2025-05-02T16:54:06,10
"So by this logic anyone shot by cops deserves money and this is precedent. To be safe, perhaps police shouldn't have guns. ",thistimelineisweird,2025-05-02T16:54:16,4
Absolute BS.   She tried to overthrow the election.,TintedApostle,2025-05-02T17:05:13,5
I can't believe they are going to pay out.  I mean with Trump sure but the rest of the system?  What a timeline to live on.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T16:40:08,3
The family should get a bill for the damages she did to the building and for the bullet.,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-02T17:49:54,3
With taxpayer money I presume? ,Late-Dingo-8567,2025-05-02T18:06:18,3
No but if they refund the restitution and actually pay the rioters I’m storming the capitol about it,Untitled-Original,2025-05-02T16:53:53,2

"Man, if only she recieved some sort of warning this could have been avoided.  /s",the_comatorium,2025-05-02T16:58:59,1
Isn’t she de@d?,Ridicutarded-73,2025-05-02T17:22:19,1
isnt that the dead woman.. did they use a psychic?,Strict-Pain5154,2025-05-02T18:04:43,1
"How do you reach a 'settlement in principle' or any other way, with someone who is dead?",AINonsense,2025-05-02T18:36:22,1
Is it revoke her military death benefits and strip her of any military honors or awards she has? Cause that seems reasonable to me,NeanaOption,2025-05-03T10:55:35,1
I mean I get Trump  But the rest of the system is going to go along with it?,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T16:41:54,5
We can just make it simple and call them “terrorist” in my opinion. Trump’s voters probably don’t know what a cur is anyways,Wizley15,2025-05-02T16:55:40,6
Can't argue with that.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T16:50:14,1
The payoff is to not have a trial where her defense would be that she was there at the invitation and insistence of the president.,schu4KSU,2025-05-02T17:32:38,3
"1000s of people were watching the livestreams that day and saw her charge the fucking door when they told her repeatedly not to. Officers / guards warned her multiple times that she would be shot if she attempted to breach the door, and she was shot. You can't forget seeing something like that. If she had breached the door, dozens of Congresspeople could have died and the rioters may have won. Someone could argue that shot saved the entire country, for 4 years anyway.",Asleep-Sale-2457,2025-05-02T19:27:30,2
They sure as anything are not going to give them their own money.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T18:34:01,1
"When she ignored orders from the secret service yep.   When someone points a gun at you and says stop, its a good idea to stop.",wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T17:39:26,5
Nope they are giving it to her parents,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T18:33:02,1
With the dead woman's parents.   They sued the government and Trump has decided the US is going to agree to pay them damages for their idiot traitor of a child getting themselves killed.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T18:39:48,1
She was only in 14 years counting the guard.  I don't think she had any benefits as she was a civilian when she got herself killed.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-03T11:50:37,1
Why do you think this would be the thing that would cross the line? This is messed up but it's far from the worst he's done in terms of grift and corruption.,thrawtes,2025-05-02T17:13:19,2
caption says rioter. not parents..,Strict-Pain5154,2025-05-02T23:41:37,1
"They could fork over the value of Fort Knox. She can't accept, reject, praise, or deride it. Either way, it will still do squit for her.  And, the woman fought her way to a bullet. Whatever 'settlement' they make, the taxpayer ought to have a way to recover it from Bottle Blondi and PoopyPants.",AINonsense,2025-05-02T20:59:45,1
I didn't think it would be some thing that crosses the line.  Just cant believe that someone that was leading a mob trying to capture members of congress rates a payout when their criminal actions get them killed.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-05-02T17:42:01,3
