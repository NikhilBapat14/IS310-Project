They set the rules for their primary to ensure that there was more socioeconomic and racial diversity in the early primary period; the NHDP had and has ample opportunity to ensure that their delegates get counted. The NHDP is actively campaigning against doing so.   These rule changes were voted on by DNC membership and overwhelmingly approved.  Nothing corrupt about it. Political parties are free to set their own rules and guidelines because they’re private institutions.,S-Seaborn,2023-08-01T22:13:34,15

"First, as others have said, the primary/caucus is done by the DNC, which is a private organization and generally not held to the same standards as a normal election. Many states just outright cancel their primaries if their incumbent is running again.  Second, I cannot find any source validating what RFK Jr. here is saying. It's possible he's misinterpreting or missing context on some DNC rule changes, namely that they want NH to make voting easier and no longer be the first primary state. But given RFK Jr. history with statements, and the fact I can't find anything to validate this claim, I'd wait for confirmation or some proof before taking it seriously.",ProLifePanda,2023-08-02T08:01:48,8
"NH can't keep his name off the ballot in Georgia. I'm not sure what he's referring to about NH, you can't really take what any person says second hand as fact especially if they don't offer up where they got that info.   Secondly, what does 'campaign' mean? That's a vague word in this case. Do some fact finding and don't trust what a guy who thinks viral disease isn't a threat to human life says on a podcast.  This is the only thing I could find with a quick Google and it doesn't suggest what he's saying.   https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-move-strip-new-hampshire-first-nation-primary-after-day-long-discussion",SirTiffAlot,2023-08-02T01:44:57,6

"The first two states in the primary were NH and Iowa, and their demographics are way off.  They don’t reflect the Dem party, so the Dem party put forth more diverse states to start primary season with!   NH is jealous that SC is going to get more attention.",TenaciousVeee,2023-09-19T23:19:37,1
