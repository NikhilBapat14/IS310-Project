TLDR: They applaud a bunch of useless shit and then disapproved of a bunch of horrible shit and split the difference on Gaza (against Israel) and Ukraine (for ending aid.)  Added up to a C-.  /thread,FawningDeer37,2025-05-06T21:29:47,29

“I have always found it quaint and rather touching that there is a movement [Libertarians] in the US that thinks Americans are not yet selfish enough.”  ~Christopher Hitchens,direwolf71,2025-05-06T22:06:45,10
"Well, let’s see. Nope, you’re still not allowed to sell your children to an unregulated coal mine in exchange for bitcoin so you can buy sex workers and crack.  No surprise, the libertarians are still going to bitch. Even if you gave them all that, they’d still complain that they saw a firefighter putting out a fire in a public playground, rather than having a private fire response team for the playgrounds built exclusively by private communities.

">There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: *The Lord of the Rings* and *Atlas Shrugged.* One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.  \-John Rogers",gfh110,2025-05-06T23:24:27,9

"I'm not sure you can call them anarchists, to be honest. Anarchism opposes capitalism because it sees the regimentation of society in service of capital as just that: a form of hierarchy that leads to oppression. Libertarians oppose government but revere capitalism. In practice, they don't seem to want to flatten social hierarchies, but rather to remove the state so they can construct new ones with them at the top.  Without the idea of an equal society it can't be anarchism, and if you expand the definition of libertarianism to also include those moderates who don't want to cripple or destroy the state in order to replace it with private hierarchies then there's no difference between them and classical liberals.",barryvm,2025-05-07T02:00:27,2
