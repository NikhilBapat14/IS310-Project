"How many showers does it take to get all of the poo off their faces after hours of such brown-nosing? Even with the new executive-order required high power showers, the cabinet members must have had to take the afternoon off after this sh-show.",mbw70,2025-05-01T09:10:11,31

"These people have zero self worth, what are they gonna do when this circus ends? Likely jump onto the next fat, old, corrupt, soft, weak, sensitive, micro dick energy having piece of trash that roles up in this party. Democrats have a lotta issues and need to really refigure their approach, but at least we aren‚Äôt willing participants to our own degradation. FUCK MAGA and the bottom bitch behavior you came in on.  See y‚Äôall in 2028!",ReturningRelavent,2025-05-01T09:25:58,13
She's one to talk. All of DT's goons are incompetently corrupt or just flat out feckless cretins.,Viking_Musicologist,2025-05-01T09:20:45,10
"‚ÄúRemember Pam, say the line EXACTLY as we told you. Be sure to say thank you at the end. You absolutely MUST thank President Trump and bask in his supreme glory for all to see.  Do it Pam, or you will be cast aside. I guarantee it.‚Äù  -Most likely a real email in Pam‚Äôs inbox right now. Probably.",PrettyAdagio4210,2025-05-01T09:38:07,8

I get the worst second hand embarrassment from watching these sycophants tell Donnie what a good little boy he is. ü§¶,5adieKat87,2025-05-01T13:36:21,3
It boggles my mind there are people who are perfectly fine kissing-a\*s so... unashamedly.  Evil people truly have no shame.,KitKitsAreBest,2025-05-02T13:44:13,2

Bad day in the media? Get the Cabinet together to kiss his ass for an hour or two. Pass out hats. Compete for most outlandish unprovable claim.,Gatsby520,2025-05-01T14:17:21,1
"Every time I see one of these, I think of that Harry Potter scene where Voldemort and his most devoted pureblood lackeys are sitting at a long table, cackling about all the shit they've done and then killing a schoolteacher.",ThatsNotMyName222,2025-05-01T14:18:40,1
"He won't even succeed in setting up a dictatorship, which means he's failing in every aspect. If someone wishes for him to become a dictator, I can understand how an ignorant person might think he's doing great. However, the reality is that he's being thwarted or hindered with each attempt to seize power. His quest for dictatorship is destined to fail, and we'll be the ones left to deal with the mess he leaves behind.",sms3eb,2025-05-01T16:18:22,1
