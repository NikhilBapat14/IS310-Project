i would love to see Gretchen Whitmer being the democratic nominee in 2028 with Mark Kelly as VP. Swing states and an open primary will be better for the democrats. To me a wire to wire front runner isnt good. We need someone who is essentially a dark horse come out of nowhere and take the nomination. 76 no one knew who Jimmy Carter was and look what happen. Bill Clinton also a dark horse in 92. Hillary clinton who had been in the national eye for years was supposed to be the nominee in 2008 and here comes Barack Obama (someone who had only been in the senate or 4 years) out of left field winning the presidential nomination. the problem democrats have is they were not interesting enough last election. who can become the dark horse superstar that the democrats need.,Routine-Dirt9634,2025-03-25T02:43:06,14

Already has an impressive political career.  **Don Davis:** U.S. Rep for North Carolina, former Air Force, just won a very closely contested race.      **Well Known Democrats:**   **Mark Kelly:** Arizona Senator, good name recognition, from a swing state, relatively young, is an astronaut.   **Tim Walz:** Minnesota Governor, has name recognition from previous VP run.        **What I think we need:**   1. Someone relatively young, no more geriatrics.   2. Someone with a ""boring"" political career. Nothing to crazy or controversial. I did pick some more progressive choices on my list.   3.

"From the new Vox analysis of why Dems lost, it has to be someone who can speak to zoomers and 18-29 year old voters, AND minority moderates of all ages.

"Jon Stewart. Sarah Silverman. Bill Burr. Some unapologetic comedian or entertainer with absolutely zero political experience whatsoever. Would they make the best president? Maybe not (though all of the people I mentioned have good intentions, IMO).  But at this point I'm convinced that the Democrats needs a *complete* outsider to reboot the party's image. Someone needs to stage a hostile takeover of the party backed by aggrieved primary voters. It's the only chance the Dems have to not continually be seen as the party of feckless, insider politician stooges.  Plus, guys like Burr in particular are clearly left-of-center but don't have a perceptibly ""woke"" bone in his body.

"No one of the categories you mentioned would support Tim Walz. Pete would do better than Tim, but I agree that neither of them could win. I also believe that anyone who falls for socialism or social justice would also lose.  You need someone who is going to be rule of law and also pro-borders. If you don’t have that, you are going to have a hard time on the campaign.  This also means it has to be someone who is active and actually voting and talking that way now.  John Fetterman would be the most likely and across-the-aisle candidate.  He has been the most vocal about getting back to a platform that most Americans could rally around.  The worse part is that a lot of people hate him for it.

">in my mind if the more moderate democrats split from the far left they'll attract a lot of people who voted for Trump as the ""less bad"" option at the time.  This is a fantasy, though. The dems tried to run a moderate campaign in 24, they recruited prominent Republicans to campaign with, bent their immigration platform to essentially align with Trump, and Harris didn't mention trans people at all except in 1 pretty ""both-sidesy"" comment. And after all of that, Harris actually LOST more never Trump Republicans than Biden or Clinton did. Trump also lost votes from 20 to 24, so it's not like he was somehow more popular. A lot of dem voters were pissed (Gaza, lack of action on Healthcare/biden's domestic agenda, etc.) and the party basically abandoned its base voters. Basically, exactly what you're calling for, and they lost. The name of the game now is activating the 50+% of non voters. That's what Trump did in 2016, and he did it with a platform that spoke to the Republican base (immigrants are evil and cause all of our problems in that case).",Zadow,2025-03-25T19:41:25,4

"I think that this take is valid, however it’s missing some of the key points on why some people are homophobic, especially in rural areas.  I grew up in a very red area of my state and saw first hand and heard first hand why people disapproved of the mainstream LGBT movement. It wasn’t necessarily the fact these people were homosexual, rather that people felt the movement was forcing homosexuality into the lives of people who didn’t want to see it. People didn’t care if you were gay or lesbian or etc., they just didn’t want to associate the topic of sex with a person every time they saw them. People disliked that members of the LGBT community were very expressive and were trying to promote their rights, and felt that members were trying to “convert” there children to being gay. Homophobic people often see being gay as a choice, and simply don’t want to see their children make that choice. They may not mind if other people make the choice to love another person of the same sex, but many conservatives pride themselves on family heritage and bloodlines, and if a person marries another man/woman, they may not have bio children.  That being said, I think Pete can avoid this. From what I’ve heard whenever I go back home or talk with some of my friends that are more conservative, they somewhat like Pete. They like the fact that he doesn’t “Force his sexuality into your face”. Basically they’re saying they like more closeted gay people. Pete has done a great job at appeasing homophobes by keeping his appearances on television very focused on topics away from the fact he is gay. He hasn’t made any large appearances at rallies, he doesn’t speak much on LGBT issues, and if you do a quick scroll through his Instagram (heavily used by older people now), you can only find 1 post that has the LGBT flag. That post is from 5 years ago. Pete doesn’t appear as your “typical gay man” to homophobic people, and they like that.  Now ultimately, yes, Pete being gay does give him a huge impediment for running in 2028, however he can overcome it. Most conservatives say the line “I’d rather vote for a gay guy than a woman” and we’ve now seen this happen in 2016 and 2024. We had thought in the 21st century that America would be more racist that misogynist, but we’ve been proven wrong on that front. In my personal opinion, America is still more misogynist than it is homophobic, and I had that belief even before this past election to help solidify that. If the Democratic Party puts forward another female candidate in 2028 or possibly even 2032, it will lose. Point blank and simple. Now is the time to see if America is ready for a gay president though. Pete is the perfect person to test that. He fits everything else conservatives can like about a democrat. He’s a white male that makes very professional appearances, and appears to be a moderate.  Pete in my opinion is the best choice for democrats in 2028 and at this current moment I would vote for him against many of the republican front runners for 2028 if I lived in a battleground.

That's the minimum, THEN we can make the case for healthcare as a human right, getting the rich to contribute more fairly, etc... the loudest voices in the far left are killing the party because nobody challenges them and just acts like they don't disagree because they'll get crucified for not being politically correct even though they are still 100% advocating for liberal policy.",Anomalous-33,2025-03-25T19:47:16,-1

It is not the American citizen's fault we can't have a more progressive candidate--it's the DNC's fault. They don't give a platform to anyone who deviates from the status quo because the status quo serves them.

Both sides seem to struggle with acknowledging that our government is going to be bipartisan, and to get the strongest overarching votes, we need to be able to acknowledge both sides and their concerns.   One thing that made Bernie's so appealing was because he also could take votes from trump. That was mostly off of policy not popularity. If you can appeal to both sides through policy, you can let social media influencers do the rest of the work.",marvelescent,2025-03-25T11:48:02,-2

I thought she was pretty charismatic, but I did find her coming off as following what she was told vs bringing something new. A leader you can tell us prepared to uphold the status quo and not ruffle feathers isn't very inspiring to a lot of progressives, and they definitely suffer again Trump, whose party believes he's bold and unafraid for their party.",marvelescent,2025-03-26T01:53:00,0

I think she was charismatic, but it's more so that she had to run on a base of more honesty and fact-driven things, when lies and fear travel faster than truth. So even though she likely could have won against any other Republican candidate, Trump's following was already too strong in the first place. And the fear and prejudice that was generated was just too much to overcome. Her policy wasn't strong enough to break through the smoke screen that was created on the opposition. I get what you're saying though. I just don't think the elections were always simply a popularity contest. I think there was a time where policy meant more.",marvelescent,2025-03-26T07:34:48,1
">24 was NOT moderate.  I can only assume ignorance on this take. I've been a registered Democrat for over 10 years, and I have no idea where you're getting this idea. Maybe you can point to a specific part of Harris' campaign that seemed ""radically left""?  >the reality is that to beat Conservatives either the Democrat party needs to stop with the transgender stuff, acknowledge that a lot of fraud/waste was going on and should be fixed + prevented in the future, and unequivocally disavow any form of violence/destruction in protests or split up into 2 parties who disagree on those issues.  So democrats need to become Republicans? I'm sorry this is just very funny as a Democrat who's seen the democrats run this playbook over and over. Most dem voters support trans people. If you're going to try and outflank Republicans on trans issues, it's not going to happen. If people buy the ""trans are evil and pedos"" line, they're going to vote Republican no matter what. Also the whole ""trans issue"" is just another culture war moral panic created by the right. Seriously, 80% of trans content out there comes from the right. They can't get enough of it because it's an easy target to pacify their voters with hate.  Your point about ""disavowing violence"" is also very funny because Republicans in the Trump cult have been supporting the Jan 6 rioters for years with no real electoral consequences, so I don't really see the basis for that claim either.  The important thing to remember in all of this is Trump didn't gain any votes in 24. It's not like he won over new supporters. People just weren't moved to vote for a continuation of the status quo.

But not to the extent that the democrats (and well , the people on this tread) seem to believe. And the small percentage of people who are like that are not only from southern rural white america. And with list of candidates you guys are considering and the reasons that you float for recent failure in the most recent election…. I have to say, you people never learn. Middle of the road moderates, independents, and “low information”(😂smug much) voters.  Didn’t vote for Kamala because of misogyny or racism. Or because they were brainwashed by Trump. Or because of the price of eggs(well a little bit by the price of eggs). But she was a bad candidate. She was part of a horrible administration, and she wouldn’t or couldn’t ever specifically say what she would do differently. But yet all you guys take away from it is that rural Americans are dumb and racist. I mean that’s fine with me, but I’m not particularly interested in an all conservative government either….so please for the love of God. Think about this…open borders is not a good policy. Think what you want about open borders but that is going to lose you another election before a gay man or a woman will. So my advice is to change course on that policy. Also, be gay be trans, be whatever you want to be but not till you are at least 18 maybe 21. So stop advocating for puberty blockers and transitions for minors and stop advocating  high school boys playing sports against girls. Like seriously…change course right there and if you put up a good candidate, you will win PS(don’t know why I am giving you this intel,but ) AOC is liability.

"I fully agree that yes, Republicans and the current administration/right wing media will try and tear him apart and attempt to make him look as bad as possible, however in the election it’s not Republicans you’re trying to win over, it’s moderates/undecided voters. We saw this happen with Trump this past election where left wing media and democrats tried to lose Trump as a traitor, evil, a Russian spy, a threat to democracy, a sexist, a racist, and numerous other things, yet he still won the election. Many if not all of the things they said about him were true, yet Trump was elected.   The left wing media said all those things and yet Trump harnessed it, reworked it, and reflected it to the new voting bloc of young males. He created a whole new voting bloc that hadn’t played a huge role in elections prior. A very large question that people aren’t asking is: Will young males be a consistent bloc now? Or was this a one off event that occurred because of Trump? If it is the former, Democrats need to start working now to get Masculinity back into their party. It’s a sad thing to think about that they’ve worked so hard the last few decades to promote Women’s equality, and now may have to toss it aside. But the moderate voter now has shifted more to lean conservative than to the left due to this new bloc of voters Trump created.  Democrats need to appeal to young men, and using a young man like Pete can help aid that. The benefit (and drawback) to Pete over other young figureheads of the party is the very fact that he is gay. I say that this is a benefit in some way because it’s a pseudo guarantee to the left that even though the Democratic Party may need to shift more towards masculinity and and abandoning women running for president for some time, they are still holding true to their beliefs of equality and representation for all.

I spent all of my life until recently as a republican, so a lot of the things that you say, just aren’t going to apply to me.   I don’t care for open borders, for example. I don’t talk down about the area. I was literally born and raised in and still live in.  Honestly, right now, it’s too tough to say what reliable candidates there might be.

I looked around and I didn’t see any candidates whatsoever that I thought were worthwhile, and I could not possibly see how the Republicans could ever be Democrats.   Funny, how time changes, right?   But in the same way, Donald Trump basically just came out of nowhere to where he is now within the Republican Party, perhaps holding out hope that something similar could happen for the Democrats.   Because for me, some of the big names, I just don’t think we’ll have a good chance of winning.

To be a good communicator you are able to get across clear goals and vision without struggle and Pete is just not doing that. He gives a series of platitudes without specific action calls and that’s a huge issue that the Democrats have consistently had since Obama left in 2016.  I also disagree on Bernie getting crushed as he performs very well with the same base as Trump and there is evidence a not insignificant amount of them would have voted for Bernie but since he wasn’t on the ballot they voted for Trump.

"Oh boy it’s a mix of social, emotional/personal, and even historical reasons. I don’t see how I can describe ALL of it efficiently. I’ll start with how I was simply raised. I was raised “capitalist” without my parents knowingly or purposefully raising me capitalist. They always taught me I have to work hard and earn my path to success. I was always told nobody “the government” included, will not give me a helping hand. It doesn’t help that I was also raised that being black is difficult on top of that. Therefore my parents always pressed me to have good grades. Even though I unfortunately didn’t take them seriously until AFTER high school, I really understand what they were telling me now. It’s semi too late. Fortunately but unfortunately I haven’t went to college yet. But I’m trying to. And even though I’m struggling to do so I still believe in hard work and merit. I’m very upset yet understanding that I don’t meet requirements to rent my own apartment. I keep getting turned down. Yet I’m not some ridiculous socialist that blames the government and capitalism for all of my problems. I take accountability for my own irresponsibility and failures why I can’t rent an apartment to move to for college. And that’s a strength rather than a weakness. If I were weak, I’d be another young black man blaming racism and social injustice for my experience. However in reality I haven’t put in enough effort to achieve my goals. I’m far from a well off individual yet I don’t blame other people, especially rich people, for my own struggles and inept decisions like socialists do.   Also, my historical reasoning. I’m a history buff that favors history between the First Crusade up to 1945. In 8th grade I became a patriotic American 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸after learning South Carolina along with US history (I initially hated history because I thought it was boring but by 7th grade I became interested) and by 2019 I read a book during my senior year in high school (not something we read as a class by the way but from my own interest from the school library) about the Russian Revolution. However it was mostly about Tsar Nicholas II and his family. If I remember correctly it was called “Family Romanov: Murder, Peace, Rebellion, & the Fall of Imperial Russia”. That was a phenomenal book that touched my heart and soul. I sympathized for them so much and I must also say I had a crush on Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna. She was with the rest of her family brutally murdered by Bolshevik guards when she was 19 and I was 19 at the time I read the book. Even though that was COMMUNISM you can’t have communism without socialism. That book is probably the real beginning of my anti socialist & communist feelings despite becoming patriotic around 2014/2015. I also developed monarchist sympathies around 2017 after reading a book about the French Revolution. Not that I have anything against OUR democracy in America. But I feel for royal families that were dehumanized and executed by revolutionaries. Especially the French and Russian Revolutions. The neglect and especially deliberate mistreatment of children is NEVER under any circumstance forgivable or justified even for the sake of republic and will of the people. Which is what occurred during both revolution. But the Romanov book is probably what truly repulsed me from socialism and anything socialist from a historical standpoint. Just think about my profile name. That book has an influence on me to this day.   Now, with that being said, I am very capitalist. You said you are capitalist too. And I believe you. I’m just MORE capitalist. I even believe in the removal of minimum wage. I know you find that crazy. Feel free to ask me why. I just don’t time to explain that at the moment.

I would think they would have realized long ago that people want government efficiency and solutions for problems that actually affect their lives instead of the government dictating to me what gender is or isn’t.   It pisses me off every time I hear conservative complain how government is “too big” and is against government programs that actually help  Pay tens of thousands a year in state and Federal taxes and I expect to see that money used in ways to benefit our citizens. They have somehow been convinced that our taxes should not be used to help Americans in need or to improve our lives, but happily applaud like the morons they are every time millionaires and Billionaires are given Trillions more in tax breaks so they can keep even more of their money. These people don’t seem to realize that at the end of the day WE end up paying for these tax breaks.  Economic morons, the lot of them!  I’ll be frank, the obsession the right wing has with white racial grievances and white racial entitlement to those country is absolutely tearing this country apart.

"You seem to think I should be providing and debating specific examples, and trying to convince you that I'm right.  That's not what's happening here.  You've already outed yourself as a bigot, so I don't reckon you deserve any such consideration.  I'm just here to amuse myself.  But if you want a good example of how DEI is routinely used to illegally discriminate based on race/gender, take a look at the recent Supreme Court decision on Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard.  I'm not going to do your research for you, but feel free to google that if you want to understand how and why DEI is being dismantled.  And how Democrats lost the trust of millions of Americans via their woke moral panic.  As for Claudine Gay, she was only in her position because of her race/gender.  She was never qualified, handled it poorly, and refused to stand up against blatant antisemitism.  And even after all that, she remains employed at Harvard as a grievance-studies professor with a very cushy salary.  Fact is that Democrats made it their policy to openly and proudly disparage, misrepresent, and discriminate against white people and male people.  A literal majority of voters, that is.

"Yes, I'll agree with you. It's such a complex problem with many different sources. The left, speaking on the past decade or so, have allowed culture issues to take the forefront. The issues you're referring to have always been state responsibilities. I think social media has been a detriment to politics by derailing major economic focuses and by creating a populism push. It created a popularity contest that required everyone to keep up with what is trending.  As a result, we end up with hyper focus on subjects that affect a small position of our parties, that ultimately needs to be left up to the state. I think the historic win of legalizing gay marriage energized the lgbtq community. But I believe they skipped steps from local, to state, to federal in their process, and thanks to social media, the goals bled into states that were very behind on the times.   On the right however, there is an opposite affect occurring. While the areas on the left our very progressive culturally to the point of speed running progress with great social pressure to support it, the right from Southern conservative states suffer from their own circumstances.   Those states were the homes of many of the losers of the civil war in the mid 1940s. They fought to maintain slavery, then they crafted him Crow, implemented paid prison systems to maintain cheap labor through involuntary work, and were the primary locations for bringing in immigrants from Southern countries for additional cheap labor- first through allowing Mexican immigrants in without quota, then criminalizing is with US law 1325 1326, and then through the Bracero Programs in the 1940s. They sent most of the Nazi scientists to the south as well, with Operation paperclip, and their families assimilated into the public schooling system and work force as well (with assistance, unlike minority immigrants). They also exploited native American and prison labor and more to mine uranium, without warning that it was radioactive and caused a great deal of illness and harm. Trump wishes to reopen uranium mines in America.  The South has always been the forefront of exploitation labor. They had many family who wanted uphold their economic ways of life, and kept making new ways to uphold it. But they also were paranoid of retaliation from minorities every time the laws pushed for more civil rights. It was easy to get the southern people to align with business-centric ways of thinking because human rights ways of thinking with undermine their profits.   Many poor people in those areas, however, did not read those profits, but we're typically included in the exploitation. But it was also easy to convince those people that this was due to the evolving civil rights movements at the time. It was easy to point to immigration, because those areas were full of immigrants, but those immigrants were encouraged to come in not even a few decades ago. So when people were forced to start paying people equal wages, they began to point to the fact that those jobs were competition for white Southerners.  A lot of white Southerners didn't understand why these things were happening, but they were ripe from manipulation to blame minorities for why things were changing in their way of life. And because the criminalization of minorities was so strong, it was easy to brand minorities as criminals. These locations were also extremely underfunded, especially as Losers of the war. They remain behind on technology, and they don't get a decent amount of investment in their schools. Many more urban schools, at least in the good neighborhoods, get all of the best books and resources and educators, well a lot of Southern states, even in white neighborhoods, define their economic system crumbling.   It doesn't help that, historically, the people who ran the country and were in charge of education were the most resistant to change when it came to teaching more modern education. As curriculums evolved to include better accounts of history, it displayed their people or their religion as wrong.   I can't say whether it was specifically the civil war that was a catalyst of the biggest divide in our country, but currently we are experiencing the biggest divide in the country, and it's mostly split between the lines that the civil war originated from.  So even though the talking points are so frustrating, there are a result of the the civil war. Progress was the primary goal of a lot of people fighting for their rights in these more liberal locations. While economic control in prosperity became the primary conversations of the conservative states. And that's the two parties began to polarize on civil rights issues versus economic issues, but then it was easy to make them fight amongst each other because one side would ignore the others needs.",marvelescent,2025-03-27T05:49:44,2
