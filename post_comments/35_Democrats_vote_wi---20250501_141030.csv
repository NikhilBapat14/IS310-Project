It’s absurd. A gas ban in 2035.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-05-01T14:39:13,126

"Hey, I’m all for electric cars. Seem like they have some great potential and the new sodium batteries look slick. But let them be so superior the old system fades away, not mandated by clueless bureaucrats.",Blarghnog,2025-05-01T23:59:03,10
As a democrat in California even I found this mandate dumb. I’m quite glad it got blocked.,Extension-Carry-8067,2025-05-01T18:31:01,3
Nice.  There's some dispute over whether this can be done or not via the CRA.  Congress may need to pass legislation to ensure this doesn't get bogged down (absurdly) in the courts.

"Banning gas car, and at the same time probably against mining for minerals to make the batteries in EVs.",ohhhbooyy,2025-05-01T20:40:08,1
I won't go back to California until they rent regular cars again. It really sucks to have to deal with an EV rental there. Absolute nightmare.,FudgeTerrible,2025-05-02T01:53:08,1
Not really. 164 still voted in favor of upholding the ban.,daspes1269,2025-05-01T20:34:16,35
"I've shifted my views a lot on EVs, now I've finally owned one.   EVs do not suck. They do a lot of things amazingly well. They're a lot cheaper to run than gas cars, easier to maintain (maybe it's just me having owned a lot of shitty brands like Jeep, Ford and Mercedes before but they broke often and cost a lot to fix), and in many ways are more fun to drive.   However, they do not replace ICE, supplement maybe, not replace. Banning gas cars is dumb as hell, especially since for all the things they do well, there's a lot they do very poorly at (trunk space, towing and long trips, for a start).",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-02T07:45:47,12

It’s so no one can drive their U-Haul out of the state.,Szorja,2025-05-01T22:43:14,9
"That's fine. Even elon must doesn't wanna force ev's om us. He wants to sell them obviously but its ur choice gas, diesal or ev.   Im planning to buy a diesal truck in 2026. I'm 31, I drive a ford fiesta. A diesal truck is wat ive always wanted. I like the sound and etc of it.",craig_52193,2025-05-02T06:09:34,0
"And the 35 who voted otherwise probably did so because they hate Elon/Tesla, not because they recognize bad policy.",_Eggs_,2025-05-01T23:55:01,10
"Guess what, I own a Tesla. EVs suck. There's nothing they do better than ICE and they're not really cheaper in the long run. ""More fun to drive"" is the biggest joke of all.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-02T09:47:21,0
"The math doesn't lie.   https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/  Of course, it also does depend where you stay. CA, PA or IL with sky high gas taxes, it gets cheaper real quick. I live in a red state with still relatively high gas taxes, and my previous cars had really big repair bills, so I found it much cheaper to drive an EV, albeit with significant constraints.   Of course, if you live in TX or KS with some of the lowest taxes you may feel differently. That's fair.   Fun to drive is subjective. I definitely enjoyed it more than the shitty Hondas I had in college, and not too dissimilar with the Mercedes. But what do I know, Chrysler conned me into being a jeep owner. Lol.",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-02T10:12:06,3
There is no reason to ban any vehicle. Let the consumer decide. I have a 2015 Tundra that I will drive until it can’t be fixed. I don’t drive it everyday so paying for gas isn’t a big deal. Plus my local grocery store gives points for gas or groceries. I just filled the Tundra for 27 dollars. I got 1.90 off a gallon. At almost 21 gallons to fill I saved a nice chunk of change. This will last three weeks maybe a month. Rinse and repeat.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-04T15:15:07,1
"Okay. But the question is does your EV have built in coverage for when batteries need to be replaced. In theory, yes obviously not real world, an ICE doesn't need to be pulled and replaced. EVs do.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-04T22:02:30,1
"Wow a site called ""choose EV"" says EVs are good. I'm shocked.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-02T11:15:38,1
"I agree. Zero reason to ban gas vehicles.   All I said are that EV vehicles are not crap. I personally don't believe ""they save the earth"" (in fact, they're more polluting in a lot of ways). That doesn't mean they don't have a use case.   Same for gas-powered vehicles. I believe we'll always need them around in some form, even if battery technology improves.",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-04T20:05:26,1
">But the question is does your EV have built in coverage for when batteries need to be replaced. In theory, yes obviously not real world, an ICE doesn't need to be pulled and replaced. EVs do.  This is correct and also why I don't believe the climate cults nonsense about EVs saving the world.   However, I'm also someone who grew up in the 80s and so I've seen how long lasting reliable items got replaced by things with shorter lifespans but arguably provided more utility or better looks. Think crt tvs being replaced by plasma and now LED (i think my dad's old Sony 20' TV from the 80s still works, you'll never see that today), or fragile iPhones replacing unbreakable Nokias.   Ultimately as battery tech evolves there will be economical places to replace EV batteries, just like how you replace your iPhone batteries at the Apple store.",funny_flamethrower,2025-05-04T22:56:21,1
The biggest threat if any conflict starts imo is an EMP. That kills all EV’s and almost all ICE vehicles. I’m trying to get my hands on a truck with a carburetor and no electronics. I think I heard the cutoff is 85-87. I just need something I can park in the barn and drive it here and there.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-05-05T06:46:43,1
