I think I've seen this one before. ðŸ¤”,3x0dusxx,2025-04-30T09:49:06,60
Yeah. He's definitely going to El Salvador as some Doge mook is cracking open that Photoshop for some good old fashioned ***just say yes*** evidence.,TheRustFactory,2025-04-30T09:56:05,31
Does MAGA listen to judges? Maybe I missed something recently.,faith_apnea,2025-04-30T12:45:38,9
Any Americans who are okay with Mahdawi's detention should have their loyalty to this country called into question.,wefarrell,2025-04-30T12:58:18,7

"... Or what, exactly?Â    I'm waiting for some judge to grow a pair and actually hold Trump in contempt. I may be waiting a long time.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-30T12:42:06,3
Mohsen Mahdawi. He has a name. These deliberately toned down headlines ðŸ™ˆ,D0tT0Th3C0m,2025-05-01T05:53:07,1
Luckily heâ€™s already been released.,sum1sedate-me,2025-04-30T14:00:10,9
Apparently there are videos of him being released after this order  https://abcnews.go.com/US/lawyers-columbia-student-detained-ice-seek-release-case/story?id=121317902,Lantis28,2025-04-30T10:53:34,27
"There was no or what. The judge ordered Mohsen Mahdawi released and ICE released him. Mohdawi made a great statement crediting the courage of the judge. Many are ready to give up, and I understand that, but there is no ""it's over"" there's just all of us creating our future.",johnabbe,2025-04-30T12:53:40,11
"Some luck, I'm sure, and a metric ton of good work that people put into securing his release. Hundreds more to go. https://disappeared.us/",johnabbe,2025-04-30T14:40:12,12
