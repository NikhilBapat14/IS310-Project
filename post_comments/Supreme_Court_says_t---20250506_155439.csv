Draft dodger says what?,AbjectList8,2025-05-06T15:59:08,31
"Ok, so there's some legal confusion here. All the court did is put a stay on the injunction that was preventing the White House from kicking people out now. It has NOT decided the case as a whole. The headline is true in effect, but doesn't explain how the legal system works with injunctions.  The TL;DR is that an Injunction can only be granted when the result of allowing the defendant to move forward causes ""irreparable harm"". Now that term is not as clear, legally, as it sounds. If the plaintiffs can get money or reinstatement as part of the end result of the lawsuit that covers the ""damages"", then it is not usually considered ""irreparable harm"" in the legal sense.   Which IS kind of dumb as the mental or emotional toll is not usually accounted for as a legal definition for ""irreparable harm"".  If there's one thing I've learned by paying attention to ""law tubers"" - it's that the legal system and its terms are NOT usually cut and dry as they seem when read......   All that said, I still don't like the decision",EagleDelta1,2025-05-06T16:53:22,14
That's really fucked up. The court is now just Trump's bitch. They'll probably even approve jailing judges and exempt themselves.,backpackwayne,2025-05-06T16:00:55,5

So they want to give some of their most determined soldiers a reason to be angry at the country?  Interesting strategy.,AlanShore60607,2025-05-06T17:48:34,0

"There's a bit more than an emotional or mental toll.   The military provides a lot for it's members. Job, pay, housing, healthcare for them and their dependents. Being forcibly removed from the military will uproot their lives in nearly every aspect.   Worse still with how the ban was worded I doubt they are planning to give whoever is removed a honorable discharge. Anything less than a honorable discharge and you may as well have a felony on your record, life becomes much harder obtaining a number of things due to this.  Allowing the ban to go into effect while they deliberate the case further will unquestionably cause irreparable harm.",CarolinaBat,2025-05-06T19:13:03,5
"I appreciate the clarification and diligence in ensuring the article is correctly understood. That being said I still find it disheartening that the highest court in the land doesnâ€™t see or appreciate the sacrifices trans individuals have made, and are willing to make for this country. And that makes me very sad ðŸ˜”",RubArtistic4683,2025-05-06T17:29:52,7
