"Ah, Trevor, you make a good point here! It’s interesting how these terms come and go, like the seasons, you know?

Maybe they think people want to hear about new things instead of the same old arguments.

"All those terms are not the same.   One could be opposed to DEI, as there are many examples where the bounds of the program overstepped their reach. Take for example some recommended trainings or reading materials that were recommended. White Fragility and How to be an Anti Racist are prime examples of this overreach. It's one thing to remind all people that you will have some natural biases, it's quite another to say <insert ethnic group> is always <insert generalization>.  This is before we take some of the hiring initiatives that were done during this period that were likely in violation of the Civil Rights act of 1964. You might argue those policies were feckless, but you can look up the results at some of our most prestigious tech companies and how their demographics changed over the last 8 years. Take one example in 2016 Microsoft had around 55% of their tech employees were white, and now it's down to 43%. If it was more representative of the population it would be closer to 60%, or since they are based in Washington, closer to 70%.  Similar feelings with CRT. While the term itself was a catch all term, that was used more widely than appropriate, we also know of the absolute excesses that were going on in schools. Separating children into oppressors and oppressed is not only not accurate, but also wrong to do.

"Why shouldnt it be taught in elementary schools?  The issue isnt critical race theory, its the fact that Republicans are modern day Nazis.  In the U.S., elementary school goes to what?  The fifth grade, and you dont want to teach 9-11 year olds the fact that when people use the term 'race' to refer to humans, that its a social construct?  Race in a biological sense does not exist in Homo sapiens anymore, since all the others have gone extinct.  And lets not teach kids in public schools about systemic discrimination in our society because that subject is uncomfortable for their 'racist' parents...  Are we going to completely ignore social sciences, history and biology in our school system as well?  This is a good start.

"The thesis of How to Be an Anti-Racist by Ibram X. Kendi is not ""to remind all people they you will have some natural biases"". It is to inform and brightline the fact that systemic racism and white supremacy are modern, socially constructed artifacts created to justify subjugating marginalized groups. Yes, it is natural to have biases. But whiteness is not a natural law - just ask the Irish and the Italians, two peoples who had to assimilate into whiteness when immigrating into the United States in order to escape the racism and mistreatment they faced here.   The point of the book is to show that white supremacy is so ubiquitous that it renders itself invisible to those raised within it or makes racism an individual character flaw. Kendi's argument is that because of this, it is not enough to say ""I'm not racist"". To overcome the systemic nature of white supremacy, we have to be able to identify it, and actively work against it - to *do* anti-racist things, not just *be* ""not racist"". CRT and DEI are two frameworks for making that systemic nature explicit, analyzing problems from that starting point, and recommending solutions.   CRT is not in fact a catch-all term - it is a legal framework that conservatives construed as being promoted in schools. What they could have more accurately described would be teaching about racism using a historically literate, justice-oriented pedagogy. The point is not to ""separate children into oppressors and oppressed"" - that's another overgeneralized conservative talking point - it's to help students of all backgrounds understand the origins of injustice and see how those with power, typically gained through proximity to whiteness, maleness, and owning property, have used their powert to keep others down using various identity markers as justifications for their oppression.

"> just ask the Irish and the Italians, two peoples who had to assimilate into whiteness when immigrating into the United States in order to escape the racism and mistreatment they faced here  It's a bit of revisionist history to say that Irish and Italians were not considered white. They were *ethnic* whites and discriminated against for their ethnicity, but still considered white. We struggle with this today because we rarely distinguish white Americans by ethnicity and focus almost exclusively on race rather than ethnicity (to the point where we commonly consider Hispanic to be its own racial category). So we misunderstand and assume that if they were discriminated against based on ancestry, they must not have been considered white. But, we can simply look to the laws to see what group they were in. Irish and Italians could attend white-only schools, drink from the white water fountains, marry other whites of any ethnicity, etc. We're talking about a period of history when mixed-race black people would claim to be Arab because Arabs were also considered white. But anyways, Kendi...  No one should take Kendi seriously. His foundational idea is that if you're not being actively anti-racist, you are engaging in racism. And he hasn't really thought this through. A white parent takes their kid to soccer practice -- this is racist. White kids participate in more extracurricular activities than black kids, so the parent is not only not working to reduce the disparity, but is in fact worsening it. They're actively racist. It's facile.  Decreasing the capital gains tax rate? Racist, because white people benefit more. Keeping it the same? Racist as well. Doubling it? Anti-racist, but if you double it and then stop increasing it, back to racism. In fact, failing to increase it to over 100%, that's racist.

The President is free to choose those who will effectively implement their policies and values.   However, the Constitution does not grant the Senate the authority to set qualifications or impose criteria for these appointments.

"But you’re being disingenous. The rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion isn’t in the name of still being or even pivoting to being an inclusive, merit-based country.

Don’t spray a mound of shit with air freshener and tell us it’s pinewood.  The constant shifting of the target from political correctness to social justice to CRT to DEI (all of which labels used to obstruct the central premise of what they’re railing against, diversity and inclusion, in order to make it sound palatable to attack and dismantle) is just always been their way of trying to package a bad faith rollback of progress to meet their own ends",littlebiped,2025-05-07T23:03:30,8

"Again, kids in schools were *literally* beaten for using their left hands, within living memory. This is well documented if you have even a modicum of intellectual curiosity.  Or is it only institutional oppression if they're excluded in your book?  And pointing out that there were places in the world where black people were not discriminated against doesn't somehow change the character of the subsequent centuries of Western Civilization. Just because some North Africans held positions in the Roman Empire doesn't somehow make institutional racism subsequent to that not a thing. Same with women: just because they weren't purely chattle doesn't mean that they weren't still second class citizens for most of human history. The world isn't black and white where only total discrimination and subjugation count as discrimination.  And there were places in the world where trans people weren't discrimated against as well, you're just content to invent justifications for why that's not 'real' acceptance because it doesn't mesh with your worldview. Again, you've come up in a society where historical bigotry is no longer socially acceptable, and have made the assumption that *those* prior hierarchies were actually artificial and your heriarchy is actually the natural order of things. But a phernologist 300 years ago didn't think he was making up an excuse to treat black people as inherently inferior: he thought he was merely quantifying the natural world. It was not that long ago that people were making basically the exact same argument about gay people merely existing that you're making right here.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-08T09:50:09,1
"See, that's what I mean. Because you've decided that those particular third genders are 'shamanic', they're not real in your book. But it's still a recognized third gender in their culture. And that's setting aside that it's largely a gross simplification that overlooks a lot of other 'Third Genders' that aren't involved directly in religious ritual. Looking at pre-contact American cultures, Vedic south Asian cultures, Polynesian cultures and even early polytheistic Near Eastern and Western cultures and there's numerous carve outs for people that don't fit comfortably in the gender binary. Some of those are for religious reasons, yes, but not all of them. You don't seem to have even gone as far as read a *wikipedia article* on the subject if you think that the only non-binary genders outside male and female are inextricably tied to a religious practice.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-08T11:41:53,2
"It’s not that shamanism makes them not real…  But advocating that a group shouldn’t be institutional dissidents, by using historical examples that themselves were institutional dissidents…  Doesn’t make any sense",ttown2011,2025-05-08T15:36:08,1
You're making up your own terms to describe things you only half understand. That's the main reason for the criticism of your 'shamanism' canard: that only applies to a handful of cases and you seem to be unaware of anything beyond them.,VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-08T15:37:41,2
"Shamans gain power and legitimacy from being outside the institutional circle, and then use that authority to convey legitimacy on the secular power  That’s how tribal leadership is structured, and you see vestiges in institutional religions such as Christian authorities conveying legitimacy in the monarchical system  Yes- I have no idea what I’m talking about",ttown2011,2025-05-08T15:42:37,1
"Yes, you have no idea what you're talking about because most third genders in other cultures are not 'shaman'. You're conflating a half remembered story about how a specific culture handled a specific case (likely something to do with Native American belief, or possibly the way Greek polytheism treated some priestesses as seperate gender since they didn't marry or have children) and using that to create an imagined system you've barely explained that negates any non-binary gender systems that challenge your preconception that trans people are an entirely modern phenomenon. Vedic belief systems, for instance, reserved a gender for people that performed roles that didn't match their birth gender without any inherent religious function. A more Western example would be Albanian Sworn Virgins who were treated as culturally distinct from simply a woman who's doing a man's job.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-08T15:49:59,2
"The shamanism isn’t the main issue, it’s being outside of the institutional circle  Shamans are outside the circle by definition   Your Vedic example, the Hidjras were not accepted in Vedic society- they were institutional dissidents.  To this day they are often restricted in where they can live etc.  The Etruscan mystery cult… was a mystery cult   Two spirit (what but that’s true) mostly lived outside of society (and were shamanic)  I don’t know enough about your Albanian example, so I can’t particularly comment- but if it’s like the Caucasian monks, same issue",ttown2011,2025-05-08T15:54:28,1
"'Existing outside the institutional circle' is not the same thing as trans people being an entirely modern development. You're talking out of both sides of your mouth. Trans people can't simultaneously date back to the *Etruscans* and be a new phenomenon. You have this weirdly black and white thinking where things can only ever be entirely commonplace and uncommented on or a threat to the fundamental social order. And even *then* not all of them exist outside 'the institutional circle'. Do you know anything about Polynesian gender structures, or Native American ones?

"I specifically referenced native Americans.   Two spirits (what bits that are true) and beardaches were shamanic figures or figures to at least be seen as having “medicine” or mystical power. (Or they were treated like total shit) They were also often pushed out and lived on the outskirts of society   It’s hard to talk about native Americans as one people- you’re talking about hundreds of different cultures   No, I’m not particularly familiar with the Polynesians",ttown2011,2025-05-08T16:04:58,1
"See, this is what I'm talking about with you not actually doing any research into the people in question. 'Beardache' is widely considered a slur in communities that have multiple gender roles: 'Two Spirit' was a relatively modern (like, 1990's modern) attempt to pick a catch all term to describe the various Native American third+ genders, which is itself somewhat contentious in Native American communities. It's also not a historical thing, there are Native Americans that identify outside the gender binary within their specific cultural contexts alive today. The whole mystical conception of it is largely due to cultural Christians trying to fit it into their binary gender worldview in the same way you are.   Polynesians similarly have a variety of different genders outside of male and female. An American example would be the Samoan fa'afafine, but multiple cultures have similar gender expressions. Some of them do fit into your 'shamanistic' framework like the Hawaiian māhū, but a lot of them are just a third, minority gender within their society.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-08T16:17:31,1
