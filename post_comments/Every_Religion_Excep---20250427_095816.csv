"Whether it be the Moors, the Mongols, the Romans or the Greeks...whoever, virtually every country on Earth was at one time conquered and 'colonized' by another. History can be inconvenient for those who choose to ignore or deny it.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-27T11:23:31,207
You could argue all religions are supremacist religions because they think they’re right at expense of everyone else’s beliefs.   What you can’t do is give Islam a carve out when they of all religions have a built in special taxation for non believers and specifically denigrate more than others religions people ‘not of the book’ and have special rules for how awful you can treat them. Christianity and Judaism sure do not like paganism but the specificity and prescriptiveness of Islam to polytheistic religions is particularly notable,YoNoSoyUnFederale,2025-04-27T11:31:19,118

Yep. And Islam is the largest conquering and colonizing political/religious state in modern times.,sowellpatrol,2025-04-28T01:59:47,26

I am not sure what your point is with the passages from scripture.   Christianity does indeed say that it is the only way (and as a Christian I’m obligated to agree) and your quotations support that.  I just think Islam’s commandments for nonbelievers in the physical world are much prescriptive and draconian than other major world religions,YoNoSoyUnFederale,2025-04-27T12:22:05,43
My point is exactly your second paragraph (2nd sentence),JesusDied4U316,2025-04-27T12:23:19,1
Ok got you. I wasn’t trying to claim Christianity is not a religion that doesn’t think it is the only way I just was using it to contrast with scripturally institutionalized second class treatment and violence against non believers that the Quran has.  Christianity doesn’t think well if nonbelievers but it hopes through evangelization and being a model of morality for others it can convert nonbelievers. Obviously violence has been justified using Christianity but I think there’s a lot less New Testament scripture that calls for violence and oppression of non believers,YoNoSoyUnFederale,2025-04-27T12:31:04,17
