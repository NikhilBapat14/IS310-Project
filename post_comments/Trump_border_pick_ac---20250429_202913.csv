"**TL;DR**: Rodney Scott, Trump’s CBP nominee, faces accusations of overseeing a ""cover-up"" in the 2010 death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas, a detainee beaten by agents. A former CBP official alleges Scott unlawfully obtained medical records to spin the case. Critics cite his history of downplaying family separations and ties to a racist Border Patrol Facebook group.",pharrt,2025-04-29T20:30:40,61
"""In other instances, a border patrol agent shared in the group a picture of a drowned immigrant father and child and referred to them as “floaters”, while a supervisor posted an internal video of an immigrant fatally falling from a cliff.""  For reference if there is any actual human with actual emotions that could forget. But it seems the US is producing monsters these days.  https://www.npr.org/2019/06/26/736177694/a-father-and-daughter-drowned-at-the-border-put-attention-on-immigration",ResignedFate,2025-04-29T21:35:21,22
I would think that would help him get the job. Because he's probably going to have to do that many more times under Trump.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T21:09:44,5

"Was wondering why he'd need to cover it up. This admin wouldn't even reprimand an agent beating a detainee to death, but it happened in 2010 when ICE had at least a few guardrails.",travio,2025-04-29T20:35:42,20

The right has totally dehumanized immigrants. There is nothing good in the future of a nation that supports and applauds psychopaths for doing obviously psychopathic things.,PolygonMan,2025-04-30T11:15:09,2
