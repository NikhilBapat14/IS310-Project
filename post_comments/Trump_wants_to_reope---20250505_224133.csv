No. He watched Escape from Alcatraz. It aired on Mar-a-Lago's PBS affiliate not long before he started ranting about Alcatraz. He also slipped up and mentioned movies in a word salad rant earlier today when asked about it.,Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-05T22:43:42,1673
He totally referenced sending someone to Alcatraz and was reminded that it closed decades ago and is a museum. To save face in case he name drops Alcatraz again he is having it reopened (probably can't remember the names of any other prisons).,Lostinthestarscape,2025-05-05T22:49:32,160

"Per chatgpt:  Reestablishing Alcatraz Island as a modern supermax prison for 500 inmates would be a massive and logistically complex project. Here's a rough cost estimate broken into major components:   ---  1. Demolition of Existing Structures  Full teardown of the deteriorated historic prison and other non-salvageable facilities (environmentally sensitive process due to protected status): $100–150 million (Includes asbestos abatement, environmental protections, and work by marine contractors.)    ---  2. Island Stabilization and Infrastructure Upgrades  Foundation work, erosion control, island stabilization: $75–100 million  Utility infrastructure (power, water desalination, wastewater treatment, HVAC, and fire suppression): $150–200 million    ---  3. Construction of Modern Supermax Facility  500-inmate supermax prison built to ADX Florence standards (~$700K–$1M per bed, higher due to remote location): $350–500 million  Includes security tech, isolation cells, reinforced structures, air/water filtration, etc.    ---  4. Transportation Infrastructure (Off-Island and Marine)  Dedicated ferry system and dock improvements, emergency evacuation infrastructure, maintenance barge systems: $75–100 million    ---  5. Staff Housing and Support Facilities (On or Near Island)  If housing is built on the island (likely necessary for 24/7 staffing): $100–150 million (Housing, commissary, clinic, recreation for ~300–400 staff.)    ---  6. Security and Communications Infrastructure  Encrypted comms, surveillance, maritime radar perimeter, drone defense, etc.: $50–75 million    ---  7. Permitting, Environmental Compliance, Legal, and Public Engagement  Alcatraz is a National Historic Landmark and part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, requiring extensive NEPA, NHPA, and California Coastal Commission compliance: $50–100 million    ---  8. Contingency & Cost Overruns (~20%)  ~$200–300 million   ---  Total Estimated Cost Range  $1.2 billion – $1.7 billion   ---  Would you like a visual breakdown chart or a cost model that could be adjusted for inmate capacity or location type?",MajesticsEleven,2025-05-05T23:20:55,-34

Reagan had a history of being severely influenced by movies.  I still remember hearing about how at a UN meeting or something he basically stopped everything to ask that if aliens attack Earth if Russia would set aside their differences to help us fight back.  Mental decline is a hell of a thing.,UnquestionabIe,2025-05-06T07:21:22,5

Pretty sure it’s a reference to a viral tweet from his first term where someone posted a fake excerpt of a book talking about aides creating a special “gorilla channel” at Trump’s demand.  I can’t find a screenshot of the tweet and tbh I didn’t look super hard. Googling it would find a bunch of articles about it but they’re all just finger wagging at the few people who actually believed the tweet.,-Auvit-,2025-05-06T06:58:04,8
