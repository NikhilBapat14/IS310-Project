"The hilarity to me is that his supporters think he is playing 4d chess. Everything he does is exactly what I‚Äôd expect an 7 year old to suggest as a solution. It‚Äôs shockingly simple minded, obviously introduces significant issues/contradictions, may even be unethical, and lacks any overall strategic plan.",Quiet-Competition849,2025-04-03T23:16:33,29
