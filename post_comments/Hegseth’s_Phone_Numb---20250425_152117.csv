"From the article:  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs zero percent chance that someone hasn‚Äôt tried to install Pegasus or some other spyware on his phone,‚Äù Mike Casey, the former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told the Times. ‚ÄúHe is one of the top five, probably, most targeted people in the world for espionage.‚Äù  Ineptitude at its best",kootles10,2025-04-25T15:21:57,133

"The United States does not currently have a functioning national security apparatus.

Anyone can bribe a mobile store manager and one of them will take the bribe.  Then the manager just logs in and pin swaps.  That means the hacker can leave the store with a new phone with Hegseth‚Äôs number on it.  2FA would go to the new phone.  What a complete opsec weakness.

"And now you have all of these companies with these very big track records of all of these leaks requiring you to provide them with cellphone numbers and they're selling them to these third-parties and no one even knows what these third parties are doing with these numbers (just look at all the very bad things that they were doing with all of those Cambridge Analytica numbers and personal information and who was all exposed to that) and who knows who was accidentally allowed to be in this Party Pete's butt-dialed group chats full of his personal circle of friends and what these third party advertisers were data mining from the list of ""Pete's Pals"" personal cellphones with their numbers tied to them or who was buying these zero-click exploits from these very sloppy mistake-orientated individuals. And these companies they have very little liability from very terrible information policies or exposing people to these risks and there's very little repercussions for them besides $3.72 class action payments that must file by a filing date or you surrender rights because of the very good RVs they've given to people to get these very big favors.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-25T15:53:58,11
