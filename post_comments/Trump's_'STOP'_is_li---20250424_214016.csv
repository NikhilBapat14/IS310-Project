It will be interesting to see what Trump does next. He‚Äôs put a lot of political capital into being the one who can get this war to end. I‚Äôd say time is running out and I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs willing to do what is likely needed to end the war.   It‚Äôs a put up or shut up moment for Trump and the U.S.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-25T00:27:58,376

Zelensky has lost.  We‚Äôre out and the rest of the world is not going to escalate alone against Putin.  It‚Äôs just a matter now of that crook skimming the last of his country‚Äôs wealth before he resigns and surrenders or suffers worse.  There is nothing more for Trump to do here.,cchris_39,2025-04-25T06:02:37,-59
"Dictator, like refusing to held democratic presidential elections, at the cover of prolonging the stupid war?",AstraVolans_21,2025-04-25T05:17:01,-72
How is the US expected to have any decision or impact in stopping Russia from waging a war without putting American troops in Ukraine?  Edit: alright this sub is cooked with brigaders that won‚Äôt even make an argument.,Ubechyahescores,2025-04-25T01:46:53,-57
"I think President Trump assumed he will be dealing with sane people in trying to stop the war, not with psycho warmongers that play games at the expense of innocent human lives.",AstraVolans_21,2025-04-25T05:18:08,-54
"Fake conservatives everywhere.   We‚Äôre not going boots on the ground even if it means losing all of Ukraine. Russia is not the great China is, and the EU needs to step the fuck up if Putin is that bad.",Bringon2026,2025-04-25T10:41:25,-15
"I am sorry, you expect a result overnight? It can take days in our own government just to decide whether to name a federal road something let alone any government forming a peace accord.  Sadly though, many men are dying while they wait.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-25T04:40:57,-67
"It doesn't even have to be anything major like sending troops. Just send Ukraine some more weapons. Shit, maybe even just sell them the missile defenses they offered to pay for that Trump has refused.",cathbadh,2025-04-25T07:07:50,137
"Agreed, but ""STOP"" doesn't have that tone at all.  I get that Trump is just short of a pacifist, but Putin is directly giving him the finger. If Trump capitulates in search of peace, he'll look as weak as Biden and that will give the green light to anyone (China) looking to expand their territory.  Rewarding aggression, begets more aggression.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-25T12:26:32,26
Kinda wish there was an option to sort by most downvoted. It would help for threads like this where all the conservative opinions are getting mass downvoted by angry leftists.,inmuhead,2025-04-25T10:56:44,0
"At least Ukraine is honest about the elections (which BTW is required under their constitution), in Russia they have election, but they're fake. Is that an improvement?  Also, not everyone downvoting you is a liberal brigader, unless the definition of liberal brigader is anyone who downvotes anti-Ukraine sentiment, and in that case, guess I voted for the woman",AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-04-26T15:28:57,12

Basically every topic is flaired only so they can't just brigade every topic's comments section so they all just spam downvotes because that's the only thing they have in life.,ponmbr,2025-04-25T15:51:19,-5
