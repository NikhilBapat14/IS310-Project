"""Calanders"" are not yet set.  I suspect we'd have to spend serious time to track the two houses. Committee hearings, and subsequent votes are critical.",mgf1013,2023-01-22T22:24:18,1

"Congressional voting schedules are generally set two weeks ahead max.  One, you don’t know 100% what will be getting through committees. You can guess, but that’s all. So you first have to deal with things that are done with committees.  Two, stuff happens. A new war? Ah jeeze can it wait, we had this four month scheduled voting order already.  Three, it’s better to stay focused for both messaging and for avoiding messaging. Tell the [opposing side] that in three months this [bill they hate] will be voted on. Cool, thanks for the heads up, that’s 3 months to work with our allies, to build talking points, to go on tv.  You can check the cloakroom websites (such as https://repcloakroom.house.gov) but again, that’s a week max.  If it was more generally when do things get voted on, i think it’s just you know when the NDAA/Approps seasons come.",MrLegilimens,2023-01-23T05:21:11,1
"Yeah I saw that one too, it's like whoever was hired to update Congress's own website is skiving on the job.",Ok_Cow2667,2023-01-22T04:32:45,0
