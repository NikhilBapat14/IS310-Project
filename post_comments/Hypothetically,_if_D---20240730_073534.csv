"They could try, but it would need a filibuster-proof majority, which they likely won't have. Otherwise the opposition will just filibuster the bill until the next president is inaugurated and it dies right there.  If they do have the votes necessary to override a filibuster, then yes, they could make whatever they wanted law, and probably would.  Odds are only one major bill could be pushed through in that time period, though if any at all, and it will have needed to have gone through all the committees and been back and forth through both houses and such, which means it would have been cooking for a while, and the opposition isn't stupid enough not see it coming and set roadblocks to guarantee it won't hit the floor during that lame duck period.",periphery72271,2024-07-30T08:16:34,22
"Theoretically. The Congressional session begins noon January 3, 2023 and the Presidential term ends noon January 20, 2023.  The first day of Congress would be the Speaker vote and settling all the committees and what not.  There's a federal holiday in there to halt business.   But you have two full weeks if you really want to work it.",federalist66,2024-07-30T09:14:32,7
"Not high likelihood unless they have the bills already drafted. The drafting process can take longer than 10 days and then you have all the procedural crap to pass the bills, and the the president also has up to 10 days to sign the bill before it automatically turns into law if they don't sign it. Even with supermajorities, there are all kinds of stall tactics like Corum busting, fillibusters (if Supermajority isn't in sync) , endless amendments, poison pills, etc besides the normal stuff like committee work, markup, the bill may need a reconciliation. There really isn't much of a chance to pass major legislation in that time frame least it be a national emergency.",ParticularGlass1821,2024-07-30T09:25:15,2
"If they had a large enough majority, they could override Trump’s veto’s and pass any legislation they want. This happened to Reagan.",Laceykrishna,2024-07-30T10:47:57,1
"Remember, it takes 60 senate votes to pass any meaningful legislation. A bare majority or 50 plus the Vice President is for things like budget reconciliation.",enemy884real,2024-07-30T13:35:05,1

">They could try, but it would need a filibuster-proof majority, which they likely won't have.  And just for reference, there are 34 seats up for grabs. To get a filibuster proof majority in the Senate, the Democrats would need to win all but 2 of those elections. This would include flipping states like Utah, Wyoming, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, and Nebraska. The Democrats will have trouble keeping a Senate majority, so getting a filibuster proof majority is almost a nonstarter for the hypothetical.",ProLifePanda,2024-07-30T09:12:43,6
"> Odds are only one major bill could be pushed through in that time period  With only a period of about ten business days, I would agree with this.  Unless there is some emergency that they're trying to deal with so urgently (and in this case, there would probably be buy-in to moving fast from the new President), I just don't see how they could get through all the necessary steps to advance a bill to the President's desk in such a short period of time.  It'd also probably need to be a really simple bill because if there were any differences between the House and Senate's version, that conference would likely kill any chance of it getting to that desk.",AuditorTux,2024-07-30T08:34:51,2
> it would need a filibuster-proof majority  Could they change the filibuster rules first?,nosecohn,2024-07-31T02:29:20,1
Don't forget the Trump would have presidential immunity and would most likely do something illegal to void both the congress and house. We need to win this election to prevent him from being a dictator.,Glam-Girl2662,2024-08-06T09:02:20,1
"Yes, but any bill passed before Jan 20 is still liable to being vetoed by Trump after Jan. 20. And if they have the votes to override the veto, there’s no reason to hurry to pass it by Jan 20.",Dr_CleanBones,2024-07-30T10:59:20,2
"48 of the Senators who caucus with the Democrats are willing to amend the filibuster rules, only Manchin and Sinema are hold outs. If they can add 2 seats to the caucus who are aligned, they can do the nuclear option and pass anything with 50 plus VP.",fluffingdazman,2024-07-30T21:23:57,2

They could but it would be very hard - you'd need almost perfect cohesion to do that (which means no defectors) and usually that requires *days* to ensure it before they pull the trigger.  That's days they really don't have.,AuditorTux,2024-07-31T11:02:40,2

"Nuclear option sounds like it isn’t following the will of the people when it is supposed to be 60. Nuclear option sounds more like a desperate reach amidst a system designed for gridlock under such circumstances. There is a reason it gets locked up like this when it’s polarized. The system forces everyone to work it out through some other means, may get 60 senators eventually, the right way.",enemy884real,2024-07-30T22:19:11,3

"It was never supposed to be 60. The Constitution only requires simple majority for most things. It was Senators who made a procedural rule that 3/5 were needed to end *filibuster* which has changed drastically in use since the 70's. So the so-called ""nuclear option"" is just changing the procedural rules again to reduce to stopping power of the filibuster.   My take: The filibuster was intended to encourage discussion, but has lately been used to stifle it by preventing legislation coming to a vote. A more moderated use of the filibuster that is not unlimited would be ideal, still encouraging deliberation, but allowing the Senators to put their votes where their mouths are.",fluffingdazman,2024-07-30T22:40:29,2
