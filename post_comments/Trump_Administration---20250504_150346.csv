Just call it “keeping straight men super straight” and they’ll fund it. Sux to have to ruse it up…,fowlraul,2025-05-04T15:17:35,11
Because they want that community dead.  Confront a MAGA about it and they’ll pull the “nuh uh” card but they do.  Every last one of them would be very happy if the LGBTQ community just died off.,Popculturemofo,2025-05-04T15:52:38,12
I was in a gay men's cohort study for almost a decade and yeah they cancelled it last month.,Kankarn,2025-05-04T19:43:30,5

"San Francisco State study: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth have a higher rate of suicide attempts than do heterosexual youth.   [Trevor Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trevor_Project) 2023: 18% of LGBTQ youth have attempted suicide, which is two times higher than the general teen population.  MAGA does not care.",OrbeaSeven,2025-05-04T17:09:40,4
Half of the research slashed at the NIH was related to LGBTQ+ health and issues that more often affect them.,Frodojj,2025-05-04T16:09:50,8
Why the downvote? Genuinely curious.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-04T17:41:36,1
And it’s so much higher because people like these MAGA fucks actively try to ruin our lives and hide us in closets.,Emilia_Violet,2025-05-04T19:18:20,3
