"Exactly. Status quo, neoliberal democrats are why we‚Äôre in this mess in the first place. For 40 or 50 years now we‚Äôve had 2 political parties in the US: the pro-corporate power party, and the super pro-corporate power /  racist party.   The reason the current Dems have largely been so goddamn useless as fascism actively takes over is because, fundamentally, the only way out of this is with leftist economic policy; the Democrats would skyrocket in popularity if they got on board with the kinds of reforms that would actually make people‚Äôs lives better. But it‚Äôs the one line of political thought they absolutely refuse to explore, as it would hurt their rich donors. So instead they sit around with their thumbs up their asses, desperately looking for ways to get voters back on their side without ever actually changing anything for the better. It‚Äôs why they committed so hard to progressive social policy: oligarchs don‚Äôt give a shit about social policy either way, as it doesn‚Äôt hurt their bottom line. (I agree with progressive social policy, but still, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve clung to it so hard)   No more neoliberal candidates.",Devilnaht,2025-04-24T06:58:17,51
"Neoliberlism from centrist Democrats has greatly contributed to providing an opportunity for someone like Trump to emerge.  And now we see centrist voices (Newsom, Slotkin, etc.) being amplified as if there is a path to cooperation and capitulation with MAGA that both restores an opportunity for Democrats to return to power and avoids selling out marginalized communities.  Centrist Democrats are all about selling their souls for power, while voters want a clearly articulated vision for a better America based on values, principles and a higher calling to our purpose as a nation.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T07:46:10,34

"The question isn‚Äôt what Progressives want, it‚Äôs how many voters would actually vote for a Progressive candidate.   The dogma since Bill Clinton has been that Democrats can only succeed if they stay moderate, or potentially even adopt blatantly Republican ideas.   The irony is that while Trump completely destroyed the idea on the Republican side of the necessity of moderation, the Democrats just kept doubling down that what the voters *really* want is more milquetoast.   It‚Äôs also worth emphasizing that *even after* Trump‚Äôs surprise victory in 2016, it really wasn‚Äôt until he won again in 2024 that the Republican establishment truly accepted that there was no place for moderates anymore.   Meaning, even a win by someone like AOC in 2028 won‚Äôt be enough to enact change at the political machine level.",kevihaa,2025-04-24T13:19:04,7

"I think people are really misunderstanding this. It's not neoliberal center left democrats, or farther left progressive democrats, that people are looking for. I think their actual policy positions have very, very little to do with what people want. A good example is Trump's ""concepts of a plan"" on healthcare, an issue that often tops people's concerns in yet for many people who had healthcare as a top concern, they voted for Trump.   What people actually want is two-fold.   1. Someone who is willing to fight  2. Someone who is an effective communicator.   This can come from the center left or the far left, it actually doesn't matter. People like AOC and Bernie right now because they are communicating and fighting. People liked what Van Hollen did going to El Salvador because he was showing people that he is willing to fight. It didn't have anything to do with being closer or farther from the center. Similar to Cory Booker's filibuster it showed his willingness to fight. People also really like Pete Buttigieg right now, despite him being closer to the center, because he is such an effective communicator, even in very hostile media environments like Fox or right-leaning podcasts.   Personally, I'm a policy guy, I like clear, coherent policy that I think will be effective at solving certain issues. This is not how most voters, even democratic voters, think or vote. It has a lot more to do with the vibes. AOC really isn't even that far off from Kamala; she just puts more emphasis on economic justice, but from a ""here is what we should actually try to do"" standpoint, they are very similar. It's just packaged differently. That's what people want a shiny package that speaks to them, even if the contents are the same as that boring package the center-left Dems have been pushing, but explaining terribly.   I just think this fight over policy is a bit misguided, especially when we saw how successful Trump was with almost no policy to speak of, and what little policy he had, it was incoherent and all over the place.",unholyravenger,2025-04-24T12:19:50,1

I just think that conflict arises when criticism of republicans is actively shut down and redirected to the democrats that aren't doing enough. I think that treating republicans as an absolute unchangeable evil is a great way to undermine ourselves politically. They are vulnerable to political change in different ways, but they are vulnerable, and we need to openly and clearly attack them as the actual problem, or we end up like the voters that went against Kamala because they believed the fiction that Biden and Trump were somehow equally bad on Gaza. Criticize the democrats, but keep focused on the republicans.",DarthEinstein,2025-04-24T12:26:51,1

Progressive candidates aren‚Äôt exactly a DNC priority. They won‚Äôt even *try* it. You‚Äôre blaming voters for failing to vote for a general election candidate that does not interest them in the least.
