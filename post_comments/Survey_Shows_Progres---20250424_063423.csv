"Exactly. Status quo, neoliberal democrats are why we’re in this mess in the first place. For 40 or 50 years now we’ve had 2 political parties in the US: the pro-corporate power party, and the super pro-corporate power /  racist party.   The reason the current Dems have largely been so goddamn useless as fascism actively takes over is because, fundamentally, the only way out of this is with leftist economic policy; the Democrats would skyrocket in popularity if they got on board with the kinds of reforms that would actually make people’s lives better. But it’s the one line of political thought they absolutely refuse to explore, as it would hurt their rich donors. So instead they sit around with their thumbs up their asses, desperately looking for ways to get voters back on their side without ever actually changing anything for the better. It’s why they committed so hard to progressive social policy: oligarchs don’t give a shit about social policy either way, as it doesn’t hurt their bottom line. (I agree with progressive social policy, but still, that’s why they’ve clung to it so hard)   No more neoliberal candidates.",Devilnaht,2025-04-24T06:58:17,51
"Neoliberlism from centrist Democrats has greatly contributed to providing an opportunity for someone like Trump to emerge.  And now we see centrist voices (Newsom, Slotkin, etc.) being amplified as if there is a path to cooperation and capitulation with MAGA that both restores an opportunity for Democrats to return to power and avoids selling out marginalized communities.  Centrist Democrats are all about selling their souls for power, while voters want a clearly articulated vision for a better America based on values, principles and a higher calling to our purpose as a nation.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T07:46:10,34

"The question isn’t what Progressives want, it’s how many voters would actually vote for a Progressive candidate.   The dogma since Bill Clinton has been that Democrats can only succeed if they stay moderate, or potentially even adopt blatantly Republican ideas.   The irony is that while Trump completely destroyed the idea on the Republican side of the necessity of moderation, the Democrats just kept doubling down that what the voters *really* want is more milquetoast.   It’s also worth emphasizing that *even after* Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, it really wasn’t until he won again in 2024 that the Republican establishment truly accepted that there was no place for moderates anymore.   Meaning, even a win by someone like AOC in 2028 won’t be enough to enact change at the political machine level.",kevihaa,2025-04-24T13:19:04,7

"Well yeah. The ""big tent"" strategy of the Democrats adopting all the fleeing conservatives from the Republican party has made the Democrats *into* the conservative party of the United States, standing across the aisle from the radical extremist right.

We don't want the 1950s, we want *progress*. Every American with a voice has been screaming for basic human rights like healthcare, and the Democrats meanwhile are playing nice with a dictator who is currently trying to delete the Constitution one right at a time.

Biden had a decent platform given how right leaning this country is, universal prek and universal college, but we don't have enough energy in the party to make that a reality.

"I think people are really misunderstanding this. It's not neoliberal center left democrats, or farther left progressive democrats, that people are looking for. I think their actual policy positions have very, very little to do with what people want. A good example is Trump's ""concepts of a plan"" on healthcare, an issue that often tops people's concerns in yet for many people who had healthcare as a top concern, they voted for Trump.   What people actually want is two-fold.   1. Someone who is willing to fight  2. Someone who is an effective communicator.   This can come from the center left or the far left, it actually doesn't matter. People like AOC and Bernie right now because they are communicating and fighting. People liked what Van Hollen did going to El Salvador because he was showing people that he is willing to fight. It didn't have anything to do with being closer or farther from the center. Similar to Cory Booker's filibuster it showed his willingness to fight. People also really like Pete Buttigieg right now, despite him being closer to the center, because he is such an effective communicator, even in very hostile media environments like Fox or right-leaning podcasts.   Personally, I'm a policy guy, I like clear, coherent policy that I think will be effective at solving certain issues. This is not how most voters, even democratic voters, think or vote. It has a lot more to do with the vibes. AOC really isn't even that far off from Kamala; she just puts more emphasis on economic justice, but from a ""here is what we should actually try to do"" standpoint, they are very similar. It's just packaged differently. That's what people want a shiny package that speaks to them, even if the contents are the same as that boring package the center-left Dems have been pushing, but explaining terribly.   I just think this fight over policy is a bit misguided, especially when we saw how successful Trump was with almost no policy to speak of, and what little policy he had, it was incoherent and all over the place.",unholyravenger,2025-04-24T12:19:50,1

Learn to multitask if you can’t. You can’t fix the mess without addressing both problems.

">  Those other orgs are not running the party.   You're right those other orgs have conveniently taken activities under the purview of the Democratic party and absconded with them, removing them from party oversight. Either primary neutrality is a principle of the Democratic party or it isn't.  The fact that you don't see how that's a problem and accuse people of using logical fallacies when you're the one who is ignoring the rank hypocrisy is kinda sad.

Cute. Keep calling out how pointing out convenient hypocrticial actions are somehow a logical fallacy.  Either the Democratic party apparatus should be neutral or it shouldn't.
