Good. An absolutely fucking preposterous piece of legislation.,StoppableHulk,2025-05-05T20:47:55,23
Blocking this bill doesn’t go far enough.  We should cut off all aid and arm sales to Israel.,AaminMarritza,2025-05-05T22:20:28,7

"Here is the beginning of the story:  Following online outrage from the right, the House canceled a planned vote on the [IGO Anti-Boycott Act](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/05/mike-lawler-josh-gottheimer-bds-anti-boycott-law/), legislation expanding current U.S. anti-boycott laws to include international organizations, despite broad bipartisan support for the legislation last year.  The fallout is just one recent example of how actors on the political fringes have mobilized to stymie pro-Israel legislation and bills to combat antisemitism that otherwise enjoy bipartisan support — often by misrepresenting their aims and impacts — and have ammassed sufficient influence to upend that bipartisan consensus and scuttle the legislative process.  The bill expands [current U.S. anti-boycott laws](https://jewishinsider.com/2022/10/commerce-department-arab-league-israel-boycott-american-jewish-committee/) first passed in the 1970s, primarily as a counter to the Arab League’s boycott of Israel. [Additional authorities](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ232/PLAW-115publ232.pdf) and guidelines were passed into law in 2018 under President Donald Trump. The existing law imposes penalties for companies or individuals which comply with or facilitate compulsory foreign boycotts of U.S. allies as a condition of doing business in foreign countries.   The new law would apply to potential boycott policies enforced by international organizations like the United Nations or European Union.  Bipartisan support for identical legislation last year was so strong that it passed the House by a voice vote in February 2024, after being [reported out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee by a 42-3 vote](https://jewishinsider.com/2023/12/house-foreign-affairs-committee-anti-boycott-laws-human-shields-terrorists/) in late 2023. But this year, it’s meeting a very different reception.  The legislation as written does not ban or criminalize boycotts of Israel by U.S. citizens or companies undertaken outside of compulsory policies by international organizations, nor does it punish Americans who do not purchase Israeli goods. Current law specifically states that “the mere absence of a business relationship” in the boycotted country is not sufficient evidence of a boycott under the law. But some on the right took to X on Sunday to claim otherwise.",jewish_insider,2025-05-05T20:43:56,-3
