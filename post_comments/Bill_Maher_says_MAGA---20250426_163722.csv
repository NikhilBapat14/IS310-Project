"My biggest disappointment in Trump's second term so far is... that it's still just Trump doing things. Where is the House and Senate? At this rate we're going to slide into the midterms and lose our thin majorities as the other Republicans, in typical fashion, do nothing with the power we've given them. Like him or hate him, at least Trump is out there trying to get things done. Our other republicans talk a great game and then when it's time to do stuff they sit on their hands.",Rush2201,2025-04-26T19:55:13,79

"The only thing I'm disappointed in is all the maneuvers by the left to block the things Trump was elected to do. What happened to ""elections have consequences"" and ""I have a pen and a phone"" that the Democrats assured us was democracy in action. Now it's a problem?",JustinCayce,2025-04-26T18:06:45,22

"I could be happier, but I am definitely not disappointed.   I am 110% disappointed in the rest of the government that is lagging behind and actively engaging in dereliction of duty, obstruction, and in some cases outright treason.      I can't believe how many horrible people are in this government, especially judges. DOJ has a serious corruption problem, not in DC per se, but in the whole judicial system there are tons of local judges on the take and they need to investigate their own.   The trust in the judicial system is nearly as low as congress, which is absolutely insane.",DRKMSTR,2025-04-26T17:32:09,8

"It's ONLY been 100 DAYS, Bill!     1.  I doubt anyone reaches all their goals in the first 100 days on their job... even WITHOUT a significant number of people gumming up the works.  2. Objectively, he has accomplished more in his first 100 days than any other President, including HIS first term.  3.  We aren't children, and we do not act like children, therefore, we have patience.  We do not expect humans to produce miracles.  We are willing to accept that Rome wasn't built in a day.  We recognize that issues HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED, and they ARE being addressed.

What am I supposed to be disappointed about?  I‚Äôm getting what I voted for in almost every headline.  The only thing I‚Äôm ambivalent on is tariffs. The only thing I‚Äôve been bothered by (because it‚Äôs stupid) is the Trump 2028 trolling.,esqadinfinitum,2025-04-26T17:47:24,-5

It's much too early for any firm judgement but most agree that the alternative would have been so much worse.   We will all need to wait to see how effective it's all been and if the chaos was all worth it.   In the meantime we remain cautiously optimistic.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-26T19:17:19,1

"How far in did Maher's proctologist have to reach to find that idea?   It's fascinating how liberals know what other people are thinking.  Trump voters regret their vote, based on a limited number of very dubious stories.  Hispanics want to be called Latinx, no matter how many Hispanics tell the libs no, we do not want our language screwed with.  But libs aren't elitists who know what all us dumb plebes need better than we know ourselves.",enslaved1,2025-04-26T21:12:44,-1
"I'm not disappointed. The biggest threat we face is Luciferian globalists. Trump is exceeding my expectations with how well he is smashing them.   To begin the Luciferian globalist rabbit hole and their agenda of global domination, research Lucis Trust, the Theosophical Society, and the works of Helena Blavatsky and Alice Bailey.   Secular globalism is a front for the institution of communist global Luciferian theocracy. Literally.",whippingboy4eva,2025-04-26T17:10:17,-17

"I'm disappointed so many activist judges have stalled out many of the initiatives Trump ran on and tried to implement. I'm disappointed Congress can't get their crap together and pass laws that don't require executive action to implement and don't have to worry about changing every term.

"Trump is his own worst enemy. Saying we'll take Canada and Greenland at our leisure, and renig on the Panama Canal aren't great for international relations. I'm also worried that we are going to waste away our majority without anything actually being accomplished opening up the opportunity to lose a majority in the House or Senate thus making things infinitely harder the 2nd half.

Basically what it comes down to. Trump has been good for some things but raises questions on others. Going so hard on Tariffs after inheriting Biden's economy isn't a good optic. There is no doubt Kamala would've been a trainwreck.,mahvel50,2025-04-26T20:08:58,1

The tariffs are still an unknown for me. Maybe it's similar where we get positive results after a lot of headlines and overreactions. There are several policies I disagree with, I'd love to cut back on H1Bs and spend less money to get back to a true balanced budget, but I'd never say I wish I didn't vote for him considering the alternative. Remember the Dems claiming our border was closed, while saying the only reason it couldn't be fixed is because Congress (via Trump) didn't pass the crazy border bill? Yet with the stroke of a pen via executive action we've finally stopped the vast majority of illegal immigration proving Biden/Harris could have done this at any point in time.",dire76,2025-04-27T11:22:02,3
