The stupidity of the MAGA people calling him a Marxist pope assumes that the USA is the entire focus of Catholicism.  Self centered idiots thinking that a religion nearly 8 times as old as the USA itself should submit to its “values” because this party got in charge.  Idiots,Lucky-old-boy,2025-05-09T14:13:50,22
"Roman Catholics in America have a long history of left-leaning social positions (aside from abortion).    It would be interesting to hijack their leftist inclinations and use the Catholic Church against the demons that represent MAGA.  We could demand that public schools teach charity for the poor, and good will toward all of God's creatures, even immigrants.   I wonder how fast MAGA would demand separation of church and state. ____________________________________________________  The Church has a long tradition of supporting the poor and marginalized, with involvement in various social justice movements on the left.  It's been involved in the labor movement, advocating for workers' rights and fair wages.  Many prominent figures in the Civil Rights Movement were Catholic and played a big role in advocating for equality and racial justice. It's also been involved in peace movements and anti-war activism, challenging military interventions.",insuproble,2025-05-09T13:53:18,15
"""Love thy immigrant as your own...""  I don't consider myself religious, and even I know the verse. Immigration is good for the economy, especially when you economy is over-run with stupid people who who think they know everything even though they didn't do good in school.  It is the anti-intelligence mentality that is pervasive in our society. People just refuse to learn about anything while they claim themselves an expert at everything.",ExtremeModerate2024,2025-05-09T14:01:04,8
"**From Clarissa-Jan Lim, breaking/trending news writer for MSNBC Digital:**  As Cardinal Robert Prevost, Leo had posted an article from National Catholic Reporter in February that rebutted Vance’s interpretation of a Catholic theological concept, “ordo amoris,” as a hierarchy of Christian love. Days later, he shared on X an article from America Magazine that was critical of Trump’s immigration policies and the rhetoric demonizing migrants.  His last public activity on X was in April, when he reposted an essay from Bishop Evelio Menjivar, an auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, who condemned the administration’s legally questionable immigration enforcement tactics.  As his social media posts made the rounds, several prominent MAGA influencers spoke out against the new papal leader. Far-right conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer, who has Trump’s ear, wrote a series of posts trashing the pope, including one calling him “anti-Trump, anti-MAGA, pro-open Borders, and a total Marxist like Pope Francis.”  Read more: [https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/maga-world-pope-leo-xiv-criticizes-trump-immigration-rcna205806](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/maga-world-pope-leo-xiv-criticizes-trump-immigration-rcna205806)",msnbc,2025-05-09T13:48:21,4

So conservatives hated the last pope and they’ll hate this pope for the same reasons but they can’t stand the fact that he criticized their fascist policies?  Conservatives are hypocritical weaklings.,wiscopup,2025-05-09T18:05:24,1

Any many ways the turn from John Paul and Benedict to Francis was because lots of Cardinals didn't like how the social disputes of conservative Catholics in Europe and the US were dominating the Church.
