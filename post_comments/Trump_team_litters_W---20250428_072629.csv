Honestly they need to just come out and say they hate all us brown people and be done with the bs. Everyone knows it and his supporters voted for him because of it.

"Are you starting to realize that Trump is acting according to the whims of about 20% of the US population, and all the rest of us can just go to hell?  And needless to say, since none of these people got due process, they just slapped charges up there randomly.  Just take a jaunt over to one of the Republican subs to see the Bizarro world these people live in. You'd think that Anonymous would have taken the initiative to hack these subs so that only posts grounded in actual reality showed up.

Once again proving that conservatives believe in anecdotal evidence rather than statistics.   Sure you can find immigrants that have committed crimes but immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US born Americans.,TheHomieAbides,2025-04-28T10:39:02,1
"How about all the pics of white politicians and clergy arrested for the exact same shit? The fact that they are illegal immigrants is irrelevant, they make up a very small percentage of the overall statistics on these crimes.  Yes, bad crimes.

"I know Trump's previous administration didn't deport many more people than past administration, the news covering it just makes it look like it was better.  Between the news covering the deportations and democrats complaining about his abuses, it's no surprise that illegal immigrants came to the US less under a Trump administration.  Conversely,  with the republicans complaining that the border was wide open under the Biden administration despite it not being that much more open than under the Trump administration led many immigrants to believe it was easy to get into the US under the Biden administration.  Hence people came in illegally in higher numbers under the Biden administration.",nedrith,2025-04-28T08:37:17,1
