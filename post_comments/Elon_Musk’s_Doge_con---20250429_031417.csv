"That's okay, let's give him access to information regarding our nuclear arsenal. Everything will be fine:  [DOGE employees gain accounts on classified networks holding nuclear secrets](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/28/nx-s1-5378684/doge-energy-department-nuclear-secrets-access?renderplatform=nprone_ios&unified=true)  >Two members of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency were given accounts on classified networks that hold highly guarded details about America's nuclear weapons, two sources tell NPR.   ...   In a second statement later Monday evening, the spokesperson clarified that the accounts had been created but said they were never used by the DOGE staffers. ""DOE is able to confirm that these accounts in question were never activated and have never been accessed,"" the email statement read.  It's not like DOGE is already compromised:  [NLRB whistleblower claims Musk’s DOGE potentially caused significant security breach](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/nlrb-whistleblower-claims-musks-doge-potentially-caused-significant-security-breach)  >Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were ""near real-time,"" according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-29T03:35:29,9
"> Elon Musk and his companies face at least $2.37bn in legal exposure from federal investigations, litigation and regulatory oversight, according to a new report from Senate Democrats. The report attempts to put a number to Musk’s many conflicts of interest through his work with his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), warning that he may seek to use his influence to avoid legal liability.  > The report, which was published on Monday by Democratic members of the Senate homeland security committee’s permanent subcommittee on investigations, looked at 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 separate agencies. Investigators calculated the financial liabilities Musk and his companies, such as Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, may face in 45 of those actions.  > Since Donald Trump won re-election last year and Musk took on the role of de facto head of Doge in January, ethics watchdogs and Democratic officials have warned that the Tesla CEO could use his power to oust regulators and quash investigations into his companies. In the role, Musk, the richest man in the world, holds sway over agencies that regulate or contract with his companies. The subcommittee report outlines the extent of Musk’s liabilities, which include potentially facing $1.19bn in fines to Tesla alone over allegations it made false or misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.",Araminal,2025-04-29T03:16:19,8

"Has he avoided legal liability?   I'd say he created much more.  We're just getting started on this Adolf-wannabe, as is the rest of the globe, which is also bringing legal actions.  His exposure is enormous, and after just 3 months he's shrinking like an echo - INCLUDING losses exacerbated  by Trump tariffs.  The businesses that made Leon rich are in a deep dive.  He's reporting govt credits in the profit column!  The only activity he is sticking to - DOGE - is the activity that'll total him.  Don't forget he paid $290million for that job!  American Tyrants always think they're untouchable, until they aren't.  He made himself into America's kicking post, and - no matter how many $million bribes he tries -- Leon has no redeeming qualities.  I'd say let's keep these investigations and reports coming - I'm sure just reading the title makes LumpFace Leon poop his new Trump diapers.  Trump's gangster DoJ ain't gonna save Leon.  They're big talk, because Trump loves big mouths.  Yet Trump's biggest lackeys generally end up in prison.  How long did Trump's other AG's last?  No one  even remember their names, just their bias, and Trump's hate-campaigns against them after they carried water for his crooked campaigns.  So how long will this ""Karen"" AG last?  Let's just say NO TRUMP AG has lasted 4 years.  At the end of the day, Leon's US legal problems will FAR outlive Trump's AG \_and\_ DoJ \_and\_ Trump.  Leon is getting cancelled, and nothing Trump can do will save him.  Trump wouldn't try to save him anyway -- bc Trump is in it for Trump.  The wannabes around him - no matter how credentialed or rich - ALWAYS go up in flames.  But I DO AGREE the rest of us need to back up our words with action:  >“Anything less than decisive, immediate, and collective action risks America becoming a bystander to the surrender to modern oligarchy.”",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-29T04:17:35,2
