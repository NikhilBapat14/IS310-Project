"As an educator for 30 yrs I would like to point out that the DOE plays a crucial role for Kids with Special Needs - everything from learning disabilities, ADHD, Developmental Delays, Autism, Speech and Language deficits, to severe Cognitive Delays that leave kids nonverbal and in need of very specialized care. For example we had a student recently that was nonverbal and would suddenly dart away and hit someone. He required three full time staff to keep everyone safe.  Helping all those kids requires standards and costs ALOT of money. The State and Local Communities are already doing their part and funding basic education but many schools still work with a deficit- my point is that without DOE it will be the most needy kids that will suffer- they are the kids that private schools will exclude,(they would consider them a weight on test scores).  I do have issues with the standardized tests, they are stressors for everyone and have taken the joy out of school. The tests could also be why absenteeism is so high. I don’t mean because of the actual test, but because of the pressure the teachers and students feel EVERYDAY to jam as much into their brains as possible to prepare for it-there is no time for fun anymore.",DIYQUEEN14,2024-09-04T02:40:09,4

"The short answer is that it doesn't serve any significant purpose.  K-12 schools are nearly entirely funded on the state and local levels, the DOE cannot set curriculum, and the minimal guidance they do offer is generally controversial and wholly unnecessary.  Arguably the only good it does is the Pell Grant and student loan administration, neither of which needs to be handled by a cabinet-level agency.  Combine that with the lack of education support being a constitutional power and a better question would be why anyone is so hell-bent on retaining it.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2024-09-03T09:44:01,10
"I’m a leftist and I actually support substantially scaling down parts of the DoEd. I believe it has done so much damage to public education simply because it’s uses a top-down, anti-worker model that harms a system that works best from the bottom-up: from teachers, students, and parents (the “workers” so to speak).  I do understand that DoEd traffics in a variety of functions (student loans, rights for special needs students, etc.), and I don’t explicitly dispute the value in those. But the function of DoED that does the most damage is the “data collection” branch. This is where the test-addiction ideology arises and why the purpose, passion, joy, and curiosity has been sucked out of learning. The reason being is that they are trying to “be accountable to the public” but they are measuring useless information.   The measure of a good education system are the immeasurable outcomes—can US society run a democracy? Are people literate? Are citizens civic-minded and engaged with the common good? Do institutions run effectively or efficiently due to critically thinking citizens? Are workplaces functional, safe, and efficient? Are citizens creative, inventive, and innovative? Do citizens self-regulate population through rational reproduction? Are parents/families capable of self-governing? Does the public value cooperation for the benefit of the whole? Do we see collectivism, community-building, unions, associations, etc? Do we see positive health outcomes? Do we see health life choices? Are we producing experts, scientists, intellectuals, professionals, etc who expand human knowledge? Is crime at manageable levels? Are prison populations low? Do children progress and grow following predictive life-histories? Do we see equality and equity in every level of societal organization? Citizen happiness, life satisfaction, quality of life etc.  This list could go on and on. The reality is that the DoEd (and actually, along with the individual state education systems who repeat the same functions) waste time and money collecting metrics that intend to measure achievement, but actually just result in the system adjusting to meet the metrics (Goodhart's Law).  Sadly, the right does not have good intentions with their plan to abolish the DoEd, as their goal is privatization, indoctrination, and social control. They don’t care about the positive immeasurables of a healthy society because they just want further enrich the elite class.",Colzach,2024-09-03T20:48:11,3
"1.  There is no enumerated power of Congress to fund public education - that is a role of the states.  2.  Education is best handled more locally, closer to the parents of the children being educated.  3.  Federalism supports both #1 & #2.  4.  The feds waste a ton of money just on administration alone.  Better not to take it from the states / people in the first place.",RingAny1978,2024-09-03T16:36:18,3
"Personally I would look at what happens to the money currently funding the Dept of Education.  With Republicans it usually comes back to public money being spent and instead either wanting that money to go to private hands so that profit can be made from it, or else to then cut taxes on the wealthy and corporations.  Currently it looks like public education has increasingly been set up to fail with things like Bush's ""No child left behind"" policy and so public education money has been able to flow more to private schools instead.  There is also conservative backlash over the federal gov enforcing some equality standards in funding education and so removing the Dept of Education could potentially allow states to discriminate more against people for race, gender, sexual orientation/identity, and immigration status.  Currently that seems like a very desirable things for conservatives.",ptwonline,2024-09-03T10:54:29,4
"A lot of the comments disregard centrists and leftists who support abolishing the DoE. There are many reasons that people who support its demise, including subpar standards/outcomes (compared to private), as well as the governmental influence on a young person's ideology. There is no such thing as an objective education, and many parents are unhappy with at least one thing that their children are taught in school.   There are definitely more people on the right who want it gone, but it isn't a right-wing thing only. Most of the people that I know who support getting rid of it are parents or educators (but not all of them).",BetterEveryDayYT,2024-09-03T15:50:40,3

"The US has 335M people.  The Senate is 100 members.  The average Senator represents over 3 million individuals.  They can't really be that responsive to the individual constituents, the numbers are simply too big.  Average state is 6.7M people.  If a state legislature has 100-ish members, each member represents only 67k people.  They could conceivably talk to all those people at once in person (in a big stadium).  This means everything that can feasibly be done at the state level, should.  It makes the government more democratic and responsive to the people.  Also, states can't print money.  That means they have to be somewhat responsible with taxes and spending.  Lower levels of government have better structure in place to avoid wasteful or excessive spending.  Things like foreign policy, declaring war on other countries, or resolving disputes between states?  That kinda has to be done at a national level, by definition.  Everything else should be left up to the states.  ""Everything else"" includes things like healthcare and education.  That's the viewpoint of classical small-government conservatives, anyway.  Some other concerns include that basically more national control of education means schools are forced to follow policies people don't agree with.  For example:  - Allowing boys to play in girls'  sports and vice versa when students are transgender - Not keeping parents informed if students exhibit concerning behavior, like requesting different pronouns - Teaching things they don't agree with (classically, evolution falls in this category) - Not teaching things they do agree with (religious Christian education) - Teaching students to hate themselves (if they're white males) - Teaching students to hate their country by teaching a lot about the bad things the USA did (e.g. ""the USA should be ashamed because of how we treated the Native Americans or the founding fathers being all white men and some of them owning slaves"") - Not teaching students enough about the good things the USA did (""the Founding Fathers helped the world transition away from 'The king should be in charge because he's just born to be better than everyone else' to 'All men are created equal, a government only rules by the will of the people and the consent of the governed'"") - Using Common Core standards (it's different than how older generations learned so it's harder for parents to understand / help with homework)",white_nerdy,2024-09-05T14:34:21,1
It doesn't really do that much stuff and the stuff that it does can be replaced by state processes.   What I'm more curious about is what the actual plan for public ed and charters is. Will ESSA be replaced if Trump is elected?,[deleted],2024-09-11T05:27:49,1
Two questions:    1.  Are we demonstrably better and  more efficient now at educating our youth relative to economically important competitor nations than we were in prior to the Dept’s creation?  2.  Has the department successfully led us to a place where our young as a group are learning more complex concepts in useful subjects earlier than in prior periods?  Any answer to either needs to account for the large and growing percentage of engineers and scientists at the graduate level and in American industry that are not from here.,SpiceyMugwumpMomma,2024-09-04T11:29:17,1

Sucks if you live in a red oligarchy state with a lot of poverty. Our schools are funded by property tax and the federal funding is allocated to poor areas to help balance it out and give kids a fair chance. Red states already receive more federal funding than they pay to the federal government. Our private and charter schools around here give off white supremacy vibes. They are very strict about who they let in and often very religious.,artstartraveler,2024-11-17T12:46:04,3
"See, this is seen as a right-wing position but I fully agree with it as a leftist. Education is worse the further it gets from the teachers, parents, and students. Even at district levels it gets too messy, bureaucratic, and dysfunctional. This is why I advocate bottom-up systems, not top-down.",Colzach,2024-09-03T20:51:19,3

"This is a fairly bad faith take on their position, and you're missing the forest for the trees. First, your explanation is projecting the beliefs of a very particular brand of Republican (racist evangelical christians) onto all Republicans, which is not accurate. Many Republicans would disagree with most, if not all, of the items in your list.  Second, you're completely omitting the fundamental argument against the elimination of the DOE - allowing local communities to control school curriculums rather than federal government bureaucrats. Allowing a handful of political elites in Washington DC to overrule parents' wishes and force specific curriculums onto children across the country is a recipe political polarization at best and totalitarianism at worst.  You're likely only in favor of the DOE because your faction is currently in control of it. If evangelical Christians were in charge of the DOE, you would likely want it to be abolished as well.",luckoftheblirish,2024-09-03T13:26:18,-1

"You started off very objective, which is refreshing. Then, it quickly became a rant that I've never been able to understand.  ""Teaching students to hate themselves (if they're white males)."" Yeah, because seeing 44 white men out of 45 presidents will definitely make them hate themselves. Seeing that the founding fathers of our country are white men will surely do it. There are plenty of good things about the US talked about in textbooks, but we can't just ignore the bad.  This mindset reflects a misunderstanding of the intention behind teaching about history, social issues, and systemic inequalities. The primary goal of teaching these things is not to instill self-hatred, but rather to encourage critical thinking, historical awareness and contexts, and a more accurate understanding of society's complexities.   Learning about the history of oppression doesn't equate to blaming or shaming individuals today. It's about recognizing how historical events shaped the present and reminding ourselves of a place we should never return to as a means of always moving forward. Learning about social injustices to marginalized groups such as African and Native Americans isn't about making white males feel bad. It's about fostering empathy and understanding, which are crucial for creating a more compassionate and equitable society.  White males are privileged. I don't say that to condemn white males. I'm just highlighting a systemic advantage. If hearing that statement gives a white male the ick and it makes them hate themselves, then they are making themselves a victim to ""reverse racism.""  And of course, I'm not saying ALL white males have it easy. It's just that when you compare them to other demographics in the US, in most categories, they do.   Lessons taught in school should be complete and comprehensive. Intentionally leaving out facts to make a group feel better is taking a step backward. Germany is responsible for SYSTEMIC GENOCIDE and they extensively teach about this in their schools. Sounds like if you were a German, you would think they are teaching you to hate yourself.  Conservatives calling liberals sensitive is so incredibly ironic when they themselves get so worked up about topics surrounding immigration, gun control, abortion, and secularism. Is it not sensitive of a white male to hate themselves after learning about the injustices done to others? Can we just call it what it is: having a strong and passionate opinion?  With education becoming more state based, I'm only afraid of the country being further divided and the standard of education being further deviated. This is only common sense. Imagine a strong right-wing state's educational system and then a strong left-wing state's. Now, imagine how the adults leaving these education systems will think of each other. Is it not obvious that there will be far less understanding, more hatred, and more division? Local control can have some benefits like you mentioned. But done incorrectly, and it could also exacerbate divisions on issues of race, identity, and social injustices, ultimately making it more difficult to bridge these gaps in an increasingly polarized nation. There will always be a need for core educational values. And finally, private schools exist. If you want your child to learn that evolution isn't real, climate change isn't real, slavery isn't really as important as making sure the white male ego isn't tainted, women should be forced carry out their pregnancy, or whatever you believe in, then try to find a school that aligns with your beliefs. Or better yet, quit your job and homeschool your kids to ensure they get the best conservative education they could possibly get.",Agreeable-Grab2898,2024-12-12T12:30:46,1
