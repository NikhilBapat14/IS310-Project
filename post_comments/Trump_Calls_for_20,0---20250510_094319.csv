"This is it exactly.  They are fighting a 1970's perceived enemy all while being completely incompetent to cyber threats.  Even worse, they have completely miscalculated the threat of complex legacy software systems that require human expertise.

The damage for these is deep and reaches almost every American.  Death of a thousand cuts as they say.",fastautomation,2025-05-10T10:09:39,1
