"Automakers and tech developers testing and deploying [self-driving](https://www.wired.com/tag/self-driving-cars/) and advanced driver assistance features will no longer have to report as much detailed, public crash information to the federal government, according to a new framework released today by the US Department of Transportation.  The moves are a boon for makers of self-driving cars and the wider vehicle technology industry, which has complained that federal crash reporting requirements are overly burdensome and redundant. But the new rules will limit the information available to those who watchdog and study autonomous vehicles and driver assistance features—tech developments that are deeply entwined with public safety but which companies often shield from public view because they involve proprietary systems that companies spend billions to develop.  The new rules allow companies to shield from public view some crash details, including the automation version involved in incidents and the “narratives” around the crashes, on the grounds that such information contains “confidential business information.” Self-driving vehicle developers, such as Waymo and Zoox, will no longer need to report crashes that include property damage less than $1,000, if the incident doesn’t involve the self-driving car crashing on its own or striking another vehicle or object.  And in a change, the makers of advanced driver assistance features, such as Full Self-Driving, only have to report crashes if they result in fatalities, hospitalizations, air bag deployments, or a strike on a ""vulnerable road user,” like a pedestrian or cyclist—but no longer have to report the crash if the vehicle involved just needs to be towed.
