This already happened in the 2000s when the patriot act was passed. Fact is trump wouldn’t be a big threat if the president and government hadn’t gained so much power after the 2000s. But people still want to say trump is worse than bush. Bush was able to pass the patriot act because he was an actual politician who did it with bipartisan support. Bush built most of the problem we have today. Trump is just a symptom of it. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-01T08:00:58,15

Start writing down what life used to be like so younger generations will know that this is not normal.

" >But the deeper problem is that the Privacy Act lacks real teeth. It did not give judges the ability to levy meaningful fines or easily halt illegal actions. It failed to establish an enforcement arm to investigate privacy violations in ways that courts can’t. And since then, Congress hasn’t been able to pass comprehensive privacy laws or create stronger enforcement mechanisms.  >That makes the United States the only country in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development without a data protection agency to enforce comprehensive privacy laws. In the European Union, each country has a dedicated data protection authority that can conduct investigations, write rules, issue fines and even demand a halt to data processing. ...  >To pick just two recent examples: Last month DOGE bullied its way into the federal payroll records for about 276,000 federal workers, placing the officials who objected on administrative leave, and this month a separate whistle-blower at the National Labor Relations Board came forward with evidence showing that after DOGE workers arrived, there was a spike in data being siphoned out of the agency.  >“In no other country could a person like Elon Musk rummage through government databases and gather up the personal data of government employees, taxpayers and veterans,” said Marc Rotenberg, a longtime privacy lawyer and founder of the Center for A.I. and Digital Policy, a nonprofit research group. “There are many U.S. privacy laws. But they are only effective when enforced by dedicated privacy agencies.”",SicilyMalta,2025-05-01T08:06:37,5

"One step closer to the social credit score system. ""You will never have to vote again"" DJT         below is from the Google AI  A social credit score is a system used in China to evaluate the trustworthiness of individuals, businesses, and government entities. It's essentially a credit score based on various factors like financial creditworthiness, but also includes aspects like social behavior, honesty, and compliance with laws. A high score can lead to benefits like easier access to loans and public services, while a low score may result in restrictions. Here's a more detailed look:  * \*\*Purpose:\*\*The social credit system aims to promote a culture of trust and responsibility within society.  * \*\*How it works:\*\*It's a comprehensive system that considers a wide range of data points, including financial data, social behavior, and adherence to regulations.  * \*\*Impact:\*\*A high social credit score can lead to benefits like easier access to loans, better employment opportunities, and preferential treatment in various public services.  * \*\*Potential drawbacks:\*\*Critics have raised concerns about the potential for abuse, the lack of transparency, and the possibility of the system being used for political control.  * \*\*Evolution:\*\*The social credit system is constantly evolving, with ongoing efforts to expand its scope and enhance its functionality.  * \*\*Global context:\*\*While China's system is the most prominent example, similar concepts are being explored in other countries, often in the context of financial credit and digital currencies. ",SmedlyB,2025-05-01T09:36:29,1

Frat Boy Bush was just a tool.  The Patriot act was passed because people were TERRIFIED after 911and the Republicans kept the drumbeats going FEAR!

"I read Handmaid's Tale years back. Always enjoy a good dystopian thriller. I know the author  actually used events that took place in the real world for every event that took   place in her book.    Did I think it could happen? Well, sure, maybe - 100 years from now .   Never ever ever did I dream that this would all happen this fast. I would have called people conspiracy theorists if they suggested it.   In just three months the president of the United States has told the courts to kiss his ass, and the attorney general has said she will refuse to arrest anyone in the administration for contempt of court. People are being disappeared.  They are showing up at their nationalization interview and are being picked up and detained. It's insane.   And Bondi, Hesgeth , many others are part of very creepy Christian Nationalist groups. Trump has established a ""RELIGIOUS LIBERTY "" commission. Remember 1984 -  the room called the Room of Love was the room where they tortured dissidents.    Religious Liberty commission will be the Sharia Law commission.
