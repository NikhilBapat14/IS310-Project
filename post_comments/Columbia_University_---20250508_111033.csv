keep protesting. ignore the bootlickers,ponyflip,2025-05-08T11:19:00,21
"Wild how fast things escalated. Regardless of where you stand, it's pretty unsettling to see this happening on college campuses. Feels like we're watching a major shift in how protests are being handled.",careerguidebyjudy,2025-05-08T11:37:08,8

This is fascism.  Dissent is destroyed and now knowledge is restricted so it can't fuel further dissent.,dbag3o1,2025-05-08T11:41:12,12

"As someone who votes right and supports Israel, I'm always happy when I see this kind of stuff -- especially when it degenerates into vandalism and mindless thuggery. You couldn't ask for better messaging, or less attractive messengers. It's like gold dust.",Mikec3756orwell,2025-05-08T22:54:35,0
Columbia has every right to do this. They are not obligated to entertain these agitators on their private property. ,anticixx2,2025-05-08T11:13:48,-16
"> U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the protest, saying the federal government will be reviewing the visa status of the trespassers and vandals who took over the school's campus library in Morningside Heights.",box-cable,2025-05-08T11:12:35,-17

In what way did this event restrict knowledge?,wifeofsonofswayze,2025-05-08T11:58:16,-1
No it's not fascism. You do not have a right to protest in private campus buildings.,Scarlettail,2025-05-08T11:51:13,-7

"Lol when its people protesting things you don't like its ""private property"" and when its conservatives college's become ""public sqaures"" that are compelled to allow any speech (GW Bush was the one who popularized the idea on the right)... which is it?",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-08T11:48:19,4
That is true. They are also free to deal with the consequences. Their reputation is already in free-fall and their continued fall will impact admissions and donations.  Becoming the Hillsdale College Manhattan Extension Campus isn't exactly a winning strategy.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-08T11:32:19,10
"*Especially* during exams, when everyone is just trying to study in peace.  Maybe this is an overreaction on my part, but I would have been terrified by dozens of people storming into the library wearing face coverings and carrying backpacks/bags.",wifeofsonofswayze,2025-05-08T11:30:13,-3

"Fascism is incredibly disruptive to public life. It’s only fair to meet them at their level. “When they go low, we go high” is the reason we’re in this mess in the first place.",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-08T14:16:30,2

I never argued your latter point. ,anticixx2,2025-05-08T11:50:32,-2
I doubt this will affect that. ,anticixx2,2025-05-08T11:38:48,-4
those foreign agitators who are infiltrating Columbia's campus are going to care when they find their visas revoked.,box-cable,2025-05-08T11:18:35,-26
Newsflash: occupying a university library while students are trying to study for final exams isn't going to do a damn thing to help your cause.,wifeofsonofswayze,2025-05-08T14:38:00,5
ya..... these protests have done nothing but lost Columbia a lot of money from the federal goverment. Violent/vandalous protests in this country will not convince Israel to end the war in Gaza. Even without US support they do what they want. All these kinds of protests do is disrupt and cause chaos and give pro-Palestinian supporters a bad name. Peaceful ones without causing chaos are much more effective.,Character-Cow-9539,2025-05-08T14:47:53,1
neither have disruptive ones.,Redditthedog,2025-05-08T16:39:38,1

That's a weird thing to suggest considering admissions have already started declining. You can ignore reality if you'd like but it doesn't make it not real.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-08T11:57:06,5
Are you one of those uneducated Trumpers who don't know that 1A applies to everyone?,stinkywrinkly,2025-05-08T11:20:33,8
