">His first marriage to his high school sweetheart Meredith Schwarz ended with her claims that he serially cheated on her, including with Samantha Deering, the woman he married soon after and with whom he had three children.  >That second marriage then ended after Hegseth hooked up with Rauchet, a producer on Fox & Friends.   >She, too, was married at the time – to real estate executive Dennis Rauchet, with whom she has three kids.   >She got pregnant with Hegseth's baby soon after he transitioned from making frequent appearances on the show to co-hosting it in 2017.  >The daughter they share, Gwen, was born shortly before Hegseth was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman while attending a Republican women's conference in October of that year.   >A police report in Monterey, California, shows that his accuser was having champagne with co-workers when things got 'fuzzy' and she later found herself in a room with Hegseth.  >Although he claimed the encounter was consensual and no criminal charges were filed, he decided to pay the woman $50,000 rather than fight her allegations in court.   Wow, what a great husband he is.",A_Tang,2025-04-25T08:41:49,147
