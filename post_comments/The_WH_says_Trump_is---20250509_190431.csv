We decided we fully trusted any random appointed person in the government to mete out life and death on their whims with no oversight, no recourse, and no guilt.

"You're right, but from the inside it's worth understanding that most people I knew, and most people they knew, believed most of us wanted to do the right things. We'd watch the nation fall short of our ideals again and again, but with the belief that we were trying to get better, and that the vast majority truly wanted to do better and be on the side of good in the world.  That view is fully shattered, even internally. And not  just for the people who are against MAGA -- the MAGA people themselves are bold and proud that they are not trying to be good. It used to be that the people pushing hurtful policy had some underlying explanation that they were working for the greater good in some ham-handed way, but there is no longer any pretense. They are openly hostile to justice and truth and anything of the sort.  So ""you never were"" hides a horrible transformation that has taken place. Before we were like a violent drug addict that struggled with themselves and tried rehab, had bouts of clarity and compassion, and cried for the people he hurt. Now we're hardened criminal that says ""Fuck it. i'm gonna take what i want and if you get in my way you're nothing to me.
