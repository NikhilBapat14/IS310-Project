">For months, the Trump administration has fended off legal challenges to DOGE’s sweeping interventions in federal governance by insisting that neither DOGE nor its de facto leader, Elon Musk, have real decision-making authority. The common refrain—expressed in court filings, sworn statements, and depositions—is that DOGE merely advises agencies on which contracts to slash or which personnel to lay off en masse. According to the government, it’s ultimately up to the relevant agency officials to decide whether to act on DOGE’s recommendations.  >It’s a convenient narrative. As a matter of legal strategy, the idea that DOGE merely advises rather than directs agency decision-making is a key part of the government’s defense in litigation alleging violations of the Appointments Clause.  In other cases, the government has argued that DOGE is not an “agency” subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because its role is limited to advising and assisting the president.  It's smells like bitch in here dot jaypeg  >To be sure, there’s already a voluminous body of public evidence–from Trump and Musk’s own statements to court documents to media reporting on DOGE’s activities–contradicting the government’s claim that DOGE is an advisory entity. But much of that evidence, while compelling, is circumstantial or based on “social media posts and news reports,” as one appeals court recently complained.  >All of which has enabled government officials and lawyers to make dubious claims about DOGE while maintaining a veneer, albeit a thin one, of plausible deniability.  >But a new court filing reveals the most compelling evidence yet that the government has been spinning a fiction in federal court.  The article came with receipts. Like tea is being spilled, but they're professionals so any shade being thrown will be between the lines. Let's get the background info:  >The underlying case, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights v. United States Department of Justice, was brought by a network of legal aid groups that subcontract with the Acacia Center for Justice, which provides legal services for non-citizens and unaccompanied minor children.  >The legal aid groups first sued back in January, after the Justice Department issued a “stop work” order for the programs, citing Trump’s “Protecting the People Against Invasion” executive order. Shortly after the plaintiffs filed suit, the Justice Department rescinded the “stop work” order. Then, days later, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memorandum directing the Justice Department to review—and, potentially, terminate—all contracts with organizations “that support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.” The legal aid groups moved to block the Justice Department from terminating its contracts based on Bondi’s memorandum.  >On March 17, Judge Randolph Moss of the District Court for the District of Columbia held a hearing on the plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction. Judge Moss indicated that, because there was no pause or termination of the funding at that time, he was inclined to hold the motion under consideration pending any future action taken by the Justice Department. Later that day, **the judge entered an order requiring the Justice Department to provide the plaintiffs “with at least three business days’ notice before suspending or terminating” any of the funding at issue.**  Emphasis mine. Now put on your big red nose and clown shoes, you're going to need protection when you visit the circus.   >All of which brings me to DOGE and the events that occurred at the Justice Department on April 3 and beyond. The excessively detailed account of those events presented below is based on administrative records, including internal Justice Department emails and documents, that were recently filed by the government in the Amica litigation. **The new details contained therein, which have garnered little attention, suggest that DOGE directed senior Justice Department officials to terminate the Acacia Center’s contracts.**   >On the morning of April 3, around 9:00 a.m., a contracting officer at the Justice Management Division—the administrative arm of the Justice Department—sent an email to Christina Burghard, a staffer at the Executive Office of Immigration Review, which administers the Acacia Center’s programs. Citing one of Trump’s DOGE executive orders, the contracting officer informed Burghard that she had “received instructions to freeze all contracts starting March 29, 2025 and moving forward unless the award is considered ‘mission essential.’” Burghard then forwarded the instructions to colleagues in her division, along with a list of Acacia Center contracts that “[apply] to this directive.”  >Later that evening, at 6:06 p.m., a Justice Management Division staffer named Tarak Makecha received an email from an official at the General Services Administration, an external agency.   >Subject: “Acacia.”  >Makecha, a former Tesla employee, has previously been identified as a DOGE associate by multiple media outlets. He has been linked to DOGE work at the Office of Personnel Management, the State Department, the FBI, and now the Justice Management Division at the Justice Department.  >The sender of the “Acacia” email was Josh Gruenbaum, the Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration. Gruenbaum, like Makecha, has been linked to DOGE. He recently made headlines after he sent a blistering letter to corporate consulting firms that contract with the federal government.   This is what I mean when I say this article has receipts, it comes with evidence about the who, where, what, when, why and how this is connected to DOGE.  I can't quote the entire article at you, just let me cherry-pick the parts I like.  >“See attached,” Makecha wrote to Taylor and others at 6:25 p.m. “Please execute this termination today and please forward me the termination email to confirm it went out so I can report completion to WH.”  >Makecha did not identify who he would “report completion to” at the White House. Notably, however, Musk is employed as a “senior advisor” at the White House.  >Also at the White House is Amy Gleason, the alleged acting administrator of the US DOGE Service. Gleason has previously claimed that she does not supervise DOGE associates who are employed at federal agencies. And though Trump’s DOGE executive order concerning government contracts requires an agency’s “DOGE Team Lead” to provide the administrator with a monthly informational report, it’s not clear if Makecha is the designated “DOGE Team Lead” at the Justice Department. According to The Intercept, he is listed in Justice Department staff records as an “advisor” to the office of the chief information officer, which oversees IT and cybersecurity for the department.  >**Additionally, nothing in the DOGE executive order empowers a DOGE Team Lead to unilaterally direct the termination of agency contracts.**  Emphasis mine.   >At 7:22 p.m., Taylor wrote to his boss, Jolene Lauria, the Assistant Attorney General for Administration:  >>Jolene – I don’t think we can accomplish what he’s asking. For one, we don’t have CO’s available to log in and cancel contracts at this time of night. Second, he is asking us to cancel a contract that may have a temporary restraining order according to EOIR. I haven’t seen the TRO to confirm its existence but Tarak argues doesn’t preclude DOJ from terminating the contract for convenience. [REDACTED]. I am being rushed to act by Tarak who is calling me as I type this message.  >In its filing, the Justice Department redacted part of Taylor’s email without explanation.  I'm a huge SCP fan, but even I get tired of [REDACTED] jokes.   >At 7:48 p.m., the contracting officer, Polizzi, sent a termination notice to the Acacia Center—apparently using her iPhone to do so.  >The termination letter attached to Polizzi’s email purported to cancel the Acacia Center’s contracts “effective April 3,” stating that its services “are no longer needed.” Bizarrely, though the notice was purportedly sent from a Justice Department officer on departmental letterhead, the meta-data showed that the document was titled “Application for VOA journalist credential,” according to an amended complaint filed by the Amica plaintiffs.  It's all so stupid, a signature characteristic of the Trump admin.  >Nearly an hour later, Sirce Owen, the acting director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review, **apparently remained unaware of the fact that the contract had been cancelled.** In an 8:45 p.m. email sent on April 3, Owen instructed staffers to “notify Acacia immediately that we are terminating their contract as of 11:59 pm. E.S.T., Tuesday, April 8, 2025.”  >[...]  >“It is my understanding that DOGE contacted [the Justice Management Division] this afternoon and instructed them to terminate the contract,” she wrote.  ...  >In its amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the April 3 letter “appeared to be in violation of this Court’s order from March 17 requiring three days’ notice before any termination.”  >Perhaps that’s why, late in the day on April 4, the Justice Department rescinded the contract termination it sent less than 24 hours earlier. “Please disregard that communication in its entirety, which has no legal effect,” a department official wrote in a letter to the Acacia Center on Friday, April 4.  >In a recent court filing, lawyers for the government wrote that the April 3 termination letter “was sent in error.”  I'm running out of space, please go read the last 5 paragraphs and those bullet points for a TL;DR.",Sachyriel,2025-04-28T10:55:15,8
"Whoa - whoa, whoa, whoa…..are they suggesting that the Trump administration may not be communicating *in good faith*?   Really? This guy lies about his height. He lies about his wealth. He lies about what he had for breakfast. It’s pathological with him, and with his administration. It’s what they do.",Nwcray,2025-04-28T11:05:33,3
"They lie all the time. In fact, I assume everything coming from this administration is a lie until proven otherwise. FDT and all of his worshipping scum.",draftdodgerdon8647,2025-04-28T10:59:23,4
