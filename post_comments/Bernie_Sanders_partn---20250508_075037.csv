"Hell, I'm a Vermonter myself that has definitely had an interest in running for office, so I'll look into this. I align very closely to Sanders (an I vote for him every time), so I'd really be running as a continuation of Bernie. Something politics could 100% use more of.",TheNewTonyBennett,2025-05-08T08:35:21,33
"Hi! I'm president of Run for Something - thrilled to be partnering with Bernie on this work. Just wanted to say if anyone's interested in running, our pipeline resources are available to everyone regardless of age - you can look up what office you can run for at [runforwhat.net](http://runforwhat.net)   Our endorsements are limited to folks 40 & under but we've got lots of ways to help candidates of all ages beyond that.   Always happy to answer any questions!",amanda_litman,2025-05-08T14:22:08,8
Almost like building a farm league which is something the Boomers should have done decades ago if they weren't thinking they would live forever.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T08:04:33,16
"Run for Something is awesome as we need more young progressives in politics, [but they don’t endorse candidates over forty.](https://runforsomething.medium.com/who-we-endorse-why-we-endorse-them-and-what-it-all-means-2b7d53f2f0b2)",rodneedermeyer,2025-05-08T14:01:58,6
I'd love to challenge my congressman. A goodie but very old and I'm not interested in a situation like a few months ago.,alabasterskim,2025-05-08T10:08:58,3
The sad part is I can't help but want a VEEP sequel set at this organization.  Get on it HBO.,thenewNFC,2025-05-08T15:20:37,2
I read this as Barry Sanders. It makes sense he would partner with an org with a name like that.,jimohagan,2025-05-08T20:05:08,2

"Same. I sat in on their introductory Zoom call for ninety minutes before finding out that I wasn't in their preferred age bracket. You'd think they'd lead with that, but oh well.",rodneedermeyer,2025-05-08T22:56:06,1
