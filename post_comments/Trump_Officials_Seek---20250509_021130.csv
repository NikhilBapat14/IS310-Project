This makes no sense. The Afrikaners being refugees over Palestinians and Gaza? What is wrong with this country?,Lumpy-Marsupial-6617,2025-05-09T02:16:44,19
"All this amounts to is importing white people and exporting those who aren't.  These 54 ""refugees"" are going to need healthcare and jobs or welfare if they are so repressed, which goes against their ""America First"" agenda.  This is so blatantly ridiculous and the MAGA base will be delighted.  E:  Trump actually sent teams to Pretoria to screen them and is setting them up in the US with housing, furnishings, supplies, prepaid phones, etc.",Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-09T03:02:32,19
Fleeing the violent racist mess they made of South Africa?  They can relocate to Trump billionaire yachts.  America is already full-up with White Supremacists.,XSinTrick6666,2025-05-09T03:32:11,6

Because bigotry won't exist if everyone is white.           History hasn't shown that being a thing at all. /S,exophrine,2025-05-09T03:27:46,2
What a fine group of immigrants to join MAGA.   What a win! The hits just keep coming!,Libinky,2025-05-09T08:26:26,1

"I wonder which if the WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN BILLIONAIRES in Trump's ear came up with THIS racist boondoggle?  They shouldn't be considered ""refugees"" in the first place.  Whites OWN over 90% of South African land, and most of them work the land with cheap brown-skinned labor!  Obviously Trump wants to give AMERICAN TAXPAYER handouts to those White S. Africans who missed out on a violent racist colonial inheritance.  Same ManBaby who called Internet for Native Americans ""racist"" and ""unconstitutional"", now wants AMERICANS to subsidize WHITE South Africans.  As if we need MORE greedy, fascist, lying WHITE S. Africans in this country!",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-09T03:26:00,19
