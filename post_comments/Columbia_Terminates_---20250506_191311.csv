I want to find out what the research projects were targeting?,jnlsn,2025-05-07T03:40:47,101
How many people in administration and social sciences are going to be let go?,Ask4MD,2025-05-06T19:13:56,119
They'd apparently let researchers go rather than pay them out of their huge endowment. Bet they keep every libby pol sci prof though.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-06T19:23:59,103
What were they researching? Was it gender studies bullshit or actually useful stuff that‚Äôs going to mean we continue to fall being other countries in research,SecretConservAccount,2025-05-06T21:48:02,30
"But Columbia learned about the plans to bring back the encampment and threatened anyone who tried to do so with arrest. And just like that, the circus clowns never showed up. Not that week and not last week either. It seems like it is finally getting through to these folks that there is no upside for them, not now that the school is reacting quickly instead of negotiating with these dopes.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T10:25:54,3
"Well, damn it. Now we will never learn about the impact of gender affirming care in the transgender community of the indigenous pigmy goats of Western Africa.  Way to go Orange Hitler‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Ä¶.",mr_snartypants,2025-05-07T04:24:17,14
"It sounds like they were padding their books with Research Admin money and with it being gone or reduced, they can't afford the fluff anymore.",DaRiddler70,2025-05-07T05:16:54,6

"Let that money go to Florida, Texas, etc they have smart hard working scientist too ‚Ä¶ a few friends are researches in CA from TX they say the kids are horrible no work ethic show up late want it done for them ‚Ä¶",Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-06T19:35:51,-16
"Great to see.  Columbia should have considered consequences when they let terrorist sympathizers control campus, and when they refused to discipline students who violated their own rules.  A once great school has become a joke.",cofcof420,2025-05-07T07:08:18,2

"It‚Äôs Columbia, they probably cut the most critical projects just to make a point.",shocky32,2025-05-07T13:35:51,4
"Yeah, that's the important question.   If Columbia just dumped 180 of the best researchers on earth on diseases, astrophysics, and quantum mechanics, then this could honestly be seen as a loss.   But if Columbia did the obvious thing and dropped like 90% of the social studies department, well then that might actually be worth celebrating.",Trussed_Up,2025-05-07T06:08:37,72

"It is crazy What like 1 administrator per 2 students at Ivy League schools, Yale  is 5k admin for 6k students and Harvard to 6.5k undergraduates to 7k admin Columbia 6.75k to 8.2k student (normal 4 year college is around 70 admin per 1000 students let that sink in).",Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-06T19:36:48,97

"Probably.  I have an acquaintance whose research was cut.  She was studying the mental health distress of minority engineering students in colleges, and why they are less likely than other majors to seek mental health assistance.    Like yes it's a worthy cause, but does it really need to be funded by the feds, and cost a million or whatever dollars?  Engineering students are typically not a group that was raised big on mental health, and their workload at college leaves them too busy to go seek help even if they wanted it.",JerseyKeebs,2025-05-07T08:04:40,38
Insane amount of tax payer funded waste. How is that possible to have that much administration,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-05-07T03:07:38,29
