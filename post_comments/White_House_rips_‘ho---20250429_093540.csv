"Prices ARE up! A $9 cable on eBay has a $161 shipping fee! Infuriating!  So, the “White House” doesn’t like facts?! Every vendor trying to sell products from China should put the added “tax” FRONT and CENTER!  What a bunch of complete morons!!  I can’t imagine anyone wanting to pay 145% on top of the retail price for ANYTHING! Why is it so hard for this imbecile to understand… China doesn’t pay the increased costs… WE DO!  Does this idiot think we can just magically build hundreds of thousands of factories to build the products we have been buying from China for the last 30 plus years?? And, does this idiot think that the products, if made here, would be cheaper? Does he expect this to happen overnight?? I challenge everyone here to reach for something close to them… right now… as you read this… chances are if you turn it over, it reads, “MADE IN CHINA”! Gadgets, clothing, car parts, furniture, almost EVERYTHING is made in China because that’s how this country wanted it to be!! We switched from a manufacturing economy to a service economy decades ago!!   It would take decades to switch back, and it wouldn’t be humans doing the manufacturing, it will be robots!! How is that going to stimulate jobs, and help this economy?! This idiot is going to destroy our country, bankrupt the middle/lower class, and ruin our credibility… among many other things… and for what?!   Owning the libs? The libs won’t be the only ones paying these ridiculous, completely unnecessary taxes, the MAGA zombies will be paying them too! Remember that when that “thing” you need to buy only comes from China (because we don’t make it here), and your $100 widget now costs $1550 because, you know, the USA is so ~Great~ now!   China doesn’t need us. We are only 25% of their export market. They will adjust. They will watch with glee as Trump and his cabinet of clowns burns this entire country to the ground.   If this buffoon knew anything about diplomacy, we wouldn’t be in this situation. But, he thinks like a bully and a thug, and this is what we get. Fucking unreal.

"It must be baffling for people who follow Trump, to have once heard his advocacy of transparency in drug prices. Now he's suddenly turned 180 degrees and is _against_ transparency.  It must be a hard walk for Bezos. On one hand, he wants Trump to think he's a radical far-left institution-destroyer, totally onboard with MAGA.  On the other hand, he leans conservative, so of course he hates Trump. And he's pro-business, so he hates that Trump has imposed the biggest tax increase that he's ever seen in his entire lifetime, and that the tax is practically designed to irritate every single one of Amazon's customers.

"Dude, I’m all for them showing the costs of the tariffs. I just don’t think it’s politically motivated, it’s so that people don’t blame the company when costs more than double overnight. That’s just common sense",Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-04-29T10:18:29,7
"You don’t think Bezos thought this through and how it would play to Trump? Everyone knows that prices are going up because of the tariffs but, to blatantly list price flux is absolutely political and it’s a good thing too because it means potentially the tide is turning against Trump.  I guess common sense is not that common.",SaveLevi,2025-04-29T10:22:40,-1
"Of course bezos considered trump’s reaction into his decision. There can be a consideration of politics (and should be) into a business decision, but that doesn’t make the decision inherently political. He isn’t doing this to get at Trump (political), he is doing it to improve his business’s bottom line (business).",Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-04-29T10:31:58,1
