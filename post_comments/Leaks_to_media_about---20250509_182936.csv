"Yeah I mean when he ran he was a complete dipshit. Everyone real had concerns because the guy had a stroke. Democrats of course fervently defended him as the pinnacle of human intelligence because the narrative demanded it. Watching them eat their own now is pretty hilarious.  Suddenly it all matters like these moron leftists think we have the memory of a goldfish.  He recently came out super pro nuclear, and criticizing the left for their bullshit on scammy green energy shit.  I can't believe I'm saying this but I agree with Fetterman.",MaglithOran,2025-05-09T21:47:36,13

Hope Fetterman remembers who it was that defended him when the wolves were at the door. It's not unheard of for a sitting United States Senator to change parties.,Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T19:07:13,4
