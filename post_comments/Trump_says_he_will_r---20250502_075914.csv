The entire non-profit system has become a scam - it all needs to be re-evaluated and the status of many non-profits should be challenged.  This would probably hurt both conservative and liberal leaning non-profits but so be it.  Challenging the entire system will probably hold up better in court than picking just one or two of the worst bad-actors.,dww332,2025-05-02T08:17:28,144

Its hilarious how triggered the left gets by this.  Ivy League schools are diploma mills for rich people's lazy kids.  These are the oligarchs they are supposed to hate.  ðŸ¤£,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-02T09:06:51,60
Does their tax-exempt status use the same legal framework as a church being tax-exempt does? I worry that this might set a precedent for the removal of some religious organizations' tax-exempt status being revoked in the future if this goes through. Anyone else have that thought?,mrawsome197,2025-05-02T15:02:43,8

"Excellent. Make an example of the supposedly most prestigious university in the country.....and then watch as universities all over the country fall into line. But make no mistake about it....the concept of ""equity"" is deeply embedded in the academic ethos.

"Used to be an assistant golf course superintendent. One of the country clubs I used to work for is registered as a non-profit. In our monthly meetings they would brag about how many millions of dollars they had in the bank and any project/upgrade they wanted to do was always paid with cash - they never financed anything.   But because of their non-profit designation I was able to look up the salary information for employees that made over 100K. I remember getting a *20 dollar* christmas bonus and the general manager of the club who made over 700K got a 50K christmas bonus.   I don't really have an opinion on the actual subject at hand, just wanted to share my personal anecdote about non-profits.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-02T12:37:02,53

"Their tax-exempt status isn't a detriment to other religions. It's often made up of charitable donations from those who give to the church. It's not advantaging them over non-profits that take donations.  It does not present any compulsion towards religion whatsoever. How does ""if you give your money to the church, you don't have to pay taxes on it,"" benefit you? You'd still b e giving that money to another entity. You don't get a kickback from the government from giving to the church. Your comment is absurd.",cubs223425,2025-05-02T16:06:32,-5
