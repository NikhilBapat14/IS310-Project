"All the due process you need to deport an illegal immigrant is verification that they don't have legal residency, which is quite easy to discover and can take a matter of minutes. They don't have the right to take some bullshit asylum claim all the way up to the Supreme Court.  A system made for refugees fleeing a wartorn Europe is now being abused by people who want to DoorDash for remittances towards family members in countries they still vacation to.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-20T16:36:41,41
"After Biden & Company let millions come over the border illegally, following due process to get them out, within the current system, would be impossible.  They blocked what voters voted for. Insane.",MrsKiwi66,2025-04-20T16:18:26,16

"Alito said the legal filings, “while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation.” He noted that while the court did not hear directly from the government regarding any planned deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in this case, a government lawyer in a different matter had told a U.S. District Court in a hearing Friday evening that no such deportations were then planned to occur either Friday or Saturday.  “In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote. “I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate. Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law.”",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T22:28:43,3
"This is why I was not very happy with Kavenah and Barret. Robert’s could go either way, and maybe even Gorsuch, but the other two are disappointing. I am not usually critical of them, but any time you give the ACLU a win, is not a good day. I hope this has nothing to do with Trump not bringing back the El Salvador guy.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-20T16:34:38,7
