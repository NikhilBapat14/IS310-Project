If it walks like a fascist and talks like a fascist...,dropkickninja,2025-05-09T16:22:14,450
"On Friday, Donald Trump abruptly removed the three sitting Democrat appointees on the five-person U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission — the independent watchdog agency that issues recalls and regulates everyday products, including consumer electronics. With no apparent cause for removal, the firings violate existing Supreme Court precedent dating back to 1935, as did Trump’s removals of the Democratic commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) back in March.  The firing comes in the wake of a draft budget proposal that would have eliminated the CSPC, whose commissioners are bipartisan by law and who serve five-year terms. The proposal would have instead rolled the commission’s regulatory powers into the Department of Health and Human Services, which is led by a political appointee — presently, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  Read more from Sarah Jeong and Tina Nguyen: [https://www.theverge.com/news/664498/consumer-product-safety-commission-cpsc-trump-firing](https://www.theverge.com/news/664498/consumer-product-safety-commission-cpsc-trump-firing)",theverge,2025-05-09T16:20:15,166

"Firing individuals without a legitimate cause, as described, would violate established legal precedent, particularly Humphrey's Executor v. United States, a 1935 Supreme Court case. This case established that presidents can only remove certain officials, like those in independent agencies, for ""cause"" such as ""inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty"". Without a valid reason for dismissal, the firing would be a legal violation, potentially overturning decades of established legal principle.   But he’s already not listening to the Supreme Court on other stuff so it’s OK right?",just-readingit,2025-05-10T06:12:24,8

learn the words YOU use when you wanna sound smart.   Just because the president CAN do something doesnt mean he should. Hope that helps,fallingstar-ego,2025-05-10T06:12:25,6
You realize you can still be fired illegally right? Like this doesn’t cover for them just cause they worked within the executive branch. So you’re speaking nothing into this  Learn what the words you use mean.,THEdoomslayer94,2025-05-10T08:25:51,3
Just because it's part of the executive doesn't mean he can fire random people at will. Trump can basically only remove those in most appointed positions. Regular government workers can only be fired with cause.  But why are you even defending this in the first place.,airfryerfuntime,2025-05-10T13:33:59,1
