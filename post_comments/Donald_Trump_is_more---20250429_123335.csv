“Don't take security in the false refuge of consensus.”  ― Christopher Hitchens,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T12:35:37,15
"Probably the most unsurprising thing in polling isn't that Trump's disapprovals are up but that his general approval among Republicans never really fluctuates. Trump consistently has high Republican approval no matter what happens, and this usually translates to a rock solid national approval between 36-42% depending on the poll you're looking at.  Likewise, Democrats don't seem to much change their minds on Trump.  The only people who change their minds on him keep flip flopping, and those are independents. I'm not really convinced of some of the article writers presentation, at least in the area of supporting some specific conclusions. Go to deep red country in Ohio and you'll get deep red country in Ohio opinions. These opinions are not defiant or counter to any polling about Trump; this is where that 36-42% of people who always approve of Trump no matter what live. I don't find highlighting their responses or feelings very revelatory. I could have farted out a random guess and been 100% correct about how they feel.  In that, the broader point the article notes is correct but it's been true since before the election. Hoping that opinion polls will salve reality is a false hope. Opinion polls have margins of error of a few percentage points. Guess how close the last couple elections have been? A few percentage points.  Polls aren't the issue. What lessons people try to take from polls is at issue and they've been an issue since 2020 when a lot of people seemed to overlook the dreary reality that Biden might have been the most voted for Presidential Candidate in US history, but Trump was the second most voted for. And these elections are not being made by partisans or dedicated politically active people. They're being decided by political outsiders and impromptu voters who are hard to account for in any polling and have frequently favored Trump over other candidates (including other Republicans going by 2024's results).",Lord0fHats,2025-04-29T12:46:13,5

Salon mistakes dislike of Democrats as a rational response. In my experience and observation there has been a personalized attack on the left since the contract on America and further ramped up by the tea party movement and the Trump lying bullhorn campaign that is designed to trigger a glandular response among the population that lacks the capacity to exercise a nearly absent ability to think reasonably through its highly successful branding campaign. Hate is way easier and satisfying to those unable to think critically. Apologies for the dangling adverb.,Mundane_Ride4073,2025-04-29T12:57:32,4

"These recent polls are somewhat encouraging but there are caveats for sure. People could be saying they dislike what he’s doing but still change their mind in the booth in 2026 and vote for Trump allies for Congress ultimately. The polls don’t indicate that he’s losing his base or that Dems are directly gaining back the independents and infrequent voters who are becoming disillusioned with them either. This is a good step and hopefully the start of a trend that ends up going in Dems’ favor, but Trump is far from weakened.",StormOk7544,2025-04-29T13:26:26,2

"I've been saying all along that the real problem is the Democrats.    Any half decent party in any democracy in the world should have been able to demolish a candidate like Trump and a clown show like MAGA.     The Democrats are incredibly useless. I live in Massachusetts and I've written a series of letters to both Lori Trahan and Elizabeth Warren urging them to greater action, and suggesting a variety of things he could be doing even though their party is in the minority in Congress.   I've given them clear examples of other members of their party who are doing the things I'm suggesting.    The only responses I've gotten are pure boilerplate that don't address any of the concerns I mentioned. When you write to them they have a drop-down list of subject matter to choose from when you send a message. At least as of a week or two ago when I sent my last one none of those dropped down items mentioned Trump.

Yup agreed! Last election there were a lot of people who clearly voted for him with reservations because they hated Kamala/Biden so much. Some were done with the Dems for not standing up to Israel. Some felt that crime was on the rise where they lived and the Dems just said nothing while the GOP said “yeah crime! We will smash the criminals!” Which many people clearly liked even if it’s simplistic!

"If these people were merely voting due to their struggle then I think that ignoring them would be a bad way to go.  Except, that isn't what they're doing.  They vote for MAGA, at least in part, because they like that Trump hates the people that they hate.  They like that he speaks his mind about this hatred of people that they hate.  They'll even vote against their own interests in order to further this hate.  Farmers struggled under Trump the first go around and the US had to bail them out because of the tariffs that dried up their markets.  Yet, they lined back up to vote for him each time.  He claimed he'd save coal multiple times and yet coal hasn't been saved and has continued to falter.  Yet, the people of Appalachia came out in droves to support him.  When these people are asked why it isn't really ever about what he can do to economically save them, and if it is then it is at most that ""he's bringing back American manufacturing,"" which none of them have ever felt the effects of, because he didn't do that either.  Instead, they speak of immigrants and trans people and how the left is crazy or communist or some other thing.  These people may be struggling but they aren't voting the way they are because they're actually victims of the economic times and seeking real help in that regard... they're voting the way they are because they're blaming other people for their problems and Trump is confirming that with his own message of hate.",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-29T13:16:22,9
