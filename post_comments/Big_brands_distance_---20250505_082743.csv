Did we honestly believe they ever gave a shit? You only ever needed to see that their social media profiles in the Middle East had zero mention of it to know what they really think.,Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-05T08:40:30,87

"Pride was a riot. It was never some product for big brands to buy and sell.   This year, we remember that.",Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-05-05T08:33:57,21
"I’m glad, our local parades have devolved into a 2 hour commercial spectacle full of local and national sponsors reducing representation of our community.",Wild_mush_hunter,2025-05-05T10:51:59,6
"It was always performative allyship.  Pride began as a protest and many in the community objected to the increased corporatization of events, as events also became some family-friendly slightly queer fair and parade.  The winds of change blow from DC and the opportunity for the LGBTQ+ community is finding our who are actual allies.    Pride can get back to being a protest.  It hurts a bit when you find out a friend was using you.  I get it.  But here we are.  There are opportunities, even in dark times.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-05T09:07:12,19
">Marty Zuniga, who helps organize PrideFest in St. Louis — one of the Midwest’s biggest LGBTQ+ celebrations — could tell by January that this season would be unlike any he’s seen. That’s when Zuniga noticed that corporate contacts weren’t answering his emails. In the weeks that followed, longtime partners like Anheuser-Busch declined to sponsor this year’s two-day festival while others slashed donations, leaving him with a massive gap in his budget  Ok, internet, you know what to do. Lets give Anheuser-Busch the ol' Target treatment.",theflower10,2025-05-05T08:35:55,23

Yeah but I got the surreal experience of marching in San Diego Pride behind an attack drone brought to you by Raytheon.  Raytheon: for the month of June we will now be bombing gay weddings in Afghanistan!,pomonamike,2025-05-05T09:19:23,13
>Did we honestly believe they ever gave a shit?  No. Nobody said we did. But I assume it’s better to promote acceptance than the current administration’s approach of accepting hate. They’re literally demanding private companies remove DEI. The DOJ dropped a case against a doctor that leaked private info about transgender patients. Looking at brands leaving pride events and not caring is such shortsighted thinking. Look at the overall trend.,JewsieJay,2025-05-05T10:40:42,5
Not to defend BigCo but the federal government is targeting companies with DEI policies.,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-05T08:46:52,0

June will still be pride month even without the soulless attempt by corporations to act like they are sympathetic to the cause lmao,blues111,2025-05-05T09:07:14,21
"Already done, their beer tastes like shit anyways.",Luckilygemini,2025-05-05T08:44:48,20
"Exactly. This is a canary in the coal mine. When companies pander to a demographic it’s because they think it’ll make them money.  You have societal acceptance and support. You matter as a person who might buy things. When they no longer pander to you, you might as well be dead.",ExZowieAgent,2025-05-05T15:20:35,4
"Principles aren’t for just when it’s convenient. If they believe in DEI, then they’ll stick with the policy, like Costco and others.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-05T08:51:32,43

"… the current government is targeting companies that engage in DEI activities, that includes lgbt. Yes, corporations bad. But look at the big picture. Why are they distancing themselves from DEI/LGBT issues? You think it’s good that the government is trying to make private companies be less accepting of America’s diverse population?",JewsieJay,2025-05-05T10:48:31,0
don’t forget about all the “local” beers that sold out and are now made by AB.  https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands,loquacious_avenger,2025-05-05T09:50:33,6
I wouldn’t say it has any taste at all tbf. Bud light is water that gets you drunk.,mrjim87x,2025-05-05T09:21:55,1
Yeah easiest boycott ever,Elmer_Whip,2025-05-05T09:31:33,1
The principle of DEI is that practicing DEI initiatives provides material benefits to the organization. Let's say the benefit of DEI was 10 units (of whatever) and now the federal government is gonna punish them 15 units. Now practicing DEI costs them something. Before it earned them something.,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-05T09:02:14,-20
"Nope, and people can call out/boycott companies who do so as they see fit  Otherwise we cant really control what they do im just saying pride month can and must still exist in spite of that",blues111,2025-05-05T10:56:17,6

Barely gets you drunk either.  It’s got like 20% less alcohol than hard seltzer.,rudimentary-north,2025-05-05T10:20:39,0
"Well then we’re back to them never having truly given a shit. It was never about giving minorities a chance - it was about a business advantage.   In which case all of their messages about “love for our queer brothers and sisters” or “our family in the black community” were obviously bullshit.   If they could have got 10 units by hiring from the Klan, they would have.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-05T09:05:07,15
I thought we were talking about the principles of DEI. One of those principles is that it benefits the organization. You seem to ignore the two points I'm making. The one I just repeated and the FACT that the federal government is targeting organizations that practice it. I'm in favor of DEI. I'm also in favor of admitting water is wet and the sun shines during the day time. The orgs aren't the problem. Maga is,ToNoMoCo,2025-05-05T09:06:10,-13
"I didn’t ignore it. I said these policies aren’t for only WHEN IT’S CONVENIENT. If a company chooses to only have non-discriminatory hiring policies when it’s good for business, then that company is prejudiced.   Obviously MAGA are piling pressure on these companies, I haven’t denied that. I also think that these companies falsely sold themselves as allies in the first place, got the benefit from being considered allies, and now they’re seeing the other side of the coin.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-05-05T09:33:57,13
"Now, they're being extorted to end DEI. It's not ""piling on pressure.""  It's extortion. I get it. BigCo is evil. Everyone who works for them is evil.",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-05T09:48:57,-7
