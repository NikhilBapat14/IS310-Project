"I'd like to know how enforcement of something like this works?! I lost my job because of El Presidente. So I haven't been buying ANYTHING except the cheapest food I can find. does this mean that I'm inadvertently ""boycotting"" something? Like does her really thing he can build an overreach program that punishes broke people for NOT buying things? If it was just businesses and corporations I could kinda get the mentality. But individuals? How do you even police something like that? Does this mean in the future if I say ""I'm not buying something because it sucks"" I Could go to fucking prison because I DIDN'T spend money? guess ""Free market"" is right the fuck out",Jushara_iiskra,2025-05-04T19:39:00,11

"Is the slaughter house in Gaza in America’s best interest?  Are the killings of journalists and UN workers in America’s best interest?  Let’s just theorize for a minute that an American president or law maker sees things differently and believes that these actions put Americans in danger and are not in line with what our values are, would they go to jail?

"Can you elaborate for the benefit of other people and myself (not an expert in history) on the following 2 points:  1. How/Why we owe “a lot of help”? (Sure we should help, but the choice of ‘owe’ implies a debt we have to Israel )   2. How/Why safety of both nations are directly connected? (The safety of a nation is a priority matter. But the issue is: how is one a vehicle of safety to another because the mere dependency implies a HUGE security gap for each)",atwistofcitrus,2025-05-05T10:25:51,2

"“Judgement day”?! I respect your spirituality but do you really want to face judgement day when your tax dollars got Israel to this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CatsAreMuslim/s/186uWqkBmk  If I were you, I’d be scared of that judgement day. Is this what Jesus preach? Not in my church and in my name and not with my tax dollars. Trust me when I tell you that we ALL are guaranteed to burn in hell (if there he’ll or heaven) for the atrocities that Israel is now committing.    “Hamas coming for America” With what Navy? With what Air Force? With what army? With what satellites?  I hope you clarify.",atwistofcitrus,2025-05-06T15:58:18,1
