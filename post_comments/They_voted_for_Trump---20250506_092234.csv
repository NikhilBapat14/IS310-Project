First of all, let's roll back the assumption that since time immemorial, humans had to have documents to go/live/be where they are. This is certainly not true. The world as we know it today, where there is a status of being legal / illegal (undocumented) resident is a relatively modern thing, and likely an apparatus of nation-states or shortly before. In past configurations of societies, documentation for residency or belonging purposes was not a thing.  Given that documentation is more of a thing today, I still don't understand why it should bother anyone that someone is an undocumented migrant. Live and let be.

I'll probably get downvoted for this. Hispanic people pretend to struggle like black people and have some of the privilege of white people that they ignore. The entitlement is not as bad as white people but they're entitled nonetheless.  Yes they can be racist especially to their darker (afro-latino or native) skinned counterparts. You have to be a certain shade in your family and environment. If you're dark skinned in a light-skinned family you'll be the scapegoat. if your light skinned in a dark-skinned family you'll also be the scapegoat. My sister's husband's family is very acceptable and don't act like that but for my family That's a different story.

If you look at a chart of fentanyl deaths in the US it's beyond shocking and people should've been completely freaking out about it all along. 103,000 fentanyl overdoses in 2023, 107,000 in 2024.  My nephew died of an accidental overdose last week and he wasn't a heavy drug user, obviously he took something, but nothing that should've killed him. There are a lot of people who are desperate for change because they know someone who has died or been ruined by that shit.  All those videos of people nodding off on the street...they've been around for years now. To call this an epidemic is an understatement.  Something needs to happen, but it just makes me sick that because Democrats dragged their feet waiting for an institutional fix in the way that Democrats approach fucking everything, and they did nothing meaningful to stop illegal fentanyl and illegal immigration. Now the Trump administration and MAGA are leveraging the suffering of the families of fentanyl victims to carry out their racist agenda against legal refugees and completely fuck our country over.  In my mind Democrats are just as much to blame for their inaction and allowing not just MAGA to fester but also in watching hundreds of thousands die.  So yeah, fentanyl/immigration and the southern border are a huge issue, and rightfully so.",Pretty-Balance-Sheet,2025-05-06T10:27:51,-9
">In interviews over the weekend, Trump had doubled down on his claim that U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who was born in Indiana, **should not preside over** the Trump University fraud case **because of his Mexican heritage.** Trump also said he thought it was ""absolutely"" possible that a Muslim judge also would treat him unfairly. On Friday, Trump referred to a supporter in the crowd at a rally in Redding, Calif., as ""my African-American,"" sparking criticism.

Being duped has little to do with critical thinking.. you can‚Äôt undo information poisoning from social media because it pervades your social circle and interests.   I understand how the logic makes critical thinking into a shield but that‚Äôa not how our brains take in and process information.  You see it in movies where the protagonist often begins as the bad guy.  They believe what they read and hear from their private collage and this takes a lot to overcome.   It has a passive element to it.  For example.  In the Rochester Reddit there is a doctor talking about how MAGA she is and how many others are doing important and high level jobs in the community.  She ignores what is happening in lieu of her ego not allowing her to accept what is.  It‚Äôs difficult to accept but people turn to other people and their life experiences before embracing critical thinking.

"Exactly. Both Trump and Vance were very clear that they consider people that are here legally to be illegal, because Trump and Vance don't agree with the processes by which the immigrants arrived legally (Vance specifically mentioned this in regards to the Haitian immigrants in his home state, Ohio). Trump and Vance also made it clear they consider ALL illegals to be criminals, so now following the train of thought, the legal immigrants that Trump and Vance consider to be illegal, are also considered to be criminal by them. Lastly, they have made clear that they plan to go further than even this, by removing birth right citizenship. They will then consider CITIZENS to be illegal, and criminals. All of this was laid out BEFORE Trump was elected.

"[Did you look into what Biden‚Äôs administration did to address those concerns?](https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/ondcp/the-administrations-strategy/biden-harris-administration-actions-to-address-the-overdose-epidemic/)  Because it was pretty significant, and way more than Trump ever did prior to Biden taking office.  Not to mention it was a multi-pronged, far-reaching approach that ultimately did wind up in far increased drug seizures at the border, especially in the last few months of 2024. Narcan is also freely available in many, many places now because of it, which was never implemented prior.  Citizens seem to love to shit on Biden because he was handed a complete disaster of an economy, border situation, and social injustice straight after Trump was finished breaking as much as he could during his first four years. *It takes longer to build things than it does to destroy them.*   People have short attention spans and massively under inform themselves when there are a ton of excellent, factual resources available that point out the exact opposite of most claims about how ‚Äúterrible‚Äù Biden did pulling the country out of the shit show Trump created. Things were never going to look stellar in the first four years recovering from that, but Biden‚Äôs administration put a solid dent in helping to move things in a much better direction in the short time he had to do it. He navigated the *global recession* better than pretty much any other country, much to the surprise of the rest of the world as it happened.  Do I think he should have backed off running again way sooner than he did? Without a doubt. But I think his incumbent status wasn‚Äôt something to take for granted when it came to what might help eek out a Dem victory with consideration to how generally ignorant and reactive the vast majority of the American public have shown themselves to be, and he rolled the dice with that and didn‚Äôt come out on top with that decision, unfortunately for us all.  But to expect that things would have been near completely fixed or entirely resolved in the four years he had is an ignorant take, buddy, sorry to say. That‚Äôs not how massive problems like that work, and having that expectation is doing a disservice to the many milestones that were achieved before ‚ÄúBreak All the Things Dictator‚Äù was put back in office. I think it‚Äôs safe to say it was pretty obvious that getting a grip on Fentanyl trafficking was never going to do better under this administration, because they‚Äôre stripping power and personnel left and right from agencies that could genuinely make that happen, and opting to just inflict as much cruelty and loss of human rights as possible (as was clearly outlined in Project 2025, released far enough before the election by enough news sources for everyone to have properly informed themselves about it).",TheMarkHasBeenMade,2025-05-06T11:21:49,14

Who is it really protecting and from who?  Suicidal terrorists?   Why do terrorists exist?  Who runs TSA?    On the topic of gun control, what do we mean by control?  Is it really going to save us from mass killing?  Why do gun owners feel the need to have powerful guns?  What rights are we giving up besides the 2nd amendment?

The sample was skewed.   Polls that represent the diversity of the Latino community actually show that most Latinos (especially Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Central Americans) backed Harris. Including men.  The only demographic that Republicans won easily were Cuban American men.  But I think it has more to do with the fact that Cubans think that Democrats = communists than with her race or gender.

"Yeah a big problem with trump supporters is they dont actually pay all that much attention and assume a LOT more good faith/competence towards him and his agenda. Most of the ones i know arent bad people, not really. Its easy to get mad at them and dehumanize them as nazis or whatever and there are certainly those among them. But many of them are just frustrated, not wwell educated or well informed and in the sphere of right wing propaganda that unfortunately has a very good system for getting its messaging across in a compelling way even if its almost entirely based in falsehoods.   The only times ive ever gotten this kind of trump supporter to realize elsewise is by long, patient, conversations where i specifically avoid any sort of us and theming. We just talk, somewhat socratically, about the issues and what his agenda is, and i ask gentle questions and always use we statements rather than I or you etc. And it does work. A good friend of mine was getting pulled into that by some people he worked with and i just had a talk with him one time in the car and by the end he realized, Trump doesnt have a plan, he just stirs up shit that people are angry about. And once i got him to realize THAT, i was able to more critically attack trump and get him to realize that not only does he not have a plan, he lies, constantly. And now hes a critic. He didnt vote either way in 24 so it doesnt really matter in this particular instance, im just sharing the only way to actually help people see past this bullshit. I cant do it online though.

For the religious, they have gone their whole lives reasoning within the framework of scripture but consciously push back against any suggestion to question that foundation. Secularly, there are examples like right wing ""libertarian"" praxeology which seeks to form theories based only off first principles and rejects any attempt to check the premises with empirical evidence.

Tariffs, haphazard immigration policies, flagrant dismissal for the the rule of law, anti-science and anti-intellectualism were key parts and implemented in his first term.   ""Defund the police"" was straight up political malpractice. It cost democratic congressional seats in 2020. I support the ideas behind it but it was a bad slogan. Nancy Mace rode in on that backlash.   While phone banking I remembered having to readjust the message to ""demilitarizing the police"" or ""deprograming the police state."" Because even democratic leaning voters still want to have a police force but just have different mission outlines for them.   ""I want the police to be trained on the idea that they are mediators in our neighborhoods and enforcers of the laws on the books not being prepared to go into a warzone and extrajudicial of the law.""

"Absolutely agreed. There was a report by NPR years back around 2014 I think it was that surveyed teachers who said that empathy was critically lacking in the schools from their perspectives, and that parents needed to do a better job instilling this emotional intelligence.  Meanwhile we look at self-identifying reports from PEW Research on parents and what virtues they opt to prioritize in their children. Liberal parents prioritized curiosity and tolerance while conservative ones prioritized obedience and faith. Take these to their respective logical conclusions and the bigger picture of where we are now makes complete sense, sadly.  Speaking as someone who came from a rural blue collar conservative family and who all changed over the past decades, these people tend to lack one or more of the following: (1) Formal critical-thinking skills, (2) Empathy, and/or (3) Time to parse the muddied waters of reality. I've met every combination of these people, and my family mostly fell into the third category until we got more time. But I've never met a Trump supporter or couch sitter who didn't lack at least one of these.

"I don't think it's a lack of intelligence that's the problem, tbh. It's a lot of factors leading to a set of habits, all of which can be changed, systemically.  It starts with school being a traumatic experience for a lot of people. Being sent without your consent, forced to sit for long hours listening to shit you don't care about, the few teachers who are abusive but nobody cares, etc. None of these are good feelings to attach to the process of learning.  Add to that, the authoritarian school model doesn't teach us how to teach ourselves OR how to make it fun. It teaches us how to do what we're told. So when nobody's telling us to learn, or what to think or believe, a lot of people just... don't. ___  The key to this kind of intelligence isn't something genetic, the right answers don't just come unbidden from the subconscious of intelligent people. Or rather, they do, but so do all manner of ridiculously stupid ones. No, the key is learning to be critical of your own thoughts, the way you would an LLM. It's a skill, discerning the genius from the madness, and with the right care and attention, this skill can be *taught*.   Just having a mandatory course on logic starting in primary school would work wonders. Teach every child about all of the logical fallacies, along with all of the cognitive biases. Design lessons that humble the students, get them comfortable with the idea of being proven wrong, foster the idea that it's good to be proven wrong, and to accept it, because it's the feeling of sharpening your perception. Teach them how to debate, particularly for things they disagree with, so they can get better at pitting ideas against each other in their own minds.  We're all collectively deciding what kind of culture we have. We can make media that models and encourages this kind of thinking. We push to set standards in children's television, in advertising and broadcasting in general, to stop them from (intentionally or not) generating consumer zombies and tools of fascist cults.

Latinos asked Democrats very few things. Democrats never did anything of what Latinos asked. Democrats are at fault here.   Latinos never took Democrats for granted. Democrats took Latinos for granted. And still most Latinos voted Democrat.

"Fox is certainly doing a lot of pretending. They don't report on the things that would put the Trump administration or conservative politics in a bad light. And they actively disseminate false claims (like about the 2020 election). And other (more liberal-leaning) networks certainly don't always do a good job of being even-handed. We'll probably disagree on the liberal-leaning media being just as bad as Fox in the opposite direction (they're not, in my view).  But blaming the media (of whatever stripe) is just another copout, I think. In the end, adults need to BE adults and try to make the best decisions they can based on common sense, and common sense dictates that you try to be as well-informed as you can. If you live in a rural area and look around you and see everything in constant decline, but somehow your local Fox affiliate doesn't seem to care about giving you any useful information and merely praises the Great Orange Leader, then it makes sense to look elsewhere for more complete information. At no time in human history have we had so much access to so much information from so many different sources (a problem in itself, I'm aware).   But people not having time for ""political information"" strikes me as an odd argument. What is ""politics"" if not a shorthand for how your government and country are run? If you think it's being run like shit and you're upset about it, you HAVE to be concerned about politics, especially if you're having to work three jobs and you don't want to take on a fourth.
