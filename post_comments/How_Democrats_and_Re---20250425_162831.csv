"You can always tell a Republican - from the way they use air quotes whenever they vocalize the word ""science"".",pharrt,2025-04-25T16:34:58,37
"Id love to see how many times each party references the same research paper. Whenever I see a citation for research on republican media I swear it's one of like 5 research papers that have been thoroughly debunked for a decade or more. The Antivax one, that one about how ice in a specific part of Antarctica is gaining mass, a few papers on HRT side effects from the 90s. I swear it's the research equivalent of doing donuts in a parking lot and saying you drove a mile.",MountainMan2_,2025-04-25T16:34:09,17
"Lol well, yeah. Back years and years ago when I was a right-winger I would get so annoyed when doing research to back up my assertions because it was so fucking hard to find credible outlets and studies that supported my assertions. And the reason for that is because, broadly speaking, left-wing policies are the ones actually based on empirical data and such. Right-wingers are guided primarily by emotions (fear, greed, selfishness), bigotry, and religion.",ltalix,2025-04-25T17:32:44,13

That's the point. Science and reason are inconvenient towards accomplishing Republican goals of subjugating working class Americans and establishing a far-right Christo-fascist ethnostate.,friendsafariguy11,2025-04-25T17:08:11,7

"It's frustrating. One of my conservative friends is a wealthy guy who was born a country boy and became an entrepreneur. He regularly shared things about ivermectin from quacks and bad articles. He gets a lot of his health info from Dr. Berg and similar ""alternative medicine"" influencers online.  And predictably, he thinks Fauci should be jailed for ""his role in creating and profiting off COVID.""",Due-Egg4743,2025-04-25T16:40:43,4
"No doubt their references are circular also.  Four sources will circle back to the same errant study or anecdotal evidence,  just use ""people believe"" or ""it's common knowledge"", or even worse ""the Bible says"".",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-25T17:17:02,4

Conservatives also tend to take a legitimate research paper and somehow make the conclusions the opposite of what the paper actually concluded.,bejammin075,2025-04-25T16:57:11,10
"Don’t forget the “rapid onset gender dysphoria” one. They love that sad excuse for science.   (For those unaware, the paper concluded that trans-ness is a social contagion among teens, but the methodology involved only surveying parents on a website for parents who don’t want their kids to be trans)",Violet-Journey,2025-04-25T20:07:18,7
