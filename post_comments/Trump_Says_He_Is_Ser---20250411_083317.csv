"Frankly, if he successfully managed a candidacy for a third term, actual votes wouldn't matter. Simply pulling off being the Republican candidate would mean he's gutted the constitution, so why bother with an election?

I live on the gulf coast so it will be a walk. I have never been so frustrated with this country but I knew early last fall.

That’s a hike but probably well worth it lol!  So I’m 49 and wasn’t much into politics before Trump came along but I always voted democrat. I’ve been following all this since 2016 and I’m disgusted. I loathed him long before he ran for president. I knew he was going to win too. I knew it the minute they announced Harris was going to be the candidate. I can only imagine what you had to deal with. I didn’t get one phone call from either party but for some reason my husband got a lot. I’m looking to get involved in 2028 to help campaign.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-04-11T11:39:13,6
