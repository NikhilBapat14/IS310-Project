"I live in Washington State. The last time this shit happened: ""Border ambiguity The Oregon Treaty of June 15, 1846, resolved the Oregon boundary dispute by dividing the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the United States and Britain (future Canada) ""along the 49th parallel of north latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from off-shore Vancouver Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean.""[1]  However, two straits could be called the middle of the channel: Haro Strait, along the west side of the off-shore San Juan Islands; and Rosario Strait, along the east side.[2]""  1846. Do you understand how atavistic this bullshit is? We call these the Pig Wars. Literally wars over a pig.  Same thing now, only the pig is motherfucking Orange.",Mindless-Pogram,2025-05-04T02:08:42,15
"The length of the border between Canada and the US is 5,250 miles — the longest border between two countries on earth. Our border with Mexico is almost 2,000 miles. Thanks to the Trump Administration, both countries hate us. Chew on that for awhile.",invalidpassword,2025-05-04T02:14:32,12

Sigh.   The headline is completely wrong. It’s not the tariffs that are the problem.  It’s the threat to Canadas sovereignty.  Headlines and stories like this which ignore that just make the situation worse.  Canada wants Americans to acknowledge that Trump is completely wrong to suggest that Canada should be the 51st state and that they do not condone what he says. ,After-Distribution69,2025-05-04T07:15:05,8
"Complicit.  The word that everyone is looking for is complicit.    As in anyone and everyone who voted for Trump is complicit in the devolving political, economic, social and cultural state that fascist America, and therefore by extension the world, finds itself in.  Fascist America is now ruled via diktat by an odious, feckless and corrupt cabal of oligarchs, technocrats, kleptocrats and self-serving “politicians “.  This is enabled by a compromised Supreme Court which has abrogated its legal, moral and ethical obligations and responsibilities.  Reap the whirlwind, America.",Spanky3703,2025-05-04T08:59:15,6
Seems more than bit ironic that those who can tell you more about their favorite sport than they can about who serves them in office are the ones impacted by the consequences of not paying as much attention to politics as they do hockey pucks.,ceiffhikare,2025-05-04T06:11:00,1

"I'm conflicted.  On the one hand, we need to keep alive the personal relationships between ordinary people, to maintain goodwill until after Trump is gone, when presumably there will again need to be a reset.  On the other hand, folks in Saginaw voted for this, and we will not change their minds until they feel in their own homes and pocketbooks the consequences of Trump's destruction. As such, Canadian sports teams should be shunning American teams, and absolutely not traveling to the US, to send a clear signal that ""business as usual"" is over, and America will need to win back the trust of Canada, if that is even achievable.",bandersnatching,2025-05-04T10:09:08,1

>Canada wants Americans to acknowledge that Trump is completely wrong to suggest that Canada should be the 51st state and that they do not condone what he says.   Americans who are not in trumps cult agree trump is wrong. The problem is MAGA tends to scream the loudest so the sane Americans get drowned out.,WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-05T14:14:13,1
"Perhaps the future of Saginaw in the Canadian Hockey League hangs in the balance due to increased difficulty crossing the border, but Hockey will outlast any conflict between Canada and the United States. Donald Trump’s tariffs are causing the economic problems in Saginaw and every other major US city and state that has significant trade with Canada.  More importantly, to Canadians, it’s his (and his sycophants) statements about taking Canada over as the 51st state that has us riled up much more so than the tariffs.",GKM72,2025-05-04T10:05:03,1

But no one is commenting on what MAGA is saying.  Was it MAGA who wrote this article implying that the problem is the tariffs? ,After-Distribution69,2025-05-04T07:25:53,2
