"I think we've all been wrong about Trump. All this time, we thought he should be in prison. Really, he belongs in a mental institution. Polls are ""election fraud,"" lol.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-28T15:27:12,4
"Of course he thinks they're fake. He has people surrounding him all the time telling him how great he is and how much the American people love him. So when he sees something that runs contrary to that, he experiences a narcissistic collapse.  Just [watch this part](https://youtu.be/f_uo1BIrExY?t=1101) of his cabinet meeting where Pam Bondi is straight up feeding him lies because it's what he wants to hear. The whole thing is a glorified ass-kissing session.",s_falco,2025-04-28T16:26:29,3

How does the polling square with the EO’s declaring we will be run as a meritocracy? Sounds like someone is wanting special accommodations.,bluebird-1515,2025-04-28T21:14:23,1
Must be tiring every day knowing that you think the people that surround you are out to execute you but could really give a shit about you. How fragile of an ego must you have? That's frightening.,ChaoticMutant,2025-04-29T00:14:45,1
