"""as long as the conversations are not classified'  Signal is a step up from plain email, but Gmail's secure mode is just as good.  The fact that private sector encrypted information services exist and are convenient is not relevant.    1. THE CONVERSATIONS THEY HAD WERE CLASSIFIED. 2. SHE WAS A PARTICIPANT AS THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE.  Her job is literally to set and enforce policy on classified information. 3. The information they passed around was classic TOP SECRET, SCI stuff.  Information leaks at this level are BY DEFINITION capable of causing grave damage to the national security of the USA. 4. SHE IS AN ACCOMPLICE TO SERIOUS CRIMES.   Who gives AF what she says?  I mean, aside from the fact that she still has her job when she should have been marched out of the building to the curb within hours. 5. This may be unrelated to her hearing, but Hegseth set up a chat room with uncleared people with absolutely no need to know and gave them time-sensitive TS/SCI updates.  He should have been frog marched to jail in handcuffs.  On a more human note, much of that damage would be loss of military lives.  Hegseth, Gabbard, and a few others are former military. If you know the culture you know how unforgivable that is.  It's infinitely worse because they are announcing that the security policy of this administration does think their lives are important, and is not seriously concerned with mission success.  The new policy is maximal impact on social media. WTF?  I've been closely associated with the DOD/IC world for almost half a century.

Trump: Joe Biden shit my pants!!,AriesUndercover,2025-04-26T17:58:20,7
"How are they trying to blame this on Biden?: During Biden's admin, his people have the OK for it to be used for inner/outer office communication.  Why is this a big nothing burger and a bad faith misdirection?: Biden era folks were under explicit instructions that Signals was not to be used for anything but typical office or personal conversations. At any point where sensitive information needed to be discussed, or classified/top secret information for that matter, Signal was only to be used to direct someone to the appropriate avenue to have those discussions.  Why none of this even matter: at the end of the day we can talk all we want about why Signal is or isn't being used. The real issue is the following three things, none of which has anything to do with the Biden admin.  1. A journalist was added to a group chat and in on the discussions about an approaching military strike against a foreign terrorist organization. If that journalist hadn't been a patriot, he could have given or sold that information and put American service members and intelligence informants at risk. Also it's obvious NO ONE in that chat had any idea that journalist was in the chat until he wrote his article about it WEEKS LATER. If he'd never written about it, they'd have never known, which begs the question, has anyone else mistakenly been added to other signal chats.  2. Hegseth had a second chat with members of his family and his personal lawyer sharing the same sensitive military information that was in the other signal chat. While everyone shares some blame for the previous chat, the real fault is with the person who created the chat and added the journalist. Here we just have Hegseth basically using his position to give information to friends and family who should have it. It completely kills any credibility he may have had and shows he has extremely poor decision making (something we all knew pre confirmation but whatever.)  3. Hegseth has wired an insecure Internet line into his work computer at the Pentagon so that he can use Signal from his computer... I repeat, the US Secretary of Defense has an insecure Internet line plugged into his work computer, a computer that is not meant to be plugged into an insecure line due to the information that is on it... God knows if anything on there has been hacked or not, we may never know until Trump is out of office.",Madpup70,2025-04-26T21:50:10,8

So get ready for everything to be more expensive because the fucking president of the united states doesn't even know what a tariff is and thinks it will cost foreign countries to pay us. When in reality once a Tariff is applied the business owner of the united states takes the hit and has to raise the price for every product imported.

And then you have the fact that a lot of government communication, classified or not but especially the not, is supposed to be subject to rigorous documentation and access through Freedom Of Informartion Act requests.

">Director of National Intelligence¬†Tulsi Gabbard¬†defended the¬†Trump administration‚Äôs use of Signal while also taking aim at¬†Biden-era officials for doing exactly the same in an interview Friday.  >‚ÄúLimited use of end-to-end encrypted apps like Signal is not only authorized under this administration, it was used prolifically under the Biden administration as well,‚Äù¬†Gabbard¬†said on¬†*Fox & Friends*.  >She added the platform remains ‚Äúthe most secure form of communication‚Äù provided it‚Äôs not used ‚Äúto communicate classified information‚Äù before going on to claim she had been ‚Äútold by people who have first-hand experience‚Äù that Biden administration officials like former National Security Adviser¬†and ex-Secretary of State¬†Jake Sullivan¬†and¬†Antony Blinken¬†‚Äúcommunicated prolifically and in great detail using the Signal app.‚Äù  >‚ÄúWhich is interesting,‚Äù she went on. ‚ÄúBecause the¬†Democrats¬†on the committee and the people who‚Äôve been talking about this have never questioned or acknowledged that fact, even though we know that they know.‚Äù  >Her comments come hot on the heels of a raft of embarrassing Signal-related leaks and blunders over the past few weeks.  >The so-called ‚ÄúSignalgate‚Äù scandal first broke last month after¬†*The Atlantic*‚Äôs editor-in-chief,¬†Jeffrey Goldberg, was accidentally added to a group chat on the messaging platform in which 17 top members of the Trump administration‚Äîincluding¬†Vice President JD Vance,¬†Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth,¬†Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Gabbard herself‚Äîshared highly sensitive details of imminent missile strikes against¬†Yemen.  >In the weeks since, it has also emerged that Hegseth¬†communicated further details¬†of those plans to his lawyer, brother, and wife via another secret group chat on the app, in addition to having¬†bypassed Pentagon security protocols¬†to install the messaging platform on his office computer.  >‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just practical,‚Äù Gabbard said of the White House‚Äôs continued use of the app. ‚ÄúWe have to be able to communicate, and that is the most secure way to communicate.

"She has the gall to try and shift the blame away from her own role in this fiasco, complaining about the Biden administration's oversight failures and cyber security policies. But at the same time, she's also downplaying the severity of this major breach of national security.  Inconsistencies aside, Gabbard is also conveniently ignoring the fact that the Trump administration has fired multiple department heads and top officials who were directly responsible for overseeing cybersecurity efforts.  They fired Timothy Haugh, head of the NSA and US cyber command. They also fired his deputy director, Wendy Noble, and previously fired Chris Krebs, the former chief of CISA, or the Cyber security and Infrastructure Security Agency, because he pushed back against Trump's election fraud lies in 2020.  They also fired General CQ Brown, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as part of a broader ""purge"" of top military leadership who were accused of being ""DEI"" hires.  How ironic considering that the DOD is currently run by the always incompetent Pete Hegseth, who is woefully unqualified for his position. It's evident that Hegseth wasn't hired based on ""merit"" but based on loyalty, favoritism and cronyism.  There's also the fact that the current administration has been taking actions to eliminate all areas of independent oversight while firing at least 17 inspectors general, and with the clear goal in mind to make the administration accountable to no one.  Not to mention that the Trump administration has been implementing an agenda‚Äîas laid out in Project 2025 of course‚Äîthat is stripping knowledgeable, qualified civil servants of their protections, and replacing them with MAGA loyalists.  What's more‚Äîand while this may be lesser known to the public‚Äîthe current admin has cut funding and staff for cybersecurity initiatives like the CVE database system. The CVE system identifies and catalogs cyber security vulnerabilities.  And this isn't even the half of it.  For years now, Trump and his allies have been politicizing cybersecurity, and to the benefit of our enemies. This is illustrated pretty damn thoroughly by the Trump administration's targeting of top officials who were only fired due to perceived disloyalty, and not because of their lack of experience or qualifications.  This is also made obvious by Trump's executive orders to revoke security clearances and his calls for investigating former staff.  When it comes to Trump's first term:  The previous Trump administration rolled back cybersecurity regulations and policies, leaving the country more vulnerable to attacks. They became ill-equipped to handle cyber security threats, and their response to major security breaches‚Äîlike the SolarWinds attack‚Äîwere wholly inadequate.  During Trump's 2016 run for president, he pleaded with the Russians to commence cyber attacks on US infrastructure and political opponents.  Throughout his 2016 campaign, Trump cast doubt on Russian cyber attacks, and at a news conference in July of that year, he asked Russia to hack the US  > ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,""  Within five hours of Trump saying those words, Russia's largest foreign intelligence service targeted Clinton's personal office for the first time  Trump capitalized off of Russia's meddling in the election, and he lent legitimacy to hacked emails so he could publicly attack Clinton on an almost daily basis. The Mueller report said Trump's campaign *""expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts""*  Trump has been downplaying the severity and threat of Russian cyber attacks and election meddling for years, Even siding with Putin over our own intelligence agencies on the matter.  Trump even proposed partnering directly with Russia on a cyber security taskforce. It received swift bipartisan backlash and Trump had to be reminded that Russia was responsible for repeated cyber attacks against the U.S.  Both the Mueller Report and a 2020 Republican led Senate panel revealed that Trump and his allies have continuously presented themselves as ""attractive counter-intelligence vulnerabilities.""  All that being said, Tulsi Gabbard has no ground to stand on considering her long list of conflicts of interests and her reputation as a Russian asset and national security threat  She's frequently peddled Russian propaganda and her interests overseas have been called into question.  She has echoed Putin's justifications for invading Ukraine, she's suggested that Ukraine is funding biological weapons labs, and she's also claimed that Ukraine is at fault for the war because of its engagement with NATO and its interest in self-determination.  Gabbard has also been targeting members of the intelligence community and referring them to the DOJ for  investigation because of the alleged threat they pose to Trump's policies.  Then there's her controversial meeting with Syria's ruthless dictator, Bashaar al-Assad, where she downplayed his use of chemical weapons, challenged his critics and the victims of his attacks, and even doubted US intelligence reports highlighting Assad'a brutal methods.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-26T17:42:47,1

"=== MAGA Decoder ===  It's not necessary for the believers to ""think"" this story is true. Stopping thought is the point. This is how the fash/MAGA controllers cauterize wounds in their bubble of unreality and keep the true believers inside and facts outside.  Blaming Biden, no matter how nonsensical, is a way for the believers to block out any other factual information on this subject, to shut down any conversation, and to protect the holy story of the world-historical greatness of MAGA.  It's sort of like a Thought Terminating Cliche. But it might be better to call this type of programmed reaction a Fact Blocker. The fash/MAGA propagandists will blast repeated messages in grievance media, social media, engineered memes, etc.  combined with carefully crafted emotional stimuli to install specific fact blockers in their willingly captive true believers.That may sound nuts but you have all seen it in action and been bewildered.  They do this when a story from the real world becomes big enough that it starts to bleed through into MAGA Fantasyworld.  When you try to talk to fash/MAGA believers about events in the real world -and they each shout the exact same slogans at you to halt the conversation and block any factual information - you are watching the installed fact blockers working as they are engineered.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-26T18:08:26,71

"Because they choose for loyalty to their leaders rather than for competency.  A competent leader understand they aren't competent in all areas. They leave people to their areas of competence. They defer decisions to the competent. That's not how the Trump administration works. In the Trump Administration, the leader makes the decisions and everyone else just follows. They are expected to use their competence to execute what the leader has decreed. But when what the leader has decreed is impossible to achieve because it is patently stupid, you're at an impasse.  That leads to stress and burnout. And eventually, all of your competent people will leave. That will leave you with people who are incapable of doing what you want, even if what you want is a decent idea.  It's similar to what the Republican party did to itself overall. They decided to court the low-information voter and to feed their paranoia. Just keep saying what they wanted and get the votes. Eventually, some genuine fucking idiots got in the mix. And it's inevitable. Because there's little difference superficially. Whether it's MTG crying about Jewish Space Lasers or Paul Ryan pushing ""Climategate"", it looks mostly the same to the low-information voter.  And it's even worse for the pretenders because the pretenders aren't *really* trying to win the culture war. They know it's bullshit and would cause a lot of issues to actually implement. They know it's an evergreen issue they can use to stoke their voters. However, the true-believers will actually try. That makes them even more appealing to the low-information voter.

"This has been their MO for the last decade now, but the point in which I had my boiling point was Jim Jordan during the Kavanaugh hearing and when Jim had his time to speak, basically stopped all discussion by going on a diatribe on how 'disgusting' this whole 'sham' is, and most importantly, framed the entire hearing as a waste of time, and that he called his wife to tell her not to watch it for that reason. He continued by saying ""***Anyone smart would have already turned off the TV or changed the channel by now, rather then give the Democratic Witch Hunt any time***""   This is inherently one of the most evil and malicious things I'd (at the time lol) ever heard a Republican say. Leveraging the fears of ostracization that permeate through Republican demographics because of religious upbringings, I can only imagine there were non-zero amounts of curious, and *very* impressionable, people that were watching and felt guilt, or worse, that they'd been wrong for giving the hearing any time.  This is weaponization of thought terminating rhetoric.

"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase ""Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

"> He showed embarrassment, not pride, during the Zelenskyy meeting.   Maybe I'm too cynical but from what I've read since then, I think he was embarrassed not because he didn't agree with it, but because he was confident Zelensky and his team would not have publicly rebuked his boss. This probably made him look foolish since I'm thinking he told Trump and Vance that Zelensky was probably open to whatever deal they had in mind no matter what.
