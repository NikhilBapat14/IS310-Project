"A ""conservative"" politician who supports mass migration isn't what motivates western voters in 2025.   He should have ran on a platform of mass deportation and an immigration moratorium. AfD became the most popular party in Germany this month, and this guy's talking about 250,000 more migrants a year.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-29T12:53:25,198
"This is extremely disappointing. Ultimately this is the fault of the Canadian people for choosing this- and they will 100% get what they voted for and all of the awful policies that will follow- but there’s also no denying that Trump’s rhetoric is what enabled this to happen.   As someone who voted for the guy 3 times I’m extremely fucking disappointed in Trump right now. We get to deal with lunatics living above us for potentially 5 more years. Not only that but now our upstairs neighbors will continue to censor speech, push their DEI crap, and open their borders. Canada is cooked and it’s the responsibility of the Canadian voters but Trump 100% played a role in this.",offensivetoaster,2025-04-29T12:32:00,85
"Probably good. He acted like he was MAGA but he was clearly establishment. This is the people who got us into this mess to begin with. When liberals started to go insane, they should have OPPOSED it. Instead they became half-liberals.",BobGoran_,2025-05-01T15:05:05,2

"Does a weak Canadian economy help or hurt the US? I’m not sure if this is the case, but if a weaker Canada under liberals makes it more reliant on the US, maybe that’s why Trump sandbagged the Canadian conservatives? Or is it the other way around? Is a stronger Canadian economy a better trading partner? If this is the case, I’m not sure why Trump would have underhandedly helped the liberals. 🤷‍♂️",stevieoats,2025-04-30T04:02:42,2

"This isn't Pierre's fault, or even Trump's fault, it's the fault of Canadian populace to cowardly to give being happy a chance and instead, enjoy being micro-managed into passive aggressive ruin by the forces of liberalism.      I have cousins in Canada who probably voted for Carney and I love them, but they just have this strange hatred of Trump, even more than the actual damage that Trudeau caused (who they hate as well.)",AldrichOfAlbion,2025-04-29T18:54:29,-9

"ok no questions but I am seeing a fair amount of upvotes so here's the summary.  A few months ago, the conservatives were on track towards a historical blow-out victory. Trudeau, our former Prime Minister, became hated by everyone. I couldn't find supporters even on Reddit believe it or not. At best, people felt neutral towards him. At worst, there were ""fuck trudeau"" flags hanging off trucks and in people's yards. It was relatively common.  Anyway, Trump started making those comments about the 51st state. This was the beginning of how all of this occurred. Canadians rallied around the liberal party, especially the boomers, simply as a way to ""stick it"" to Trump. They ran many TV ads equating Poilievre (our conservative leader) with Trump. These ads worked. Poilievre is very moderate by US standards and really shares no similarities with Trump but the ads were too effective. People grew to HATE Poilievre because of this comparison.   This was obviously all irrational nonsense, extreme over-reactions, but it is what it is. Carney, Trudeau's replacement, had the ability to call an election, and he timed it just right, where the Poilievre = Trump comparisons were at a high.   Liberals surged in the polls, not only taking from the conservative base, but also from the other leftist parties in Canada, who all rallied towards the liberals. Namely, our far-left party (the NDP), basically lost party status because they all flipped towards liberal.  NDP was a large-ish party, getting 15 - 25% of the vote, and i think they dropped to 7%.   Anyway, Trump can be blamed for this, because not only did he start with those comments but he kept doubling down on them as he witnessed what was occurring. He kept throwing gasoline on the fire. That's not to say it was all his fault; i am shocked and disgusted that Canadians were so easily toyed with after 10 economically disastrous years under the liberal government.  TLDR: Trump started a flame, added fuel to it, and Canadians were too stupid to ignore it. Canadians would rather harm themselves and their children just to PRETEND or FEEL as though they are ""gettin' Trump"". It's genuinely pathetic.",HelloBello30,2025-04-29T17:34:21,293
"Canadians are quick to blame Trump for this without discussing at all with themselves what the issues were with their ""conservative"" candidate. What was his platform exactly?   From what I've heard from friends in Canada, his platform was pretty much exactly the same as the other sides, only not as extreme. He was for the mass migration, he was against Trump, etc. he offered Canada no alternative other than ""liberal in blue""",arbiter_0115,2025-04-30T10:24:53,5

"hes not nearly conservative to hold those viewpoints. Played it safe and even started shouting anti-american sentiment. As if they pay for defense, and all the things they benefit from having the US nearby. The freeloaders gonna have a real awakening.",Stephan_Balaur,2025-04-29T13:44:48,36
"I hate to say I'm Canada were aren't that right wing. We are at best moderate Democrats. Pierre losing his seat was a result of Gerrymandering. The amount of votes the conservatives got this election, if NDP weren't deliberately shitting the bed, would have gotten us a majority any other election.    We can blame PP til we are blue in the face, fact is he outperformed, and that is what is sad. We are governed  by the whims of Toronto and Quebec. ",mattcruise,2025-04-29T16:47:16,19

"Yeah, this is probably one of the dumbest political developments we've seen in the past few years. So Canadians voted against the President of another country? And attempted to own MAGA by electing a politician 90% don't know or care about with any real depth? Your countrymen do know that Trump is still the President and that pretty much nobody in the U.S. cares  about Canada right?

"You hit the nail on the head imo, thank you for this. I genuinely wish you guys luck and hope your country wakes up & does a vote of no confidence if Carney ends up being Trudeau 2.0",offensivetoaster,2025-04-29T20:34:33,29

I doubt Pierre would have continued that insanity- he certainly wouldn’t do it to the level that Carney will. Canada is undoubtedly worse off now but hey that’s how they voted. Cool thing about elections is you get exactly what you deserve,offensivetoaster,2025-04-29T17:02:54,5

The problem was the 51st state stuff. I’m 100% on board with the initial tariffs but him doubling and tripling down on the 51st state line is ridiculous. I’m still glad the guy won but that doesn’t mean he’s exempt from criticism,offensivetoaster,2025-04-29T13:09:45,76
"If you look at the polls/voter responses then yes, the gap narrowed after Justin dropped out but the anti-American sentiment by Carney & the implicit association of Pierre as a Trump sympathizer made a massive difference as well. There is zero getting around the fact that Trump’s actions & rhetoric caused a lot of vitriol to form in the Canadian populace which then enabled the anti Trump candidate to pick up more support.",offensivetoaster,2025-04-29T17:01:12,18
"Yes, basically.",HelloBello30,2025-04-30T10:31:56,5
"Fair enough, and I agree, no one should be immune to criticism.  Even the man I voted for does not have my blind devotion.   I think my response was more at, why would any of Trump's comments (whether 51st state or tariffs) affect a change in what seemed to be much support for Poilievre?  I am honestly not understanding what would cause the momentum change for Poilievre's run?  If it was because he ""suddenly"" jumped on the Trump train and he wanted Canada to become our 51st state, and that scared Canadian voters, well then I might give that some weight (and to your point, that just makes their electorate deserve what they get), but I still do not understand why Poilievre's loss is because of Trump's words, or rhetoric.  Submitted with respect.",Ida_PotatHo,2025-04-29T13:59:07,-14
"Wrong again. Little PP campaigned on nothing but ""I'm not Trudeau"" and ending the carbon tax. Then Trudeau dropped out and Carney announced he was ending the carbon tax himself.  Instead of trying to offer real, substantial differences between himself and Carney after that, PP just floundered and had nothing.  Trump had been talking about tariffs and making 51st state jokes long before this all happened, yet the polls only started shifting afterwards.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-29T17:16:22,-6
