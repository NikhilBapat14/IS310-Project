"I have been posting 4-5 times daily on FB about Trump and his administration.  I have not been holding back.  I made it clear I did not care whose feelings I hurt, or whose feathers I ruffled.  Silence is complicity.  Some of my MAGA family are not happy.  My sister sent me a rather terse text.  She said she didn't like what I was doing.  I told her I don't like having an adjudicated sex offender and convicted felon as president.  She stopped texting after that.  I have no idea if any of the people who would really benefit from my posts are actually reading them.  I know they are reading the comments I post, because I have been very outspoken about my feelings.  I have asked if we have any racists in the family.  I called out the homophobia.  I called out the lack of critical thinking.  I called out the hypocrisy of those who claim to be Christians.    Your post shows how important it is for them to seek other news sources.  I am not going to be silent.  There is too much at stake.",One-Low1033,2025-04-03T20:49:55,23
