"It's going to hurt the parents, at least the caring ones.  After all, their kids are going to have to go under anesthesia again and again.  Totally avoidable, and not healthy for the kids.",insuproble,2025-05-06T13:20:10,18
"Of all the things I've read today, this thread is the most disappointing. Not the article per se, the comments.   So many people who do not seem to understand the concept of public health. Everybody drinks water or they die so almost all of them drink some or lots of tap water. They use tap water to make food and so forth.   Fluoride in water has enormous dental health benefits. Huge. For any population but it's especially important for a country with no national health care and that treats teeth as though they're not attached to your body. Well proven. Therapeutic doses have no downsides.   Saying that it doesn't matter or there's fluoride in toothpaste or parents who care will make it up somehow etcetera misses the point.   This and 10,000 other ways that they are damaging public health will get us a less healthy population that will require additional money, public or private, to go to more expensive treatments etc.   Less educated and less healthy populations make the entire country bad. Don't let your privilege think you get to avoid the consequences of these decisions.",shoobe01,2025-05-06T17:13:58,11

"Actually, I doubt that the removal of fluoride from public water supplies will end up being a serious detriment for parents who are actually willing to protect their children's health with a modicum of effort. I think that some entrepreneur or public health philanthropist will begin producing and distributing supplements that will easily replace that fluoride that is lost due to stupid political decisions. Someone will come up with little supplement pills, 500 to a bottle, each containing the 1.5 mg of sodium fluoride (NaF) per tablet required to replace the dentist-recommended amount of fluoride - 0.7 mg per liter - in your children's drinking water.    At current prices for USP-grade (food and drug grade - 99.9+% pure) of around $40 per pound, a pound of the stuff could treat about 300,000 liters of water for a wholesale cost of less than $0.02 per 100 liters treated. (We'll see whether producers will decide to grift us in terms of profits on a very inexpensive raw material.)  The upshot in this comment, then, is that for parents wanting to mitigate any harm done by stupid politicians gaslighting the public regarding fluoride, the fix will be cheap and only a little inconvenient for you and your children. It's those kids whose parents either don't care about the issue or are too stupid to listen to any real science about it whom you should focus on - help educate their parents about avoiding stupidity regarding their children's health.",phosdick,2025-05-06T15:30:17,-7

"That's true for levels of fluoride higher than what's found in US water supplies, so the only effect we'll see is bad teeth.",snoo_spoo,2025-05-06T13:33:26,10
Not true.  Studies show a much higher rate of cavities that require the kids to put under.,insuproble,2025-05-06T13:35:45,13

Interesting. In the states most bottled water contains minimal amounts of naturally occurring fluoride. There are only a handful of bottled waters that add enough fluoride to prevent cavities.,wiscopup,2025-05-06T16:36:23,3
"I do sometimes, but I prefer not to. I have lead pipes in my house, and our water infrastructure has a lot of lead pipes that need to be replaced. The lead levels are presumed to be low, but I don’t necessarily believe they are.  I do it as a precaution, and because I’ve known people to have sensitivity to the water in my city. And as USA slowly collapses under the weight of greed and dysfunction, I want to avoid being a part of the collateral damage if I can.",Ashamed-of-my-shelf,2025-05-06T19:16:18,-4
"What??????  I said that flouride in tap water doesn’t affect people who do not drink tap water.  Maybe all the lead in the tap water finally made its way to your brain and is attacking the last two brain cells you had left? I was never rude to you, and I wasn’t wrong. I’m not anti flouride either.",Ashamed-of-my-shelf,2025-05-06T16:40:45,-1
"I just checked, and you are right that the fluoride levels in bottled water are actually less than other countries. I didn’t know that.  Gotta worry about metals and chemicals in our water, ontop of the plastic that’s building up in my balls. It never ends… I’m just trying to project myself and my family.  I’ve been looking for a *good* BIFL water purifier, one that adds minerals back in, and all the options just make my head spin.  Anyway, personally, I’m not really that concerned with fluoride. I’m more concerned about getting shot.",Ashamed-of-my-shelf,2025-05-06T16:48:56,-1
