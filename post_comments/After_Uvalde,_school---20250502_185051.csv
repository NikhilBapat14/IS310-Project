"If republicans in congress grew a pair they wouldn’t allow the president to control the budget. It’s their power, not his. They are pathetic.",hdiggyh,2025-05-02T19:06:50,17
"If violence from guns in these settings is a mental health issue, which I actually do agree with at least to some extent, why aren't we investing to support and aid with mental health issues in schools",blues111,2025-05-02T19:13:34,8
Maybe the Republicans were just taking a performative stance on mental health so they didn’t have to take a stance on guns.,jcouball,2025-05-02T19:27:51,4
At least we can all agree that this is Biden’s fault,Inner_Competition_31,2025-05-02T19:24:55,2
"Schools will likely have to lay off social workers and counselors, and college programs designed to train mental health providers may shut down after the Trump administration decided it would stop funding grants created under a bipartisan law passed in response to mass school shootings.  The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act came on the heels of the devastating 2022 school shooting in Uvalde, Texas where an 18-year-old gunman killed 19 elementary schoolers and two teachers. Gun control remains a deeply divisive issue, but Democrats and Republicans agreed: Schools should get more money to address students’ mental health needs. They set aside $1 billion to do that.  When it came time to distribute that money, the Biden administration gave applicants the option to show how they planned to diversify the mental health profession and prepare educators to work with kids from diverse backgrounds — in a bid to help students who often have higher needs but struggle to access care outside of school. Now schools that tailored their proposals to meet that criteria appear to be among those losing their funding.",chalkbeat,2025-05-02T18:51:21,1
"Mental health has a negative effect on their constituencies. They need more racists and angry incels, not less.",Hpfanguy,2025-05-03T02:41:22,1
They have a pair they are supporting this.   This is the same party who was happier than pigs playing in shit when they got the burn bill for vets initially overturned.   This is also the same party who doesn't do anything when school shootings happen.,Festering-Fecal,2025-05-02T23:51:35,2
"No, they don’t believe in representative government. They are all just competing for who trump will like most",samsquamchy,2025-05-03T01:08:54,2
