"Before the inevitable people saying we elected a minority government, keep in mind our last government with Trudeau was a minority government and we had to caucus with both the NDP (Left wing party. Think Bernie and AOC types) and the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois (A party thatâ€™s only really active in Quebec and advocates specifically for Quebec).  In this election not only did the Liberals gain seats but they picked up 169 seats which is just shy of the 172 needed for a majority. This time theyâ€™ll be able to caucus with just the NDP which is further left of the Liberals.  Not only that but Carney is the only major party leader who actually kept his seat.   All in all itâ€™s been a fantastic election for the Liberals who were projected to lose in a blowout only a few months ago, and itâ€™s disingenuous to suggest otherwise.",RetroBowser,2025-04-29T15:51:31,29
"Iâ€™m really struggling to think of a comparable bag fumble to what the CPC just pulled off.  *Maybe* Dewey in 1948, but even thatâ€™s pushing it.   To compare, this is like if we had polling in the summer of 2016 that had a national environment where Hillary Clinton was in serious play in Tennessee and then lost.  What Poilievre managed here is an order of magnitude worse than 2016, easily.",ScotTheDuck,2025-04-29T15:56:14,6

This has less to do with the liberals and more to do with NDP and Bloc voters realizing they need to sacrifice in order to not endure a Conservative government who under any other circumstance would have had an absolute super majority with 42% of the vote,dontgivetohitchcock,2025-04-29T16:13:32,11
"PP losing his seat is kind of hilarious.   But isn't that done with a by-election?Â  What if someone gives up their seat for him, but it ends up flipping to the Liberals?Â  Even more hilarious.",Phoenixlizzie,2025-04-29T17:54:49,3

"Not quite.  A few are close enough to require recounts.  Elections Canada says 75382 of 75479 polls have reported, so not done, but 99.87%.  A couple seats *may* flip, but not enough to change the overall results.

"The Quebec result, anecdotes from voters, and even Blanchet confirmed that overwhelmingly, QC has never felt more Canadian.  The separatist movement there is tamped down again, for now.  And Blamchet today, during his conference, even seemed to hint at pathways that ease the tensions.    I am in ON, and I can't speak for them.  But these are all positives and should be leveraged.",Postom,2025-04-29T16:17:14,6
