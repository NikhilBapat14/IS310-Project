"By John Kruzel April 7, 20253:51 PM PDT  WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court handed Donald Trump a victory on Monday by letting him use a 1798 law that historically has been employed only in wartime to swiftly deport alleged Venezuelan gang members as part of the Republican president's hardline approach to immigration.  The court granted the administration's request to lift Washington-based U.S. Judge James Boasberg's March 15 order that had temporarily blocked the summary deportations under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act while litigation in the case continues.  Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on March 15 to swiftly deport the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, attempting to speed up removals with a law best known for its use to intern Japanese, Italian and German immigrants during World War Two.  In a legal challenge handled by the American Civil Liberties Union, a group of Venezuelan men in the custody of U.S. immigration authorities on the same day sued on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, seeking to block the deportations. They argued, among other things, that Trump's order exceeded his powers because the Alien Enemies Act authorizes removals only when war has been declared or the United States has been invaded. The Alien Enemies Act authorizes the president to deport, detain or place restrictions on individuals whose primary allegiance is to a foreign power and who might pose a national security risk in wartime.  Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, temporarily blocked the deportations. But Trump's administration allowed two planes already in the air to continue to El Salvador where American officials handed 238 Venezuelan men over to Salvadoran authorities to be placed in the Central American country's ""Terrorism Confinement Center.""  The judge also has scrutinized whether the Trump administration violated his order by failing to return the deportation flights after his order was issued. Justice Department lawyers said the flights had left U.S. airspace by the time Boasberg issued a written order and thus were not required to return. They dismissed the weight of Boasberg's spoken order during a hearing two hours earlier calling for any planes carrying deportees to be turned around. Trump's administration has argued that Boasberg's temporary ban encroached on presidential authority to make national security decisions.  On March 18, Trump called for Boasberg's impeachment by Congress - a process that could remove him from the bench - drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump on social media called Boasberg, who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2011 in a bipartisan 96-0 vote, a ""Radical Left Lunatic"" and a ""troublemaker and agitator.""  The D.C. Circuit upheld Boasberg's order after holding a contentious hearing that involved heated language. Judge Patricia Millett told Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign that ""Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here."" Ensign responded, ""We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy.""  Family members of many of the deported Venezuelan migrants deny the alleged gang ties. Lawyers for one of the deportees, a Venezuelan professional soccer player and youth coach, said U.S. officials had wrongly labeled him a gang member based on a tattoo of a crown meant to honor his favorite team, Real Madrid.

The decision was mostly based on a technicality: Filing the petition in the wrong court (DC instead of Texas).  The Court did actually say that the detainees are supposed to get due process though and must be notified of their pending deportation so they can file petitions to the courts. That part was a rebuke of the process the Trump administration has been using.  >Today’s order and per curiam confirm that the detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal. The only question is which court will resolve that challenge.,SwimmingThroughHoney,2025-04-07T18:26:52,1

"No, they weren't already doing it. This article is about how there was a court order preventing the government from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport people, and the government had stopped doing so while their challenge to it worked through the courts.  Prior to that court order, Trump deported one wave of people to an El Salvadoran prison under the AEA and, when he did so, he violated their due process rights as they had no way to challenge that deportation.  After this current court order, Trump has been told that he can't go back to deporting people without them being able to challenge it. If he wants to deport people under the AEA, they have to be able to challenge that in court.  This court order also explicitly does not rule on whether these people are subject to the AEA itself; it rules that people deported under the AEA still need to be given due process rights and that those challenges need to occur in the correct court.  If the Supreme Court wanted to allow Trump to continue using the AEA without due process requirements they could have simply dismissed the first court order due to the technical issue of being in the wrong jurisdiction, so the fact they explicitly added the ""give them due process rights"" clarification seems like a pretty strong rebuke.  It's not as good as if the Supreme Court had ruled that Trump can't use the AEA at all, and as a result of this the AEA challenge will need to go back further through the courts, but it's still not a complete win by the Trump team.",LangyMD,2025-04-07T19:53:08,1
