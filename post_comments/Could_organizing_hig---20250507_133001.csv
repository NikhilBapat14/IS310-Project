"The logistics of this would be difficult. How many basketball teams is Allen H.S. in Texas going to have to field before the first female gets a spot on a team? You talking 5th or 6th team. Same with track, take 100m dash. Elite Women run around only a little over 1 second slower than elite men but there would still likely be at least 20 males at large high school between elite men and the elite women. You are going to fill up varsity, JV, B team C team with men before you start getting women on a team. And then what? One elite female playing on a team with all boys? Would star and get a scholarship to college on a girls' team, but rides bench on a team with all other males.",nan0agressor,2025-05-07T22:21:21,68

"Girls often play on the same baseball/basketball/flag football/soccer teams as boys between 5-12ish. As an 8U baseball coach I’ve seen some really talented 6-8yo girls who were better than some boys on the team; like able to fire a ball across the diamond from 3B to 1B for an out at 8yo.  However, post-puberty is where things change. I’ve seen boys who were clumsy & slow suddenly have everything start clicking post-puberty. I’ve seen stud 10 year olds suddenly see the pack catch up to them. It’s like nature’s super soldier serum.   Aside from the occasional genetic freaks of nature female athletes, like the types who go on to play in the Olympics or are MVP-caliber in D1 sports, most female athletes would still be the weakest athletes on their respective freshmen co-ed teams.  There’s also the issue of there already being different sports for different genders; Baseball vs Softball.   I’ll use baseball because it’s a sport that’s more skill-focused vs raw strength & also has the most variance in pro athlete size (Jose Altuve famously being only 5’6” but being a consistent HR hitter).  Women have tried baseball before & just don’t have the shoulder strength to pitch unless they were a scrappy knuckleballer or sidearm pitcher. I think only one woman has ever pitched in AAA but I could be mistaken. With hitting I don’t think people appreciate how much core strength it takes to even break 80mph exit velocity. There’s a handful of bombers in the D1 & professional Softball ranks but I don’t think any of them would be able to hit a baseball further than 290’ ish; again because of how much bat speed is required.   If you pick a sport like basketball or soccer, I think you’d have to go down farther than you think to find boys unathletic enough to pair up with 80% of female athletes. The 20% elite female athletes could be competitive with some JV or even Varsity boys but any elite boy on a D1 path would make fools of any female player who isn’t the next Alex Morgan or Caitlin Clark.  Golf is the only sport where I think this works perfectly at the HS levels but it’s so much more about skill than athleticism. The boys would still hit it farther but they have tees to solve for that.  Anyways, I think the thing you should consider is every great athlete deserves to have the opportunity to excel at their sport if they put the effort in. Your proposed model would potentially take that away from some people because they would get graduated up to a level where they physically/biologically could never compete.",ashdrewness,2025-05-07T21:15:02,69
"No. The whole point of having women’s sports to start with, or at least the best reason for it, was to allow women to excel in their own leagues instead of being mixed up with men who were less determined and talented but just happened to have a genetic advantage.   In some sports there isn’t much reason for gender segregation. Chess, or ultramarathon, to pick two. But in singles tennis, for example, the best female players ever can barely compete at men’s club level, in spite of being far more accomplished athletes. The specifics should be left to governing bodies.",No-Wrongdoer-7654,2025-05-07T21:19:13,52
"Yeah, what Colorado's trying to do with letting trans athletes compete is cool and all, but seriously, the number of trans athletes actually competing nationwide is likely less than 100 right now. So it feels kinda like they're just trying to look good, you know? Meanwhile, half the country is busy trying to block trans people at every turn. It's just wild how much legislation they're pushing for such a small percentage of the population. You'd think they'd have bigger fish to fry, you know, focus on other real problems. I'm not trying to knock the politicians trying to be inclusive with the sports thing, but it just feels like that's not the main thing they should be focusing on. I mean, a way bigger deal is how trans kids can be targeted in general, you know?   Honestly, I think the anti-trans stuff is all just political theater. Like, those politicians don't actually give a crap about trans folks. It's just a way to score points with their base and it's easy to get their base riled up because of otherism. I mean look at people like Nancy Mace. Up until she discovered how it helps with her fundraising. She claimed to support that community now she's one of the biggest anti-trans advocates in Congress. The lack of principles is shameful They're playing games with people's lives. And honestly, if you're gonna make laws for the trans community, it feels like a no-brainer to actually, you know, involve trans people in the conversation. Especially because those laws are based on things that aren't necessarily factual or even happening.",FirmLifeguard5906,2025-05-07T23:42:31,22
"Short answer: not really.   Even if you did you’d end up with situations that would seem just as unfair.   With very few exceptions, the gap between male and female athletes is much larger than the variation within genders.   There’s also typically a large gap between seniors and freshman.   Segregating by gender and age gives athletes a chance to play against similarly skilled opponents in a “fair” way.   Freshman play against other freshman, JV plays against JV, Varsity vs Varsity.   At the Varsity level, some sports even segregate divisions based off school size or performance.   Would it be more fair to have the best female seniors compete and lose against middle of the road JV boys?    Do you really think girls want to play on JV boys teams rather than their own varsity teams?  Any way you try to do it, girls lose out.",slayer_of_idiots,2025-05-07T23:42:14,5
"Some sports are already like that. Table tennis has a ranking system and in tournaments you play by rank for example 1800-2000 vs gender and male or female at the same rank will be equally competitive. At the club level it's really a non issue and I train with men or women. There is still a women's bracket as the physical divide widens at higher levels.   I think the bigger step back is what are we looking to achieve with sports? The vast majority of student athletes aren't going pro or getting scholarships, so I guess the question is what age we trying to accomplish? Is it just who is the best? Is it about hard work and growth, physical exercise?   To me some of this feels like civil rights ""we can't have black athletes playing in the same league"".    I don't have an answer but the outrage feels disproportionate. Trans people make up less than 1% of the population and Its absurd to think we'll have a future where only trans women are on the podium. ",metarinka,2025-05-07T23:05:16,6

"When I was in high school I ran about 15-15:30 3 mile. The fastest girls were running 12 minute 2 miles. Also women’s lacrosse has no contact… it’s just not feasible to go gender neutral as women aren’t as strong as men, and while some can keep up… your average male will be among the top of women.  Not even volleyball gets played the same between men and women. Maybe golf? But women aren’t driving the ball as far.  I don’t think letting transgender play with preferred groups is that big of a deal though. Trans people are not going to be scouted and if a person is good enough to go to the next level the 1 trans gendered person the that city isn’t going to take that away from them.",bigmac22077,2025-05-07T23:10:33,5
Absolutley not.  Women need a female only category in order to ever win high level competitions and this must be a consistent category that persists at all levels in order to have meaning.,FizzixMan,2025-05-07T22:35:03,7
"No, this will just make even more people feel bad about themselves and relegate most female athletes to lower levels of competition, which would pretty much destroy women's potential for athletic scholarships into colleges. It's really not hard to keep trans women out of women's sports and is an incredibly logical opinion to have regardless of your views on broader trans rights. Fighting for trans women in women's sports is a losing issue that I wish the left would give up on already, we are allowed to admit that we are sometimes wrong and the right is correct.",lionhearted318,2025-05-07T21:01:31,11
Not a good idea. Have a women’s league for biological women and an open league for anyone. Done.,repeatoffender123456,2025-05-07T22:39:32,6
"The rub isn't the factor we use to divide the teams, it's the concentration of each principal gender in each division.  As biological males and females are going to differ by different amounts of each sport, this isn't going to be a consistent graduation.  For some sports, an entity might be able to achieve a predominantly female bracket in short order.  In others males may dominate for several divisions.  In still others, top tier females may end up competing with only mid or bottom tier males.  It really ain't fair to those women who are undoubtedly premier athletes in their own right, to have to compete with a different tier of male athletes.  The simple truth is that men and women *are* different.  As it often happens, we tend to rank ourselves physically, and often men come out on top.  Refusing to acknowledge or assess that means that women will always be competing on a different scale, against a different foe.  And, they'll be demonstrating a ridiculous amount of athletic talent just to remain afloat among men who would otherwise be described as barely athletic.  As a bell curve would demonstrate, this insistence on integration will only serve to diminish even further the amazing accomplishments and skills that female athletics have to offer and show to the world.",ValiantBear,2025-05-08T13:12:10,2

"No.  Just keep biological men out of women’s sports.    “ Current policies regulating the inclusion of transgender women in sport are based on the premise that reducing testosterone to levels found in biological females is sufficient to remove many of the biologically-based performance advantages described above. However, peer-reviewed evidence suggests that this is not the case, and particularly that the reduction in total mass, muscle mass, and strength variables of transgender women may not be sufficient in order to remove the differences between males and females, and thus assure other participants of safety or fairness in competition. Based on the available evidence provided by studies where testosterone is reduced, the biological variables that confer sporting performance advantages and create risks as described previously appear to be only minimally affected. Indeed, most studies assessing mass, muscle mass and/or strength suggest that the reductions in these variables range between 5% and 10% (as described by Hilton & Lundberg [10]). Given that the typical male vs female advantage ranges from 30% to 100%, these reductions are small and the biological differences relevant to sport are largely retained. With respects to strength, 1 year of testosterone suppression and estrogen supplementation has been found to reduce thigh muscle area by 9% compared to baseline measurement [35]. After 3 years, a further reduction of 3% from baseline measurement occurred [36]. The total loss of 12% over three years of treatment meant that transgender women retained significantly higher thigh muscle size (p<0.05) than the baseline measurement of thigh muscle area in transgender men (who are born female  and experience female puberty), leading to a conclusion that testosterone suppression in transgender women does not reverse muscle size to female levels [36] Transgender women retained a 17% grip-strength advantage over transgender men at baseline measurement, with a similarly large, retained advantage when compared to normative data from a reference or comparison group of biological females. Most recently, Wiik et al found that isokinetic knee extension and flexion strength were not significantly reduced in 11 transgender women after 12 months of testosterone suppression, with a retained advantage of 50% compared to a reference group of biological females and the group of transgender men at baseline”",FightSmartTrav,2025-05-07T20:52:20,4

"I kind of love this idea, and it was more or less what athletic extracurriculars approximated when I was a kid (GenX) anyway.  There was the varsity team and the junior varsity team, but also the ""B-team"" and the ""C-team"" where kids were assigned according to ability.  There was some of the usual teen angst bullshit over being on the ""C-team"" because the kids knew what was what.  Nobody liked being ranked among the worst.  But in the grand scheme of things it really didn't matter.  Everyone had more important things to worry about.  Also, our cross-country team was too small to make division by gender make sense anyway, so the boys trained with the girls and it was a huge non-issue.  The *competitions* were gender-divided, but in retrospect I don't see that it could have mattered.  Everyone had their own goals they wanted to achieve, so it didn't matter if boys outperformed the girls (though that was not a given!) because everyone was racing against the clock, not the place.

"To me I think it's simple; let the sports adresss the issue themselves. Every sport and sport governing body should decide on their particular priorities around fairness, competition, fan enjoyment, etc.   If chess wants to have separate men and women categories, go right ahead. If they want to add an ""Open"" category or replace men's category with open category, that's their decision.    Same with swimming, track and field, baseball, softball etc.   If the top level governing body wants to limit or allow steroids, or has guidelines for hormones, that should be there choice.

"I think a great context for these discussions is a clear cut example of how significant the difference is in athleticism once you get into the teenage years.  In 2017 - the FC Dallas U-15 boys beat the US Women's National Team 5-2 in a scrimmage.   That is a World Championship caliber roster of professional women soccer players losing to 14 year old boys. So no - this idea will not work at all.   Let's imagine 24 roster spots for two basketball teams at a school where our goal is not boys and girls but instead A and B based purely on merit and ability.      So when 40 boys and 40 girls show up for tryouts, you end up with two rosters made up only of boys. That's obviously unworkable.   OK - so maybe we say no, you have to pick 12 boys and 12 girls we're just going to assign the teams based on ability. You happen have to have a single elite girl who can make the bench of the A team. Instead of a dominating HS career, she's a role player who gets limited minutes. How did this benefit her in any way?  The boy who got demoted down to the B team is the equivalent of the elite girl. So he absolutely dominates games against girls. Yay.  This makes absolutely no sense on any level for competitive sports post puberty. Anyone trying to make it make sense is desperate to force a square peg fit in a round hole to rationalize a moral belief that they can't defend on facts.   I truly empathize with trans athletes who just want to compete and be part of a team.  I think a moral panic around this stuff is terrible. But reality is reality on this issue. Trying to create hyper-complex solutions to accommodate a tiny fraction of individuals in a way that's ""fair"" to everyone else is never going to be the right path.

">But in singles tennis, for example, the best female players ever can barely compete at men’s club level, in spite of being far more accomplished athletes.  Not to mention that in tennis, women's tennis and men's tennis are played differently using different strategies to appeal to natural biological advantages. In men's tennis the most powerful move is the serve, because men can serve incredibly fast and stronger than women, whereas in women's tennis the most powerful move is the return, because women's serves are weaker and are more easily attacked aggressively. The average first serve speed is about 10-20 mph slower for women than for men in professional tennis.  Women players struggle to play men because they are not used to having to return serves that are hit at that fast a speed, so their return game crumbles. Meanwhile, men are not used to having to return serves hit at that slow a speed, so they can aggressively attack nearly every serve hit at them.",lionhearted318,2025-05-07T22:13:09,23
"Yes, this wouldn't help. But performance isn't the issue with trans athletes. They don't compete at a male level, and their competitiveness at the women's level simply isn't the driving force.  If a trans athlete got dead last in an event, people would still be upset that they were at the event or that they took a spot from a cisgender athlete.  The primary issue is disgust and fear, combined with a heady dose of opportunism by the right. Those are why this is a moral panic. And such a panic is going to be act irrationally.  It doesn't matter if the best female players are competitive with men in a sport, or whether trans athletes have abilities comparable to men. What matters is that the issue gets under people's skins and provokes an emotional response. This stays the same no matter the level of competition.

"This is why the question ""what is a woman"" is not actually a gotcha, but a real chance for introspection. (Unfortunately those asking this question are usually the last to engage in critical thought or theory.)  Is a woman an ""adult human female""? Or is a woman ""someone who fulfils a feminine societal role""? No one - not even the most fervent trans person - believes ""trans women are biologically female"" or ""trans men are biologically male"". There is a difference between gender and sex, and surprise surprise - our society (in America, at least) doesn't actually inspect for sex when interacting with someone. This is why the ""adult human female"" definition is a flawed one.  We, as a society, look at an individuals' gender expression in order to understand whether they are feminine, masculine, or neither. This is why people label intentional and persistent misgendering as bigotry. We don't actually evaluate cis individuals in our day-to-day life, checking their genitals and chromosomes - but instead we group them into a gender based on our societal norms and expectations.  There is a deeper conversation to be had about passing, and the role it plays in gender arguments (let alone race) - but that's a level of nuance beyond addressing 'bigotry', and a bit out of scope for this response.  I don't think most people are operating out of a place of insidious bigotry, but I do think most people do not have a functional understanding of sex versus gender. We, as a society, actually care way more about gender than we do about sex.

"He's actually saying both things.   He's claiming the fairness argument is insincere because ""society"" will not allow trans-women to participate in sports regardless.   But he doesn't know that. A significant majority of people - 66% in recent polling - say they don't want trans-women competing on women's sports teams. There's no way he knows people's true motives for responding that way.   In itself this is a silly argument and not worth responding to - its just ""I know for certain people I disagree with hold their views for bad reasons so I will ignore them"". Fine. Whatever. This is where we ended up at the bottom of the thread.  Its not necessary, in order to claim these nation-spanning telepathic powers, to also claim that the fairness argument is wrong, but it does help. Its more plausible that no-one really believes fairness is the issue if in fact fairness isn't an issue at all. And in fact u/ManBearScientist didn't just claim that fairness isn't an issue in practice (which is the usual argument), but that fairness in sports doesn't matter at all, not just in this one comment but several times.   I actually think that's interesting, which is why I pressed the issue. The argument that fairness doesn't matter in practice is really quite weak - any sport that depends on reach or height or lung capacity, merely suppressing testosterone levels doesn't necessarily make any difference - but the argument that fairness is arbitrary and the current limits are arbitrary and can be changed might be much stronger. I wasn't being entirely flippant when I suggested that Lance Armstrong did nothing wrong. There's a perfectly reasonable argument that since almost all top level cyclists probably dope, we should just change the rules and regulate it to protect their health.

"Colloquially, we've identified sub-genders for quite a while now: tomboy for girls, pansy for boys (and I should know, I was called one). That's not a gender expression I chose - but instead was foisted onto me by society due to my mannerisms and speech.  It's funny to me, seeing this acceptance of gender-flexibility within defined sex - but then when someone actually chooses to identify with their gender rather than their sex - it causes (according to you) mainstream rejection. This just reeks of out-group bullying, rather than an outright rejection of the difference between sex and gender.  I disagree with your source of the non-reception to trans people. I think the source is a reactionary, regressive conservative politic that needs an 'icky', easily misunderstood boogeyman to rally behind. First, it was black americans, then Irish americans, then Italian americans, then gays and lesbians - then the muslim population, and now it seems to have moved onto transgender individuals.

To me, it's illuminating to see the media's response to the first transgender servicememeber, [Christine Jorgensen](https://cfshrc.org/article/there-is-no-question-about-this-and-there-never-has-been-for-eight-years-the-public-reception-of-christine-jorgensen/) waaaay back in 1952. This is actually an interesting source, because they evaluate the historical text from a modern lens, which is often full of misgendering and casting doubts on her transition... but holy fuck does the level of empathy and a real attempt at understanding her lived experience put our modern media to shame.  If media didn't tell people to care about transgender individuals - they wouldn't care about them until they interact with a transgender person.

">But he doesn’t know that.    Actually, we do know that. The status quo was letting sports figure it out themselves, using science and experimentation to find a fair compromise. Now, bigotry overrides expert judgment, precisely because society doesn’t trust that fair competition is possible.   We’ve shifted from fairness based on science to bans based on panic.   Take this example: trans women are banned from fencing, chess, E-sports, and even women’s modeling.   [Fencing](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trans-fencer-sports-interview-1235315722/): Women compete directly against men regularly in fencing. Yet a woman who placed high (8th of 32) in a men’s event a week prior refused to face a trans woman that finished 24th out of 39 in a women’s tournament.    [Chess](https://www.npr.org/2023/08/18/1194593562/chess-transgender-fide-pushback) and [E-sports](https://www.thepinknews.com/2017/05/05/transgender-women-banned-from-tournament-and-told-no-males-allowed/): These don’t involve physical advantages, yet trans women are still banned. Women’s divisions here exist for social inclusion, but trans women are excluded precisely because of social discomfort rather than not logic or fairness.   [Modeling](https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/culture_society/alex-consani-model-of-the-year-transgender-anok-yai-woke/): Trans model Alex Consani was named Model of the Year and faced backlash. Critics claimed a man had “stolen” a woman’s award, even in a field where trans women often face disadvantages. That reaction shows this isn’t about fairness; it’s about exclusion.   This isn’t like banning Lance Armstrong after cheating. It’s declaring him ineligible before the race starts. Trans women aren't allowed to win, period. If they do, their success is dismissed as unfair regardless of the rules they followed or the evidence presented.   The moral panic overrides any rational or evidence-based policy. We had tools for fairness. Instead, we chose exclusion.   Why? Because many don’t want trans women to compete at all. No policy will ever be ""fair enough"" to those who think trans women don’t belong.   In a fair world, “Transgender girl wins track meet” would mean the same thing as “Local girl wins track meet.” But in reality, only one of those headlines is treated as legitimate.

"You might want to edit your comment to remove the duplication.  First, I agree with you that governing bodies should make the decisions about who competes in men's and women's contests based on expert opinion, and if those decisions are being made instead based on political considerations or even public pressure that contradicts expert opinion, that's strong evidence for your claim that fairness is irrelevant to the public's views on this.

That is sad but it is the truth. This idea would destroy women's sports, preventing women from receiving athletic scholarships to college or discouraging them from pursuing sports entirely.

"Women's sports, as a topic, has always been an issue with conservatives, even long since before Title  IX and before women had separate leagues. You don't see this as much now, *I think*, but one of the oldest conservative arguments against women playing in competitive sports was that it would make them less fertile/infertile. There was also a point some would argue that it would make women masculine in a way that's analogous to transitioning. I'd like to think that those objections were dropped because athletic women were still having kids as easily as non-athletes and also not literally turning into men. Ironically, there was one person in the early 1900s that competed with cis men, in...I think a race of some sort? Anyway they did really well, so there was backlash claiming that they couldn't possibly be a woman and do that well, so they must have been a man. Some time later, that runner actually transitioned (FtM)--I don't know if people took that as proof that they were a ""biological male"" all along, but it's worth pointing out that the current trans sports panic is just old fearmongering making a comeback while wearing a different outfit.   Fast forward a bit and now women's sports teams are a much more common thing. What angle did conservatives take after Title IX became official? ""Title IX is a lesbian bill of rights."" I don't know how well the homophobia angle worked, but evidently that hasn't stuck enough either. So now they're trying this. That this sports issue has been spun up from nothing (trans women/girls could and did play competitive women's sports for decades before it ""suddenly"" became a problem) doesn't mean there's no reason to evaluate how trans women, with or without having gone through their default puberty, perform compared to cis women, but for anything meaningful to ever come from such discussions and/or research, trans women first have to stop being scapegoated as they are, because until then, it'll mostly be done in bad faith.   And even *then*, to have good justification to ban trans women/girls from competing with women, we'd need to show that there's an advantage that's significant enough to overcome the existing inherent unfairness in sports. There's this notion that women's sports must be safe and fair that oftentimes people don't apply to men's sports, and in these debates people almost always overlook the already existing advantages that athletes have against each other. I'm not just talking about biological advantages between cis men/women, because there's also other factors that people ignore entirely, such as socioeconomic status (evidence suggests that this difference is a huge factor that's more consistently impactful than biological differences). In discussions where the goal posts have moved past ""trans women = men = cheating/unfair,"" it still ends up unresolved while people argue whether there's an advantage at all. But elite sports are inherently unfair--we've collectively decided to accept this fact for men but aren't willing to admit that the same has always been true for women, too. So, it's less a question of whether there's an advantage at all rather than if the advantage is consistent and significant enough above and beyond the ""inherent unfairness that we've decided to accept/ignore."" What little evidence we have, both from literal performance rankings over the last 20+ years and some exploratory research, doesn't even come close to suggesting that such a unilateral advantage exists.   And I don't think we'll get to find out, what, because politicians have already made the decision with vibes-based justification (or just outright hateful bigotry/fearmongering). Because it's not about safety or fairness and it never was. I'm not sold that conservatives, who have been traditionally anti-science, definitely not pro-women, and who have a horrifying ""safety and fairness"" track record with both women and children, suddenly clearly see the truth and have the right of it on this issue. Arguing about fairness in sports, something that's never been meaningfully true anyway, is completely immaterial to the discussion by now.

"I would challenge you to think of any sport in which the open league that would not be, in effect, a men’s league.  Edit: by men’s league I mean males’ league, to be as precise as I can here",absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-08T13:23:39,2

"It's so easy for people that have no stake and nothing to lose to be so academic about these things. There's nothing wrong with refusing to answer a question that doesn't matter, because the core reason for the panic is artificial in the first place.

"I think it is quite logical to imagine an open league that isn’t all men? I know many people who have played on recreational co-ed soccer or flag football teams. An open league would be for men, women, and anyone else who either don’t want the commitment and competitiveness of the gendered teams or were not good enough to be accepted onto those teams.",lionhearted318,2025-05-08T13:36:13,0
does title IX codify based on biological sex or some other interpretation of the term? where is the legal definition of sex?,americend,2025-05-09T14:56:56,1
"Sorry, I should’ve specified that I pose this thought exercise WRT actual competitive sports leagues where winning offers a tangible reward: scholarships, money, endorsements, etc. And then subsequently what the sex makeup of the winning competitive players would be.  I do not mean a co-ed kickball beer league or darts night where you’re at best vying for a $50 bar tab haha",absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-08T14:08:42,2
Title IX is based on biological sex. Title IX acknowledges only two sexes exist.  Sex is by definition biological. True or false?,absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-09T15:11:50,2

It says “both sexes” multiple times.  Are those both biological sexes or both non-biological sexes?,absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-09T15:24:59,2
"Who knows, as the definition of sex is never laid out anywhere legally. But what it highlights is that the notion of sex precedes a biological determination. I can't tell you what the definition of sex is because it obviously varies across time and space. In this way it is very similar to race. Of course, you could try to ground sex in biology, as people try to do with race. I'm largely uninterested in that project, but good luck with it.",americend,2025-05-09T15:30:46,1
What is sex and how many human sexes are there?,absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-09T15:37:07,1
"What is sex in biology? You said something about gametes earlier. What is sex when people discriminate based on it in everyday life? Has absolutely nothing to do with the cells someone produces, because you cannot in general tell what sex cells someone produces by looking at them.   Interestingly, this is probably also why title IX does not require some kind of genetic screening to determine your sex before becoming operative. Lmfao.",americend,2025-05-09T15:48:11,1
"You can absolutely tell human sex at a glance, even infants can do it. It’s a natural human instinct. Humans are a sexually dimorphic species (two sexes with different secondary sexual characteristics that are trivial to tell apart)  What do you think Title IX means by “sex?” Vibes? If so, why did they only acknowledge two vibes?",absolutefunkbucket,2025-05-09T15:52:39,2
