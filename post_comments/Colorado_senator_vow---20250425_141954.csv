"There is no reason to kill a bill such as this. Absolutely none. Hell, even the now dead pope supported the idea for his own church to be held accountable.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T14:28:31,60
"Republican voters/politicians have proven time and again they don’t stand for anything. They’re just evil and stupid. Yes, I’m making a partisan attack because it’s about fucking time we call them out for the racist, misogynistic, anti-intellectual, child endangering moronic scum that they are. They just use children, veterans, farmers, etc. as props while doing everything they can to hurt them.",JohnnySack45,2025-04-25T14:45:09,31
The only reason they could possibly be against this is because they fear if the measure were to be passed half of their team would be bankrupted.,crazybones,2025-04-25T14:22:42,33
"She's a Colorado state senator, and ""go to ballot"" means: ""she will launch a signature gathering campaign to put a constitutional amendment before voters after Senate Republicans refused to refer the measure to the ballot.""",aleph32,2025-04-25T14:56:19,12
"Literally taking away resources so victims have to give birth.   ""Protecting women.""",Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-04-25T14:37:50,11
"""The amendment would allow child sexual abuse survivors to bring civil claims against their abusers and the institutions that cover up the abuse, no matter how long ago it happened.""   They literally needed only one republican stand up and vote to pass it. None of them did.",The_Starving_Autist,2025-04-25T17:16:51,8
Republicans are groomers.,squash_spirit,2025-04-25T20:09:39,5
Because naturally Republicans want to protect the institutions that allow them to abuse people they see as inferior with impunity.,LordSiravant,2025-04-25T19:33:27,2
"The survivors of child sexual abuse should stop bitching. If not for Republicans, there would barely be any survivors of child sexual abuse.",lee_bow,2025-04-25T14:25:58,4
Republicans don’t want to help survivors of child sexual abuse because they are the ones most prominently abusing children,Calm-Spray-9749,2025-04-25T21:48:27,1

"It's like Republicans enjoy diddling kids or something.   \*looks up some facts  Oh, it does appear the majority of kid diddlers are Republicans. Not surprised at all.",DarthHiccups,2025-04-27T17:46:54,1
"This is just the GOP doing what they can to protect the organizations that perpetrate mass sexual abuse of children and then work to help cover it up: this is about the GOP protecting churches, as most of their constituents attend those.",WildYams,2025-04-25T18:07:34,16

I’ll challenge you there… If you are a group of sick pieces of shit who can’t see past your own egos and hubris and deep deep narcissism… There’s tons of reason to stop a bill like this,maybetryyourownanus,2025-04-26T09:48:33,3
"Call it what it is, we won't fault you. Their favorite thing to do is prey on the vulnerable and what they consider weak. They love children but only bc they love to fiddle the children. With a crooked system they create they can continue to get away with it it, too. ",HermelindaLinda,2025-04-25T15:53:07,14
"They stand for lots of things!   All of them evil and despicable, but they are still things",NickelBackwash,2025-04-25T20:58:22,1
"Well....yeah. It's legal to marry a child with the parent's permission in over 30 states. You wanna guess how many of them are red? From backing the church to ending no fault divorce, the GOP absolutely fully backs sex criminals and pretty much always has. Hell, there are *pages* of registered sex offenders in their ranks. It's why they scream about ""the children"" so much; it's all projection.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-25T16:42:37,11
"This week, Republicans seem to be killing everything that helps crime victims in general.   The Department of Justice has cut grants that help fight human trafficking, programs to help curb juvenile delinquency and programs for reporting hate crimes. I think the goal is just plain cruelty.",ThisOneFuqs,2025-04-25T14:47:24,14
This is also the only possible reason for being against sex education.,Proud3GenAthst,2025-04-25T14:34:44,12
