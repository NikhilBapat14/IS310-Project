I guess it’s easier to go after 2 year olds versus gang members. ICE are so brave.,Sad-Demand6732,2025-04-26T05:27:28,27

"A US citizen doesn't get deported, there's nowhere to deport them to...   Actual headline should read: 2-Year Old U.S. Citizen Disappeared By Fascist Government.",Dirk_NoChillzki,2025-04-26T10:22:41,4
I just fucking can't with this admin.   At this point they're daring the courts to do something-- can we just call this a constitutional crisis yet?    A goddamn 2 year old. Way to radicalise people ya dumb bastard.,ClusterFoxtrot,2025-04-26T02:38:17,9
"Wondered what the test case would be for deporting a citizen.  This is how it starts.  Like toddlers, they will continue to push the boundaries and then throw tantrums when called out.  How many constitutional crises was that this week?",Oi_cnc,2025-04-26T02:34:21,4
Kind of impressive that a kid managed to become a capo in Tren de Aragua before they even knew their ABCs.,Violet-Journey,2025-04-26T08:07:42,2

These aren't mistakes.  Trump administration didn't take down Harriet Turman by accident.  Trump didn't disappear Kilmore on accident.  Nothing is being done by mistake.  They are testing the water so they can start deporting millions to concentration camps.  This is really starting to look like the actual Hitler play blook.  They are going to start deporting citizens on the same scale as illegal immigrants.  ,Crazy-Boysenberry452,2025-04-26T06:42:41,2

It was an administrative error. But also she is an illegal immigrant criminal gang-banger murder RAPIST and WILL NOT be coming back. And any far left lunatic rogue judge communist that disagrees will be ARRESTED and EXECUTED on the spot for AIDING AND ABETTING a criminal!,digoryj,2025-04-26T06:12:18,17
"Thats what happen when the admin put a quota on the arrest. So eventually they will leave out the dangerous guy, and do everything to push the number up. They are asking for 1500 arrests per day, which is 75 per ICE office a day, and normally they can only get to\~700 a day. The ICE top management has been a revolving door, and the pressure from all the way to the top is high. Homan is like all over the ICE agents every single day. Trump is super upset because with this speed, it will never reach 1 million for his first year, might not even be 2 millions for his entire term.  So for a very long time, we will be seeing ICE chasing for children because those are the easy shot.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-26T07:19:51,6

"For all of those feeling despair and helpless.  Know and remember that this and the myriad  of heart  wrenching, fist pounding, blatantly corrupt acts are the strategy. To overwhelm you as reasonable citizen into despair and helplessness. If you do one small thing to stick your finger the eye of these wretched acts this administration and fight back. Find strength in calling your senator or governor and tell them you will remember and they must stand against this administration.  Support your friends and community you’re stronger than you think and we’re stronger together.",Zurrilla13,2025-04-26T09:38:18,2

I’m with you - it’s exhausting. The only thing really helping me right now is just being really pissed off all the time. Idk it’s not healthy. I just don’t know what to do with the anger. These people are just being so mean my brain can’t comprehend it.,RubArtistic4683,2025-04-26T01:55:06,6
