"He’s not going to ignore it, he’s going to produce propaganda. He’ll rehire other “scientists” and create a report “debunking” climate change. They already did this with their Covid FAQ sheet online so why not do the same here?",Crazy_Employ8617,2025-04-30T16:56:14,5
"When we talk of the damages of climate change there are some people who truly fear it and some who don't care or choose to remain ignorant. Then, there are also some who hear it and want it, and actively encourage it because they will be poised to profit from the damages while also enjoying the prospects of watching the wars over food and safe water.",TheGreatHornedRat,2025-04-30T15:39:58,2
