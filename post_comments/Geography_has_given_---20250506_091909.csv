"Trump is trying to invent threats so that he then use those threats to justify authoritarian measures in the US in order to defend the nation from those threats.  His strategy has been simple but consistent: Turn everything into an emergency, as emergencies provide loopholes for executive action without restraint.  Of course, this is largely what Herr Hitler did, burning the Reichstag parliamentary building while blaming others for it in order to create an emergency.  That faux crisis was used to justify the Enabling Act, which gave him full control.  The difference here is that Trump isn't bothering with a vote from the legislature, but just counting on the Congress to do nothing while he uses executive orders.  So *Trump wants Canada to be an enemy*.  He has chosen Canada *because* it shares a border with the US. If there are no problems with our neighbors, then there is one less justification for his tangerine police state.",I405CA,2025-05-06T09:26:08,11
"Beginning of the article:  >The secret to American power and pre-eminence was best summed up more than a century ago.  >America, observed Jean Jules Jusserand, France’s ambassador to the United States during the first world war, “is blessed among the nations”. To the north and south were friendly and militarily weak neighbors; “on the east, fish, and the west, fish”. The United States was and is both a continental power and, in strategic terms, an island – with all the security those gifts of geography provide. No world power has ever been as fortunate. This unique physical security is the real American exceptionalism.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-06T09:19:47,4
