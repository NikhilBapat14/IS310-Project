"Absolutely impressive demonstration of life under dictatorship. Like some politburo, no republican dares to say a word for fear of reprisal from orange Stalin",pastoreyes,2025-05-08T01:43:01,305
"Yes, I want the whole country to see the enablers that UPHOLD the UNCONSTITUTIONAL POLICIES of this REGIME. When it comes time, THEY need to pay the price for their dereliction to the CONSTITUTION of the United States of America.",Puzzleheaded_Two6805,2025-05-08T03:58:34,151
More of that hearing from Joe Neguse (D-CO). Worth watching him continue to challenge the GOP. This is the Natural Resources Committee  https://youtu.be/UzAkdMoWmwc?si=Asq_g873yCb3d0uk,undercurrents,2025-05-08T00:08:47,135

"Said this on another thread.  Staying silent will not be enough for Trump. He *will* go for them. Like Hitler did, whether or not they're good little girls n boys.  This is not only cowardice and complicity, it's public acknowledgement they've given UP- for all of us, too.  Small comfort eventually those piggy little eyes will turn their way.",Mor_Padraig,2025-05-08T05:25:02,68

"We cannot give immunity to this government, if we survive this.    When I say no immunity...    ""He made me do it"" - Nope ""He lied to me"" - Nope ""I felt my life was in dangerous"" - Nope",Lebarican22,2025-05-08T06:31:07,52

"Why don’t these republicans just change their allegiance?  Senator Arlen Specter certainly did in April 2009.  The truth is these “republicans” are thinking they’ll be spared if they just give into 47’s demands.    They all had a chance to demonstrate their position to support and provide for the American people; no rhetoric on a podium is ever going to sway voters for the lot of them to stay on and if this nation allows them to stay, God help us all as we will be receiving what we voted for.    No one is coming to save you; we save ourselves or there will no longer be a country of free peoples.",MessMysterious6500,2025-05-08T06:07:32,22

"When he is gone I can virtually guarantee you that 90% of those people are going to do a 180 and condemn him.  They'd do it now but their political careers depend on him.  Exact thing happened with Stalin, (and before you tell me that's not a fair comparison, Tr\*mp would be doing the same thing if he could get away with it but you can't just make 10 million people vanish in 2025) when Stalin died.  Everyone depended on him for their lives and the second he was gone, they came out and said how they really felt about him.",tinyE1138,2025-05-08T07:06:13,23
This shit works for them though. Most people aren’t paying attention and their best bet is just to do their dirty work in silence. It’s sinister.,SoftwareHot,2025-05-08T05:52:12,18
The whole concept of three equal branches of government seems to be lost with the Republicans.  How low will Trump’s approval rating have to fall before they do anything,HippieJed,2025-05-08T05:34:30,14
Rich people scared of losing their job.  They'd rather destroy the planet than retire comfortably.,Sil-Seht,2025-05-08T07:11:37,14

"Thanks for sharing. He actually is my rep and I'm glad to see him make these stands.

"When we finally get to the other side of this we are going to need to put into law a lot of the “norms and customs” that the Founding Fathers assumed would protect the Republic. We’ll need to restructure the government to truly protect the agencies that congress fully intended to be independent. We will need to restructure the law around corruption and graft to have stronger enforcement and insulation from political influence.   The history of the US is two steps forward, one step back. Over the last 100 years we’ve made HUGE strides in the two steps forward. We’re now in the one step back phase. I believe this time is setting us up for the next two steps forward and those steps forward are going to be really amazing. I see more equality, more regulation against corruption, more financial equality, more reality and science based decision making on climate, medicine, etc… The forces in society are moving toward justice. I think we can do this. We can work toward a better future for our kids and grand kids.",Dedpoolpicachew,2025-05-08T10:17:22,20

"I think most of them just want this to be their career and the perks with that and worry most about losing their position either because they fear their local voting base is already too pro-Trump or that Trump himself would single them out for going against whatever he wants. They are not in it based on believing in democracy, justice, etc. above all. They rather just do what's most likely to result in them not losing their seats. Many likely live in areas that are comfortably or solidly Republican favoring so switching to the Democratic Party would result in them losing.",proudbakunkinman,2025-05-08T10:31:36,7

Bingo. Until white dudes on the right get mad nothing will change. Boycotting might work by tightening some screws at the top but it’ll need to be long term and widely adopted. Looks like target is working tho,DeliaDeLyon,2025-05-08T14:30:27,7
