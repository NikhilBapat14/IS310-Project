"There are some historical comparisons to be made to groups like Weather Underground, Black Panthers, etc., but, in the current day, [it is the hard-right that holds a monopoly](https://www.axios.com/2023/02/23/mass-killings-extremism-adl-report-2022) over organised political violence and politically-motivated terrorism.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-02-28T04:56:55,14
There really isn't a good left wing analogue to these movements because the core idea of these movements is somewhat antithetical to the majority of leftist politics.  QAnon is a quasi-religious nationalist movement that synthesizes a bunch of different conspiracy theories together in a big tent coalition.   That doesn't really exist anywhere on the left even if you blur the lines. Nationalism isn't a big draw for the left and the religious extremism of QAnon also doesn't have much truck with the left. There's definitely elements of conspiracism on the left but it's not as focused as QAnon tends to be. Though it's worth noting that QAnon does have a contingent of adherents that are vaguely lefty.  MAGA is just straight our hyper nationalism with some religiosity sprinkled over it. That really doesn't have a leftist parallel.  I mean....*maybe* tankies? That's probably as close as you could realistically get to that kind of blind hyper nationalism.  Patriot Front is a neo-nazi hate group soooo....probably not going to find much of that on the left.,HeloRising,2023-02-28T01:47:33,9
"The closest thing are probably ""tankies,"" which is a generic catch-all group for Leftists that support and deny crimes by the USSR and other former soviet states.  They are however infamously divided to [parody](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/864/134/f82.jpg) and are far smaller in numbers.  The general political climate, both domestically and internationally, has greatly favored the radical right more than the radical left, contributing to the imbalance.  There are also some black power groups, however really only the New Black Panther Party and numerous Black Hebrew groups seem to be really active extremist groups and it be considered a stretch to consider them left-wing though you might see a couple of those types at leftist rallys and meetings.  EDIT:  Oh, there is also the LaRouche Movement, which sorta grew out of leftist radical movements in the 1970s and occasionally appropriates leftist language but sorta evolved into its own weird ideology that somehow alienated itself from nearly every other political fringe movement on both sides.  More of a weird cult than a political movement thought.",Naliamegod,2023-02-28T08:08:41,2
"Sophie From Mars did a fantastic video essay on [Left-Wing Conspiracy Theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZyIjBxxpTY) a while ago. I highly recommended it   They are nowhere near as influential as the Q-ANON etc, but you have people leek Caleb Maupin and Peter Coffin, who consider themselves communists, stan for Russia and China, and pretty much believe CIA is behind everyone who subtweets something rude to them.   Outside of the Anglo-American world, you might find more parallels. Certainly, the Chavista government in Venezuela (and to a much lesser extent their allies in Bolivia and the recently removed government of Peru) have become increasingly conspiratorial in their rhetoric, the difference is of course that the CIA really is out to get them, but they still seem to see the CIA and ""imperialists"" more broadly around every corner. The pro-Russian Left that exists in Eastern Europe also resembles these tendencies.",loselyconscious,2023-03-03T04:02:26,2
"The various Antifa groups are similar to Patriot Front in nature. The 'Cop City' domestic terrorism arrests would be another example.  MAGA isn't really a 'movement' so much as a Trump fan club. Bernie Sanders supporters could be considered a left wing version.  However, I suspect you're not recognizing the left wing variants for the same reason the fish doesn't recognize the water: you're acclimated to left-leaning extremism in a way you're not acclimated to right-leaning extremism. So a lot of objectively extreme beliefs/behaviors just seem normal to you because they're coming from one end of the political spectrum rather than the other.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-28T04:20:18,-2
"You are asking **three** different questions.  MAGA is the cult of personality built around former president Donald Trump.  QAnon is a family of internet-based conspiracy theories that is used by politicians on the right (e.g. Marjorie Taylor Green) to build support for their candidacies but is really its own self-sustaining thing.  Patriot Front is a white supremacist organization.  MAGA  There are popular figures on the left like Bernie Sanders and AOC but none command the cult-like devotion of Donald Trump. I cannot name a single figure on the American left who is asking for what Trump demands from his followers. Sanders lost in two attempts to gain the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party but did not engage in election denialism nor did he ask his supporters to violently respond to his losses.  QAnon  There are conspiracy theories on the left but there isn't a theory of everything (TOE) that QAnon supporters believe they've found with its lunacy about a cabal of Satanic pedophiles who run the deep state.  Patriot Front  Racial supremacy is anathema to left-wing politics, so there would be no parallel here.",[deleted],2023-03-14T13:02:33,1

"The LaRouche Movement started out as a quirky offshoot of Trotskyism in SDS in the late 60s but then really ended up on the far right. But even then it's weird like you said, like a gnostic cult based around Weird Science, esoteric philosophy and a Whiggish love for big infrastructure projects They've tried to rebrand themselves as left, but it's one particular faction within the movement that split after Lyndon LaRouche died a few years ago, and led by his widow.  And by gnostic I mean ""inaccessible"" basically. Like the really weird stuff is inside. The movement is not usually what it says, but whatever mask they wear, and they're known for trying to infiltrate every conceivable group across the political spectrum. Like, they try to synchronize themselves with whoever they're masking as, but there's always some kinda duplicitous trick involved that takes some time to play out.  I'd add that LaRouche was a really vile person. They also really like war and at least historically could be physically dangerous.",DukeSnookums,2023-03-01T22:27:23,4
I’m curious how you came to relate the two.   Which Antifa groups specifically?   Which churches have antifa aligned groups attacked (as analogous to proudboys attacking libraries)? Which unarmed peaceful demonstrators were killed when a member of which antifa aligned group hit them with their car?  Many republicans seem to think of MAGA as more than a trump fan club  - there’s a whole house freedom caucus and Desantis is actively working to separate MAGA from trump.   I suspect that you may want to take some of your own advice.,ApolloDeletedMyAcc,2023-02-28T21:30:21,10
"Ehhh no.  Antifa itself is a social movement. There are some groups that use the name but there's no governing or organizing body that they report to. Nobody enforces an ""antifa copyright.""  Patriot Front is an actual, specific group of people who have distinctive members and relationship networks. It's something you actively join and there is (loose) coordination among chapters with specific founding members in leadership roles.  >MAGA isn't really a 'movement' so much as a Trump fan club.  This is just wild. Pretty much all of the luminary figures within that sphere have explicitly stated that MAGA is a movement. Some of it does focus on Trump but increasingly it's growing out of that space into a more broadly hyper-conservative/authoritarian political movement that's independent of a single person.  >However, I suspect you're not recognizing the left wing variants for the same reason the fish doesn't recognize the water: you're acclimated to left-leaning extremism in a way you're not acclimated to right-leaning extremism. So a lot of objectively extreme beliefs/behaviors just seem normal to you because they're coming from one end of the political spectrum rather than the other.

"Can you support the claim that we are acclimated to ""objectively"" extreme leftist behaviors and beliefs with data? Because this is directly contradictory what currently known data trends show, and the certainty with which you declare objectivity without providing data is a bit of a red flag.",[deleted],2023-03-04T17:28:13,2
Yeah whoever those people are that they arrested in Georgia would be the left-wing equivalent. But I have no idea who organized those people or how. You could almost believe that they were recruited by somebody wanting to draw attention away from the Proud Boys etc.,TheLeftHandedCatcher,2023-03-07T22:03:41,2

"The overwhelming majority of educators and media figures are significantly to the left of center. Reddit itself is significantly left of center.  This means that unless you are very careful, you are swimming in a sea of left-of-center opinion.

I’d take some time to assess the comment. It doesn’t really hold up to scrutiny.   I’d challenge the poster to find elected democrats making anywhere near the statements made by those on the other side of the aisle.,ApolloDeletedMyAcc,2023-02-28T21:34:55,8
"So I’ve got some questions on your claims.   You say that the “overwhelming majority of educators and media figures” are “significantly” to the left.   These are quantitative claims. Can you provide some data?   You say that you suspect I’m using faulty statistics, and that’s entirely plausible. I’m a non-traditional Political Science / Stats major,  finally finishing my degree after a decade of being in a different career. I am by no means an expert but I do have a basic understanding of statistical methods and research design. I’d like to think that I could spot bad stats by now.   Can you show me yours? Also, what method are you using to measure how far left a given person is?",[deleted],2023-03-04T17:43:17,2
I'd like to inform you about a site called 'Wikipedia' that answers these sorts of general knowledge questions.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_views_of_American_academics  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias_in_the_United_States,ViskerRatio,2023-03-04T18:05:02,0
"I'm not going to lie man, this answer kind of feels like a cop out. Wikipedia's problems as a source aside, the page on political views of academics clearly says that while there is a *recent* general lean towards democrats in party ID, the methodology of those studies used to identify political bias is contested, and interpretations are unclear. On top of that, you've shifted the goalposts from educators to university professors, which are only one kind of educator and also the one kind that the fewest members of the public are exposed to.  So not only did you not provide any statistics, not disclose how you're measuring political lean or what you're counting as extreme vs not extreme, you've falsely correlated partisan ID to magnitude of political extremism also changed who you're talking about.  Your source for media bias is even worse, because while it does cite that there is a ""weak"" correlation between reading newspapers and having negative views about republican politicians (no mention of republican voters or policies), but it says that there is *definitive* news media bias against unions and workers, both left-wing bastions, and *overwhelming* right wing ""domination"" of social media platforms.  You claimed that the ""*overwhelming* majority of *educators* and *media figures* are  *significantly* to the left of center"".  You provided a reference to some evidence (not the evidence itself) that an undefined numerical majority of a minority subset of educators are registered to a center-left political party, with no indication of how far to the left any of them actually are, which came with a qualified admission that the methodology and interpretation of the evidence you referenced (not provided) is up for debate.  You then provided a reference to evidence that said that newspaper opinion pieces tend to favor a liberal view on a specific set of topics, mostly gays and guns, said that newspaper readers are *slightly* less likely to like republican politicians (with no accounting for reverse causation), found a definitive anti-left bias on unions and labor, and found total right wing domination of social media platforms (despite right wing imaginations to the contrary). The ONLY mention of media *figures*, the subject of your claim, was to say a plurality of the individuals who appeared on news broadcasts for interviews expressed right-of-center opinions on economics.  I'm really not sure why you said that the data I am aware of is bad statistics if this is what you have to rely on. I am also wondering what exactly you think extreme left views actually are, and where you think ""center"" is.",[deleted],2023-03-04T19:15:13,1
