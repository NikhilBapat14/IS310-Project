"This will never happen.  All of the US GOP and even Trump's MAGA supporters know that if Canada became the 51st state, it would reverse-takeover the US political system.  Not even his strongest supporters will go along with this.  It would be like adding a second California to the US - a 40million population state (larger than CA and TX) that is more liberal than all other US states, and which has national healthcare and a bunch of other things liberals love and US conservatives hate.  Canada would add something like 50+ members to the US House of Representatives, ensuring the US Republican Party (GOP) never controlled the House ever again.  It would add a similar number of Electoral Votes, ensuring the US Republican Party never won the Presidency again.  Canada's reps would side with the US Democratic Party and liberals to pass National Healthcare in the US and all sorts of other things the GOP hates, and the GOP would be powerless stop it.  They would become a permanent minority party.  Canada is completely safe from this ever happening, no matter what Trump blithers on about.  His own party knows the implications, and will fight against him on this one.",SkyMarshal,2025-04-28T12:15:03,7

Would that not just cause an entirely different reaction if we actually did start increasing our military?  Increasing the military also means gaining access to nuclear weapons.

"I think for now it is a political fantasy of his, to declare war with another country the president needs money (war is not cheap), the only way to get that money is to go before Congress and ask for it. He would have to sell Congress on the need for the war and Congress would have to vote to approve a budget for the war otherwise trump has no money to pay for any of it (soldiers like eating, being paid, and having ammunition to fight with).  George Bush Jr. had to go through this song and dance to start his ""War on Terror"", in the post 9/11 environment. Congress was more agreeable someone had to be made to answer for the twin tower attack, right now selling Americans on war with Canada would be very difficult, we do not feel threatened by Canada (this is a good thing as it robs Trump of any large source of pro war propaganda value).  Now if a Canadian were to do something horrible in the name of Canadian Independence then that would be very bad and could change the political calculus.

Canada believes in sovereignty and integrity (much of our underground assets are on indigenous lands protected by treaties).  Trump targeting Canada the way he has is meant to break us, and when the world rallied around us he said ""if they back Canada they're going to get hit tarrifs too"" and then he did that because support got stronger, not weaker.  His attacking everyone else is tactic to remove support from us because he's not kidding about breaking us and taking us over.  He's not done breaking things.

It's the same populist rhetoric, the same three word slogans, the same vague boogeyman elite keeping the little guy down, the same railing against our institutions and the same rhetoric about how the other party is responsible for every single grievance people happen to have.  The ONLY reason pp is speaking out (very weakly) against Trump was because the conservatives seen a historic seat count vaporize to the point where they're playing catch up now. If he was really against Trump he would have came out against him right away instead of blaming the liberals and taking two weeks to figure out what to do when every other politician immediately spoke out against it.   If he as crazy as trump is in his current term? No, but it never starts out like that. Even trump wasn't as unhinged in his first term as he is this time. Pp is seen by the majority of the population as opening the door to that kind of Americanized politics to take hold in the future. Something like 30 percent of conservative voters favour what Trump is doing. It's not a small portion.   He's made token statements against Trump (around the same time Trump coincidentally put the 51st state crap on hold) but he's still blaming the liberals for it. Flying 51st state flags would be a sure way to destroy support for them, why would they do that?   Before trump won they weren't even hiding it.

"That's such a ridiculous statement.  ""America"" isn't ONE GIANT HIVE MIND. ""Oh look, misogyny doesn't exist because AMERICA put a WOMAN on the ballot!"" Every bit as ridiculous and disingenuous as saying ""Racism doesn't exist anymore because OBAMA WAS ELECTED"".   Now all we need to do is put someone POOR on the ballot to solve POVERTY too!",Old-Set78,2025-04-28T10:33:55,5
"Because the Democrat party isn't sexist, duh. Did you even think that question through?",Hyperactiv3Sloth,2025-04-28T10:55:29,2
I have no idea what you mean?  Most women will tell you they know at least one man who admitted that they can't vote for a woman.  Was Joe Biden a stronger candidate?  He beat a sitting president.,Greybirdk22,2025-04-28T10:45:14,5
"You do realize if covid hadn't happened trump would have won 2020 right? Biden was Obama VP, Obama remains incredibly popular and people wanted that from biden. You cannot compare that at all.",FartPudding,2025-04-28T10:46:32,1
Lots of speculation on your part. Trumps policies were just starting to kick in when Covid hit. If anything they camouflaged the damage they were starting to do.,OttoOtter,2025-04-28T10:49:31,3
"That's all speculation.  I think if the pandemic had not happened, Trump would have been just as harmful to the economy then as now.  Also only my guess, based on 21st century Republican presidents strangling the good economies left to them by Democrats.",Greybirdk22,2025-04-28T11:00:11,2
