"Oh wow, so all of this is his idea?? Thanks a lot, Matt Gaetz! It's originally your fault that innocent people have been sent by the US into a foreign concentration camp.  >“The conditions had zapped the inhabitants of any will to fight,” Gaetz told *TIME*. “It’s tough to see the state of the human condition drained of hope.”  >Gaetz then pitched the idea of sending migrants to the mega-prison to immigration hardliner Miller, a source told the outlet, who then presented it to Trump.  So he saw that and thought ""That's a great idea!"" Sick.",sachiprecious,2025-04-25T16:34:25,55

Good on him for sharing his involvement. Human rights prosecutors will need it in future in Nuremberg 2.,Waste-Gene-7793,2025-04-25T20:45:40,6
"How is this not a case of offshoring jobs? Are the guards US citizens? Was the prison US built? Are the prison supplies US sourced? So, America first?",pokey68,2025-04-25T18:48:15,6
The fact that they didn't keep him kind of proves the facility isn't really intended to hold criminals.,Interesting_Play_578,2025-04-25T19:16:42,7

"The fact that these degenerate, soulless fucks exist in wealth, luxury and entitlement suggests to me that there is no karma in the universe   Cosmic order must be established by force",The_300_goats,2025-04-26T02:21:55,6

Both of them should be in prison.,Troubled202,2025-04-25T22:30:06,3
No wonder Trump tried so hard to push him through despite the litany of republicans begging him not to.,vonnecute,2025-04-25T23:05:59,2

"Every time I get jump scared by his hideous face, I'm reminded of the purposely ugly rubber puppets from ""Spitting Image"".   He looks like one of the discarded ones who were left forgotten in a hot attic for too long.",NihilisticPollyanna,2025-04-27T18:38:30,2
I think juvenile sexual abuser is more accurate. But gimp of gnome works,beadzy,2025-04-25T18:32:06,18

"Because it’s kind of the opposite. Offshoring jobs means a different person somewhere else does the same job. This is the same person going somewhere else to do a different job. Human trafficking is the technical term. In all likelihood, these people are being sold as slaves for cash.",ThrowRA76234,2025-04-25T22:19:08,3

"If only there were some way to force them to regret it. Like right now   I mean they can never be made to think ""I must change my wicked ways. I have been so heartless""  But they can certainly be made to think ""Damn. I am in some deep shit""",The_300_goats,2025-04-26T04:24:49,3
"I agree with what you’re saying. They will always be heartless but my guess is in four years, their careers will be destroyed and/or they’ll be indicted.",mcolette76,2025-04-26T15:21:01,1
