"Is this the one where they were totally cool deporting cancer kids that were US citizens? Couldn't get the sound to work due to my  service. If it is, it just shows how the right hate everyone and don't care what happens to our own citizens.",Embarrassed_Angle_59,2025-05-04T13:27:09,40

Did I miss that these scumbags are planning to deport American citizens just because they have cancer? Or was this just a thought question? Cuz this is friggin disgusting either way. So sad how they‚Äôd rather kiss the boot than have any humanity.,Bulldogs3144,2025-05-04T15:59:20,5

"CALL THEM AND DON'T STOP! We need to FORCE them to confront the fact that the vast majority of Americans are FURIOUS about this, and about their criminal complicity with this ILLEGITIMATE REGIME.   Their staff has to log every call. We need to keep the firehouse open on them until it blows them into the gutter where they belong.  Here is a link to the Phone List for OUR U.S. Senators. Print it, share it, and USE IT DAILY.  THESE PEOPLE WORK FOR US- NOT TRUMP.

"Pointing out that they're assholes doesn't do anything because they don't feel shame.  Pointing out that they're hypocrites doesn't do anything because they're proud of it.  Democrats need to wake the fuck up and realize that they're the only ones that still play by the ""rules"" and the game is unwinnable if it stays that way.  The system is dead and there's nothing that keeps these monsters in check because they are without fear.",RNW1215,2025-05-05T19:27:28,1
"Ok, but it was not the child, who is a citizen, that was being deported. The child's mother, who is not a citizen, was the one being deported and was given the choice of she wanted to leave her child here in the states with someone she deemed safe, or take her child with her to her country if origin. So, the mother chose to take her child with her.",Arekage,2025-05-05T21:36:10,1

But but but the evil democrats with tds didn't clap when they used a child with cancer to show what a great president Trump is. Like so great they're cutting cancer research funds.   Not standing and clapping is way worse than saying they wouldn't oppose deporting a child with cancer who is a US citizen  /s .,Bookshelfhelp,2025-05-05T07:06:12,1

"reports indicate that a 4-year-old U.S. citizen with cancer was deported to Honduras with his mother after she was arrested, reports from the ACLU and other organizations stated. The child was deported despite his cancer treatment and without his necessary medication, according to civil rights groups. The mother was also deported, and a second child, a 7-year-old, was also deported to Honduras.   He was also deported without his medication. The doctors and mother pleaded with ICE to let the child stay until the child was healed and ICE refused. Stating they have orders. So no, the mother didn't agree to take the child with her.",Exotic_Active2744,2025-05-06T08:43:58,1
