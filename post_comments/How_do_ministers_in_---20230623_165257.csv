"To some degree, American politicians do 'stack' jobs, just maybe not exactly the same way.   But to the core of the question, usually they get extra staff that help manage it. Similarly, while they don't become the Head of Government with it, US members of Congress actually do have leadership responsibilities that often gives them much larger responsibilities (including on committees as you've flagged) and in party leadership roles. And to serve those, they get additional staff and often effectively additional offices worth of staff.   So for example, Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House has more staff than, for example, a junior Congressman with no significant leadership positions. And that staff is there to support his role both as Speaker of the House, and as Representative for CA-20.   Some would similarly argue that that kind of role distracts from a lot of their district based priorities - and in particular constituent services. Realistically - that's probably true to some extent but it's also true that the MP or the Congressman's role in most constituent services is managed by staff anyway. What is true is that their focus has to increasingly become national as their portfolio and public position demands.   That being said, the reverse is also true in that most constituents actually see value in having their representative be in a position of additional power - and some could argue then that their priorities take an even higher priority rather than lower.",PhiloPhocion,2023-06-27T06:53:10,3
