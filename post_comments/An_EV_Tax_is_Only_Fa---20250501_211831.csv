How about no tax? Stop spending so much and you won’t have to tax everyone to death. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T05:32:45,11
"I live in CA, because of the gas tax, any person with a relatively benign commute is paying thousands over the national average a year. All of these ""fees"" in the name of maintain roads... Which in the years the gas tax has been going in my county, I have only seen a couple get maintained. One of which was so bad, that it likely damaged vehicles while being only about 2miles long. Another one of these ""fixes"" was to a bridge, to ""to update crash ratings, and provide better foot and bicycle movement"" Safety, okay, sure... foot traffic, okay there is a river... Bicycle support!!! the bridge is at the bottom of two steep ass hills.   Anyway, the TLDR is that these fees are nothing but a scam. And if we can not get rid of them, I am onboard for spreading the pain to EVs, and Bicycles.",thatfordboy429,2025-05-01T22:38:43,5
"Negative….we pay federal and state tax when we fill up at the pump to maintain the roads. EV’s are some of the heaviest vehicles out there which are not good for the roads and they need to be taxed a fraction of a penny per mile to when they register their vehicle each year. They pay the difference between last year’s odometer to this year’s. Furthermore, i would not be against them paying another fee to equip first responders the extinguishing agents for earth metal fires. Can’t use water on them",Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-02T07:41:45,-3
California is about the worse but MA is trying to compete. Excise Tax every year.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T03:58:02,2
What is conservative about you again? How big of a government do you want? Pretty sure trucks and not EVs destroy the roads. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T08:24:16,2
"Please look at my previous comments to see my conservatism. Ev vehicles are equivalent to the same weight as my Tundra and that’s a heavy piece of metal. Please enlighten me, how do you expect for the roads to be repaired when you have a percentage of the population circumventing it with their EV’s? I’m not for big government, but those taxes we pay at the pump do have purpose.",Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-02T08:35:48,-1
Trucks destroy the roads. Heavy trucks that transport containers. EVs do the same damage as a normal car. Educate yourself. ,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-05-02T11:05:02,5
"I appreciate the gaslighting, but if you have 30% of the general population driving heavier pedestrian vehicle to coincide with the trucking industry….your roads do not last as long. That’s also why heavier vehicles pay more in registration fees. Let’s play your game and go with zero fees for electrical. What’s going to offset fixing the roads with diminished revenue from the gas pump? Do you increase the gas tax? Do increase registration for trucking? Potholes suck, but i would prefer it not be national identity like the Slavic countries",Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-02T15:07:25,-1
