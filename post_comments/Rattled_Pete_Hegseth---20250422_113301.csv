"He was an infantry platoon leader for a bit so things started off typical. However, it appears he was tasked at the S-9 (Civil Affairs) which is an odd trajectory for an infantry officer and you can read into that what you will. Then it appears he volunteered to teach a class that senior NCOs typically teach in Kabul. Probably to get time in theater for veteran purposes. Then IRR(reserve). Then ARNG in DC. His career looks like one you see in a lot of officers who have disciplinary issues or just half-ass their way through everything because they like the way the uniform makes them feel.   He’s an infantry officer. But he didn’t complete any of the schools infantry officers normally do.  For a 20-year infantry officer in his generation, at minimum, I would expect airborne or air assault, and ranger school partnered with at least one company command.  He was barred from serving during Biden’s inauguration because he was deemed an “insider threat” because of his “Deus vult” tattoo. So there’s some bitterness probably.
