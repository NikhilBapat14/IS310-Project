"I mean you are right, but could you imagine having some of the best scientists in the world telling you what to do and still fucking it up? Like anyone in this thread could do RFK Jr's job better than him as long as they just shut the F up and did what the highly educated experts that are there to help them say to do.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T10:01:45,7
"The fact people say stuff like this with a smile and a grin like, ofc everyone knows it’s sarcasm but it’s gone on for so long with nobody ever calling him on his idiocy. It’s embarrassing for our entire government to be such a poorly put together reality show.",f1del1us,2025-04-25T12:33:38,2
