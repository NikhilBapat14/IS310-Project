"The ICC, as most courts, has zero power. Courts operate by delcaring or establishing law, but they don't have the power of the sword. Enforcement must be done by others. For international law, enforcement is done by States. \[1\]     But, the ICC has significant influence. 124 countries are parties to the Rome Statute. \[2\] Those States now have the legal obligation to arrest Netanyahu if he enters their jurisdiction. One Dutch MP has already said that if Netanyahu visited the Netherlands, he'd be arrested. Will they actually do it? We'll only find out if Netanyahu takes the risk and travels to one of those countries.  \[1\] [https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works)  \[2\] [https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties](https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties)",Sisyphuss5MinBreak,2024-11-21T14:10:42,6
"  The US, Israel, and Russia are all not state parties to the statute which binds a state to apprehend a person under an ICC warrant.   If either of those people were to enter territory controlled by any state on that list, then that party would be compelled to arrest them and transfer them to appear before the ICC.    The ICC will do its best to locate and maintain information about them.  They are also able to utilize non state entities to assist in capture and transport as they see fit.   How that would play out in reality given who these people are is anyone's guess.     https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties  https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/bookletArrestsENG.pdf",ricksanchez__,2024-11-21T15:14:29,3
