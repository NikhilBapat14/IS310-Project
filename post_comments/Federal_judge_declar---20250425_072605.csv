"> Federal judge declares   What do you guys think the over/under is for seeing this in headlines through 2028?   It's already been at least 50, right?",MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-25T07:37:52,150
"A federal judge in San Francisco blocked the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions, claiming doing so would be unconstitutional.  A judge in San Francisco huh?",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T08:05:07,134
How is giving federal money to Sanctuary Cities constitutionally legal?,uponone,2025-04-25T19:31:05,13
It's becoming a farce now. Seems the left believes Trump must consult a liberal district judge first before attempting any presidential action. What a joke.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-25T08:06:37,107
"My question is, where in the constitution is it written or implied that the Federal Government is required to fund a city?  The law of the land must be enforced therefore a sanctuary city is unconstitutional by law.  How can this be blocked by a court?  I don’t understand?",Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-25T09:44:04,22
"As always, they can’t block, only issue a temporary injunction for further legal review. As always, this will be overturned with legal review. As always, none of these orders are issued without extensive internal review by DOJ and others that they will pass the legal challenge process they know is coming on every order issued.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-25T08:24:10,24
I do not expect SCOTUS to do the right thing.  It's less of a let down if I just assume they won't.   I'm also really really disappointed in Congress for not passing some fucking laws already.,PastorofMuppets79,2025-04-25T13:23:41,7

"It’s time for President Trump to ignore these judges. The left is creating a constitutional crisis by stopping the President of the United States.

Can the courts give us all a list of things that Trump can do that they feel IS constitutional?,scully360,2025-04-25T11:12:36,3
Pretty sure Sanctuary Cities are UnConstitutional. You know all that harboring a fugitive and such.  I say start making Sanctuary Cities for the 2nd Amendment.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-25T11:31:03,4
"SCOTUS recently knocked down venue shopping for these injunctions, but since San Fran is the plaintiff, this judge technically has the jurisdiction under that ruling. It will have to be appealed of course.",LemartesIX,2025-04-25T11:45:24,1

My DM is get hit up with lefty explanations of why this is unconstitutional.  I have not read or heard one article that mentions what type of federal funds.  There are many.  A president has the legal right to (through executive agencies) influence how future grants are awarded by: 	•	Changing grant criteria (if the law gives the agency discretion). 	•	Delaying or slowing down approvals. 	•	Prioritizing or deprioritizing certain cities when awarding competitive grants. The sanctuary city by definition is illegal.,Longjumping-Note-117,2025-04-25T19:05:51,8

"They're doing it because so far they've been able to get away with it. I'm hoping next month SCOTUS narrows the scope of the district judges' authority, prompting them to either accept fewer cases or limiting them to the district in which they preside. Let the circuit court, after a *panel* reviews appeals decide whether or not an injunction should apply nationally, if it even has merit to begin with.   Edit: clarity",social_dinosaur,2025-04-25T09:17:16,28
What makes you think they are winning it back? They have nothing of value to offer. The Democrat party is shattered. All they have is profanity laced TikTok videos they overpaid social media consultants for.  Hell of a display of policy and money management.,uponone,2025-04-25T19:34:02,3
They are doing anything they can to stall everything in this administration.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-25T09:41:26,7
"Injunctions kind of have to apply nationally, because the alternative is that you have different laws in different places and basically chaos. If the law applies equally to everyone, then an injunction striking down a government action should apply to everybody.   The focus should be on whether or not the injunction is proper. Which, again, will unfortunately have to be appealed before Trump can get anything done.   We should have the same stance with the courts as we have with the police. The institution is a necessary one, and we should make sure we have good people running it, and at the same time we need to make sure the institution is able to function in its essential role. If we destroy its ability to do its job, society will only get worse",woailyx,2025-04-25T09:35:08,18
"Trump/Musk antics and trolling has done quite a bit of damage to the Republican side. You better believe that left leaning news sources are leaving out every last drop of bullshittery they're doing to mess with the administration and make it look like it's a complete and total failure, while propping up their own side.    There are a lot of flakey and dumb people in this country, it won't take much to push it back over the line. ""Trump has been in office for over a year and I still can't afford to own a home or buy groceries. Fuck this, I'm voting the other side again.""    Nevermind how much complex lawfare went behind the scenes to manufacture that problem.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-26T13:46:21,1

"That's why I believe district judges should determine if a case with national implications first has merit and should be pursued, and if so defer it to the higher court with a panel of judges, to decide whether or not to hear  it. That way all this judge shopping nonsense is mitigated and actually lends legitimacy to the process. Removing the authority of the lower judge to issue these injunctions would help to promote the image of fairness, which we do not have at all right now.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-25T10:39:21,1
"The way to achieve uniformity is for judges to follow appellate level precedents.   You can't have trial courts actively defer cases to appellate courts for a variety of reasons. It means appellate courts won't control their own dockets and will be overburdened with cases, it means appellate courts will have to hear full trials with evidence and witnesses, which makes them take even longer, and you no longer have injunctions available at first instance where they need to be available because litigants need quicker decisions.   So basically the point of even having all the district courts is to give people access to justice in the first place, and the circuits are mainly supposed to be there to reverse errors and impose uniformity when the district courts seem to be diverging.   None of this changes the fact that if a court has decided the government can't do something, then the government still can't do that thing (subject to appeal) even on the other side of the same country where the law is the same",woailyx,2025-04-25T12:18:52,5
