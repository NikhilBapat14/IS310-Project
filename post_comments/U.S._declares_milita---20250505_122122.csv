"Nice, we should do this in all major cities.  Despite all of America's foreign escapades over the past century, one of the main functions of our nation's (any nation's) military is still to defend its borders. This is fully under its purview.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T13:56:38,-2

100%. We need to keep our country SAFE and no radical left judge can stop that.,MMcDeer,2025-05-05T20:52:14,3
I mean I’m opposed to it on the fact Congress hasn’t done shit about it yet. President actions can be overturned by a new President or a new Congress . We need permanent long standing solutions that make sense.,Stained_Dagger,2025-05-05T17:58:07,17

"That is for the base they are getting mad, leadership and strategy has little to do with being mad. It has everything to do with how to replace the massive domestic immigration outflows from, blue cities, and states.  They know Florida and Texas is going to deport, not let vote, not give Drivers licenses etc while they do everything they can in blue zones to keep and attract foreign immigrants (legal and illegal) giving them transportation, hotels, medical coverage, medicaid, benefits etc",Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-05T14:33:10,-13

"Hopefully it can stay, because this strategy is pretty genius really.   It's not really necessary, not *now* at least, as crossings have plummeted.   Where this really pays off is the next Democrat administration, who always pretend they're not actually encouraging an open border.  That Democrat administration will be forced into the awkward position of having to shut down this base to re-open the border, while simultaneously claiming they're not re-opening the border.  Essentially, this forces the Democrats to expose the fact that they are in fact in favor of open borders.",CallMeCassandra,2025-05-05T18:20:59,3
"The only congressional action I want is to see congress tie the executives hands as much as possible into actually enforcing border security. That and legitimate immigration reform l, which is certainly needed for a number of reasons.",deadzip10,2025-05-06T07:24:41,0
Down votes my badge of courage for the blue zone population boosts needed to replace Americans leaving those areas … truth hurts liberal downvoters … feel free to google the millions of domestic migration away from blue states and cities 2014-2024 … only replaced by foreign immigrants …,Cultural_Ad4874,2025-05-06T10:32:04,0
