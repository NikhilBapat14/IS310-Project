How can anyone really think it's okay to be this hateful?  How is it considered okay for a political party to divide an entire country when their job is supposed to be to lead and work for everyone?,Serenity867,2025-04-22T14:50:05,94
It’s a wish fulfillment strategy: their voters feel victimized by not being able to say these things because they’re nobodies and they’d face consequences.  Their congressional reps using slurs openly is living the dream for them. The videos are transportive fantasies.  Pissed at all them LGBTLMNOPs? You can watch Nancy Mace scream the T-word repeatedly on a loop for 10 hours on YouTube.   It’s all just variations of Orwell’s “Two Minutes Hate” from *1984*.,Salt-Excuse8796,2025-04-22T16:06:55,35

"I live in her district and a few years ago I had the misfortune of being seated at a table next to her at a local restaurant at lunchtime.  She was dining with a pastor of what I assumed was her church and the two of them openly and loudly talked about issues he wanted her to push on the legislative level, all of which were ultra right wing, uber conservative, pseudo Christian issues.  He pretty much dictated to her what HE wanted her to do.  And she agreed to it all.  Do not ever assume that she represents any of her constituents - she represents white “Christian” patriarchal nationalism.  She’s corrupt, and we need rid of her.",2PieTimmy,2025-04-22T17:47:11,16

"Frankly, as a trans woman, I find it hard to get offended over being called a ""fairy.""  Like, you hear ""fairy,"" and your first thought definitely isn't ""evil criminal coming to cheat at children and steal your sports."" Seeing as that's the position of both major US parties on trans people, ""fairies"" almost feels like a win.  Calling her colleague ""boy"" is fucking gross though.",ALWETP,2025-04-22T21:08:41,4
"There should Not be a place in Society for people like her. Sadly there is, and she has supporters defending her. Everyone on them “identifies” as a Christian.

"Republicans/conservatives represent traditional culture, which is racist, homophobic, just generally bigoted. That's just how they talk, think and view the world - through a weirdo brainwashed white supremacist lens, with a straightforward white supremacist admin validating them (it's a coup, but still haha).",_the_king_of_pot_,2025-04-22T21:53:59,2
