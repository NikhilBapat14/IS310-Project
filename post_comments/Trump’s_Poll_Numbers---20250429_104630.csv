"About a third of our neighbors  are idiot, sociopathic sadists who are vicariously reveling in the pain and trauma Trump is inflicting on marginalized groups.     They will never abandon their bully god because they derive too much sadistic gratification from his Nazi horror show.   So that is the floor for Trump, the sociopathic third.   Where we go from here is increasing the intensity of contempt for Trump from the sane center. Right now about 44% strongly dislike the direction the country is headed in. This is where there is a lot of room for growth and where that growth will really matter.   A majority of Americans strongly opposed to Trump will break him by sharply undermining his support within the GOP.  And there is every reason to think that tariffs are about cause the kind of economic calamity that can galvanize the center against Trump.   But we can not sit on our hands and cheer economic  calamity along.   We all need to do our part by protesting and making noise to help the opposition blossom.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-29T11:22:18,12
"wake me up when he actually loses republican support enough to lose supermajorities, otherwise none of this matters",whatproblems,2025-04-29T17:37:57,8
"The good thing is, given a poll like this a lot of his agenda would have a hard time passing congress. The past 100 days he barely passed anything in the congress.  The bad thing is, he doesn't need to care about the poll because he has the power already. He can write EO to become law, and disregard the court meanwhile taking away budget and tax power from congress.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-29T11:15:59,3
None of that matters though. It's not like he can run again (no matter what he says) so his polls can continue to drop and it has no effect on him.,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T10:55:12,4
The number surprisingly high. 42% something like that approval.,More-Dot346,2025-04-29T12:56:38,2

This couldn’t have happened in October?,Internal_Swing_2743,2025-04-29T11:17:12,1
let me know when Trump collapses,chadbot3k,2025-04-29T19:36:29,1
I invite you to join us at r/tinyprotest to start protesting NOW!,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-30T06:50:48,1
"But maybe they will affect his party for years to come. That's the hope anyway, they can't scrape this dog-shit off their shoes and pretend the shit-prints are not all over the constitution and their voters. Yes, some, heck maybe even most, of their voters will turn around and vote for them again anyway, but if enough turn and enough independents tire of dog shit constantly on the carpet, then we will see what happens.",BoarnotBoring,2025-04-29T11:01:53,3
"If he’s not dead, he will run again.  And he will “win”.   It doesn’t matter that the law says 2 terms.  The fact that he has already floated the idea and is selling merchandise should tell you all you need to know - that he will run again.",sdbrews,2025-04-29T11:09:51,2
It probably will in 28. But by 30/32 it will switch back.  Weve done this song and dance over and over,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T11:02:59,5
"I don't engage in conspiracy level stuff   If he somehow runs again he will be crushed, especially since it would open the door for Obama to run again. Which the Dems would have to be completely stupid not to run in that instance.",AleroRatking,2025-04-29T11:25:08,0
"If we just accept the gloom and doom we will never get a change. I hear you, I'm not even saying your wrong, but saying things along the lines of ""it will never change"" only serves the oppressor, never the oppressed.",BoarnotBoring,2025-04-29T11:04:58,2
"What gives you the impression it would be a fair election?  If he’s corrupt enough to run for a third time, he’s sure as hell corrupt enough to rig it.",Cricket_Piss,2025-04-29T16:33:40,2
I'm not even sure I call it doom and gloom if the Republicans can take some losses and get away from MAGA  The last thing I want is one party dominating.,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T11:08:33,1
The elections arent fixed. I don't buy into this conspiracy level garbage,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T17:20:13,1
"I’m not saying they are, but if it gets to that point they very well may end up being so.  I’m not sure why it’s so inconceivable that Trump may attempt something like that.",Cricket_Piss,2025-04-29T17:21:25,2
