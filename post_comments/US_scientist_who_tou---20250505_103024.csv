During a later investigation, **officials at Rhodes maintained that their institution had never awarded him a Ph.D**.In 2007, Hatfill's lawyer Tom Connolly‚Äì in his lawsuit against former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and the FBI ‚Äì admitted that his client had ""[p]uffed on his resume,"" falsely claiming he had earned a PhD and **had ""[f]orged a diploma"" for the PhD**   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Hatfill",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-05T10:36:37,180

There were studies in which patients using hydroxychloroquine recovered more quickly from covid. Maybe some of the magas will show up here to cite these for us!  There were studies in which hydroxychloroquine made no difference in covid recovery time. The magas won't be mentioning these.  Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-parasite medicine. The former studies were in countries where parasitic infections are fairly common. The latter studies were in countries where parasitic infections are uncommon.
