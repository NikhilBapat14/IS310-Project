Isn’t Hesgeth the one who put a make-up room in the Pentagon?  Does he do videos?,restore_democracy,2025-04-26T04:51:49,113

Jesus.. is that really what Fox News is like? No wonder the country is so fucked. It's like a live broadcast of a 4chan thread or some incel message board from the 2000s,NegativeSpeech,2025-04-26T06:30:14,41

They mean the other Pete (Dept. of D.T.'s) and his Pentagon make-up room. For the metro warfighters. You can't make this crazy shit up,Stonegrown12,2025-04-26T06:09:41,10

They’re cooking up excuses to stop inviting him on.  Pete was one of the only democrat surrogates who would go on Fox in 2024. Yang put his hand up to do it (or whatever else they needed) but the campaign left him on read.,yoghurken,2025-04-27T02:28:22,1

I saw a post with some comments from the video he was in and even some Trump supporters were shocked at how well he answered questions and composed himself   I absolutely loathe fox news or anything under its branding but if even some MAGA were impressed seems like I should check it out,blues111,2025-04-26T04:49:44,28

">""you have to go into the media bubble in order to pop it""  metaphoric words like that sound all nice, but literally mean nothing.  Please show evidence of this so-called ""bubble popping"" by Dems going on such networks.  cause guess what. it doesn't happen.  we're talking about Fox News, a MAGA network that spews insane propaganda, that has the *tightest* grip on its messaging, and a rabidly pro-Republican audience.  there's a reason why they allow only certain types of Democrats even on.   Dems like Pete suck up to the right-wing, and ""play nice"" and cordial.   Dems that can *actually* call them on their shit and pop bubbles, *do not* get brought on.  So while it's a nice sentiment, you can't show that this actually happens.  People who watch Fox News are not going to have their ""media bubble popped"" by Dems like Pete.",chi823,2025-04-26T16:42:32,1

"are you kidding me?  we have that now.

"He also doesn't fall for their attempts at ""gotcha"" questions. He's calm, smart, and deconstructs their arguments and turns it back at them with facts and reasoning.

I help with a few charity programs on top of my job and that's about all I want to do during the average month, so I understand why it's hard to affect positive change.  Affecting positive change doesn't pay nearly as well as affecting change for lobbyists and the dollar is the bottom line for most people.",DroDameron,2025-04-26T05:54:48,12

I agree, I hate that I have to support establish Democrats. I just see all of their cons also exist within the Republicans. I knew Biden wasn't going to do much for my student debt, but I knew for a fact Trump would do nothing.

"Overall, there are many people better suited or more electable than Pete. Just from the '16 debate stage. Warren would be more preferable, but less electable. Bernie as well. Newsome is more electable, but less preferable. Booker could get my vote. How the next 2-4 plays out matters, it's a bit early to really vote.    None of it will matter tho given the judiciary and congress. We've fixated on solving our problems through just the president for so long, it's no surprise we got a dictator as a country. ",lawrensj,2025-04-26T07:12:40,0
"It's funny because Butigieg, from what I've seen, actually reminds me of Bernie somewhat. I don't mean style wise necessarily, but they both seem to me to have the ability to speak to Republicans and be respectfully received without the conversation escalating into an all out yelling match. That's the type of discourse we don't often see anymore.",biscuitarse,2025-04-26T07:19:44,1
