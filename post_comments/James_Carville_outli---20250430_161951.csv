"> ""This is that time for the Democrats to come alive,"" Carville said. ""The big, beautiful bill is going to carry about four and a half trillion dollars in tax cuts primarily focused on wealthy people. The country doesn't need that. The Democrats need to stand up to it   And a month ago, Carvilles advice was to sit back and do nothing while the Republicans self-destructed",biscuitarse,2025-04-30T16:29:27,18
"This old timer still lives in 1990s, which a free election is a given. We are focusing on protecting US democracy, and he is still playing rolling over and let Trump does Hitler things so we can win the next election.  You know what the smart people back in Germany did in 1933? Exactly what Carville does and thinks the same way. Trump is not eyeing the next election, and if his speed continues we can't barely make the next 100 days before deporting US Citizen. Wait they already did.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-30T16:30:47,9

"Even if James Carville was entirely on point and said exactly the correct strategy for Democrats, I wouldn't want to hear it from him. That's because, in my opinion, one of the most important components of that winning strategy for Democrats should be to stop putting people like James Carville out front.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-30T16:34:18,8

"So he claims:  > Democrats have candidates who are ""staggeringly more talented"" than Sanders and AOC, and it's time to start getting these alternative candidates in front of voters.  But I actually think its good for politicians like Bernie and AOC to be fiercely attacking this early. Then closer to election you get smoother talkers like Buttigieg, Shapiro, or Pritzker out there.",AWall925,2025-04-30T16:57:02,3

"He's the champion of an appeal-to-the-center approach that's performed progressively less well every time the Dems have tried it in the last two decades. His stance is one which necessarily excludes concessions to leftist-minded constituents in the name of palatability to corporate and high-wealth backers.  The results of Kamala's appeals to the center last year, coupled with the comparative surge of support for leftist politicians like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, should say all that needs to be said about where Carville's line of thinking leads these days.",TenthSpeedWriter,2025-04-30T16:34:18,9
