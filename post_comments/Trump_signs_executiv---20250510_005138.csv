"“The migrants would be paid once their arrival in another country is confirmed through the app, according to DHS. “  Zero percent chance they get paid once confirmed out of the country ",elk_1337,2025-05-10T01:09:49,36
There’s a non-zero chance this gets abused and a bunch of money disappears.,ShrimpieAC,2025-05-10T03:17:52,15
"So, after Mexico was supposed to pay for the wall, the new plan is for individuals to deport themselves and presumably fund it too? The art of the deal seems to be evolving in some truly unexpected directions.",d3nisechurro,2025-05-10T01:22:44,11

"Project Homecoming: where leaving the U.S. is rewarded, but staying means facing the consequences. Can I get in on this self-deportation deal? I hear New Zealand has great healthcare and fewer executive orders.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-10T06:38:24,6
"We are almost all immigrants to this country. Question is are we the natives or the dead rabbits. ( gangs of NY) . Every group of immigrants have suffered prejudice on arrival Irish , Italian etc. They are all proud Americans now and rejoice in their proud heritage . Latin Americans are the new fall guys , hard working honest people. This horseshit about illegal immigration’s is an example of our discriminatory policies. These intrepid and hard working folks are exactly who make the best citizens. They are only technically illegal because we only allow 10k legal immigrants from any country a year . So applying for legal residency can mean a 20 year wait. Unless you are one of the tech savvy or top 1% intelligence. The Indian subcontinent has exported its best to us . ALL my doctors and my financial guys are of Indian descent. My wife’s great grandfather worked at the slaughter house also and no Americans will do stoop labor to pick our vegetables, to get their children a better life. We took this country by force , enslaved people to work it and now we need these hard working immigrants to help us populate it .",Adept-Procedure4555,2025-05-10T07:04:26,3
"I still can't go over the fact that he's calling immigrants ""aliens"" as if they weren't even human beings. First dehumanization, then deportation under false motives, no due process whatsoever... This guy violates the constitution of this country on a daily basis and he's not impeached... What a world we live in",A_Chad_Cat,2025-05-10T06:58:38,3

There's no reason not to pay.  People will stop using it if they don't and 1000 bucks is significantly cheaper than a real deportation.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-10T02:41:40,0
They will. If people start saying “we never got our money” then no one will use the app,luckyluchianooo,2025-05-10T01:40:32,-2
Even better. 500 mln illegal migrants are deported. $500 bln paid. America is great again. Another win for Trump.,vkarabut,2025-05-10T04:23:59,1
speaking of the wall has trump even done anything with that yet,saiyanscaris,2025-05-10T04:07:35,3
"I was thinking the same thing. I will happily self-deport to Australia, New Zealand, most of Europe, or Canada. I'm not even that picky.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-10T07:34:12,3
"Yep. MAGA people have a rude awakening coming when they have no landscaper to do their yard, no one to pick their produce, and no one to do all the other jobs they fancy themselves too good for.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-10T07:38:07,1

"“Alien” meant from another country before it meant from another planet. It means foreign, not space monster",Dear_Wing_4819,2025-05-10T09:51:45,1
$1000 is not enough to be much of a consideration in the decision of whether to self deport or not.,Limberine,2025-05-10T03:09:54,8
"The reason not to pay is the suffering, but a copy of my own comment:  If everyone's options become ""I'm going to get renditioned to a prison camp OR I can self deport and maybe get $$$"" they are going to take option 2, whether there's actually a payday or not.",elk_1337,2025-05-10T06:35:26,5
No reason not to pay? These fucking criminals fascists won’t pay a cent. Anyone who thinks they will is a MAGA rube.,stinkywrinkly,2025-05-10T10:30:56,1
