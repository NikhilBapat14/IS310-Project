"What I don't get about this whole situation is.  Trump literally campaigned on tariffs.  Basically any time he talked for more than a few minutes; he talked about tariffs.  There were also strong indications in Project 2025 and Trump just talking that he was moving towards a heavy tariff so he could eliminate/lower income taxes.  Yet, these assholes all supported him and never called him out on it.  Not only that, he clearly didn't understand how tariffs work on even the most basic level, yet no reporters even remotely touched on it.  No one called him out once (that I saw) to say ""Mr. Trump, you've made claims that you'll institute tariffs but have the other countries pay for it.  Tariffs are paid by the importer, not the exporter.  How exactly do you plan to have the exporter pay the tariff tax?""  So honestly, this is 100% on these rich assholes and media types because they never called Trump out on this bullshit.  The core belief of most Trumpers is that ""Trump is a good business man.  He knows what he's doing.""  Why not prove that Trump actually doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about when it comes to actual business shit?  Like fundamentally doesn't understand how tariffs work.  Why not just prove he's an old clueless fuck?  It's so frustrating having to go through this as a business person because I just got 30-40% price increases on Chinese goods.  If the tariffs go through with Vietnam, where most of my vendors moved as much as they could in 2018-2022, everything in my store is about to go up 50%+.  I really really really don't want to have to continue to deal with this absolute fucking insanity.",rossmosh85,2025-04-23T10:55:36,23

We're about to have a massive shortage of everything, and as a result, have a massive spike in inflation. Guess what caused all that? Trump's trade war and his tariffs. Someone finally got to him and told him he was about to see a lot of scarcity and a lot of inflation, and now he's trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube. Problem is, China already told him to go fuck himself, and they're doing business with other countries. They didn't need to export to the US. Trump picked the worst way to fight with the worst possible trading partner. Even if Trump got down on his hands and knees and begged China to start shipping again like they used to (he would never in a million years), China would still tell him to fuck off. There's no guarantee that Trump wouldn't turn around in a couple weeks and start yelling and raising tariffs again.",tampaempath,2025-04-23T12:40:36,12

"It doesn't matter. I don't think folks understand what has already happened and what is already baked in. This is my field, this is my degree, this is what I know.  The only market not going to be completely devastated is your local farmers market. Every single business requires stuff to operate. Not just the things they sell, but supplies.  Lets look at three businesses. Your local Subway Franchise. Your Local Ace Hardware. Your Local Grocery Store.   Each of these have to make more money than they spend to stay in business and pay their employees. With food, raw materials, and goods now more expensive to buy it means their profit margin goes down. Jobs will be cut, business locations will become less stable and may end up closing.  These business don't just buy what they need every day or every week. The incoming goods are planned well in advance, months even years. Contracts signed can't be broken without huge fees or lost business relationships. These businesses STILL have to sign contracts RIGHT NOW for the future. They can't be delayed that long which means they have to GUESS at future prices and supply and many will guess wrong.   Subway doesn't know what food is going to cost to buy from Mexico, or how much the limited supply of American grown food will rise in cost. Ace doesn't know how much shovels, and camping stoves, and nails will go up either. Empty shelves are coming. Price hikes are coming. Layoffs are coming.  Your local grocery store depends on its suppliers all having their product ready when they say they're going to be ready, in the quantity they promised in their contract. The food is there, on time, not rotting because the trucks that moved it were planned in advance, to pick it up from trains and ships that were planned in advance, packed with food that was picked where it was grown planned in advance.  That just simply isn't going to happen in a massive world wide trade war.   We're royally fucked. Nothing has happened yet. All the chaos you see so far is fear. We're still coasting on previously signed agreements. Soon those deliveries will be complete, contracts will expire, and cargo ships will idle or sail empty.   If you remember what it was like trying to shop during the first 6 months of covid, get ready for that again.  This time instead of everyone working together to try and hold it together, its a self inflicted wound with no method of ending it. Trump could 'reverse everything' to how it was 6 months ago and we'd still suffer for it.  The future is only a matter of how awful it will be.",Slyfox00,2025-04-23T14:01:57,10

It's seriously one of the best things you can watch to understand just how deeply we are fucked. In one of the first segments of the video one of the companies that builds PC cases shows the entire world their cost structure and exactly how tariffs kill that product for the US market.  The conclusion is that the US is going to lose a lot of products simply because it doesn't make sense to 1) ship them here, and 2) build them here.  You're never going to build a PC motherboard in the US because the board requires a 1000 components, and each component is built often by a single factory in China. Assuming you can move the majority of those factories to the US you *still* have labor cost differences to worry about. Your $200 motherboard will *not* be $200 once it's fully built in the US. It's going to be $1000. Or more. Easily.  The guys building the PC case previously mentioned said that even *with* the tariffs and them paying their MSRP in *just tariffs*, it is still cheaper to ship it to the US than build here.

"""There will be empty shelves!""  Erma-Gerd! What will I do when I go out shopping and have nothing to look at and not buy?  Basically, Americans aren't gonna pay massive prices for any products, and resellers aren't eating the shit sandwich that are tariffs. They tried $18 dozen eggs, people literally stopped buying. That was the toe in the water. The water was cold. Ice cold.  Heard at a national electronics distributor HQ today:  ""Well 90-110% tariffs is better than the 180% tariffs we have now!""  ""Not much.""  ""Well, it's manageable. Which is ridiculous when everybody was screaming about 50-60% tariffs a month or two ago. We have to cut spending to keep enough in the bank to pay tariffs as soon as shipments hit the ports, or we won't even have anything to sell.""  Services spending like professional services, outsourced services, IT, etc. is going to crash if this goes on much longer. Companies who pay for all these smaller business services can't afford to keep massive stashes of cash in the bank to pay for tariffs. Those who can, are cutting spending, those who can't, have just stopped spending.  We're heading towards a doubling of prices on every physical product we buy for the foreseeable future. Everybody better learn how to DIY everything, because if Team Trump is absolutely adamant about seeing this through, we're all going to find out what happens when retail sales hit zero frickin' dollars.

"It was always obvious.   It’s called “conscious of guilt”. The most obvious base psychology ever.   I had ChatGPT help the rolling stone. It wrote this at my request.  My Request: Write a rolling stone article citing a myriad of examples of trump displaying “consciousness of guilt”  Sure thing—here’s a Rolling Stone-style article that explores the concept of Donald Trump displaying “consciousness of guilt,” with a voice and structure reminiscent of their political features.  ⸻  “He Knows What He Did”: The Many Ways Donald Trump Shows He’s Guilty as Hell By Rolling Stone Political Staff  In criminal law, there’s a telling little phrase—“consciousness of guilt.” It means actions that suggest a person knows they’ve done something wrong, and they’re trying to cover it up, deflect, or otherwise protect themselves. In Donald Trump’s case, the signs aren’t subtle. They’re neon-bright and blaring through a bullhorn.  From obstructing investigations to pressuring witnesses, Trump’s playbook looks less like the behavior of a wrongly accused man and more like a masterclass in how to act when you’re terrified of the truth coming out.  Let’s take a tour through some of Trump’s greatest hits—moments that prosecutors and legal analysts have flagged again and again as textbook “consciousness of guilt.”  ⸻  1. “I just want to find 11,780 votes.”  In the infamous call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on January 2, 2021, Trump didn’t simply claim fraud—he asked for a specific number of votes to be “found,” just enough to flip the state.  That wasn’t a request to investigate. That was a mob boss asking for a fix. It was so bad, Georgia’s Republican secretary of state had the presence of mind to record it—and the world heard Trump laying bare his panic over losing.  ⸻  2. “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth?” (Then: Trump takes the Fifth over 400 times.)  Back in 2016, Trump said, “The mob takes the Fifth. If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”  Fast-forward to 2022. During a deposition with the New York Attorney General in the civil fraud case against him and the Trump Organization, Trump invoked the Fifth over 400 times.  Even more telling: He refused to answer even basic questions about his own business. That’s not just legal strategy. That’s a guy who knows every word could open a new door to prosecution.  ⸻  3. “Will no one rid me of this meddlesome special counsel?”  Okay, he didn’t literally say that. But according to Robert Mueller’s report, Trump tried—repeatedly—to get officials to fire Mueller or otherwise derail the Russia investigation. When that didn’t work, he tried to get witnesses to change their stories or refuse cooperation.  Mueller famously stopped short of charging obstruction, but laid out the evidence for Congress. That evidence? It read like a guilty man flailing to stop the walls from closing in.  ⸻  4. “Don’t testify. You’re taken care of.”  During the Mueller probe, Trump’s allies reportedly dangled pardons in front of witnesses like Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, and Roger Stone. In Stone’s case, Trump commuted his sentence entirely just before he was set to report to prison.",ipostthingsonreddit,2025-04-23T08:33:24,-31

"I vividly remember seeing a chart that showed like the price of food staples in Egypt, Tunisia, and the other countries where the Arab Spring went the hardest and it spikes immediately before people took to the streets. You can have plenty of various economic, political, and social issues that are the underlying root causes of riots and unrest but what usually motivates people in the streets breaking up the sidewalk into throwable projectiles and pouring accelerant into liquor bottles to throw at armored police trucks is concrete literal bread and butter issues like the very price of food, or something viscerally upsetting and inciting like police brutality/murder exacerbating already existing issues. Look at the George Floyd uprising. Police have killed people in America plenty of times, more than a thousand people every year or thereabouts. But Floyd was killed 1. Very publicly and in a particularly violent way and it evoked the same kind of outrage that the Rodney King video did 2. It happened in the middle of a pandemic that had everyone unemployed and at home and much more plugged in than they normally would have been so it was able to go viral while virtually EVERYONE was watching 3. Everyone is already unemployed and hungry and anxious about putting food on the table and keeping their homes   Yeah, Trump is playing with fire here. America is a tinderbox and food riots I fear would be a fatal blow to there ever being a stable government in the US for the foreseeable future I think it would be a tipping point into full on civil fracture and maybe even civil war.

"Can you imagine what that media coverage would actually have to look like for the point to resonate with their viewers?   In my view it would require the respective media outlets that lionized Trump to do a complete 180 in messaging destroying their credibility in the process:  >  > ""Welcome to Fox News, our top story tonight is actually about the credibility of Fox News...we present ourselves as a news agency or as entertainment when legally convenient but the truth is we are a propaganda network whose sole purpose is to manipulating the American public into believing an alternative reality of our own creation to aid in facilitating, providing cover for and assisting the agenda of Republican leadership.  >  > For instance, when Mr Trump claimed he'd institute tariffs but have the other countries pay for it...we declined to point out that Trump had a fundamental misunderstanding about how by definition tariffs are paid by the importer, not the exporter...because it was politically convenient for Republican leadership not to contradict the President and for Trump's base to misunderstand how tariffs imposed by Trump increase the prices of imported goods for Americans.   >  > This is just a single example but dear viewers, consider all the propaganda and lies you've allowed yourself to digest over the years watching our 'news' program and you ought to understand how useful our media outlet has been for the administration.  >  > Why should you believe us now at this very moment as we tell you how you've been manipulated by us? Primarily the owners of Fox News have decided their billions of dollars are more valuable if they aren't valued at par with the Ruble and so Fox News leadership has decided to suspend propaganda broadcasting in an effort to reverse the damage done to the American Dollar.""   Okay, I can't actually continue the creative writing exercise. There simply is no reason Fox News, other outlets or any of the social media would burn their respective influence machines to the ground. The degree of power that they wield is just too valuable to destroy for the betterment of the American public.  edit: Charlie Brooker, if you're reading this, take the idea and run with it for a new episode of Black Mirror.

"> President Donald Trump radically softened some of his most severe rhetoric after CEOs of the nation’s biggest retail chains warned him of looming price rises and empty shelves.  > The CEOs of Walmart, Target, and Home Depot met privately with Trump on Monday and told him that although prices were steady at that moment, his trade policies could have devastating effects within just two weeks with supply chains disrupted, Axios reported.  > “This wasn’t about food. But he was told that shelves will be empty,” a source told the outlet.  > The president was also reportedly spooked by investors’ reaction to his threats to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Stocks, bonds, and the dollar all slumped this week—until Trump abruptly toned down his statements.  > He told reporters on Tuesday he didn’t plan to play hardball with China, and that he was confident the two countries could strike a deal that would bring the tariffs well below their current levels.  > “145 percent is very high and it won’t be that high,” he said, according to CNN. “It won’t be anywhere near that high. It will come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.”  > Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told investors at a closed-door event hosted by JPMorgan Chase that the president’s trade war was unsustainable and he expected it to de-escalate.  > In response, the markets rallied after a major sell-off Monday, with the Dow gaining 1,017 points and closing up 2.66 percent. The S&P 500 rose 2.51 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.71 percent.  > Trump also told reporters on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell—less than a week after writing on social media, “Powell’s termination can’t come fast enough!”  > The president’s top economist, Kevin Hassett, had also confirmed that Trump and his team were studying how to take the unprecedented step of removing the Fed chair.  > But the president’s advisors reportedly warned him that getting rid of Powell could cause as much market turmoil as his trade war, according to CNN.  > That news was also cheered on Wall Street, where Dow futures shot up 750 points, or 1.9 percent, on Wednesday morning. S&P 500 futures went up 2.6 percent, and Nasdaq futures rose 3 percent.  > U.S. Treasury bond sales were also up.  > The changes reportedly come as Bessent has been able to exert a stronger influence on Trump. Bessent had warned for months that firing Powell could lead to a prolonged legal battle, according to CNN.  > He has also pushed Trump to adopt more targeted tariffs, whereas Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has encouraged the president to aggressively impose universal duties.  > When other advisers aren’t around, Bessent rushes the Oval Office to lobby Trump to take a more market-friendly approach, according to Axios.  > This week, the International Monetary Fund warned that Trump’s economic policies had caused a “major negative shock” to growth in the global financial system.  > The president announced a “Liberation Day” on April 2 as he unveiled universal 10 percent tariffs against all products entering the U.S. from other countries. Additional tariffs were added for products from countries that have trade deficits with the U.S.  > The duties are an import tax paid by American companies, with the added costs typically passed on to consumers. Other countries have vowed to retaliate against the measures, including China, which hit all U.S. products with its own 125 percent tariffs.  > The trade wars have sent global stock markets tumbling—wiping out trillions of dollars in value—and even shaken the usually stable U.S. bond markets.  > Some financial authorities are consequently fearful that the U.S. is heading toward recession. Trump was reportedly unfazed by the prospect of a recession but privately expressed concern that his tariffs could lead to a more severe depression before he agreed to halt levies on dozens of countries for 90 days.  > The duties on Chinese products, however, remain in effect.",HallucinogenicFish,2025-04-23T08:41:13,5

"Part of the tariffs greatly effect raw materials. I used to work in food packaging. A very high percentage of packaging or raw materials for packaging comes from China. Plus machinery for packing, sorting, shipping, etc.    Maybe the food is canned or bottle in jersey but so much of the supply chain comes from overseas. And our entire supply chain is made to be just in time. Meaning a minor interruption cascades. That's why TP was out of stock. A small run on buying, slowdown of the supply chain due to port closures, and companies closing in Asia that process raw paper... and boom no TP.    So strawberries may come from Florida or California but the packaging, sorting materials, cleaning inputs, etc all come from overseas. Add to that a direct loss of the lowest wage workers (illegal or otherwise) and you will see huge disruptions in the food chain.    We are seeing it already on smaller operations. Or the food will just get more expensive. So a bag of apples will cost $1 more. So now people will buy less food overall.    Going to get interesting.

China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.

"Change need not always be physical. Trump’s rhetoric alone drove companies into higher pricing. I’m more in tune with the computer side of this, but to give you an example Cyberpower PCs, an all American company, we’re literally in depression because of tariffs because they couldn’t predict them  The main threat of Trump’s tariffs weren’t the tariffs themselves. It’s how he did it. Just blanket tariffs on every industry you can think of that changed on a day by day basis. If he’d even just kept his ""liberation day” tariffs as a constant 10% across the board, prices would go up proportionally and be left at that.   But instead, companies had to weigh on every word that came out of this loons mouth and try to predict future pricing. If he mentions China in a press conference then the company goes into red alert trying to figure out what this means for  Them and generally it means raising prices ahead of a tariff so they don’t start selling at a loss. Remember, this isn’t luxury brands where items are already priced up by 600-700%, this is bare essentials that we’re making a minuscule profit trying to ensure that their business doesn’t go under.   It’s also why the stock market has been so volatile, Trump’s stand off with Powell  was basically economic Armageddon for them. Having some assurance that the worst won’t come to pass gives them the peace of mind to do what they do.  Think of the economy as an abused dog.

"Also the lack of farm labor and cost of farm inputs are looking ugly.  I live in rural America. Out here, the farms and ranches rely on Hispanic labor for a massive amount of the actual work that gets done to bring food to American tables. It’s not a “they’re cheaper” situation - it’s a “the labor doesn’t exist if they’re not here” situation. These rural areas are dying, elderly, and incapable of raising a proper workforce without them.  We’re deliberately deporting and terrifying those people. Shackling people’s hands and feet and throwing random immigrants with no criminal conviction into El Salvador’s gang torture death prison is a good way to ensure your farm labor force doesn’t show their faces in public.  The imports are an issue, but domestic production isn’t looking good either. It’s the season for putting that future food in the ground and the cost of doing so this year is going to be substantially different than normal. The effects of this will take awhile to show up (things have to be grown, fertilized, taken care of, harvested, transported, processed, transported, shelved), but I can tell you right now that there isn’t a single part of that entire chain that isn’t going to feel it from the bottom up.  And that doesn’t just affect America. America is the world’s largest food exporter. Yes, we import massive amounts too (a slight surplus recently - and we can’t grow a mango very well in Texas) but the foods we -export- (like corn) are core staple foods that important for the nutrition of billions of people globally. In terms of raw calories, we export significantly more calories than we import. We help feed the planet… or we used to.  People will die because of this. USAID’s overnight shuttering alone is already starting to kill people in the most destitute parts of the world. The double whammy of increased costs on the food that does show up is going to hurt. Death toll will be in the millions when we’re done and looking back (the death toll just from USAID going away will be that high, let alone any of this other nonsense).  And that’s if things don’t get worse…",teachersecret,2025-04-23T09:22:41,207

"This is a surface level view.  The USD is weakening against currencies that are in the DXY basket (Yen, CHF, Euro, etc..).  There are specific reasons that is happening.  Yen - The Yen Carry Trade when reversed brings Yen back to Japan.  The result is selling of USD and purchasing JPY.  CHF - The Swiss Frank is a flight to safety currency, this week it hit a 14 year high.  Euro - A significant pairing to USD (in DXY), it acts as a volatility trigger in many ways which impacts the USD.  All of those result in selling of USD and purchasing the local currencies, which causes the appearance of the USD weakening.  When compared against emerging market currencies the USD is still performing relatively strongly.  The US imports a good portion of its needs from emerging markets.  Compounding this is the tariffs and confusion about how much they are, when they apply, how they apply, what idiot thought they were a good idea.  In most cases though, when selling USD the nations are selling treasury bonds.  So now you're in a position where the treasury market becomes unbalanced, interest rates rise and debt based economies (and consumers i.e. car loans, mortgages) suffer.  That puts significant strain on banks (large holders of treasuries) and institutions (like Hedge Funds) and can causes widespread market disruptions.  It's why the Fed is already rumored to be putting a TWO TRILLION dollar bailout package together for Hedge Funds alone.  The emerging markets however need USD to operate (they are primarily buyers/borrowers of treasuries).  So while it is cheaper for some countries to get treasuries, the countries that rely on them (and the US who relies on their economic exports) still experience higher costs.  You aren't ""wrong"" in the sense that all of those things can potentially happen, especially given the current administration.  Just on a currency level there is much more at play here than simply ""USD is weakening"".",qtain,2025-04-23T11:55:40,1

So my personal theory behind Peter is this   He is a smart kid  He wasn’t wealthy   He was smart enough to get a PHD from Harvard. While there he saw a bunch of the idiot rich kids and learned to hate them.   He sees the CEO class as a bunch of the Harvard rich kids he hates.   He then thinks I am smarter than those spoiled rich kids and anything they think is good must be bad.   And from that point of defiance he then works backwards. CEOs think trade is good this it must be bad.   An interesting side note to this is Trump. From my understanding Trump was always annoyed that a lot of the rich upper class in NYC hated him. And Trump being the narcissist he is probably has the same idea as Navarro that anyone who I don’t like is wrong so I am going to do the opposite of what they say.   So Navarro and Trump both have emotional reasons to treat trade this way. And that explains the doubling down and the reluctance to see the light.,Mattieohya,2025-04-23T09:48:06,1

Also passing exams and such is not a measure of intelligence anyways... nor a measure of subject matter competency depending on how its done.

So China spent years creating and controlling an intricate supply chain of highly valuable minerals (that are critical to the highest tech industries) to the point they have a monopoly.

"This perpetuates misunderstandings about the rare earth supply chains while specifically demonstrating their relevance. There very much are mines in North America where we could source rare earth ores containing viable quantities of dysprosium and while China is itself the largest source of dysprosium ore it’s not a complete monopoly of ore production. The key supply choke point is not necessarily the mine and mineral extraction for dysprosium or indeed most rare earths. Weathering in the eastern Himalayas does produce some of the best deposits but it produces a comparative advantage not exclusive control. The main issue is that separating the individual rare earth elements and purifying them is an extremely complex and involved process requiring extensive infrastructure. That is what China basically has a monopoly on, I think for dysprosium it is an effective monopoly though there have been pilot projects elsewhere.",Unit266366666,2025-04-24T05:34:33,1

"T bills (treasury bonds) are debt that other countries buy from us, we borrow from them. They are seen as a safe  investment and usually when the stock market swings wildly, people turn to bonds as there is less risk.  That is not happening this time.   I'm in Europe, and what *is* going on is that the rest of the world is either not buying them or cashing them in. That's a recipe for hyperinflation, and a sign that foreign investors no longer see the dollar and the American financial market as 'safe'.   As more countries call that debt in, and less countries invest in America you get something that starts to look a bit like Weimar Germany of the 1930's.   Shit can go sideways, and fast. Stocks fluctuate, bond markets are supposed to be relatively stable. You are seeing a slow motion exodus from the dollar. And it's slow motion only because anything quicker would cause a global crash and actual intelligent finance people know this. This is a careful, slow smothering of the American financial market and it's being done by design by the rest of the world as they shore their wealth somewhere less tumultuous.  Kiss those foreign factory investment dreams goodbye, no one is going to dump a bunch of money into America right now.

I had to point out that it's probably old stock that has been sitting in the US since 2024.  My brain broke at his statement though.

So unless Trump first made it known that this is what he believes I can't imagine how someone could come to this conclusion about tarrifs and trade.  If he wanted to slither into power and work backwards from Trump's conclusion so he can cozy up to him I get that  But personally I don't think Trump even has enough basic knowledge of how trade works to even come to any sort of ridiculous conclusion.  Obviously I'm speculating but it feels like Trump's worldview on this is fully built off of someone else's opinion whether it's Navarro or someone else,ATLfalcons27,2025-04-23T08:53:58,1

Pick a percentage he wrote, and it will almost certainly be a magnitude greater- He also presupposes that stupid people exist in every strata of society regardless of  wealth, education, or social standing. Ignorance and stupidity are two wholly different conditions. Ignorance of a subject is a condition of knowledge, stupidity is an ingrained personality trait.   A stupid person is defined by Cipolla as one who will support positions and take actions which brings harm to themselves and to others without material benefit to either. He also notes that there are people in society who do recognize just how many stupid people exist, and these creatures he calls ""social bandits"".

"Engineers, scientists, doctors and dentists tend to make up the bulk of the ""tax protestors,"" too. Somehow, their rigidity of thinking, their hubris about their own superiority, and their unwillingness to take the time to understand a different discipline, in this case, law, plus their misplaced literalism, and overconfidence in their own grasp of ""logic,"" leads them, along with greed, of course, to bizarre, ahistorical, easily refuted, interpretations of the tax statutes. Legislative history might as well be a foreign country, for them. If a tax statute says ""X is taxable income"" in its first paragraph, and then says ""the X is taxable income rule applies to Federal employees"" in its second paragraph, it is not only a logical fallacy to think that the rule ONLY applies to Federal employees, but it also is blind to legislative history, which pretty much, in such cases, always shows that the second par. was added b/c Federal employees claimed that, in the absense of explicit language, the rule did not apply to them. I once argued with a tax denier (an engineer, of course!) online, about a particular provision of the Tax Code which completely followed this pattern, and which pattern happened to be spelled out, not in a Treasury Ruling, or Tax Court, District Court, or Court of Appeals decision, but in a Supreme Court decision, which painstakingly reviewed the legislative history and left no doubt as to the correct interpretation.

"This is directly related to supply chain. Pre COVID most larger businesses were on a push to reduce inventory on hand as it shows up on their books as a liability. The world economy and trade was in a good spot and the ability to replenish stock took hours, not days, or what is now weeks. This lead businesses to rely entirely short lead times and they hedged their bets that it would always be this way.Once COVID hit and supply chains were strained, to the point of collapse it really showed how dependent the entire world is on each other to keep “items in the shelf.” Most countries and businesses realized the error in their logic and have taken steps to mitigate this risk, dual sourcing, adjusting inventory strategies, opening up new trade partners and routes. Unfortunately the US leadership has since doubled down on bad business in regards to supply chains and now with tariffs this will make things incredibly difficult to keep on the shelf. Once this starts hitting key items people use daily it will get incredibly scary as people rush to clear shelves, think toilet paper during COVID except this time it will be essential foods.",Antique-Scheme-2863,2025-04-23T11:33:15,6

They know.  They don’t care.  They’ll say those people should have cared for themselves. Bootstraps. Muh tax dolluhs!  USAID actually paid for itself. I think at last check every $1 the US government put into USAID came back as $7 in direct gdp growth and savings on a wide variety of things (I could get into this in some depth, but the point is, shuttering USAID means we, as Americans, are going to effectively be paying to kill all those people abroad, since the negative economic impacts on us all will dwarf the tiny little budget that USAID used to spend).  Sartre wrote a piece about this, many years ago. I’ll paraphrase from memory: Never believe that these people aren’t aware of at least some of their absurdities. They know their remarks are often lies. They are amusing themselves. It is the burden of the truthful to care about the power of words. They have no such burden.

"That’s because Engineers don’t actually do Science. They take the settled parts of Science, and then find practical applications.   Engineers know what is known to work, stay inside those lines, and make things happen. This gives them a lot of unearned confidence, because they look at PhDs trying things that have never been done *and not succeeding immediately*… and assume they know better because they get results.  They usually don’t stop and think about how the body of Scientific Knowledge was accumulated. If they aren’t making rockets or microchips; then they don’t worry about too much past Newton, except updating equations with better constants.  Actual Science is hard to do. It’s a lot of spinning wheels, poking the Darkness, and writing shit down. It’s a lot of 3AM Coffee Breaks while you stare at things that aren’t behaving like you expected, and then trying to figure out what rogue variable you don’t know about so that your next experiment might actually stand a chance of publication. It’s failure after failure after *maybe that was something*… because literally nobody knows what you’re trying to find out.  Engineers get to play around in the light, where the scientists already procured clarity. They don’t usually trip over the unexpected. They have an end goal, they have a set of rules to follow, and they solve the equation. Humility won’t settle in until they draw too close to the edge, to the dark, and get slapped down by something unexpected.  Best example is the GPS Network, which didn’t work the first few weeks it existed because the Engineers ignored the Scientists. The GPS Satellites move fast enough to experience enough Time Dilation that they cease to be reliable, and the Engineers refused to account for that when writing the software. The Network had to be patched to work as intended.",AndrewJamesDrake,2025-04-23T08:57:59,114

"I'm an engineer myself, and it has boggled my mind how many closed-minded fools can design a whole car transmission from the ground up but can't wrap their head around macroeconomics or understand even the first thing about the social sciences. I get that many engineers are mostly clueless when it comes to anything without an equation, but man, some of them have such an egregious lack of understanding of even *basic* human behavior that I don't know how they got to the point of even being adults. The absence of self-awareness would be awe-inspiring if it wasn't so harmful. As someone whose life-long pursuit of science ultimately drew me to engineering, it always used to confuse me how people surrounded by science could think in such a way.  But then again, there's a world of difference between scientists and engineers. Scientists are generally looking to learn more and more to better understand the universe. The good ones have to be open-minded as they must have a more fluid relationship with the laws of physics due to our limited knowledge and understanding at any given moment. They often love to dive into the minutiae of a given theory and can't wait for the chance to discover their own or even prove a long-standing theory incorrect.  However, engineers often have a more rigid relationship with the laws of physics. Since we use the theories that scientists have discovered to design systems and tools, most engineers see those principles as much more defined and immutable. And in their defense, most of the laws of physics used in engineering aren't likely to change anytime soon. If the principle is understood well enough that an engineer can use it reliably to make something with it, then it's likely a well-proven one. Unless you're a research engineer working on the cusp of the leading edge, this will likely hold true. It makes sense that this would either produce rigid thinking, or be likely to draw in people who already have rigid thinking processes.   It's not too much of an issue in the field (and may even be an asset in certain disciplines or cases), but when they apply their rigid thinking to everything else, they create an alternate reality where everything and everyone behaves according to clearly set, defined rules that never change. While it's not true in every case, scientists are generally better at following the evidence to a conclusion. It's literally their job to see their own understanding of things to be ever evolving. Whereas many engineers get too used to setting boundaries, defining specs, and operating within constraints. It definitely shapes many to see everything as clearly defined boxes. When their accomplishments stroke their ego long enough, some will start applying boxes they created themselves to anyone and everything around them. Scientists can absolutely be guilty of this too. It's just that scientists are forced to confront their biases and pre-conceived notions about the world more often. Engineers on the other hand are often in an environment that seems to confirm and cement their biases and perceptions. The irony of that is that an engineer that takes a purely scientific approach will always be a better and more forward-thinking engineer. After all, many of the great engineers of yesteryear were also scientists. If you limit yourself to your current level of knowledge and understanding, you'll never accomplish anything beyond it.

"This makes so much sense. I grew up with engineers and I’m also a  Iraq vet. I read that a lot of suicide bombers were formally trained engineers. I couldn’t understand how a profession that prides itself in logical thinking was blowing themselves up. An act that I thought was emotional (anger).  So I did some more reading and saw that engineers are taught in a binary way of thinking. It works or it doesn’t. It’s right or it’s wrong. If it doesn’t work you need to find the reason why it doesn’t. Scientists are ok working in the unknown. It’s ok to get it wrong. DON’T force the solution. Find the solution. So those bombers were simply doing the logical thing in their head. God says kill the enemy and if you die doing so, you will go to paradise. Simply and easy and not emotional but logical. But this also explains why so many are so conservative. Conservative mentality requires operating in the known. They grew up this way, so this must be the way to grow up and this must be the way it needs to be. No need to change. Why? It worked fine before. So when presented with something socially new they may and many will twist themselves mentally to maintain that original thesis.",Jim-be,2025-04-23T10:38:37,11

"By the mid 1780s, Louis mental health condition was such that he turned for all policy matters to her advice.  She was embroiled in the disgracing of finance ministers Turgot and Necker, when it became first apparent that reforms where needed.  The state finances were that bad, that the then minister of finances as well as the prime minister urged the king and queen to convene the Assembly for the first time in 160 years. Given her influence, it was important for her to attend. She didn't, much to the dismay of the Assembly who perceived it as an attempt to discredit the institute.  She also ousted said minister of finances, steering the king to appoint her own ally De Brienne who would end up prime minister. He pushed massive cutbacks, but at the same time attempted to consolidate and restore absolute power, weakening parliament. At which he failed.  By 1787, she was directly involved in politics as a member of the King Council. She had a direct part in the eviction of the Parliament of Paris and the May Edicts. As well as the convening of the Estates Generales.  By 1789, as the Estates Generales fractured and the Third Estate went on to become the National Assembly, Marie Antoinette had pretty much derailed and stonewalled any attempt of reforms.  She wasn't naive. She was very much aware of the brewing conflict. And she was very much prepared to use force to oppose the Revolution if it came to that.",0x53r3n17y,2025-04-23T13:25:18,13

Perception is more subjective, while reality can be considered objective. Perception is defined as the way of regarding, understanding, or interpreting something; a mental impression.   While reality is defined as the world or the state of things as they actually exist as we know them.  One's perception of reality can be skewed by various stimuli such as the media in particular skews negativity and often sensationalism which can create strong emotional responses and the more we're exposed to it, the more it addict some more than others.   It's hard to tell what factors cause such inconsistencies in comprehension but in a lot of cases, it's that they just don't want to adjust their way of thinking.

Without enough emotional ""intelligence"" (i.e empathy, humility, and such), you can get to a point where people say they are ""logically"" correct about things while having a paper-thin argument because real-world decisions are almost always way more complicated than what you would learn to handle with a logical model, formula, or set of axioms you might be taught in engineering.  This isn't a new thing, by the way. Isaac Newton was very religious, and thought that his discoveries about the world emphasized god's perfection, instead of reducing the rhetorical support for god's existence. Many other famous scientists have had similar missteps in making conclusions outside of their fields of expertise. Eugenics was popular in a time when scientists learned about evolution but before they learned about psychiatry.",nox66,2025-04-23T10:18:41,32

"I'm a physician/ scientist so ""do no harm"" is our first directive. However, with time and experience (almost 3 decades for me), I know the reality is we don't have a lot of answers for medical issues patients face so we have to learn to be flexible with trying new things to help them besides which patients themselves bring up new/ less-tested treatments.  Each physician has to decide for themselves how flexible they want to be and that can vary depending on the patient, condition, treatments available/ inquired about, personal experience, and so on. Many of the best physicians I know of/ recognized by their peers don't just stick to the tried-and-true.",Artistic_Salary8705,2025-04-23T16:38:15,2

Wan had been a big fan of EVs and tested Tesla’s first EV model, the Roadster, in 2008, the year it was released.

"I have a STEM degree. I joked with the head of my course once about wishing I'd studied social science. he looked at me and said, why..engineering we get the right answer or wrong one. The circuit works or it doesn't. There's no grey area. If you do social sciences, it is all grey area. You can do the right thing and get the wrong outcome.    I think a lot of engineers/scientists are like that. They like a black and white world. They don't want any grey, which would mean additional thinking, reading, understanding.

"There used to be this show on SyFy called ""Eureka"" about a secret town that is all advanced R&D scientists and engineers.  The idea is that this town contains all the best and brightest people in one place so they can work on the worlds problems together.  Very utopian.  There's one episode that opens up to a sermon in the town church being given by their pastor.  She knows her audience and one of her lines has stuck with me for the last 20 years.  I can't find the exact quote but it was something to the effect of:  ""Just because we know what causes rainbows and auroras and sunsets doesn't make them any miraculous.  Science is the means by which we name and understand god's miracles, it doesn't render them meaningless.  Meaning is found by the observer.""  I'm not religious but this speaks to me in a big way.  I've seen and experienced things that are nearly beyond words, I've been awed before the power of nature more times than I care to count.  I've been left speechless by the beauty of the universe many more times over.  Just because I know ""nebulae don't ReALLy LoOk LiKe ThOsE CoLoRs"" doesn't take away from the beauty.  Just because I know how the ocean swell works doesn't mean I'm not awed by the power of the sea tossing my ship around like a bath toy.   Just because I know that the Aurora is high energy particles slamming into the magnetosphere doesn't make it less beautiful and mesmerizing.    Einstein said that ""Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.""   He also said that ""God is a mystery, but a comprehensible mystery.  I have nothing but awe when I observe the laws of nature.""  Engineers should have to take a year of philosophy classes.  I know a lot of people who take random art classes to make up their humanities requirements and they almost universally lack the abstract thinking that is needed to ethically navigate the incredible power that we can wield as engineers.  I'm working through my third degree program at this point so I have a lot of other experiences to draw on, and I can honestly say that the most mind expanding course I ever took was ""Science and the Humanities"", a course where we read a new sci-fi novel every week of the semester and dissected the themes and tried to get to what the authors were *actually* trying to say.

"While philosophy might help some people, I actually think it's similarly susceptible in the ways I've described. I think the real education that needs to happen is education about the mind. Explaining why we have emotions, maintaining healthy boundaries, and so on. It helps people become more aware of their own emotions and biases and can then allow them to try to control for them. For example, knowing that anger is fundamentally a defense mechanism helps someone with anger issues understand that they feel like they are being attacked, which then allows them to determine if what they are trying to defend is reasonable (and whether defending it with anger is reasonable in that situation). When you feel some irrational anger, you're much better equipped to recognize it as such.  The most neglected subject for engineers I think is English, specifically on the subjects of rhetorical argument, rhetorical fallacies, and literary analysis and interpretation, because all of these require arguments that are logical but not inherently so, instead just based on one's interpretation.",nox66,2025-04-23T21:19:41,1
