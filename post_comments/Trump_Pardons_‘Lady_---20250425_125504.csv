"Honestly, it's just breathtaking, this whole situation feels like such a betrayal of public trust, especially when you realize jurors found that Michele Fiore promised donors 100% of the contributions would go towards a statue honoring a fallen officer, but instead, she converted the money to cash and spent it on rent, cosmetic procedures, and her daughter's wedding, it just feels unbelievably unfair, and I keep thinking, is this really the justice we expect, where those who exploit grief and steal from a memorial fund for a fallen officer are given a free pass?",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-25T13:14:54,657

"As per [original article](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/trump-is-spitting-in-the-face-of-law-enforcement-president-pardons-lady-trump-for-spending-slain-officer-charity-funds-on-rent-cosmetic-procedures-and-her-daughters-weddin/) üì∞:  - President Donald Trump has granted a ‚Äúfull and unconditional pardon‚Äù to Michele Fiore, the former Las Vegas councilwoman also known as ‚ÄúLady Trump,‚Äù who was convicted of ‚Äúfleecing‚Äù the community out of about $70,000 in a scheme to defraud donors to a charity for a police officer who was killed in the line of duty, using the money she collected for plastic surgeries, rent, and her daughter‚Äôs wedding.  The pardon comes less than a week after U.S. District Court Judge Jennifer Dorsey rejected Fiore‚Äôs attempt to overturn her conviction and grant her a new trial. The clemency was issued less than a month after Trump appointed Sigal Chattah, one of Fiore‚Äôs close friends, as the interim U.S. Attorney for Nevada, The Nevada Independent reported.  Fiore, a former Republican gubernatorial candidate who was a justice of the peace when she was federally indicted on six counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, was convicted on all seven charges following an eight-day trial in October 2024.  Jurors found that when Fiore was still a member of the city council, she solicited donations to build a statue honoring Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Officer Alyn Beck, who was killed while on the job on June 18, 2014. Her solicitations allegedly included a promise that ‚Äú100% of the contributions‚Äù would be put toward creating the statue.  While the statue does, in fact, stand in a flower bed near the entrance of Officer Alyn Beck Memorial Park in Las Vegas, it was raised without any financial assistance from Fiore. Instead, prosecutors said she converted all of the money she solicited from donors ‚Äî more than $70,000 ‚Äî to cash and money orders used ‚Äúfor her own personal benefit.‚Äù  ‚Äú[T]he jury heard from a veritable who‚Äôs who of Nevada business and politics, who wrote checks to Fiore‚Äôs charitable organization or her political action committee in reliance on her promise that 100% of the donations would be used to fund the statue,‚Äù Dorsey wrote in the 77-page order denying Fiore a new trial. ‚ÄúBut the evidence showed that a development company paid for the statue, and not a dime of the money that Fiore raised was used for that purpose. Instead, each check was quickly converted to cash and spent on Fiore‚Äôs personal expenses like rent, cosmetic procedures, and her daughter‚Äôs wedding.‚Äù  She was facing 20 years in prison on each charge and was scheduled to be sentenced next month.  But Fiore will now avoid prison as her attorney, Paola M. Armeni, filed a motion on Thursday to vacate her sentencing date ‚Äúdue to executive grant of clemency.‚Äù  A White House spokesperson told The Hill that Trump issued the pardon because Fiore was allegedly targeted for prosecution due to her ‚Äúoutspoken conservative views.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMichele Fiore, a former RNC Committeewoman and elected official from Nevada, made a name for herself through her outspoken and maverick personality,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúA supporter of President Trump, she was also the first female Republican Majority Leader in the Nevada State Assembly.‚Äù  But many others criticized the pardon as nothing more than a favor for one of Trump‚Äôs political sycophants.  ‚ÄúDonald Trump is spitting in the face of law enforcement. Again,‚Äù Democratic U.S. Senator from Nevada Catherine Cortez Masto wrote on X, formerly Twitter.  State Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat from Las Vegas, shared a similar sentiment.  ‚ÄúMichele Fiore abused her position to defraud Nevadans and our law enforcement community,‚Äù the lawmaker wrote. ‚ÄúPardoning her solely as a reward for political loyalty is yet another embarrassing mockery of justice and the rule of law.‚Äù  Nevada Attorney General Aaron D. Ford wrote: ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs blatant disregard for law enforcement is sickening, and pardoning someone who stole from a police memorial fund is a disgrace.‚Äù",T_Shurt,2025-04-25T12:56:11,79
