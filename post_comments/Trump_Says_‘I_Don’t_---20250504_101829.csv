"***From Rolling Stone’s Peter Wade:***  President Donald Trump, when asked if he has an obligation to uphold the Constitution as president, said, “I don’t know.”  Trump made the disturbing comment during an interview with Kristen Welker on NBC’s Meet the Press while discussing his campaign promise to deport millions of immigrants. Trump, who himself is free because he exploited his own due process rights, has denied those same rights to immigrants he sent without trial to an infamous mega-prison in El Salvador.  “Your Secretary of State says everyone who’s here, citizens and non-citizens, deserve due process. Do you agree, Mr. President?” Welker asked Trump.  “I don’t know. I’m not, I’m not a lawyer. I don’t know,” he said.

"Has a us president ever said that he didn’t know if he needed to uphold the constitution?  No, a U.S. president has never explicitly said they didn’t know if they needed to uphold the Constitution. Upholding the Constitution is a core duty of the presidency, stated in the presidential oath of office, which includes the words:  “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  However, some presidents have acted in ways that critics argued violated the Constitution, and others have made controversial remarks that raised concerns about their views on constitutional limits.  For example: 	•	Richard Nixon, during the Watergate scandal, said: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” — a statement widely interpreted as a challenge to constitutional checks and balances. 	•	Donald Trump, at various times, made remarks that led legal scholars and critics to question his understanding or respect for constitutional constraints. For example, he said Article II of the Constitution gave him “the right to do whatever I want as president”, which drew significant criticism for misrepresenting executive power.
