"Okay, this is just nonsense, at this point.   Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy. It has a mixed-market economy, which means it combines elements of both capitalism and social welfare policies.  While Canada does provide public services such as universal healthcare, public education, and a social safety net (e.g., employment insurance, pensions), these do not make it a socialist regime. These are typical of social democracies, which aim to balance free-market capitalism with social justice.  Thanks for humoring me.",gamefan5,2025-05-06T20:28:39,17

 Riddle me this Canada was the bastion of growth. It was the counter America up until 2008. They were even times where the Canadian dollar would reach dollar parity. Since 2008ish Canada took a much more hardline turn towards socialism and their economy has suffered like none other: Canada was the golden child Now it’s maybe a sixth of the US in partity not in aggregate  In 2007 1.10 usd to get 1 cad  Now it’s .72 to 1  I guess that’s progress in the same sense that 1+1 is 11,endthefed2022,2025-05-06T22:33:03,-1

"I didn't ask you about Canada's economic performance and you haven't defined a single shit about what makes Canada a socialist regime, like a country like Cuba, that is defined as a socialist in every sense of the word, in how it operates.   In case you didn't know, we have companies working in the private sector of pretty much every market and the government is certainly not looking on giving it up, nor the people themselves. Heck, we take advantage of it.   Private Schools (Education), Clinics (Health), Tech, you name it. Even manufacturing. For these companies, they operate independently. And people are also FREE to invest in Canada and operate as they see fit   We are also not ruled by a single party here. We have multiple parties of different spectrums and when a government loses the trust of the other parties, after 18 months, a new election can be declared and the Parliament is dissolved.  I just gave you two easy examples that makes Canada a democratic and a capitalist country.   Unlike your sorry excuse of a government, we don't rewrite history and redefine words to bamboozle the less educated here and cause delusion of highest grandeur   **Give it up.** This is not your expertise and you are wasting everyone's time. And if you believe that Canada is a socialist regime where there is no ounce of capitalism, i e., the people have absolutely no wealth and/or capital, then I will not mince words, **YOU are flat out delusional.**",gamefan5,2025-05-06T22:42:32,10

"Deficit spending,redistribution of wealth, new dental program, new childcare program, 66% capital gains tax, has made Canada uninvestable    I mean, I keep on putting out information to you, but it’s just not important. You’re just redefining what socialism is to fit your own narrative.  Canada is a socialist democracy by every definition. No one said they’re a marxists.  They have capitalist policies, but there’s heavy intervention from the government . Things move a lot slower because government intervention.  Workplace culture is completely different, because a slow pace is is the norm  My Canadian vendors take 24 to 48 hours to respond . You only get one response per day.  Forget about anyone responding to your email after work hours that’s illegal.

"> Something tells me you are a reluctant learner though. That’s not going to help you in life  Spare me the lecture. I am growing tired of your lack kf reading comprehension and the Dunning-Kruger effect is in full display here.  I want you to READ and READ WELL.   The term ""socialist"" is being used here as a blanket label that has lost its meaning due to repeated misuse. In this context, it is incorrectly applied to describe Canada.  This mirrors the way the term ""boomer"" is often used—typically by younger people on the political left—as a pejorative against the older generation. It’s frequently applied regardless of the actual period someone was born in, especially when older voters are perceived as acting against the interests of younger generations. As a result, the term loses its original meaning—rendering any effort to explain its true definition essentially pointless.",gamefan5,2025-05-07T11:30:43,2
