Science? This administration? Trump does science by instinct and RFK seems to be doing it by reading chicken bones. Science is about uncovering objective reality but these people manufacture their own.,YoungestDonkey,2025-04-24T18:43:57,50
">Kennedy, who has no scientific or medical training himself, also seems confused about what a scientifically rigorous investigation would entail—and how long it might take.  I've been reading about the Dunning-Kruger effect.  If someone who has little experience or knowledge about a certain field of study, they tend to overestimate their own ability to master a subject.  RFK Jr. should be the poster boy for the concept.",KapahuluBiz,2025-04-24T19:23:44,14
"I didn't know the brainworms were ever interested in science, they have their agenda and they are working on it.  I see they are playing the long game to removing all  worm medication on the market.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:44:40,9

Apparently science is good…but only if it proves what we want it to prove.   Seems legit.,BannedForEternity42,2025-04-24T21:05:18,4
He’s not doing science. He’s forcing the answer he wants. Claim that autism is caused by vaccinations. Reduce vaccination rates. Start a watch list for anyone with autism. No one registers for the watch list because why would they? Then he declares that he fixed autism.,Lysol3435,2025-04-24T21:10:14,3
This admin wants diversity in science.   The scientific method is so last century.  They would like to introduce alternative science.,grasshopper239,2025-04-24T20:57:01,2
"As a 2nd semester nursing student with prior management experience in a healthcare facility, I am OBJECTIVELY MORE qualified than RFK to be in his position. That should not be true, but it is.",SadBoyStev3,2025-04-25T01:13:02,2

Trump, America is back - leveraging environmental policies rooted in reality to promote economic growth while maintaining the standards that have afforded Americans the cleanest air and water in the world for generations.   >Unlike the previous administration, which wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on virtue signaling and ineffective grifts, the Trump Administration's policies are rooted in the belief that Americans are the best stewards of our vast natural resources - no ""Green New Scam"" required.",justanaccountimade1,2025-04-24T18:58:46,10
I mean even me with no medical school experience (my mom is a nurse if that adds “qualification” lmao) is more qualified than him because at least I read what experts have to say on things before randomly spouting off some conspiracy theory and implementing it as public health policy.  He’s not even trying to listen to decades of research by people who are the most qualified in their fields,Lostsock1995,2025-04-25T01:21:43,3
"Sorry for a second comment, but I can't help myself after reading it aloud.  Language of that release is breathtakingly unprofessional. ""Unlike the previous administration,  which wasted  billions dollars on a virtue signaling and ineffective grifts,,,""  "" 'no 'Green New Scam' "" ?!  Has any administration ever released an announcement with such immature grievance-speak?",spamattacker,2025-04-24T19:49:35,21

"If young adults  believe this, I am sad to see how little the attempts of our public schools to help students develop critical thinking skills.   That started well over 25 years ago, and I know the since then, they've tried to teach net-savy critical reding skills",spamattacker,2025-04-24T19:34:06,3
The only difference I can see between the White House statements and Trump’s “TruthSocial” posts is the fact that he has an editor clean up the punctation and capitalization for the governmental site….,Tart-Pomgranate5743,2025-04-25T10:08:15,2
"It’s hard to even process how psychotic it is for an anti-vaxer to head the dept of health. Vaccines are probably the second greatest innovation in modern medicine, topped by only sterilization/disinfectants. They are literally the safest and most effective medical procedures that exist. RFK was alive when millions of children were dying or made paralyzed by Polio. Even if vaccines did cause autism, which they definitely don’t, I’ll take autism over polio. Thanks",SadBoyStev3,2025-04-25T05:18:36,3
"It’s like when you can tell someone just learned a new word and they start using it constantly even when it doesn’t fit. Some of Trumps new words are “grift” and “insurrection.”  No but really, he is specifically using words that have been used to describe his own actions and is starting to misapply them so that it devalues their meaning to his base (to the extent that his base ever knew those words in the first place, which given their average reading level I am doubtful of)",dogmotherhood,2025-04-24T20:40:55,7
