"Pam Bondi's resume includes    - lobbying for Qatar, a country which tolerates slavery among many other human rights violations   - convincing people during Trump's impeachment that the process itself was illegitimate, no such thing as checks and balances when republican is king   - coordinating a lot of the less violent attempts to steal the 2020 election    This is an Attorney General who is firmly committed to ending law and order in this country. She is absolutely intent on arresting judges to eliminate them as a check on Republicans' radical revolution to end American democracy and turn us into an oligarchy.

"Pam Bondi and Kash Patel are in a whole lot of trouble.  They served an administrative warrant with which Judge Hannah Dugan did not have to comply.  Judge Dugan was well within her rights and could sue the both of them for false arrest.  I suspect the reason they did not have a proper warrant was that they were unable to get a judge to issue a warrant for a colleague.  The fourth amendment to the constitution protected Judge Dugan; in the same way it will protect anyone from ""illegal search and seizure.""  If someone comes knocking on your door, unless they have a warrant signed by a sitting judge, you can close your door and tell them to pound sand. Moreover, the guy was in the courtroom for a pretrial motion. There's no evidence that it was Dugan who told him to leave by the jury door.  So the evidence against her is thin, if not ""Trumped up"".  I think Bondi is in danger of losing her license...and her job as Attorney General.  She does not make law; Congress does.

Also take tariffs away from the president   - increase the size of the supreme court so that a few years of hyper-partisan politics can't stack the court with activist judges and completely shift the law - reestablish the fairness doctrine - severe campaign finance reform - implement a non-first-past-the-post voting system nationwide (Republican state legislatures are currently trying to outlaw this, as it is the only way to break up the two party system and their stranglehold on certain voting blocs which may not support them if there is a better way) - enforce laws that prevent religious institutions from incorporating politics into their service  Many other things, but this is a start.

Judges typically give the president a fuck ton of leeway because they are the president but I think we'll start seeing the true power of the Judicial branch.   Of course trump will push that and we'll head even further into a constitutional crisis. But more and more people in power are turning against him. Unfortunately he purged the entire Executive branch and installed all loyalists.   I think the 2026 mid terms are going to be a bloodbath with Dems winning in a landslide.

"Did you read the, I believe, recent interview in Time with the President where he discussed just that and so much more. If I thought he was inept before, this interview demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is unfit, completely delulu. After being read, quoted the 9-0 decision of the Supreme Court re/ Mr. Garcia, he replied that his ""lawyers"" didn't see it that way. So his lawyers supercede a unanimous decision by the highest court in the United States. WTF? And there was so much more, they read most of it on Meidas Touch if anyone wonders where I heard this. He also said, tariff wise that he had deals with ""200 countries"" but refused to elaborate on a single one. As a Canadian, I have been following the descent of your government in to abject chaos and worse. Canadians don't hate Americans, we hate Trump, his party, MAGA and everything they represent. The mass protests in support of citizens and immigrants being rounded up and summarily deported to El Salvador without charge or due process show the real grass roots support these disappeared people have.

They may say that publicly but I don't believe it. They are well aware of their actions being out of bounds but I think they are making a gamble: Go for it and possibly cement power forever or be on the negative side of an aging and ever shrinking constituency thus getting politically destroyed.  I think its a mistake to use the old calculus that the GOP will be harsh if they return to power because that's partially why we are here. Going hard at Trump and the GOP for Jan 6th was shelved or postponed largely because of that mindset imo. Its high time we did something different.

"> If Dems are ever in power again there will absolutely be an appetite for revenge in the base, and it will be justified because MAGA is actually breaking the law. But then if republicans are ever in power again it will just be this times 100 for the same reasons.   I agree with other commenters in that there *must* be retribution, as laid out in the current legal system. It's no accident, though, that republicans are claiming to simply being treating dems the way they've been treated themselves. They do this so that, when laws finally catch up, they can turn themselves into martyrs and have their followers try to bail them out.   As an example, just look at france with Le Pen. Her embezzlement has been known and widely discussed for a decade, as have the likely penalties, but she's declaring that she personally, and the right generally, are actually victims of political persecution. Worse, many people appear to be taking it seriously and there appears to be some nervousness in French politics about this.",Nemisis_the_2nd,2025-04-25T19:17:38,2

So roughly 1 out of every 13 people believed the government needed to be violently removed from power and were willing to do so themselves.

I’m well aware that if all you consume is Fox News, it would warp most minds.  The difference is that I wanted to believe that these people deep down actually care about things like corruption. Because while I vote Democrat, if you don’t think the entire DNC is filled with corruption you’re blind. They aren’t wrong for calling it out.  They are wrong for not calling it out on their side. The left does call it out on the democratic side. That’s what tells you that they don’t actually care about corruption, and they never did.  For them, for the voters, calling out corruption isn’t about “draining the swamp”. It’s about attacking a weakness in their enemies. It’s one thing for the manipulators to do that, it’s another for the manipulated.   That’s why I won’t ever engage them about politics anymore. On any issue, there’s no point. Other liberals waste their time arguing with them  about immigration, corruption, the economy, trans rights.  It’s useless because they don’t care. They don’t believe in their position.

How expensive are things, their retirement plans, etc. issues close to home. And I won’t talk about it politically. The moment you do is the moment every word out of your mouth is an attack to them.  My issue is that people on the left have spent the last 9 years arguing with them, and that only drives people away. No one is convinced to switch sides like that. And if you aren’t trying to change their minds, how do you think you’re helping a system dependent on voting numbers?  And my issue is that I believed you could get them to call out the things they claim they hate on their side eventually.

">33. After leaving the Chief Judge’s vestibule and returning to the public hallway, **DEA Agent A reported that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney were in the public hallway. DEA Agent B also observed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the hallway near Courtroom 615** and noted that Flores- Ruiz was looking around the hallway. From different vantage points, both agents observed Flores- Ruiz and his counsel walk briskly towards the elevator bank on the south end of the sixth floor. I am familiar with the layout of the sixth floor of the courthouse and know that the south elevators are not the closest elevators to Courtroom 615, and therefore it appears that Flores-Ruiz and his counsel elected not to use the closest elevator bank to Courtroom 615. **DEA Agent A followed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney towards the south elevator bank. At approximately 8:50 a.m., DEA Agent A alerted other members of the arrest team that DEA Agent A was on the elevator with Flores-Ruiz.** While on the elevator, Flores-Ruiz and his attorney spoke to each other in Spanish, which DEA Agent A did not understand. **They exited the elevator on one of the bottom floors of the courthouse and used the Ninth Street public entrance/exit to leave the building.**     https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69943125/1/united-states-v-dugan/  Two agents are seeing him in the public hallway, including DEA Agent B that was standing outside of Courtroom 615 the whole time.",washingtonu,2025-04-26T15:59:19,1

Every single ""capitalist"" country that hasn't fallen to fascism is either in the process, or have such strong social institutions that calling them a capitalist nation feels reductive.   Also Capitalism is on paper just a mode of production but in practice becomes practically a religion for the societies that embrace it.

"I don’t think we disagree except on the point of whether or not federal courts (including SCOTUS) holding the administration in contempt will matter.   Now states may be able to get creative, but a federal judge will be reliant on the cooperation of the administration to have their contempt orders upheld. Unless they get really creative and appoint a special prosecutor or directly order banks to freeze personal assets bypassing the DOJ. But even then I’m not sure they’d get very far against an actively hostile executive branch. Especially if the contempt rulings ordered prison time to enforce compliance. The DOJ could simply refuse to imprison their own personnel since they run the federal prisons.   State judges have different bureaucratic tools and enforcement arms available to them to enforce contempt rulings. But even then at some point the DOJ can step in and strong arm state and local law enforcement.   Either way it’s dangerous territory and my bet is that federal judges won’t want to reveal their lack of direct enforcement power or risk arrest and prosecution by an actively hostile DOJ. So I expect to see civil contempt rulings without sanctions attached.  Edit: not an attorney.
