">Homeland Security Advisor Stephen Miller said that the administration will be “coordinating with state and local law enforcement to fight child abuse in our school system.” Child abuse in schools is already illegal, so he explained that the administration wants state and local authorities to prosecute cases where teachers turn kids trans as child abuse, even though that is not happening in schools.  >Conservatives haven’t come up with any cases of this happening. [Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) once claimed](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/04/ron-desantis-busted-lying-trans-kids-family-support-dont-say-gay-law/) that a school had turned a kid transgender behind their parents’ backs, but local reporters found that the parents had actually been emailing with the school and encouraged the school to apply its transgender student policy to their child.  >“This gender situation has thrown us for a loop. I sincerely appreciate your support. I’m going to let her take the lead on this,” the mother emailed the school before her family’s story got attention on rightwing media.  Fuck Christian nationalism.      In a country where there is already an extreme teacher shortage, now they are going to attack teachers and lock up teachers for being kind to all students, aka doing what teachers are supposed to do.     That is ridiculous. Fuck them, fuck Stephen Miller, and fuck everyone who would rather see trans kids die than love them as they are.",southpawFA,2025-05-01T15:45:02,43
As wild as this shit is it's working. I just got off the phone with one of the lawyers for one of the Pride committees I'm on. Our Pride event is basically canceled because the town business council isn't interested in giving us anything we would need to have an event.

"Just a reminder that the Nazis started with transgender people too, even if you never here about it.  https://magnus-hirschfeld.de/ausstellungen/institute/  The Institute for Sexual Science was medical research center in Berlin that studied Gender and sexuality. They were performing hormone treatments all the way back then and performed some of the world's first gender reassignment surgeries.  One of the Nazis first actions was to raid the Institute and destroy their records.  The pink triangle wasn't just for gay men.  And this won't stop with trans kids here either. Multiple states are already trying to overturn same sex marriage. And the justice department just ended a school segregation order in Louisiana.  Trans people are such an extreme minority that they serve a purpose for Fascist regimes. There are so few that are willing to speak up for them, that it starts the process of normalizing genocide. The targets will expand outward.",Calderis,2025-05-01T21:33:30,4
