"Spending has increased in the last three months, not decreased.  DOGE spent too much time with tech dudes looking around in computers for things they didn't understand, and cut whatever looked good, when a team of forensic accountants could have gone through the budget looking for actual fraud, waste, and abuse.  Tech guys are smart in their field, but they don't have the skill set to find equally clever people stealing money, any more than a brain surgeon could.  It also didn't help that many of the cuts seemed conveniently targeted at things that affected Musk's personal businesses.  I'm all for cutting.  But DOGE was not the way to go about it.  I want an army of accounting nerds with pocket protectors and calculators looking at every cent spent, digging into every corner of the budget.  I'm talking about the people who look into Wall Street conmen.",cathbadh,2025-04-29T10:06:51,683
"I get that we need Congress to make some hard choices more than anything else and that at the end of the day, this is on them, but boy does this feel disappointing this far given what was said by Elon and others about what they expected to accomplish with this thing.",deadzip10,2025-04-29T07:14:25,510
"This comment totally sums up why Silicon Valley sucks so much. Every startup “founder” is a tech bro with a god complex who thinks they can use “tech” to solve problems they do not fully understand.   I agree completely. The *concept* of DOGE is good, but turning it into a tech bro ego-building  tool was moronic. At the end of the day, the reality is that 2/3 of our federal budget goes to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Half of what remains goes to defense. There will be no meaningful reductions in spending until the government recognizes that the elderly of today live way longer and cost exponentially more to keep alive than they did when these programs were enacted, and they didn’t have enough kids to support the kind of extended retirement and unlimited, free healthcare they want. If the government was serious about cutting costs, Medicare would stop covering anything other than Tylenol and morphine when you turn 75.",smp501,2025-04-29T18:31:13,42

"It still cut a lot of the fat.   People who thought DOGE was magically gonna find a trillion dollars in the couch cushions haven’t been paying attention.  You want to stop the deficit ? Cut the military budget, make social security actually money solvent instead of deficit, cut entitlements like Medicare and Medicaid, and find ways to boost and grow the middle class.   Currently my generation is going to have pay for the mistakes of the previous generation being completely frivolous and to say that I’m not outwardly spiteful would be very inaccurate.   “A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in”. Certainly feels like they took all the fruit and trees and said it’s not our problem or won’t be a problem.",Derp2638,2025-04-29T06:43:36,-56

"Sounds like they got stone-walled on their military probe.

Doesn't help that activist judges are ready to pounce on everything and slow it up.  155b is not much so far but think about the long term effects. That will be more meaningful.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T08:38:32,-44
"But even if we had ""accounting nerds"" you have to assume they would still threaten the wallets of nasty actors that didn't want to lose money, encountering the same resistance that DOGE did. We saw what happened with Project Veritas when they challenged big pharma, O'Keefe had to go indie. You could hire ex-IRS bulldogs and they'd still be stone-walled by the Military Industrial Complex or the Big Pharma industry, hiding behind headlines of ""they're cutting medicaid and defense!"" with fake conservatives here eating it up.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-29T10:23:31,-33

How is Medicare an entitlement when I worked and paid into it for 50 years?,bulldog522002,2025-04-29T09:00:47,391
"It’s too bad congress is such shit. Reforms should have been done 20 years ago. Now without reforms to Social Security and Medicare, automatic cuts will eventually kick in.   The Social Security trust fund will be insolvent in about 10 years, when that happens, benefits will be cut about 20-25% automatically. Medicare Part A has something similar.  A ticking time bomb benefits Democrats, which IMO is why they demonize Republicans who have proposed some changes. When automatic cuts are threatened, Democrats will propose increasing the cap, or means test. Any real reform that involves cuts won’t be politically viable, or minor reforms like changes to COLA will be pinned on Republicans.  It will likely be a bandaid that buys us time.  For as many problems Bush had, his proposal to have a 401k/Social Security hybrid would have been such a great option.",RotoDog,2025-04-29T07:58:08,58

Yeah ultimately people on both sides don’t want to admit that the government has simply committed itself to spending vastly more money than it can raise through taxation.  You can and should trim the waste and grift around the edges but even if the system is leaned out to run exactly as congressional budgets intend it’s still a gargantuan deficit.,Lithuim,2025-04-29T09:26:51,87

It's an entitlement because you are entitled to it,FunkyMonkss,2025-04-29T13:41:37,31
"Because you didn't pay into your own Medicare account. You paid into the accounts of the older generation, just as your current account is being paid into by the younger.",DatTrumpDoh,2025-04-29T09:32:38,-73
"Because it's a ponzi scheme.  You are paying for the people currently receiving benefits.  You need someone else to come in behind and pay for you.  Which means you effectively need infinite growth to make it sustainable.  And given current birthrates, that's never happening.    This isn't unique to Medicare.  Pretty much every pension entitlement program is the exact same way.  The people currently paying into the system are funding the people currently getting on the dole.  Now you see why so much of the Establishment in western nations are allowing unfiltered migration into the countries.  They are desperate to get more bodies to continue paying into the system or else the whole house of cards comes crashing down.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-29T10:47:11,-27

The thing I've been most heavily downvoted for is questioning the Russia/Ukraine narrative. They REALLY don't want to give up on their last chance to kick off WWIII / the next forever war.  ETA: this comment vs my one above it as a good case in point.

Which is why it actually is similar to a ponzi scheme.   You'd be better off putting that same money into a roth Ira every pay check. SS and Medicare should be reformed entirely but there's no way of really doing it without scaring people and possibly undercutting an entire generation. Or so politicians tell you.   If everyone under a certain age got tax returns based on what was paid before and everyone over a certain age got grandfathered into the current system and tax money was shifted to cover the one generation gap (a smaller generation than the boomers anyway) it would be able to be reformed with minimal damage in one generation.,duckfruits,2025-04-29T10:09:52,-27

 But isn't all insurance similar to ponzi schemes ?,bulldog522002,2025-04-29T10:51:31,125
I see you are a part of the me generation. Like I said I worked and paid into Social Security and Medicare for over 50 years. It made me feel good to see my parents and grandparents taken care of. If it hadn't been for these programs I guess they would have to sell everything they worked for. Or me and my siblings would have had to try to care for them while raising a family of our own. Is that your idea of fairness?,bulldog522002,2025-04-29T14:53:18,32
"No, an insurance company is basically just a super conservative investment bank, if an insurance company manages its money well it will never run out as long as there aren't too many disasters at the same time that cause it to need to dip into the principle. Insurance companies pay out of their dividends/returns not from the money you give them.   Medicare, SS, unemployment never got the opportunity to grow an investment, they immediately started collecting and disbursing that money, the ""investment"" was ""population size always go up"", well the boomers had half as many kids as their parents, and gen-x fewer kids than their parents, and so on. So the investment went south pretty quickly and instead of coming up with a fix when they realized this 60 years ago, they instead buried their heads in the sand and turned it into a ponzi scheme (which is often how ponzi schemes start - the investor's thesis fails and he's too embarrassed to admit it so he lies). Now we're sitting here after the longest con in the history of america and no one wants to be left holding the bag or even suggesting that there's a problem.",Grizknot,2025-04-30T08:23:30,1
