">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to fight everywhere and all at once,‚Äù he told the group of Democratic activists, officials and donors, who jumped to their feet with hoots and applause. ‚ÄúNever before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.

"These people are out of their minds. They don't care about America. They don't care about you or me. If we don't agree with him 100%, we're less than human in their eyes.   It's pretty bad. Even though the president really hasn't done anything wrong. If they just turned their freaking internet off for a week they would have nothing to complain about.   All the Democratic party runs on is ""this could happen"" And it's always wrong.   Imagine if these hateful people cared about others and just put some time in into making their part of the country a nice place. Being friendly to their neighbors. Spent the time protesting on volunteering somewhere.   They are selfish, ignorant pieces of shit in my opinion. And I don't say that lightly. I hate calling people names.",Jumpy-Program9957,2025-04-28T15:32:26,38

"What is you actually lead with a substantive alternative and actionable vision of what a better America could look like and actually, you know, tried leading? It would work so much better than just railing on about Trump all the time.  I swear they have learned *nothing* from the last election and just seem to be doubling down on their failure.  >¬†Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.  *Mass protests*, awesome. More protests in America is almost always good. Agree or disagree, I love people being passionate about their country. We have a right to protest for a reason.  *Mobilization* and *disruption* sound like thinly veiled dog whistle code words for (militant) mobilization and (societal) disruption. Is this an actual call to violence?  Not being rhetorical. This sounds like an *actual call for escalation to physical violence* and *attacks against one‚Äôs own country and countrymen* ‚Äî especially how it‚Äôs framed as being so exceptional and ‚Äúnever before have I asked.‚Äù  Calling for actual violence is in fact *treason* for a public official.¬†  At minimum this deserves clarification and an explanation.",Blarghnog,2025-04-28T19:15:36,2
