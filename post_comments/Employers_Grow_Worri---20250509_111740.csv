posting about how you are affected by the abuses you voted to inflict on others is not going to make me have sympathy for you. It just makes me think you’re an even bigger asshole than I realized.,sylbug,2025-05-09T11:28:38,13
Fliorida’s solution to the problem….  The Florida House advanced a desantis backed bill that would have “permitted 16- and 17-year-olds to work overnight on school days and work longer than an eight-hour day before a school day. Some 14- and 15-year-olds would also have been allowed to work those hours. It would also have scrapped required 30-minute meal breaks.”  Fortunately the Senate scrapped the bill.  https://www.newsweek.com/florida-plan-replace-migrant-workers-children-falls-apart-2068584,quest814,2025-05-09T12:06:33,9
"Yes, I can imagine so many illegal immigrants work white collar jobs. /s  Here's what will happen. Everyone will end up poorer and in shittier jobs than they currently work because of layoffs and business closures, thanks to Trump ruining the economy.
