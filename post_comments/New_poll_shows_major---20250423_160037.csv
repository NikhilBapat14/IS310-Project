The people democrats need to think about are the people who didn't vote. There are millions of them and they are the key to defeating this conservative movement. People voting conservative will not change their opinions over anything Trump does. Many of them don't even think it's possible.

"I think this is true to some degree. If you look at Bill Clinton and Obama, they gave their audience a feeling of hope. Trump actually does too since most Trump supporters say that he gives them a sense of hope, while far less Kamala voters said the same about her.      Bill Clinton and Obama both knew what the people's biggest concerns were: the economy, the deficit, inflation, and unemployment. They both made people feel like they understood their problems, and then they convinced people that they knew how to turn it around. Bill Clinton was a master at convincing people he knew what to do, and that his policies were proven to work. He made everything he did sound like common sense. He also wasn't afraid to call out Bush, and made him look like he was a do-nothing president.   But he constantly gave off a sense of optimism, and assured people to vote for him to create prosperity like they hadn't seen in a long time.      Obama was also good at convincing people that he knew how to fix our problems, but kind of differently than Bill. He said he'd create jobs, fix our healthcare system, switch back to American oil, and not take money from lobbies or secret actors. He made people believe he'd actually listen to and work for them. Where Obama was better than anybody so far is **ground game**. He had way more volunteers on the ground going door to door, visiting colleges, and posted on street corners. They handed out ""Hope"" and ""Yes We Can"" stickers and buttons all over college campuses. This is part of how he won the younger crowd. He also had his own version of a Snopes page to combat lies, which would have been crucial for Biden and Harris.      If Democrats want the White House back, they need somebody who makes people feel hopeful, and like they care about their struggles, while Vance or whoever doesn't even pretend to. They need a better ground game than Biden and Harris had, and they could borrow a couple ideas from Obama. Their campaign should look more grass roots, and have a wide network of volunteers. Talk to the elderly about what they want to hear about, and talk to young people about what they want to hear about. Young people aren't as concerned about Social Security or Medicare, and the elderly aren't as concerned about abortion or free college tuition/trade school.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-23T19:44:35,4

"No they didn't. Polling showed Trump had a strong hold on Gen Z males, and his campaign was pretty open about the fact that young men was one of the key demos they were targeting. In fact, there were jokes all over Reddit about how they be skipping the vote to play the Call of Duty game that was being released that day and hedging your bets on young men is a losing strategy given how they routinely rank at the top of low-frequency voters.  Even then, I think Trump actually underperformed with that age group compared to what the polling was predicting.  I have no idea where you're getting these ""old polls"" from. But, I mean, the thing about polling is that it's not static.

Im still not convinced there was this huge ideological shift among young white people. There was absolutely a shift right but it was a 4% shift from 2020 according to exit polls. Not exactly the demographic collapse you’d expect by the way people talk about it.   We just saw Wisconsin go from an even party registration split in 2024 to a D+7 turnout earlier this month. Turnout among young people dropped from 50% to 47% from 2020 to 2024. I don’t have the data to back this up but i wouldn’t be surprised if young left voters staying home made up a bigger chunk of that 4% shift than votes changing from D to R.

"Yeah this gets talked about like young men suddenly overwhelmingly shifted right in massive numbers.  I still find it concerning that there was any shift rightward, but I think more of it is that Trump and  Trumpism has mobilized a segment of shithead, low information voters who otherwise were politically disengaged from either major party.  These people and attitudes existed before Trump.  He just helped them coalesce into a political identity.

I learned WHY they were saying what they were saying and now I don’t take offense to shit like “All men are evil.” It’s literally a self fulfilling prophecy for young men that stay in their bubble surrounded by this type of content, they hear that women think men are evil, refuse to talk to women as people, and then feel angry that women don’t like them.

"To be a little fair, boomers held Jim Crow and other racist tendencies based on where they grew up. Unlike younger maga, unless they grew out of it, they are set in their ways. For example, my former best friend from high school didn't have a good relationship with his father, even though his father was around. Because he hated learning as his father was strict about schoolwork, he didn't care for it after being stationed in the Midwest and was persuaded by conservative Christianity. His father had the best intentions but was super stubborn. His father was slightly conservative, although I didn't know to what extent. My friend was looking for that father figure that nurtured him, and accidentally found it in what is now MAGA. Hence why MAGA goes after young men because a lot of them today are raised by single parent households, mostly by mothers with no father figure. As someone who was raised by one, I can tell you I nearly fell down that hole, but was fortunate enough to have someone else step into a fatherly figure to help avoid falling into MAGA.   Don't underestimate them exploring this. Even in two parent households, if the father isn't paying attention to the boy and instead repeats the ways of the past, we'll keep getting maga.

I think this describes how i feel about it pretty well. I’d like to add that i believe there’s a resentment among young men. Many believe they were robbed of their late teens/early 20s by Covid. I saw young men in my life turn to the Republicans because they blamed the democrats for the mask mandates and vaccine requirements. Barstool sports and the like did a great job of capitalizing on this feeling among young white men even though it’s misplaced blame.    I don’t think i can say the same about the Latino shift. That was a 14 point shift towards republicans so that shift is absolutely an ideological one. I’m more scared of that trend than the young men.,LilytheFire,2025-04-23T19:43:05,20

"The latino shift is sort of mind boggling tp me but I have some thoughts as a very left leaning latino man (with the caveat that I'm a no sabo kid, and am almost white passing, almost, I get some ""where are you from?"" comments from the angelos).  1.  Just straight up sexism.  There is still a lot of machismo culture in a lot of Latin communities in the U.S. and unfortunately that translated to just not voting for the woman candidate.   2.  I think very broadly, there are a lot of parts of the Latin population in the U.S. that are in a stage of aspiring assimilation.  There is a desire to be seen as separate from the recent immigrant population and more aligned with what is perceived as the ""default""  aka white population.  I hope people are paying attention to how dangerous thier gambit to be brought into the ""in-group"" is.  They deporting and arresting people for looking Mexican.   This ain't ok.

"Machismo is a very strong force. I am convinced the main factor in the 2024 shift was gender. Kamala probably would have won if she was male.   That trend is not set in stone. For example, California was a largely red state in the 1990s. In 1994, the state cracked down hard on immigrants, and the Republican Party still hasn’t recovered. Trump is alienating a lot of current and future voters every day. The MAGA movement also has no successor and nobody else who can inspire the same level of enthusiasm and turnout. A lot of non-Trump Republicans lost statewide races that Trump won on the same day.   If Democrats have a legitimate primary, they have a good chance of nominating a winnable candidate. It will probably have to be a male for the foreseeable future though.",Conscious-Coyote9839,2025-04-23T21:19:45,10
