Makes perfect sense. Trump promised to half our energy bills within his first year. Who needs to worry about energy efficient appliances when the cost of energy will be so low?

">Jesus fucking christ why.  Honest answer?¬†  1) Because it‚Äôs easier for politicians to slay imaginary dragons than it is to actually govern.¬†  2) The public are disinterested idiots with the attention span of goldfish.¬†  Climate change, a lack of affordable health care, gun violence, etc. These are all complex multifaceted issues that require a high level of of study and understanding to begin to address.¬†  Republicans don‚Äôt have the grey matter to understand the problems and craft solutions. And their constituents are morons who want WWE-style entertainment in politics.  So the Republicans tilt at windmills, the public goes to Facebook to learn what they should be angry about today, and both groups farm out actual policy to nefarious oligarchs and special interest groups because ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that.

"Some companies just turn down the power or water usage without trying to make them as good as before.  When low-flush toilets were first introduced a lot of companies just added blocks to the inside of the tank to drop the amount of water per flush, but didn't re-design the bowl to better use the lower amount of water, resulting in people complaining that low flow toilets were bad at flushing. Which some definitely were.  When I upgraded my toilets I saw some videos of the company flushing various things (marbles, hot dogs, giant wads of toilet paper, etc) to prove how good their flushing power was. Haven't had an issue except when the kids try to flush paper towel.",jabrwock1,2025-05-06T12:43:29,3
