"Side note regarding international sports:  The Winter Olympics are coming up in February, in Italy I believe.  Most of the Russian team is still banned and the rest of the world hates us, so do you think there is a chance Tr\*mp boycotts?  More than that, would he send them, wait for the first time our anthem gets booed, and then order them home.  That would cause a massive scene and completely take away from The Games themselves, which he would love more than anything.

"He‚Äôs a fake. This shit is all a show for his hardline, heehaw, MAGA muppets. He‚Äôs an educated man. He didn‚Äôt talk like this a few years ago. A person doesn‚Äôt change their entire personality like this unless they‚Äôve either had a brain injury (like my senator, John Fetterman) or it becomes more advantageous to act differently. In his case, worshipping at the MAGA altar (after having called Trump ‚ÄúHitler‚Äù just a few years ago) has become more profitable.  In private, I have no doubt Vance is still the person he was prior to being Trump‚Äôs kiss-ass lapdog. The man has mixed race children; I don‚Äôt believe for a second he suddenly hates brown people and immigrants (that certainly wasn‚Äôt his brand before). He‚Äôs just willing to throw *others* in those categories under the bus because he believes *his* people will be safe from this administration‚Äôs policies.  Everyone knows the day will eventually come when Trump is no longer president. Peter Thiel (Vance‚Äôs patron) and his buddies want it to be Vance. That‚Äôs why Vance changed his tune about Trump, and that‚Äôs why Thiel got him the VP job (just as he got him all of his recent jobs, including those in the private sector and his Senate seat).  What none of these clowns seem to understand is that Vance doesn‚Äôt have the personality to be Trump 2.0 for the MAGA muppets. It simply won‚Äôt be him.",dmetzcher,2025-05-07T11:52:45,2
