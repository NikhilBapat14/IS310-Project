"“May have”?   He either didn’t, and comments shouldn’t be made by Johnson, or he did, and the entire weight of all applicable government bodies should be brought down on him.    I HATE all these stories about “may have done” or “going to do”.   Figure it out and DO something about it.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-04-13T19:36:10,84
I had my life ruined by the covid vaccine so I really hope the Trump administration investigates.,kaytin911,2025-04-13T19:07:52,12
"Does this surprise anyone?  At this point there's more than enough evidence that several high ranking officials should be at LEAST investigated as directly, objectively lying to the nation about COVID side effects, and enough empirical SCIENTIFIC evidence of major issues with the vaccines outside of the reported data that maybe, just MAYBE we should be more directly investigating these issues...  but instead doctors and researchers are literally deleting data in an effort to appease the COVID proteolyzers that should have been watching this crap",bionic80,2025-04-13T19:09:15,4

I don't know why the losers are downvoting you.   The vaccine caused a lot of harm to a lot of people.   No wonder Pfizer asked the FDA to suppress their clinical data for the next 75 years.,Ironman650,2025-04-13T19:22:35,16
Leftist authoritarians still worship authority and deny that people like me exist.,kaytin911,2025-04-13T19:27:38,11
"> I don't know why the losers are downvoting you  They literally have nothing else to do with their time, so they **seethe** on this subreddit all day and night, it's hilarious 😂",37-19,2025-04-13T20:51:52,10
"I've had two healthy coworkers who had to get the jab (people in their 20s and 30s) have literal heart attacks and a partial aneurism after getting the jab three times.  I'm sorry I'm willing to say that the covid shot for the very VERY high risk people was needed, and scaled back to a single shot if that... but the quad jabbing ""boost it til you lose it"" is killing people and NO ONE IS WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT WHO CAN MAKE THE PROPER CHANGES NEEDED.",bionic80,2025-04-13T19:44:56,-6
"I remember watching a multicolored hair leftist say that she got the vaccine and was vaccine injured, but said that she would get the second one in a few months after she healed. I honestly feel bad for people so deluded that they harm themselves and others over political dogma.",sowellpatrol,2025-04-13T21:36:06,6

"I’ve heard many of these stories and they are true, people are in denial if they don’t believe it, the only thing people here can do is to downvote you hoping that helps, morons, fools, the problem remains whether they downvote or upvote!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-14T05:46:03,4
"Can you imagine people being so incredibly stupid, that not only are they still calling it a vaccine after receiving 4 or 5 shots, but that they still got infected with the virus that they  have been repeatedly vaccinated against, and then they  think that is totally normal.",Ironman650,2025-04-13T19:57:21,4

you are vastly understating it.  It was an absolute real world test of how to completely subvert the population,Slartibartfastthe2nd,2025-04-13T20:05:18,0
