How will this affect the First Felon's imports of red hats and all the other garbage he peddles that are made in China? Will he circumvent the tarrifs by having one of his cabinet members smuggle them into the country? Will red hats now cost $50? How much will the costumes his followers wear increase? Where will we buy the American flags that are made in China?,Maoleficent,2025-05-03T11:32:40,3

"This tracks-he's always looking out for #1. Steve Miller, chief of staff for evil, and rump said American children will have to get by receiving 1 doll instead of 30. They are so unbelievably out of touch. People are not worried about dolls, they are concerned about putting food on the table. This also explains rump's explaining to the masses that groceries are things you put into a bag. He finds it quaint.",Maoleficent,2025-05-03T13:14:05,2
