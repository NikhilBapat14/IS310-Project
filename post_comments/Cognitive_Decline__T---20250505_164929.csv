"The price tag of retrofitting Alcatraz into a functional prison would easily pay for a dozen or more high security prisons.  The *entire* facility would have to be demolished and removed with something else built in its place; the main jail only had a 300 prisoner capacity at its peak.  Most of the structures on the island are structurally unstable and condemned, and large portions of the main cell blocks are not far behind.    Nobody ever escaped, sure, and that was because of its location‚Ä¶but that‚Äôs just not necessary anymore because of the plethora of advanced security systems installed in modern prisons.  Even then, nobody ever escapes from prison anymore, at least not for long.  They might get out for a few hours or days, but it‚Äôs too hard to disappear and has been for a couple decades.    Reopening Alcatraz would be like buying a brand new car with the sole purpose of charging your phone.

"*""stwutting j-joe!!!""*  Get real. Joe had a non-mental stutter since he was a toddler. Not every manifestation of a variation is a symptom of a disease, and not all symptoms point to the same disease. They teach this in baby bio. Syphilis can present as almost anything, so it's important to get a blood test to confirm. You may even need another blood test. Humble yourself before the complexities of biochemistry as everything isn't what it seems.   Trump clearly has marked symptoms of dementia and cognitive decline since 2023, yet even as someone who's comfortable diagnosing mental illnesses, I can't safely diagnose him; although I can say there is a temporal difference that wasn't there before.",happyfundtimes,2025-05-05T17:19:46,20
