"Just another “fuck you, veterans” moment from a he coward-in-chief, Mr Bone Spurs.  I wonder how many Republican politicians who are military vets will stand up and object to another slap in the face.  Ah, who are we kidding.  Takes a spine to stand up.",CalRipkenForCommish,2025-05-02T05:29:28,29

I'm old enough to remember when [President Don John Trump Senior skipped out on a *Veterans Day* memorial service for US soldiers killed in France in WWI](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-cancels-ww1-memorial-at-us-cemetery-in-france-due-to-rain-idUSKCN1NF0NU/) because his cotton candy hair weave can't withstand a light drizzle.,C_MMENTARIAT,2025-05-02T05:37:17,23
Does Donald just wake up and brain storm ways to bother people each day? Because seriously I could think of ways to bother people all day and never even think about changing Veterans Day to just these specific Veterans Day.,ParappaTheWrapperr,2025-05-02T05:18:47,23

"> “We won both Wars, nobody was close to us in terms of strength, bravery, or military brilliance, but we never celebrate anything,” Trump wrote. “That’s because we don’t have leaders anymore, that know how to do so! We are going to start celebrating our victories again!   80% of Germany’s casualties were inflicted by the Soviet Union",bg370,2025-05-02T06:05:30,12

He's too stupid and self centered to understand a day that is to celebrate wounded or those who served - after all these are the people he refers to as 'losers' and 'suckers'.  I can just imagine him dreaming of a huge Nork or Russian military parade with him standing up on a balcony overlooking hundreds of thousands of subservient peasants while being saluted by the commanders of several hundred tanks driving by.  Little boyfriend next to him doing a nice special totally not nazi salute of course.   Genuine banana republic stuff.,-Kastagrar-,2025-05-02T06:53:20,4
