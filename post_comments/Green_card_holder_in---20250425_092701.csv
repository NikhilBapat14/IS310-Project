"By Mandy Taheri - Weekend Reporter:   Cliona Ward, a 54-year-old green card holder who has lived in the United States for more than four decades, was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at San Francisco International Airport on April 21 upon her delivery of requested documents, her sister Orla Holladay told Newsweek.  Holladay said thatWard's detention was triggered by her previous nearly 20-year old criminal record, which the family believes has been expunged. Newsweek has been unable to verify and confirm if both her federal and state record has been expunged.

My BIL is a naturalized citizen but travels internationally for work several times a month. It makes me sick to realize that someone having a bad day could just toss him in a cell.,Organic-Class-8537,2025-04-25T10:48:00,11
"""The officials brought up her six minor offences which stretch from 2003 to 2008 and detained her for two days. They released her after she told them her convictions been expunged and told her to get documentation and attend a meeting with customs officials in San Francisco last Monday.  However, when she turned up with the documents she was detained again and charged with moral turpitude.""  ...  including ""failure to notify DMV [Department of Motor Vehicles] of address change within 10 days”.""     So glad that the Republicans are focusing on these *hardened criminals* /s",Sweet-Advertising798,2025-04-27T21:21:25,2
"She wasn’t a U.S. citizen — your brother is. She held a green card and had a felony conviction for drug possession.   Drug possession alone makes a green card holder immediately deportable.   Although she was already eligible for deportation, what actually triggered it was her traveling internationally.   If she hadn’t traveled, she likely would have been fine, but drug possession is considered a very serious issue.   Under Trump, CBP has been given strict orders not to let anything slide.",moonlight_473832,2025-04-26T02:29:37,0
