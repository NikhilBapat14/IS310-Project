"So, now Blacklists are being used. The last time that was on a large organized scale was during McCarthyism under the red scare. Interesting, but under the Cold War, Russia was the enemy and it was about rounding up list of communist names that the studios and theaters wouldn’t hire or they’d all be added to the list and shows couldn’t open and movies wouldn’t be released.",Mike-ggg,2025-05-08T05:44:21,15

What was the last play President Lincoln saw?  Maybe that one’s good?  Or the emperors new clothes?  There has to be something Trump would like that could run?  Can someone put him in a room with a podcaster standup doing 2 hours on how stupid Biden is and just tell him it’s the Lincoln center he’s not classy or dementia free enough to know better.,Spare_Philosopher893,2025-05-08T04:55:59,8

"I know what you are implying... but...  Javert is not a villain, although he does play the role of an antagonist. He is rigid and lawful and while he has a strong moral compass, his inflexibility is his weakness. Trump and MAGA has no moral compass, is not lawful and they flexible by turning on anyone or any issue.   Javert sees the world as black and white where lawbreakers are bad and must be punished, regardless of their reasons or personal transformation. Trump only sees black and white in those that oppose him. Lawbreakers are only bad if it doesn't serve him. Trump isn't interested in justice. He is only interested in himeself.  Javert doesn't see himself as the main character. He sees justice as the main character. Trump's entire goal is to make himself the main character in everyone else's life.  What makes Javert compelling is that he isn't cruel or evil. He is actually sincere, disciplined, and even admirable in his commitment. However, his inability to reconcile Jean Valjean's genuine reformation with his belief in absolute justice makes hime a tragic character. When faced with the mercy and moral complexity of Valjean's character, Javert experiences a crisis he cannot resolve.  Javert is not Trump or MAGA. Javert is not a traditional villain but is an antangonist. Javert is a tragic figure that that is destroyed by his own moral absolutism.  The Thenardier's on the other hand...",16cards,2025-05-08T07:35:43,5

You have these companies who refuse to open a facility or do business in a state due to their tax rates or environmental laws and then you have these people who refuse to do business somewhere because of their very predatory industries that attack their competing entertainment products & people who operate there that cost them business and profit.,postsshortcomments,2025-05-08T07:36:56,1

"No, that's blackballing.  Black listing would be banning them from any performance at the Kennedy Centre, not just the one they are boycotting.",2much2Jung,2025-05-08T06:23:44,8
"See, but the consumer has a demand for artists who are against providing these distractions and disruptions that seem to be angering a very small group of politically well-connected individuals who have become very vocal and fervent about ""stopping it.""   Just like if you don't measure the COVID, if you don't air performances in DC which is a community full of very dysfunctional and very unhinged loons who run these firms that go off about all of this very weird symbolism and these spirals in these industries it's in the best interest for to make sure that these very strange political cults don't show up at your performance. Just look at all of the senseless and very strange in-organic political agendas surrounding some of these products. What performer acting in their own best interests would even want to be anywhere near being exposed to these very radical right-winger PACs and their very strange agendas that they send their very violent and aggressive supporters towards (just look at what they did the Bud Light!)   This is a city and a city with a culture who wants to be entertained by watching Mr. Man tell children to dig holes.",postsshortcomments,2025-05-08T07:06:27,2

"Yea. I don't think he realizes that the art community is chock full of antifascists and if other venues want to stay in business, they kind of need them. But, killing the arts is a fascist move and Trump and his fascists certainly aren't going to not try.",ItsSpaghettiLee2112,2025-05-08T06:56:01,10
"No. That would be banning them from their venue. Blacklisting is an industry-wide ban.  Edit: guys, blacklisting is an old term. It got popular during anti labor movements where bosses would fire you for attempting to unionize and they would tell other bosses so they wouldn't hire you.",ItsSpaghettiLee2112,2025-05-08T06:26:34,2
"You're both somewhat correct, in a sense.   *You're* correct about the meaning of blacklisting and the fact that this is an attempt to create a blacklist whereby people on the list do not get work, similar to the Hollywood blacklist of the 40s and 50s.   The other user is correct in that this policy, in practice, would essentially be just a ban from the Kennedy Center, which they are already boycotting. Ric Grenell is not an industry bigwig and so he can create as many lists as he likes but they're less likely to be effective than if he was actually part of the industry.",MarcusSurvives,2025-05-08T08:01:44,0
"There's direct language suggesting he wants to explicitly blacklist them and not simply ban them from the Kennedy Center.   >Ric Grenell, reacting Wednesday to headlines about cast members of Les Misérables who are planning to boycott President Donald Trump’s scheduled appearance next month, **demanded career-altering consequences** for “vapid and intolerant artists.”  ...  >“In fact, we think it would be important to out those vapid and intolerant artists **to ensure producers know who they shouldn’t hire** — and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience,"" he continued.",ItsSpaghettiLee2112,2025-05-08T08:30:24,1
"Again, you're accurate in describing their expression of intent, but the OP is not inaccurate in describing the likely impact.",MarcusSurvives,2025-05-08T10:19:29,1
"Ok but they weren't asking if they had the likely impact correct they were asking if they had the intent correct. That's why they used quotes, to imply that's what Kennedy Center guy was suggesting.",ItsSpaghettiLee2112,2025-05-08T10:22:51,-1
I think the user was illustrating the likely effect of this policy as a means to emphasize how toothless a measure like this would be.,MarcusSurvives,2025-05-08T11:03:10,3
