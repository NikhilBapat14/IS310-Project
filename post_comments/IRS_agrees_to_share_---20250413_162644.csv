"If an alien is deported, does that mean they can ask SSA to give them back any contributions ? It only seem fair as they are being denied the ability to work 40 quarters.",cosmicrae,2025-04-14T07:03:58,1
Yes. Undocumented immigrants contribute to near 100 billion in taxes every yearÂ ,bluegumgum,2025-04-13T16:46:13,9
"It's gonna be ""great"" (sarcasm intended)  * We deport a bunch of immigrants... hollowing out a bunch of jobs  * We also lose out on the $100 Billion or so in IRS income they contribute  * AND now the tariff flip-flops have prices going up and other countries turning their backs on us.. so not only will things get more expensive, but we'll have a harder time getting stuff and various revenue streams like tourism etc will dry up.   It's like a 7-layer idiocy cake.",jmnugent,2025-04-13T17:01:17,7
