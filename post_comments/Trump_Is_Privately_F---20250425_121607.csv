Freaking out Putin will release something?,NapOwl,2025-04-25T12:17:33,123
"There is no evidence provided in this article about Trump's emotional state.  At the end of the day, it doesn't matter.  He considers Putin to be a friend and a winner, while he dismisses Zelensky as a loser who should surrender and deserves to be humiliated.  Trump's idea of a peace deal is for Zelensky to give the Russians whatever they want.  Trump has the mindset of a mob boss who is making an offer that can't be refused, so he remains astonished that this Godfather movie shtick is not working.  Trump means it when he says that he believes that Zelensky ""doesn't have the cards"".  Might makes right, and the loser is supposed to lose with gratitude.  It never occurred to Trump that it might not go his way.",I405CA,2025-04-25T12:27:58,52
