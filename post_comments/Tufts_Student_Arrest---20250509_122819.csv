Freed or ordered to be freed? A pretty big difference in view of trump’s lawlessness.,ButchBulldog,2025-05-09T12:41:13,1
NYTimes says ordered but not freed yet. Hopefully they follow through. I suspect she'll have a lot to say.,AlfredRWallace,2025-05-09T14:16:39,1
"I'll believe it when she's actually free. Trump tends to ignore judges' orders.   I'm an ACLU member and the ACLU was the team defending her so I'm very proud of them if this is true.     I've been to seven protests and I've carried a sign about her to every one of them.   But I'm waiting to hear when she is actually free, not just **granted** freedom.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T15:38:09,1
"Now we just need the ""elected"" to respect the rule of laws, including judgments they don't agree with.        There was no mandate to disregard one of the three branches of government.",faith_apnea,2025-05-09T14:57:23,1
It’s almost like freedom of speech was enshrined in this nation’s constitution,jorgekrzyz,2025-05-09T16:12:41,1

It’s just the law. Why should following the law be a blow to anyone.,kingOofgames,2025-05-09T14:57:46,1

"I mean I don’t have a lot of sympathy when there’s bad faith actors here in America running up to progressive democrats during town halls and yelling at them about how bad their policies are but it takes trump posting a photo of the Gaza strip being turned into a Las Vegas casino strip 2.0 before I see any comment and even then it seems minor in the amount I see complaining about democrat policies. And I still see no one being pulled out of his cult meetings for doing the things they are doing in the town halls of democrats that I’ve seen.  Maybe I’m biased.   Hate to say that because I think it’s a really a terrible situation but we had a chance to reduce the damage potential and failed, it’s only going to get worse and we still have people seemingly only going after one side.",Teddy-Ruxs-Penis,2025-05-09T12:40:43,1
"This probably isn’t related, but fuck Tufts. One of the worst schools to deal with trying to verify education.",NoneOfThisMatters_XO,2025-05-09T12:41:33,1
"^ This. They ordered her release. Doesn’t mean the feds are actually going to do it, based on what we’ve seen so far.  24 hours from now they could be like “Oh, we already sent her to El Salvador, out of our hands now! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ “",Atticus248,2025-05-09T13:02:43,1

You don't have sympathy for kids getting arrested for speaking out against the actions of Trump's government for not uhh speaking out against Trump's government?,IShouldBWorkin,2025-05-09T13:13:16,1
"In your scramble to be very edgy, I think you missed that the op-ed in question was published in March 2024, long before Donald made his Vegas/Gaza Strip comments.

You are correct: it is not related to the subject matter of this discussion.,More_of_the-same-bs,2025-05-09T13:40:26,1
They've added more detail. She was freed but government deportation charges are allowed to continue. So fucked up.,AlfredRWallace,2025-05-09T14:56:01,1
Liberals hate the left more than they hate fascists. They picked a side and we just gotta move on from that era of Democratic politics without them.,FloppedTurtle,2025-05-09T13:47:12,1
Sure but I’d like ‘em out of government detention centers and outta the hands of any fat-fingered gestapo members,MilkyChongBop,2025-05-09T15:38:09,1
"That'll only happen if we fight for it. I think we need to get everyone disappeared by ICE released as soon as possible, and if that means we make enemies along the way, I'm comfortable with that.",FloppedTurtle,2025-05-09T15:51:23,1
