He is such an arrogant fool! 🙄,kh-38,2025-04-25T07:49:25,33
We have an absolute moron as president.   He's cunning and sly. As a grifter he can smell out fear and greed in others in order to pick his mark. But intelligence and curiosity?  No chance. Not when he believes he is the smartest guy in the room - and worse for us has a pattern of hiring people who make him feel really smart. Incompetent sycophants who flatter him.,SicilyMalta,2025-04-25T07:51:33,23

"No fucking shit...a dictator doesn't tend to stop when they start Mr ""ill end the war in 24 hours""   And now we have India and Pakistan threatening to end their ceasefire too...I guess by Trumps logic we can now say ""Oh Pakistan would have never attacked India if Kamala was in office""?? 🤡",blues111,2025-04-25T07:54:35,6
Who knew health care was so complicated,Choppergold,2025-04-25T08:25:27,4
I wonder how Ukraine is going to survive once Trump completely backs out which looks like what is going to happen. Ukraine is struggling with manpower.   Putin just gave Trump the middle finger even though the deal America put in gave everything for Russia and nothing for Ukraine.,PixelationIX,2025-04-25T07:50:20,6

"On the one hand, el oh fucking el.  On the other hand, as someone who is, in fact, a narcissist, this is understandable. His psychology is such that he genuinely does believe he is awesome and amazing enough that he can end global conflicts with a phone call, and probably also that he can break the rules of economics by somehow successfully utilizing tariffs, not to mention convincing himself to the point of self-soothing that clearly 100% of the American public will love him for everything he does. He is a fascinating case study of narcissism.",Nillavuh,2025-04-25T08:02:24,1
Funny how the news media suddenly doesn't care about convicted felon Trump's support  for Israel's extermination campaign on Gaza.  Incompetence has a way of drowning out issues that would take down a competent man.,ltcraft05,2025-04-25T08:03:10,1

The fact that he genuinely thought he would be the one to end the war with his “cards” and “deals” would be hilarious if it wasn’t drenched in overwhelming hubris and arrogance ,Alighieri-Dante,2025-04-25T08:34:25,1

"Ukraine isn't getting a lot of help from the US now.  They could get less, but I imagine it'll look a lot like it does now.  All this bullshit does is give Europe time to ramp up... which I really hope they're taking.",Deguilded,2025-04-25T07:53:05,7
