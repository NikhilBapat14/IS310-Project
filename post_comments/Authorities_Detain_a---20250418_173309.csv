"Due Process, non-citizens, and Good Friday  Excerpt:   Although Jesus of Nazareth technically had legal status to reside in Judea, he lacked protections from arbitrary punishments by the government.  Because he was raised in a working class, Jewish family in Galilee, he was not accorded the privileged legal protections of Roman citizens, and thus, he was not entitled to due process after his arrest, nor was he exempt from capital punishment after being declared guilty of treason by Gov. Pontius Pilate, despite a lack of evidence to support the charge.  The carpenter was publicly tortured by law enforcement for hours before being led through the city streets, past large crowds of bystanders, under the heavy weight of a wooden crucifix to a local site on a hill called Golgotha. There, he was nailed by the hands and feet to the crucifix and left to die by authorities.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-18T17:33:20,4
"I do not hold an open-borders view of immigration. Greater reproduction in many parts of the world, coupled with completely open borders, would significantly alter—and perhaps even shatter—our way of life in the United States.  But if we have granted immigrants legal status and protection, a shift in political climate should not be allowed to upend their lives. If deportation is warranted, it must follow due process, as the Supreme Court has affirmed. Deportation is drastic enough. But deportation followed by months, years, or even a lifetime in inhumane conditions—this, in my view, crosses way over the line into cruel and unusual punishment.  The modernized Gospel account shared here reframes the crucifixion of Jesus as a contemporary news story. It invites readers to reconsider the Passion not just as ancient religious history, but as a recurring tragedy: the state’s brutal exercise of power against the marginalized, the silencing of inconvenient truth-tellers, and the abandonment of the vulnerable under legal cover. This is not allegory.  In 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran father of three—two with special needs—was deported without due process, despite committing no crime and despite a prior court ruling protecting him from return to El Salvador. The Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act and sweeping deportation orders ignored that protection. Abrego was taken from his family and placed in a Salvadoran mega-prison, where he remains—silenced and cut off from legal recourse.  The government claimed he was a gang member. Perhaps. Perhaps not. As the Fourth Circuit Court wrote: ""Regardless, he is still entitled to due process."" Yet he received none.  The allegations rest on questionable sources: a tainted police report, the word of an informant tied to a disgraced detective, and a field interview form linking him to gang culture based on his clothing. Meanwhile, Abrego had built a stable life in Maryland—as a skilled sheet metal worker, university student, husband, and father. He had legal withholding of removal status due to well-founded fear of persecution. Yet suspicion—not proof—became the basis for his exile. His rights were denied. His voice erased.  His wife now says their autistic son searches the laundry to find his father’s shirts—just to smell them.  This is not just about one man. It is about a system that still finds it easier to crucify the powerless than to confront the political forces demanding a spectacle. Jesus said, “Whatever you do to the least of these, you do to me.” So we must ask: When we tear families apart, when we abandon justice in the name of national security, when we silence men like Kilmar—who are we really condemning?  The Passion story does not end at Golgotha. It echoes in every courtroom where evidence is ignored, in every ICE van that disappears a neighbor without warning, and in every cell where a man waits—not for trial, but for the world to remember he exists.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-19T10:52:57,3
