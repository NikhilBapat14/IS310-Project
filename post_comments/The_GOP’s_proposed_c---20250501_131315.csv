"It's not a paradox. People in red states are just dumb and vote against their own self interest. When they are all in medical debt and haven't recovered from a natural disaster that happened years ago, they will still blame the Dems.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-01T13:15:45,41
All of the states most dependant on the federal government want to destroy the federal government.  All of the worst performing economic areas in the United States are now determining the economic policy of the whole country. We are so fucked.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T13:16:31,12

"Y’all gotta stop thinking of the populations of states as cohesive entities.  Yes, there are millions of Trump voters who will find themselves in leopard territory. But there are perhaps even more who are financially comfortable in their low COLA areas, who don’t reasonably believe that they’ll ever need any help from these federal programs. They’re not going to be mad about their poor neighbors getting screwed.",teluetetime,2025-05-01T16:10:31,3

Not all are dumb. Some are evil. They WANT to see a Black or trans person suffering. Even if it means they don't have a county clinic anymore.,mental_dissonance,2025-05-01T13:22:45,26
"I’m tired of saving them from themselves. They don’t care until they’re personally affected, so it’s time they feel the consequences of their direct choices.",Punkinpry427,2025-05-01T14:08:38,9
"Peak irony for me is biden boosted red state jobs with ira act and chips act only to be cancelled. Often jobs in red/purple states or red districts in blue states.   Not only are the voters and those that did not vote dumb, so are their representatives. I fear empty shelves soon. We all rejoice “haha fuck them they deserve it” but its “fuck all of us this is fucked.”",oroechimaru,2025-05-01T18:34:37,3

They're either stupid or evil.  I usually give them the benefit of the doubt and label them stupid.,Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-01T13:47:50,11

"Not all of them are so focused on any particular group. They are low info voters, Trump was on their TV for years, they liked the show, and now like him as President. It's not that deep for a lot of them.",LocalStatistician538,2025-05-01T15:14:11,6
"Having talked to my share, I don't think they really think of it that way.  I think they just get way too hung up on this idea that someone who hasn't 'earned' something might get something.  They, of course, have EARNED the thing, because of all their ""Very unique"" and real circumstances, but it doesn't clock for them that, no, not everyone living on the streets is continuously coked out, no, that family on welfare isn't deliberately exploiting the system by having so many kids, and that kids on food stamps have birthdays too!  Assume the worst of everyone outside their insular little circle.  Now, the racists DO exist, it'd be ludicrous to claim otherwise, but the hard core ""I want to hurt black people ON PURPOSE"" racists don't account for electoral wins the way they once did.  Far more likely is the racist full of implicit prejudice who objects strongly to the idea that there could be any systematic holding people back.  When you discuss systematic racism, the response you get most often isn't ""Good"", it's ""Yeah, well where's my million dollar home for being white, huh?  Just because I'm white doesn't mean I have it easy!""  Ignorant of all the ways they DO have it easier than their own neighbors because of their skin.",aradraugfea,2025-05-01T19:02:50,1
"I'm right there with you, but my frustration is they are too stupid to see the correlation between their choices and their quality of life. It is always someone else's fault.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-01T14:37:01,7
"There’s plenty of large blue cities in southern red states (New Orleans, Houston, Austin, Atlanta, etc.). Lots of people who didn’t vote for this and gonna find even though they weren’t the ones who fucked around.",MelpomeneAndCalliope,2025-05-01T14:39:25,4
What kills me about the “where’s my million dollars if I’m privileged” that they always say that is they can’t comprehend the idea that their privilege is getting a fair shot at life.,Bruce-7891,2025-05-01T19:47:42,1
