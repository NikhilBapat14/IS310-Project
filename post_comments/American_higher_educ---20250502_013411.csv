If the president can do all this without congress then he too much power.,twitch_delta_blues,2025-05-02T02:35:59,47
"**TL;DR**: American higher education, long the world's envy, faces an existential crisis in 2025. A vengeful presidential administration targets universities, causing chaos—students, scholars, and programs suffer while elites scramble to protect endowments. Academic freedom—threatened by debt, censorship, and inequality—is at stake. Many consider leaving as global competitors rise. The choice: fight for reform or abandon a sinking ship.",pharrt,2025-05-02T01:37:30,20

“the once unsinkable ship of US higher education is suddenly making water.”  Umm… I believe the phrase is “taking on water.” “Making water” is… a different thing.,DoubleHurricane,2025-05-02T06:36:13,9
(Republicans) love the poorly educated.  They're much more easily influenced by propaganda outlets (ie. Fox News) who preach nonstop about what 'truth' they should believe and how vile the opposing political groups are. Almost as if someone were using 1984 as a playbook..,athornton79,2025-05-02T06:44:50,5

"Education is a privilege. Not a guaranteed right. It hasn’t even been mandatory for that long. The first education act was in 1852 in Massachusetts and it wasn’t until 1918 that all states finally had educational state law.  Here we are. Turns out educating the masses leads to free thinking and that conflicts with the current administrations ability to control the general public. We stand on the threshold of a new dark age. Historically when the church held the power of education they did not teach the masses how to read and write, they taught them only to fear God and obey their masters or rulers and they would all go to heaven . Cathedrals of Europe were adorned with paintings and tapestries of the atrocities of hell. You could ask the priest if you wanted to know more. An uneducated population is easier to control.",FireWaterSquaw,2025-05-02T02:13:10,-6

He has congress. Congress is controlled by Republicans and they are actively choosing not to resist when they easily could.,Deinosoar,2025-05-02T04:15:43,11
The US is in the sorry state it is because of ignorance of world governments.  The power you put on the President is only seen in Fascist regimes.  You have the oldest government in the world. These old men babble on with varying levels of dementia and they get elected until they get carried out in a box.  It was hilarious to see the arguments red and blue about Dementia Don and Sleepy Joe -they are both too old to run a country.,RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-02T10:07:08,0
Ugh. It’s ridiculous how every element of society is being warped to the will and sub-standards of this pos. This miscreant is weaponizing fed funding to enact revenge on every person and institution that slighted him in some way or other. He’s not governing. Just using the country’s resources as his personal assets to play god emperor.  His supporters’ kids will be making their living manufacturing small tchotchkes for the Chinese in a few decades. Or working overseas and sending remittances back the States. MAGA-Great Leap Backward 2025. ,Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-02T02:02:58,18
"Thanks for this summary. The headline is incredibly hyperbolic and it sounds like the article is as well. Universities will go on, its much to early to say they will collapse. much of the executive order stuff is going to play out in the courts.",ohilco8421,2025-05-02T08:56:26,0

"It’s focused on higher education. College is not for everyone. It used to be that young adults were taught a skill in highschool. In the 1990s schools started closing down the sheet metal , auto mechanic , wood working, farming  programs to name a few.  This led to a mass amount of unprepared people being pushed into furthering education in areas that simply do not have the demand. Side effect was the whole student loan movement because how else were they all going to keep up with the narrative?  I don’t agree with how they are dismantling the education system, I’m quite worried about personal freedoms and the sudden religious movement which spanks of ignorance . Let us hope that they bring back the programs that prepared people to make a living in this world.  There are enough college graduates not even working in their field of study. That system is already broken.",FireWaterSquaw,2025-05-02T05:11:15,-2
">It’s focused on higher education. College is not for everyone.  Of course, higher education is focused on higher education.  Conversely, trade schools are focused on trade schools.  People who do not want to go to college have other options.   > It used to be that young adults were taught a skill in highschool.  In the 1990s schools started closing down the sheet metal , auto mechanic , wood working, farming programs to name a few. This led to a mass amount of unprepared people being pushed into furthering education in areas that simply do not have the demand. Side effect was the whole student loan movement because how else were they all going to keep up with the narrative?  That narrative is ludicrous.   Never in American history have young adults been educated in high school.  After all, it is a fact that teenagers are not the same thing as young adults.  Furthermore, industries that previously required skills for sheet metal and woodworking were automated.  It is illogical to spend education funds on skills that are no longer required by their industries.  There are still lots of high schools across the country that teach other skills like auto mechanics, nursing assistant, information technology, etc.  The student debt crisis is the direct result of another crappy policy from Republicans.

Let us hope that they bring back the programs that prepared people to make a living in this world. There are enough college graduates not even working in their field of study. That system is already broken.  There are lots of causes of ignorance.  Aside from religious reasons, there is personal freedoms as you stated.  Personal freedoms include contriving narratives that are based on obviously absurd premises.  No high school is bringing back woodworking to teach teenagers as a job skill because this is not the 1800s where people can make a scratch living in that industry by making furniture by hand which cannot fulfill in supply and demand in our modern era.  We can fix systems.  The Republicans clearly have no interest in fixing the student debt crisis they wrought in our nation.",ResidentKelpien,2025-05-02T07:52:11,7
