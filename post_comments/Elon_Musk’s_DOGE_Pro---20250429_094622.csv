"He's giving thousands of valuable federal workers huge bribes to quit, over $20,000 per person.  Who approved all that spending?    He's going to cost taxpayers hundreds of billion just to fix the damage he caused.    Meanwhile, he's fucking over average Americans who have lost access to crucial services.  Even worse, he's taking all our highly personal data, and giving it to his creepy AI to control us.   Musk is a traitor.",insuproble,2025-04-29T09:53:12,16
Elon Musk’s DOGE has promised big savings for the federal budget but a new analysis finds that spending is actually up this year versus recent years.  The non-profit news organization [NOTUS](https://www.notus.org/whitehouse/doge-elon-musk-100-days) looked at daily Treasury statements to find that since President Trump returned to the White House the federal government has spent $171 billion more than in the same period for the two prior years.

"It’s going to be up even higher once Americans realized he illegally fired or forcibly resigned over 250,000 civil servants.  Losing several thousand employees from any company would make country-wide news, never mind several *hundreds* of thousands. Not a peep.  The administration hasn’t been keep records, so it’s hard to say exact numbers. If you don’t believe me, head on over to r/fednews and just listen to what is going on for federal employees. It’s a disaster. They are absolutely traumatized. Entire *very important* divisions and teams have been completely wiped out across all of the various agencies.   It will take decades to rebuild what Musk has destroyed in 100 days. No one was safe. Even agencies that are federally funded but completely independent (with independent boards) were all shuttered and closed overnight.   Rebuilding isn’t just going to take decades, it’s going to cost billions of dollars. Musk just cost this country so much more than he’d ever “save.”  He had one job… and it sure as shit wasn’t to save the federal government money. It was to steal as much information and data as possible and funnel it to Russia.  Second to that was to shutter or destroy every agency that was investigating him, or one of his businesses.

"The only way to strip either of them of their power is for people to stop being ruled by fear. Fear is what is keeping everyone at bay. He will sue you into oblivion, or put some maggot in the next election to replace you if you don’t tow the Trump party line. When are people going to stop being intimidated by the fear this Old nasty smelling lame duck president is using to bully our country.   We’ve lost all the worldly respect our grandparents generation so bravely gave their lives to build taking on Hitler and the Japanese empire and we just pissed it all away, why? Fear! Fear of whatever scares everyone. Corruption, Gods wrath, Cost of Eggs, you name it. Until we stop being ruled by fear this is never going to stop.  Remember, if you’re not part of the solution then you’re part of the problem. I don’t have all the answers, if I did I’d be leading the solution. Just complaining on here is not going to fix our issues. Somebody is going to have to take the reins and lead the sheep to the barn if we are going to fix this issue. This isn’t a government issue this is a people issue. Were the government, of the people and by the people. If our representatives are not doing their jobs they need to be replaced. If there are millions of people pissed off by Trumps BS…. Why aren’t we organizing and doing something about it? I’ve seen a couple of protests and we go home and nothing happens. Our voices are not being heard or taken seriously.  People just want to know when and where and nobody wants to take the charge. I’m so confused by this….",Psychopaths-Wife,2025-04-29T19:19:54,1
