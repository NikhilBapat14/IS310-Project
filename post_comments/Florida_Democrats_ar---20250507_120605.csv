*Several said they were livid that the nearly $25 million poured into a pair of April congressional special elections was not used to invest in state-party building.*  This is it.  To much revenge fundraising in low-probability elections against high-visibility candidates without looking at the big picture.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-07T12:12:13,9
Pretty damning they can't beat Rick Scott.,SkylarPopo,2025-05-07T12:13:39,5
old news. It's only a question of how broken they have become.  There is no reason for intraparty unity without the ability to achieve electoral victory in the state. So the major factions are going to splinter.,drackcove,2025-05-07T12:16:13,4
"...Is the animated corpse of DWS still sitting on the throne, patting itself on the back for burying the hatchet in Bernie's?  As long as 90s-era ""centrists"" care more about their petty fiefdoms than the future of the country, this will keep happening.",PapaSnork,2025-05-07T12:22:28,6
The Florida Democratic Party helped enable a purple state to descend into full-blown redness through their own fecklessness. Everybody involved in running the party at a state-wide level should've resigned in disgrace after the 2022 midterms.,INAC___Kramerica,2025-05-07T12:38:25,3
"We sure they are democrats, or republicans that registered someone with the same name?      I'm not saying they did that, but they have done that.",ianrl337,2025-05-07T12:07:32,6
It's the classic Democratic story. Don't try at all to invest in local or state races and then wonder why you're losing them all.,Scarlettail,2025-05-07T12:29:09,4

Not just in Florida. The only reason Trump won is because the Democratic Party has drifted so far from the traditional democratic principles it once stood that centrists started relating more to Trump than their own party. If you align yourself with the whiny crybaby weakest ideologies and citizens this country has to offer its only natural the ones who strengthen this country come together and fight the enemies who wish to destroy us.,shallowhal85,2025-05-07T12:28:28,-4
I think the Democratic party needs to fall apart to actually win. It needs to stop trying to cater to the imaginary middle and losing in every election. It needs to stop claiming it's for the working class and accepting ~~PAC money~~ bribes from Lockheed and Exxon. It needs to drive the messaging on wanting change for the voting class and actually delivering. Right now it has no identity.,friendsafariguy11,2025-05-07T14:15:16,0
Not especially surprising people are leaving the party.  It seems like they're on the wrong side of every issue.,box-cable,2025-05-07T12:08:06,-26
I always say that democrats care more about controlling their party than the country and republicans care more about controlling the country than their party.  edit: word,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-07T13:00:00,6
"Bernie's wing can win nationally, despite what DWS says, but not here, where it's associated with socialism way to much..",IvantheGreat66,2025-05-10T12:19:50,1
"Itâ€™s not alignment, itâ€™s protecting freedom. Only fighting for those you agree with isnâ€™t protecting freedom, itâ€™s preserving privilege.   Republicans have a list of Americans that they believe shouldnâ€™t have the same freedoms as them. Democrats have to step up when republicans attack Americans. Itâ€™s not alignment, itâ€™s patriotism.",d_c_d_,2025-05-07T12:49:47,6
Donâ€™t absolve the voters who chose Trump.  Zero excuses and I hope they pay dearly for those choices.,NigerianPrince76,2025-05-07T13:09:03,2

Im not a republican but Iâ€™m not aware of any Americans they think should have less freedoms than they do?,shallowhal85,2025-05-07T14:50:15,1
"Absolve? Absolve people for their right to cast a vote? Nobody needs to be absolved of anything, at least the guy they voted for is doing the job and not senile hiding in a bunker from the citizens for weeks.",shallowhal85,2025-05-07T14:51:44,-1
