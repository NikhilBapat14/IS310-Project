"While this is terrible and yet another slap in the face from this shitshow of an administration, this really isn't anything that police don't already do.   In Louisville in 2020 during the Breonna Taylor/George Floyd protests, LMPD violated every kind of ethical and moral boundary you can imagine. No officers ever got on the bull horn to announce a dispersal order, an unlawful assembly order or a warning that shots were going to be fired before they started shooting at people. My friend got shot in the face with a pepper ball at close range, while in a car in traffic. One girl took a rubber bullet to the forehead and is permanently disfigured. They shot pepper balls at journalists faces. They cornered peaceful protesters and arrested them over an hour before curfew. They called in the national guard. One cop fired a bunch of pepper balls into a business on private property, prompting the owner to return fire (as he thought he was in danger). They opened fire on him and left his dead body in the street for 12 hours. All this because people had the audacity to march in the streets after one of our citizens was unjustly murdered.   The police are already a dangerous militia. This just makes them basically immune from prosecution for doing the heinous shit they already do.  ETA: This is what the cops already do.

"I agree, however the recent [executive orders](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/strengthening-and-unleashing-americas-law-enforcement-to-pursue-criminals-and-protect-innocent-citizens/) essentially expand their power and protect them from the consequences of doing such things",Worldly-Spare4287,2025-04-30T18:36:44,1
