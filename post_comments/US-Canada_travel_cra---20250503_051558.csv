Earlier projections of a prolonged profit surge fueled by resilient travel demand and limited seat availability have been sharply undercut by mounting economic pressure and shifting traveler behavior.   >  > Travel is one of the first costs to be trimmed when wallets tighten, and the broader economic signals are becoming hard to ignore. Concerns over inflation, rising living costs, and potential job instability are prompting many Americans to delay or downgrade their travel plans, casting a shadow over what was expected to be a robust year for the aviation sector.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2025/04/29/canadian-us-travel-drops/83253116007/   > Delayen isn't the only Canadian forgoing trips south of the border. Canadian travel to the U.S. is slipping quickly. In March, the number of Canadians crossing the border by car dropped a staggering 32% compared to the same month last year, according to Statistics Canada. Air travel wasn’t far behind, falling 13.5% year-over-year. After a 12% decline in Canadian visitors to California in February, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a tourism campaign in April encouraging Canadians to visit his ""welcoming"" state.   https://moneywise.com/news/real-estate-news/done-with-florida-canadians-snowbirds-are-selling-their-properties-and-canceling-trips   > Gulf Coast News recently reported on “a mass exodus” of Canadians from Southwest Florida as new travel regulations are imposed and the trade war escalates. >  > CNN also recently reported on snowbirds considering alternative destinations or selling their properties. “Some of the clients I have been dealing with want to sell at any cost, even at a loss,” said Share Ross, a realtor based in southeast Florida. >  > “More home purchases in the U.S. are done by Canadians than any other country — 13% from April 2023 to March 2024, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) says,” reported CBC News. “Half of all Canadian purchases were vacation homes, and roughly 41% of sales were in Florida.” >  > This will likely have a ripple effect on the tourism industry and local businesses.",tech57,2025-05-03T07:15:45,1
