"It's worth reading Gore's actual quote, buried midway through politico's article:  >Gore, for his part, cited German philosophers’ “moral autopsy on the Third Reich” in the aftermath of World War II.  >“It was \[Jürgen\] Habermas’ mentor, Theodore Adorno, who wrote that the first step in that nation’s descent into hell was, and I quote, ‘the conversion of all questions of truth into questions of power,”’ Gore said. “He described how the Nazis, and I quote again, ‘attacked the very heart of the distinction between true and false.’ End quote.

"Far too many Americans think that Nazis were just these wild monsters that ran around goose stepping and murdering Jews for fun. But the terrifying reality is that most Nazis were just regular folks that sat in Germany and lived normal, mundane lives, secure in the idea that Hitler was making Germany a safer place for ""real"" Germans. They didn't go around murdering anyone. They just looked the other way as it happened and supported their government throughout the process.",needlestack,2025-04-22T01:31:17,36
" I know that the term ""fascism"" gets used often and tends to lose its meaning the more that Republicans dismiss it as some kind of universal, pejorative term that conveys very little to them the more they hear it...  Almost as if they believe the more they are called ""fascists,"" the less likely they are to *be* fascists. That being said, see how many parallels you can draw between MAGA and fascism based on the words of these following experts (I had to paraphrase):  Robert Paxton, author of ""*Anatomy of Fascism""* explains what mobilizes fascists:  - a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions - the primacy of the group... - the belief that one’s group is a victim, a sentiment that justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against its enemies. - dread of the group’s decline. - the need for closer integration of a purer community... - the need for authority by natural chiefs (always male), culminating in a national chieftain... - the superiority of the leader’s instincts over abstract and universal reason - the beauty of violence when [it is] devoted to the group’s success. - the right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint...  Jason Stanley, author of *""How Fascism Works,""* describes fascist tactics:  - The mythical past—used to invoke a nostalgia for a fictional time when the nation was great... - Propaganda—to attack enemies, to justify violence... to support the authoritarian leader. - Anti-intellectualism—to attack the media, universities, and scientists when they contradict the strong man’s authority. - Unreality—supporting conspiracy theories that tarnish the “Other” along with an outright denial of facts. - Hierarchy—espousing a “natural order”... - Victimhood—casting “Us” as victims of “Them”, who are taking resources from “Us” and demanding special rights. - Law and order—using laws to justify violence... - Sexual anxiety... - Dismantling of public welfare and unity...  Then there's Laurence W. Britt, who published *""Fascism Anyone?""*, which includes a list of 14 defining characteristics of fascism:  - Powerful and continuing expressions of nationalism - Disdain for the importance of human rights - Identification of enemies/scapegoats as a unifying cause - The supremacy of the military/avid militarism - Rampant sexism - A controlled mass media - Obsession with national security - Religion and ruling elite tied together - Power of corporations protected - Power of labor suppressed or eliminated - Disdain and suppression of intellectuals and the arts - Obsession with crime and punishment - Rampant cronyism and corruption - Fraudulent elections  Let's face it, Trump and MAGA cover almost all the bases here.  The MAGA movement is fueled by anti-immigrant fervor, ultra nationalistic and nativist attitudes, and sentiments derived from the idea that Trump and his supporters are *true* patriots and are thus entitled to rights, freedoms, privileges and immunities that others aren't.  The importance of human rights only extends to those within the MAGA orbit, while Republicans have been threatening to roll back civil rights and protections for marginalized groups, foreigners, and all those who exist outside of a white, Christian hegemony.  For decades, Republicans have been waging their culture wars against ""enemies"" and ""scapegoats"" that take the form of radical leftist, ""woke"" secular boogeymen threatening a conservative and heteronormative America.  Republicans will justify interventionism and expansionism when it suits their goals.  The MAGA movement is driven by misogyny and antiquated notions about gender norms and women's independence while they incessantly complain about the mistreatment of white males and insist it's a result of a ""crisis of masculinity"" caused by ""the left.""  The Trump administration attacks the media, threatens to defund independent journalism, stifles the free press, restricts access to information, flags historical content, thousands of online images and articles, and hundreds of terms for removal, and all while complaining about ""censorship,"" and their right to ""free speech"" being taken away, thinking they're entitled to say whatever they want without consequences...  But they've clearly shown us that when *they* have the power to control the media and the spread of information, it's perfectly justifiable for them to punish opposing viewpoints and claim ownership and control over how information is shared to the public.  Trump and his allies have been threatening to use the power of the justice system to seek retribution against political opponents. They've been proposing using national security measures to target protestors and political dissidents.  Proponents of a Christian nationalist agenda are embedded deep in our government, and they have more power than ever to implement a faith-based ""rule of law.""  The GOP's goals are to cripple what's left of the labor movement, safeguard corporations and special interests, cut taxes for the rich, redistribute wealth to the top, and install corporate executives and billionaires into positions of power.  Republicans thrive off of anti-intellectualism, are attacking universities and students, are sending literal thought police to campuses, are threatening to dismantle entire departments and programs, are demanding that foreign students be reported on and that universities only teach Trump administration approved ""viewpoints.""  They're threatening to defund higher education institutions, slash funding for scientific research and grants, while one of their goals is to fracture the entire public education system, which will disproportionately impact underserved communities.  Their law and order rhetoric is thinly veiled dog whistling, meant to incite hostility towards minorities, immigrants and marginalized groups.  Their obsession with crime and punishment can be seen in their constant threats to seek vengeance against their political adversaries, in their disregard for basic constitutional rights, in Trump's attacks on law firms and judges, and his political reprimand of anyone who has tried to hold him accountable. Trump has even sought retribution against former officials who didn't go along with his election fraud lies.  Hell, he's even issued threats towards those who investigated him for the role he played in facilitating January 6th and conspiring to overturn the 2020 election  Corruption, obstruction of justice and rampant cronyism are party tenets. Loyalty is a priority within Trump's circle and plays a major role in securing power and influence within Trump's administration.  Trump has been abusing the powers of his executive to arrest, detain and deport hundreds of people without due process.  His administration is seeking to end birthright citizenship and disregard the two term presidential limit.  And lastly, Trump and his allies have and will continue to go to great lengths to deny, subvert and overturn the results of any election they've lost.  Unfortunately, there aren't enough characters in a reddit post to cover all the parallels between our current administration and fascist regimes of the past, but it is nonetheless undeniable, fascism has taken root in this country, and its name is MAGA.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-22T02:11:47,15
"> “I understand very well why it is wrong to compare Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich to any other movement,” Gore said to an audience of roughly 150 climate advocates and policymakers gathered at a science museum on San Francisco’s waterfront. “It was uniquely evil, full stop.

But there are important lessons from the history of that emergent evil.”  *Exactly* what I’ve been trying to convey, and what I hope people start realizing… historical contextualization isn’t taboo",Ok_Character_5532,2025-04-22T06:01:34,13

Cantor Fitzgerald supported the heritage foundation specifically Russ Vought (head of the office of budget management) when he wrote project 2025. All these actions that Trump is taking is part of a plan called scapegoat mechanism. Basically the idea is have a person in charge makes such horrible decisions that the people get so angry for change that you oblige and replace that leader. This making the masses think those problems are gone.  JD Vance is who they want to replace Trump. Vance’s benefactor, donor and mentor for over 10 years believes women should never have gotten that right is Peter Thiel. Peter Thiel personally escorted Vance into Mar-a-lago to smooth tensions between Vance and Trump. Gave Vance $15 million to become senator.  Palantir is what found Elon his adult and kids DOGE team and anyone that says Elon and Peter don’t like each other are fooling themselves, they worked together on PayPal and disagreed when one was promoted over the other. X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years to fully test it and make sure it’s secure for the long term instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the FCC.  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html  Palantir which is led by real life German nazi (born in west Germany and raised in Swakopmund an insanely Nazi celebrating town in the 70’s where Peter Thiel’s father worked as an engineer on an uranium mine in violation of international law). Understand that the decision to fire the NSA chief and his deputy may be in fact be the most dangerous decision Trump has made so far along with the signing of the April 9th executive order removing all environmental protections and regulations through a sunset order which by all accounts even if scotus has to review it will not be stopped.  Anyone that’s says Peter Thiel doesn’t control Palantir is uninformed. Thiel directly owns roughly 180 million publicly traded shares which is 7%. His investment firm Rivendell 7 owns 34 million publicly traded shares. Other Thiel vehicles own 37 million shares. Thiel entities also own 32.5 million supervoting Class B shares in Palantir. Those class b shares carry 10 votes while public ones carry only 1 vote per share. Now here is the kicker for why he still controls Palantir (link below), Thiel has sole investment power over 335,000 class F shares as part of a trust that has 49.99% voting interest in the company.  https://www.barrons.com/articles/palantir-stock-chairman-peter-thiel-b63415c7  Timothy Haugh (recently fired NSA chief) like his last 2 predecessors were restricting the access and control Peter Thiel had through his company Palantir over the CIA/NSA to commit domestic surveillance. Palantir is the 2nd biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA along with providing day-to-day operations for both agencies along with UK intelligence agencies and their NHS, which is why NHS England was announced to be shutting down. The goal for Palantir is and always has been domestic surveillance and they already have it happening all across the UK with their police forces. Palantir is an intelligence corporation which provides advanced analysis, sigint, osint, criminal and threat awareness and kill chain efficiencies to all levels of US, UK, and corporate agencies.  https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-recruiting-palantir/  https://www.salon.com/2024/07/22/jd-vance-owes-almost-everything-to-peter-thiel-a-pro-billionaire-and-new-right-ideologue/  https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/08/jd-vance-women-weird-voting-peter-thiel.html",nycdiveshack,2025-04-22T04:58:41,20

"The German people as a whole was also blamed for the Fascism 90 years ago in a way the American people isn't blamed for the Fascism today in any similar extent. In the last free elections 37% of the Germans voted for Hitler. In a later election after already having been in power for a few months he almost reached 44%. But that was in what with the most rosy of possible descriptions could be called semi free elections. After that the dictatorship was absolute, with only one alternative to vote for.  Still, the German people was considered responsible as a whole. It was no crime to rape German women in 1945. Around 250 000 died in connection to the rapes. It wasn't unusual that women were raped more than 50 times. The German people as a whole was punished for electing Hitler. Around 40% did. The majority was never close to vote for him in a free election, even in a very poor Germany.  Trump has more support today than Hitler ever had in free elections. Still, the problem is usually said to be that Trump is bad or Vance is stupid etc. But the people who voted for Trump continue to support him. Threatening to invade friendly allied territory, saying that Ukraine started the war, admiring Putin and the German neo-Nazis, calling Zelensky a dictator, the European democracies very evil, posting giddy oops messages when he bombs people in what he calls ""shithole countries"" etc.  But 45-50% of the American people support him, which is easy to forget every time some news article mentions what the current administration is doing.

"I've never bought the idea of brainwashing or education or anything being responsible for Trump supporters. The reason they support him is because they are bigots who were held in check by standards and consequences before Trump came onto the scene, and they got Trump in because he openly promised to let them step on the people they hate or otherwise make those people they hate suffer. Trump has been waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too obvious that he was going to wreck the country especially over the last few years for either stupidity or ignorance to be the reason.  As for the apathy, that's the end result of decades of having only two parties as realistic choices:  \-The Republicans, a party of complete power hungry psychos whose only interest is money and power while being in the pockets of corporations and rich assholes to the point they eventually put a rich asshole as their party leader. A party that constantly gets away with voter suppression tactics and rigging elections openly because they can't win elections otherwise and absolutely nothing is done about it. MAGA is nothing more than the Republican party that doesn't even bother to put up a pretense of civility and moral values they claimed they gave a damn about anymore because they know they didn't have to any longer ever since Trump got on the scene. Anyone who ever actually bought into the pretense and claims of morality when they joined the Republican party left the party in droves when it became clear with Trump's arrival that the party didn't give a damn about any of it.  \- The Democrats, a party of do nothings who sit around doing only a fraction of what they are capable of doing at any given time (including now) whether they're in power or not, who are also in the pockets of corporations and rich assholes, just a tiny bit less obvious about it. A party who could have stopped this nonsense from ever happening at any point even in the last year and did absolutely nothing about it because their whole strategy as a political party is to sit on their asses doing next to nothing, let the Republicans get in and wreck the country, and then use that to get back in by looking as the ""sane"" option but never actually doing all that much once they get in. In part because they're lazy and it's easier to do next to nothing and in larger part because it would effect their corporate and rich donors to actually fix the country.  The apathy came from the fact that people were burnt out over the fact that they didn't have any actually good leaders to pick from.

It's not like Hitler where he at least pretended to be remotely sane and worked to look charismatic up until the point he had absolute power and thus no longer had to care about hiding it, upon which the crazy completely came out.  Trump supporters support him not because they want a better country especially after his first term, they know he won't give them that and any claims to the contrary are just smokescreens to hide the real reason to try to trick people into thinking they have a morally good or at least understandable reason. Trump supporters him because Trump is an openly bad person and they're openly bad people who wanted him in and continue to support him because he lets them be openly bad people are well, and that's true of every single one of them.

And it is very common for people to change states in pursuit of quality in one area or another -  housing prices, weather, education quality, employee protections, better recreational fishing...   People align themselves to a state because of their priorities.  And then the people with those shared priorities decide what the state government should prioritize. It's why we have such varying political viewpoints state to state. Because people literally move to places where the politics are in line with their views.

The 1997 attacks on the US embassy buildings in Africa, a dual truck bomb attack, were his. And even in 2000, the USS Cole was blown up.

Humans are primed for that level of self reflection but we should try to be honest with ourselves instead of heavily romancing the events as they occurred, as if often the case since it is easier.  I think the intel that was shared painted a far rosier picture of the military operation and there would have been far less support for it if we had known the timeline we were looking at. Thing is, Afghanistan was already very, very well known as the graveyard of empires amongst military scholars at the time so the framing of the Bush admin as if we were gonna get in, get the Taliban, get Osama, and be out in time for supper was an incredible exaggeration of what they knew to be possible. Their later intel about yellow cake in Iraq turned out to be faulty, further painting the image of an administration that was too comfortable either firing from the hip or in stretching the truth as it was to the American public in order to accomplish their geopolitical goals.",maikuxblade,2025-04-22T02:22:00,1

"No the Democrats wouldn't have done this, and that's irrelevant. The ""Both Parties"" shit comes down the fact that the Democrats had the opportunity to do a hell of a lot more, definitely to stop this garbage at literally any point in the last several decades and did next to nothing if anything at all. The problem with the Democratic party are they sit on their asses doing a tiny fraction of what they're capable of doing. I'm not just talking about situations like now when they don't have control of any of the three branches of government either, I'm talking about even when they DO have control they don't do anywhere near as much as they can.  If the Democratic party had spent the last several decades putting even 1/10th of the amount of effort and with the unity that the Republican party does to get *their* agendas through and to stonewall the Democratic party (both of which the the Republican party has managed to do far far more often than they by all rights should ever be able to) the entire country would be far better off, Democratic party would've been winning every election from local to state to federal level with ease, the Republican party would basically not even exist anymore, and there would already be measures in place to stop a guy like Trump in the snowball's chance in hell he was able to get into the presidency. There should already be amendments, laws, and procedures in place to immediately stop Trump from doing at least half of what he's doing right now without impeachment even being necessary in spite of the guy having support from all three branches of government. However, that takes effort and Democrat politicians as a whole are really really lazy.  The Democrats love to say ""when they go low we go high"", but that would imply they punch back. What the Democrats do is let the Republicans kick them in the balls over and over again and instead of punching them in the face back they stand there going ""would you please stop that?"" again and again no matter how many times trying to ""reach across the aisle"" fucks them over and lets the Republicans get more and more power they shouldn't be having. It's the Republicans taking advantage of how lazy and non-confrontational the Democratic party as a whole has always been that led to one step after another to bring us to this very situation and it's why they're doing next to nothing now. No matter how much it doesn't work, the Democratic party keeps treating the Republican party like old friends they should work with instead of enemies they should be doing everything in their power to stop, even as the Republicans stop at nothing to destroy the Democrats and take advantage of their goodwill to grab power.  The Democratic party has always been solely interested in maintaining the status quo rather than improving anything and rarely ever accomplish anything more than fixing the nonsense that the Republicans did the last time they were in power. The Democrats spend their time in office working to clean up the Republican messes rather than making it impossible for the Republicans to make a mess in the first place and if the United States ends up even slightly better off at the end of it all it's coincidental at best. The Democrats were all but exclusively responsible for all the government programs we take for granted when not only could they have put in a lot more they did nothing to keep the Republicans from being able to just throw those out on a whim when they got a hold of all three branches.  The Republican party spent decades eroding human rights and working to be able to grab more and more power and the Democrats barely did anything to stop them, slow them down at best. A crazy idiot like Trump not only getting in but also having all three branches of government in his pocket was an inevitability precisely because of how the Democratic party operates. It turns out if there's a baby grabbing the matches and trying to light things on fire if you do nothing to stop the kid from being able to light things on fire he's going to eventually burn the house down, even if you make a token attempt to put out his fires after he sets them. At best the Democratic party delayed this situation and at worst they enabled it.  The Democratic party could have easily stopped this entire situation years ago, or even a year ago, and they didn't and clearly had no intention of doing so. That's why people say Both Sides. A side that's actively doing evil and a side that stands there and lets the other side do evil things without even faking that they're trying to keep the other party from being able to do evil things are functionally the same thing.  Even if Trump IS stopped and we have a functioning democracy in four years and the Democrats take back control it's not going to matter in the slightest if the Democrats keep up the same old same old sit on our asses strategy instead of working to make sure the same nonsense Trump is doing can never happen again.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-22T12:56:21,1

"For my part, I knew some general facts about Niemoller and Bonhoeffer.  I'm not quite sure how, exactly, as they were not talked about in schools.  But if you are interested in 20th century history, they will be names you see and have at least a few things like what they did, why it was important, and what happened to them.  But you have to at least have the curiosity to find it on your own and many just aren't that curious.  Even so, lots of adult Americans know of at least one of them.  I suppose the movements, Hitler and Trump, are hard to understand from the outside. I don't see the appeal, but it seems to have reached a point in the US where opportunists are joining Trump's movement.  The church thing worries me, but I was reading Robert Paxton describing why he thought Germany changed:  >Hitler’s drive to shrink the normative state and expand the prerogative state was much more sustained than Mussolini’s. Total master of his party, Hitler exploited its radical impulses for his own aggrandizement against the old elites and rarely (after the exemplary bloodbath of June 1934) needed to rein it in. Another suggested key to radicalization is the chaotic nature of fascist rule. Contrary to wartime propaganda and to an enduring popular image, Nazi Germany was not a purring, well-oiled machine. Hitler allowed party agencies to compete with more traditional state offices, and he named loyal lieutenants to overlapping jobs that pitted them against each other. The ensuing “feudal” struggles for supremacy within and between party and state shocked those Germans proud of their country’s traditional superbly trained and independent civil service. Fritz-Dietlof Count von der Schulenburg, a young Prussian official initially attracted to Nazism, lamented in 1937 that “the formerly unified State power has been split into a number of separate authorities; Party and professional organizations work in the same areas and overlap with no clear divisions of responsibility.” He feared “the end of a true Civil Service and the emergence of a subservient bureaucracy.”  >We saw in the previous chapter how the self-indulgently bohemian Hitler spent as little time as possible on the labors of government, at least until the war. He proclaimed his visions and hatreds in speeches and ceremonies, and allowed his ambitious underlings to search for the most radical way to fulfill them in a Darwinian competition for attention and reward. His lieutenants, fully aware of his fanatical views, “worked toward the Führer,” who needed mainly to arbitrate among them. Mussolini, quite unlike Hitler in his commitment to the drudgery of government, refused to delegate and remained suspicious of competent associates—a  governing style that produced more inertia than radicalization.  It seems to me that the US government is very far along this same road, and the radicalization is rapidly accelerating. Our civil service is being destroyed, and the subservient bureaucracy installed.",I_who_have_no_need,2025-04-22T21:46:48,2

It's still stupid, as you say, because removing them does not remove the underlying cause of the attack. If anything, the ""war on terror"" seriously weakened the USA and strengthened various countries and movements opposed to it because it showed (again) the limitations of military might and the weakness of the USA's political structure.  > The Taliban would have been is disarray   This is unlikely, given that he was essentially just a (rich) foreigner sort of living in the country that they didn't want to extradite and whose ideology they supported.

For 2020 it was won fairly by Biden even though Republicans cried foul.

I highly recommend reading up on that as well.  Greg Palast has for example made a compelling case that Trump would have lost if not for these tactics.  And I’m not talking about general pre election purge numbers alone, but people who were specifically turned away as ineligible on a “technicality” even though they were very much eligible citizens.

There were a few Republican counties with suspect numbers, but not enough to turn the election over for the President.  What is troubling however, is how they pulled out all the stops for voter suppression.  Last minute purges with little to no time for voters to re-register.  Closing of polling places.  Militant Republicans ""policing"" ballot boxes and even in more than one case setting them ablaze, intimidating legitimate voters and causing disengagement.  With Biden/Trump the count was 81m for Biden, 74m for Trump. (306/232)  For 2024 it was 77m Trump, 75m Harris. (312/226)  A key point that is brought up via verifiable investigative journalism since the 2024 election is that Kamala Harris was denied **3,565,000 votes** due to mass disqualification tactics of valid voters as well as increased legal challenges in swing states.  From Greg Palast:  * 4,776,706 voters were wrongly purged from voter rolls according to US Elections Assistance Commission data. * By August of 2024, for the first time since 1946, self-proclaimed “vigilante” voter-fraud hunters challenged the rights of 317,886 voters. The NAACP of Georgia estimates that by Election Day, the challenges exceeded 200,000 in Georgia alone. * No less than 2,121,000 mail-in ballots were disqualified for minor clerical errors (e.g. postage due). * At least 585,000 ballots cast in-precinct were also disqualified. * 1,216,000 “provisional” ballots were rejected, not counted. * 3.24 million new registrations were rejected or not entered on the rolls in time to vote.  And yes, this even affected the EC outcome in Kamala's favor for most swing states she lost which would have won her the election.  That is the key point being driven here, as the EC result is the only count that ultimately matters in the end.",NeverLookBothWays,2025-04-22T11:48:23,1

"(Reply to your comment that was deleted)    But democrats outspend republicans regularly, so I would say there *must* have been a counter to right-wing propaganda. Well, it was established that the Harris campaign used their funds poorly (like paying millions to celebrity speakers that effected little change)  I sincerely think running Harris in 2028 would be a massive error, as well as her running for California governor. Newsom or Whitmer IMO have the best chance next cycle.  I personally prefer Steven A. Smith, but he’s going to have a very tough run.",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T11:56:28,1

Well, it was established that the Harris campaign used their funds poorly (like paying millions to celebrity speakers that effected little change) I sincerely think running Harris in 2028 would be a massive error, as well as her running for California governor.  Yea that was the point I was hitting at as well.  Republicans simply do not need to spend as much to get results as their propaganda arm is established and spread out enough to where they do the campaign work for them without a penny of campaign dollars spent.  Democrats on the other hand have nothing even remotely close to that kind of reach, so have to campaign the old-fashioned way, which to be honest, is somewhat annoying as a voter to experience in this day and age.  They were going door to door, getting endorsements, texting the hell out of my cellphone, etc.  So yea, with that in mind, Democrats absolutely should get a messaging platform funded and built that can take on the Republican propaganda machine head on.  And that means, actually invest in local am/fm radio and old media like newspapers and TV networks, especially FTA in red states and counties.  This is not something the party should be funding itself either, but rather incentivizing wealthy donors and grass roots movements into building from the ground up.  It took around 30 years for Republicans to build their machine to ensure another Republican like Nixon would ever be held accountable for their actions again.  It will take decades of work for Democrats to build up something that can effectively counter it.  This is not a problem that can be solved overnight.  I 100% agree Harris should not be on the 2028 ticket, but I also believe she has a right to run in the primaries if she wants to, and let the primary voters decide.  The DNC needs to stop screwing this up, as we would have absolutely elected Bernie over Hillary when we had an opportunity to.  The DNC has in part handed two victories to Trump by meddling where they shouldn't and not being assertive enough where they should.",NeverLookBothWays,2025-04-22T12:06:27,1
"Oh, did he open up 30,000 new beds there before realizing it was too close to American military rules, so he moved it to fucking El Salvador where he could pay our tax dollars to house our deportees in concentration camps? Huh, I didn't know that.",debrabuck,2025-04-23T09:24:46,1
"I don’t have the time to reply with an equal length comment, but I fully agree Bernie got fucked over. He deserved more respect. I don’t agree with a lot of policies, I’m not really progressive or socialist, but I recognize that democratic leadership wanted him out.   Nah I disagree. Democrats have been unconventional for awhile now. Hillary did the whole “Pokémon Go to the polls” thing that was new, but sadly a bit cringe. Harris did a lot of work with celebrities that didn’t pan out (I think). Trump actually played it smart by targeting podcasts, livestreams and TikTok, which helped him secure young voters, especially young men. I do wonder if the Harris campaign lacked young advisors? I seems plain as day to me to get in JRE…but Harris refused to go to his studio.   I think she was too nervous or just wasn’t polished enough off-script (which is Donald’s wheelhouse, even if he lies a lot)  I don’t know how you feel about Steven A. Smith, but he has the right charisma to lead and speaks well. I like that he calls himself more center than anything, that speaks to me.",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T12:17:14,2
"So you're fine with guantanamo bay, fine with genocide at gaza, and somehow only trump is bad.  If it is not a double standard, I don't know what is.",Old_Captain_9131,2025-04-23T11:30:39,1
"I do like the guy and think if he wants to run for it he should.   I also think Walz should put his hat in the ring too as he is great at tearing down faulty Republican logic.  He did stumble a bit against JD Vance initially but I think he found his stride further in that debate.   Debating against bad faith arguments is tough.  Buttigieg is also phenomenal at debating.  Ultimately, I will support who comes up to plate and wins the primaries.  But we need those primaries to have our best chance at putting forth our strongest candidate.  We need to cut the superdelegate bullshit and DNC overrides when the people make their choice.",NeverLookBothWays,2025-04-22T12:21:29,1

"I'm NOT 'fine with Gitmo' and like most liberals, think it's a shitstain on America. The point is that Biden (nor any other president) didn't think to use it as an American gulag. Trump did, before being told it's too kind.",debrabuck,2025-04-23T11:49:23,1
"I’m telling you now, Smith is gonna be way more attractive to moderates and right-wingers. He has the right energy.   Walz could very well be equated to Harris and get dragged down. Buttigieg - I just don’t think America will elect a gay president at this time. He’s clearly smart, but I fear he’d lose a ton of support with minority men.

"I'm not the one lying, the genocide support was real. And you guys closed your eye on it. We all know that trump and maga are problems. What Biden did confirm that democrats are NOT the solution.",Old_Captain_9131,2025-04-23T11:53:19,1
"Yea, I see your point.  We unfortunately live in a very easily divided country due to the propaganda issue I outlined earlier.  With Smith it will likely be on race....as the saying goes ""we got Trump because America could not handle a black president""  He’ll also need to run on the Democrat platform too instead of independent or he’ll never get the EC votes necessary and will impact the Dem popular and swing vote negatively.  The bigotry and smear campaigns should not deter us though. What is important is the democratic vote outnumbers the republican vote, so if we actually get a solid primary winner, no matter who it is...and if we actually FIGHT against voter suppression, we have a winner regardless of the smears.  I'll vote for whoever wins the primaries, as I do not concern myself with race, orientation, gender, or any of that.  I want to live in a country that is accepting, honest, and fair...otherwise it's not worth investing more of my time and attention and I'll likely just expat out of here.",NeverLookBothWays,2025-04-22T12:28:11,2

"My worry is the dems will do what they do best, and push the far-left and moderate wings out and just run the same establishment crap. If the republicans can put up candidates like Trump why can’t the dems run someone unconventional? Smith would be.   I really doubt we’d have a race issue with Smith - he also doesn’t seem sensitive. We had Obama, and getting Smith won’t be some shock to white rednecks I think.   Sure it’ll piss off progressives, but at the end of the day moderates are more appealing IMO.   Thanks for remaining civil with me, my opinions are often ridiculed here. I got banned on news and worldnews for my views, and never got an explanation as to why I was banned.",AgileFlea77,2025-04-22T15:28:59,1
