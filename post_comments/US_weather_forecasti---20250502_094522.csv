"It's not really needed anymore. The Gulf of America is so tough and patriotic now that hurricanes will be too scared to come anywhere near the US. And if any libs use their weather machines to make hurricanes break though the Gulf, Trump can use his Sharpie to protect us.",Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-05-02T09:48:15,73
"From the article, “the National Weather Service is headed into hurricane season with 30 of its 122 weather forecast offices lacking their most experienced official, known as the meteorologist-in-charge.”  Also according to the article, “These include offices that cover major population centers such as New York City, Cleveland, Houston and Tampa.  “There is not a single manager in place at the hurricane-prone Houston-Galveston forecast office, according to a NOAA staff member who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal.”  “One NWS forecast office, in Goodland, Kansas, is no longer operating 24/7, with about a dozen more likely to shift to non-24-hour operations if action isn’t taken this month. These offices include several in the Plains states and stretch into the Pacific Northwest.”  “Such a change is virtually unheard of in the absence of an extreme weather event, such as a hurricane or tornado, that either threatens the lives of the forecasters themselves or knocks them offline.”  “There are also more than 90 vacancies among the staff responsible for repairing NWS Doppler radars and automated surface weather observation stations, the NOAA staff member said, greatly raising the likelihood of prolonged equipment outages that could affect air travel. Weather stations provide pilots and controllers with crucial data on wind direction and speed at airports to determine how to take off and land safely, among other parameters.”  “The NWS has lost more than 550 people all told, since the start of Trump’s second term, according to tallies kept by sources inside and outside of the agency. That’s about the same number as the agency lost in the 15 years between 2010 and 2025, according to Tom Fahy of Capitol Meteorologics.”  Even before the cuts that were done by Trump and Elon at Doge, the weather service was understaffed.",Da_Malpais_Legate,2025-05-02T09:54:48,13
"So let me get this straight.   The People in Red states most impacted by sever hurricane weather, voted in the stupidest man on the planet to lead the nation, and the first thing he did was get rid of all the scientists that monitor the weather that impacts them?  So now, they have no early warning system and won't be able to respond to this sever weather as easily?   And somehow, I am supposed to give a shit about these red neck assholes?",FreshRest4945,2025-05-02T09:49:42,40

"Less detailed warnings before will only exacerbate damages.    Less preparation and a less organized evacuation creates panic, which leads to violence, so more social stress and breakdown before *and* during the storm.    Under those conditions, looting and the reaction to it is predictably worse.   Less support and assistance with recovery efforts creates an exponential effect to all the issues already *made worse* **by this administration**.  Now, there's a lot to address, but one thing I think of is: *How the hell do they blame this on Biden?*   Those North Carolina folk for one, who dealt with the tropical storm in the mountains a year ago...who the Trump Campaign claimed was getting 'no assistance' from 'The Biden government' ... https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina. ... What can they tell Arkansas? https://arkansasadvocate.com/2025/04/25/trump-denies-disaster-aid-tells-states-to-do-more/   I mean, blaming *anyone* has **got to get old** at some point.

"The problem is just under half of the people who live in these states (myself included) vote Democratic and essentially live as hostages of the crazies who are the narrow majority. The constitutional amendments legalizing marijuana and overturning the abortion ban garnered over 50% support, but because the crazy state constitution requires a supermajority, they still failed. And before you say ""well just move, then!"" It's a lot easier said than done: People have careers, families, and houses (with mortgages that were locked in at much more affordable rates years ago) tying them to where they live. I can't wait to move, but the job market sucks right now and we have elderly relatives to care for. So just remember, a lot of people in these red states are sane and hate it just as much as you do  EDIT: Referring to Florida specifically, if it wasn't clear by context",drummer820,2025-05-02T10:29:05,24
"No, but you can give a shit about the sane people that voted against this garbage that still will suffer for it.    Most of my family is in the South and I've been lobbying for 20 years for them to get out.

Plus Trump seems to be blocking disaster assistance to both blue and red states so they won’t even get help rebuilding.unfortunately that also probably means we will have a bunch of homeless red state refugees flooding Blue states.,Ready_Nature,2025-05-02T10:28:53,5
