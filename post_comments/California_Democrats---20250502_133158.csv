"I have to wonder how many people actually read before commenting. Here is a key piece of the article, and the reason that so many people find Weiner to be objectionable:   ""Wiener’s bill would allow housing developers to build apartment, condo and mixed-use towers on or near train, subway and light rail stations, ferry terminals and at the intersection of heavily used bus lines, regardless of what local zoning or building design rules specify.""     This man is constantly trying to assert control over people and communities he has no affiliation with. communities that have people who are interested in their local neighborhoods quality of life and actually care about the effects of unplanned and unregulated growth. You don't have to be ""anti"" housing to see that taking away the voices of the people in favor of unregulated capitalism is a bad idea.",Great_Goat_Scratcher,2025-05-03T00:22:09,0

"It's not just them, it's also people who already own homes.  Any move that increases production will also slow the growth of housing prices (ie. the value of my house), and right now people are addicted to their houses as a financial vehicle rather than a utilitarian necessity.",Lord0fHats,2025-05-02T13:37:51,6

"As a homeowner, I disagree.  I can't realize that money unless I sell my house--which I have no plans to do.  However, most of the YIMBY measures support increasing the number of people in an area without increasing the necessary infrastructure.  Such as roads, public transportation, water, and more. I moved out of San Francisco because it became too dense. Traffic was a nightmare, public transit was nightmare. I ended up staying in my own neighborhood as much as possible. If I had to do that, why bother being in a city with umpteen great activities I never went to because it took so long to drive there and there was nowhere to park once I arrived?",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-02T14:03:35,-5
"thank you for the example of a useless, thoughtless comment that does not address valid concerns, and misrepresents a complex issue and the expressed point of view.

Or hell, look at transformations of existing neighborhoods over the course of a decade when you do things like gut parking minimums, allow denser building, and denser housing.

"There is also no guarantee that your job will be in the city.  My husband worked in tech and his jobs were always in the South Bay.  I worked in another field and most of my jobs were in the East Bay. Of course we changed jobs now and then but they were never in our neighborhood.  My husband's parents lived in the East Bay and we  wanted to be able to visit them, especially after my mother-in-law was widowed and needed us to help care for her. We lived in San Francisco because it was central to both the South Bay and the East Bay.  People advocating ""walkable cities,"" seem to assume that jobs for at least two adults per household will be walkable, which is just not true.   By the way, when I was commuting three hours a day for one of my jobs, yes it was a big problem for me. It wasn't \*your\* problem, but then the people who can't afford houses in San Francisco were  not \*my\* problem. As for the really dense cities like  Tokyo, I would never consider living there.  I moved to San Francisco when traffic was literally half what it was by the time I left. I don't care if you can't get a cheap house in your ideal area. I couldn't either, until my husband and I retired, my mother-in-law died, and we were able to move out of San Francisco.  By the way, there is plenty of California that is not either the San Fransisco Bay Area nor Greater Los Angeles. Please do not conflate San Francisco with California.  It really is a big state.  Maybe people who want more affordable housing should consider moving to another \*part\* of California.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-02T16:13:24,-1

"San Francisco public transportation is mostly designed to go downtown and back.  Changing between buses and trolleys  two or three times and waiting 20 minutes for the one you want is a loser.  If  public transportation had worked for me I would not have moved.  And once I saw a woman take out a knife and try to stab a total stranger sitting on the bus.  And in most places parking is horrendous.  My husband and I lived in one residential area built in the Edwardian era. Meaning there were no garages, but lots of small apartment buildings (six units). Every time we came home from anywhere, it took us 20 minutes to find a parking spot on a good day. It was often 40 minutes and once, it was 2 hours.  Driving round, and round, and round, waiting for someone to leave.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-02T16:10:27,1
"Most of the world existed before cars did. Most of America did not. LA for instance can not be converted into a park and ride city because it was literally built around the concept of having a car. Things are too spread out, there is not space to fix it, and even if you could no one would agree to it. Now expand that to literally every town and city in California. Not a single one of them is compact enough to do anything like this.  A city like Paris by contrast was built around the idea that people have to walk or ride a horse.

"Because, news flash, people didn't put many jobs into the residential areas I have lived in.  They don't plump large companies there.  Nor do they tend to put things like museums there.  See how that works?  You need to \*go places\*.  And all over, not just to the grocery store and back, not even just to work and back.  People are misled because they went to some large European city as tourists.  Where they stayed in hotels near the major attractions, and lots of restaurants, with public transit carefully organized to cater to tourists. They don't have to go to  work. They don't have to grocery shop.  Then they come back to the US and burble about how \*convenient\* these cities are and how you can go \*everywhere\* on public transit.

Then there's the dirt and mulch for the yard, the large tools, trees and shrubs to plant . . . Because when you own a house, you will be hauling supplies and tools for home repairs and yard work.
