This is really disappointing. The NEA supports so many important programs and artists. Cutting funding for arts and culture feels like a step backwards.,UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-04T10:15:15,7
"Some disappointing details:  >The Trump Administration has started canceling National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grants. > >Hundreds of arts groups of various sizes across the U.S. received emails notifying them of the withdrawal and termination of their grants late on Friday. The updates, which came from a generic ""arts.gov"" email address, appeared in grantees' inboxes just hours after President Trump proposed eliminating the agency entirely from the federal budget. > >Among those affected are the Berkeley Repertory Theater, Central Park Summer Stage in New York City, and the Chicago-area arts education nonprofit Open Studio Project. > >""The NEA is updating its grantmaking policy priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President,"" the email, several copies of which have been shared with NPR, stated in part. ""Consequently, we are terminating awards that fall outside these new priorities."" The email includes a line saying the recipient can appeal the decision within seven days. > >... > >Beyond the wave of cuts, the National Endowment for the Arts is among a group of ""small agency eliminations"" proposed by the Trump administration's 2026 Discretionary Budget Request, alongside the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. ""The Budget includes the elimination of, or the elimination of Federal funding for, the following small agencies — consistent with the President's efforts to decrease the size of the Federal Government to enhance accountability, reduce waste, and reduce unnecessary governmental entities. Past Trump administration budgets have also supported these eliminations. Remaining funds account for costs of orderly shutdowns,"" the budget request states. > >Since its founding by Congress in 1965, the National Endowment for the Arts has awarded $5.5 billion in grants. It is the largest arts funder in the U.S. — yet one of the smallest federal agencies. It is currently funded at $207 million, which represents a tiny fraction of the overall budget. According to an NEA fact sheet from 2022, the agency's funding amounts to 0.003% of the total federal budget. > >Republican administrations have called for its reduction and closure in the past, including during the first Trump presidency. However, the agency has historically received wide bi-partisan support because, as its website states, it ""supports arts organizations and artists in every congressional district in the country."" > >... > >""Any attempt to dismantle the National Endowment for the Arts — by eliminating funding, reducing staff, or canceling grants — is deeply concerning, shortsighted, and detrimental to our nation,"" said Erin Harkey, CEO of the national arts advocacy organization Americans for the Arts, in a statement shared with NPR. ""The NEA plays a vital role in the lives of millions of Americans and the thousands of nonprofit and governmental arts and cultural organizations that bring America's story to life.""  It's pretty clear that this move could shake up arts communities across the country. Given the other moves by the administration, it looks like their new priority for arts funding might be more to stir up conflicts between different groups, and also to prioritize propaganda over bona fide artistic expression.",Hrmbee,2025-05-04T10:19:15,3

"And the people hurt by this are primarily going to be the freelancers and gig workers that aren't eligible for unemployment, so the unemployment numbers will be unaffected despite people losing work. ",nolongertheingenue,2025-05-04T11:55:18,2
What is the opposition party and/or the advocacy groups doing in protest over this other than lamenting via social media?,feelionicsmusic,2025-05-05T20:51:35,1
It is a step backward. Ugly people making the world an uglier place. Might as well be their motto at this point.,JohnLandisHasGotToGo,2025-05-04T10:21:22,7
