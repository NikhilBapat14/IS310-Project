"Bondi's alleged reason for the delay in ""Epstein files on Day 1"" is that the FBI are having to go through tens of thousands of videos.   She's saying this because recently, James Comer (Republican Representative) was asked about the files and said ""I hope they're not shredding documents in overtime right now""",DanielMoore0515,2025-05-08T20:39:16,5995
This was probably his blackmail stash. A lot of people think Epstein really made his money by pimping out underage girls to important men and then blackmailing them. It’s probably not good that Trump now has that blackmail stash.,turb0_encapsulator,2025-05-08T21:34:17,5296

"Declaration of Broken Contract When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, to demand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance. The social contract has been broken. The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated. When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority collapses. In this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation without representation."" This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution. Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties. Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people. LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL --- GRIEVANCES --- 1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments) - U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order. 2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment) - Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance. 3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment) - Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis. 4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation"" - Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties. 5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment) - Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T17:53:46,2

Let's say Bezos, Musk, and Gates are named.  Everything tied to them gets banned, blackballed ,  and shunned.  Businesses, charities, etc, crash overnight.   The economic fallout would wreck the world. This is why the delay.   Even Trump understands that.   Also, there needs to be a strategic release of names, in order to set up arrests as soon as it comes out.  Same as the P Diddy list.

"The whole thing was *obviously* a Mossad honeypot intended to collect kompromat on influential people, particularly influential Americans.   Which is exactly why Epstein was quietly given a slap on the wrist and the lawyer who did so (Acosta) ended up working in Trump's administration as Labor Secretary as a payback so he didn't talk.  Israel depends greatly on continued American financial, military and diplomatic support for its ""way of life"" - giving its citizens universal healthcare on America's dime whilst bombing the Palestinians into the stone age.   So it's only common sense that it's intelligence services would go to great lengths to guarantee that influential Americans would unswervingly support Israel regardless of its barbaric acts.   The connections are everywhere and obvious - Ghislaine Maxwell was literally the daughter of the notorious Mossad agent Robert Maxwell who had connections with Epstein before Maxwell's own mysterious death.  It's interesting that Israel's media is allowed to report on the connections between Mossad and Epstein - you won't find such articles in the mainstream American media.  Anyway I'll be banned for mentioning this, but repeating the truth is always worth a shot.  https://www.timesofisrael.com/ghislaine-maxwells-family-history-marked-by-scandal-secrecy-and-conspiracy/  https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-writer-who-broke-epstein-case-a-rumored-mossad-link-is-worth-digging-into/  https://www.yahoo.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-ex-says-boasted-171553626.html  https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jeffrey-epstein-steven-hoffenberg-intelligence-agencies-spy-1197708/  > Some of these sources are more reliable than others. But the gist of the claims that you will be able to hear, and ultimately watch in a three-hour documentary series, is that Maxwell, who was himself a conduit between the Israelis and other governments during his life time, introduced Epstein to Israeli leaders, who then allegedly used Epstein as the equivalent of an old-fashioned Russian “sleeper,” someone who could be useful in an “influence campaign.”   > The sources, who range from former arms dealers to former spies — and also Hoffenberg — suggest that Epstein, who lacked any sort of moral compass, decided to go one step further and compromise influential people by recording them doing things they wouldn’t want made public.  https://edition.cnn.com/2019/07/11/middleeast/jeffrey-epstein-barak-netanyahu-israel-elections-intl",turtle_excluder,2025-05-09T05:57:30,4

His blackmail would not have carried a lot of leverage. How could he expose people for participating in his weirdo sex stuff without… also exposing himself? Blackmail is messy.

Even if me - the person - cannot, I’ve always had this ability to walk through say the hospital doors where I stop existing and the professional version of me exists until I walk out of those doors again.

How else do you get some of the most backstabbing power-hungry people in the world to actually look out for one another and work together? I think it’s sort of like a gang initiation.

"This is the level-headed take. There's no actual evidence that Epstein was blackmailing anyone. The vast, vast majority of the girls trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell were solely abused by Epstein, and many of the girls testified that he would videotape their ""interviews"" which was long suspected to be how he would catalog his favorites. These tapes exist for narcissistic reasons, not for pragmatic ones.  The parties where they were handed out as party favors were few and far between by comparison. It's extremely unlikely that any of those encounters would have been taped. They still happened and were still monstrous and Trump was absolutely present and absolutely abused children at some of these parties, but it's highly likely that we'll only ever have victim and witness testimony as evidence.",gdshaffe,2025-05-09T06:55:04,2

He couldn’t expose “the tapes” by leaking them publicly or reporting them to the authorities without exposing himself. Like you said, any compromising stuff Epstein held onto was mutual assured destruction *at best* from Epstein’s perspective. It’s not how he was bankrolling himself.  There are other practical issues. A lone dude, extorting money from multiple upper echelon billionaires? That simply does not sound sustainable. He would have been disappeared decades ago.

"Yeah, that's fair. I want people to be mad, but mad about real shit, and I find when you straight up say ""your thing is wrong"" people 100% dig in deeper. I want to give them the tools to go ""actually you're right, I overstepped my point.""  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I just try to not be the stereotypical argumentative Internet asshole, even though we all are sometimes lol",weed_blazepot,2025-05-09T09:35:10,0

"I mean yeah, but thats not realistic. The people who are investigating this stuff are bound to come across it. Having real life applications for AI to significantly reduce the amount they have to see is inherently a good thing.",PatonPaytonPeyton,2025-05-09T02:20:29,7

Calling someone antiforeigner…. As you defend the actual antiforeigners… that’s rich,cmoore9693,2025-05-09T13:17:56,1
I have rarely had such an unpleasant interaction with someone who I generally agree with.    I guess that's pretty on-brand for an ex-cop though. . .  Congratulations.,lordagr,2025-05-09T03:29:14,7
Sure or you could just give a source to back up the claims you’re making like any reasonable person would normally do,Bdbru13,2025-05-09T14:24:26,3

"I mean yea in that sense, but when you call him a part of the trafficking ring it makes it sound like he’s in the inner circle participating rather than a tool who would’ve been used by the actual elites   Is it? Is it wild to think that 4 alleged victims with major red flags lied? Or is it maybe wilder to believe that there’s a pedophile ring for elites   Roughly 200 victims. 195 of them tell extremely similar stories   4 of them tell different stories involving other high profile individuals, and each of them have severe red flags or credibility issues.  There’s really not a strong foundation of evidence to back it up",Bdbru13,2025-05-09T12:03:32,0
I Do Not Care. I said I pray for whoever has to watch it.   This isnt a debate on the exact figures and seconds they have to watch. I dont wish that on my worst enemy and AI isnt that advanced to where they can just blindly pick out child porn without any human having eyes on it. Especially because its probably not even all digital. The simple fact that they KNOW there is tens of thousands of the stuff confirms that someone has seen and verified it. I pray for that persons soul and sanity.  If you want to argue...my praying for them...and look on the bright side of watching any amount of child porn...I don't know what to tell you.,Responsible-Lunch815,2025-05-09T06:52:19,-1

"I never said anything about you praying for people, what are you talking about?  The difference is that im coming from a rational place and you are coming from an emotional one.  Have a good day",PatonPaytonPeyton,2025-05-09T12:30:57,1
"Then he is diminishing the crime by failing to mention that the abuse is sexual in nature.   He doesn't need to be the word police.  ----  When you hear the term ""child porn"" you know exactly what crime was committed.  When you hear ""evidence of child abuse"" you do not.  If he wants to advocate for another phrase, it should probably be ""child sexual abuse materials"" because at least that tells you the nature of the crime.  ----  In any case, it would be a noble goal if I actually believed his justification, but go look at his first post again.  He wasn't advocating for the use of his preferred phrasing, he was *correcting* another poster who used the same phrase that the article does, and used it correctly.  He isn't being an advocate by saying there is ""no such thing"" as child porn.  That simply isn't true.",lordagr,2025-05-09T04:40:36,2

I did. Did you not even read the my words before you replied? Or are you just here to be a spokesperson for AI? ,Responsible-Lunch815,2025-05-09T13:44:15,1

"You replied to:  >Lol you still gotta check it  Which is in the overall context of the previous post, that I pray for those that do. That's the whole point of a thread.

">Naw thats not how it works. My point was about someone needing to check it....less.  that someone that I'm praying for? I said **whoever**. Arguing semantics is pointless.  What do you have against religion?  >And you still haven't. Ironic that you are the one projecting about poor reading comprehension  You said it twice:  ""**For sure. But** let's say it eliminates 80% of the shit hes gotta look at. That's still a win""  ""I mean **yeah, but** thats not realistic.""
