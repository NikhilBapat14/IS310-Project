"> Choudri is pushing Newsom and lawmakers to consider a program that would eventually commit the state to paying back private investors, possibly with interest. That would give the state more time to cover the cost.  Remember, this is how stupid the rich think you are.",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-04-30T17:32:06,13
"Seems like the main setbacks are they underestimated the cost, fighting with existing rail carriers and some farmers keep bringing up lawsuits because they will lose property. Now I get it, and it sucks for them, but something like this is exactly what eminent domain is for.  Having an actual rail service going up the coasts and east and west connecting the US would amazing. It's projects like this that we don't do anymore because they are hard.  To quote one of my favorite monologues:  >Men build things, then we die. It's in our fucking DNA!     >That's what we do!      >And when it all falls down?     >We build it right back up again.     >But this time bigger. BETTER!     >Look! Look what we can do. Look how fuckin' beautiful we are. You think the men that built all this had it easy?     >Hard men!     >Doing hard shit! --Boondock Saints 2",ianrl337,2025-04-30T17:44:34,4
"This entire project should be put on hold until California solves the regulatory issues that made it impossible to build in the first place.  17 years and over 20 billion dollars without a single mile finished. The segment that runs through LA hasn't even passed environmental review yet.   Their new plan was to have only the segment that runs through the central valley operational by 2031 but they admit even that's not going to be possible now.  The French state-owned company that was originally attached to this project gave up in frustration, even they weren't used to this kind of bureaucracy. They instead chose to start a project in Morrocco which they described as ['less politically dysfunctional'](https://www.businessinsider.com/french-california-high-speed-rail-north-africa-biden-trump-2022-10) than California. They finished that project in 7 years.  We can't let this project become the poster child for every other HSR plan in the US. Everyone is going to point to this as the reason we can't fund any new projects. Defund it and give that money to a state that doesn't criminalize development instead.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-04-30T18:39:16,3

A Boondock Saints 2 quote is a rare thing.  Nice work.,jsreyn,2025-04-30T18:58:09,1
"> Seems like the main setbacks are they underestimated the cost,  By nearly 400% and nearly a decade in delays. That's not something you can just gloss over. If you hired a contractor and he underestimated the job by 4x, you'd be really pissed about it.",invertedspheres,2025-04-30T17:50:19,1
"> Having an actual rail service going up the coasts  If only it was.  Unfortunately it's not going up the coast, it's going up the middle of CA in the Central Valley.  It's like having a train that starts in Washington DC, goes way out into farm country and skips Baltimore, Philly, etc., then comes back to connect to NYC.",banksy_h8r,2025-04-30T17:59:39,-2
I collect great monologs in a big playlist. This is one of the best. I cut off the last line in case some could get offended.,ianrl337,2025-04-30T19:38:58,1
How about if you hired a contractor and then your city councilman down the street changed the building code and two other neighbors sued you?  4x would be passed easily.,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-30T18:15:53,7
"Right, but costs and delays are from lawsuits and inflation because it has taken so long. If we just said ""we are doing it now"" and get it done costs don't skyrocket as much.",ianrl337,2025-04-30T18:10:22,6
"Itâ€™s not like traveling up the coast or along the sierras would be cheaper or in more populated areas. At least the Central Valley has major cities in it. Frankly, the Central Valley would be a better housing market if CAHSR actually kept going north and connected to Sacramento.",Reverend-Keith,2025-04-30T18:04:38,3
"By the coast I mean CA/OR/WA through or near the main cities. Hit LA, San Fran, Sacremento, Eugene, Portland, etc. Not right up the coast, the terrain there makes it impossible and most cities are far inland after San Francisco",ianrl337,2025-04-30T18:09:28,2
