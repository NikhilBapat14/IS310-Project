Americans are even more sexist than they are racist. We elected a Black man before we elected a woman. And anyone who watched election coverage in the weeks leading up to November of 2024 saw plenty of swing state voters — including POC — openly tell journalists that they wouldn't vote for a woman president. Honestly in retrospect Dems were cooked in 2023 when Biden said he was running for a second term instead of simply claiming victory over Trump and Covid and riding off into the sunset.

I'd be more impressed if he had the self-reflection to realize that he held a great deal of responsibility for the loss by trying to hang on for a second term rather than getting the hell out of the way for a legitimate primary.,Shoehorse13,2025-05-09T20:11:17,249
"""I was disappointed but not surprised,"" Biden said. He went on to suggest sexism and racism played a role in her defeat: ""They went the sexist route.""  ""I've never seen quite as successful and consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country, and a woman of mixed race,"" he said.",Englishladyaesthetic,2025-05-09T17:24:17,239

I'm so fucking annoyed about the consistent effort of establishment Dems to paint this loss as a result of running a woman of color and not a deeply unpopular centrist who wouldn't separate from the existing party structure.   It's so frustrating to see a party that has consistently and constantly lost ground in every area of the country to grasp at straws for why their candidates aren't winning instead of just acknowledging the fact that they aren't governing effectively enough for the people that vote for them.   But instead they'll just put up another old ass white dude because they think America can't take anything else and then be shocked when they lose again because they can't actually offer a vision of the future that appeals to anyone.,Rectalcactus,2025-05-09T22:45:26,82

"I’m gonna push back a bit.  Yes, there are people in America who are racist and sexist. Also, water is wet.  But FFS, Kamala decided to not talk about the policies that were progressive in nature (price caps, $5K child tax credit) not too long after she announced them. In addition, she got scared of Tim Walz’s popularity once he became a darling for rightly calling Republicans / MAGA “weird.” Sadly, she was afraid of him outshining her due one reason or another, and Walz wasn’t leveraged as effectively as he could have been.  In my view, Kamala definitely got a great boost out the gate, and would have won if the election were held after the first debate.

"We also don't appreciate being told who's going to be the next president without a primary.

Biden needs to STFU. He handicapped Harris by running when everyone knew he wasn't capable. Preventing a primary. Not endorsing her right away and demanding that she stick to his record.,ChiBeerGuy,2025-05-10T08:15:09,7
"Okay, sure, the sole reason Harris lost was because she was a woman.   Mind you, the polling indicated that Harris performed better than Biden would have done (if he stayed in the race), and ***she got more popular votes than anyone else other than Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024. She got more votes than Obama ever did, more than Hillary, and more than GW Bush ever got.***   Harris lost because she ran a centrist, status-quo campaign that appealed to...no one.   If Biden wanted Harris to win, he would have swallowed his ego and told her to go out on the campaign field and trash him up the wazoo. Instead, she went paraded around with the Cheneys and Mark Cuban and proudly claimed she wouldn't have done anything different than Biden. That's a sure fire way to win!  Also, one of the things that really pissed me off about her campaign was that she actually polled the highest around the time when Walz made that ""weird"" comment about JD Vance. People loved that...finally a Democrat with a thick skin who has the ability to go on the offense and fight. But that doesn't fit in the with the Democrats ""when they go low, we go high"" BS, so he got shut out.   Democrats (not just Harris) really need to work on their messaging and realize that humans are creatures that play off of emotion. You just can't go around touting the economy under Biden (even though it was performing well) by explaining the low unemployment rate or the record number of jobs added, when working class Americans are working two jobs and still barely making ends meet. They want you to sympathize with them.   That's an area that Republicans do really well. They sympathize with people (look at how bad the economy is!) and then blame the wrong cohort (the economy is bad because of illegal immigrants! We need to deport them all!).   Of course, you really won't see a Democrat do this, because they can't blame the real culprit (power hungry corporations) because then they would alienate a key donor cohort.",walkallover1991,2025-05-09T17:31:44,37
"While I'm sure misogyny had some role to play, Harris's policies and her unwillingness to distance herself from Biden were the primary reasons why she lost. She also had some horrible answers to softball questions when interviewed on mainstream media. I think it's reductive to place the blame of her loss solely on the bigotry of Americans.",earhere,2025-05-09T22:54:16,12
"Okay. Dems that lose need to disappear. No more media. No more Hillary Clinton. No more Biden. No more Kamala. And no Dem should ever do The View. These are the worst moves Dems could make. Whoever advised him to do this should be named, shamed, and fired. They do not want to win. Fire them.   He has no credibility. The View has no credibility. These moves are sabotage.

She then had very little time to form an effective campaign, had the baggage of being VP to an administration with a big scandal (Biden's debate performance and his subsequent dropping out), and then stood behind that admin.

In my mind the only explanation for the male Latino vote swinging so far to trump would be sexist attitudes towards women being in charge.

"I find Biden's comment was very shortsighted. Harris wasn't defeated due to sexism. After all, back in 2016 Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the national election, and she likely would have won the electoral vote too if it weren't for her not campaigning harder due to vastly underestimating Trump's influence. Not everyone liked Hillary, but a majority did, and she was a very successful politician.  I think a few things that hurt Harris were:   1) Biden waiting until the last minute to pull out of the race, which didn't give her much time to put together her own campaign.   2) Biden's loss of popularity toward the end of his term. Historically, VPs running for president are less likely to be successful if the president they served with was unpopular.   3) Harris failing to distinguish herself from Biden. Biden pretty much let the country run itself toward the end, she needed to show everyone that she was motivated to address important issues affecting the country and convince everyone that she was someone who could get things done.   4) Harris didn't have plans in place how to solve critical issues such as immigration or energy.   5) Harris doesn't have as good of personality as many other women currently in politics.

You can definitely say that *some* of the US isn’t racist or sexist. You *can’t* pretend that there aren’t more than enough Americans who are sexist/racist to change the election outcome.

Instead they blame the American people by calling them sexist and racist.   Harris is the reason Harris lost (along with the Democrats policies). Harris was highly under qualified for the job, regardless of her 4yrs as VP. She also had a serious problem with word salad when interviewed or speaking without a prompter. In addition, she did not come across as genuine so she did not connect with “Middle America.” Overall, she was a terrible candidate.

You just can't go around touting the economy under Biden (even though it was performing well) by explaining the low unemployment rate or the record number of jobs added, when working class Americans are working two jobs and still barely making ends meet.  I didn't give an iota about the 'economy' under Biden.  It didn't affect me in a perceptible way that was different from how it affected me under Trump.  I'd strongly argue that waaayyy too many ppl are emotionally involved with how the 'economy' is perceived to be doing despite the majority being fairly insulated from it until Trump does something to deliberately tank it like tariffs.  Therefore, given Americans' bizarre, one-sided relationship with the 'economy', I think it was logical for the Harris campaign to tout it.    All that said, Kamala Harris ran an emotional campaign.

"There were a lot of financial and political reasons Harris was the only real choice. As VP and a named member of the ticket, she had extremely high name recognition and immediate access to both the Biden campaign’s war chest and infrastructure—campaign finance laws would’ve meant anyone else would’ve had to start from scratch on a very tight timeframe. Not to mention the huge slap in the face bypassing Harris would’ve been to the black community, who are the single most reliable Dem voter base. And polling shows that Harris, despite the impacted timeline, actually substantively narrowed the gap in the swing states—there’s a real possibility had she been the candidate through a standard primary and been allowed to run the campaign she wanted instead of cosmetic touch-ups to Biden’s reelection campaign, she *might* have pulled it out. As it was she saved several senate and house seats, for all the good that’s done us now.  Honestly, this is on Biden. He couldn’t put his ego aside and be a voluntary one-term president. And any strong candidate who tried to challenge him during the primary period would be seen as betraying the party. And frankly even if Biden had stepped aside, that also carried risk—incumbency is very powerful—but there was more than enough worldwide data to show being seen as the incumbents was a *bad* thing post-COVID.",strangelyliteral,2025-05-10T00:41:37,91

This idea that one oppressed group or cause needs to agree with another is insulting to the individual and makes it seem like it’s hypocrisy to not toe the woke line in every way.   Instead, the left is really missing the only way to unite its movement which is by class. Somehow labour is not the supreme and obvious message and motif and weapon of the left like it used to be. And for good reason, both parties are bought and paid for. The only guy that did it was Bernie and he got shafted. The right is able to easily rally through it on a message of hating everyone and appealing to mug majorities. That’s really easy to get into.

They saw their opportunity to turn a great economic recovery against Biden because they knew their mentally ill and cult-addled base would repeat ANY lie they told, no matter what.  They had solidified their grip through social media.  For the last few years, the media painted the picture of us being in a looming recession under Biden that never happened.  Was the economy “great” (it was for some, including myself)?  No… but it was still pretty good, especially when looking around the world and seeing that we had one of if not the best economic recovery from COVID.  Alternate (podcasts bros, youtube, fuckbook, social media) and Legacy media turned the landscape into a minefield of deliberate misinformation specifically tailored to a republican psyop of how horrible the country is.  Then Trump got himself elected based on lies and creates all the chaos and carnage himself and blames Biden because the cult is desperate to believe and validate anything that comes out of his mouth, no matter how ridiculous it is.",airplane_porn,2025-05-10T00:32:58,16

"I'd argue that there was a lot of financial and political reasons why Harris was made to be the only choice. I don't disagree with any of your points, but if you step back and look at the bigger picture ask yourself, why was someone like Harris in that position in the first place?   Like why has the Democratic party not brought up any new leaders? Why after Biden said he was going to be a one term president didn't them Dems plan better? Why have the Dems stood against their base on every popular issue since the 90's? Globalization, the Iraq war, The Afghanistan War, Medicare For All, The Environment, Occupy, Black Lives Matter, Bernie, etc.  Harris is just the culmination of a lot of Dem policies that don't win but keep a lot of rich elites in power while offer people nothing.

"I mean if you really want to get realpolitik about it, it's on Biden for not choosing a white male VP. you're right that the black vote is the single most reliable vote demographic in the Democratic party (with the black female vote being the most reliable in particular)... but that also means that they'll still vote Democratic when the candidate is white.   if the goal is to appeal to as many Americans as possible, then you're basically playing the Price is Right with the political spectrum: choose someone who's as far right as you can possibly get and still lock down your base voters. third way white guy from Arkansas for instance? I heard he was pretty successful two times in a row...   is that what I want my Democratic party to look like? of course not. but if I'm thinking purely in terms of strategy, that's how it's done.

"> Women don’t necessarily like trans people  That’s actually not true, it’s a myth pushed by the right, that they began formulating when they switched from “these seductive trans sirens are going to trick you girlie men into enjoying cock” messaging pre-2015 (remember when we were “traps”?) to the much more effective “YOUR DAUGHTERS YOUR DAUGHTERS YOUR DAUGHTERS” messaging that has been used against a every minority ever since the dawn of civilization.  Women are generally the most supportive demographic of trans folk, and the most supportive within other demographics, and among the broader LGBT+ community lesbians are the most supportive of the T, at least more so than gay men, again generally speaking. (The LGBT+ community has its own politics and neither the bloc itself nor constituent groups are monoliths)  > Black people don’t have to be into LGBT, and why should they?  Because there are black LGBT+ people, dude. I’m not saying it isn’t organic, but a lot of the “that f*ggot stuff is white nonsense/for white people” etc and appeals to conspiracy theories (“they’re pushing trans to emasculate our men”) is being again heavily pushed by the right. Just look at how the Trump campaign designed an entire commercial push around Charlamagne tha God talking shit about trans people and when the surgery for immigrants issue came up.  > Throwing the largest segments of the population under the bus   The Democrats aren’t throwing anyone “mainstream” under the bus.  Kamala stripped all mention of trans people from her campaign materials, and especially after the convention treated the entire issue as a third rail, and the party followed suit by rewriting all of its messaging to “love is love” (and that’s all they’re going to say).   LGBT issues, especially trans issues, are what they threw under the bus. Did you see the Democratic National Convention? Last year, the first ever open trans woman ran for (and won, thank you) a federal elected office. She was at the convention. Not only did she not get to speak, no one mentioned her existence and she wasn’t even on MSNBC or whatever. They gave the token gay speaking slot to Pete Buttigieg, who is clearly the model of the kind of LGBT+ person the Democratic Party wants to put forward: Unchallenging, deferential to cishets, a “property values” gay who fits into suburban white life as a kind of court eunuch to hang around with the democrat-voting wives of Republican dentists.  Your post here is emblematic of the problem: The Democrats allowed transphobia from candidates (Allred, Brown) and demonstrated a willingness to consider abandoning us for supposed electoral benefit, after remaining silent on the actual issues all through the campaign.  The Democrats have completed surrendered the information space around these issues to the point that even the meta-narrative around campaign framing is full of right wing talking points around the issue like the ones you’re repeating.",CatgirlApocalypse,2025-05-10T05:08:39,3

A lot of people don’t want to get behind someone like that because they wouldn’t ever stick around after if it happened to them personally.  Kamala was a terrible choice. She did awful in the 2020 primaries and was one of the least popular of all the options. Just because she became vice president and got a free ride onto the ticket soured a lot of people views of her too.  She filled jails as a prosecutor for marijuana related charges in California and then 180’d into a heavy left agenda. Who wants to get behind someone like that?  Put a decent woman up, and majority wouldn’t have a problem with the sex. Sure, there’s a few of course. But imo not nearly as many as people are making it out to be. The truth is that those 2 woman were absolutely terrible choices. Bernie should have been president in 2016 but he was robbed of that by the democrat party.

If a populace votes for a candidate that proposes xenophobic policies, that is a reflection of their negative feelings towards immigrants.  If a populace votes for a candidate that makes outrageous economic promises that he immediately fails to fulfill within only a day of being in office, that is a reflection of their comprehension of the economy.   If a populace votes for a candidate who proudly admitted to sexually harassing women, was a close friend of prominent sex trafficker, and was found liable for sexual abuse, that is a reflection of their feelings towards women.  If a populace votes for a candidate who promoted racist conspiracies about a black leader and called for the execution of five black men for a crime they were exonerated of, that is a reflection of their feelings towards black people.  Stop babying voters, as if such people aren’t grown men and women who can clearly conceive the world around them and should know right from wrong.  We can absolutely blame the voters. Sure, that doesn’t mean the Democrats did their campaign perfectly and they lost solely because America is still dealing with deep rooted racism, sexism, and so on. But let’s not call a duck a horse.

"Harris was not exactly elevated to her status for the purpose of being candidate for a top leadership position. She was picked as VP to shore up any demographics that Biden could not effectively represent or garner support from. The Vice Presidency is traditionally an inconsequential role outside of recent times. She was a niche choice that was effective in one particular scenario: helping Biden get elected with Biden at the head of the ticket, and she never grew beyond that like the Biden team was probably hoping for in the 11th hour when he dropped out of the Presidential race. Normally, even in the democratic party, you'd get some semblance of a marketplace of ideas with candidates competing against on the campaign stage to see what ideas or vibes win out.  Harris ran in 2024 just on blind hope and desperation that it was the best move under short notice and that she was popular enough, not based on any proven track record that would have been borne from the results of running the gauntlet in a traditional Presidential race. Yes, Biden was a VP pick so why was he more popular? Because while Biden was chosen most cynically to compliment Obama on a campaign ticket, the way Biden complimented Obama's representation and values on the ticket was different to how Harris had to compliment Biden's representation and values. One scenario led to a VP with broad appeal and the other lead to a VP with niche appeal.",statu0,2025-05-10T07:05:13,14

Fast forward a few years after that, I had a terrible pain in my toe where I couldn't sleep. Once again, I was told by medical professionals it wasn't gout. I ordered my own blood test for uric acid. It was gout. I have been on medication and no flare up since. I did my own research and it worked out. One has to be their own advocate at times. They aren't just limited to their specific field. Law is similar. I decided not to attend law school (I didn't want the debt), but I was able to handle my own legal documents numerous times without issues when an attorney I was speaking with was wrong. I was correct and an issue worked out. Truth is objective and those with the credentials have the highest probability of finding it, but that doesn't mean others can't.

"> I think they understand what their voters want they just don't want to do it. For example: Voters want Congress to be unable to buy and sell stocks. Progressives try and pass those bills and Republicans and Democrats shoot them down. You want people to think your party isn't corrupt? Then lead the way on corruption, lobbyist rules, and election reform.  I get what you are saying and let me elaborate my point better. While it is true that there are issues like this where there is a clear and dominant opposition to a policy from the voters' point of view that the party does not adopt as part of the platform because they have a vested interest in maintaining it because it benefits them personally, there are still issues that the democrats support that would win voters over IF they could actually convince them or get through to them that they support these things. This especially applies to certain basic economic policies like not wanting inflation or tariffs so we can have a stable market system and a functioning economy. There is also a way to tell people what they want to hear while doing something entirely different. That's what the GOP has done, and obviously I don't want democrats to lie and completely misrepresent their platform, but they definitely could highlight stuff that they do want to do that intersects with what the voters want much better. And those policies exist. It's not just the fact that the democratic leadership wants to do something diametrically opposed to the will of the voters. The intersection of interests just happens to not get focused on because the leadership has become so out of touch and are spending too much time doing the background work on actual policy instead of messaging and having infights about the direction of the party. Also, the right has appropriated and tainted a lot of the traditional vocabulary used by people on the left to rally voters to their side. And the democrats need to figure out a way around that.  >It always feels like they are saying to the base: ""Look we did what you wanted now shut up"" That undercuts their messaging.  This only feels this way because voters don't feel positive change and then it is being reinforced by right wing commentators and politicians. Democrats say rightfully that it is the GOP's fault that their policies aren't working, but what actually matters is what will convince the voter to continue to vote for you, so they should not be focusing on what has already been done for them. An educated voter will realize that there is a reason to both reiterate policy that is already good and then say we need to follow it up, but people casually involved in politics will not have the context to understand that, and the focus on existing good policy will feel condescending because they will make a comparison to how it has positively affected them personally, which ends up not being much, or not at all. It doesn't matter if there hasn't been enough time for it to work. It doesn't matter if it needs to be supported with other policies to be effective. The complexities just bounce right off.  >Yes, Democrats have a messaging problem. That's in part because they have no credibility.  If credibility was so easily lost, then why does the GOP have such a winning platform? Yes, the constituency is a lot different. Specifically, the left tends to be more educated and isn't fooled by the same kind of rhetoric, but the main issue that the messaging for democratic voters was tone deaf and lead to the appearance of lacking credibility, regardless of the facts or details, even though there is a credibility issue on the facts as well. It all feeds into each other.  >They actually listen to their base. They are scared of their voters.  Right but his all came after the messaging got away from the old leadership in the GOP and took on a mind of its own. Then they adapted to it, and tried to steer it, successfully to a degree. Even if they don't have full control, they have been slowly guiding the trajectory of the culture of right-wing voters even if they can't make dramatic shifts in ideological beliefs in a short period of time. Basically, the evangelical, theological authoritarian side had to fight for influence in Trump's autocratic vision.",statu0,2025-05-10T17:51:35,1

"For the record, what does holding people accountable for voting do? In a presidential election, or any election, the point is to influence the voters and capture the pressing issues that they care about. We can sit behind a screen all day and call people who voted for Trump idiots, but we’re ignoring the bigger underlying issues that caused that in the first place.   To put it bluntly, blaming voters is a stance that lacks nance and critical thinking. It’s paramount to a business blaming their customers for not buying into a new product.

">Dementia doesn’t work that way. My gran had it. It’s a degenerative disease that quite quickly makes a person unable to talk.  It progressing this quickly isnt actually the norm, 8-10 years is the norm and 10-20 isn't that rare. There are many stages and it is not at all uncommon for it to take over a decade for the worst symptoms to be present and even longer before they go non verbal. My grandfather's symptoms started being noticeable when I was in middle school and he didn't get to the point where he struggled to recognize anyone but his wife until I was almost graduated from college.   It doesn’t make them a “crazy fucker”, at least past the very early stages.  My grandfather would go off on random tangents, fixate on things, and rant about random shit that would randomly rile him up. This was 6-8 years before he was completely confused. The fact is they were giving him cognitive assessments over 5 years ago and they don't do that unless they have good reason to think you might have an issue and there is no reason to believe him when he says he passed them. Trump's father died with dementia at 93 and had well documented decline for at least 7 years before he died. The fact of the matter is Trump is very clearly suffering some level of cognitive decline and though it has been common knowledge for a long time, cognitive decline is not actually a normal part of aging , so his cognitive decline would have to be from something like dementia or he has had a stroke or something. The progressive nature and other signs point more towards dementia.",OskaMeijer,2025-05-09T21:39:25,5
