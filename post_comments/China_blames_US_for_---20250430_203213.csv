Say what you will about stewart and colbert but this rant by stewart about covid is on point¬†   https://youtu.be/sSfejgwbDQ8?si=clfXZjyeZTzZcLMt,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-30T21:24:24,58
Welllll....Fauci did fund it...so in a way they're not 100% wrong.,Kahnspiracy,2025-04-30T23:18:32,41

"> The communist regime argued that ‚Äúsubstantial evidence‚Äù suggested that COVID might have come from the US earlier than the outbreak in China while insisting the lab leak theory was ‚Äúextremely unlikely‚Äù [in a white paper](http://english.scio.gov.cn/whitepapers/2025-04/30/content_117854036_3.html).  > ...The report also claimed **COVID-19 was circulating around the US earlier than it was officially determined.** ... China stressed in the white paper that according to a past joint study conducted with the World Health Organization, it found COVID-19 was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal.    Wow, that's uh, a take on the sequence of events, given that nobody else reported U.S.   nontravel‚Äìrelated (aka ""community spread"") COVID-19 cases earlier than February 26, 2020",Kv603,2025-04-30T20:49:05,25

"That's not even good Chinese propaganda.  It's just lazy.  I prefer the normal Chinese anti-American propaganda where they make our country look like a badass heavy metal album, with fire breathing bald eagles and a machine-gun toting skeleton-lady liberty on a motorcycle jumping over an exploding tank driven by a cigar smoking Donald Trump with flames for hair and bullets for teeth and an American flag cape.",cathbadh,2025-04-30T21:01:10,14
"That is not what the article says, but if they had claimed US culpability, they wouldn't be completely wrong. It leaked from a lab in China that was doing research paid for by American tax dollars. We are kind of both to blame - them for sucking at maintaining a sterile lab environment, and us for funding dangerous research.",moashforbridgefour,2025-05-01T00:28:48,11

"I'm mean, tbf I'm surprised the rest of the world isn't pissed at us. Did the USA illegally fund dangerous research in a foreign adversarys country allow it to infect the world, and sell the vaccine to the world for a profit? It kinda seems that way",fordr015,2025-05-01T02:04:47,1

"Wait!  If people learn America was funding research in China on the COVID virus then that would mean a whole bunch of scientists in upper management at the US government scientific institutes were responsible for setting up the point of failure and would lose their cushy government funding and jobs.

Country that lies and is known for propaganda and enslaving their own citizens through wage suppression tells lies and propaganda to their enslaved population. More news at 11.   Sounds like they‚Äôre to push the divide between China and the US further.,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-01T08:29:37,7

They're feeling a lot of pressure from the tariffs so they are trying to distract their population.,Kahnspiracy,2025-05-01T11:04:34,1
"I agree with you about our tax dollars being extorted from us and then misappropriated for gain of function research.   However, IMO you might want to choose a different allegory than Pilate washing his hands for yourself. Pilate still agreed to crucify Jesus to mollify the Jewish leaders who clamored for his death. The gesture of washing his hands after proclaiming Jesus‚Äô fate was a Jewish tradition and, as a Roman, said act was only paying lip service. I know that the phrase ‚Äúwashed my hands of it‚Äù does mean a claim of innocence, but claiming directly to be Pilate is a murky interpretation/extrapolation of that at best.   A better allegory might be Jesus‚Äôs righteous anger at the money changers in the temple. In this case, anger against those who mis-spent our money on dangerous ventures to be handled by those of questionable repute might be a better fit.",docholiday999,2025-05-04T14:31:58,2
