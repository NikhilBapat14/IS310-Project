The move comes as the Trump administration has considered disbanding the agency. Hurricane season starts June 1,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-05-08T13:27:53,46
Trump/Musk want to impound as much money as possible for their own personal use.,insuproble,2025-05-08T13:30:10,18
He's on the record saying that a hurricane is the problem of whatever state it hits. Governors should be knocking down the White House door. Why pay federal taxes.,uncwil,2025-05-08T13:38:20,16
"No ""great job, Brownie"" for this president. Interestingly, the 2005 Katrina aftermath was the underwater submersion point for the Republican 2nd term presidency of W. Bush.",localistand,2025-05-08T13:37:57,11
Sarah Huckabee Sanders still whining about not getting Federal disaster funds... from the guy she passionately voted for.   I'd bring up the leopards but... they are still trying to get approved for Ozempic.,williamgman,2025-05-08T14:04:00,6
It's going to be hilarious watching the MAGA goblins of Cousin Lovin' County wonder where their disaster aid is when their Florida trailer courts are flooded during the next big hurricane.,Chazhoosier,2025-05-08T18:38:24,2

"If you want federal aid for your state after getting ravaged by a natural disaster, you’re going to have to come to the White House and offer three things:  1. Public fealty, ring kissing, and praise 2. Some statewide political/economic concession that aligns with White House goals 3. Meme coin bribe under the table directly to Trump’s pockets.  Welcome to hell. My only suggestion is to move away from the coast if your Governor is going to fight it.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-08T13:39:44,25
"He isn't worried about Hurricanes. He knows he can just change the path with a sharpie. In fact, he is wondering why all these other presidents let hurricanes cause so much damage instead of using their sharpie.",SomeDEGuy,2025-05-08T13:30:40,15

It's the only way Donald Trump knows how to run government and why these global tariffs exist. Far too many people were either fine with a mob boss president or too uninformed to care.,Orange8920,2025-05-08T14:25:25,6
