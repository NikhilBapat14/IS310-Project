I don’t want Resistance 2.0. I want Dems to go on offense.,Not_A_Comeback,2025-04-30T16:05:10,10
"I think the Democratic party needs to fracture in two, where the real progressives can shake off the old Blue Dogs still running the party.  I honestly don't believe the Democratic party has a future. But hopefully, some thing better and with greater integrity can rise from the ashes.",endemicstupidity,2025-04-30T16:07:52,2

That would be one way to give Republicans supermajorities in the House and Senate.,TurboSalsa,2025-04-30T16:19:12,7
"Two things need to happen for a truly progressive wing to rise from the ashes IMO:   1. The GOP needs to start eating itself, which I'm sure we'll see plenty of in the next 4 years. They're too unified rn. They haven't really felt the pressure yet.  2. The Dems need to drop Israel. It's a weight shackled to their leg that will forever cost them progressive votes. Anyone Left of Center younger than 40 sees Israel for what it is: a fascist, xenophobic state built on genocide. The sooner the old guard realizes that or dies, the better.",mob19151,2025-04-30T17:08:23,4

So things dems are already doing,Complete-Pangolin,2025-05-01T10:14:56,1
yes. those are all fantastic. the generate more followers and higher approval ratings. beleive it or not authoritarian regimes cannot function when so many of the general population hates them AND there's a way better alternative out there. the actions taken by all those i mentioned are showing us that better alternative.,Throwaway123454th,2025-04-30T16:45:26,0
not really just those ones i mentioned.. maybe a couple others in the house. they ALL need to do this stuff. their voices need to be amplified 1000%.,Throwaway123454th,2025-05-01T12:44:55,0
