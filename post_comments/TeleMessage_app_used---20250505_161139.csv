"Breaches? That shit was given to Russia with a newly minted username and password.  I half joke but some national data was moved out of a secure server through startlink exactly like that. If they did that and we only know because they were caught and exposed by a whistle blower, imagine all the things given over that we don’t know about.  Just so happens a few of doge top people and our own SoD are Russian linked. Not hard to assume most of our data has been sold to Russia if not outright given to them.",AcidRohnin,2025-05-05T16:31:59,5
