I am a California Democrat  and I want her to replace wishy-washy right-sliding Newsom.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-01T16:52:17,14

California already has a corporate governor.  Maybe she can run in her co-campaigner Liz Cheney's state.,MentalTourniquet,2025-05-01T16:25:46,5
"Yeah, their opinion is pretty accurate. If she runs for a different office, she'll have a better platform. If she runs for president again she will be ignored.     I hope that her message will be about helping the working class, and not those other topics that have been stealing our thunder from our winning left-wing economic policies.",hendrixski,2025-05-01T16:15:00,1

"As a moderate voter in California, I don't give a shit about Kamala Harris or whoever. If you are against MAGA cucks, then you have my vote. MAGA voices need to be kept in the confines of Facebook groups and Nextdoor. Not California state offices.",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-05-02T01:30:57,0
"Harris will be 72 in November 2036. A bit on the older side, but still young enough to run for President in that year. Particularly if she has two successful terms as CA governor at her back, she would still be a strong candidate.  I can see why it is a tough decision for her, but that seems like the better move than running for President in 2028 after she has been out of office for four years. People right now are craving someone new.",gradientz,2025-05-01T16:15:13,-6
She is just as wishy-washy right-sliding. Her refusal to to push back against trans attacks during the campaign was pretty Gavin like.,veruca_seether,2025-05-01T17:12:07,12
"Just curious does the stink only apply to women who have lost?   Seeing as Trump lost in 2020 and didn’t go away. Hell, the entire Republican slate is filled with multi-time losers.",Former-Counter-9588,2025-05-01T16:42:35,6

"Not that I'm trying to downplay trans rights, but there are genuinely more pressing issues politicians need to attend to. Homelessness, housing crisis, climate crisis, the fact that we're likely to dip into a full-on recession by the end of the year if Trump keeps Trumping.",southernfirefly13,2025-05-01T17:19:31,-6

It's being a woman and Harris is a woman of color. Why she lost.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-01T16:53:00,-5

"""Trans people aren't important enough""   Oh great, so we should just default to letting conservatives attack a minority group? That certainly hasn't been the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the issues you listed throughout history.",No_Interaction4042,2025-05-01T17:44:07,3
Yeah sorry but no. Trans rights are just as more as those issues. And the fact that you would say such a thing is insulting.,veruca_seether,2025-05-01T18:42:06,3
"I’m a woman and it’s more than that- like Hillary Harris is unrelatable- she’s awkward and more of an elite like Hillary- I voted for her bc she was better than the other choice but she’s not likeable and not winnable. I don’t like newsom either- he’s an out of touch elitist too. We need someone like Walz who sends thier kids to public school and can relate to the working middle class, who actually cares about the working middle class.",void-cat-181,2025-05-01T17:01:09,2
"It's really annoying that people reduce the fact that Kamala lost because she's a woman. Sexism played a minor part in it, but it overlooks the fact that she was NEVER a popular candidate to begin with in either one of her campaigns.",southernfirefly13,2025-05-01T17:24:23,3
"If you have free and fair election in 2028, I hope she becomes secretary of Treasury. Be it in 2028 or 32. No matter who's the president",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-01T21:25:20,1
"Pretty much the same. Started off solid only to quickly slide to the right.  Since she's lost the election, there's no reason to bullshit about her character. She's no leader. She's a career politician whose values are formed by the wind and policy advisors that haven't won an election since Clinton administration. She actually stands for nothing and she has a charisma of used tissue.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-01T20:46:36,1

Do not let perfection be the enemy of the best available. By that logic you would prefer not to vote for the best candidate available in the hopes that some better one that doesn't exist comes along and earns your vote. This is one of the key reasons why Democrats keep losing. Self-inflicted wounds.,ManiaGamine,2025-05-01T17:48:40,8

"You're trying to quote me on things I never said, and that's both ignorant and unfair.  I fully support the trans community. They deserve to be respected and treated equally, and to have their identities validated by society at large, and not to have their trans identities viewed as a mental illness that needs to be purged. But that's an issue with society as much as it's an issue with politics, and the trans community isn't the only community being attacked and rights stripped away slowly after over a decade of progress - decades for some - have regressed in just 100 days.  Trans rights are human rights and human rights will ALWAYS be necessary and important, but let's read the room. The average American cares that it's becoming increasingly unaffordable to make a living and maintain a roof over their head when literally 5 individuals control the vast majority of wealth in the nation and have effectively bought out the Presidency and turned it into an oligarchy. Not just that, but the oligarchy they've bought has systemically worked to strip away science and education, reverting all progress on improving the climate crisis and improving education and literacy to the masses, and slowly working to convert the nation into a Christo-Fascist nation that gives a rats ass about the planet and it's people all in the name of profit, all enabled by a corrupt Supreme Court and the woefully ignorant and uneducated.  Priorities.",southernfirefly13,2025-05-01T18:33:22,-5
"I thought Harris was/is fine and am eager to see her be governor of California. Much of the reason Hillary lost was sexism and with Harris, racism as well. Why exactly have we never, ever, even once had a female  President if there is no sexism in Presidential elections?  Why have we only had one President of color if there is no racism?",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-01T17:58:24,-1

Because the Uncommitted movement worked out sooo well.,bin10pac,2025-05-01T18:02:55,2
"I never said that there was no sexism in Presidential elections.  Public perception is everything in politics, regardless of truth. And by the time Trump and Hillary were both campaigning to be President, Americans on both sides of the political spectrum had already become radicalized towards the far right and far left. Trump just amplified it.  But the bottom line is that Hillary wasn't trustworthy. The hype of her being the first female Presidential candidate was correct and deserved, but while the right championed her as a hallmark moment for social progress, the right was attacking it as an attack on all women being too emotional. Between that, being the husband of Bill Clinton, and all the speculation as to how Hillary became favored by DNC as the Democratic frontrunner over Bernie Sanders, how she handled Benghazi and that bullshit laptop scandal, she had a lot working against her that contributed to 100 million eligible citizens skip voting period.   As for Kamala, she wasn't popular, period. Though she was named an early front-runner for the nomination in 2020, she dwindled in popularity by the time all the candidates began debating each other and was among the first few candidates to suspend their campaign. Her campaign for 2024 wasn't very solid, but that's on Biden and the Democratic party just as much as it is on her. She ran largely on Biden's policies instead of her own. She largely focused on what Trump was going to do and not enough on what she was going to do. Her campaign didn't allow Tim Walz to effectively campaign for her, either, and he ended up looking like a joke after he went up against JD Vance.",southernfirefly13,2025-05-01T19:16:10,1
"Tbh that was this cycles ""WalkAway"" movement. Same shit, hell some of the same people involved I suspect. Seems like that is just what is going to happen every cycle now.
