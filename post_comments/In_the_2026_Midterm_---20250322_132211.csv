I think it will be more likely that any GOP member not towing the line will be primaried by an Elon Musk funded maga Republican.,postdiluvium,2025-03-22T19:07:48,282
Not likely unless the country is in REALLY bad shape. Maga has a vice grip on the republican party. The only way to realistically get them out is with democrats.,[deleted],2025-03-22T19:11:40,81
"I honestly have no idea. One MAGA guys wife was deported and he's fine with it, and MAGA family's child died and they think ""it's not that bad"", and a MAGA veteran was cut by DOGE and is fine with it ...  So I don't know if enough people are upset.",OhWhatsHisName,2025-03-22T18:18:56,77

"Very low.  Who is their constituency?  In what state or district do these moderates outnumber both the Democratic base OR the new GOP/MAGA base?  I would argue no such place exists today.  The lack of middle-ground with VOTERS is the problem, moreso than middle-ground with politicians (most of them just want to survive another term and will compromise as much, or as little, is required to do so).  Right now, the less they compromise the more they survive.",disco_biscuit,2025-03-22T19:28:53,7
"Very weak. A large proportion of the Republicans are internally not MAGA and downright frightened by the whole thing but they're too cravenly quislingly cowardly to stand up and are waiting for it to all blow over. With a small few exceptions, non or even secretly anti Trump republicans are the most cowardly political nonforce in the country. Standing against Trump is political death so long as they cannot coordinate en mass, and even then, he breaks the party until he dies.   The optionality is therefore left at the feet of the Democrats. God help us.",Fit-Profit8197,2025-03-22T22:53:22,6
"They’ll face challenges.  Will they lose? Nope.   MAGA dominates the GOP now.

"Zero.  It's more likely that current reps that push back against Trump are primaried with money from Musk than moderates challenge MAGA.  The Republican party is MAGA and their voters are rationalizing it, not rebelling.",WisdomOrFolly,2025-03-22T19:51:09,6
"I think there will be primary challenges.  I'm going to be completely honest, I thought Donald Trump had such a stranglehold on the Republican party that I'm surprised anyone ran against him in the primaries, and he wasn't completely uncontested for the Republican nomination.  If Trump had non-MAGA primary challengers, surely there will be some of them running against incumbents next year.  But Trump wiped the floor with his challengers, and that's exactly what will happen with those Republican incumbents.  These incumbents may be vulnerable to Democratic challengers in the general election, but they will not be vulnerable in the primaries.",ANewBeginningNow,2025-03-22T22:01:40,3

Why is OP trying to pretend that intentional stupidity isn't intentional stupidity?",anti-torque,2025-03-22T21:03:33,4
I don’t see why not.  Floating the idea seems like a good thing.  I would certainly consider voting for a non-MAGA Republican or a moderate Democrat.,No-Average-5314,2025-03-22T19:43:00,2
MAGA was losing a lot since 2016. It just so happened they got the lucky break of their lives in 2024 when Biden didn't step down and a very unlikable Kamala Harris was anointed into candidacy. they'll lose big in the 2026 mid-terms.   The only real question is if the 2026 mid-term elections will be recognized.,jmsy1,2025-03-23T05:02:09,2
"Given these Republican town halls seem to be filled with angry Progressive activists and not actual MAGA or Republican voters, there doesn't seem to be a significant backlash against Trump just yet. So, no,  I wouldn't expect effective challengers to existing MAGA representatives in the next election.",ralphrainwater,2025-03-24T09:33:51,2
"Most of the vocal objectors at the town halls are Democrats and not Republicans.  I'm not sure if swing voters are going to town halls in mass or not.  I wouldn't expect them to.  So far, there has been ZERO cuts to  Social Security ,  Medicaid payments, just a Reduction in staff.  With many states going to open primaries (which I hate)   Its possible.  just kinda depends, if dems mobilize massively and the (R) voters are asleep at the wheel, they could take a few incumbents out.      Course Trump may back a few primary challenges to switch regular (R) house members to Ultra Maga candidates.       I'd be shocked if at least 2 primaries don't win,  one (D) backed and one (maga) backed.",discourse_friendly,2025-03-22T19:26:27,6
"Don't know, but even if there is a majority democratic vote the vote tally will still show the republicans winning.  At this point their control of the voting process is independent of the actual vote.",Edwardv054,2025-03-22T20:03:09,2
I think it's much more likely that any GOP incumbent that loses will say it's fraud and refuse to leave office and the current conservative courts will allow it.,SlowMotionSprint,2025-03-22T22:08:28,2
"Is there any chance that everyone will be so fed up with this bullshit that they will vote Democrat at midterms?  I am harassing my family that live in red state about this but they are not MAGA, just always voted Republican and he said he wouldn't touch social security and that's all they cared about.  They don't really care about immigration thing cause not a lot of illegal immigrants middle of nowhere Arkansas.",[deleted],2025-03-23T04:55:34,1
If DOGE delivers the promise of better technology resulting in reduction in the deficit then MAGA wins.  Republican incumbents will ride the wave.  If DOGE is discovered to be hot air with reduced services and no reduction in the deficit then MAGA loses.  Primary challenges will give Republicans an uphill battle to overcome.    I read what is being said on both sides.  I’m following the multiple lawsuits.  This cake hasn’t finished baking.,FollowingVast1503,2025-03-23T07:45:44,1
"Since the Democratic party literally ruined itself by going all in on demonizing Trump and everyone slightly right of them, I suspect the right will feel much more comfortable to start their internal struggles, and moderate Republican candidates will have a surge in popularity.

"Anti-MAGA moderates? Where might one find these? There aren't many to speak of. The Anti-Maga crowd consists of Democrats and Independents.

"It's a complete toss-up how things are going to go. It's pretty much been proven by the stats at this point that the reason Trump is in office now is because a miserable percentage of eligible democrat voters did not vote. With few exceptions, Democrats typically are lazier voters than Republicans. Possibly the one exception being when Obama was running. Same thing this time. People were too busy with other things they deemed more important and here we are today.   Yes people are disgusted and angry now, but there's not enough momentum as of this moment I think, to turn any tables in the midterms. Now, if they actually do something stupid and suspend social security for even one month, that might light some fires under people. Or do something drastically to health care that literally has an effect on millions of people immediately. But it would take something that severe I think to get people off their butts in numbers large enough to change anything in two years.",PickleManAtl,2025-03-24T02:18:59,1

Trump and MAGA have defied odds both in 2016 and more importantly in 2024.    They will take this as the typical anti incumbent wave that’s seen with every midterm.  It will only change if they lose 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032.  I used to think three election losses closes the door on a movement but Trump proved that wrong in 2024.

If the incumbent can successfully portray his primary opponent as a Musk stooge while walking the MAGA tightrope of supporting Trump but not agreeing with every single thing he is doing they may have a chance.  Musk and his actions are extremely unpopular, but at this point more so with independents than true MAGA’s.

You want horrific acts? Let’s talk about what’s been in the news. Democrats have been pushing sanctuary city nonsense, letting illegal immigrants with rap sheets roam free—take that case in New York last year where a migrant, already deported before, beat up cops and got released without bail thanks to soft-on-crime DA Alvin Bragg. That’s not just incompetence; it’s a slap in the face to every law-abiding American.  Or how about the border crisis? Biden’s crew let over 7 million cross illegally since he took office, and just last month, ICE had to admit they’ve lost track of 300,000 unaccompanied kids—some trafficked, some dead, all on Kamala’s watch as ‘border czar.’ That’s a horror show, not a policy. Then there’s the economy—Democrats rammed through that Inflation Reduction Act, and what’d we get? Inflation hitting families so hard a MAGA mom in Ohio lost her kid to overdose because fentanyl’s flooding in unchecked, and she couldn’t afford treatment. Blame the open border and Democrat inaction.  And don’t get me started on DOGE—Trump’s efficiency plan might’ve cut some veteran benefits, sure, but compare that to Democrats slashing VA funding in real terms while funneling billions to Ukraine. A vet in Texas told Fox last fall he’s waiting months for care because of it—meanwhile, Zelensky’s getting red-carpet treatment.

Buddying up to people on the right and trying to act like some kinda moderate. The problem is now the far left part of the party is pissed at him for doing so and nobody on the right is buying it.

The aircraft carriers and submarines might be nuclear powered, but the support vessels and crews are not able to operate indefinitely without resupply of fuel and consumables.  If the US is fully abandoned by other countries and restricted to basing operations from its own territory, I can see it being able to project indefinitely only in the north Pacific, and northwestern Atlantic.

"Trying to boil it down a lot:   1) Territory - The land itself isn't terribly well suited for conducting asymmetric warfare and hiding guerrillas. There are some places, but the vast majority really isn't set up for it.  2) National Pride/Tribalism - Every nation has some of this, but most 1st world nations just don't have that spark in enough people.  3) Ready Weapons - Even with hunting rifles and such, the armaments available at the get go to Canadians will be SLIM. Often this isn't terribly much a problem as they can just be smuggled in. Canada has a serious issue there with no overland routes and the US Navy, Air Force, and Space Force to reduce it further.  4) Space - You want enough space, but not too much and Canada has too much. It actually helps in tracking down where insurgents are and where they come from/get supplied from.  5) Surveillance - Canada has too much as it is, much less the full force of the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office, who run the US spy sats).  6) Personal Skills - Not only do you have to know how to fight to be a guerrilla, but you also have to know how to survive in the wilderness. A skill most 1st worlders lost long ago.  This is just a SHORT summary. I've studied Asymmetric Warfare for almost 40 years now learning first from my old SEAL Commander instructor (who was in 'Nam) in NJROTC in high School. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that a lot of the advantages that really help aren't there for Canada.   When fighting asymmetrically it's ALL about stacking every advantage you have up, hitting the weakest spot at the most vulnerable, and then disappearing before there is a reaction. The US has been dealing with that kind of fighting for 70+ years. It may not look it, but we are REALLY good at it.

"While communism was the opposite of capitalism, that doesn't mean Russia joined the same side when they abandoned communism. Russia has rightly been described as a mafia state. While the US isn't an angel, the Russians actively work to undermine many democracies around the world.  Republicans were big globalists and from a textbook economic sense it has huge upsides. Unfortunately, they did not consider the impact on workers and most people learn one trade in life. Take it away and it becomes very challenging to pick up something new. A more gradual shift in production would have helped workers do that, but the wealthy saw great opportunities in China and financed their rise in return for a couple decades of good returns.   Parties undergo shifts every couple of decades. Some are subtle and some are huge. You'll see Republicans claim to be the party of Lincoln. Technically that's true, but at that time the Republicans were dominant in the northern states. What happened? Lyndon Johnson, a Democratic President from Texas in the 1960s, said it was time to recognize civil rights. Major parts of the Democratic party, mostly that dominated a racist south, did not care for that and shifted parties. The Republicans have had a stranglehold on the south ever since.  MAGA wants to bring all the manufacturing back. While some of that makes sense, there are good reasons to produce some things elsewhere because the work involves low value-added jobs that pay low wages like making sneakers or the manufacturing processes can be very detrimental to health like chromium production. People forget that in the 1970s the US had some serious issues - lakes and rivers catching fire and then Love Canal.  Anti-intellectualism should scare everybody. I will partially agree with you that universities have become big business and that has created problems. That's different from Republicans criticizing universities for being too liberal. My classmates recall no professors or otherwise spouting a liberal woke agenda. What we remember is arriving from predominantly WASP high schools and meeting interesting people of color, people from different nationalities, and people with different perspectives that over the course of several years made us realize as different as they were, inside most just wanted the exact same things. Living in isolation, strict church, small town, or rural farm rarely leads to interactions that result in understanding. That's what for all their problems turns urban centers blue.  The issue with Trump is that if you look at his prior circle probably 50% of his staff have said he was unfit for office. He has too many foibles to be a fair President, let alone a good President. While many of his constituents say they want to burn it all down and I share some of the frustration, is starting again from a smoldering heap going to produce anything better? The answer historically is no. Not only are we victims of the human condition but burning it down is exactly what the Russians have been wanting.",PennStateInMD,2025-03-25T05:22:35,2

"That's very interesting. I can see from what youre telling me that the two parties have switched once more. With the left now serving  the benefit of the super wealthy who prosper from globalism( if only in the short term) and the right now supporting populism and the middle class. So it makes sense that our education system would try to protect what the super wealthy want.  Because I dont see Russia destroying democracies. Ukraine, with a dictator like Zelinsky, who killed an American journalist for speaking out against him, and who will not even let his people vote is certainly no democracy. Doubt forget, we handed Afghanistan to the Taliban. In fact Obama is responsible for Arab Spring. I see this as an excuse. This makes no sense to me. We are the biggest Mafia State there is. China is the second biggest. This is not why we have a problem with Russia. Im wondering if they are simply a convenient designated boogyman.  Globalism cant really be good. A one world government can not be good. And people have worked hard to build a successful country, and shouldn't have to share that success. Not to mention I have never even heard of anyone who simply jumps from skillset to skillset. Every human I have ever met generally speaking choses a career, and stays with that career their whole life. If a government isnt willing to put the welfare of their citizens ahead of the welfare of foreigners, even if those foreigners wish to be citizens, then why do we owe that government anything? It's like marriage where a husband cares about strangers just as much as he cares about his wife. How long will that marriage last?  I can also tell you this; My aunt was telling me how back int eh 80s people would swim in our local lakes. No sane human would get in them now. Our environment has become a hundred times more polluted then it was  back then. And the huge population increase has caused the destruction of some beautiful wilderness.  Now I was at the Uof Minnesota recently, I saw nothing but push for wokeness. I remember when we were all forced into a special seminar about how it's impossible to be racist to white people quite clearly. I remember a friend of mine getting ready to fire back, and I remember shaking my head, because there was no point, and he sat back down. Not one single professor at the university was even centrist. Of course it wasn't as bad as now, when jewish students cant go to class because they might be attacked.  I also remember a friend of mine was an education member. She was assigned one of the most disgusting books, which is standard reading for the major. It's ""Pedagogy of the Oppressed"" By Pauolo Fiere. So yes, our education system is entirely woke. I think everyone can admit that. That doesnt mean intellectualism is wrong. It means our current academia are small minded propagandists. I certainly have never seen any intellectual diversity in our universities. Everyone there thinks exactly alike. They are taught to assume that being liberal is just ""normal"" and that only uninformed and unsophisticated rubes believe in things like religion, patriotism, populism, and meritocracy.  And I dont think that its intellect that tuns urban areas blue. I certainly wouldnt call AOC or Crockett intellectual. They are dumb as bricks. I think it's poverty, fearmongering, and the fact that many people in urban areas are unassimilated foreigners. If these blue areas are so brilliant, explain the homelessness, crime, and poverty there?  I dont think MAGA are interested in ""burning it down"". I think they see the country and economy as already burned to a crisp( No pun about California). And they feel like they are the last chance to save it.  Trump is building up the military. strengthening our border, Lowering our inflation, lowering crime.  And seeing how 40% of the jobs created under Biden were government jobs, he is very sensibly shrinking the government. I dont think this is what Russia wants. I dont think Russia actually cares. they just want us to leave them alone, and stop meddling in their area. And I think we should. We couldnt care less about Tibet or Taiwan. We still love China.
