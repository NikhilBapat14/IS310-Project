Nothing absolutely nothing. Everything he has done has encouraged Putin to keep fighting and do more.   He has no clue how to negotiate. You don't tell somebody before they've agreed to stop that you're going to give them everything they want.   He doesn't understand also how uniquely Russians negotiate.   If you try to negotiate to end sanctions guess what now Putin considers the end of section something he already has so he wants something else in the negotiations.   You never offer anything to Russia you make them demand it and you come to the table with set the demands on both sides everything you possibly can demand. Anything you offer has already been given to them and is no longer part of the negotiation,MaineHippo83,2025-04-25T03:05:48,267

I don't expect Trump to do anything. He's done nothing to apply extra pressure on Russia. He has willingly spouted Russian propaganda and has accused Ukraine of not wanting to come to the table and that they had started the war.   So I expect nothing other than Trump to ease off of the sanctions and profit.,danvapes_,2025-04-25T03:30:25,45
Nothing. He didn‚Äôt do anything when the energy infrastructure ceasefire he negotiated was immediately broken by Russia.   He didn‚Äôt do anything after the Easter ceasefire was immediately broken (fighting never stopped on the front line).   He called the attack on a Children‚Äôs playground in Sumy a mistake.   He said this.  What evidence does anyone have that he‚Äôs going to finally pressure Russia to the table? He‚Äôs said that Russia‚Äôs concessions are not taking over all of Ukraine.   He has no interest in any kind of just peace. I have no faith in the man to not walk away and blame Ukraine for it. Putin gets a slap on the wrist comparatively.,DougosaurusRex,2025-04-25T05:24:33,13
"He won't do anything at all. Putin has him completely neutered.

Just think of the dressing down Zelensky got from Trump for not wearing a suit‚Ä¶. And now Putin has attacked Ukraine, publically embarrassing trumps attempts to end the war, and what is trumps response? ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù?

"This sub's rules require questions to be ""fair and objective,"" the problem is Trump is fucking insane and people still act like he's any other politician. Telling the frank truth about Republicans do ""sounds inflammatory"" because what they're doing *is* inflammatory, but we're supposed to fold our hands and act like it's all business as usual.

He wants to be loved so desperately. One of the main reasons he's so big on ending wars is because Obama who he hates won the Nobel Peace prize and he's obsessed with winning one himself,MaineHippo83,2025-04-25T06:52:54,41
Donald has always been a buffoon. He has been under the thumb of the Russian mob / Putin Oligarchs for decades.,SparksFly55,2025-04-25T09:15:49,8
Right. The real reason he's mad about the attacks is because it makes it harder for him to publicly attack and put the pressure on Ukraine as the problem.  What he's really saying is Putin don't you get it I'm trying to help stop while I force Ukraine to submit or walk away,MaineHippo83,2025-04-25T08:08:28,13

Potato potato. He wants people fawning over him. Whether it's real or not is irrelevant and he probably doesn't even know the difference.   He is insecure enough to desperately want and need this though,MaineHippo83,2025-04-25T08:09:42,16
