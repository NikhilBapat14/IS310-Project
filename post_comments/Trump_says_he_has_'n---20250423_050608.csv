"Dow futures are up 600 on the news, which makes no sense to me because he could fire out a tweet at any moment that he does have the right to fire Powell and it goes back down.",DavidGoetta,2025-04-23T06:00:53,14
Translation: his sycophants bought calls yesterday and need a statement to juice the market,mr_mcpoogrundle,2025-04-23T05:20:34,10
"Translation: not firing him yet, just publicly bullying him until he does what Trump wants with rates. Classic move.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-23T05:08:20,11

"Even if Trump rolls back his ideas, the damage has already been done.  Countries like Canada will never trust us again",Maleficent_Cup_7870,2025-04-23T06:05:16,2

"Like I know it doesn't stop much for this guy, but that's also a role that like, isn't Trump's to have any say in in the first place right? The Fed is mostly external to the Federal gov?",sashaminkh,2025-04-23T05:17:44,1
Trump needs to keep him around to blame him for his failed economy.,NoReserve7293,2025-04-23T05:44:50,1
"Well, he can't, so . . .",zsreport,2025-04-23T06:22:06,1
He can’t anyway.,Accurate-Bumblebee54,2025-04-23T08:06:54,1
"If he was able to illegally oust powell and get the Reserve board to vote for lower interest rates, he would just take credit for lower interest rates and all his weird cultist followers would say ""wow Trump is way cool, he turns high interest rates into low interest rates"". Now that he's learned he can't oust Powell and lower rates, all his weird followers will say ""Wow, Trump is still way cool but it's Powell's fault we have high interest rates, he's so not way cool"".   This is the game he always plays. He looks like the good guy no matter what because he makes such a fuss about everything and anyone, knowing he doesn't have the ability to do anything about anything. When he can't do something he just falls back to the people or thing he complained about because it's their fault.",ForcesBurnCrosses,2025-04-23T08:06:59,1
He opens his mouth and lies come out.,Aretirednurse,2025-04-23T08:59:50,1
He sure has been tweeting about it a lot,Cool-Presentation538,2025-04-23T09:00:43,1
"its copium and grasping at straws  everything coming out of the business world is that trump cant be this insane and the whole trade war will be gone within weeks when he either changes his mind or countries bend the knee or they can bribe him for exceptions  when they realize this is the new norm and things are not going back to what they were, then you will see total market capitulation and knock on effects that will destroy entire industries.  consumer electronics and tourism especially",Chicano_Ducky,2025-04-23T06:16:34,11
The manipulation of the market is the entire point of all the chaos. He's doing it on purpose,Angedelanuit97,2025-04-23T06:02:50,3

The stock market is not a measure of intelligence but of emotions.,[deleted],2025-04-23T09:11:52,2
"The bullying is so stupid, the Chair doesn't unilaterally set interest rates anyways.",Molson2871,2025-04-23T05:21:57,6
I still think it’s that he’s more useful as a scapegoat.   “Tariffs aren’t crashing the economy. It’s all that evil fed chairman not lowering interest rates.”,Dearic75,2025-04-23T07:35:28,2
It may be he wants to (try to) set him up for blame when the depression comes. MAGA will believe anything he says.,-Motor-,2025-04-23T09:17:23,2
"The president appoints the Fed Chair with the Senate’s advice or counsel. Trump appointed Powell in 2018, and reappointed by Biden. They usually serve 4years and get reappointed, most incoming presidents keep the same guy/gal, regardless of political affiliation. What the president is doing is contributing to uncertainty in the market and economy.",TwinsiesBlue,2025-04-23T05:27:18,5
And those that work on Wall Street that are not part of king clowns inner circle of corruption will have no one to blame but themselves when the rug is pulled out from under them.,karl_jonez,2025-04-23T06:28:56,2
" Exactly. Powell’s the fall guy if inflation bites or the market tanks, Trump’s setting the narrative early like always.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-23T08:59:57,1
