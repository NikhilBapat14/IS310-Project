It depends on the state and the locality. But recently in New York City permanent residents can vote in local elections.,[deleted],2022-10-13T07:35:20,11
The reason is that permanent residents may have loyalties and interests to foreign powers that might conflict with the interests of natives.  Whether this is a good reason is left as an exercise for the reader.,Volsunga,2022-10-13T10:17:06,7
"Well the reason NOT to allow them is very simple: voting is a privilege for citizens. If you want say in the country and how it's governed, then you should follow the process to become a citizen and then your vote will be counted. This keeps folks who might not have a full investment in society from affecting that society. Keeping voting as a privilege for citizens encourages folks to truly integrate into society fully and that's an obvious good thing.",mormagils,2022-10-13T09:06:15,2
"We are talking about local government, here.  I think fearmongering over foreign loyalties makes certain sense in elections with significant foreign policy ramifications but that really doesnâ€™t apply at the local level.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-14T06:15:47,3
"Citizenship is a malleable concept. Some countries make it almost it impossible for newcomers and their children to become citizens. Some (US) make it, in part, tied to the land their born in irrespective of their parents' heritage. Nominally, these administrative policies are manifestations of the cultural concepts of if someone ""living here"" can be counted as ""one of us"" to a sufficient degree within a political unit. I think local or municipal elections allowing Permanent Residents to vote is the same thing just for a much smaller political unit. They are saying, via laws or codes, that ""you are one of us"" despite what the larger group says. Personally, I applaud their devotion to Democracy or at least Representaticr Government. Who these municipalities want to include in their decision making is none of my business as an American citizen.  PS I recognize that my use of the word administrative is incorrect, these are not regulations, but I'm too lazy to think of a better one. I'm just trying to imply that these rules are transitory human constructs and not universal fundamental laws.",TroiCake,2022-10-13T11:13:01,3

"It can though. In the 21st century, local governments have quite a bit of international exposure. Local government policies can affect agricultural and industrial production that are exported abroad.  Something as simple as zoning policy in a city that has a hobby drone manufacturer can affect something as big as the arms assistance to Ukraine.",Volsunga,2022-10-14T06:32:24,0
"For the record, I think non citizens voting in local elections, especially in larger cities that have highly segregated neighborhoods, is a good thing. But OP wasn't asking so much about that. I'm not giving the perspective I think is right or complete, I'm just explaining why people would be opposed to non citizens voting in local elections like OP asked for.",mormagils,2022-10-13T11:42:15,2
