"> While noncitizen voting — which is, of course, illegal — has never been proven to have affected an election, there is evidence that the SAVE Act could have an impact on elections. That much is clear from Arizona, which already has a SAVE Act-like regime. Data from Arizona suggests the state’s law has made it slightly harder for people of color, a group that skews Democratic, to vote. And at least one analysis of Arizona voter data suggests that the SAVE Act could suppress voter registration among another group that tends to vote for Democrats: college students  Source: [Vox](https://www.vox.com/politics/370713/republican-government-shutdown-save-act-voter-disenfranchisement)",GuyHoldingHammer,2024-09-12T14:26:08,37
"In the past 15 years, roughly 1600 or so noncitizens have been caught attempting to register to vote. But they were all caught in the process by the already pretty good systems we have in place and could not register. So this SAVE act would put in place further 'protections' on a system where the 'illegal' voter is already lower than a rounding error.  What it is *actually* meant to do is put another road block in front of people who already have a hard time voting for myriad reasons; insufficient polling places in their districts being an old favorite, for example. Putting a fee of any kind on voting itself is illegal (poll taxes used to be used to disenfranchise the same target demographic, but are now illegal), but by creating the necessity for a government issued ID of some kind the argument against it becomes one of a similar vein as against a poll tax.  Okay, but *why*, don't you need ID to do a bunch of stuff anyway? You need an ID to buy alcohol, tobacco, a firearm, drive a car, lease an apartment (TBF, this one is an assumption, haven't leased an apartment in 15 years), surely everyone who needs one has one already, right?  Not necessarily. Especially not 18-20 somethings who live in cities, perhaps with their parents. And not many who work (while many employers require photo ID as part of their on-boarding process, exceptions are made) in those cities, either. Rural poor, particularly in the south, may not have ID either.  'Hey!', you say, 'what about government assistance, or food stamps?!?'  Well, having been a recipient of those benefits in the past I can tell you that if you have other documentation proving your residence in the state, photo ID may not be necessary at all. Particularly if you have a spouse or significant other that you live with and you're filing jointly. All of that is at the discretion, for lack of a better term, of the bureaucrat that is helping you in the process.  Most photo IDs are state issued (there are federal IDs like the passport and one or two others that SAVE would deem acceptable, but I'll get to those in a second), which requires going to the DMV. Which is open during business hours for the most part, when one of the target demographics (poor workers) is on the clock. And those are the same workers who likely have less leeway in getting time off to go spend however long it takes to get a photo ID. And for the rural demographic, they may need transportation to go to the DMV in the first place. Which is *not* a given.  Okay, well what about the internet (which AFAIK is the main way to apply for Fed ID)? Sure, you can apply online for many of these things. I've never done it, so I can't speak to how far you can actually go without setting foot in a DMV, so I'll leave it there. You can apply online. But many of the target demographic might not have a computer at home, or be online in anything approaching a consistent basis. Sure, they have access to public libraries, but the target demographic usually lives in an area underserved in that regard, too.  I have a photo ID, I have since my learners permit was issued in the stone age, but that isn't a given at all. To assume that everyone has a photo ID or can get one easily and if they can't they're lazy is, at best, classist.  This move isn't an attempt to disenfranchise a particular creed or race specifically (although statistically one or two will potentially be hit way harder than others) but an entire 'risky' section of the population; that being the working poor; who are generally not supporters of the conservative party, no matter what they call themselves at the time.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-12T19:09:19,19
">If non US citizens voting in elections is already illegal then so what? What's wrong with a redundant bill   Even if someone supports the proposed requirements in general, the idea of making such a huge requirements change weeks before the election is insane. I wouldn't be surprised if that resultant chaos would be one of the goals, since it increases the likelihood that the election winner will be determined by SCOTUS instead of the ballot box: [https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/](https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/five-things-to-know-about-the-save-act/)    > The SAVE Act requires significant changes to each step of the voter registration process: how voters register, how their identities are verified, and how list maintenance is performed on an ongoing basis. These changes would be costly and time consuming, taking months–if not years–to achieve.      Despite the administrative difficulty of implementation, the SAVE Act prioritizes expediency over precision. **The act becomes effective on the date of enactment, giving states no time to adjust processes.** It also requires that the U.S. Election Assistance Commission offer implementation guidance to states within just 10 days of enactment.       BPC recommends that policymakers avoid making major changes in an election year, given the likelihood that they result in administrative errors and create confusion for voters. Making matters worse, the SAVE Act is an unfunded mandate, with no funding offered to states to assist with implementation costs.",neuronexmachina,2024-09-12T21:40:52,10
"The problem with this bill is that it doesn't actually address any problems that truly exist, while creating additional barriers and challenges to voting. Both of these things are bad. Generally speaking, law making should solve a problem. This bill only creates a problem. Let's go into more detail.  The main thing this bill does is requires increased documentation to vote. Just to be clear--I can see why many voters think this is a good idea, but I promise you it is actually an incredibly bad idea. Our voting system works EXTREMELY well to prevent people who can't vote from voting, and the FEW slip ups that happen are easily rectified and prosecuted. The idea that there is a large amount of voter fraud is demonstrably false, and what little fraud there is actually isn't coming mostly from illegals nor would it be solved by ID.  Frankly, I don't see any need for voter ID, but if we REALLY wanted to do it, we could. The Dems are OK with an ID that is free, accessible, and has exceptions in certain situations. The problem is that whenever Reps push the ID issue, they never actually allow for all three of those situations, which means definitionally the Reps want to use the ID policy to restrict voting. This is bad.   But even if we did get a workable ID system in place, and pretending that the SAVE act does that, we still would be incredibly foolish to pass it now. Voting is only weeks away. Forcing a major change in the documentation needed to vote only WEEKS before an election is horrible idea that will end up suppressing votes. And again, if fraud is NOT an actual problem...why on earth would we do that? It's a horrible idea.",mormagils,2024-09-13T12:19:44,4
"The biggest issue that will make it harder for a US Citizen to vote is the requirement for the birth certificate and the government ID (ie driver's license) to have matching names. Imagine the millions of married women in the US who took on their husband's name. Their birth cert and their government issued ID will not match. There is no provision to add in a marriage certificate as proof of legal name change. You would need to add in a court order legally changing the name. This is not a requirement in most cases. To change your name after marriage, you simply apply for a name change with the social security office and everything follows from there. The only alternative here is to have a valid passport - something not all people have or can afford. (Oh, and the birth certificate cannot be a copy - requiring the person to pay for a new, state sealed copy of their birth certificate which takes $$ and no small amount of time.)  This would disenfranchise millions of women. There are also similar provisions for adopted citizens. A person adopted at say the age of 5 from foster care would have a birth certificate with a separate name. Now, I am not totally sure on the process of changing a name post adoption - if it is the same as marriage - but I do have friends whose children chose to change their first names post adoption and not at the time of adoption. See also any child who took on a step parent's last name without a full adoption.   All of these natural born, legally voting US Citizens will have their ability to vote completely taken away and will have to jump through potentially expensive hoops to be able to get their ability to vote back. NONE of this would have the impact on non-citizen voters - as it is already illegal for them to vote. The primary people affected by these changes would be married women and adoptees. Not to mention the added hoops if a child was adopted and naturalized from a foreign country.",OperaticPlum4452,2024-09-20T23:37:05,4
"I've seen others post this, but it was buried in their rather long posts.

" And what will the law require citizens who want to vote do? Lacking a passport or other proof of citizenship with their married names, they must produce both a birth certificate (with the seal of the state where it was issued; no copies allowed) and a current form of identification—both with the exact same name on them. That could instantly disqualify about 90 percent of all married women without passports or other proof that matches their birth certificates or proof of a legal name change.

"No, save act is not bad. If you want America better, you can continue reading. Use your own logic, don't follow news.   First of all, state is state, federal is federal. If voting for federal, federal/country is at the position to protect the process. Nowadays each state implement their own verification process, which is improper.  Second, don't be fooled that current protection is enough. If you did not catch a criminal there was no crime.  Thirdly. Federal issues don't need everyone to vote. You may not understand this right now. But let me be clear, more people voting federal stuff is not necessarily good thing, even if they are all citizens. 99% issues can be addressed in local vote. Voting a person emotionally is very dangerous. What really happens should be: if the candidate is really bad and affected your life, then more people should vote.  Americans, especially the economically poor Americans, are educated president is important for him, but actually no, he only has half power or less.   ""Voting is not controlled by federal"" will cause more conflict between states, because at federal level they have no way to fully trust each other. There is no law to guarantee the federal voting is controlled at federal level. If no law, there will be continuous argument. America is too young. If you read history, state leaders can always create conflicts, and people will be the victim.   The only concern of save act is it is so close to election.  I dont expect the audience here really understand. Most countries federal ID to vote for federal stuff. I am not citizen. I just comment as observer.

"How many of you have changed your name when you got married? I did. Now, under the new rules in the [Save Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/285/text), I would not be able to vote. Instead of a driver’s license or an updated passport, I would have to present a birth certificate –which has my maiden name. And that’s only if I can find it. Not having the updated document might mean that even if you’re a U.S. citizen, you could be blocked from registering to vote or casting your vote. And it’s intentional because those in power are afraid of our vote and want unchecked powers to ignore the will of the majority.  Roughly 70% to 80% of married women in the United States have chosen to take their spouse's last name after marriage. This means that about three out of every four married women would face this obstacle in voting. Additionally, the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality—found that about 58% of the transgender respondents have reported they legally changed their name on at least one government document.  And the Save Act reaches even further, People in marginalized communities, including people of color and low-income families, often have a harder time getting updated documents. Many have to travel a long distance, take time off of work, or pay fees to replace government documents. The foster care system is heavily affected as well. After having many caregivers, when they reach the legal age for voting, their records—like birth certificates or legal documents—are inconsistent or outdated.",Fins8,2025-02-22T13:06:51,1

"Maybe you should read through some of the comments here and then the actual act.  Save acts buggest hangup is that 10s of millions of American Women will not be able to vote as the save act requires the name on your ID to be the same as what's in your birth certificate. Many women change their last names and this act just fast tracks us back to before Women were given the right to vote.  This also affects individuals who have just changed their name fir any other reason. There's no provision in the act that gives exceptions for married women with name changes or anyone else with name changes, therefore people will have to go through a likely long, expensive, and crowded process of getting a court order for proof.   This act doesn't address any actual issues, it just makes it harder for people to vote.

">Again, US president has very little power to damage America. A lot of laws prevent him from doing so.  This is absolutely not true. All laws have loopholes. What we have learned in the Trump era is how many of the guardrails that we took for granted for decades had actually depended on the President's willingness to respect norms. When a President doesn't respect norms - or, like Trump, actively works against them, because he has Oppositional Defiance Disorder and centers his life around the insistence that he can do whatever he wants and anybody who tries to use rules, laws, norms, or institutions to stop him is nasty and evil and should be thrown in prison - there are indeed many, **many** ways he can damage the country.",Dreamweaver5823,2024-09-23T19:51:05,2

We're talking *beyond* a drivers license. It means most married women would have to carry around both her original birth certificate and marriage license to be believed as a citizen. Requiring people to carry around their *original* stamped birth certificate is idiotic. I haven't needed one in literally a decade. Mine would take basically an act of Congress to get. My SSN card and driver's license have sufficed for every interaction the past 10 years. And that combination would not be enough to vote.,WanderingLost33,2024-10-13T18:03:47,1
"You cannot vote in a federal election unless you are registered to vote in a federal election. You cannot register to vote in a federal election unless you have proof of citizenship. That should be enough. Showing ID at the polls is simply to link your pre-verified registration to the face you wear in person.   A more effective way to actually prevent illegals from voting in a federal election (which isn't happening) is to crack down on fake drivers licenses. Which is most effectively done by allowing undocumented migrants actual, valid drivers licenses so they don't seek to use their fake one, which may be eligible under the stolen identity, to vote.   Republicans who are for this proposal but against illegals having licenses are showing their colors. This is not about ensuring the vote is legitimate; this is about suppression of the vote of the poor.",WanderingLost33,2024-09-16T06:19:51,2

"As far as I can tell, that's correct. The bill states that the birth certificate must show the full name of the individual, but doesn't seem to explicitly state that it must match the current name.  However, since the whole point of the secondary proof of citizenship is to verify the primary ID (eg, state issued photo ID like a driver's license, which doesn't prove citizenship alone), if the names don't match, and there's no documentation showing proof of name change, then you simply can't verify the state issued ID.

"""potential noncitizens"" means nothing. Ohio purged many ""potentials"" as well. Their determination of ""potential noncitizens"" were ""people that didn't update their address at the BMV since the last federal election.""

She reregistered because so many people have been reminding everyone to check their registration.   Reminder: check your registration.",WanderingLost33,2024-09-16T06:22:29,3
"As someone who worked at just such a BMV, we file those applications differently. They do not get added to federal voter registration, which requires a matching SSN to even make the computer print out the form. It would take a terrorist cell level of decentralized leadership to coordinate this level of fraud across many counties.   I'm not saying it's not possible: you could, in theory, have one BMV director fraudulently attaching SSNs to fake IDs in order to register them to vote, but pushing 10,000 new IDs with new SSNs in a single county would create an automatic red alert send to DHS (and likely other departments, but DHS is who trained me in fraud and forgery). To actually change the outcome of an election, It would take thousands of spare SSNs, and thousands of illegal registrations, at minimum 150 counties in swing states, as well as individuals willing to go to federal prison installed as heads of each individual BMV, as well as likely multiple people at Homeland Security in on it on order to effectively steal an election in this way.   The reason we still have the electoral college is precisely because it prevents a stolen election. In order to steal an election, you would have to flood votes in multiple states. Coordinating this without the use of trackable technology would mean physically moving yourself without flying from state to state to verbally coordinate in person. Think about the difficulty of what that would entail. That means driving from one swing state to another, creating an independent cell in each state, with no ability to troubleshoot snags on the fly.  Edit: the most likely (successful) way for anyone to steal the election is to hack into voter registrations the morning of the election and corrupt the files of likely voters from the unsupported party. The way to mitigate this is to require hard copy back ups (as in physical, paper logs) at every polling station.   The second most likely way to steal an election is to somehow block or corrupt the transfer of data once the votes have been cast and counted. This is mitigated by actual physical recounts of the votes by hand, which was done in the 2000 election and did prove after the fact that the election was indeed ""stolen"" by George W. Bush. (Putting stolen in quotes because I do believe that was a result of technological error, not intent to steal.)  Edit 2: my point is, if there is actual concern about a stolen election, we would address these two points first before others. I don't believe that is the case, but am open to evidence otherwise.",WanderingLost33,2024-09-16T06:33:43,2
