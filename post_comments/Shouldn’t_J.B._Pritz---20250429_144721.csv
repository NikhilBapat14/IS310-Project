Absolutely not. WAY too early. Let him troll Trump week after week. There's zero benefit to announcing it so soon.,williamgman,2025-04-29T16:15:56,4
"He has no chance. The same people who sat out the last election due to Harris's centrism will sit out the next one due to the fact that Pritzker is an immoral billionaire. When Sanders' anti-oligarchy messaging is the only thing motivating democrats, it makes zero sense to nominate someone who is part of the oligarchy. Actually, nevermind. It's so incredibly dumb that democrats might actually do it. After all, they did nominate Joe ""I just want to be friends with republicans"" Biden after four years of Republican lawlessness. ",Bakedads,2025-04-29T15:22:27,3
"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker is widely regarded as being a potential future Democratic presidential candidate. He’s got credibility with the party’s more militant factions thanks to his uncompromising positions on subjects like abortion, but he’s also shown pragmatic executive competence by, for instance, restoring Illinois’ [credit rating](https://news.wttw.com/2023/11/07/illinois-gets-9th-recent-credit-upgrade-pritzker-administration-faces-scrutiny-over-covid).

He is, if not a classically charismatic figure, at least a memorable one—a large, brash, and [occasionally swagged-out](https://bsky.app/profile/andrewjoyce.bsky.social/post/3lmzm7h4ems2e) [multimillionaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family) who seems to be somewhat self-aware about looking like a character from a cartoon about “fat cats” published during the Great Depression.  He’s also *basically* running for president already.      Pritzker, of course, denies that he is planning to run, telling reporters that his only priority at the moment is supporting Democratic efforts in next year’s midterms. (It’s crucial to make sure that Democratic activists, officials, and donors in New Hampshire hear how important the 2026 midterms are, 18 months before they are scheduled to take place, from a man who lives in Illinois. “Good looks, J.B.,” they’re all saying.)For more:   Why, though, is there an *of course* in the first sentence of the previous paragraph?

Pritzker should probably talk to his doctor before he suddenly jumps into running in general. Maybe he could start by doing low impact water aerobics for President and gradually work his way up to jogging for President?,AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-04-29T15:41:40,1

"> *I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""* — Martin Luther King Jr",temporarycreature,2025-04-30T05:37:12,0
"I don't expect him to run, but to be part of the Democrat's ""team"".   While he has done a pretty good job in IL, it isn't a state the Dems need someone from to help swap people for the hometown guy, same reason I don't Gavin Newson runs.     I expect we get Mayor Pete to help tip Indiana / Michigan back blue.... which I would support, Pete is brilliant, well spoken, very deliberate with his words, and what I've seen does a better job than any Democrat in my voting lifetime at being able to reach across the aisle and make the Left's viewpoint seem reasonable while also respectfully denigrating the right's perspective.",Sidekicknicholas,2025-04-29T14:56:06,1

"Speaking as a member of the LGBT community, I truly hope that Pete doesn't get the nomination. Now is not the time to test how homophobic swing state voters are. Nor do I think he's a shoo-in in Michigan (where he's declined to run for the open Senate seat) or Indiana (where he lost a statewide treasurer's race).  Some combination of Andy Beshear and Tim Walz is what's needed here. Beshear governs a state that is a bit of a geographic oddity, with the western part being very Midwestern and industrial, and the eastern part being Appalachian (a plus if Vance is the nominee). Meaning that he has necessarily had to appeal to a lot of different types of voters with different concerns. He's campaigned around the type of voters he'll need in Michigan, but also the type he'll need in Georgia, North Carolina and Western Pennsylvania. He's young (for a politician), handsome, a family man, not shy to talk about his faith, and more progressive than you would expect from Kentucky. The only drawback is that he may be too damn nice for the moment, which is why more of an attack dog like Walz could be preferable.",Different-Gas5704,2025-04-29T15:38:26,2

I've considered more than once whether I'm being stupid not using it already. I'm alive because my grandparents left Germany while it was still possible for them to leave, and I worry a lot that I'm not following their example. But I have my whole life here and really don't want to rehome my pets and leave my home and friends, so I keep taking my chances.   So that's my fucking status quo.

He's certainly not my guy, but like you said earlier, I know my role is to vote for whatever idiot the Democratic Party puts forward because the world that I want to see can only happen through them, not because of them.
