I took a picture of the gas pump prices a few days after the election.  It's still higher today than it was then.,kornkid42,2025-04-26T02:28:57,5
"We're still around $5 a dozen where I live, Montgomery AL. Gas averages a few pennies under $3.   I bought a dozen eggs at Aldi's for .85 when Joe was in office. But everyone on the egg aisle tells me the price of eggs is so much better than when Biden was president.   It's pointless to argue with stupid, ignorant people. Especially in a state with permitless concealed carry law.",YallerDawg,2025-04-26T08:45:04,4
"False claims? Stop handling this treasonous piece of shit with kid gloves. Call him what he is. He’s a pathological liar. A godless, ignorant, convicted felon, a civilly liable rapist, a convicted tax evading fraud, a racist, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, 5-time draft dodging coward and the most heinous traitor in US history.",Paisane42,2025-04-26T11:04:17,6
