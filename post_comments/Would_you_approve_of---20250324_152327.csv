I'm a manager at a company in Washington State. We have a law guaranteeing 12 weeks for both parents here and it's funded through tax revenue. I love it. I enjoyed the benefits with my first child. I'm currently missing one of my supervisors as he is on paternity for his second child. My life is harder without him here for that long but I absolutely would not change the system to be back to what it was 5 years ago.,redditsupe,2025-03-25T18:29:56,25
"Pay it from the government budget, not the company budget. If the company is forced to pay for those leaves, they will avoid hiring anyone who they believe is at risk of getting children. Also if you pay it with government budget, the costs become more obvious compared to dumping the problem on the companies and assuming that the costs involved are not any concern of the pubic.  Also might want to limit the amount of children per person or family covered - to avoid encouraging people from just treating serial births as a paid career.",Ancquar,2025-03-25T04:58:18,39
"I think that maternity and paternity leave should by covered by the state. That way employers don't see women as financial risks. The leave amount should be the same for everyone, no matter your job so that it's fair. Jobs could offer additional as an incentive if they want. Leave amount should be enough to get by as a new parent but not exorbitant. It should be tied to inflation. ",kittenTakeover,2025-03-25T04:50:04,26

This is mostly how it's done in the developed world but there are caps on the salary so that tax payer funded leave isn't paying someone 4 million a month for this.

"Sounds like the question is asked under the context of the USA?  **My answer is, based on future productivity, a resounding and emphatic yes**.

"Philosophically I agree but economically I'm way more hesitant . One thing I seldom hear proponents of this talk about is how this would make getting a Full-Time role much more difficult because when a company does their budget for a position they factor in all that cost. Then there is the issue of societal fiscal cost. Can we afford the luxury to have this cost while also having this loss in production. With that being said, I think our maternity leave laws should be expanded to cover more workers, not just full-time, and should be longer. I don't agree with the situation you've presented.   >If she were to get pregnant again during the Parental Leave then it would end and her next Maternity Leave would begin thus repeating the cycle. There is no cooldown period or limit to how many leaves in a row.  To be blunt I'd never hire a female. Law be damn. The cost and time of the lawsuit would be worth it, assuming it ever came.

"The linked Manhattan Institute piece is designed to push back on progressive tax narratives, but its arguments hinge on sleight-of-hand. For example, it insists that Europe’s higher tax revenues don’t come from taxing the rich, but leaves out that they also don’t let the wealthiest dodge taxes at the scale we see in the U.S.  Which brings us to corporate taxes. The assumption that cutting corporate tax rates drives growth is widespread, but the evidence doesn’t really support it. A 2022 meta-analysis of 42 studies found that, once you correct for publication bias, there's no consistent relationship between corporate tax cuts and economic growth. The average effect is zero. That matters, because we’ve structured policy around the promise that lower taxes on corporations fuel broader prosperity. They don’t. [source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014292122000885)  And ironically, many of the biggest U.S. corporations don’t pay anywhere near the statutory tax rate to begin with. Through loopholes, credits, and offshore profit shifting, profitable companies often pay zero in federal income taxes. In 2020, 55 major corporations reported a combined total of $40.5 billion in pretax income but paid no federal income tax. Instead, they received $3.5 billion in tax rebates, resulting in a negative effective tax rate. [source ](https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-trump-tax-law/) So we’ve already hollowed out the base. Cutting rates just accelerates revenue loss without guaranteeing economic benefits.

">Mostly third world countries  Firstly the term ""thirld world country"" is totally outdated and was never supposed to describe the economical status of a country. Back in the cold war you were either first world (the west) second world (UDSSR+allies) or third world (the rest).  Secondly the list you link contains 22 countries. Of those countries 11 countries are in the EU which already kills your ""mostly third world countries"" claim no matter how flawed your definition of that term is. Apart from those 11 EU countries we also have New Zealand, Singapore and Israel for which the same reasoning applies.  So at least 14/22 (so close to 2/3) of the countries are pretty much on a similar level as the US when it comes to living standards / development etc. This proves that this isn't an issue that comes down to certain attributes of a country but its a political decision.  On top of that I wonder how exactly your argument works: Brazil, India, Mexico are ""less developed/rich/whatever"" than US and can still afford fully paid leave so that explains why the US cant do it? Obviously wages are lower so its cheaper to cover - but accordingly companies/the government have fewer ressources to cover such costs. In the end the effort it takes for Brazil to cover leave is equivalent to whatever effort it would take the US to cover it.  Finally you claim that its only ""smaller countries than US"". Reminder: the US is the 3rd largest country of the world. So even if every other country in the world were on this list you'd only have 2 countries on it with higher population than the US.

"You talk about wanting to give opportunities to those who don’t already have it. But then say that people who have not saved for situations have overextended themselves. That there is a conflict.   You’re treating the overextension as if it was a full choice, but there are many societal reasons beyond their control that can factor in. Grew up and live in a suburb? You need a car. Insurance is a cost + maintenance. You don’t have reliable public transpo to turn to. The places that do are often HCL cities.   Live in an area now affected by flooding and wildfires? Your home insurance has gone up astronomically, or in some cases, no longer cover you at all. Now, if there is a weather event (which is more likely with climate change) you lose everything.   Housing and rental prices have skyrocketed across the country due to over a decade of insufficient supply. It has made it ever more normal that people are spending 45%+ of their wage on housing alone. If those people making 75k+ all searched for housing where they only spend between 25-35% of their income, then they are going to be taking the housing options from people who make less.   Tack onto that a lifelong repayment period on college loans and ever increasing health insurance costs that only grow as you age and VOILA! You have the magic scenario where even people who are making 100k can find themselves stretched thin and a job loss or health concern away from losing a lot.   We have people who are delaying and even opting out of family planning entirely because they had no choice in this market BUT to overextend themselves.   When we are trying to help people “most in need” the more you means test, a greater issue occurs.   People living in poverty have it very difficult in this country and there is no denying that. Nor are they given enough support imo. However, the means testing involved in welfare actually perpetuates poverty. Let’s say someone makes 60k and has been qualifying for assistance. They receive a job offer that puts them at 70k. Despite making more, they no longer qualify for assistance they have had up until this point. Maybe they thought they’d be able to start a family with that increase, but unlike people who have been making that and more, they are behind not just on savings but playing catch up with all their other debt. So it could put them in a position where it’s better to stay at 60k so that at least they can qualify for benefits.   When you means test, you add extra hoops. While you will always need some level of beaurocracy to manage benefits, means testing adds more and also delays that make it so people don’t receive things in a timely matter that can catch them if they fall.   Plus, when you only provide to a specific group and write off others who say they are struggling—you create animosity towards that group rather than solidarity.

If all of these nations doubled their military budgets, the % of their budgets spent on military would still be far far far lower than what the US spends on military. They could definitely afford to keep their social programs, it's ridiculous you think otherwise. Not every nation needs an imperial military like the US has.",Zadow,2025-03-25T10:20:37,3
"We can go back and forth about where exactly the line is in different situations, but the fact is that at a certain income, whatever that income happens to be, it's no longer about inability to afford paternity/maternity leave. At some point it really is true people are overextending themselves and not planning if they don't feel like they can afford paternity/maternity leave. Those situations are a lower priority for me than the situations where people literally can't afford, however that's determined, to miss work for paternity/maternity leave. I think trying to pin the number down perfectly is less important than getting something passed with a plausible number that allows everyone the opportunity, assuming that they manage their money well, to take time off of work for paternity/maternity leave.",kittenTakeover,2025-03-26T12:13:48,1

"""I get that this is the messaging you want to go with, but it's contradicted by literal decades of conservative behavior. The actual behavior of conservatives is to gleefully accept handouts, but only so long as they don't go to any of those ""others"" they hate so much.""  Conservatives don't vote to remove their own handouts, and their states suck because of **their** policies, not because they get ""handouts.""",No_Passion_9819,2025-03-25T10:34:29,3
