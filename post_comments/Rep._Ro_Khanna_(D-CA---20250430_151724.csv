"We've known this for a while Ro. Won't be long before a recession or worse, a depression hits. Question is, are you going to sit on your ass and complain or are you going to fight this? Actions speak louder than words and I want to see some action out our leaders instead of whining. in 2026 we can do more but for now, even just bringing these issues to the floor and making them vote on it will show their true colors. When that happens, we can use that against them and win even bigger in 2026.",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-30T18:42:10,1
