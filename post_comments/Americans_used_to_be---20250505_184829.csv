"It's not especially surprising. The US is a much less religious society than it once was, and at the same time Israel is a much less vulnerable country. It has a much stronger economy and military than it did in the 1970s and 1980s. So for a newer generation of Americans, there's just less of a sense that Israel is ""in need of help,"" which certainly wasn't the case two or three decades ago. Increasing criticism of the country -- especially by younger Americans -- reflects the growing power imbalance between Israel and the Palestinians and surrounding Arab states. So for Israel, the criticism can be taken as unfortunate news--but it's also a product of the country's rapid development.
