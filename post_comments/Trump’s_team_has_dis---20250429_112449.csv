"Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray released a [tracker](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/100-days-trump-blocks-least-430-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american-people) that [lays out](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/new-100-days-trump-blocking-least-430-billion-dollars-funding-owed-american) $430 billion in spending that taxpayers have paid for, but for which the services have been withdrawn or frozen.  * Critical research into Alzheimer’s disease, women’s health, cancer, diabetes, and much more, throwing research already conducted into the shredder and setting back treatments and cures.  * Public safety, including COPS grants, Office of Violence Against Women grants, and programs to help victims of crime.  * Relief for states and communities responding to and recovering from natural disasters.  * Farmers and local agriculture businesses, making it more expensive for hardworking people to run their farms and cutting off research they count on.  * School lunches and food for child care institutions at the detriment of the farmers who rely on these local markets.  * Head Start. Head Start programs are already beginning to close their doors as this administration slow-walks funding, kicking kids out of their classrooms and sending parents scrambling to find new preschool options.  * Critical investments in transportation projects—for roads and bridges, airports, public transit, ports, and more—and energy projects across the country that are creating new, good jobs and lowering families’ monthly energy bills.  * Our national security and efforts to prevent and end global conflicts. Essential health services like birth control and cancer screenings for over 800,000 patients—and resources to protect people from public health threats.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-04-29T11:28:01,14

"Well folks... Anyone who's spent some time on LinkedIn has seen the ""disruption"" buzzword used ad nauseam. Every single hipster tech recruitment bro has been slinging this term around like it's cool. Well... What goes around comes around. Maybe it's time to bury that term for ever.",williamgman,2025-04-29T11:30:43,3
