"If you're Christian, this should offend you.  I'm not, so I'm just gonna laugh at how utterly ridiculous this whole thing is.  Trump as the pope?  Worst.  Choice.  Ever.",mhouse2001,2025-05-03T09:14:00,17
"The White House is employed with Trump's cultists.  Also, in the picture of Trump and his wife at the Pope's funeral, Melania looks like a ratchety mob wife.",ResidentKelpien,2025-05-03T09:17:36,11
This is just a distraction to hide all the horrible shit he's doing to the constitution and the world. Ignore it. ,throwleavemealone,2025-05-03T09:27:34,5

This is a dumb joke and he’s digging in because it upsets ‘tHe LiBs’ and distracts from the economic and constitutional damage he’s doing. Focus on that instead and don’t fall for the social media outrage mill,AndreasDasos,2025-05-03T16:08:39,1

No one expects anything different from the idiot. It's sad but very true.,Harry_Mud,2025-05-03T09:39:37,7
"Just another distraction. From what? Take your pick. Measles infections are raging, Trump just floated the idea of expelling Democrats from Congress, we're still disappearing folks without due process except now we're expanding the alleged destinations to include Rwanda, we're barreling towards a recession, the DOJ's official duties have now been expanded to go after ""anti-Christian ideology, antisemitism, and woke ideology"", and the Secretary of Commerce literally told America yesterday that the new American dream is working in a factory until you're 70 and then dying.   America is collapsing but hey, look at this silly picture lol isn't the orange guy so quirky and goofy? /s",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-05-03T13:59:24,6

"Its actually pretty funnny as someone raised Catholic - they dont really give that much of a shit about the Pope's authority or the sanctity of that position. Its all a facade. Behind closed doors they just want the popes to back up their social beliefs. As soon as a pope does something that angers them, like admit gay people are humans, they start talking about ""false popes"".     They'd probably like trump as pope.",somewherearound2023,2025-05-03T09:46:38,0
"tRump is always disrespectful. At least his wife, who is Catholic, showed respect. She had on all black, whereas rTump didn't...his blue suit was shit. Melania showed the respect the pope deserved.",Harry_Mud,2025-05-03T09:38:37,5

"Complete bullshit........ The last pope gave away all his money to help others. Can you say the same? I bet not... I'm not Catholic but I did respect what he tried to do. tRump posing as the pope is not only stupid, it insults everyone...catholic, christens, jews...all of them.

More likely ignoring it. It is the definition of blasphemy. We have a Supreme Court justice who won’t be cheering I’m sure. ,fairoaks2,2025-05-03T10:09:09,2
