But the law has to be constitutional - and that's for the courts to decide. You can't have three co-equal branches of government if one is supreme over the others.,YallerDawg,2025-05-01T18:29:46,38

Folks need to understand where we are in this timeline.  The authoritarians won.  Now they need to abuse every lever of power to eliminate the possibility that they are removed from power.  History lesson from Nazi Germany suggests we’re not far from seeing congress disbanded and the Republican Party be the only legal party; all others illegal.,JDogg126,2025-05-01T19:25:31,21
Filibuster proof? Our government is essentially Calvin and Hobbes playing heroes and villains. I use my death ray! Haha my outfit refuses your death ray with the power of magma! Oh yeah well this death ray has microbes from Pluto embedded in it so they freeze magma! Oh ho but my helmet defies causality so nothing means anything!  This is thebeasiest country to get guns in and it amazes me politicians aren't hunted en masse for this bullshit.,drdildamesh,2025-05-01T22:18:16,7
"Why would it be impossible to filibuster? Yes they have the power to vote to end a filibuster and The Republicans have the majority, but they need more than a majority.",mbstout1,2025-05-01T22:32:42,4

It should be. This is really terrible.  And we're still wondering/hoping the Supreme Court will say do. Ugly times.,Laura9624,2025-05-02T10:21:09,2
"I really wonder about that. I think they would have problems on the federal level, but one thing I recall is from a few years ago, when some Republican states proposed making the Democrats illegal because of the Civil War.",Rosebunse,2025-05-02T06:00:59,1

"> Why would it be impossible to filibuster?  Because they're trying to making it part of the reconciliation bill for the tax theft. Reconciliation bills only need a simple majority to pass in the Senate. The sticking point is anything in a reconciliation bill has to be related to spending, budgets, and other fiscal matters. The subject matter about judges doesn't appear to be meet that standard, and wouldn't pass muster with the Senate Parliamentarian:                   >**It’s unclear whether the provision complies with the Senate rules that limit what lawmakers can pass via the reconciliation process. The Judiciary Committee was voting on a package of provisions Wednesday that would be its offering for the larger House reconciliation bill. But the provision could be stripped out during its journey to the Senate or when it’s in the upper chamber**.",appmanga,2025-05-01T22:54:49,4
"At the rate Trump is going, he will just fire the parliamentarian and replace them with Rubio.  He seems to be where Trump goes for all roles he is too bored to pay attention to staffing.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-05-02T04:27:26,4
They have to get it through the Parimentarian.  Something like this is doubtful.,bjdevar25,2025-05-02T07:01:14,1
