These same small business owners voted by a large margin for Trump and these policies.,Be-skeptical,2025-04-29T09:44:46,12
">Major orders canceled. Containers of products left stranded overseas. No roadmap for what comes next.  >The Trump administration [raised tariffs on goods from China to 145% in early April](https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-china-36df035fc02b45e498cc50f213536e79). Since then, small business owners who depend on imports from China to survive have become increasingly desperate as they eye dwindling inventory and skyrocketing invoices.  >President Donald Trump [seemed to back down somewhat last week](https://apnews.com/article/tariffs-trade-taxes-trump-china-bessent-treasury-66668fa26957ece530a250fa8ea19faa) when he said he expected the tariffs to come down “substantially.” That helped set off a rally in the stock market. But for small businesses that operate on razor-thin margins, the back and forth is causing massive upheaval. Some say they could be just months from going out of business altogether.",YesterShill,2025-04-29T09:25:05,5
