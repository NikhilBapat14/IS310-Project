"[PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/amp/politics/a-timeline-of-key-events-in-the-trump-ukraine-story)  https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/oct/03/timeline-trump-impeachment-inquiry/  --July 12, 2019: White House aide Robert Blair sends an email to Michael Duffey, a Trump-appointed OMB official, indicating that ""the president is directing a hold on military support funding for Ukraine,"" according to Sandy’s testimony.  The hold affects nearly $400 million in aid, including $250 million through the Defense Department-administered Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and $141 million through the State Department's Foreign Military Financing program.   July 18, 2019: At an interagency meeting, the Office of Management and Budget announces that Trump has directed a hold on security assistance to Ukraine, according to witness testimony and the House Intelligence Committee report.   July 19, 2019: Volker texts Sondland about the upcoming Zelensky call with Trump. ""Most impt is for Zelensky to say that he will help investigation,"" Volker writes. (Volker later provides these messages to Congress.)   July 24, 2019: Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifies before Congress. The hearing marks an end to the nearly two-year investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 U.S. election, the Trump campaign’s possible collusion with Moscow and whether the president obstructed justice.   July 25, 2019: Volker texts Andriy Yermak, a top Ukrainian official and aide to Zelensky. ""Heard from White House,"" Volker writes. ""Assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / ‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.""   July 25, 2019: Sondland calls Trump and speaks to him about Ukraine ahead of his scheduled phone call with Zelensky, according to Sondland’s testimony.   July 25, 2019: Trump speaks on the phone with Zelensky. During the 30-minute call, the leaders discuss reviving a dormant Ukrainian government investigation linked to Burisma. Facing public pressure, the White House later publishes a summary of the call.   July 25, 2019: The White House Office of Management and Budget officially implements the hold on aid to Ukraine through footnotes in a series of funding documents, according to Sandy’s testimony.  A line in the first document’s footnotes say the Pentagon cannot spend the money until Aug. 5. A second line in the footnote says the ""brief pause in obligations"" will not prevent the Pentagon from disbursing the funds before they are set to expire at the end of the fiscal year. Sandy later testifies that this line was meant to get ""to the heart of that issue about ensuring that we don’t run afoul of the Impoundment Control Act,"" a Nixon-era law that limits the president’s ability  to delay congressionally appropriated funds.   July 25, 2019: The State Department sends two emails indicating that Ukrainian officials are aware that U.S. aid to Ukraine had been frozen, according to Pentagon official Laura Cooper’s testimony.   July 26, 2019: Sondland and Volker meet with Zelensky in Ukraine, per the whistleblower complaint and Zelensky’s website.   July 26, 2019: Trump and Sondland speak on the phone while Sondland is a restaurant in Ukraine, according to Sondland’s testimony and the testimony of David Holmes, an official at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine who was with Sondland and overheard the call. Trump asks if Zelensky is going to do the investigations. Sondland says yes.   July 29, 2019: Duffey tells Sandy that he will handle the funding documents controlling the aid going forward. In subsequent documents, Duffey continues to push back the aid’s scheduled release date, according to Sandy’s testimony and the House Intelligence Committee’s report.   Aug. 9, 2019: Sondland and Volker text about a statement Ukraine might be asked to put out about the investigations. Sondland says Trump ""really wants the deliverable."" Sondland and Volker ask Giuliani what the statement should say.   Aug. 10, 2019: In a text to Volker, Yermak says he would like to nail down a date for Zelensky to visit the White House before putting out a statement.   Aug. 12, 2019: An unnamed intelligence official files a whistleblower complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community, who finds the complaint credible and urgent.   Aug. 17, 2019: Sondland texts Volker, ""Do we still want Ze to give us an unequivocal draft with 2016 and Boresma?"" Volker replies that ""that’s the clear message so far.""   Aug. 20, 2019: Giuliani tells the New York Times that he met earlier in the month with Yermak and ""strongly urged"" him to ""just investigate the darn things."" Giuliani claims he was acting as a private citizen.   Aug. 28, 2019: The hold on security assistance to Ukraine is publicly reported by Politico.   Aug. 29, 2019: Yermak texts Volker with a link to the Politico story, writing, ""Need to talk with you.""   Aug. 31, 2019: Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., raises the issue of the frozen security assistance in a phone call with Trump. Johnson later told the Wall Street Journal that Trump rejected the idea that he was conditioning the aid’s release on an investigation.   Sept. 1, 2019: Vice President Mike Pence meets with Zelensky in Warsaw, Poland. Zelensky raises the fact that U.S. assistance had been frozen, according to testimony from Timothy Morrison, then the top Russia expert on the NSC. Sondland later testifies that when he raised the hold on assistance and investigations to Pence in a briefing before the meeting, Pence ""nodded, like … he heard what I said.""  Following this meeting, Sondland pulls Yermak aside and tells him that the hold would not be lifted until there was an announcement of investigations into Burisma and the 2016 election, according to testimony from several witnesses.   Sept. 1, 2019: William Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, texts with Volker and Sondland about the administration’s handling of U.S. aid to Ukraine. At one point, Taylor asks, ""Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?""  ""Call me,"" Sondland replies.--      Does that work?
