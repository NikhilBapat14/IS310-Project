"Yeah, Missouri’s foster care system has had problems for a while. It’s just sad that stuff like this keeps happening and nothing really seems to change. The way they treat teen moms is especially rough, like there’s no real support or understanding of what they actually need. Just feels like the system is set up to make things harder instead of helping.",SunKissedLadie,2025-05-05T06:58:26,28

Sorry, shouldn't have done the sex thing, now your entire rest of your life is permanently ruined. That's a reasonable concequence.",marzgamingmaster,2025-05-05T07:04:02,35
