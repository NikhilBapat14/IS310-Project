"Positive Side: Whether people liked it or not initially, I think exposure is the key. It's been normalized in the media for decades, now more than ever. We've pushed for understanding. More popular icons coming out. The very idea of traditional marriage is a declining one. The old folks that cared (or used to care) are dying out, and being replaced with younger and more socially liberal generations every year.  I mean, just look at how LGBT folks were portrayed prior to the last two decades. They fringe, sexualized, campy. To be gay was like an entire archetype. Now? You've got very nuanced portrayals of sexuality everywhere on TV.   Neutral: Maybe I'll sound a little crass, but the majority of people are... well, they don't really have concrete opinions. They'll follow whatever popular paradigm is most convenient. The same people that hated gays 10 years ago might love the gays now because it's no longer fashionable to hate gays. The same could be said of racists -- it's not fashionable to be racist. This doesn't stop people from dunking on the LGBT community in private, but I'd hardly call it hate. I'd just say that it's not really an issue that's important to most people, and so most people will go with what's convenient. At one point is convenient to be racist, homophobic, and/or sexist; now, it's a detriment. There's nothing to be gained, so people go with the politically expedient thing.  Negative Theory: My speculation is that the transgender community is taking the brunt of things on the LGBT community's behalf now. Outside of the LGBT, I think it's easy for straight folks to see the LGBT community as a monolith, but in truth it's incredibly fractious and full of internal conflict, tribalism, and whathaveyou. As you say, a decade or so ago, people were kind of divided on the gays, but then some time passed and the Transgenders took the spotlight, and now everyone that was wishy-washy on the gay community is now like ""hey, we're cool with gays, but THIS is too far!"" Stuff like this has been the way of progress for the last century -- the Overton Window gets shifted. One day we'll be saying ""okay, we've cool with transgenders, but THIS is too far!"" This is of course my personal speculation and hardly nuanced at all.",[deleted],2023-03-21T09:34:28,2
"> now around 70% of Americans support marriage equality  A terrifying radical left-wing mob has hijacked our society.  They will ruin your career, your social life, and your ability to do business if you say things like ""I think marriage should be between a man and a woman"" or ""Transgenderism is a mental illness.""  A lot of the people who say they support LGBT really don't care much one way or another and simply want to live their lives.  So they give in to the mob's demands.",white_nerdy,2023-04-03T18:38:37,0
