"Better question, Why should it? You put your money in a bank for the benefits of using a bank (electronic payments, able to draw money out of an atm anywhere you are,  not being easily robbed for your money). All of those functions require the bank to make money as well.  And in many ways, you are talking more about credit unions than bank, which have a greater responsibility to help their customers   Also, get a savings with a better interest rate. There are checking me savings accounts out there with 3% interest rates if that’s important to you",Airbornequalified,2023-03-21T13:19:35,14
"Banks do make money off fee income from customers using their services. They also use your money to loan out making higher income on interest received than paid out, called the spread. However they must keep a certain amount of money in reserve to pay out depositors should they demand their money. They must pay into the FDIC insurance fund to insure your money, its a delicate balance. In the 1980's there was a lot of deregulation of how banks could invest their money which was partially responsible 2008 financial crisis. Another law was passed 2010 to regulate banks, how they could invest and how much money they needed to keep in reserves. In 2017 Trump signed bill into law that substantially weakened the 2010 law and allowed banks to make more risky decisions on what they did with depositors money which some say was the reason SVB got into trouble.

"[Bank Loans create Deposits, banks do not need your money.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/022416/why-banks-dont-need-your-money-make-loans.asp)  Interest and Fees are the Bank's income.

"Bank profits are the difference between the interest earned on their assets (loans, investments) and what they pay on their liabilities (deposits). When the assets produce ""near zero"" interest for the banks, so do the liabilities pay to the customers. The spread seems much greater than it is because most folks only see  the 4.5% they pay on their mortgage and the 1% the get on their savings.",Olderscout77,2023-03-22T07:34:30,1
Yeah hold your money as a service to keep safe.  But legally only holding 10% of deposits is the crime.    That’s the main fear of a run in a bank.   Which your questions opens the door for the crypto conversation.   And where there is wealth accumulation there are wealth seeking crooks.  Banks crypto all a man made system that attempts to be safe. But only up to what the fdic insures.   And then think about what the value of the dollar is.  When fdic can just print dollars when insuring yours money in a bank collapse.    What the value of a dollar pegged too.  Nothing.  So the crypto argument of that man made market created by god on the 8th day. To either with banks slowly strangle your own money away over time with taxes and inflation leaving your dollar with less buying power each day. And ending with less principle than you started.     Or crypto who well gladly take all your money rapidly with a unstable market or robbed by crooks in that man made market that unregulated. But both are similar in the fact that they both have no tangible value except what money markets say it is.  Which I remember collecting comic books and the price guide to the comics was wizard. To only learn that wizard were crooks stating values of comics that were not closely accurate.  The reality was much different.,GU2CU,2023-03-22T15:08:17,1
Sounds like a solid business plan.  Start it up and undercut the banks by stealing their customers.  You make profit and the customer makes profit.  Everybody is happy...,lordshocktart,2023-03-23T13:36:47,1
"Banks have costs, those costs have to be filled.   From the rent of the building to the pay of the employees to the security systems to prevent robbery to the security systems to prevent hacking. There are a lot of costs.  Most banks will allow you to buy CDs as well, that's how you get some money back, but then you have to keep it in the bank until your CD matures.",other_view12,2023-04-04T17:13:05,1
"You make a good point, and I agree putting my money in the bank is a service, so it can make sense.  Btw: wha banks offer savings account with 3% interest never heard of such",cBEiN,2023-03-21T18:12:30,3
"Credit unions don't have ""customers""; they have ""members"".  (Similarly, they have ""share accounts"" instead of savings accounts and ""share draft accounts"" instead of checking accounts.)  Because depositing money in a credit union *is* buying part ownership in the credit union, and entitles you to vote for its directors.  Banks, OTOH, are usually owned by stockholders who may or may not have any accounts at the bank.  This can create disparate financial incentives between depositors and stockholders.",NerdyLumberjack04,2023-03-22T02:11:30,2

">	In order to lend out more, a bank must secure new deposits by attracting more customers. Without deposits, there would be no loans, or in other words, deposits create loans.  Sure seems like they need people’s money. No sure what you mean",cBEiN,2023-03-21T19:33:50,3
"For the second question, Ally Bank is offering 3.60% at the moment according to their website. Online banks often give higher rates because a) they don’t have to pay for branches or an ATM network, and b) they can’t compete on the convenience of branches or an ATM network.",cpast,2023-03-21T20:19:21,6

"They are called High-Yield Savings accounts. Mine is sitting over 4% interest. A downside of these accounts is they limit how many times you can withdraw money in a year before being charged a fee. They are not meant to be a checking account. With mine, interest is paid every month, thus making more money off interest every month. Great for savings if you are not prone to dipping into your savings all the time.  My bank is called Bread Savings and is sitting at 4.4%.",[deleted],2023-03-22T11:03:57,2
"You aren’t taking on any risk by putting your money in the bank, the bank is taking the risk of the person they loan the money to doesn’t pay back the loan   If you share the risk profile and are willing to lose money if the client doesn’t pay back the loan, then you should be entitled to the returns generated from loan interest",alphasierrraaa,2023-03-22T17:23:22,2

I don’t see your point. Are you not suggesting that banks don’t need people to deposit money into an account?,cBEiN,2023-03-21T20:13:36,1
"Not exactly, I am saying that the banks create the deposits, whether the deposit ends up on their own balance sheet or not.  >As Joseph Schumpeter once wrote, “It is much more realistic to say that the banks 'create credit,' that is, that they create deposits in their act of lending than to say that they lend the deposits that have been entrusted to them.”",skept_ical1,2023-03-21T20:18:28,3
"I appreciate the link and the comments. This is what I was saying in the OP if I’m understanding correctly. The banks create money by giving out loans, but they could not give out loans without people depositing money in the bank.  What am I missing here?
