"MAGA, buy these hats!  Spend every dollar that you can afford, and then spend more!  Donnie can’t be our president much longer if there are still hats sitting on the shelves.

">A social media account linked to Trump shared a photo Thursday of his son Eric sporting one of the new red caps, which is priced at $50.  >“Make a statement with this Made in America Trump 2028 hat,” a product description on the Trump Store website says.  >The shop is also selling T-shirts in navy and red, priced at $36, which read “Trump 2028 (Rewrite the Rules).” It comes as Trump is seeing declining popularity as he approaches 100 days of his second White House term.",fungobat,2025-04-24T19:10:16,1

"And that's the *real* takeaway here. Regardless of what happens with the orange distraction, roughly half of the voting populace of America now supports ending term limits and that should *terrify the fuck out of literally every American with a brain.*",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T19:14:34,10
Not many people are cheering this. His popularity is actually declining. It's not just pundit/pollster nonsense,Charming-Loss-4498,2025-04-24T21:22:32,2

"Trump's new red caps are currently neither manufactured nor shipped in China nor can they be sold to cover costs because of the punitive tariffs on Chinese products. Therefore, only computer-generated images.",Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-24T19:13:31,2
It just cements for me that the American people are too dumb to understand the country that they claim to love  They don't know or care what the Constitution says beyond the couple pieces they need to protect their surrogate penises  The country is already dead. We're just waiting for it to realize it.  This SCOTUS will do something that ends the Union. It might be in the next couple years.,PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-24T20:32:41,7
"Can you link that? I’m not disagreeing with you, but from what I’ve heard by a lot of people on both sides is that they actually want terms limits for every elected official? Especially SCOTUS.",Ryslan95,2025-04-24T21:16:00,1
"Is it roughly half? Like have you seen actual polling on this? The fact that it has *any* traction should scare the fuck out of people either way, I just haven’t seen any polling saying half of voters support getting rid of presidential term limits yet, and I assumed that at least a chunk of the Republican Party would still oppose it 😬  Edit: looked it up and about half the republican voter base supports a third term. So 3/4 of voters are against it. And this is Fox News saying that. So if they’re saying the base is against it, it probably is. I’m sure if they could find a poll showing more support for trump, they would have.  >Three-quarters of respondents in a Reuters/Ipsos national survey conducted April 16-21 and released on Monday said Trump should not run for a third term.  >And while the Republican president's grip over the GOP is stronger than ever, even a majority of Republicans questioned in the poll, 53%, said Trump shouldn't seek a third term.  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-third-term-trial-balloon-gets-resounding-response-new-poll  Like I said, still EXTREMELY disconcerting that a quarter of voters support it. But at least it’s not the whole Republican Party. Yet…",A1sauc3d,2025-04-24T19:17:23,1
