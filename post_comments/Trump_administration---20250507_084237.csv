"I don't agree with anything these guys are doing BUT I do think ""space pollution"" is nonsense.  Its simple. Space is so insanely big, like utterly incredibly big. If you give every satellite its own unique orbit and a 1 mile clearance of space, you still have room for like, millions of satellites. Do you know how many satellites we have right now? Its not even close to millions.  If you have a ""cascade"" of collisions that cause more and more debris to build up, that does create a whole lot of untracked orbiting dangerous material, yes. And yes, maybe it COULD create an unusable orbit, or make getting to further out areas around Earth much less safe for astronauts. However, if that is the case, then the REAL problem is a theoretical maximum amount of total mass IN SPACE, like how many satellites we put up dictates the maximum total amount of debris that could exist.  If we're going to go there and say we have to keep that debris from reaching a critical mass, where there's enough that it becomes uninhabitable and/or unsafe... how much debris is that?  Immense amounts. Like more satellites than we have by 10x, maybe 100x. If you ground up every satellite that currently exists and turn them all into 1 inch projectiles, its STILL not enough mass to be a direct threat to space operations because guess what: even if you're shotgun blasting entire orbits of the planet with millions of those little bullets traveling at deadly velocity, you *still need TRILLIONS of them more to be so dangerous you can't fly through it!*  ""There could be accidents!""  No shit. Its space. Its never been safe, and every single astronaut that has ever flown to space probably faced odds of death under 1%. (Actually I just looked this up, the fatality rate is ***4%***!)  ""But all future operations would be threatened, and every future satellite would be threatened, and a whole area of orbit could be too dangerous to even use any more even when its one of the best orbits."" You still don't understand how frigging enormous space is.  Also, here's a fun fact, the orbital area Starlink is putting their satellites is so low that without constantly being boosted those suckers would drop into the atmosphere and vanish on their own in under 10 years. Literally just do nothing with them and 10 years later they're gone. Yeah, lets hate on Starlink, lets blame them for ""polluting"" our space lanes and potentially causing a ""cascade"" of danger... that we wait 10 years and its fucking GONE. Even if they all disintegrated into tiny bullets, that bullet storm is... gone in 10 years.  *sigh* I'm so sick of people using this basically made up nonsense understanding of space as a reason to justify their political notions.  Again, I DO NOT AGREE WITH TRUMP OR MUSK. But I think ""space pollution"" is a bunch of bullshit.

">Kessler Syndrome: ais a theoretical scenario where the accumulation of space debris in Earth's orbit creates a chain reaction, leading to more and more debris through collisions, potentially rendering parts of the orbit unusable for space travel.  Correction. It does not at any point suggest the rendering of any area of space unusable for space travel.  That is your imagination running wild. If there were a magical infinite supply of new satellites to impact and destroy, the cascading effect descrbied by Kessler would continue to add more and more debris infinitely and more rapidly over time, to the point that yes indeed there WOULD BE a ""wall"" of death awaiting any space flight that would have to be flown through. But there are not magically infinite new satellites to impact to create more and more debris infinitely... so eventually the amount of satellites to impact would run out, right?  So the real question to answer that is whether or not we are anywhere near the number of satellites (or the total mass) needed to create a ""deadly"" debris cloud that makes enough of the region around Earth ""unusable for space travel"" to matter to us.  Kessler never even sought to answer that question. That has **nothing to do with the Kessler syndrome** at all.",Bluegobln,2025-05-07T18:17:51,-1

">It's called low earth orbit for a reason. Elon is not putting them at the same heights we have GPS and military satellites at.  Most GPS satellites are in MEO, and I have no idea nor am I about to try and research where military satellites are at. Do you know where all the military satellites are at? I bow to your superior knowledge if so.  Second paragraph of the article you just linked: > Strikes such as this pose no threat to the astronauts, though. The European-built Cupola windows, which afford fantastic views of Earth, are multi-layered like the rest of the station, shielding the crew from harm.  So a microscopic particle hit the window of the cupula. The most likely source of that particle is one of the hundreds of space launches that have brought crew and supplies to the ISS. Just a tiny fleck of paint or something else that broke off during their insertion into the ISS orbit, something they take great care to do for obvious reasons such as this, they don't want to create larger debris in the same orbit as the ISS.  In order to avoid such things they basically can't send anything to the same orbit as ISS. Now... IS IT POSSIBLE for a launch bringing, I don't know, supplies to the ISS to be broken apart and shotgun blast debris at the ISS and make a larger hit happen? Sure. But its not going to come from some random satellite!  >Just because the odds are low, does not mean we just stop giving 2 fucks about these highly qualified people that put themselves through rigorous training to be one of the few that leave our orbit.  Yes, we already do everything reasonably possible to mitigate as much of the danger as we can. The point is *its inherently dangerous no matter what*. People are happy to act as though we're making space 100% deadly, which isn't true, and then if forced to reconcile that its nowhere near 100%, the argument becomes ""but its still more dangerous than before which means we shouldn't do it"" - its always going to be very very dangerous, and we will still do it.  >Just because there is a 0% chance of you personally going into space, does not mean we should sit back and allow space pollution to happen until we have satellites being destroyed and Astronauts scared to fly either.  Those things will never happen. Stop making ""space pollution"" out to be super dangerous when it just isn't.  >I mean we did the same bullshit with the ocean too and now look, we have a pile of trash bigger than nations with no real solid way to solve it.  Do you understand how much more MASS is being dumped into our ocean than we are launching into space?  Here, I asked google for you.  - 2.2 billion tons of trash per year dumped into the ocean. - Between 37,000 and 10,000 metric tons per year launched into space.  So roughly ***60,000 times as much*** trash going into the ocean every year as is going into space. I divided 2.2 billion by 37,000, by the way.  Also, space is ENORMOUS. Aside from the fact that a large part of Earth is covered in ocean, its not all ocean. And yet the space around Earth IS all space, and much MUCH bigger.

">Unless one is struck in a way that increases its relative speed  So to get to a higher orbit the ""strike"" has to cause the orbit to raise, which is possible. However, the part of the orbit where it was struck is still dipping into the lower orbital area, which still hits atmosphere, which means in order for this theoretical debris to remain completely dangerous it needs to be struck TWICE (or it needs to almost immediately re-strike within a still very short window where it continues to exist).  Orbits don't just magically circularize themselves at a higher place. The acceleration you create at one point of an orbit only raises the far side of its orbit, not the near side. It doesn't magically just make the whole orbit further out.  >Also the constellations themselves are vulnerable to infalling orbital debris.  Any debris that falls that low will itself be hitting atmosphere. Lets say that in this hypothetical the debris in question *just happens to be perfectly lined up so it dips into the exact same orbit as Starlink and not directly into Earth's deeper atmosphere*. Ok, so in that scenario you still have the problem I mentioned above with orbits not automatically circularizing, but you've also added in the fact that now this debris that might be a danger is deorbiting itself in the atmosphere just like the satellites it is a danger to.  This means that there is only so long until those bits of debris are a threat no longer, because they vanish and burn up in the atmosphere. Furthermore, they are dipping into the same orbital distance of these other satellites for only a VERY short period, making them basically no danger to those satellites. On top of the incredibly small chance of them actually hitting anything, they are only there for a fraction of their orbit, like a minute out of ... anywhere from hours to days to possibly as much as *weeks* of orbiting time. So fractions of a percent of their orbital time is a dangerous time? Infinitesimally small chance of a collision.  Again, it will not circularize itself, and EVERY MOMENT that debris dips that low into the atmosphere it begins to LOWER its outermost orbit because it is slowing down every single time it goes around the world. How long to deorbit that random debris? It would vary widely based on where it comes from, but a threat and likely to cause Starlinks to have their own cascading debris event? Again, even IF it did, it will vanish as well after 5-10 years.  (Still putting a disclaimer to say that I do not agree with Trump or Musk at all, I just do not like the ""space debris"" nonsense being repeated so much, its made up.)",Bluegobln,2025-05-07T14:31:33,1

"Let me quote Kessler himself.  Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20100527195029/http://webpages.charter.net/dkessler/files/KesSym.html >However, not all who have used the phrase have referred to it in the context of **its original meaning**.  **It was never intended to mean that the cascading would occur over a period of time as short as days or months.  Nor was it a prediction that the current environment was above some critical threshold...** although the concept of a critical threshold was an important possibility that was studied in detail more than 10 years later.  The “Kessler Syndrome” was meant to describe the phenomenon that random collisions between objects large enough to catalogue **would produce a hazard to spacecraft from small debris that is greater than the natural meteoroid environment**.  In addition, because the random collision frequency is non-linear with debris accumulation rates, **the phenomenon will eventually become the most important long-term source of debris**, unless the accumulation rate of larger, non-operational objects (e.g., non-operational payloads and upper stage rocket bodies) in Earth orbit were significantly reduced.  Let me explain this so you understand clearly:  Kessler is saying that the intention was never to suggest that we were headed to or already at a critical mass to create the event, though we can simply accept this as having become true now or have passed it, and it does not change the more important point that follows.  He also then clarifies that the goal of this was to describe the phenomenon that eventually our satellites would be more significant an impact on debris than the regular debris that already flies around in space.  Understand? The Kessler syndrome describes our satellite debris being *worse than normal space debris* as a threat, not some kind of permanent or long term blockade that prevents us from operating in space. It *has never suggested that at all*.  The IMAGINATION of people is that there is just going to be enough debris in space to make it unsafe to operate or do anything at all. That HAS NEVER BEEN DESCRIBED HERE WHATSOEVER.  That would of course be true if there were infinite ""new debris"" to impact, or an unlimited number of additional satellites to collide with each new debris created. However... lets say you just wave a magic wand and turn all current satellites, ALL of them, into debris - would that be enough debris to make it unsafe to fly in space? How much debris is that, and what rate of failure would we expect from any mission flying into that amount of debris?  Lets backtrack a moment: what it does describe is simply the point at which our satellites begin destroying each other faster than regular space debris will do it for us. That absolutely does mean everything, including our satellites and astronauts, anything we do, can be impacted - but it does not suggest that it will be dangerous to the point we can't fucking do it at all.  Find me someone who's done this kind of math and exploration on JUST HOW MUCH DEBRIS is required to make it so the chance of death by space debris is greater than 1%, and I'll admit I was wrong. But I don't think you'll find anyone showing anything like that - because I'm confident the amount of debris needed is thousands of times more than we currently have in the form of functional satellites (if not hundreds of thousands of times more)!",Bluegobln,2025-05-07T17:52:26,-1
