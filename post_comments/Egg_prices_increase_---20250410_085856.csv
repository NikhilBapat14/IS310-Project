">U.S. egg prices increased again last month to reach a **new record-high of $6.23 per dozen** despite President Donald Trump’s predictions, a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.  >\*\*\*\*\*  >Egg prices hit $5.90 in February one month after setting a record at $4.95 per dozen, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But shoppers encountered prices much higher than that in some places; in California, the price per dozen topped $12 in some stores.  >Earlier in the outbreak, egg prices spiked to hit $4.82 in January 2023 before gradually falling as low as $2.04 per dozen in August 2023. Generally, prices have since increased steadily.  Ask any Idiot Trump supporter, and they'll tell you egg prices are way below where they were when Joe Biden was president.",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T09:03:02,11

"In Montgomery AL yesterday at neighborhood Cost Plus 10% grocery store I was shocked to see $8 (doz and 1/2) and $6 (doz) - and over $26 (for 5 doz). Plus 10% at register, 9% sales tax.   $5.77 at base commissary up the road for weeks.  $4.97 at ALDI yesterday.  Most remarkable thing? We haven't had egg-laying chickens slaughtered in Alabama in any number that has impacted the eggs we have on our shelves.",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T12:03:53,3
"Last month - when the pricing was highest - Congress, the media, and people all over US were clamoring for price-gouging investigation. Egg supplies had actually been increasing, most ever, and the bird flu cases were winding down, and prices from the handful of egg producer conglomerates nationwide were still high and rising!  Since then prices have been falling.",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T12:43:36,1
"Alabama has a 9% sales tax on food??  That’s just criminal.   What’s the additional 10% at the register for? A “fuck you, pay me charge?”  I don’t have words.   So sorry.",MeltheCat,2025-04-10T15:36:30,1
"City of Montgomery has 9% grocery tax, 10% on everything else. The state just dropped 1% a year ago on food, 3% still in place. Then you get local taxes added.  This outlet store posts prices on shelves for all costs, wholesale, delivery, etc. and then adds 10% at register. It's independent grocers attempt at competing with Big Box discount grocers like Walmart, keeping their costs barebones.",YallerDawg,2025-04-10T18:58:36,2
