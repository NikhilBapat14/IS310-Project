"*""All Animals are Equal""*  This was inscribed on the barn wall in Orwell's *ANIMAL FARM.* However, an addendum added later by the pigs:  ""...*but some animals are MORE EQUAL than others*.""  Bernie is the embodiment of this. He shows why socialism -- even if you add ""democratic"" in front of it -- just never really works. Some people just don't want to wait in lines or experience a real-life version of *Soylent Green*.",chrismireya,2025-05-08T10:55:53,184

All the more ironic coming from a guy who has never had a job that didn't depend on spending other people's tax money.,BrStFr,2025-05-08T13:40:00,14
He mentioned Trump doing it unsurprisingly to which the interviewer pointed out that Trump isn’t “fighting the oligarchy.”,neveroncesatisfied,2025-05-08T22:55:54,8

"I've been saying this on Reddit for a long time. This is exactly what would happen if comrade Bernie got single payer / Medicare for All passed. Everyone would be slammed with wait times, and he would use his political connections and wealth to pay for private Healthcare. The simpletons on Reddit cannot grasp this concept and think he can just use the government to force providers to give the timely and excellent quality care to the entire country.",OliverMonster1,2025-05-08T17:04:07,11

"Immediately he goes ""but, but, but, Trump!!"" trying to ask when did you see Trump using regular airlines. President trump had HIS OWN PLANE and paid out of his own pocket. Not using private jets Bernie! SNOB!!",Status_Control_9500,2025-05-08T13:25:50,13
Easy fly first or business class.  You get the short line and though still expensive alot cheaper than private jets,CFC1983,2025-05-08T10:54:37,14
"Bernie's view of socialism would be to have Southwest Airlines' type of seating (ending soon)...but with no one having an disabled, family, military, ""A,"" ""B"" or ""C"" boarding positions.   Rather, Bernie would allow everyone to go in *equally* \-- at the same time. He would campaign for the end of airplane boarding lines.   Of course, this would also create massive delays because 200 people can't *equally* squeeze through the plane's 6'6"" x 4"" door.   So, Bernie would then campaign for ""more"" and ""wider"" doors on planes. There is no end to Bernie's quest for corporate-mandated ""*equality*"" and ""*fairness*.""",chrismireya,2025-05-08T11:03:05,17

"> and he would use his political connections and wealth to pay for private Healthcare  He wouldn't even need to do that. Corrupt politicians would just direct public resources toward their friends and family.  6 month wait time for a cancer screen? Nonsense! Don't you know that's Bernie Sanders's cousin? Here, he's on the phone right now. You better listen to him or you're fired.",_Eggs_,2025-05-08T19:03:53,6

"> but with no one having an disabled, family, military, ""A,"" ""B"" or ""C"" boarding positions  The entire point of the article is that he WOULD want to assign priority status. But who decides who gets status and who doesn't? That's where communism and socialism ALWAYS fails.  Bernie's events are very important to Bernie, so Bernie gives himself priority status.  It doesn't matter what their ideology is. Biden, Trump, Sanders... all of them would pardon their family members & assign priority status to their family members. They're all corrupt. No politician is principled enough to be trusted with the power of a socialist economy. It would be a game of who is ""in"" vs. who is ""out"". That's why all of Putin's buddies are super rich - the people in charge get to decide where resources are allocated.  They don't even have to compete with the market or hide the favoritism like corrupt politicians in a capitalist economy - it's way more direct. They directly decide who the ""haves"" are and who the ""have nots"" are.",_Eggs_,2025-05-08T18:59:54,1
"The ""hey guy's; plane's here"" method of boarding is one of the fastest ways to board the plane.  Slowest is boarding groups in an orderly front to back style.  Oh hey, that's how we board planes today.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-05-08T11:44:29,0
