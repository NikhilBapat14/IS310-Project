Axios was totally complicit in propping up the Biden regime. I want these bastards called out just like the rest.,KevtheKnife,2025-04-27T07:54:27,40
NPR’s CEO is full of it.  It wasn’t a “mistake” not to cover Hunter Biden’s laptop story.  It was an intentional and calculated decision to avoid any negative stories against a democrat.

"They didn't miss the story - they deliberately covered it up. Half hearted mea culpas after the fact aren't going to restore trust, they'll just further reinforce why we hold these ""institutions"" in contempt.",WPWeasel,2025-04-27T19:16:22,1
Hypocrite. He was hired by them Jan. 2023.,Hearts-Heroes,2025-04-27T11:15:46,4
