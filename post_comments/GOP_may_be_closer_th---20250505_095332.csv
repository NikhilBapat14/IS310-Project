">But Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, said during the markup that Republicans are “trying to handcuff the agencies that work to make sure that our food and drugs are safe and our air and water are clean.”  How hot a stove does this fuckin' nation have to touch?",subUrbanMire,2025-05-05T10:50:08,20
"Republicans are trying to put in a deregulatory act in a Budget Reconciliation bill. You can’t filibuster a Budget Reconciliation bill like you can other acts. This type of bill is supposed to only be for Tax/expenditure.   Democrats tried to put an increase in the minimum wage in that Budget bill when they controlled the house/Senate but the Senate Parliamentarian told them they couldn’t.  If Republicans get their way with this, it would mark another time Democrats handcuffed themselves while Republicans set the house on fire.",Done327,2025-05-05T10:43:39,36

">If Republicans get their way with this, it would mark another time Democrats handcuffed themselves while Republicans set the house on fire.  ""They go low, we go high,"" ruined the Democrats ability to create real change and now the GOP is destroying any need to go high, since we've sunk so low.",Archer1407,2025-05-05T10:55:54,15
