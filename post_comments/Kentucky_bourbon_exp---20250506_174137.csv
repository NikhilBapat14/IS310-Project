"BC and Nunavut are new to the US Booze Ban, starting May 7th!  They were the last of the provinces and territories to officially ban US produced alcohol.              So while those two new provinces make news, it’s also time for the first quarterly reports. Most bans  started towards the end of February to mid-March, so those second earnings will be most telling. And while we tend to call it a “US Alcohol Ban,” it really is a “US *Produced* Alcohol Ban.” Provinces have been allowing US-owned brands that are “Produced in Canada.” So the ban is particularly bad for bourbon producers as it must be made in Kentucky to be called bourbon.              For clarity: There also isn’t a *law* banning US produced alcohol. The bans have been put in place by the provinces, who control the import of liquor into their provinces:         - In Alberta and BC, both control boards have suspended new imports and are warehousing *their* existing stock. Independent retailers can sell existing stock but cannot place new orders.                - Saskatchewan initially banned all US alcohol products, but has since loosened its ban to align with other provinces to allow *Canadian Produced* alcohol (which mostly affects beer).           - Ontario and Quebec sell liquor exclusively through their liquor control board stores, the LCBO and SAQ. So both Ontario and Quebec had the ability to “pull” liquor from the shelves, because they own them. Restaurants won’t be able to restock once sold out, same with the independent beer/wine retailers.           -  US produced alcohol is also banned in Yukon, Northwest Territories and the Maritimes and they appear to operate similar to Alberta and BC, where independent stores with existing stock are free to sell stock but can’t restock.          - Nunavut also just joined the ban on Tuesday!",Artistic-Law-9567,2025-05-07T11:15:07,4

And I say this as a very empathetic and caring person, I don’t feel the least bit bad about people in red states getting screwed over by the Trump administration, even the ones who didn’t vote for Trump… they still chose to live in a deep red state like Kentucky or Arkansas or any other of those shithole states that receive far more federal assistance than they contribute.   Just like all those dumbass farmers who voted for Trump and now are stuck with their crops that China or USAID won’t buy from them.
