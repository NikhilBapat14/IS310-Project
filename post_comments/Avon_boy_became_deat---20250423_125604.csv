"  > The FDA refuses to identify the source of the contaminated lettuce, leaving patients and their families searching for answers about who to hold responsible. The agency closed the investigation and did not issue a recall.  Almost beyond comprehension.",biscuitarse,2025-04-23T13:19:55,167
Look up the biggest Indiana Produce contributor to Trump and GOP superpac’s. That’ll be the responsible entity.,Oldgrazinghorse,2025-04-23T12:59:07,157
FDA doesn't know who's responsible because half the FDA has been fired  Taylor Farms romaine lettuce was responsible for the e-coli outbreak at that time.  McDonald's quarter pounders were also effected where they used that lettuce.   It was no secret at the time and the FDA is being quiet for who-knows-what-reason.,tracyinge,2025-04-23T13:24:20,59

Well the DTSA is supposed to protect your fig jam recipe. Hiding your company’s fuck up is a “greedy bastards” loophole being exploited by greedy bastards.

"Fwiw, that's because the FDA didn't have evidence of which producer the lettuce came from as all of the contaminated produce was gone when the FDA initiated their investigation.  This actually happened under the Biden administration and even they said they're not going to accuse someone unless they have proof.  That said, it will only get worse and unlikely they'll even bother with investigations now that the Trump administration is in charge.",atreeismissing,2025-04-23T20:20:26,8
"I understand it would be difficult to gain enough traction, but if Americans boycott lettuce (or the next contaminated product) until there's an answer it would put pressure on corporations to lobby for the FDA to resume its job.
