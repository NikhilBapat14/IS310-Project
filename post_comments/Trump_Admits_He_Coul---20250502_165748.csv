"US government didn't have to have an AI deepfake to trick them. just some cheap poorly photoshop, or not even that, it could have been done with a transparency and a photo copier like it was 1985   Edit 1885 - > 1985",JaVelin-X-,2025-05-02T17:06:45,92
"I think most of us were already aware of his unwillingness here to not just defy multiple court orders, but do the appropriate thing...  > President Trump... said he does have the ability to help return the wrongly deported Maryland man, but is not willing to do so because he believes he is a gang member.  > “You could get him back, there’s a phone on this desk,” said Terry Moran, an ABC News correspondent, noting a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia.  > “I could,” Mr. Trump replied.  Yea, you *could* abide by the multiple court rulings that have ordered Garcia's return, or the court orders that have determined your actions unconstitutional. You *could* listen to a majority of the American public who disagree with the way you've handled this fiasco. You *could* stop spreading lies and misinformation. You *could* stop threatening judges and overstepping your authority.   You *could* stop using inflammatory rhetoric to rationalize your administration's unlawful actions. You *could* stop throwing people into unmarked vehicles or unlawfully detaining and deporting legal residents, children and U.S. citizens. You *could* stop using non-gang affiliated tattoos and clothing as grounds for deportation.   You *could* stop stripping people of their rights while  shipping alleged ""gang members"" with no criminal records to Guantanamo bay and abroad to one of the most dangerous prisons on earth.  You *could* stop defying court orders and invoking archaic laws to pursue the deliberate mistreatment of ""undesirables."" You *could* stop unconstitutionally profiling and targeting visa holders, asylum seekers, green card carriers, foreign students, protestors, U.S. residents and migrants protected from deportation, especially those critical of your administration's policies and those who you've so presciently mischaracterized as ""criminals"" because they either fit a convenient stereotype or don't subscribe to your cult's philosophy...  You *could* and *should* do these things, but you won't because you obviously care about these people just as much as you care about the constitution and the rule of law...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-02T18:18:52,22
"Judging from the interview, Trump doesn't seem to understand the concept of Photoshop, let alone its implications.  Trump is a dim bulb who also happens to be a sort of savant when it comes to managing aspects of media presentation.  He is truly ignorant of basic concepts and appears to be incapable of learning.",I405CA,2025-05-02T17:14:46,27
"Trump doesn’t understand a lot of things.  The most important thing he doesn’t understand is that deciding who gets incarcerated is not an executive branch decision. In particular, it’s not his decision.   Courts, through due process, decide.  If we lose that we lose everything.  So this issue is non-negotiable.    Further, if he keeps pushing this it’s Congress’s sworn duty to impeach and remove him.  They all swore an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign **and domestic.**  Some leeway in the matter is appropriate, but as time marches on the evidence that Trump is an enemy of the constitution keeps building.  Soon lines are going to be drawn and it’s going to be patriots vs rebels again.    Any Democrat unable to be loudly on the patriot side soon needs to be replaced with someone wiling to fight for our nation.",guttanzer,2025-05-02T17:49:23,9
See? Trump is an outside-of-the-box thinker.   He's not bound by your silly rules about reality.      Liberals and educated people are trying to impose their own epistemological hegemony on everyone else.    I was a biomedical engineer and we used to use imaginary numbers all the time in our mathematics. Imaginary numbers are also used in quantum physics. So if you can have imaginary numbers why can't you have imaginary evidence?   Trump is way ahead of us and it's going to take us years to catch up with him.    And even more years to clean up the mess.    ,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T17:23:04,10

So if the guy himself came up to him and showed him his hands he’d probably still say his hands are photoshopped lmao,AiMwithoutBoT,2025-05-02T18:26:43,3
"I certainly ANAL, but it had seemed to me that the entire legal cover for not getting him back was the tissue-thin act in which Trump claimed that Bukele simply wouldn't return him. And pretty much the only way to prove that isn't true is for one of those two people to say otherwise. If he acknowledges that he could get him back if he wanted to, in what way is he actually complying with the court order?",guyincognito121,2025-05-02T22:36:33,3

Not only that he was trying to defend why he isn’t worthy of due process by saying he’s a bad criminal- scary stuff. Who’s next,Hair_I_Go,2025-05-02T21:42:31,1
They won't bring him back because he is already dead. There are satellite images of the compound and one area has a very large red stain on the concrete that is very large and not natural with the surrounding concrete.,zmunky,2025-05-02T23:43:49,1

I don’t even think the image was originally created with an intent to deceive in that way. They were supposed to be like labels on a diagram.,Violet-Journey,2025-05-02T18:35:21,29

"Trump insists that the clearly photoshopped ""MS13"" and the words below the images are actual tattoos. We all know the illustrated ones are real. Somebody in his admin wrote down the words/letters to suggest that is what those images stand for (which is BS anyway) and Trump believes those clearly Calibri letters and tiny words on knuckles are legit.  He is a moron. Also, whining about down votes is really lame.",RobonianBattlebot,2025-05-02T20:38:40,8
"He has knuckle tats, there’s no evidence they’re associated with a gang, and Donald still fell for his own administration’s shitty photoshop job.   So just a question for you: Why do you think Donald’s too stupid to figure it out and bring García home?",scotcetera,2025-05-03T06:52:03,2

"There is zero reason to bring him from his home in another country. He has been in front of two immigration judges. He is a human trafficking, wife beating illegal scumbag. He was picked up years ago with two high-level MS13 members in front of Home Depot. All this is highly documented. Why would we want this guy back in the US? You can watch his human smuggling traffic stop that was recorded in Tennessee.  My question to you is, why do you hate America and want people like this in the United States?",Ambitious-Piccolo843,2025-05-03T08:16:52,1
"this is my thought when the photo was tweeted- make the photoshop good enough so people are debating it, but not enough so there's plausible deniabilty regarding the intention.",fivebillionproud,2025-05-02T22:27:25,5

"Oh, I fully understand how desperate and obese Donald is to make us believe Garcia is MS-13; the bad photoshop job he’s too dumb to clock as photoshop makes that clear.
