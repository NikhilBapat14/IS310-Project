>President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration on Friday agreed to halt all efforts to freeze funds intended for a Maine child nutrition program after initially suspending those dollars due to a disagreement between the state and Trump over transgender athletes.

One for the good guys.  Unfortunately this won‚Äôt be in the right wing press so all the Magas will just remember how ‚Äútough‚Äù Donnie was on the trans issue.  We will see a lot of outcomes like this but his followers are there for the faux macho bluster and don‚Äôt bother to learn about the flaccid outcome he ‚Äúachieved‚Äù.,KakistocratForLife,2025-05-02T16:09:46,5

This doesn‚Äôt really sound like settling. It sounds like the Trump admin knew they were going to get shut down in court and just backed out all together. Settling is when you come to a compromise in the middle like a company pays you $500k to not sue them for $5m.  I hate when news articles try to be so vague on their headlines to try and make both sides take what they want from it.,AuroraFinem,2025-05-02T16:59:52,16
The Olympics has allowed transgender women to compete since 2004 and the total number of medals won by them in 20 years of the Olympics is 0.   I think the total amount that have even qualified to be at the Olympics can be counted on 1 hand out of thousands of female athletes.,Deep_Alps7150,2025-05-02T20:07:50,5
"Never forget how they bravely stopped the migrant caravan just in time for the 2018 election.  At least I assumed that's when they stopped it, because I never heard anything about it ever again afterward.",EcstaticYoghurt7467,2025-05-02T20:20:50,4

"I think its technically up to 12 now? Across every single sport even the ones that barely anyone cares about of the  past 10 or so years. Even though many have won medals, there really has been no consistent dominance from them with the many many years they have been competing in their respective sports.  It's just the conservatives who suddenly cared because their news told them to.",Chpgmr,2025-05-03T05:00:23,1
The settling part was probably Maine agreeing to a press release that referred to it as a ‚Äúsettlement‚Äù,icanplaylikethis,2025-05-02T19:13:21,8
