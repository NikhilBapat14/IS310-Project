"That’s the thing that doesn’t make sense. Disney says they’re all for supporting LGBTQ and “pride”, but then they go to open a park in a country that is VERY MUCH against all of that, but also basic women’s rights.  Even if it’s a third party running it, Disney still signed the dotted line and agreed to it.   So, Disney: which is it? What’s your actual stance here aside from using all of this as a money cow?",ITrCool,2025-05-08T08:01:21,37
"Disney won't work with Republicans but will work with middle eastern kings. If you think women's rights are better off in the middle east vs Florida, you're lying",JurassicParkFood,2025-05-08T14:57:57,11
This is how I find out Disney is making a new theme park. The UAE though? I could imagine better locations for another theme park compared to this,just_one_random_guy,2025-05-08T14:26:00,1

"But Disney allowed the licensing rights. They said yes and agreed to it, even though it means their brand would be associated with that cultural aspect over there. So again…the point still stands.",ITrCool,2025-05-08T09:48:24,4
