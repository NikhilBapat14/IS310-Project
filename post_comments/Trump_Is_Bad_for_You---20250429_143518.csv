He's going to do it but maga depends on it more than any other group in America. They wanted this just like they wanted to lose their retirements and jobs and future. Rfk is doing away with the narcan problem which is a majority Republican issue. Statistics show that basically every single maga household has one opiate addicted member. 2016 saw maga get labeled as the oxy electorate because overdose rates so closely followed Trump voter trends. This is what they want but it's so confusing. It's like they hate themselves more than they hate anyone else.  edit: https://medium.com/@kfrydl/the-oxy-electorate-3fa62765f837  https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/23/521083335/the-forces-driving-middle-aged-white-peoples-deaths-of-despair,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-29T14:39:33,9

"RFK Junior hypocritically ended the Narcan program.  Fucking suitcase face with the worms in his brain who used to bang dope decides that no one deserves a second chance.   A college buddy of mine got hooked on opioids after three surgeries to fix his knees. Narcan kept him from dying, twice. He’s clean and getting healthy because of social programs like this.  MAGA is a death cult, it’s what they want…to be put out of their misery. They hate everyone else, because they live in a pool of self loathing detritus.",industrial-complex,2025-04-29T21:19:31,2
