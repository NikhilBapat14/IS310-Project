"In high school I remember wondering how people in Iran would put up with, and some even support, the rule of the oppressive and theocratic state, I realize now that my view was so tainted with exoticism and orientalism, the reality is that the same impulses exist here in the US, the kind of people that support the GOP now are the same kind of people that would support the Ayatollah if they lived in Iran, or the Taliban, Erdogan in Turkey, etc. We are all humans, and these broken ways of thinking exist everywhere. There is no difference, Maga is the American Taliban, the only difference is that the material conditions and historical inertia here are different and enough to prevent open violence (most of the time)",bogmire,2025-04-20T14:56:02,26
