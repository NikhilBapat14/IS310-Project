"~~He was already in jail for this when Trump pardoned the rest of the insurrectionists so he did not get one.~~  This all wrong. I misread a source I guess.   https://chronicleillinois.com/state-news/trump-pardon-a-bigger-gift-for-some-illinois-residents/  >One Jan. 6 convict is now in state custody and may not receive a pardon. Shane Jason Woods, 43, of Auburn, is currently detained in the Sangamon County Jail in lieu of $2 million bond. According to court documents, the night of Nov. 8, 2022, Woods was free on his own recognizance from multiple Jan. 6 charges, including violently slamming into a police officer, and assaulting and battering a media cameraman. ",ToNoMoCo,2025-05-01T12:57:10,1

"It's Trump personal mob army. Who will harass judges or GOP members who go against his desires?  The pardon was a very calculated act you know, he made sure to have thousands of criminals ready to go after anyone who oppose him.  Why the house and senate don't oppose him? Because the Jan 6 terrorists are free and they are ready to go violent.",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-01T13:12:24,1
