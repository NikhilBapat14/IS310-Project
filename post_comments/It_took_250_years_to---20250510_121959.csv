Yeah but refugees resettled through the UNHCR quota system can come with little or no formal education at all. Some may already have been here for years and still not be able to read or write. US took 100.000 refugee resettled through the UNHCR quota system in 2024.,Unlucky-Meaning-4956,2025-05-10T16:44:17,1

"Lincoln was elected by northern liberals and progressives while southern conservatives were busy giving us the Confederacy.   The Civil War to keep slavery, the KKK and nearly 100 years of Jim Crow apartheid are all legacies of southern conservatives regardless of which party name they call themselves any given decade.   Southern conservatives don't get to pretend that they were the good guys all along simply because they started calling themselves 'Republicans' some 60 years ago.  They simply kept electing the same hateful bigots they've always elected, except now it's under their newly adopted 'Republican' name.  That's how you get the 'Party of Lincoln' waving the Confederate flag.",ShamelessLeft,2025-05-10T15:45:34,1
The Democratic party freed the slaves and voted for the Civil Rights Act. Who founded the KKK? The Republican party.  People forget that the two parties completely flipped about a century ago.,immortalfrieza2,2025-05-10T15:44:45,1

"Yeah it can. He's far more overweight and gross. But otherwise yeah. I'd sleep in Bidens bed over Trump. Bet Trump doesn't feel his stink is bad. Plus he's reported as stinky. Not Biden, but he is old.   I'll stick with Bidens bed, you can go snuggle up with Trump.",Quiet-Type-,2025-05-10T14:55:21,1

"That’s part of the problem too. Republicans have managed to convince half the country that the European countries are socialist over the past few decades, and that the Democrats want to reshape the country as such. Every piece of regulation or any new tax proposed is seen as another step toward socialism. Republican campaigns for years were won by fear mongering.  They’re still using that tactic, but they’ve put Trump at the front of the party, basically saying he’s the only person who can fix our problems. You can watch local election commercials in just about every city in this country, and every single Republican candidate will involve Trump somehow. Some will make it the entire ad. I’ve literally seen commercials that just talk about how they love and support Trump. I care about you representing me in DC, not that maniac. It’s mad.",dead_cats_everywhere,2025-05-10T16:18:08,1
"Exactly. Gerrymandering, voter suppression, and Trump has all but outright admitted he cheated to ""win"" several times over the past four months.   If we had a real tally, Trump would have lost badly.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-10T15:27:43,1
"Sure bro, sure. You ignore the fact that Trump has all but outright said he cheated and call that a massive nationwide conspiracy. Does he have to do a nationwide address saying ""I cheated!

"Essentially the parties switched when the Confederates switched parties.  It's not as if the Confederates magically became the good guys all along once they started calling themselves 'Republicans'.  They simply kept electing the same hateful bigots that they've always elected just under their newly adopted 'Republican' name.    Party names don't mean anything.  What matters is who is voting for that party as voters vote for politicians that best reflect their values.  So it doesn't matter what party name the Confederate demographics of voters call themselves, they will poison any party they join, because they will nominate and elect the same hateful bigots they've always voted for regardless of the party name.",ShamelessLeft,2025-05-10T15:54:18,1

"Legal immigrants and U.S. citizens are being deported without due process while actual illegal immigrants are being deported in numbers far less than they were under either Biden's administration and even Trump's first term. You're not getting a smaller federal workforce, you're getting a federal workforce removed for no good reason and replaced with Trump sycophants whose only qualification is ""I will suck Trump even while he beats me half to death"" and the federal regulations that are keeping you safe are being neutered and screwing you over as a result.   All while your country is having the prices of everything go up massively due to Trump's moronic tariffs and other polices while turning into a fascist regime that's going to take you and put you into concentration camps for the hell of it eventually if they aren't stopped before then.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-10T16:19:27,1
