I'd feel better if I was confident Vance wasn't going to be our next president. That neo-Nazi sympathizing Christian Nationalist would turn us into a theocratic oligarchy in a nanosecond. He must never become president. Ever.,invalidpassword,2025-05-05T01:34:31,2

"‚ÄúI‚Äôll be an eight-year president, I‚Äôll be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important,‚Äù Trump said, acknowledging the constitutional constraints preventing him from seeking a third term.

He always thought that was very important.",Worried_Substance141,2025-05-05T05:41:08,1
He will not stand for a third term if he can extend this one forever.  Either that or he has finally woken up to the fact that he has screwed the economy and faces being hauled out of the WH to be tarred and feathered.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-05T02:39:36,3

"The fact that this was even asked as if it‚Äôs a normal question one might put to a sitting president is galling.

This is not normal, but it is being normalized, just like every other terrible and illegal thing coming from this administration.

Yes.  But would that stop him from trying? Or the GOP if they control Congress from letting him? Or the Supreme Court from saying the 22nd Amendment is just as unenforceable as the 14th?,markroth69,2025-05-05T02:36:20,1

I agree it is stupid. But there are enough people who twist logic to assume that the 22nd Amendment somehow doesn't make a twice elected president ineligible to be elected vice president.   They might find that an easier sell than simply ignoring the plain text of the law.,markroth69,2025-05-05T23:20:56,0
