"**From reporter Ron Dicker:**  Rep. [Don Bacon](https://www.huffpost.com/topic/don-bacon) (R-Neb.) suggested Monday that [Pete Hegseth](https://www.huffpost.com/topic/pete-hegseth) should be fired as secretary of defense, reportedly becoming [the first GOP House member](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/21/don-bacon-pete-hegseth-signal) to advocate for his ouster.  NPR wrote Monday that the White House [was already searching for a replacement](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-presidency-latest-updates_n_68029ae0e4b01dc12d4bde68/liveblog_6807051ee4b031cc81e62c29) after it was reported that Hegseth [again shared classified information with outsiders](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html) on an imminent military attack in Yemen. The group chat, allegedly the second on Signal that breached security protocol, included Hegseth’s wife, brother and lawyer.  “If the reports are true, the secretary of defense has failed at operational security, and that is unacceptable,” Bacon [told Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/21/don-bacon-pete-hegseth-signal). “If a Democrat did this we’d be demanding a scalp. We should be Americans first when it comes to security.”  Bacon’s declaration would seem to put him at odds with President [Donald Trump](https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump), who earlier dismissed concerns and the report of Hegseth’s second Signal briefing.  Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-bacon-scalp-pete-hegseth\_n\_68074925e4b052543c13e5d2?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-bacon-scalp-pete-hegseth_n_68074925e4b052543c13e5d2?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-04-22T11:23:56,5
"I mean, look what trump instigated against Hilary Clinton on her emails. There was no top secret but she went thru so much legal investigation and personal/ethical scrutiny.
