"The short answer is that these states have a large percentage of voters voting by mail, they require signatures on the mail-in ballot envelope to match one they have on file, and [they have a process to allow voters to fix errors on their ballot envelopes](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-15-states-with-signature-cure-processes) (like missing or non-matching signatures). Signature matching by itself takes a lot of time, so it can take a while after the election. And then by law, people have several days after the election ends to fix any problems they've been contacted about.

"In Nevada, mail-in ballots may arrive up to four days after election day, as long as they are postmarked by election day.  In Arizona, mail-in ballots do need to arrive by election day. But apparently they had a particularly long ballot and it's simply taking more time to physically handle each mail-in ballot.",curien,2024-11-07T15:17:28,1
