"Passivity and practicality are not the same. The fascists will always portray the opposition as the villains. Since they own all the media, there will be no way to argue against this.   For the opposition to win, they have to convince the middle that the fascists are actually fascists. If the opposition becomes violent, they will be portrayed as terrorists and thugs. They will be portrayed as that anyway. But the middle will believe the state is the opposition is actually violent.  Look at every single successful revolution in history. There is a clear blueprint. Overthrowing a regime might be the ultimate goal, but it isn't the first step. The first step is to convince the majority of people that the regime is in the wrong while we still have power in the media. When they do engineer a reason, we want people to see that it is unjustified, and stand up against that.  To be clear, I am not suggesting complying or submitting. People need to fight hard at every step. But violence gives them the excuse to portray us negatively, and we can't afford that.",DanteandRandallFlagg,2025-05-10T09:44:04,0

So even if you believe we are not a full dictatorship yet, the foundation is there for someone else to use.  I’m really skeptical that meaningful pushback will happen that will actually discourage someone from trying this again.    On the other hand, if you’re advocating for violence, you are advocating for civil war.  A modern Civil War is not going to look like the American Civil War, it will look like Rwanda.
