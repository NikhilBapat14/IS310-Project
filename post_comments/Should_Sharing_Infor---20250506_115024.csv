Israel is destroying the USA.,pharrt,2025-05-06T11:51:59,15
"Sadly, I agree with you. From what I gather, this measure would effectively make you a snitch for Israel. You literally have to disclose any communications of anyone asking you to not to do business with Israeli companies or be fined 1 million dollars or go to jail for 20 years… why?… So Israel can maintain the freedom to go economically on the offensive after anyone who doesn’t agree with their actions.   Whether I agree or disagree with the 3rd party, I still have to snitch to the government or I’ll face punishment. That’s infringing on my rights to vote with my money and to boycott anyone whose business practices I don’t agree with.",CAFritoBandito,2025-05-06T12:03:00,6
