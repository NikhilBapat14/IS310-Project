"That's the point. In their eyes, trans women ""deserved"" to be raped en masse. Sadly, this is also policy across most of the world. The UK had a handful of incidents where a cis woman was raped by a trans woman, a statistical anomaly in the most mathematical sense, and they freaked the fuck out. But the trans women being raped by cis men hundreds, if not thousands of times, per person don't matter. This is our reality and nobody gives a shit.",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-04-25T23:29:56,34

"I say this as a queer man, we should not have to mention queer men being targeted in this to make people care. We should want to end prison rape because prison rape is a horrific injustice that is just as traumatic for straight men as it is for queer men. Not just because it affects people that your team have deemed worthy of help.  There's nothing wrong with just caring about an issue that affects men. It's not going to make your head explode.",StevesRune,2025-04-26T20:52:05,3
Trump hates gays and he wants them to get raped in prison.    Does he ever explain exactly why he does these things? I'm assuming it's to save money. Why do we desperately need to save money? $5+ trillion in tax cuts for billionaires. We must never forget that. Ever,invalidpassword,2025-04-26T05:06:43,7

Politics moves slow and this isn‚Äôt a glaring issue affecting society so you know it took a lot of work to get this program up and funded. Sickening how decades of advocacy and grassroots democracy can be undone in 100 days by a deranged lunatic. It will take policy half a century to catch back up to where we were before this administration.,Charming_Wheel_1944,2025-04-26T20:21:08,2

"V-coding can‚Äôt exist in a vacuum. It‚Äôs legalized sex slavery that corrections officers not only retain full control over the entirety of the supply chain for, but get to financially profit off of. Trans women have historically been the comfort women of the prison industrial complex, which they must endure without resistance in any way lest their sentence be extended.   It‚Äôs either be sold repeatedly as a sex slave and risk being murdered, or face indefinite solitary confinement and risk death from medical negligence and mistreatment.  Either way, nobody will ever be held accountable anyways and they know that as this has been the case no matter who has been president. This has corrections officers themselves feeling so emboldened by a historical lack of action that 3 of every 4 trans women who have been incarcerated in men‚Äôs prisons have reported being subjected to sexual violence by the corrections officers staffing the prison, so it‚Äôs not just the inmates.   Sounds like quite the attractive racket for any discerning capitalist, American, British, or otherwise.  It‚Äôs in light of this that this program was ended.   This is considered a moral win for MAGA.",Creepy_Purple2581,2025-04-26T08:29:28,6
"My sister is trans and spent 5 months in prison about a decade back. She is a brave and fierce advocate for SA victims and human rights abuses. She's been through hell and back, seen it all, and survived... But she can barely speak about her time in prison. She's absolutely terrified of experiencing incarceration again.  She is EIGHT YEARS sober, and I'm so proud of her for never giving up and starting each day with optimism and hope. She is such an inspiration to me, I can't even describe it. I'm a SA survivor multiple times over, as well, and she's helped me in my recovery in ways I can't begin to express.  If she can survive, learn, grow, and thrive, those days where I want to give up completely are becoming fewer and farther between. I'm so lucky and so blessed to have her as family.",Pan_Bookish_Ent,2025-04-26T12:41:23,7
