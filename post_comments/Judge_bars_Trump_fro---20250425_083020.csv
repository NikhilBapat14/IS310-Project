It's down right scary seeing his cult and a lot of them with a lot of followers and influence on Twitter calling for the courts and even the supreme court to be slapped down So trump can do what ever he wants ..these people are fighting for a dictatorship  not to mention he is also openly trying to take down news stations that paint him in a bad light,Lunchb0xx87,2025-04-25T08:57:00,22
Trump's angry fuming from the judicial rulings against him is causing the orange lacquer to melt from his face.,ResidentKelpien,2025-04-25T08:33:49,6
That judge better bulk up on security. He's already sending his goons after judges for disagreeing with him.,mecon320,2025-04-25T10:29:01,5
Local governance is part of American freedom. Can’t claim to love the Constitution and ignore the 10th Amendment,Silent_Riddle,2025-04-25T08:35:22,4
"Well, a LOT of these cities are funding the federal government.  Sounds like those cities have ""some cards"" if he continues to ignore judges.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-25T08:36:35,3
"Nice idea, but won't stand up in SCOTUS. Separation of powers and all of that.  The correct answer is to rule that Congress and only Congress controls funding, but the court won't do that - and Congress doesn't want the extra work.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T08:33:45,5

"So this is just a preliminary injunction. For some reason the media always refuses to cite cases so I had to dig it up: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO, et al., Plaintiffs, v. DONALD J. TRUMP, et al., Defendants  Case No. 25-cv-01350-WHO  First, the Trump arguments to deny the injuction  1. The cities don't have standing because money hasn't actually been withheld yet 2. Federal funds should not support jurisdictions that refuse to enforce federal rules   The cities argue:  1. They want the money, and having it withheld screws up their budgets 2. They don't want local illegal populations to be afraid of the police 3. They think that requiring local enforcement of federal laws is constitutional 4. Violation of the spending cause  The first Trump argument is just stupid and is nothing more than lawyers seeking to stall and obstruct. The second one can be reasonable if uniformly applied, which it isn't. For example, the US military gives a lot of weaponry to cities to ""conduct anti-drug operations"". It would be reasonable to ask for this to be returned if they refuse to actually go after drugs. If given $50,000,000 for anti-child porn programs that isn't spent on the earmarked program then asking for it back would also be reasonable.  The cities primarily argue irreparable harm, which is why they sought an immediate injunction. That isn't really a legal argument, it just means we'll be hurt bad if we don't get this.  Argument one is irrelevant. There is no constitutional guarantee that the federal government is repsonsible for local budgets. If they rely on money that isn't guaranteed then they're dumb.  Arguments 2 and 3 are irrelevant to the question of IF Trump can hold back they funds. They are solid arguments as to why they don't want to enforce the rules but doesn't really argue that he can't.  The last argument is the only real one there. However, I don't know if Congress *explicitly* said ""$50 to San Francisco, $50 to Los Angeles, $50 to Berkeley"" and so on. That would be a congressional appropriation that no president could touch. (No governor, either if they were dealing with this at the state level except in WI who has super powers beyond belief.) If the appropriations were ""$500,000,000 for distribution to cities for...."" then that leaves a lot of discretion up to the executive. I haven't dug into what the allocation bills actually say so defer to the courts to figure that out.",TheQuarantinian,2025-04-25T10:47:31,2
