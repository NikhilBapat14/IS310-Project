I’ll say one thing:  I went to visit my old frat house a few weeks ago. It was a pretty pro-Trump environment when I left school and even when I visited a few times afterwards.  But the tariffs and global economy issues have these younger guys rattled. They don’t want to graduate into a 2008 situation. I was hearing juniors in college talk about the bond market on a Friday night.,FawningDeer37,2025-04-28T23:00:50,54
"“In those 14 weeks, the president has unleashed an economic agenda so punishing that the only way to understand it in a historical context is not through a lens of policy but of plagues. If the Trump tariffs remain in place, the negative shocks could eclipse the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.”",Positive_Owl_2024,2025-04-28T23:25:12,19

Trump is an accelerationist. This is by design. Once he is done destroying the economy they will run away to Russia.,Limp-Technician-7646,2025-04-28T23:50:31,16

"China will not budge and Trump will have to drop all tariffs before it will talk. I suspect that if discussions commence it will be on the basis of China demanding a free trade agreement.  Tariffs are damaging but the loss of trust and confidence in the US is harmful in the long term.   This chaotic and dishonest government cannot be trusted and both the bond market and USD are slipping.  His bizarre tax agenda has corporate taxes being slashed and is now suggesting personal income tax cuts to help deal with the effects of his tariff driven inflation.  At the same time he claims that tariff income will replace taxation and become the 'External Revenue Service'.  Tariff income is added to the price of consumer goods and is inflationary. It is not 'external revenue' but is a de facto consumption tax.  He now proposes a cut to income taxes in order to alleviate the inflationary effects of the consumption tax he has levied on goods entering ports.  As tariffs bite and demand falls it will result in fewer ships entering port and therefore reduce any tariff income.  So, with the proposed corporate and personal income taxes in conjunction with a falling bond market and sliding USD , then where does the money come from? Someone has to pay.  How then does the US service its tens of trillions in national debt without the ability to raise revenue through bonds and taxation ?   A falling dollar exacerbates this dilemma and adds to the inflationary effects of tariffs as its spending power is diminished.  This , if allowed to continue and if fully implemented , leads to the inevitable conclusion of default and economic collapse.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-29T01:37:49,19

"See, you can say that, but I’m sure if it was you in your 20s, you would feel differently.  People didn’t have the patience for Biden’s  3 year soft landing, I doubt they’ll have the patience for some decade long shift towards God knows what. Manufacturing just isn’t happening. We’re gonna have robots in less time than it will take to build factories and those jobs are gonna be like PhD level.   At the end of the day, unless these guys have a comparably good job and finances to what they could’ve been looking at a while ago, I’m pretty sure they’ll think of it as a net loss regardless.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-29T12:02:44,1
"> Tariffs are damaging but the loss of trust and confidence in the US is harmful in the long term.  This is hard to quantify, but absolutely makes sense. Why would a country open up its own market to the USA, if the USA might suddenly elect a felonious moron who is then allowed to tear up that agreement with no notice? It creates a chilling effect, and not just on FTAs, it affects every international agreement",DaveChild,2025-04-29T02:23:05,10
