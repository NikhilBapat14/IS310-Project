"This is a very good move. I'm not normally a fan of assuming that other countries do things better, but there is a reason why these petroleum-based dyes are banned everywhere else.  Kennedy keeps reiterating that the U.S. has the world's highest chronic disease burden, and he is correct. Make America's food healthy again!",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-23T06:36:53,332

"Glen Youngkin signed a bi-partisan bill in Virginia to ban synthetic food dyes in school lunches and the state subreddit was still trashing it.   It doesn't matter that it has broad bi-partisan support, if a republican does *anything* you'll find out how contrarian the alt left can be.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-23T12:02:37,39

"I've noticed the left has been getting extra angry about RFKJr lately.  If they're angry about something then it means ***they're paying attention to something,*** and that means the thing in question has made itself important.  RFKJr has entered the exclusive club alongside Trump and Musk of people who have proven they're doing something about the old system. If there's no flak, then the plane isn't on a mission it's just sightseeing.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T10:44:05,13

"This shit is served at schools so parents have no control over what their kids receive. I begged and begged for my kid not to have access to strawberry milk and fruit loops at school. The answer is, if they eat at cafeteria then they can‚Äôt limit access. I would need a doctor‚Äôs note saying he is allergic. Never mind the fact that it took me 3 months to learn that‚Äôs what he was having at school to began with. They list the food they ‚Äúcook‚Äù on the menu but not what else is available. I only learned he had fruit loops etc because my son asked me to buy it at the grocery store and said he had them at school and they tasted so good. He stopped eating granola and oatmeal at home because he got used to eating all these super sweet junk at school.¬†  I had to go back to packing his food, thinking that will do it. No, he took his allowance to school and still bought all that junk. Finally at the end of second semester they removed the strawberry milk due to an issue with the vendor but everything else remained.¬†",Blahblahnownow,2025-04-23T09:08:46,23

"It needs to be limited in school meal programs, friend. Poor kids are most likely to partake and, not coincidentally, suffer from obesity. We're setting them up for a lifetime of health issues.

"He has said he is serious about getting it banned, but he said he's starting with asking nicely, so companies have a chance to comply before they are compelled to do so.

"> He stopped eating granola and oatmeal at home because he got used to eating all these super sweet junk at school.   I think this is the whole point of the school breakfast and lunch programs. The multinational food conglomerates are not only making a profit selling this slop to the schools; they're making customers for life.   Even by kindergarten, kids' palates are so corrupted that I bring home lots of apples every day that otherwise would have been thrown in the garbage.

"When I was in high school the meals were so bad from a taste and health standpoint it was an indictment on this country.

I was disgusted with how much sugar is in American food when I visited.  Your bread tasted sweet. It was disgusting.  I tried some of the classic American treats and all of them were awful.  Your chocolate tastes like vomit and sugar.  Your cakes tasted artificial and the icing was far too sweet.  Your cereal was pure sugar and set my teeth on edge.  Every second food option in the super market was basically a dessert with how much sugar was in them.  You guys really need to fix your food.,RossBot5000,2025-04-23T08:57:12,27
