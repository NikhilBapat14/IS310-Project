"Most of the apple juice Americans drink is imported, with a large share coming from China. Experts say families should expect to start paying higher prices for the beloved beverage.

Hopefully local orchards get a boost from this.  No one really needs the “contains 1% juice” crap from China anyway.,jmhumr,2025-05-06T08:15:41,-5
"*Water becomes expensive or unavailable due to tariffs on steel used for piping water to households*  Trump: ""Who feeds their baby water? I hear that's how they get autism, all the stuff they put in the water. You should give your kid something they like, like apple juice.""  *Mention that Trump didn't think people shouldn't feed babies apple juice and suggesting people feed their kid water instead*  Trump: ""When did I say that? That doesn't sound like something I'd say. Fake news.""  *Show the clip where Trump says feed your kid water and not apple juice*  Trump: ""You're not being very nice. Can't you be nice to me? This interview is over."" *stands up, storms across the room, accidentally walks into a closet*",reckless_commenter,2025-05-06T09:33:04,7

"A good number of domestic orchards have, over the years, been ripped up in favor of more profitable crops (like wine grapes). If local juice production is going to be built up again, it will take years to rebuild that lost capacity, nevermind expand it.",Hrmbee,2025-05-06T08:38:40,9
