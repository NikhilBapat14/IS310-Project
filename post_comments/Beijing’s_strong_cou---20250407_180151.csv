I think congress is going to have to step up and do something. I understand they are cowards and nobody wants to tell the mad king no. But he’s leading us off the edge. He says there will be no inflation while threatening a 100 percent tariff against China. That would literally double the price of the things we buy. It’s not like factories are popping up overnight to make the things we need.   Trump is too stubborn to back down and say he screwed up because he is an idiot who doesn’t know what he’s doing. It’s going to be up to congress to save us from his hubris. Hopefully they can figure out a plan before he does much more damage. God help us. ,Culturedwarrior24,2025-04-07T18:35:32,1
