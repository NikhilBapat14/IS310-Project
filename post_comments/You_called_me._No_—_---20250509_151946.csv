I'm gonna take wild guess here and say that the guy convicted of felony fraud and already caught in more than fifty thousand documented lies is the liar in this scenario...,Beantown-Jack,2025-05-09T15:25:35,28

"It’s all pointless anyway, the tariffs are going to be blocked by a court, probably next week after the hearing on Tuesday. Trump was just pushing for the meeting this weekend to try to get a concession from China before the court case, so he could show something for it. I have no doubt Trump asked for it for this reason. China has absolutely no reason to make any concessions considering this is likely to just disappear entirely when it’s ruled that he can’t actually do this unilaterally",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-09T15:25:54,8

I'm gonna take a wild guess & say the guy who lies more than he breathes is probably the 1 not being truthful... ,StrangerFew2424,2025-05-09T16:08:28,5
If you take Trump at face value he said that instituting tariffs was to get countries to talk. If that was the case then instituting tariffs was admitting that the US wanted talks.,CockBrother,2025-05-09T15:29:18,2
