"So this happened back in March. Yesterday the Senate passed Rand Paul's bill to block Trump's tariffs on Canada. It's obviously going to die in the House. But *how* it will die is some master-level f**kery the GOP pulled that shields them from ever needing to grow a spine.   It's pretty convoluted, but basically the GOP turned the definition of one day into one year so they won't have to vote on (or against) Trump's tariffs. So they they don't look like they're going against Trump or that they're endorsing his tariffs. They have the power to stop this. They not only won't, they did it in the most cowardly way possible.  >""Each day for the remainder of the first session of the 119th Congress shall not constitute a calendar day for purposes of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act with respect to a joint resolution terminating a national emergency declared by the President on February 1, 2025,"" is how the relevant portion of the rules package spells things out.  >Yes, bizarrely, Congress can declare a day to not be a day because Congress can make whatever rules it wants to govern its own proceedings.",undercurrents,2025-04-04T10:56:04,16
These are the “fiscal hawks” that want to bring down our national debt,Economy_Swim_8585,2025-04-04T11:18:38,11
"Yes, this happened.   But what else happened over the last day or two is the increasing number of Congressional Republicans coming out against the tariffs. If history is destined to repeat itself, these tariffs are essentially going to spell the end of Republican control at the Federal level for quite some time.    Anyways.  Trump already said he won't sign shit if it makes it his office.",crucial_geek,2025-04-04T13:11:37,5
History has a way of repeating itself but not necessarily in the best way. I wouldn't be surprised if this hardly damages the Republican control.,SixOneNiner2113,2025-04-04T15:52:28,1
