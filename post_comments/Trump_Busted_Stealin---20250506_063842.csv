"From the article, “Trump, a one-time reality TV star, admitted in 2018 that he pardoned conservative author Dinesh D’Souza, jailed over an illegal campaign contribution, after seeing him on television. “I don‘t know him, I never met him. I called him last night, first time I’ve ever spoken to him. I said I’m pardoning you. Nobody asked me to do it,” he said at the time.” Also, “In 2016, Trump even admitted that he looked for military advice on cable channels. ""Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great-you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows, and you have the generals,"" he told Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd.”",cupcakes_and_whiskey,2025-05-06T21:37:11,2

"Ahhh…see you got your little pee pee all bent out of shape because someone said something about your king  that hurt your feelings. Let us just stick to pure facts.  What’s asinine about your “Like Biden” quote is, Joe Biden does not have a history of Alzheimer’s in his family. Donald Trump’s family dies have a history of Alzheimer’s-and if you were able to read-you would know that the disease can be hereditary. Fred Trump, Donny’s daddy died from complications of Alzheimers (pneumonia) to be precise. Now it is well documented that Fred stared showing major cognitive decline at a later age even though he was diagnosed at 84.  Donny, before he became the orange lunatic we see before us, discussed his father’s decline and how it terrifies him to think he could go down that path. The slurring of the words, the poor balance, memory issues that have him discussing events of the past as if they were the present (his confusion with the Harlem Riots of 1964 to his war with Harvard) and his inconvenience follow the same things that he watched his father go through 25 years ago. In fact, they are exactly the same as Fred Trump had when he went into rapid decline. So to say Donald Trump is suffering from Alzheimers comes from a place of knowledge. Whereas, Joe Biden, who is in cognitive decline, does not have a family history of Alzheimers. Not all cognitive decline is Alzhimer’s. But all Alzheimers diagnoses come with cognitive decline.  So when you say “Like Biden”, it means you are one of the many uneducated and borderline illiterate Trump cult members that will be SHOCKED when he dies of a heart attack, stroke or even, just like his daddy pneumonia.
