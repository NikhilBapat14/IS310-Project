"So it's not a politics thing, its actually a stagecraft thing honed from decades of data from the television and film industry.   Here's just one of the studies that highlights this phenomenon.   https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228448619_Which_Way_Did_He_Go_Directionality_of_Film_Character_and_Camera_Movement_and_Subsequent_Spectator_Interpretation  The TLDR of it is:   How we visually analyze something is strongly tied to our cultural environment. For Americans, thats largely influenced by how we teach our children to read: from left to right.   When watching content on a visual medium like television, moving from left to right on the screen feels natural to us, and more commonly elicits a ""positive"" reception of the content.   Moving from right to left however, feels unnatural and subconsciously our brain interprets it as ""negative"" reception of the content.   Politicians want to be on the right hand of the screen because it takes advantage of this little tidbit of stagecraft knowledge.   How much effect that marginal interpretation of our subconscious actually plays in our decision making is probably negligible when it comes to politics.   But any campaign manager worth their salt will take any chance, marginal or not, to benefit their candidate in whatever way they can.",Jak03e,2024-09-05T12:18:52,57
"I don’t think it matters much at all.    If my coffee deprived brain is accurately interpreting stage placement though this does mean Trump will have more opportunity to show off the ear that got shot when he turns to face Harris when she speaks.    Even though it should be fully healed by then I imagine we’ll see him posture in ways intended to draw attention to it.   Hell, it wouldn’t be out of character for him to completely ham it up and wear an actual bandage again.",Mrgoodtrips64,2024-09-05T12:13:58,4
"There's this one episode of Madam Secretary where China and Japan almost go to war, and part of the disagreement was which representative gets to extend his hand and ""show dominance and leadership"" and which is on the receiving end of that handshake.   I imagine that part was based on real-life human behavior in politics. Everyone is so hyper focused on optics that they forget half of the time it's inconsequential.",traplords8n,2024-09-05T12:21:36,5
"Think about how our eye naturally gravitates when it follows things. It goes from left to right. You might say “oh that doesn’t matter to me,” but that’s the point. It’s subconscious. It’s so subtle you don’t even recognize it, and think it doesn’t matter.   We even associate the right side with correctness: anything left is “evil” (e.g., “sinister”), anything right is good.  It’s subconscious marketing. If it wasn’t true, then campaigns wouldn’t be fighting so hard over it",cracksilog,2024-09-05T19:48:37,4

"I mean, lots of evidence shows debates don't really matter, so which side of the screen you're on definitely doesn't matter. It's just a way make sure the candidates have as few excuses about the structure as possible. Nothing to really put too much thought into.",mormagils,2024-09-05T11:39:08,-1

Isn’t it wild that we allow this kind of intentional manipulation to continue to go on in our elections? Why do we praise candidates for being the best manipulator?,yesterdaysnoodles,2024-09-14T15:26:24,2
"Sometimes it IS in the candidate's mind. Aside from considering the more obvious habits people use to consume visual content, it often comes down to which direction a candidate thinks captures their best side or which side looks more natural or feels more comfortable.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T17:31:28,2

"To add a bit more, didn't investigators believe at first that the teleprompter ""shrapnel"" hit that ear? A day or so later, when it was still the talk of every newscast, I heard that being said and pictures of the teleprompter with a corner missing. Then the talk turned to the huge bandage, and I never heard the decision on the teleprompter.   Also, there were witnesses in the crowd interviewed on TV that were all saying the shots came from their right. That would be his left. How did a shot (or shrapnel) come from his left and hit his right ear? Did it go in one ear, out the other or what?",Better-Mushroom3336,2024-10-05T05:54:38,1
"We allow it because there are millions of us who think this “doesn’t matter.” Take a look at *just this thread* of responses for example. There are dozens of comments that say “oh I don’t really care if the person is standing left or right.” But it absolutely does matter. Studies show this. For example we associate ambidextrousness with being really talented right? Like a switch hitter in baseball? What does ambidextrous mean? It literally means “two right (hands)”. Dexter means right in Latin.   Why do companies bother running commercials or naming sports arenas and stadiums after themselves or plaster their logo on sports uniforms? Because it works.   We’re all stupider than we think we are. If there were more people who would just admit that subliminal and manipulative tactics worked on them instead of claiming it doesn’t work, then we would have less “manipulation” in the system",cracksilog,2024-09-14T15:45:59,1

"There's almost no evidence that debates have a material impact on voter behavior. Yes, Biden dropped out after the debate, but Biden's allies were saying all along that once the news cycle turned, the Biden's fortunes would improve substantially just because Trump was awful and the underlying fundamentals of the political situation favored the Dems. So far, Harris seems to be making that come true. There's a real chance the debate had very little to do with any actual voter behavior this year, just like it always doesn't.",mormagils,2024-09-05T12:32:52,-1
"I totally agree with you. I’m just always disappointed by the psychological manipulation and underhanded tactics that each candidate uses to “win”.   People think it doesn’t work, as you say, they believe they’re immune to it.  Much of the way Harris speaks uses framing a lawyer would use in a court case.  Which is a psychological tactic also used to frame guilty people as innocent.  Yet, democrats pretend they are more progressive and thus more moral. When the reality is they are much more cunning.  Republicans will stab you in your front but democrats will stab you in the back.  I’m just fed up with this two party system everyone else seems so attached to. I cannot figure out why we haven’t revolted or evolved when we all know both sides are bought by lobbyists. There is no morality left. It’s all just financial agenda, propaganda, manipulation, etc.  but we pretend the people have a say.",yesterdaysnoodles,2024-09-14T16:01:52,1
"The smart candidate should be. I know what you’re implying, but it’s literally idiotic to not utilize every single capability to present yourself in the best light to your voters.  Harris isn’t stupid enough to ignore the details.",LitesoBrite,2024-09-05T18:19:25,3
Yep--all the more reason they're inclined to flip a coin. You-know-who would be clamoring for the side that best hides his bald spot. He seems to prefer his right side.,NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T18:01:51,2
"You’re saying that had Biden not dropped out, he’d now be doing as well as Harris is doing? No freaking way",cracksmack85,2024-09-05T13:04:48,5
">There's almost no evidence that debates have a material impact on voter behavior.   That's a different, more specific claim than ""debates don't matter."" I don't necessarily disagree with it, although again, I believe this one might be different since the Harris campaign will be the shortest in modern political history, so there's a higher chance that exposure to her could have a bigger impact on voters than in an average election year.",Knife_Operator,2024-09-05T12:37:13,2
"Agreed. The debates haven't usually been a deciding factor in elections.  But, I would suggest that in THIS election, the debate(s) may play an outsized role, given how short the window of time is that Harris has to let late-comers become more familiar with her. So, it's less about it being a debate and more about the exposure Harris will get this close to Election Day.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T17:37:01,1
"What I'm saying is that all of the bump we've seen from Harris is unlikely just about her. Right before the debate, remember, Harris' numbers were worse than Biden's. She fared worse in head or head polls, had lower favorablility, and was widely regarded as a political failure that underperformed as president. If the narrative can magically change for her, it could change for him too.",mormagils,2024-09-05T13:26:27,1
"So again, sometimes it can be hard to accept when we're in the middle of it, but there is NO evidence that debates affect voter decisions. None. The Biden folks who didn't want him to drop out, who most folks would agree were clearly wrong, pretty much predicted the race will be exactly as it is now if we just stopped talking all day every day about how old Biden is. There is absolutely no way to prove that anything that happened after the debate has any causal link with the debate. None. And again, pretty much all the evidence we DO have suggests that debates do nothing more than create a short term move in the polls that fades as soon as the next thing happens.",mormagils,2024-09-05T12:41:21,1
"I mean, maybe. Literally every election has some reason a debate might actually matter this time. We've yet to see when that came true. It's possible it will this time. But I prefer to go on what we have observed to be true, when possible.",mormagils,2024-09-06T17:10:15,1
"Anything could happen at this point. Even the polls aren't predictive. Timing, candidate behavior, the news and who is polled makes things highly variable. We can't conclude anything about what opinions of Harris were mean for her chances now. As a lifelong Independent, I have to say I've watched what's been happening in both parties.  But, I don't recall any surveys saying that Harris was widely perceived as a political failure unless it was a poll among right-leaning voters or conducted by right-leaning pollsters.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T17:47:03,1
I'm aware of all of that. You haven't responded to anything I actually said and are just talking past me.,Knife_Operator,2024-09-05T13:37:55,2
It may not significantly affect who a given voter will vote for - but it will certainly affect what voters are talking about for the near future.,myrichiehaynes,2024-09-05T19:08:10,1
"Me too. I also usually subscribe to the ""what's past is prologue"" philosophy but I always have an eye open for critical differences between circumstances and how much they might matter.   With such a shortened campaign cycle for Harris-Walz and the outsized role ""undecided"" voters will play in THIS election, I believe every time Harris and Waltz step up to the plate in front of a large audience, it has the potential to carry disproportionate weight, if they use the opportunity effectively.  Whether it's a debate or something else that gets a lot of coverage, if it gives undecided voters the feeling or the information they need to make a decision, it matters. With so little time remaining to elevate her profile as a presidential candidate, every appearance matters and it matters more for her than for Trump.   It cuts both ways though. Either candidate can hit a home run or flub their opportunity to create a good impression for the broadest number of people. Since we don't have a crystal ball here, we can only wait to see how they perform and how they will be viewed.   Either way, it matters more for Harris than for Trump since he's a known quantity and has been campaigning since the Biden days. Only time will tell.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-07T19:11:03,1

"Oh sure, the debates have a very meaningful effect on short term narrative. No doubt about that.",mormagils,2024-09-06T17:11:25,1
"I don't know I agree with a number of your assumptions here. Maybe undecided voters will play an outsized role, maybe not. I don't think Trump is more of a known quantity neciessarily--there's been a number of things recently that have changed his game, from the felony conviction to the recent Russia stuff to Project 2025. We will see.",mormagils,2024-09-07T20:24:59,1
"You're using data from past election cycles to support your point that debates in the future will have no effect, while ignoring the fact that there are unprecedented circumstances in this election cycle that *could* cause the debate to have more of an impact on voter behavior than normal. This isn't a normal election or debate.",Knife_Operator,2024-09-05T13:41:00,1
"Well every election seems unprecedented and unique while it's in progress. People said literally this exact thing about the debates in 2020, 2016, 2008, and more. My point is that so far without fail all those ""unprecedented circumstances that could possibly matter"" ended up actually not mattering at all.  Your argument is essentially that the future is unknowable so let's assume it's different in the way I hope. That's just not a good point to make.",mormagils,2024-09-05T13:44:43,1
"At what point have I expressed any desire for the debate outcome to go one way or another? I don't think I could have used *more* cautious language.  Biden dropping out and Harris having an extremely short campaign is completely unprecedented in the modern era. This combination of factors leads to a) fewer voters having an understanding or impression of Harris's demeanor and platform than in a normal election cycle and b) significantly more interest in the upcoming debate than in a normal election cycle, both because of the interest in seeing Harris's first major interaction with Trump as well as the increased hype resulting from the previous debate and Biden dropping out.  All of this is to support my point that this debate *could* have some effect on voter behavior. I didn't say it *will*, and I didn't say the impact would be significant.  *Your* argument is ""previous debates had no effect, so no future debate will ever have any effect,"" which is just as useful as your characterization of my point.",Knife_Operator,2024-09-05T13:52:45,1
"Right, but what I'm saying is that every single campaign has things about it that are unprecedented and MIGHT mean the previously understood stuff is incorrect...but 9 times out of 10 what actually happens is that new unique thing doesn't change anything.   You're of course right that this debate COULD be the one in history that actually impacts voting behavior. We could probably say that about literally every debate that's yet to happen, though. And the last debate that arguably had the greatest actual impact on anything...may not have actually had much of an impact on anything.   And yes, ""all evidence shows that previous debates didn't mean anything and therefore there is no reason to expect this debate will mean anything either"" is actually how good arguments work. That's what using evidence and proven information looks like. Saying ""things could be different this time tho"" is the exact opposite of that.",mormagils,2024-09-05T14:24:04,0
"It's impossible to know BUT, the debate may be more consequential for her than for past candidates. As a late entrant, with such a short window of time, every campaign event may take on greater importance to Harris's outcome--especially if it's widely viewed and particularly for the late deciders.  Edit: shortened for simplicity.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-09-05T17:57:47,2
