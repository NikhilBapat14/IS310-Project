Mr. Rogers left a message through the ages to MAGA and to us all.

Anger is easy. It's simple. It's a knee jerk response.   Empathy requires you to reflect. It's a sign of critical thinking.,FrederickClover,2025-05-05T23:13:29,10

"“Well, nobody showed me any empathy- that new word that’s become very big lately.  No empathy for me.  I was ruthlessly and mercilessly attacked.  I’m lucky I have any money left, quite honestly!!”",PsykickPriest,2025-05-06T00:42:09,3
"The first thing I think of when I see something this heartless is the Grinch stealing Christmas. And then I remember the Whos of Whoville who made sure Christmas came anyway, because it was love, not things, that mattered. Trump can't take empathy away. He can defund PBS, he can rant about it, he might even make caring illegal. But for empathetic people, love is still here. Take that, Trump, ya stupid f*ckstick.",Trick-Sound-4461,2025-05-06T06:25:00,3

"Far too many people in my hometown think being an asshole/bitch is endearing and something to be proud of. Then there are the ones who actually find it to be an attractive trait in their mate.

That is not their fault. Their policy makes it so the big movers don't want to be interviewed there since they can't ban subjects. They basically get stone walled for having ethics.,NecroticToaster,2025-05-06T07:12:12,3

"And it’s not an accident. The various groups who want to sabotage governance in the United States (Confederates, Russians etc.) did their market research and realized that white males who feel marginalized respond extremely well to power fantasies. They think being empathetic to people “lesser” than them makes them less powerful. The concept of mercy, or “speak softly but carry a big stick” is dead, and now the average Republican male thinks they’re a bloodthirsty seal team 6 operator.",P1xelHunter78,2025-05-05T19:47:37,28

"We can absolutely agree to disagree, in that regard.   I think that you can order people to do things that go against one's empathetic nature. But I mean, I watched Schindler's List and Paradise Now - people made movies about times (some ongoing) where empathy was driven out, but the existence of these movies show that empathy is not gone.  That said, it's ok if you don't agree with me about empathy's enduring presence :)  But we *can* agree Trump is a f*ckstick.",Trick-Sound-4461,2025-05-06T07:36:24,1
