What?!?!? Xi isn’t gonna just lay down?,Leraldoe,2025-04-07T20:19:54,1
"Why would they give in to him? They know he just started a trade war with the entire world. You want to negotiate from a position of power, pretty basic stuff. Of course they're going to let the world kick his (our) ass for a while.  and to the MAGA who think he's sticking it to everybody, who like the tough talk... He's signing you up for a fight dumbasses! He's not the one who's going to be fighting and ""toughing it out for a while."" He'll be golfing while you're trying to figure out how to buy groceries and pay your bills.",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T20:23:34,1
What’s wild is China holds all the cards and somehow the magas think that Trump will come out on top. This is literally the boss making a come back to the office mandate then everyone of value quitting except this time it’s in Trade.    The next several presidents will be apologizing for Trump every time they turn around,ParappaTheWrapperr,2025-04-07T20:22:41,1
"China will cut us off before they lose, they've starved their people in modern history to secure a better future for themselves in the past, and there's way more guns in the hands of Americans.",South-Rabbit-4064,2025-04-07T20:28:20,1

Surely this trade war won’t go like one of his bankrupted casinos!,Loud-Ad-2280,2025-04-07T20:22:54,1
"China doesn’t care about the tariffs. China will keep filling Walmart orders as long as Walmart is willing to tolerate the tariffs, until it all just implodes.  It’s cheap warfare.",ranchoparksteve,2025-04-07T20:46:38,1

So fucking dumb that I cut off all of the dumb family members ,Droopy1592,2025-04-07T20:25:36,1
And I truly hope Xi doesn’t. At this point I hope we are all paying double for everything so there is riots in the streets. Fuck this bullshit.,DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:20:52,1
"You’re sounding like a PANICAN right now, just take the medicine and everything will be fine /s",DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:29:37,1
"I'm arriving at that point too... It's not just a lack of intelligence and education, it's all the disrespect and arrogance, coupled with willful ignorance that I can't handle. It's too the point that there just isn't the minimum respect necessary to carry on a relationship with them anymore. Their views are stupid, immoral and they are in your face about it... What are we supposed to do?",No-Group-4504,2025-04-07T20:34:52,1
That's a truly sad mindset to have.,18212182,2025-04-07T20:30:37,1
"What a strange thing to say. You hope prices double so that homelessness and food insecurity rates, including among children, soar? Why on Earth wouldn't you hope for a diplomatic resolution and for Trump to feel the massive domestic backlash, including among his billionaire buddies, and back down?   The number of people who think this is a game astonishes me.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-04-07T20:31:45,1
It might be the only way we get change. I’m lucky to live with my parents rn and have my expenses covered but I can’t even imagine the suffering people living on their own are about to face,DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:32:32,1
We don’t. But it’s the only way to end this absolute atrocity that the US has become. It’s the only way this stops. ,Huge_Rich522,2025-04-07T21:19:16,1
That’s the problem. To many it is just a game ,Current_Animator7546,2025-04-07T21:27:19,1
"Fair enough, but I honestly hope that we don't have a recession, that Trump backs down. I know that it's unlikely to happen, but I wish more people were hopeful that things aren't completely fucked. Wishing for doom isn't the right way to think about it.",18212182,2025-04-07T20:34:41,1
"Thousands of children dying of starvation because ""everything costs double"" is not the ""only way to end"" a trade war. There is literally bipartisan legislation in Congress right now to curb Trump's tariffs powers. Perhaps hope they continue shortening the leash rather than for an outcome where hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of your fellow countrymen become homeless with no way to feed them all.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-04-07T21:25:31,1
"It's like some mental LARPing or cosplay. People don't seem to understand that they aren't cheering for the away team, they are cheering for millions of Americans to become homeless and thousands, including children, to die.   A cattle truck fell over in Argentina during (I believe) the early aughts. People were so hungry from rampant inflation that they ate the cows raw. This is not a game, and the true thing to hope for is a diplomatic offramp for all.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-04-07T21:28:29,1
"The problem is Trump doesn’t care about the average person, he’ll rather see everyone in this country starve to death than admit the tariffs are wrong and I wish I was exaggerating",DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:37:22,1
"Most of the time people on Reddit are doom and gloomers about most things, but this tariff shit is actually the most horrifying shit I’ve ever seen in my life",DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:41:26,1
The crimes against humanity in El Salvador I’d put just above tariffs.,kweathergirl,2025-04-07T20:46:25,1
"Yeah, honestly, if a trade war is the most horrifying thing you've seen in your life, you haven't been looking around.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-04-07T21:27:28,1
"At least the El Salvador stuff is happening (mostly) to criminals, this is Trump going to war against his own people",DoctorOctopus_,2025-04-07T20:48:11,1
