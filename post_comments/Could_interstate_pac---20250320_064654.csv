"retyped here for formatting issues:  ================================  Could interstate pacts replace federal departments?  The idea is to form interstate pacts for those states which want to keep the same policies, funding and functions as a substitute for federal departments. This would speak to the flexibility of the U.S. federated system as interstate compacts are agreements between two or more states that allow them to collaborate on issues of mutual concern. These agreements are legally binding and often require Congressional approval if they affect federal interests, although with the federal government receding, it would imply they have no interest.  In theory, states could form pacts to replicate the functions of certain federal departments that might be abolished or downsized. For example:  * Education: States could band together to maintain a unified set of educational standards, testing, and funding mechanisms.  * Environment: States could work collaboratively to manage environmental issues that cross state borders, such as air and water pollution or wildlife conservation.  * Transportation: States could pool resources for infrastructure projects like highways or public transit that extend beyond one state.  However, there are significant challenges. Federal departments often serve as central authorities that ensure uniformity and equity across the nation. Without this oversight, disparities could emerge between states. Moreover, the loss of federal funding and expertise might strain state resources, especially for smaller or less wealthy states, although since people live in states, if fired from federal jobs, their state might hire them into a comparable job, e.g. what New York is currently doing.",thewoodsiswatching,2025-03-20T19:10:45,8
"Oh, yes. This will definitely be simpler, cheaper, more flexible and more responsive to citizens than just, you know, having a Federal Dept.  It totally won't be confusing, self-conflicting, riddled with corruption, hopelessly unwieldy, or waste a ton of taxpayer money with little to no oversight.   Who takes this nonsense seriously?  Trump isn't destroying government institutions to make things better.  He (and Republicans in general) are destroying them to weaken the country so they can own it.",mtutty,2025-03-20T21:48:37,42
"Yes they already exist.  CARB (California Air Resource board) exists and 5 other states are members.  they have stricter rules than the EPA dictates, it just has to be funded from the member states.      you just wouldn't be able to re-create USAID or any agency that deals with other countries.  there might be some wiggle room there, but yes they can and do exist.",discourse_friendly,2025-03-20T23:11:31,7

"An issue is an interstate compact must be ratified by Congress, which would be a hurdle with the current Congress. Regardless, we have an Administration indicating its willingness to openly ignore court orders, so the rules are already a bit out the window. In light of that, States should enact and proceed with interstate compacts to maintain what we’ve built in this country regardless of whether Congress approves such compacts.",tonyt4nv,2025-03-20T21:34:15,3

"It’s certainly worth studying in detail. As for funding, that raises the question of where tax money should flow if the federal government is gutted. Which opens a whole can of worms.   I get the sense that you’re trying to find solutions that could be legitimate under the current government, which is both understandable and absurd. Any such solution will face the same opposition that Federal agencies have, because opposition is definitely not motivated by efficiency and economics.",ResurgentOcelot,2025-03-20T21:28:08,2

The 14th Amendment won’t be very helpful. Might as well dissolve the union.  The military is federal. Image needing a visa to travel to a neighboring state.  Imagine eCommerce governed by loads of state laws. Imagine your education being invalid in other states— or your marriage…. Imagine needing local currency.

Unlikely because states by law cannot default on their debt so they would not want to be on the hook for the actions by another state.   The ability to infinitely finance is why so many people like Federal programs.  It's as cost free as it can get.,JKlerk,2025-03-21T14:22:45,0

"No, Trump destroying things without understanding how they work first is the very definition of theory without evidence.  There is no alternative explanation that fits the facts.  And even if there is a colorable alternative motivation, IT DOES NOT MATTER, because the damage done to this country's  * reputation in the world * ability to project soft power * ability to compete with China and keep imperial Russia in a box * food and energy security * education system * natural resources and conservation * public health * debt/deficit control  will be absolutely decimated for at least 10-15 years.  Even if Democrats took control of everything tomorrow, it would take them 10 years to rebuild and fix things.    Doing that kind of permanent damage in just a couple of months in office took planning and coordination before Trump took office (P2025, Musk, Congress, SCOTUS).  And if any amount of Russian or Chinese influence was involved, that's straight-up treason.",mtutty,2025-03-23T08:20:28,2
"Clearly you've never been involved with inter-govt agreements before.  Compacts are already used heavily within states to let state/county/municipal entities share funding and resources on projects.  They \*can\* work well, but just as often they are fraught with bad-faith actions, waste/fraud/abuse issues, competition between groups, and normal political fuckery.    Oh, and they often have far less transparency than the entities that enter into them, because everyone gets to pretend it's someone else's job to report on things.  Having a single entity that everyone agrees to follow is the \*least bad\* way to get states to work together.  Pretending that any opt-in, mutual-aid approach would be better ignores history and current reality.",mtutty,2025-03-23T08:24:00,1

"Look, as someone in a blue state, I'd be okay. The blue states would form compacts, the red states would opt out and continue to become poorer, sicker, and less educated.  We are only IN this conundrum because we have allowed the gap between red and blue states, in terms of income, education, and healthcare, to become as wide as it already has.   Only because blue states subsidize red states have they not devolved further into poverty and ""low-information"" than they already have. If we can't resolve the education, Healthcare and income gaps we will surely end the Union.",Steve2982,2025-03-21T12:13:36,4

"The red states continue to perform poorly, not just because they unironically suckle at the blue-state teat.  It's mainly because they \*deny reality\* when it comes to what works and what doesn't in regards to education, economic development and generational mobility.  That same, well-established pattern of denialism and fantasy goal-seeking isn't gonna stop just because things get worse for them.  Letting the red states suffer would feel great (I'll admit it), but getting rid of the parental Federal government will just let those children run wild.    There'd be nothing to stop a group of red states from deciding that those pesky blues are doing them dirty, and straight start another civil war with whatever justification they drum up.  And before you scoff at the population gap between red and blues, let's be serious in all of the goofy theorizing and agree that red states would have no problem drafting the poors as cannon fodder, whereas the blue states wouldn't.",mtutty,2025-03-23T08:29:39,1
