">Acting head of FEMA ousted one day after saying he is against eliminating agency  I don't understand how these agencies can just be 'deleted' or 'eliminated' when it needs to be done through the legislative process starting with Congress.  So he's getting fired, essentially because this administration is just a bunch of idiotic conspiracy theorists, religious theocratic wackjobs, and MAGA power hungry to just hate and be racists openly.    I cannot wrap my head around those that support this agency being abandonded.  Helping people in crisis and saving lives after a natural disaster that takes away everything you own? Missing loved ones? Rebuilding?  Just amazing to think that states could bear the brunt of the destruction caused by natural disasters that progressively gets worse. I almost feel like Trump just doesn't want to deal with it - too much work and too many phone calls, I guess.   Unless it's for people to beg to him since that's a thing, but seeing him tell Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders ""no"" twice?  Yea, they're hoarding the money or putting it into one of his cypto slush funds or something.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-08T14:55:53,3
