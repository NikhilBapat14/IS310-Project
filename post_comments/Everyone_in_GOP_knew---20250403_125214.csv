"What Rich and Poweful Republicans are NOT Saying:  My profit margins/stocks are going to be gravely affected because we can try to pass on all the increases to the Middle and Lower Classes, but eventually they‚Äôre going to stop buying stuff! THEN my wealth is affected!  Will the Top Managers (CEO,CFO‚Ä¶etc.) take salary cuts? Or will they simply cut employees and our stock profits??  DON‚ÄôT HURT US, THE FILTHY RICH, OR OUR NARCISSISTIC POWER OVER MOST OF AMERICANS!!  P.S. Trump and His FAMILY are making  MILLIONS Upon MILLIONS right now.

"Why aren‚Äôt the House Dems fighting to rein it in like the Senate is? This won‚Äôt just hurt Trump. Even with a massive win in 2026, these countries won‚Äôt come back.

"Funny thing is tariffs are good when wisely applied. These blanket tariffs defeat the purpose of using targeted tariffs and just punish the people. The ONLY ones benefiting from this are the billionaires who will buy up what folks WILL HAVE to sell for cheap when they go bankrupt. Happens every recession and depression.  Its one of the reasons why they get wealthier and we get poorer.  Then business will be back on with China, and they'll point to this time period as why we can not change it. The thing that really pisses me off here is that. Because I believe in tariffs. I believe China is ruining us. I also believe that Trumps insanity will destroy a large part of what's left of the middle class. Tariffs are already becoming a curse word among democrats who don't remember the Biden or Obama tariffs to target specific industries to help things like tire manufacturing. The SAME way we have a kneejerk reaction to ""socialism"" as a consequence of the red scare.",ABadHistorian,2025-04-03T16:43:53,3

"The politician that proposed making Trump Derangement Syndrome into a mental illness [was, around the time he suggested it, subject to a police investigation because he had gone online and talked to someone he believed was a 17 year-old child prostitute.
