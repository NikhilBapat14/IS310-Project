"It‚Äôs amazing these judges have no regard for established laws to which they swore an oath to uphold.  And before anyone starts blasting me with excuses and reasoning as to why this judge can be an activist judge if she chooses. Here is the judges oath of office:  I, ______________ [insert federal judge‚Äôs name], do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all duties incumbent upon me as _______________ [insert office] under the Constitution and laws of the United States; and that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.   Also to all those who say that being an illegal alien is not a crime:  Federal Law: Entering or re-entering the United States without authorization is a federal crime. This is outlined in Title 8 of the U.S. Code, specifically sections 1325 and 1326.",Iamstillhere44,2025-04-25T09:46:23,240

Hey lib lurkers THIS is obstruction of justice. ¬†Not whatever you imagine President Trump does,More_Buy_550,2025-04-25T10:02:57,265
"Excellent, keep going Kash and Daniel, great work here!  Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction ‚Äî after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week.  We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject ‚Äî an illegal alien ‚Äî to evade arrest.  Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he‚Äôs been in custody since, but the Judge‚Äôs obstruction created increased danger to the public.  Among other things, this is the JOB of the FBI.  Public officials take notice before you decide to commit your crimes that lurk in your head.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T09:46:57,73

Leftists are cheering for judicial corruption by advocating for judges to not sentence any of their judge friends. Judicial corruption has been a long term plan of the left to override democracy by legislating from the bench.,kaytin911,2025-04-25T18:41:42,11

"Its one thing for these judges to declare injunctions or other legal recourses for illegal aliens to have their ""due process"" and it's another thing entirely to literally sneak a federal fugitive out the backdoor of your court room to avoid ICE in the lobby.
