"Yes. Eugene Debs ran from jail.  But this is completely unprecedented. The state governor would almost certainly issue a pardon, as it would be incredibly controversial to not do so.  In the UK the Houses of Parliament can order a prisoner to be brought to them.",Razakel,2022-08-12T18:14:13,27
"Legally, there's nothing against the idea. Practically, it would be very interesting in the case of Donald Trump's second term in office. He was barely able to cobble together a functional administration when he was actually in the White House. Given his poor leadership and complete inability to effectively delegate authority, I think it would mean that we would be almost without an executive branch for as long as he was an incarcerated president",Blear,2022-08-12T18:38:43,10
"***NO!***  * State governors have zero authority over federal issues.  No governor could pardon a sitting president.  It'd make great fictional theater but have zero relevance to the Constitution. * It is not fully clear a president can pardon themselves.  It's never been tested.  Likely the Congress and the Supreme Court would find that the Constitution does NOT provide for such power.  The power of the president to pardon is NEARLY absolute and remains vague. * If Trump is convicted in a State court that would very likely fall under the clause ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" and could not serve as president. * If Trump is found guilty of espionage, then that would fall under ""treason"" and likewise he could not serve.  Short answer => ***NO!***",Yggdrssil0018,2022-08-12T22:07:12,8

"Yes. The Constitution establishes the qualifications for president. No federal law can change these qualifications either by subtracting from them or by *adding* to them. This makes the office of President different from other elected positions which a person can be disqualified from by committing “high crimes and misdemeanors.”  The Constitution establishes only 3 qualifications for someone to serve as President: 1) the person is natural born US citizen, 2) the person has lived in the US for at least 14 years, and 3) the person is at least 35 years old when they’re sworn in as President. **Anyone** who meets these 3 qualifications is eligible to be President, regardless of whether they’re in prison or what crime they were convicted of.",percussaresurgo,2022-08-13T13:50:55,1

"Honestly, what 'should' happen may or may not happen. Years ago, I asked on stack exchange if a sitting president could be imprisoned. I was told that if a president did do something worthy of imprisonment, he would probably be removed from office before actually being imprisoned. Thus, it was a moot point. Clearly that assessment didn't age well.   That said, being president while sitting in a cell would be quite impractical. I mean, they would have to be bringing confidential documents into a public prison, and even discussing highly sensitive topics there. And surely the whole thing would be a nightmare for the president's security. It would all be rather silly really. More than likely they would either somehow free him, or just go find someone else to be president. Its highly unlikely someone would be allowed to rule while sitting in a cell.   Also, people who have served time or paid fines or whatnot aren't barred from holding office. George Bush Jr got in trouble for drunk driving once, and he was still able to stay in office for two terms (of course, granted that was because his opponent conceded before they even started counting the votes in the 2004 election). He also wasn't the first president with a record to hold office. Of course, its normally minor offenses from my understanding, but still there's no law saying someone like that can't hold office. There is a law saying people who have committed certain crimes like 'sedition' or treason can't hold office. However, this isn't in the constitution, which has lead some people to claim that in reality such a law isn't enforceable. Either way, as far as I'm aware its never been tested; no felon has ever become president, let alone someone who did the stuff Trump is being accused of. There was a felon some years ago who did try to run for some office (he ran a coal company where some of his miners died in a mine collapse due to his negligence, he seriously even served time for it). He was allowed to run, though he obviously didn't win election. Either way, he was already freed by the time he tried to run, so he wouldn't have been holding his position while sitting in a cell.",[deleted],2022-08-16T19:02:54,1

Now that Trump is no longer president, federal law applies to him without question.    We have 2 years in which to complete any  legal actions against Trump.

Look, I agree that the ideal situation would be to say to the public, ""Here's what he did,"" and to have everyone choose not to vote for him. But that's not going to happen.

"matts2 - please note the phrase ""and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust ...""  Here is the federal law on this, 18 U.S. Code § 2071 ""Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.   (b)Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.""  So, if Trump gets convicted in a state court, NY, GA, doesn't matter, he has violated 18 U.S. Code § 2071.  That sets up a problem with the Constitution which only lists three requirements to be president; natural born, 35 years of age, 14 years continuous legal resident.    Would a convicted Trump face a legal challenge to be ELIGIBLE to run?  Yes.  The federal courts would have to rule on this and I think it's highly likely they rule against a convicted felon being able to run for president.  If allowed, would a convicted Trump get votes?  Yes!  Would a convicted Trump win the presidency?  No.  Would a convicted Trump split the GOP wide open?  Yes.  There really is no path a convicted Trump would have that allows him to run, let alone become president again.  Great discussion by the way.  Thank you.",Yggdrssil0018,2022-08-13T13:33:28,1
"Let's posit this out.  Trump is convicted in state court, NY, GA, doesn't matter, of a felony crime.

As used in this subsection, the term “office” does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States.""  This would also be a constitutional problem because the Constitution says there are only 3 requirements to be president (natural born, 35 years of age, 14 years legal resident) and so even if convicted Trump would file suit which the federal courts would have to rule on.  Would a convicted Trump get votes?  Sure!  Would a convicted Trump likely win the presidency?  No!  Would a convicted Trump split the GOP wide open?  Yes.  There is no scenario in which a convicted Trump gets to become president for Congress to act and Congress would still have to follow the ONLY rules it has and that is impeachment.
