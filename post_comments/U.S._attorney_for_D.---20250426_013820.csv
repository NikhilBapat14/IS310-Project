"""Before being named U.S. attorney, Martin appeared on Russia-backed media networks more than 150 times, The Washington Post reported last week. In one appearance on RT in 2022, he said there was no evidence of military buildup on Ukraine’s boarders only nine days before Russia invaded the country. He further criticized U.S. officials as warmongering and ignoring Russia security concerns.""",Doener23,2025-04-26T01:40:16,64
It would take no time at all to move Wikipedia(Wikimedia) out of the US.   Is that their goal?  Make conditions so business-hostile that companies leave the country?  And you can't even pretend you can force them back with tariffs on Wikipedia page views.,NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-26T02:01:27,25

Imagine if besides 'English' and 'Simple English' there would also be a version of Wikipedia in 'Republican English'.  It's already a more or less full-time job to keep track of the number of lies Trump releases into the wild. Imagine what kind of lethal jungle a Republican Wikipedia would be for the concept of 'truth'.,HumanWithComputer,2025-04-26T09:02:49,2
"“At the heart of the dispute — and the lead defendant in the case — was Ed Martin, a lawyer by training and a political operative by trade.

"It's already happening with tech companies. Companies based in the US can't build their products and ship them to the US anymore since the tariffs make operations impossible, even on slim margins. Which ironically makes it so that US companies sell their products to anyone EXCEPT Americans. The alternative is closing up shop. So instead of creating jobs, your administration effectively cut jobs (on top of the thousands of government jobs being slashed).",Fazgo,2025-04-26T05:59:37,8
