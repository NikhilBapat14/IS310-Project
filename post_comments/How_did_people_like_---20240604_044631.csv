"I'm not well versed in it, but I'll try as I can.  I think the two situations are too dissimilar for any sort of copying attempt.  One importnat factor is time, especially time without problematic incidents creating division.  The swiss had hundreds of years of history and non-infighting to develop the identity over.  Also, while they had different language, they weren't being heavily influenced by a neighboring power of that language resulting in language based local factions supported by outside powers.    The inherent mountainousness of switzerland also made it less prone to invasion, as well as the protection of being part of the holy roman emperor.   The issues in cyprus are too recent, recent ethnic tensions don't go away readily.  It takes many decades without an issue, and without anyone inflaming the issue for political gain.  It also helps if they have outside powers to band together against.",zlefin_actual,2024-06-06T13:04:28,1
"So the most basic answer is time? We also lived together isolated from any direct mainland influence for many many years before anything happened. But I guess it's difficult to develop a national identity under colonial rule, especially since we've only been a country for 60 years.",BrodoSaggins,2024-06-06T15:25:50,1
"I'm not sufficiently expert to say with confidence, but my impression is that time is the biggest factor.  At least time without ongoing incidents; there's plenty of places where the 'ongoing incidents' go back hundreds or thousands of years, and that history keeps them hostile to each other and prevents formation of a joint identity.  But it's also the case that even if an issue has been dormant for a long time, sometimes nationalist or religious politicians will stoke a division that hadn't had major issues recently.  It is indeed hard to develop a national identity under colonial rule, especially if the colonizers are of a same grouping; and for much of its history it was ruled by either greek (byzantine) or turkic (ottoman) rulers.",zlefin_actual,2024-06-06T16:35:46,1
"I'm not sure if Byzantines were Greeks in the sense that the concept of Greece didn't exist then as it does now. I am aware they really admired Greek people and took a lot of things from Greek culture but Im not sure if they were actually Greeks. Also during Byzantine rule we were ruled by Arabs as well in a condominium, so I'm not sure of the validity of your last paragraph.   Just to clarify I'm simply continuing the discussion and that you have shed some light on certain points I didn't consider.",BrodoSaggins,2024-06-07T04:22:43,1
