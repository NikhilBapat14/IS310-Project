"War is coming.   Wiping your ass with the UN charter, withdrawing from the role of de-facto world leader, and accepting forced annexation as a legitimate war goal, all have consequences.   Every two-bit dictator will want to re-evaluate past treaties and settle past scores, now that there is nothing to stop them other than their own perceived power. Ukraine and Gaza are just the beginning. There will be a cascade series of conflicts all over the world, and while they may not have the same unified structure as a World war, nor necessarily go nuclear, by the end of it, the cumulative destruction and changed world order, will be comparable. Except the changes will most certainly not be for the better.",GeneReddit123,2025-04-30T02:38:49,8

"The military-industrial complex is jumping for joy and will fan the flame of war. As the world turns to shit I am very glad to be far away in Australia.   Canadians and Europeans must be justifiably nervous , especially in the Baltic states. Draft aged Americans should also be worried as , unlike during the Vietnam War , Canada no longer provides a safe haven.  That NATO is now infiltrated by a dysfunctional and expansionist failed state is of great concern. Especially so if the US makes a move on Canada and its signatories are compelled to join in its defence.  Taiwan will likely fall to China but I expect that it will stop there and very much doubt that it wants to expand beyond its historical borders.  North Korea is , despite the rhetoric, unlikely to move on the South.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-30T03:54:31,2
