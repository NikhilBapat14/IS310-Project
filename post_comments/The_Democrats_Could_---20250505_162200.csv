">Launched in January, Plan Mexico offers a sweeping vision for sustainable development. By 2030, it aims to create 1.5 million new jobs, train 150,000 skilled workers annually, and increase domestic content requirements, i.e., the percentage of components of a finished product that are sourced from Mexico. The plan, which includes textiles and pharmaceuticals, lays out detailed goals for specific sectors, targeting not only the development of homegrown supply chains but an expansion of the domestic market for those products, as well. A sizable portion focuses on energy and E.V.s. As part of an effort to reduce reliance on imported oil and gas, for instance—Mexico imports 70 percent of its gas from the United States—the plan aims to generate 45 percent of power from renewables by 2030.   >“Plan Mexico is the path that I am certain will lead us to a Mexico with more well-paid jobs, with less poverty and inequality, with greater investment and production, with more innovation,” Sheinbaum has said, and “with a lower carbon footprint that respects the environment and increases our self-sufficiency and sovereignty.”",tech57,2025-05-05T17:23:14,4

"The article is not a joke. Mexico is emulating China.  >Alonso Romero, an adviser to the Sheinbaum campaign, told me that the ability to do more holistic planning is especially important for wind and solar. The government can craft and implement its energy plans more easily, and private developers can know exactly how much transmission capacity is available for them to connect to the grid—an ongoing problem for renewables in the U.S. “They are going to know exactly how much generation capacity can be built, and how much can be integrated into the transmission lines that are nearby. Because that planning goes hand-in-hand with Plan Mexico, they’ll know there’s going to be demand,” he said. “They’re not going to have to wait to see if a line is going to be built.” (Romero is the vice president of commercial strategy for CFE, but he spoke to me in a personal capacity.)  >Bidenomics and Plan Mexico may share similar goals, but they are premised on a wildly different theory of politics. With a razor-thin congressional majority, Biden’s tariffs and tax breaks were meant to nudge the private sector to simultaneously deliver export dominance, economic progress, and votes. In contrast, by the time Sheinbaum took office, Morena had “demonstrated to the people that if the government intervenes in the market and imposes conditions, they’re going to have a better life,” as Romero put it. “Industrial policy builds on that trust.” Like the Olinia project, the future of Plan Mexico remains to be seen. What’s clear, though, is that Mexico’s voters have granted Sheinbaum and Morena as robust a democratic mandate as any government could hope for to drive forward an ambitious, twenty-first-century developmentalist project: to pass ambitious legislation that supports the project’s goals, experiment with new forms of economic governance, and build lots and lots of stuff.",tech57,2025-05-05T17:21:30,11

"I see this narrative pop up a lot, but I’m not convinced by it. To me, blaming Harris' loss on her campaigning with Liz Cheney feels less like a serious analysis of the election and more like a kind of moral theater. Basically it's liberals expressing discomfort with any rapprochement, however tactical, with former adversaries (like Iraq War supporters), and expecting their personal discomfort to be reflected in electoral outcomes based on the choices of independents and conservatives.  The campaign’s logic for bringing Cheney on board was clear (although ultimately wrong): she offered a way to reach disaffected conservatives - voters who might be open to turning away from Trump but who wouldn’t hear that message from traditional liberal voices or the mainstream media. Cheney’s purported credibility came from her prominent role on the January 6 Committee and her willingness to publicly break with Trump. She’s also articulate and arguably had a very specific kind of appeal to that narrow target audience.  As for the backlash, I think liberal distaste over the optics probably had only a marginal effect, if any. Gaza was a much bigger factor on the left.  The idea that a significant number of GOP-leaning voters were ready to vote for Harris until they were repelled by her association with Liz Cheney is basically laughable. This cohort simply does not exist in any meaningful numbers. That's not to say modern conservatives and fellow travelers like the cast of neo-con characters from the Bush era, including the Cheneys. Obviously they don't. But there is no meaningful cohort of principled anti-war Trump voters who are actually looking at the world in these terms motivated by the same moral disgust that liberals feel about Cheney.",Immediate_Compote743,2025-05-05T20:37:12,11
You could ask the average voter about Liz Cheney and they'd probably have no clue who she is outside vaguely remembering Dick Cheney.

I feel like I’m living in a bizarro universe. I’ve never seen so many “progressives” go out of their way to trash their closest political allies instead of focusing on republicans.   Progressive ideals will never happen in this country unless they vote reliably and support the candidate closest to their ideals. It’s literally that simple.,FailedInfinity,2025-05-05T22:31:35,4

"The only sense I can make of it is that they care more about being perceived as progressive instead of actually behaving in the classic sense of the word.  Otherwise, I can't fathom the vitriol they've slung at the Dems despite all the headway they've made for the disadvantaged and minority groups.  Yeah, I always hear that ""it's not enough,"" but it's tangibly more than Republicans give us.",Turok7777,2025-05-06T00:08:53,3
"\>Progressive ideals will never happen in this country unless they vote reliably and support the candidate closest to their ideals. It’s literally that simple.  I'm almost 30 and voting Dem has not once in my lifetime worked as a strategy for enacting progressive policies. For how many more decades am I going to have to listen to Dems shit on leftists  for their own party's strategic failures? I'm about as left as it gets and I (and all of my friends) voted for Harris. This shit is so patronizing.   I've watched for the last 100 days as the vast majority of Dems remained (and continue to remain) as silent as possible on trans issues because it's viewed as politically risky while Republicans continue to strip our rights away. While Republicans are continually allowed to dominate the discussion on trans issues. I watch time and time again as Republicans fearmonger about my right to access healthcare while Dems offer no robust counter-narrative because they're terrified of losing the votes of moderates.  So no, I'm not going to keep my mouth shut, sorry. I'm tired of being told to shut up and sing the praises of a party that illustrates time and time again that it barely gives a fuck about minorities beyond its ability to court their votes on the basis of damage control. Maybe stop blaming people for criticizing a party that's failing to protect them. Maybe take a note from your own book and focus on Republicans instead of trashing your political allies. Maybe stop trying to shield your party from criticism.",Kropatrick,2025-05-06T02:19:59,1

“Almost 30” isn’t that old lol. In fact you are quite young. Have you ever voted in a presidential election where Trump wasn’t on the ballot?,snowstorm608,2025-05-06T07:02:40,2
"“Almost 30” isn’t really that old when it comes to having a larger perspective on how this country operates.   What you’re failing to realize is that trans rights are a recent circumstance. Before that it was the fight for gay/lesbian rights, civil rights, and women’s rights. The more progressive a society becomes, the more we can focus on lifting up smaller segments of the population.   Since Republicans have come into power, they have enacted a massive regressive policy. Dems still care about trans rights, but they are currently insignificant compared to the rights of women, black people, and immigrants which make up a much larger proportion of this country and economy. Our current president is aiming for people that aren’t straight, white, and Christian.   If you still want to complain about Democrats, then exercise your first amendment right. I also have the right to say you are short sighted and naïve.",FailedInfinity,2025-05-06T09:20:06,1
