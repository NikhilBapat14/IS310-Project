"When it comes to maga, every compromise just gives them another pressure point to flex on. You compromised on abortion, but they outlawed it and closed all the clinics anyways. You compromised on border security, now they are out snatching people that “fit the profile” and deporting them before you can even have a news report they were taken. Compromised on religious exemptions to vaccines, now brain worm has started a war on autism which will without a shadow of doubt lead to total vaccine ban in the fall, followed by the most brutal flu season this country will experience in a long time.

"Reading the article I found the reference to Teddy Roosevelt and his notion of “masculine politics” interesting.   In a perfect world I think I’d rather have feminine politics. But the political world we are living in right now is about as far from perfect as it gets.  Envisioning the D party being led by a Teddy Roosevelt “masculine politics” style of leadership… I can envision it winning.   Everything else right now? I, regrettably, can only envision it losing.   I’m more than willing to be Machiavellian at this moment. Beyond that, I think the moment we are in DEMANDS that.  And if “masculine politics” is what it takes to win? Fine. Done. Sign me up.  Beyond that, looking to fascist and authoritarian movements throughout history… they manage to seize power and control a people in their vice by cornering the market on masculinity.   If they cannot be out-masculined? They cannot be stopped.   A Churchill can beat them at their own game. Bolder. Braver. Willing to go harder.   A Chamberlain cannot. Softer. More genteel. Seeking conciliation but NOT ever willing to go harder.   With history as my guide, I believe it’s Churchill time. It’s Teddy time.   And being the first leader to recognize this? I do believe it’s now Pritzker time.  JB is the leader of the party, as far as I’m concerned… and I think we should all throw our shoulders behind the guy unless/until a better option emerges.   I’m skeptical a better option will, so I’ll be throwing whatever weight I’ve got into the big guy from Illinois.",-Gramsci-,2025-05-01T20:37:47,5

He's a billionaire, which means on the one hand he has financial security that most of his colleagues don't share.

It seems that the way reddit works these days, I need to also make a clarification that I wholeheartedly support JB. I totally hope him and AOC team up for the presidency.

"I have been thinking about that a lot recently. It’s wild to me how much conservatives could/can hate dems when Dems are constantly voting for their bills and confirming their nominations. Or like you said wanting to be nice to right wing politicians who have been blocking them at every turn and undermining the constitution. Why do that?  Democratic voters will vote third party or even conservative if they don’t like their rep, to punish the democrats, but conservatives seem to vote red no matter what imo. So it would stand to reason that conservatives only win in some cases because voters of other parties are willing to vote conservative in some cases. And I think most “left leaning” people see the dems as a more center right party in the first place. So yeah confuses me why Conservative and Republicans hate democrats when they are essentially the right hand of the conservative government that is the U.S. currently. They helped weaken the system that the orange emperor is breaking.   That’s why even as the constitution is thrown out the window there is still a lower approval rating with dems. [Democrats’ approval remains at low point: Poll](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/5224072-democrats-low-approval-rating/)  They should start acting towards republicans the way Moscow Mitch would and bring everything to a halt.

This is also the point that most Dems who talk about politics paid attention to what she was saying. It's this stuff that was fresher and more compelling and indicative of ""a good/fine campaign"".  **After** Biden stepped out and she became the nominee, her campaign staff took on a ton of (Hillary) Clinton and Biden staffers and the strategy and messaging changed markedly.

"You cannot win by following polling.  If you could, Democrats have been closer to the median voter polling for decades now, this would be reflected in results.  Your fundamental assumptions are wrong and we're all paying for it.",guamisc,2025-05-01T20:54:26,7

"You are a ""professional"" who is telling me that i'm wrong but lazily giving nothing and basically arguing that the party should not just disregard, but move in opposition to, the clear verdict from polling and election results. If one like yourself really is a Democratic political professional, doesn't it explain a lot?",oldspice75,2025-05-02T09:39:43,-1
"The idea that voters will follow any policy that you happen to think is right if it's communicated optimally is delusional. If a party veers left while its voters stay in place or veer right, what happens? Our recent past, that's what",oldspice75,2025-05-02T09:26:40,0
"The other guy literally yielded that there weren't huge numbers with religious conservatives, but there were numbers. I added on that those numbers were larger than any centrist Democrat to highlight that shitty Dem policy (that changes nothing materially) doesn't impress a group of generally poor, uneducated people desperate and hungry for change.",happymage102,2025-05-02T17:51:44,1
"Did I say ***any*** policy? No.  You have to counter the billions in right-wing propaganda, not simply drift right slowly to be ""moderate"". If you're not driving public opinion, you're losing. And you're advocating for following public opinion while the conservatives have spent billions upon billions to change it. Literally the dumbest thing I can think of.  Our recent past is entirely due to the ineffective fecklessness of moderate leadership for decades.",guamisc,2025-05-02T09:44:19,1

"We are not going to match the GOP propaganda machine, or come close. That's one reason that we pay a higher cost for straying left of where our actual base is. And voters are simply more hesitant to veer to the left than they are to the right  Your opinion that moderation is the problem is wishful thinking, while the evidence suggests the opposite",oldspice75,2025-05-02T10:00:56,1
1. Moderates have been largely in charge for decades.  2. They keep losing to increasingly bad Republicans.  3.

"By your standard moderates are in charge maybe but the party has in fact, [moved steadily and substantially left](https://www.slowboring.com/p/shifting-left) since Obama won. All strong and recent evidence suggests that the party has moved left while their voters were not moving in concert, allowing the GOP to rebound and chip away at the Democratic base  The Democratic party has been appeasing its intellectual vanguard and its donor class rather than its actual base, which is moderate. The left remains quite small (and not well distributed for the electoral college)  Your answer to this problem is to double down on ""customer is wrong"" and make the damage to the brand even worse. That willfully blind strategy is a gift for Trump and Putin",oldspice75,2025-05-02T13:06:36,1
"You're preaching the same bullshit I've heard all my adult life. Sorry not buying it anymore. Hilarious that moderates are chased out every time they are in power in order to replace them with ""change"" candidates because moderates are ineffectual hacks, but you wanna sit here an say that it is I who thinks the ""customer is wrong"".  The Democratic party has not been ""appeasing"" the left. It takes almost every chance to refuse to do except on corporate acceptable social issues. Saying nice words but refusing to back them up is why people are pissed at the party.  Get on the bus or get out of the way, fuck moderates and this hellhole they've led us to.",guamisc,2025-05-02T13:42:59,1
"""Change"" candidates are the real hacks. There is nothing more perennial or more commonplace than ""exciting"" politicians who are different from the rest of the politicians  You sound like you think this is about you deserving the politics that you want to finally succeed because you've waited so long and paid your dues for that. It doesn't work that way  You are, in fact, saying that the customer is wrong. Clearly the evidence suggests that the Democratic party is appeasing its progressive flank more than it's appeasing the voters, who are not so progressive and who found the current party unacceptably leftwing and radical compared to Trump's GOP according to the outcome and to various consistent polls. That is what happened.  The answer to that is not to move further left. Again, self identified liberals and the further left all together comprise about 25% of voters. The internet bubble that you see represents something smaller than itself, not larger. What if the voters do not want to push the envelope further left? Is that so surprising? If people have to choose between left-of-Biden and Trump, we are highly likely to get Trump (or his even worse successor). And after that you probably won't have to stress about elections  Who led us into a hellhole? Those who leaned toward Trump, as opposed to not getting to own the libs, which includes plenty of the left. For the most part, it wasn't the moderates who were trashing Clinton and Biden and thereby elevating Trump. It's the quixotic malcontent left, the ""uncommitted"" and the Chappell Roans of the world (""vote small""). They could have just remembered that it's all about stopping more Republican judges for another few years at a time and fighting to hold the level of democracy that we have, not the utopias of an imaginary voting pool that resembles themselves",oldspice75,2025-05-04T08:46:26,1
