"""The nation, she warned, was at risk of a constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to stand up to the president — or if the president defies them nonetheless.    “That is a crisis that will eventually impact everyone,” she said. “Because it would mean that the rules that protect our fundamental rights and freedoms, that ensure each of us has a say in how our government works, will no longer matter.”""",RobAbiera,2025-05-01T08:09:43,18

"1,000% agree. I voted for her and I would vote for her again, but the country has shown us who they are. We are not ready for a woman of color to be the President yet. Maybe it’ll be possible in a decade or three, but I worry if they try to run her in 2028, assuming we have elections still, she will lose!",BigAddam,2025-05-01T09:29:56,13
I’d also rather they tell me what useful things they’ll do in power,xixanosike,2025-05-01T08:28:49,3
So much this. It's like Biden warning that Trump is an existential threat and then inviting him into the whitehouse with open arms and a smile. ,Bakedads,2025-05-01T08:44:54,3
"What we keep hearing is _risk of_ when America is in the middle of one.   No, the democrats have twice run a woman against Trump and lost. When they ran an old man, they won convincingly. Sorry ladies but the lesson is obvious.",LookOverall,2025-05-01T09:51:07,0
"GDP going in verse, inflation going up, trillions lost in the stock market, unemployment hitting record numbers, burning bridges with global allies, and corporations saying that shelves will be empty in like 2 weeks time. Yet somehow we dodged a bullet by ensuring that we didn't vote for the competent adult? Yeah ok at this point I hope they cut your steak before you eat it because I worry that you might choke.",Responsible-Pain-620,2025-05-01T09:20:35,6
"Yep. The democrats won’t learn. Bernie is old. AOC should be the runner. That fucking lich Pelosi will kneecap her.   They will run Kamala or Newsom, and will lose miserably as “return to normal” will be the motto. We don’t want normal, normal fucking sucked too!",zffjk,2025-05-01T10:02:11,8

you really think someone who still has a problem voting for a woman or a minority candidate is ever going to vote democrat? This is delusional. Clinton and Harris lost because they were awful candidates who failed to present a coherent vision for the future. They ran as status quo candidates in a period where the vast majority of people are struggling under the status quo.,cat-flavored,2025-05-01T11:41:58,2
"The centrist dems plan to contain the fire the best they can. But don’t you remember how limited democrats are when in power? There is the parliamentarian, and then the archivist, and also don’t forget about one or two senators who will appear and stop any thing that helps the working class substantially. And the leader of the party, whichever centrist it will be, will throw their hands up and say there’s just nothing they can do. And a lot democrats here in this sub will say the president has little power!  Wouldn’t that be crazy?",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T08:45:13,0
