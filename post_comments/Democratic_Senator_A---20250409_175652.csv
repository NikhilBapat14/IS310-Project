"He specifically said ""IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT' which is the stock symbol for Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. He thinks he's being fucking cute here.

"Every democrat needs to stop their own insider trading right now. So many of them are so ethically blind that they don't even see it as a problem. Fortunately, there are at least a few of them that understand. GOP is a lost cause however.",TinFoilBeanieTech,2025-04-09T18:48:12,9

This makes me sad.  I love Adam Schiff.  But when he did this my first thought was “give it a rest…nobody cares.”  That’s when I realized how badly e.g. Trump administration has demoralized me.  I hate this time line.,Able-Campaign1370,2025-04-09T23:32:19,3

"   The furious pace of deregulation is gutting agencies intended to protect ordinary Americans, consumer advocates say. But business groups have long favored regulatory relief.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/trump-deregulation-firing.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/13/business/trump-deregulation-firing.html)  The moves have led the S.E.C. to pull back on its attempt to police the cryptocurrency boom and upended efforts at other agencies to protect worker rights.The speed and scale of the deregulatory moves by President Trump reflect his ambitious agenda to downsize government.But the upshot of all this upheaval is simple: Regulatory agencies that are intended to protect ordinary Americans, workers and homeowners are being gutted, consumer advocates say.",shadowpawn,2025-04-09T23:47:06,1

Monday there was a rumor of a 90 day pause then the White House came out and was absolute and said there will be no pause and said it was fake news. It’s pretty obvious there was a dump and then pump.,Peteostro,2025-04-09T18:53:44,27
"It's not even hidden. A supposedly fake tweet yesterday saying tarriffs were being canceled caused a rapid market spike over 15 minutes. It was quickly called fake news. But, it's clear in hindsight they were testing the waters and seeing how quickly and strongly the market would react. With clear evidence it would cause a massive spike, they regrouped, but out tons of news about reciprocal tarriffs, watched the market drop all night, then started buying up massive amounts this AM before releasing the pause.",hirasmas,2025-04-09T20:26:50,14

Hello fellow Okie! I wonder if it might have to do with the fact that 4/19 is the bombing anniversary. I don't know if that would have anything to do with it or not it's just a thought.,stacie2410,2025-04-10T00:14:39,5
"They tested the waters. The stock shot up on the rumor they spread. Then he officially said it was just a rumor and the S&P touched bear market territory and everything else shot down. 20 minutes before the news hit today the stock spiked, but slipped a little down, then mooned. No one knew what was going on. Then the news finally broke.    Scott Bessent then made the mistake of saying this was always the plan.  Oops.
