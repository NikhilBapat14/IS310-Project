"Gorsuch is not a hero in the same way I'm not a hero for wiping my ass after I take a shit. Doing the bare minimum does not make one a hero. He can do his job, or become a cog in the fascist machine taking over the country. We all know at the end of the day he's more likely to go the easy route, which is total capitulation to trump.",LW_GLAZER,2025-04-29T11:02:58,21

"Gorsuch is one of five theocon Catholics chosen by Paul Weyrich and Leonard Leo to turn our country into a theocratic aristocratic authoritarian oligarchy.   “originalism” came from Bork and Scalia, both chosen by Weyrich. Bork was so extreme not even Republicans supported his nomination. In fact “originalism” means choosing or ignoring parts of the Constitution, amendments and precedent decisions to advance a theofascist agenda.",jpurdy,2025-04-29T22:59:29,1
"I will give credit to Gorsuch for his pretty definitive stance that discrimination against LGBT people is unconstitutional because it 100% of the time is sex discrimination   Like, he's right, and it's so simple, but it is astonishing how few people on his side accept that Americans have equal rights.",PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-29T12:23:44,3
"It's a bit lazy to lump Gorsuch in with Thomas or whoever the other one is. IDK. IDC. Those two are ideological hacks who don't even try to hide that they make partisan decisions for partisan reasons.   Gorsuch, whether you like how he rules or not, actually has beliefs about American law and jurisprudence and something of a rationale to explain them. He's been a bit of an odd duck ever since he came out as a advocate for Native American rights, where he was often a swing vote in the favor of tribal issues and concerns. While he frequently voted against Biden's presidency, most of his written opinions on why lack the bullshit reasoning Thomas would shit onto the page and call intelligent.   There's a reason Gorsuch isn't the right-wing's favorite justice; he's too old school Federalist Society for the current MAGA crop. And there's a reason he's not the left's favorite justice either. Because he is old school Federalist Society.   As it stands, of the 9 Supreme Court judges, Gorsuch is one of only 4 who are worthy of the position. I don't count the other five, because four of them are hacks and John Roberts has been spinning in his own circles for too long to realize he's lead the court off the exact cliff he most wanted it not to go off.",Lord0fHats,2025-04-29T11:14:36,2

"Neutered and useless is not what I would call the group that killed Roe v Wade and will kill Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell next.  More like ""evil"" and ""an active enemy to the continuation of the Union""",PhoenixTineldyer,2025-04-29T11:08:03,7
This court is rather the opposite of neutered in my opinion. They are very busy at work tearing apart decades of precedent and progress as they march along with the aim to destroy democracy while also finding every which way to further subjugate the non rich elite.,zeroaffect,2025-04-29T22:42:02,1
Did he say under oath that Roe v. Wade was settled law? And how did he vote in the Dobbs decision?  You wanna try again?,Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-04-29T11:28:04,7
"Gorsuch was confirmed before Kavanaugh or Barrett, and his answer was at the very least honest;  >*Senator, again, I would tell you that Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It has been reaffirmed. The reliance interest considerations are important there, and all of the other factors that go into analyzing precedent have to be considered. It is a precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court. It was reaffirmed in Casey in 1992 and in several other cases. So a good judge will consider it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court worthy as treatment of precedent like any other.*   *...*   *It is, senator. If I were to start telling you which are my favorite precedents or which are my least favorite precedents or if I view precedent in that fashion, I would be tipping my hand and suggesting to litigants that I have already made up my mind about their cases. That is not a fair judge. I did not want that kind of judge when I was a lawyer, and I do not want to be that kind of judge now. And I made a vow to myself I would not be. That is the fairness problem. And then the independence problem. If it looks like I am giving hints or previews or intimations about how I might rule, I think that is the beginning of the end of the independent judiciary, if judges have to make, effectively, campaign promises for confirmation. And respectfully, senator, I have not done that in this process, and I am not about to start.*  Per [What Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett Said About Roe at Confirmation Hearings - FactCheck.org](https://www.factcheck.org/2022/05/what-gorsuch-kavanaugh-and-barrett-said-about-roe-at-confirmation-hearings/). Considering how things ultimately went, I'd say Gorsuch was absolutely correct. Kavanaugh and Barrett blatantly lied in their answers (I think we all know they were lying when they gave them). On top which, both displayed none of the character dignity Gorsuch did in his hearings. They were both basically sycophantic in how they answered questions and were always clearly dishonestly saying whatever they thought would get them through confirmation. The way the court has been handled and managed both from within and without since Trump's first term has largely damaged the image of the court as a fair arbitrator of justice.  You won't get any disagreement from me on that.  I would disagree it's Gorsuch's fault. His appointment was kind of the last dying gasp of anything that could be called reasonable from American Conservatism, before it fully converted over the next 2 years into the Cult of Trump and offering nothing but prayers to Dear Leader. You can see this just in the appointments themselves where Gorsuch was targeted for his legal background in opposing expanded executive power, while just a little bit later Kavanaugh was picked explicitly because he'd toyed with the idea that a President could be a king.  While both conservative leaning judges, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are on opposite ends of what was ultimately Trump's chief consideration.",Lord0fHats,2025-04-29T11:37:10,3
To be fair the Supreme Court expressly has the power to overturn their own decisions. They do it all the time too. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-29T11:29:12,0
