Unless you're indigenous American your lineage came from somewhere else.  America is a nation of immigrants and always should be.,PopPalsUnited,2025-04-25T13:03:14,16

">The Trump administration and its allies appear increasingly willing to use authoritarian and antidemocratic tactics against American citizens along the way—to make deportations logistically easier, to punish and criminalize political dissent and resistance, to create scapegoats for future shortcomings, or some combination thereof.  >While the Trump administration is earnestly trying to remove as many immigrants from the country as it can, there is also a highly performative nature to its second-term strategy. It is not enough to cite year-to-year removal statistics from federal databases; the Trump administration wants to be *seen* arresting immigrants, jailing immigrants, and deporting immigrants.",thenewrepublic,2025-04-25T12:59:40,7
"> ""Why, of course, the people don't want war,"" Goering shrugged. ""Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece. Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.""   > ""There is one difference,"" I pointed out. ""In a democracy the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.""   > ""Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.""",BlackOrre,2025-04-25T16:00:38,5

"First they came for the Latinos...and they didn't stand up because they voted for this  Then they came for the muslims...and they didn't stand up because, yup, they voted for this too  Then they came for the republican women...who voted for this because they didn't think they were considered DEI  Then they came for the veterans...who voted for this because they didn't think they were considered DEI  Then they came for the students....and they didn't stand up because they were instrumental in convincing America that Trump was a better alternative  Then they came for the rural farmers...and they didn't stand up because they still support Trump  And then they came for the judges...and that's the last line of defense, but everyone's already been deported, soooo",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-04-25T13:13:11,5
