"I never want to hear about ""fiscal conservatism"" from Republicans ever again after watching how strongly they're going along with this idea. They can find $90M to drop on military parades, but they can't feed the poor, they can't do reparations, they can't expand health care, etc.",jml510,2025-05-08T21:33:44,50

A military parade for a piece of shit cowardly draft dodger! Every veteran and active military member should be disgusted by this!,JediMasterPopCulture,2025-05-09T05:28:35,11
"During the parade, the soldiers should limp and claim it‚Äôs due to a massive outbreak of bone spurs.",Monster-eats-Florida,2025-05-09T01:49:48,9
"If Trump wants a parade, let his broligarch buddies pay for it.   Apartheid Elon gave Dementia Donny about a quarter of a billion dollars during the campaign last year. What's another $90 million?",clamorous_owle,2025-05-09T04:22:01,5

"That right there is why Democrats lost. Feed the poor, check. House the homeless, check. Reparations for shit my ancestors may or may not have taken part in? No. I didn't hold slaves, my family fought on the side of the North. I feel no obligation.",Puzzleheaded_Law_558,2025-05-09T14:49:32,-6

"But you‚Äôll gladly let Donald use your tax dollars for a military parade even though he dodged the draft with fake bone spurs , basically spitting on the honor of your ‚Äúfamily who served for the north‚Äù right?",DeadEnd9719,2025-05-09T17:36:30,1
"That's funny because barely any Democrats ever talk about reparations, anyway (much to the chagrin of Black activists), yet you said reparations is the reason why they lost. Black slaves and their descendants helped build this country and suffered for years, and still have yet to be paid back for it while other demographic groups receive their financial due from the government for past injustices. OTOH, people don't have much of a problem with billionaires continuing to dodge taxes at the expense of the poor.",jml510,2025-05-09T21:01:41,1
