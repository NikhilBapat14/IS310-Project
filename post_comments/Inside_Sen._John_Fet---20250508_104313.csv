">“It’s pretty impossible to overstate how disengaged he is,” a recently departed staffer said. “He doesn’t read memos, he’s taking very few meetings … the job is just a platform for him to run for president, that’s all he cares about.”",ThistleroseTea,2025-05-08T10:46:31,24
Dude needs to announce that he is not running for reelection so Pennsylvania Democrats can start working on his replacement.,code_archeologist,2025-05-08T10:49:29,15
"It's time, Pennsylvania. He needs to be removed for the sake of the PA and the US.",livelaughoral,2025-05-08T10:53:04,7
He needs to resign and get some help.   His position is way too important.,Adventurous-Bird-750,2025-05-08T15:23:13,3

It's sad and depressing to see what a stroke can do to someone who held so much promise.,YoungestDonkey,2025-05-08T10:58:54,6

Remember when reddit thought he and Sinema were the future because he wore sweatshirts and she’s Bi?,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-08T12:54:39,-9
President?! That stroke cooked this guy's brain.,pigeonholepundit,2025-05-08T11:07:19,40
I don't think it's *that* simple. He's clearly suffering personality changes caused by brain damage from his stroke. It happens all the time.,Logical_Hare,2025-05-08T11:31:35,5

They should just primary him out anyway. Democrats should just step up sometimes if you see your colleague not there just step in and do something no need to wait for the guy to be ok with it.,noforgayjesus,2025-05-08T10:52:15,20
"The thing is, Congresspeople can only go by expulsion or their own hand.  There’s no mechanism to recall them from Congress the way there is to recall state and local elected officials.  Democratic leaders and organizers can make all the noise they want to about him leaving office, but only John Fetterman can remove John Fetterman from the Senate.",ScotTheDuck,2025-05-08T10:58:37,1

You won’t find any self reflection here though…and Kristen Sinema has entered the chat,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-08T12:55:24,-5
I don't think he'd win mayor of Braddock at this point,FBS351,2025-05-08T11:44:16,13
And where exactly are we right now that’s not much better? Dementia Don isn’t earning golden stars here.,jacantu,2025-05-08T14:29:26,2
"Agreed, he needs to go and take care of his mental health.",NotAKentishMan,2025-05-08T11:22:58,3
Hi! Pennsylvania Democrat here! He was elected in 2022 and won't be up for election again until 2028. Our attention is focused elsewhere until then. Believe me when I say the people who worked hard to elect him are the ones hurt the most by his betrayal.,Capnzebra1,2025-05-08T13:49:56,6
I don't see him winning a primary again after all this. He's alienated his own voters already. And PA is a closed primary state. There's little chance Republicans would sacrifice their own primary and register as Democrats just to help him win.,ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-08T13:16:16,2
"Why would they? Establishment democrats very nearly ran an obvious dementia patient for president, and clearly would have if Biden hadn’t shit his fucking pants on national tv.   Matt Yglesias spent the entire last weekend tweeting “yeah this looks bad but he’s still the future of the party”   This guy is exactly what the DNC wants and votes for!",West_Flounder2840,2025-05-08T19:41:04,0
"He appeared to, from what I could see in the interviews he held when he was still Lieutenant Governor. I'm not from Pennsylvania so I surely missed a lot. But I liked his no-bullshit approach. He would actually answer the questions that were asked with a clear ""of course"" attitude: you could tell he actually believed what he was saying and knew what was being discussed, unlike so many others whose main skill is to craft politically safe responses. *That* John Fetterman was what Congress could use. This one, not so much.",YoungestDonkey,2025-05-08T12:23:55,4

I see. I only started paying attention in the last 2 years so had only seen an unflattering part of the picture. That is a shame he lost his cognitive ability to govern due to stroke,Deep-Ad9239,2025-05-08T12:26:47,3
