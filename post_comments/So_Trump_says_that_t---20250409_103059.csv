"47 days, final offer. 80 days less weekends and weekday golf outings   Source ChatGPT : As of April 9, 2025, during President Donald Trump‚Äôs second term, he has been in office for 80 days, since his inauguration on January 20, 2025. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of his time in office, excluding weekends and golf outings: 	1.	Total Days in Office: 80 days (January 20 to April 9, 2025). 	2.	Weekends: 	‚Ä¢	From January 20 to April 9, there have been 23 weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays). 	3.	Golf Outings: 	‚Ä¢	President Trump has visited his golf resorts on 9 out of 10 weekends since his second term began.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	He has spent nearly every weekend at his golf resorts, particularly his West Palm Beach course near Mar-a-Lago.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	On one-third of the first 31 days of his second term, President Trump played golf.  Ôøº  Calculation: 	‚Ä¢	Weekdays in Office: 80 total days minus 23 weekend days equals 57 weekdays. 	‚Ä¢	Weekday Golf Outings: While specific data on weekday golf outings is limited, reports indicate that President Trump has played golf on approximately one-third of the first 31 days of his second term, suggesting around 10 weekday golf outings during that period.  Ôøº 	‚Ä¢	Weekdays Minus Weekday Golf Outings: 57 weekdays minus approximately 10 weekday golf outings equals 47 weekdays without golf.  Summary:  Excluding weekends and estimated weekday golf outings, President Trump has had approximately 47 weekdays without golf during the first 80 days of his second term.  Note: This estimation is based on available reports and may not account for all golf outings. For a precise count, detailed records specifying the exact days of golf outings would be necessary.
