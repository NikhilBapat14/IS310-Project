">Hellerstein, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said that the Trump administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion or predatory incursion. Because of that, the Alien Enemies Act ""was not validly invoked by the presidential proclamation,"" he wrote.  >The judge said noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Even this Supreme Court should see the logic in this argument.  It is massive overreach by the executive branch.  There is no war, there is no emergency, there is no justification.  There are laws that allow for deportation that they are free to use.  But that requires the use of due process that Trump and his lackeys oppose.",I405CA,2025-05-06T13:09:14,21
"Both a Clinton‑appointed judge and a Trump‑appointed judge have now struck down the same Alien Enemies Act proclamation, an unusual bipartisan judicial rebuke that underscores how far the order stretched beyond traditional wartime use of the 226‑year‑old law.",TLakes,2025-05-06T13:12:06,14

"it was a hail mary effort to begin with: ignore settled law, and try to revive a war-time emergency act  from 1798 ???  The Felon-in-Chief is a loser, but a MAJOR loser in court.",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-06T13:47:29,32
"Genuine question because he's been ignoring a scotus order, do we have any mechanism (within the reddit TOS) that can make that happen?      I know legal scholars have put out the US Marshals and the possibility of deputizing citizens but it seems like judges are terrified of taking extreme measures forcing confrontations to enforce their orders.",notmyworkaccount5,2025-05-06T13:44:04,7
