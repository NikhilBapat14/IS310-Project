They all are. They're trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US while simultaneously killing regulations. This means that a lot of the products they're expecting to be manufactured here will be unexportable because most other countries still have those regulations. A good example is Energy Star compliance.,JoeWhy2,2025-05-08T07:48:11,8
