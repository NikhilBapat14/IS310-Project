"Yes Trump's rhetoric was certainly a blow to the conservatives but arguably a bigger factor was how the conservatives responded. Poilievre didn't immediately renounce Trump's threats and take a tough stance and instead he waited to see how it would play out. If Poilievre had been able to market himself as a conservative leader willing to stand up to Trump he may have been able to eek out a close victory. Similarly he focused so much of his attacks on Trudeau rather than building a strong case for the conservatives in general so when Trudeau stepped down he didn't have as much to run on.   Trump was a factor in this election no doubt but I think it would be wrong to write the entire story of the election as ""liberals win thanks to Trump.""",socialistrob,2025-04-29T01:03:42,53
"Another person already replied, but this is important to note. Poilievre was never beating Carney. He was soundly beating Trudeau who had become massively unpopular. This and internal politics led to the resignation of Trudeau. Trump came along and started his bullshit at pretty much the same time. Trudeau seized the opportunity to finish his term with dignity, and he did it brilliantly. The polls started to turn right then. And as soon as Carney became the Liberal leader, there never was a poll where PP was beating Carney. The tide had completely turned. This was made worse by PP hiding and having almost zero reaction to the Trump nonsense. For a few weeks, the Conservative campaign simply went missing, because their whole platform against Trudeau had crumbled, and they had to reformulate their whole approach to Trump, because their base is ultimately quite sympathetic to that kind of nonsense.  So yes, Trump played a big role. We will never know whether Carney, without Trump, could have beaten PP. I suppose the answer would have remained uncertain until election night. PP is just not very likeable, and the anger was specifically targeted at Trudeau.",Puzzleheaded-Dingo39,2025-04-29T00:30:54,257
"A few things happened:  Trudeau stepped down  Carney stole some of Poilievre's momentum and reversed some of the impact of the Liberals' decline under Trudeau by moving to the center  Trump went nuts, creating a rally around the flag effect  It became difficult to Poilievre to run as a Trump-style populist while asserting that he would stand up to Trump.  (No opportunity to pivot.)  When the final tallies are in, we will probably see some NDP and Bloc seats go to Liberals as part of this anti-Trump wave.  Americans regard Canada as some sort of cute little cousin.  But there is a lot of underlying low-grade anti-American sentiment in Canada.  Trump turned that slow burn into a raging fire.  Anyone who is familiar with Canada could have predicted that Trump's rhetoric would provoke a strong backlash and not just be seen as a bit unpleasant.  It seems that Trump has turned owning the libs into being owned by the Liberal Party north of the border.  Carney is not going to relent and knows more than enough about economics to lead an effective trade war.",I405CA,2025-04-29T03:38:20,42
"Unlike America,  conservatives have a very narrow path to power in Canada. Canadian elections are always a four  way spit. As a conservative in order to win seats  you  need one smaller parties to snatch some votes from your main opponent, the liberals. but in this election, Trump had the effect of scaring enough progressive voters to consolidate around the liberals.  Also, There were few weeks when the liberals were in the process of electing a new leader and Trump was raging about Canada all the time, right in that moment, The conservative campaign went completely offline. the election was there for them to take and they dropped the ball instead.

"Yes, 100%. Trump's blabber mouth about Canada as the 51st state galvanized Canadians like nothing short of a war, and because this was a lame-ass economic argument from our idiot-in-chief an articulate and Carney, who brings an established record in business that Trump couldn't begin to hold a candle to, showed up as the articulate grown up in the room, without having to resort to the in-the-mud politics that define the American system. Otherwise, simmering discontent with the Canadian liberals who've been in office for years would have easily delivered the election to Poilievre. Politics, like life, and half about timing.

"Without Trump starting a trade war and threatening to annex us, we'd be looking at a Conservative government right now.    Trudeau resigning and Carney immediately eliminating the carbon tax definitely played a role in it as well, as 6 months ago the Conservative platform was basically ""axe the tax"" and ""fuck Trudeau"".  The Liberals took both of those away and that took away a lot of the Conservative momentum.  Add to that Polievre's history of cozying up to right wing and MAGA and they became toxic to anyone who hadn't drunk the Conservative kool-aid.  It pretty much galvanized all the non-conservatives to rally behind Carney, the adult in the room who seems to be best equipped to deal with Trump.  Looking at the total votes though, the Conservatives didn't lose support, rather all the other parties voted Anything But Conservative, and the NDP and Bloc were sacrificed at the altar.",halpinator,2025-04-29T10:13:06,8

"Canadian here. Yes. The tariffs had a major effect on how the election turned out. The effect started just before Trudeau resigned but the resignation seemed to give it a boost.  For those of you who don’t know, the winner,  (Carney), ran the Bank of Canada and the Bank of, England (government central banks like the fed). It gave him some claim to being able to handle the economy and negotiate our way through the tariff mess.   He has a minority government and it might not last for the full term. In Canada the House of Commons can have a vote of non confidence where the whole House votes to boot the government and trigger an election.

"Yes, Trump had a direct impact on the Canadian election. But Pierre Poilievre's missteps on the campaign were just as big a factor as Trump himself.    Trump has sparked a wave of Canadian patriotism. But that doesn't benefit one party over another. PP didn't seem willing to pivot away from a campaign promising to end ""wholeness"" and talking about how the governing Liberals destroyed Canada with immigration and crime. This strategy is very similar to the American Republican Party playbook. And then, the Conservatives had a slogan of ""Canada First"", which is very reminiscent of Trump's America First slogan. This really associated the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) with the American MAGA movement, to their detriment.   Pierre Poilievre also had a policy of avoiding the news media. Only 4 questions were allowed at any event, and the questions were pre-screened. If PP could not face the scrutiny of the media, how could Canadians be confident he could stand up to American threats?",Shr3kk_Wpg,2025-04-29T12:04:32,5
"Trump’s threats had everything to do with Carney’s win.  Trump has threatened to economically crush Canada and it has completely galvanized the Canadian population.  With this galvanizing effect; the entire progressive electorate abandoned its old pattern of vote splitting and collectively rallied behind Carney as he is very unthreatening and his focus on economic issues became paramount.  For the progressive vote in Canada to coalesce around Carney, this was all about fear and uniting for a common purpose.  Trump was effectively on the ballot for millions of Canadians and it’s a fairly historic change in Canada to almost a 2 party political landscape.",Baulderdash77,2025-04-29T06:08:02,6

Trump's rhetoric about a 51st state are delusional sideshow distraction, they'll never actually amount to any substantive material actions really.

"No. Poilievre was never expected to beat Carney. The Liberals were pretty much guaranteed to win the moment Carney became PM  A lot of Canadians were not frustrated with the Liberal Party specifically but with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government.

I think you're giving Trudeau slightly more credit than he deserves. He was extremely unpopular for a long time.

"I think it’s a combo of three factors.  First, the simple one.  The longer you are the leader of a nation the less popular you get. Things go wrong along the way invariably and the buck always stops with the leader.  Anyone unhappy with their lot in life wants to blame someone and statistically there is always a huge chunk of voters who just want to “change it up” even if it doesn’t really make sense for them.  So after 10 years there was a lot of baggage with him.    The second I think is honestly a holdover from Covid.  A huge swath of the country reeeeeally hated being told what to do or not do with respect to masks, vaccines and seeing people in person.  And for them (by the work of the conservatives) Trudeau became the face of restrictions and rules and the conservatives parlayed that into a degree of anger not usually seen in Canadian politics and all of it gunning at Trudeau.  He was so visible during the pandemic it was easy to associate him with it.    The last one is perhaps derivative of Covid as well but is specifically the cost of living crisis. Looking at global trends it’s been going hard and growing basically everywhere around the world for ages putting the idea of a house and a nice life out of reach for many people.  But Covid ramped that up and the supply chain issues provided a lovely smokescreen for many corporations to price gouge.  I say all of this because this is a pretty global issue across many nations with left and right governments.   However in Canada once again the cons did a great job of gluing Trudeau to the crisis of costs.  The liberals and Trudeau are not without blame in this respect.  But given that the problem is so global it’s not likely to be all a result of liberal overspending as the cons often pitch.  Still. People are struggling to afford to live and Trudeau was at the helm as that got way worse whether or not he had much control over it.    That’s the three main reasons as I see it.  I’ll add a bonus one that present conservative politics likes to be tough and often a little mean in attitude. It’s in the brand.  Masculine. Pretty insult heavy.  And Trudeau is very much a fancy seeming dude and is easy for a lot of people to hate if they like that kind of macho insult heavy attitude.",BlueGreenRed_678,2025-04-29T03:37:49,6

"I think ""anti-US"" is the wrong framing. IME, the vast majority of Canadians think of the USA as friends. But friends who can be annoying, even when they don't mean to be. Like with any friends, the annoyances are usually low-grade, but they colour the relationship over time.   Canadians sometimes think that Americans see us as their sidekicks, which is rooted in a real power dynamic. Economic disputes can inflame the power dynamic issues. Softwood lumber disputes are good examples: when WTO rules against Canada we have to follow the rulings, but when WTO rules against the USA, Americans say ""well we don't agree with the WTO"" then act like their own courts can decide to pay less instead. Americans are friends, but filthy rich friends who'll act like they're better than us when it suits them. They also tend to tell us what we want, rather than ask. Annoying, but hey, friends can be annoying sometimes.  Enter Donald Trump's ""51st state"" nonsense. It's hard to imagine a message that would more inflame underlying Canadian annoyances about the USA. Now the US isn't just *acting* like they can boss us around; they're literally saying that they should own us and control us. Trump goes far further than that, and actually threatens to inflict economic harm. To return to the metaphor, it's as if the filthy rich friend suddenly threatened to hit us with vexatious lawsuits until we lose so much money that they can buy our house out from under us. We might not think they'll go that far, but they've already started, and every day they threaten more.

It's not uncommon to hear complaints about Americans knowing nothing about Canada in spite of its proximity and for Canadians to claim that they have more in common with Aussies or Europeans than they do with Americans.  This can be seen in the Canadian view of the War of 1812, a war that Americans today tend to see as a stalemate and the UK has long forgotten.  Canadians really like to think that they burned down the White House.  But the White House was torched by British troops and Canada was not yet a country.

As for the threats of annexation, Trump is a mental case holding a sabre. He has only increased the annexation rhetoric (not just on Canada, but on Greenland as well). So Poilievre running a populist campaign trying to be “Canada’s Trump”, adding in Trump’s support, scuttled any hope the Conservatives had.  Was it a “win by distraction” campaign - certainly. But all Poilievre had to do was distance himself from Trump, but he knew doing so would cost him a big chunk of his base.  Thanks Trump!

The Liberals managed to brand Poilievre as a Trump supporter in the nations eyes, and because Trump is almost universally hated in Canada outside of very socially conservative circles, it cratered his chances on a national level. It also certainly helped that Carney is a legitimately good candidate with good credentials. People are concerned about the economy and having someone with so much economic experience running the country will hopefully help.   Carney does *say* that his policies will be different from Trudeau, but we will need to see if that's the case or not. It could very well be essentially the same government with a different name on the box.  Polling stats from CBC suggested that young voters leaned (more) Conservative while older voters leaned (more) Liberal (which is highly unusual and I want to dig into the stats myself when they are more available), citing housing as the reason. Younger people seem to have viewed the Conservatives housing policies as better/more likely to be successful at reducing housing prices, which is a key issue for the 25-35 age bracket. If Carney is unable to deliver, it may shake up the next election significantly.

If 4% of voters had cast their votes for the CPC instead of the LPC we'd be looking at a very different map.   For example, consider Mississauga East-Cooksville. It ended up 50.1% to 44.7%.

"This is not rare in Canada when the party leader doesn’t have a seat or loses a seat.

In Canada senate appointments are until age 75, so once you are in, the job is 100% secure.  It seems like party discipline in Canada is way more binding than in the US. One of the reasons why might be that you can’t run as a member of a party if the party doesn’t sign your nomination papers. It keeps the nuts out. Another reason is that if the party “suggests” that you step down and you refuse you don’t get any committee assignments or cabinet positions (the cabinet in Canada is chosen from the pool of elected MPs by the Prime Minister) and you languish in the back benches. The party remembers that you are not a team player, so they may not sign your nomination papers at the next election. If it is a safe seat the party will win it anyway.

Ultimately, if someone thinks that there's too much social services spending, there are legitimate reasons/perspectives to support that, it's not objectively wrong, it's a subjective opinion.

The housing they build will not only be more expensive, but also likely subsidized, meaning that people who own those houses will not be paying market rate on top of the inflated price.

Tax dollars of people who live in Winnipeg should not be subsidizing people to own houses in Vancouver.",Baerog,2025-04-29T23:28:51,2

"Why would private developers want decreased prices?  What's the incentive?  They are in the business of profiting, not breaking even.      If the government steps in as developer, they don't have to be concerned with profit, they just have to break even and they technically don't even have to do that.",troubleondemand,2025-04-29T15:17:11,2
"> Why would private developers want decreased prices? What's the incentive? They are in the business of profiting  EDIT: Slight correction: you are asking the wrong question. The question is what's the developer's incentive to build houses.  You just answered your own question, the incentive is profit. The developers profiting and home prices going down are not diametrically opposed things. Profit is the difference between cost and sale price, not the difference between last year's sale price and this year's sale price.  > If the government steps in as developer, they don't have to be concerned with profit, they just have to break even and they technically **don't even have to do that.**  I think this is a really bad mindset. The government money is *your* money.",pgriss,2025-04-29T15:52:30,1
"> The government money is your money.  Yes it is.  I am all for it being spent on things the people who pay that money need.  Are developers and contractors going out of business?  Do they need subsidies to survive?      Are private developers/contractors going to sell at cost?  If not, then there is a markup involved which will make the sales price higher than it needs to be.",troubleondemand,2025-04-29T17:18:51,2
"> Do they need subsidies to survive?  We are not talking about their survival. There is a shortage of housing, I think we agree on that. All I am saying the government incentivizing profit driven private companies to fix this shortage seems like a pretty good idea to me. It's certainly not an obviously worse idea than the government itself building housing.  > then there is a markup involved which will make the sales price higher than it needs to be  If you want profit to be removed from home development, that is certainly a choice. I grew up in Eastern Europe, where we had this choice going for 45 years. It wasn't pretty. Admittedly the current real estate market in Canada is not pretty either, so I understand if people are desperate to try anything.  ""Luckily"" the people who promised your preferred solution are now in power. I hope it works out for you! :)",pgriss,2025-04-29T17:57:42,0

I'm from Eastern Europe myself, and the late-era Soviet Commieblocks are perfectly fine. Cozy, comfy, rather easy to upgrade (for example, modern windows for heat retention), cheap-ish (ofc, price of real estate will always rise if new developments don't happen).

If this is not sarcasm, then you either know very little of how the rest of the world lives, or you are a complete idiot.  First of all the updates you are talking about have been made possible because the former political system collapsed. Secondly, I have relatives who live in those ""comfy, updated, perfectly fine"" commie blocks. It would be a huge downgrade compared to how the average American lives, and certainly not what the young generations of Canadians and Americans are yearning for when they complain about lack of home ownership.",pgriss,2025-05-01T17:12:38,1
">It would be a huge downgrade compared to how the average American lives  That's what I lack - knowledge on Western domicile living conditions.  American cardboard walls and large-ish gardens (which just become depositories for trash) don't seem very appealing to me. Combine that with weird appliance choices, like steam kettles for boiling water, and also the universal bitching about HoA and such, and they seem really... backwards in some cases to me sometimes. :/",Mousazz,2025-05-01T20:05:01,1
