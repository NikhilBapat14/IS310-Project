"I’m tired of all the political/business/IR pundits who are constantly trying to explain the rationale behind every erratic move he makes—as if they could puzzle out some grand strategy from it all. Folks, these are not the words, actions, or demeanor of a generally sane person. I wish more reputable media outlets would invite credentialed psychologists to give their assessments of him and the (I’m sure) multitude of personality disorders he probably has. I bet that would result in far greater insight into his behavior, and then the world can plan accordingly. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-29T05:27:08,44
"The author of this article doesn’t understand how narcissists operate, and has zero credibility because they clearly have no understanding of how Trump behaves.   The Trump response will be a combination of the election was obviously rigged and that’s why Trump needs to annex Canada to save them from themselves, and the self aggrandizing idea that if Canadian conservatives had been nicer to Trump then they obviously would’ve won.",bestforward121,2025-04-29T06:04:39,23

"The sad thing is Trump won't see this as a repudiation of his abhorrent and asinine behavior towards Canada.  Trump will almost certainly see this as Carney now owes him, because Trump got him elected.  This feeds into Trump's ego, in a weird twisted way.",thepartypantser,2025-04-29T05:34:33,12
"No he doesn't.   People need to get off this narrative of Trump as a mastermind. He is clearly clueless, most of the time shoots himself in the foot, and is at the mercy of his handlers.

Trump couldn't find Canada on a map.,Fipskaeg,2025-04-29T11:45:40,2
"It's clear the great plan is to unite the world against fascism. To show, through experiential learning, what can happen if a population, even one as great as the US, succumbs to the evils of hate and greed. When their economy becomes so dystopic and one sided, that media empires can rise to levels that can create a great psychosis to make its own people vote against every common interest they once held dear.  The plan to dangle a few coins in the faces of ""Christians"" as a bribe to betray the ideals of their country. To show the world that this simple bribe can be effective in making its people betray not only their ideals, but their neighbors, friends, allies, and even family.  Or the plan to create hate groups where these same righteous idealogues can be manipulated to cast out their neighbors under the guise of economics. Just a constant stream of hate and intolerance, all while preaching love and tolerance. The ultimate hypocrites.  And now we all see clearly these trappings thanks to trump who has led us to this impossibly dark place in order to show us how wrong it was to follow him and his evil co conspirators into this dark place.  That the world order, while imperfect, was the path to peace and prosperity for all and that we all need to stand together to reject the hate and dishonor of trumpism.  Thank you donald trump for this grand visionary plan",PayTheTeller,2025-04-29T05:59:17,2

"Try reading. During COVID, Canadian truck drivers protested COVID measures like face masks. They caused massive food shortages in Canada. Recently, Trump signed an executive order that all truck drivers should be required to speak English. And so now he wants foment anger amongst the people that are best positioned to retaliate against the government. Most likely, this won’t end well for the truck drivers because the only barriers to entry are experience. If the government decided to fund vocational training for drivers, they would instantly diminish whatever power these truck drivers have",JollyToby0220,2025-04-29T04:52:50,-3

Thank you. Giving Trumpsky credit for forethought is getting old. He react in the moment and if what he says gets a reaction he continues.    Many media outlets have stopped naming those who commit major crimes so they don't become ghoulish folk heroes and inspire copycats. I challenge the media (who have shown little intestinal fortitude to this point) to stop using his name. They should refer to him in multiple variations of President of the USA so it effects the trending media reports. It would drive him nuts!,Winterwasp_67,2025-04-29T08:27:49,2

I wonder if it’s a matter of framing or inferences, like assume we do have a president who has xyz, what does that look like and how would you interpret such actions through that lens.

"Accounts from people who’ve met him have always remarked that his real life persona is a lot saner than his public one, but I wonder if that’s because he’s simply too cowardly to let his real self fly in a private setting. He needs to be admired and loved up close. When blasting on truth social, well that’s kinda when his true ego gets to scream into the void.  Whatever the case, his chosen public persona is that of a hopeless idiot, yet relentless bully. Why is the onus on the public to try to determine whether there’s more depth or cunning there? Why does his administration chastise the public for not parsing out the hidden meaning behind his deranged words? It’s grifters all the way down. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-29T08:56:53,2
