"‚ÄúUnder the previous administration, this office, which cost taxpayers more than $50 million per year, spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving,‚Äù    - Rubio asserted     It boggles my mind how wide and deep lefty corruption goes.  They‚Äôve weaponized everything against the right. From the FBI to NGO‚Äôs to the Courts to Academia to the IRS, and more and more and more.   Remove the MSMs extreme bias, and remove all the horribly flawed corruption the left has created, and the right couldn‚Äôt lose an election if they tried.",cliffotn,2025-04-17T13:40:23,5
"Good. End censorship. If the left gets to have a voice, so does the right. No one has the right to silence conservative voices but fully allow leftist voices even if they threaten murder and death.",ITrCool,2025-04-17T07:59:39,6
