"I live in Charlottesville, [there is a literal video of them waiting outside of the court room in a mask and no identification](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/s/p3mFZeB34E). Well meaning people did try to stop it, but what else can you do?  These 'officials' presented their badges/DHS paperwork to the baliff when entering the building, which according to r/law is actually what normally happens, and LEOs aren't expected to show documentation to anyone who asks for it in a court house too, which is ridiculous.  Our local subreddit had a post when they originally showed up at court to warn everyone, as well as links for 3rd party sites that track ICE locations, the video of the altercation, and now here we are. It's odd watching atrocities happen in real time within literal blocks of my location and not being able to do anything about it  We protest, Cville had thousands out on the last nationwide protests, and there going to be even more for mayday.

Many ICE Agents are currently choosing wearing masks during arrests (just as many narcotics officers do)  as there are groups out there doxxing them individually and their families as well.   Some also are undercovers.    None of this is all that uncommon for any law enforcement agency.   Marked vehicles are not required either.   A warrant-in-hand is not required so long as the Agent has probable cause and the warrant generally issued within 24 hours of arrest.

You work and train while living in an isolated bubble away from the rest of America's citizens. You're actively warned to be apolitical. Our military is built and run to defend against military threats, details of the oath aside. Law enforcement agencies are the ones that are given the authority and resources to handle the internal issues.  Most people in the military are just like you, outraged but powerless, or apathetic and trying to survive each day until they can be done with their contract. You definitely can't expect a bunch of soldiers to go rogue, steal rifles from an armory, and then go rounding up ICE agents.  I hate this fascist regime. What we're dealing with is obscene and something has to be done, but saying that the entire DoD has failed this country is a bit far.

"The people who were provided  no due process were indeed kidnapped and human trafficked. If no judge was ever a part of the process, you were just kidnapped. You have to offer due process. That's not to say what's happening in this instance, but the fact that 200 some people did have it happen to them means every arrest should be suspected as a kidnapping because the administration is unrepentant about not providing due process, and Trump keeps intimating he will use El Salvador and now Rwanda? On further and further groups in an effort to intimidate and consolidate power.  That doesn't even touch on the fact that arrests of foreign students for the content of their speech has seen NO CHARGES. There are these students who are just sitting in detention, not pending trial, just detained, indefinitely. That cannot be the status quo. Every arrest must be suspect when the people in power are so unrepentant and are engaged in ongoing violations of due process.",amootmarmot,2025-04-25T11:17:03,3

"As a general matter that's correct.   For example. Imagine you have an arrest warrant out.  Then you get stopped by the police in an otherwise routine traffic stop. You hand over your driver's license and they run you in the system and it turns put you have a warrant out.   That officer is going to come back to your car, inform you that you have a warrant out and that you are going to be placed under arrest.  That is, more or less all he has to tell you at that point.   But keep in mind that would be a Judicial warrant and not an ice administrative warrant. There are some subtle distinctions there.   The issue of undercover officers arresting people is complicated. Some states have case law on the issue, some states don't the last time I looked into it. It's not patently illegal for a plain clothes officer to make an arrest.   However, most obstruction of justice statutes and resisting arrest statutes require some type of intentional or at least knowing conduct.   Not knowing that the people involved were officers is a trial defense that your attorney would assert.   I will say that even if someone who has been a prosecutor in the past, most lawyers, whether it be prosecutors or defense lawyers alike look dimly on plain clothes officers making arrests.      I live and work out in the country. It is not at all uncommon for Jimmy to sheriff's deputy to respond to a call for backup while wearing civilian clothes. He might be the only other officer within 10 miles. But Jimmy is almost always going to throw on at least his vest that has his badge and equipment on it before he does anything.    But a dude wearing cowboy boots jeans a T-shirt and a vest that says sheriff's deputy with a name is markedly more identifiable as a police officer than someone wearing no ID at all.",BigBennP,2025-04-25T08:36:18,24

"Realistically, they never will. That's not what the military is designed to do. As a system, it's fiercely apolitical. So long as it's internal agencies that are being commanded to do these things, the military won't interfere. If the military ordered to start throwing people into gulags, then that's when you'll start seeing the disobedience. That's when you'll see people refusing to follow what they consider to be an unlawful order. The United States military will not be a force that starts a coup against the government, which is essentially what you're asking.  I'm not defending the organization, I'm just providing context for why waiting for the military to swoop in and set things right won't work.

Otherwise you could end up snatching people who are here legally (which has already happened).  I and most people on the left don't have a problem with deporting people who are here illegally. The problems are that (1) no due process is being given (2) people are being sent to countries they didn't originate from (3) people with no history of violence are being sent to a supermax gang prison in El Salvador based on false claims that they have links to a gang.
