"Worst part of it is that once stores start raising prices, they will never lower them again even if the tariffs go away.",ClaroStar,2025-05-06T07:07:14,12
"Tarriff will make us rich again!!! It's what Trump told me!!! Right? Empty shelves will make us save money too!!! And the  dolls, who need 25? MAGA!",NorthenFreeman,2025-05-06T07:01:09,6
"Thank you President Dump for acting in your best interests and thank you MAGA for voting against yours. When the dust settles, I hope you see clearly what you brought.",NoReserve7293,2025-05-06T07:03:28,3
Mattel has already said they are not bringing any manufacturing here to the US and will prices to compensate for the tariffs. This is one of many corporations. Why manufacture here when you can make more. Get ready for the price hurt American consumers,lostnthestars117,2025-05-06T12:10:36,2
We all know that get rich quick schemes only benefit the seller and hurts the buyers.   Why would it be different in politics?,NoAnimator544,2025-05-06T08:35:47,1
Downside: Higher prices are going to put a lot of people under some real financial strain.  Upside: The people that suffer will remember that MAGA caused this and vote accordingly when the 2026 midterm elections come around.,Troll_in_the_Knoll,2025-05-06T07:06:04,1
"That's perfect. I mean, I hate it, but it's perfect.",IvankaPegsDaddy,2025-05-06T06:57:49,3
Or we just stop shopping at the big cooperate stores like Wal Mart (who are attempting to move to less hiring anyway) and start shopping at non Maga businesses.  Support businesses that support America not this nazi regime.  Soon enough they will be inspecting their wallets and crying even more than they do now.  ,arilupe,2025-05-06T07:05:18,4

A continuation of what they've already been doing since the pandemic.,ipanoah,2025-05-06T09:25:38,3
They will not remember. Most won’t even admit it in the first place.,supertecmomike,2025-05-06T07:09:45,11
No they won't. They will blame Biden because they are sheep who only listen to trump and cronies. The average American voter is dumb as shit and has the memory of a goldfish,xicor,2025-05-06T07:10:40,3
Downside: Americans will believe anything and have a memory of a goldfish.,namastayhom33,2025-05-06T07:21:08,3
"Unless Fox news reports on it, they will never know.  And Fox news is still reporting on Bidens actions in the WH from 2021.  Anything to take the blame away from Trump and the GOP.",Save_The_Wicked,2025-05-06T09:03:30,1

"Most people don't have a choice out of corporate shopping (albersons/smiths, Walmart) and soon will have even less of a choice because the smaller shops around here prices are up already.",FlyingRock,2025-05-06T07:23:21,3
"""Stop shopping at the stores you only shop at because of what you can afford and start shopping at the stores that are already too expensive for you but that now became astronomically more so, only make sure you grill their owners about their politics first.""   Great plan, I'm sure a lot of people will take it into consideration.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-05-06T07:35:11,4
Local businesses are often MAGA and also import their goods.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-06T08:57:34,1
"Lol they can try, but I'll shop where I choose. ",arilupe,2025-05-06T07:24:32,2
Agreed.  Sadly most of America relies on cooperations and they know that.  ,arilupe,2025-05-06T07:25:42,1
"Like I said in response to the other comment.  I agree it's not easy for some and understandable that's where they have to shop.  Some smaller towns only have a wal mart and no other options, but for those that do have savings and other options I think it's a better option than doing nothing.  Some of us can afford a little pain to do something for everyone. I'm going to do what I can because I dont know what else to do besides protesting and waiting. ",arilupe,2025-05-06T07:41:48,4
Best is to try and shop second hand for anything you can get second hand.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-06T08:58:22,3
"That's true. I guess just wait and see if the bury their heads in the sand maga finally lift their heads up when the tariffs start really hitting the economy.  Fact is though no matter what we do it's going to hurt the middle class and down the most and I wish the top earners got to feel more of that.  I have always felt like all of this DEI bs that Trump pushed was used to distract Americans from the wealthy and their accountability to pay taxes like everyone else.  Not only for that purpose, but also reconfigure the system to work even more in their favor.  Sucks to think we just have to sit on our hands and take it all in. ",arilupe,2025-05-06T09:04:26,3

"Ah, the joys of sustaining capitalism!",bkelln,2025-05-07T06:43:39,1
"I'm not sure that a few rich people doing what they were probably doing already changes anything, but if it makes you feel better, go for it. Most people will continue shopping at whatever option is the cheapest.",CommunityOrnery6058,2025-05-06T07:53:19,0
Agreed but I dont see many alternatives. ,arilupe,2025-05-06T07:27:38,1
