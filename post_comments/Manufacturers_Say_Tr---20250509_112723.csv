"Too bad Americans are too expensive.  Due to how vicious the US is, workers expect a wage near the poverty line or above. The ultra capitalist path American companies and individuals take close off the possibility of people making a good living to continue to contribute to their country. Why did American companies ship everything out of the country in the first place? Profit. If you have a choice to pay the minimum wage in a state or pay that same minimum wage to worker for a month sometimes in other countries, what are you going to do?   Companies facing trump have to do one thing: survive 4 years. They aren’t going to invest billions into a country that is unstable. They are also not going to bring manufacturing back after Trump is done. That is just economics 101. Sure, some companies are ‘saying’ they are going to do this, but it would likely be on a small scale. Remember the TSCM fiasco that Trump lauded as a major win and when the project was built, employed a few people to make LCD screens? The USA funded the facility construction and gave tax breaks over it, and it came to nothing. We just see the same crap repeated over and over with Trump.",invincibleparm,2025-05-09T16:06:56,6

"Supply chain is one of the most fundamental parts of manufacturing.   For example, the reason that computer processors aren't made in America isn't just because cheap labor in Taiwan, it's also because America completely lacks the supply chain, super advanced equipment, and expertise required to make them.   You can't tariff your way into Americas producing chips without solving ALL of the other problems first.   Maybe if we had the fabs, the supply chain, the expertise, and the workforce then you could tariff (I guess?) to make US production competitive.

Ok, so that sounds like a good opportunity to manufacture the wetsuits in this country, avoid the tariffs and shipping.  You'd think that would more than compensate for increased wages and *in this specific case* there's not much capital investment to build out the facility and it's a rather low labor item to assemble.  Great, except a domestic manufacturer would still need to purchase the type of neoprene that's only available in Asia and pay tariffs on importing that.  The two current domestic manufacturers of wetsuits are going to get hit hard both with those tariffs and an inability to then export at all due to getting hit both with raw material tariffs and retaliation tariffs for their finished goods.

You hit it perfectly. What is the point of short term self inflicted pain if the gain brings us back to where we are now?  Companies were hitting record profits a year ago. Moving everything to America at a higher cost is going to.... Be even more profitable?  I don't see how any of the current administration's actions point to this being short term pain - or with an opportunity for long term gain.   It's worse now and it looks like it will be worse later. I already work for a company that produces the vast majority of their products sold in N. America in N. America but that's including Mexico. We can't move our production across the border overnight and even if we could it would be significantly more expensive. And when the economy is bad - people and companies spend less.   So it's....

"Ok, I'll bite...  Trump 1.0 didn't implement tariffs nearly to the extent that he is now, and they weren't implemented until later in his first administration.  They still did have a huge negative impact.  For just one example, China retaliated by implementing tariffs on soy beans.  This resulted in Trump giving farmers billions of dollars in bailouts (literal socialism) while China invested in suppliers both domestically and from other countries.  China as customers is not ever coming back to the level it once was let alone could've been.  The economy was already doing well before Trump took office with low unemployment, a low deficit, high GDP, etc...  It continued to grow in all aspects until 2018, which just so happens to coincide with when impacts from his tax changes and tariffs came into play.  Discounting the pandemic and just looking at 2018 to 2020 the deficit skyrocketed, GDP fell, and inflation was going up.  Unemployment was low, but the *new* jobs number was down.  Trump has the worst record in history of this country in terms of new jobs during his term.  But the pandemic didn't magically change anything... we had supply chain issues, disruption of purchasing patterns, etc..., but we also had tariffs that impacted pricing on top of this.  IB4: ""Buh Biden kept tariffs""  Yes, that's because tariffs can be implemented very quickly and while they can be withdrawn unilaterally just as quickly, it takes years to negotiate bilateral removal of tariffs... if at all because like the soy bean example, sometimes customers don't come back.

"I’m not saying that tariffs are the answer **but** if you do implement them, you need to have an industry to justify “defending” them with.   He is imagining or trying pretend that this is post WWII, that we have a huge industrial manufacturing sector just waiting to get back to work and have the same growth that happened in the 50s. Most of our manufacturing was offshored to cut costs and increase profits, This was facilitated by free trade policies as well as a globalized workforce and exploited labor in developing countries.   The skilled labor’s not here. The factories aren’t here. The companies and people that produce the materials to make the things the factories could produce aren’t here. He’s imposed tariffs on everything that it would take to build the facilities AND goods to be produced in this utopia that doesn’t exist.   In a world where we had the industrial capacity, workforce, and resources tariffs *could* be a way to raise the prices of competing goods so that domestic options would be more affordable. This doesn’t work though because domestic producers see the prices go up and raise their prices to match.

Most of the material is from Asia . After the exchange rate conversion, it cost me about $3200 USD.  If it had been manufactured in the companies American factory, it would’ve cost me about $3600 +10% sales tax.  So not only did I not have to pay tariffs, I got a nice discount on it by ordering from Canada.    This document does a good job of explaining the process with some case studies.    https://www.paint.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/11/ACA-Guidance-on-USMCA-Rules-of-Origin.pdf",CopeSe7en,2025-05-10T06:16:41,1

"You say ""end goal"" like there's a). an end.  and b). someone with a plan.    No one is planning an end state.  It's all just people with power and competing agendas.   When in history has humanity ever achieved an ""end state""?  Everything moves and flows into something else.    I don't like being pessimistic, but based on our current situation, unless things suddenly change, you're not likely to get the utopia you're hoping for.  It would be nice, but ""end states"" don't happen.",overcomebyfumes,2025-05-10T06:49:27,1

"For decades the code physically required to launch nukes was uniformly set to  all zeros, and was kept entered on all the missiles in advance, so that proper safety wouldn't 'slow a response down' if it was needed.

You can't honestly believe that can you? He can absolutely order a nuclear strike as commander in chief of the us armed forces and simply fire anyone who refuses to carry out the order.  Just like he has done in virtually every other area in our government.,sequoiachieftain,2025-05-09T13:04:40,2
"I mean you are completely right. But from a price perspective made in Ontario would cost $220 stateside and made in the US $225 in my example.  It gets way more complicated because of margins and sometimes the importer does not want raise prices and sometimes the importer will raise prices even more because a) they can and b) cost of repricing.   For example when Europe switched to the Euro technically prices should have been the same just the currency changed, but as all the restaurants had to print new menus, they rounded up to the next good looking number.",soonnow,2025-05-10T01:42:28,1
"I mean the argument for European steel industries (not on only in the UK) has been that they are strategic and we should not give those advantages away. I'm honestly not well informed enough to know if that is true.   Wanting a strategic industry is a fair point. But then politicians should come out and just subsidize or nationalize them. Instead of the round about way using tariffs. At least than it's clear what the cost is to the tax payer, instead of hidden costs to the consumer and the economy.",soonnow,2025-05-10T01:50:57,1

"You’ve got to think though. The rapid rise of AI across multiple companies and countries means extreme unpredictability that *he wasn’t accounting for* when he made the choices he made in regards to all the bullshit he slings.  His 80 year brain must reel when presented with scenarios that seem like they’re from a science fiction. I *don’t* think he’s a world-killer. And that’s what large-scale conflict practically all escalates to now. The military itself most likely understands this much better than anyone, because it will inevitably force AGI to start killing humans.  And that’s not how we wanna start AI. Not at all. Like bad vibes man.  Edited: it’s entirely likely that China has an AI lead over us.

"> extreme unpredictability  yeah i mean, i might not be the one who's got to think here. i think you ought to think about the kind of scenarios that would devolve into large-scale war, that ""extreme unpredictability"" makes them ALL more likely, then what tools the US military has and whether the potus will use them  let's also take some time to consider the impact of destroying the international order that's served to mitigate tensions and prevent large confrontations across the globe. whether you're talking trade, mutual defense, or international diplomatic bodies, trump has flipped the table over. none of his dramatic policy shifts have made the world more resilient or able to prevent conflict.  the more you look at it the harder it is to believe they aren't intentionally trying to start WW3 with the goal of global fascist domination and the post-USA oligarchy getting first dibs for their neofeudalist empires.",tsunake,2025-05-09T13:08:44,1
"It really doesn't matter where the company is, it really only matters where the production is for the tariffs. See Apple, a US company that is their own importer. The consumer pays the same price no matter if Apple is a US company or let's say a Chinese company. It's just in one case Apple has to pay tariffs for a container of iPhones and otherwise the importer would have to pay it. But for the consumer the price stays the same.  This is just always assuming everything else stays the same.",soonnow,2025-05-10T03:36:14,1
