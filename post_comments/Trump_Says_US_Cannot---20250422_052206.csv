"This is confusing to me. I think dems need to take a properly cautious approach to this.  Keep in mind that illegally crossing a border is a civil offense, not criminal. Additionally, the Supreme Court has ruled that deportation is not punishment, so it doesn‚Äôt count as depriving life nor liberty. Sending someone back to their home country or to another country who accepts them does not and should not require article iii courts ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù jury trial. Obviously they should still have some semblance of a hearing to ensure those who are legally here can defend themselves and be afforded those protections, but this is not a criminal conviction.  However, sending them to a prison changes things dramatically. Now, they absolutely DO need article iii courts to prove that they committed a crime, not just the civil offense of border crossing because the US is directly involved in depriving them of liberty.",GoodiesHQ,2025-04-22T12:21:40,3

We can't just circumvent the constraints of the law when it's inconvenient we need to manage the system in a more effective way. Deportation without due process is just human trafficking and if it can happen to one person that was an administrative error it will keep happening because they can tell be looking at you who the bad ones are (Trump's actual words),Shooting-Joestar,2025-04-22T12:24:16,2
"I thought he swore that he would uphold the Constitution. He can have an opinion, but he doesn‚Äôt write that rule.  He doesn‚Äôt want anything to be fair or anyone to have due process because it will reveal his bullshit",thomport,2025-04-22T12:24:19,2
"Legal experts correct me if I'm wrong, but not every deportation requires a trial.  If someone is actually undocumented / came in without going through the legal process, they can be deported back to their country of origin without a trial.  If someone overstayed a visa and is therefore here illegally, they can be deported to their country of origin without a trial.  My understanding is that the problem with what Trump is doing is the following:  1) deporting undocumented immigrants to be imprisoned on foreign soil (not necessarily their nation of origin, and with no evidence that they committed a crime in that nation). For imprisonment, we would require due process / a fair trial.  2) deporting people who are here legally *without* appropriate due process.  These require due process and a trial, because these actions are depriving people of their liberty without due process.  As far as I'm aware, this is the answer to the right-wing memes that are going around Facebook and elsewhere about how Obama, Clinton, W, etc., deported without trials. As far as I know they didn't deport people-- undocumented or otherwise-- to foreign prisons, and they didn't use deportation as punishment for people here legally who disagreed with their administration's policies.  And this business of imprisoning undocumented immigrants to another country-- to be imprisoned-- is akin to extradition, but they have to have been convicted of a crime in that country to be imprisoned there. Or they need to be tried for a crime committed in that nation.  So all this CECOT shit is wholly illegal for multiple reasons.  Please correct me if I have this wrong.",JoeBiden-2016,2025-04-22T12:26:19,2

"I think saying an honest day's work for an honest day's wages has always been a misnomer.   Usually when they say those things, they mean the kind of work that people only do when they must do it to survive.    We have a little Hobby farm. We have six mature blueberry bushes, and it's close to blueberry season where we live right now.  When it gets to harvest season I will have to spend about 30+ minutes two to three times a week picking the blueberries before they fall to the ground or the birds get them.  We invite people over to pick for themselves for free because we get more than we can use.    Those six bushes produce probably 20 to 30 gallons of blueberries across a season.   I saw an ad the other day. It was a blueberry farm in Northern Louisiana advertising that they needed blueberry pickers.  They were paying $11 an hour for 9 to 10 hour days across May and June.      In all honesty F that.  Agricultural workers are exempt from overtime under the flsa.    That it's 8 weeks of 10 hour days in the sun picking blueberries with your hands.  At the end of it, you don't have a job, you're not the farmer's problem anymore.  You will make a grand total of $4,400.  Even if you could find other jobs like that year-round, and you can't, , you would still live right at the poverty line. $27k a year.    No one who has better opportunities takes jobs like that.

"So many assumptions, without foundation.  I will absolutely call out individuals of any stripe for hypocrisy, but screaming into the reddit void about inconsistency means nothing. It‚Äôs futile as there is no ‚Äúhive mind.‚Äù There are literally pockets of everything here.  But Reddit itself cannot be hypocritical. It‚Äôs a fucking tool. The user‚Äôs individually may be, but blaming it in reddit in general is just an excuse to beat your own drum without actually dealing with the issue at hand.  ‚ÄúI mean Reddit‚Äôs hypocritical, not necessarily *you*,‚Äù is just BS, and I think you‚Äôll know that if you‚Äôll think about it. At best it just feeds that self-righteous feeling that makes you think that you‚Äôre better than that ‚Äúaverage Redditor,‚Äù which again, accomplishes nothing.  Yeah, it may have leaned more Libertarian, but ironically, US society has leaned away from that party even as that same society has embraced some of the foundational tenets of the party like decriminalizing weed, same-sex marriage and other things.

You say that liberals are the problem, but that link with the information about Obama **is on the ACLU‚Äôs site**. They are literally the banner carrier for most of not all liberal causes.

"The While I understand your point, pointing out hypocrisy should be encouraged even if it means those who point it out end up downvoted and viewed by few. The alternative is an increasingly zealous echo chamber. If it seems like a way for me to grandstand, that‚Äôs also what it‚Äôs combating. So it‚Äôs a bit of pretentious race to the bottom if we‚Äôre being cynical. I know I‚Äôm not changing anyone‚Äôs mind, and that‚Äôs not my intention, but all sides should have hypocrisy pointed out on the offchance they might take a moment to reflect on what‚Äôs important to them - contempt for the right vs. concern with the moral underpinning of what they‚Äôre doing. Tail wagging the dog, canary in the coal mine, pick your metaphor, because what‚Äôs happening in this sub the past decade is not healthy for those who doomscroll all day.  I know we‚Äôre talking past each other here so I will have to leave it at that.
