I feel like the current biggest problem with Democrats is that they seem to be six to eight months behind all these obvious issues facing them.,thenewNFC,2025-05-02T14:52:39,72
"The details in the New York Magazine story are chilling.   He's seriously on track to seriously hurt (or worse) himself, his wife or someone else. He had a massive brain injury and is currently refusing any therapy or treatment as his physical and mental status spiral.  His Chief of Staff signaled the alarm:   >His 1,600-word email came with the subject line ‚Äúconcerns,‚Äù and it contained a list of them, from the seemingly mundane (‚ÄúHe eats fast food multiple times a day‚Äù) to the scary (‚ÄúWe do not know if he is taking his meds and his behavior frequently suggests he is not‚Äù). ‚ÄúWe often see the kind of warning signs we discussed,‚Äù Jentleson wrote. ‚ÄúConspiratorial thinking; megalomania (for example, he claims to be the most knowledgeable source on Israel and Gaza around but his sources are just what he reads in the news ‚Äî he declines most briefings and never reads memos); high highs and low lows; long, rambling, repetitive and self centered monologues; lying in ways that are painfully, awkwardly obvious to everyone in the room.‚Äù",mowotlarx,2025-05-02T15:35:24,28
"My dad had a stroke in 2018, he was a very buttoned up center left democrat‚Ä¶ he sat me down during bush‚Äôs presidency to explain that saying ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not MY president‚Äù isn‚Äôt helpful and only hurts the opposition. Nowadays he rages at trump on the news with every Cheeto and diaper joke under the sun.  Massive brain trauma will lead to changes in people‚Äôs thought processing, critical thinking, and impulsivity.

"I think he was always kind of a jerk, but the brain injury has sent him off the rails, particularly since it seems like his wife is surprised and alarmed by some of the behavior.

"This is classic psyops. That's what's happening to him. Basicly, gang stalking and gas lighting to control behavior. Usally ends in suicide if the target is unaware of what's happening.
