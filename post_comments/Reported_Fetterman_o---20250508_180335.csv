Democrats suddenly care about a persons mental capabilities to perform their job?  ![gif](giphy|EouEzI5bBR8uk|downsized),jak2125,2025-05-09T00:28:31,9
"He was the darling who couldn't do wrong until he drifted from the scrip.      He's still following it 90% of the time but the cult, like all cults, demands 100% allegiance.",Key-Monk6159,2025-05-08T18:42:16,64
"Just my opinion - people are either capable for a job, or aren’t.  I don’t think Fetterman ever should have been voted in, partly because he’s a dem, but mostly because of his mental capacity after the stroke.    I get it. It sucks to be disabled, and he certainly is.  But there’s probably a better fit out there for his current set of skills and abilities.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-08T18:10:27,64
"Reminder: they had no issue running him despite glaring mental concerns. What changed since?  > *The article’s author went on to state that many of the staffers are not only worried about his fitness as a senator but also that ""he may present a risk to the Democratic Party and maybe even to himself.""*  There it is.",purplebasterd,2025-05-08T20:37:45,11

"His health only became a problem when he started challenging the left's narratives.   Before that, they LOVED him and he could do no wrong.   It really is a cult over there...",TheIncredibleHork,2025-05-08T22:54:32,10
"I tried to listen to him on Joe Rogan, but turned it off after 20 minutes.  Even while using his iPad assisted communication device he wasn’t able to carry on a good conversation.  Joe would ask him one question and he’d answer something else. It was very frustrating to try to follow.",RedditThrowaway-1984,2025-05-08T19:24:40,11
Their just mad at him because he breaks with the party line on certain issues.,ILikestoshare,2025-05-08T20:02:48,9

I would put so many others on the concern list before this guy.   He just doesn’t toe the line.   This is a smear job and we should reject it.,Sregor_Nevets,2025-05-09T06:55:19,1
"Sure. But don’t you think it’s at least a little interesting that the left is suddenly open to this, though?  The right was sounding the alarm bells and saying in October 2022 that he was disabled and got laughed at as “conspiracy nuts” over it. “Oh it’s just a stroke! He’ll be much better and ready to go in two months!” Now, in May 2025, that the left has had enough of him occasionally saying something that makes sense, they suddenly want him booted.  It’s literally Joe Biden all over again. On June 26th, 2024, conservatives everywhere were saying he’s not fit for office. Then you got laughed at for saying it. Then the next day the left suddenly said “he’s not fit! Why didn’t anyone tell us?? Get rid of him!”",superduperm1,2025-05-08T18:37:58,46
"I think you will be hard-pressed to find a whole lot of folks on the right you think he was ever mentally capable of his elected position.    That’s not the point we are making about him.  The point is he has become a bit of a maverick to the left, on some issues he’s pretty moderate and will even side with the right, or Trump on occasion.   So the left has decided, although he was mentally competent up until four weeks ago, everything has changed and now he is no longer mentally competent.",cliffotn,2025-05-08T18:15:17,31
If only we hadn't fielded an actual snake oil salesman against him. ,sunder_and_flame,2025-05-08T19:58:12,10

"It took 20 minutes for the software to get set up properly, it was screwed up in the beginning, once they got it correctly set up it was much more like a normal conversation.",Odin043,2025-05-08T20:14:56,5
"It got better and it was actually a good listen.   He came off as a very common sense kind of person, up until he was challenged about illegal immigration at which point he stuttered and ran back to the default party lines which I thought was very interesting to hear.",queenunderpants,2025-05-09T10:05:51,1
"I wasn’t commenting at all on any of that.  Yes, the left will cast him aside when he’s not a useful tool for them anymore.  Nothing of what I originally stated disagrees with that.  I was originally just sharing a thought.",Narrow-Trash-8839,2025-05-08T19:04:55,8
"With Biden, the Democrats were still saying ""There is nothing wrong with him"" while trying to get rid of him. It was a surreal moment. He is still the crazy aunt in the attic that no one talks about.",AppState1981,2025-05-10T08:06:38,2
