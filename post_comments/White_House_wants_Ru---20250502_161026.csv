">Marco Rubio is expected to serve as both secretary of State and national security adviser for a minimum of six months, and a number of top advisers to President Donald Trump are interested in making the arrangement permanent, according to three senior White House officials.  >His dual role is seen as far more than a short-term solution. “It was not set up to be a stop-gap measure,” one of the officials said.  >Rubio did not seek the role, but was asked by Trump and chief of staff Susie Wiles to step in and take “more fulsome control” of the administration’s overall foreign policy apparatus, according to the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the personnel dynamics.",Goosedukee,2025-05-02T16:11:29,7

He’s not competent and yall really aren’t paying attention if you think he is just because he’s the only one from politics. He’s a traitor just like all of them,blamethestarsnotme,2025-05-02T20:54:06,2
Musk is taking a short vacation required by law governing special govt workers. He will be back.,dicta85,2025-05-02T18:12:16,2
"Yes, because the Trump administration is known for following the rules....  Musk is leaving because he was in it for the money and power.   Both of which he's seeing slip away. Telsas cratering, and he used Telsas assets to afford Twitter. Brazil and Canada both dropped starlink, Amazon just launched a competitor last week, the largest cell phone network in Mexico also dropped starlink, and a deal with Italy seems on indefinite hold.   Heck Musk openly opposed the Trump Tariffs as well cause of the damage they did to him.  Musk likely needs to go put his own house back in order (if that's possible) and I suspect isn't in a hurry to come back and lose it all again.",VanguardAvenger,2025-05-02T18:29:18,2
