"If this blows up in the media, here‚Äôs what happens next:  Garcia is in a black-hole prison with no rights or bodily autonomy. His captors \*will tattoo M S 1 3 on his knuckles by force against his will\*.  POTUS will then produce photos of Garcia‚Äôs newly tatted fingers to prove that the mainstream media is fake news.
