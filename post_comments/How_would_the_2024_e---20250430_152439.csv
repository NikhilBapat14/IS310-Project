Elon Musk can’t be VP. It’s already a Trump-Musk ticket. JD just holds the coats.,AlwaysBananas,2025-04-30T18:54:53,29
"I’m sorry, my eyes just rolled back in my head so far I’m looking backwards just thinking about this.",notacanuckskibum,2025-04-30T18:36:35,9
"Musk's anti-charisma and raw stupidity would have won the debate for Walz. Musk is also incredibly repellant to many people.  However, Harris still ran a shitty campaign and that's why Trump won. I don't think Musk, as painful as he is to watch, would have affected that.  In the end, we got a Trump-Musk White House anyway, of course.",Individual99991,2025-04-30T19:14:31,9
Musk isn't American born.  Not eligible for president so doubtful that he'd be eligible by veep.,LederhosenUnicorn,2025-04-30T19:24:17,4
"They wouldn't win, frankly it's a silly question through and through, but the answer is it'd look much the same but instead of political clip savvy JD it'd be socially awful Elon doing the interviews JD did",Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-01T01:09:00,1
Why not? He can’t be POTUS.,Eric848448,2025-04-30T19:08:42,-4
musk somehow made being an evil billionaire villain lame and criinge. it's amazing.,Mindless-Rooster-533,2025-05-01T01:31:12,2
"More correctly than the other answer, the 12th amendment changed the rules so that the VP must meet the same requirements as the president.  Other people in the line of succession who are not qualified to be president would be skipped for the first valid replacement.",wedgebert,2025-04-30T19:33:01,14
"Because if Trump were unable to perform his duties, Elon would be constitutionally prohibited from taking power.",thatguyworks,2025-04-30T19:15:34,6
"I don't get why people are shocked a billionaire is involved, they always are this one just has no social acumen and Trump has no social Effs to give",Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-01T01:10:17,2
 VPOTUS must be eligible to be POTUS to be elected. Musk is an illegal alien. He’s ineligible to be President or Vice President,Randolpho,2025-04-30T19:57:30,1
That's cause it kinda is lame and cringe since they are usually the shittiest and most cringe people on earth doing it. It's only cool and funny in the movies. ,BKong64,2025-05-01T10:12:26,1
SoS is also in the succession list and I can name at least two secretaries of state that were naturalized citizens.,Eric848448,2025-04-30T19:19:18,-8
"We're not shocked. We're critical of it. If America were doing the whole democracy thing properly, being rich would afford you absolutely zero extra influence in government, because the government is supposed to represent the interests of everyone equally.    And Musk is clearly using government power to enrich himself and shield himself from accountability for his misconduct and possible criminal acts.",rzelln,2025-05-02T11:34:10,2
Illegal alien?  Really?  Show me how.....  Very poor information there Bro.,mrjcall,2025-05-02T13:00:43,0
"The requirements for VP specifically require eligibility to be president. That's not there for other offices.  ""But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States."" -12th amendment",omni42,2025-04-30T19:42:24,16
"I mean you can say ""if Americans"" as if it's an isolated incident but that's absolutely not true, it's in every government democratic or otherwise that those with wealth and influence have more influence.  And furthermore we need evidence of enrichment and criminal acts. I saw several contracts with the government from SpaceX to Tesla got cancelled as of the doge cuts and as to the legality of it well that's not up to you it's up to a judge.",Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-02T11:40:55,0
"Oh, sorry, he's white, so in your mind he's automatically not an *illegal* alien.",Randolpho,2025-05-02T13:02:07,1
"Just because everyone's being a little corrupt all the time doesn't mean we, like, shouldn't strive to reduce corrupt and create systems to reduce the likelihood of it going forward. Don't you want a country where we actually live up to the ideal of one person one vote, where the government treats the interests of a poor kid who had to run away from home to avoid an abusive family as being just as important as the interests of a billionaire?  As for Musk sucking, there were investigations into misconduct of his various businesses, and he targeted the agencies investigating him. That's not proof, but it's not instilling confidence that Musk *cares* about society actually holding people like him accountable when they do things they shouldn't.  So yeah, it's not up to me to judge, or you, but it is up to us to advocate for a system that *does* get a chance to judge, rather than one where the investigators get defunded and fired. C'mon, dude, don't you want that? Wouldn't that be a good thing we should agree on?",rzelln,2025-05-02T12:16:57,1
"well considering the actual capacity to aid the government the billionaires will always be more important, don't pretend any government is or would be different",Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-02T12:20:12,1
"Well personally I think every billionaire's mere fact of having billions of dollars is actually making the work of the government harder, because those people shouldn't have that money. They didn't earn it; they leveraged it out of the people who did the labor.  Every billionaire is a thief, and the government should be prosecuting them, not working with the motherfuckers.",rzelln,2025-05-02T12:25:47,1
Those people shouldn't have that money? It's even sillier that you think you can make such a judgement. But this is reddit and you clearly take yourself seriously,Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-02T12:27:19,1
"I mean, my education about American history has always highlighted the victories when the public at large was able to rein in the power of elites. The Revolution itself, the end of slavery, reforms for workers rights after the Gilded Age.  A democracy shouldn't have billionaires. Sure, all economic activity has some element of coercion to it, but nobody does labor to earn a billion dollars; nobody lives long enough for that. You only get to billions by claiming a share of the wealth a bunch of other people produce.  If you can see that feudalism was wrong, and that slavery was wrong, and that child labor and company stores were wrong, and that sweat shops are wrong, I don't think it should be a big leap to see that, even if it's less viscerally dangerous, to extract a bit of wealth from millions of people is also extremely coercive. It's exploitation.",rzelln,2025-05-02T12:34:22,1
"""a democracy shouldn't have billionaires"" lmao  1 were a constitutional republic, democracies are failures  2 nothing about any democratic system is anti billionaires by its nature Well this is true as long as you aren't one of those goofy lost souls that thinks socialism/Marxism is democratic",Accomplished_Pie_732,2025-05-02T12:36:31,1
"What do you do for a living, may I ask? I'm curious how much you've thought about economics and what makes for a stable society in the long term.",rzelln,2025-05-02T12:38:52,1
