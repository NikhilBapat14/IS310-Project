AP always takes a while compared to everyone else nothing new or scandalous.,OP_4EVA,2024-11-11T22:22:35,7
"I know that since this post, it's been called, but I can go a little into how the AP (and the media at large) decides to call elections.  Just for starters, the AP doesn't ""predict"" outcomes. Many news stations have realized over the years that calling races as early as possible is good for ratings. If your station shows results earlier, people are going to want to watch your station to find out the results. This leads to stations effectively calling races when it's ""highly likely"" that a candidate wins. The AP, on the other hand, basically has zero tolerance for getting it wrong. In the 2024 primaries, the AP called around 2,500 elections. They got 2 wrong, which they later had to issue corrections for, but 1 of those errors was due to misreporting by election officials.  Describing how they actually call elections is a fairly complicated subject because it relies on statistical analysis from many sources. Simply put, the election result is called when the AP decides that it is no longer possible for the trailing candidate to win.   For instance, you can look at voter rolls. Party registration and the most recent voting date are accessible in publicly available records. They use this and other data to determine how people are voting, either by election day voting, early voting, mail in ballots, etc. You can closely track how elections are going and if things like party registration, voter turnout, and the current count (by ballot type) are indicative that one of the candidates can no longer win the election, the race will be called.",Mad_Dizzle,2024-11-12T08:54:47,4
The AP is well-known for its conservative bias. /s,hgqaikop,2024-11-11T21:31:38,0
"But they called every other race, just not that one race.",GTRacer1972,2024-11-12T16:49:00,0
"Uhhhh No.   The AP is conservative with regards to how/when is calls elections.   But that doesn't mean it has a Republican bias or conservative ideological bias.   The AP invented the concept of ""calling"" an election 150+ years ago.   Only in modern times with 24 hour news cycles was the incentive to be the first to call a race.   For 130+ years networks, newspapers, radio stations would wait on the AP to make a call before they reported on it.   Only in recent years has every TV channel in-housed thier own election calling teams.",Xing_the_Rubicon,2024-11-11T23:45:15,-5
"The person above used something called a tone designator, which is what the /s at the end is for.  The s in this case stands for sarcasm.  So the user above doesn't actually think they're conservative in the ideological sense as the statement was sarcastic.",CenturiousUbiquitous,2024-11-11T23:50:19,5
