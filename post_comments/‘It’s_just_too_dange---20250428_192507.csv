"This is absolutely for the best and probably unavoidable.  The US doesn't just require that ""all visas must reflect an applicant's sex at birth."" They are also issuing lifetime bans on anyone who applies for a visa using ID that *isn't* their assigned sex, for ""material fraud"".  If he, Bells LArsen, or any other trans Canadians have updated their ID there, it's likely they no longer have the ability to enter the US at all.",tgjer,2025-04-28T20:12:34,51

">Montreal-based singer-songwriter, Bells Larsen who is transgender, also recently announced the cancellation of his U.S. shows after he was told his application for a U.S. visa was likely to be denied based on his gender identity.  >He is now in the process of refunding fans for tickets to shows scheduled in Boston and New York City, along with several dates across California in Beacon, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Healdsburg, Arcata and Merced where he was slated to treat his audience to his lo-fi ‘90s indie sound and folk ballads.  >“I received an email ... from the American Federation of Musicians stating that I am no longer able to apply for a Visa because U.S. Immigration now only recognizes identification that corresponds with one’s assigned sex at birth,” he wrote in an online post.  >The Instagram post goes on to say “To put it plainly, because I’m trans (and have an M on my passport), I can’t tour in the United States.”  Christian nationalists have turned America into the country that others flee from. Christian nationalists have turned America into a Christian Iran.     No one seems to care that we are emulating 1933 Germany day in and day out. There should be alarms ringing loudly right now, because Christian nationalists are waging a genocide right now in America.",southpawFA,2025-04-28T19:30:50,61
This will no doubt make some happy.   And it'll no doubt lose people money.   It'll be interesting to see which one wins out within the GOP: bigotry or greed.,Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-28T19:36:15,10
"My favourite podcast is doing a US tour soon. One of the hosts is trans and lives in the UK the other two are in the US. Far as I know it's the first time all three hosts would be together for shows. But the UK host had huge legal trouble just getting a visa, and has now decided not to go because it would just be too dangerous.   I'm in NZ, so couldn't go anyway, but still seriously gutted I won't get to hear them together live.   Thus shit is so shitty.",tehifimk2,2025-04-28T20:01:00,7

Why does it even matter?   and then secondly, why not just make all toilets unisex?

Unless you can prove every state in America is unsafe to live in as LGBT that’s not going to happen.  You’d likely be denied and told to move to an LGBT friendly state like California or New York as these states are highly unlikely to ever comply with anti lgbt Trump demands.,Deep_Alps7150,2025-04-29T01:33:18,0
