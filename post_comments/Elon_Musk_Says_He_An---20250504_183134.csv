"From reporter Jazmin Tolliver:  Elon Musk said he and President Donald Trump ‚Äúalmost always agree‚Äù on the same issues.  In an interview with Fox News‚Äô Lara Trump on Saturday, the tech billionaire told Trump‚Äôs daughter-in-law that he considers the Republican leader a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù while discussing the dynamics of their working relationship.  While Musk claims to be on good terms with the president, Trump took a pointed dig at him and other tech giants last week.
