It is the first time in history an American President woke up and decided he wanted a global recession. It's almost like Russia is having him destroy the Dollar and the American economy.

"Trump is definitely one of the dumbest assholes who ever lived.  Combine that with his narcissism and vindictiveness, and stupid voters giving him back the Presidency, and you’re facing one of the biggest economic disasters in history.  Every day of his second term has been another drama.  More chaos.  More confusion.  People being grabbed off the street and arrested.  Deportation flights with no due process.  Judicial rulings being ignored.  Allies being blackmailed.  Countries being threatened with annexation.  You’re only just over 100 days in to this term.

"> I hate to say it but Putin is actually pretty intelligent.  His decision to invade Ukraine belies that.  As a general rule, Dictators are extremely stupid, or at least they aren't smart enough to overcome their own anger, greed, and paranoia.  Hitler didn't so much, ""restore Germany's economy,"" as he, ""blatantly ignored the terms of Treaty of Versailles and dared the world to do anything about it.""  Yes, choosing to violate the treaty that keeps you hobbled probably will result in you no longer being hobbled so long as nobody wants to fight you about it, but the kind of asshole who thinks that's a good idea is also the kind of asshole who won't stop there -- they'll go after Poland, France, and finally Russia in the winter, and then it's all over.  These idiots have exactly one play: attack and hope nobody seriously tries to stop them.  They aren't reading the political situation and choosing the right moment; this is what they were going to do anyway and we just don't pay attention to when it doesn't work, because the leaders of dictatorship movements that fail tend to fall like a wet fart.  Every so often, circumstances will conspire to allow the play to see some success, but just because one person wins the lottery every so often doesn't mean that they were a genius.  It just means that they were the lucky shlub whose ticket happened to come up.  Then, circumstances return to normal, their bully act stops working, and the house of cards starts to crumble.  But they don't have a second act so they just keep bullying until the whole house falls.  This situation accelerates as the failures continue to accrue because the bully can't tolerate being told not to bully, so they kick out all the sane advisors who have other ideas about how to navigate the changing environment.  Then when things continue to fail, they get suspicious of even their yes-men because they can't tolerate the idea that they were wrong -- it must be someone else's fault, so they blame the advisors who told them to bully for not telling them to bully even harder.

"Harris said she wouldn’t do things differently than Biden. She promised to keep the status quo that people had been rejecting since Obama. Pushing things like “joy” and ignoring their top-performing ads about grocery prices made her seem out of touch with people and the urgency they want to see towards problems in their daily lives.  The “they/them” ad was effective because it took advantage of Dems not having a clear agenda for change, leaving an opening for the right to lie about DEI. In that ad, Harris is ironically being much clearer about what she supports and why than her usual answers.   “25k down payment assistance for first generation homebuyers” doesn’t really communicate much. It’s not a policy that addresses the cause of a problem. Why is housing expensive in the first place? Trump lies and says immigrants or globalism, but people know what his stance is. Compare that to “universal gender affirming care” and it’s easy to see why one sticks.   Most people really aren’t paying attention to politics closely and don’t think most of it seriously until it affects them. It’s easy to blame the voters for it, but that’s not an excuse for us not to adapt. She should have run as a prosecutor who would use the government to declare war on corruption in corporate America, leaning into the populist desire for reform while holding the elites accountable for a rigged system. She could easily have compared businesses and cartels with her experience.   Instead she says most businesses are doing their best for consumers and only a few “bad apples” are the problem.

Multibillion dollar corporations aren’t reporting record growth? Who cares. They are in a healthy position.   For example Pfizer. They are reporting they will increase their cost cutting efforts by 7.2 billion more dollars on fierce pharma today. Folks got all shaken. Okay, look at their Q4 and Q1 numbers. They are still aimed at 20 billion in the black for the  year. So what does that say? They are fine. They will reduce force in losing areas and reallocate resources to programs that are winners for them.   Look at Novo. They had block buster years with wegovy. Their stock plummeted in the last few weeks. Are we in a crisis? Nope, numbers show them over 25billion in black for that asset alone.   People who don’t invest for a living are the ones panicking.

That might be acceptable to you, but other nations including the U.S won’t allow it. I guess what I’m trying to tell you is the U.S will be participating in this genocide no matter who was in charge. Nothing was going to change this outcome.   >Your screeching isn't going to change the electoral reality I told you. You comply with the bounds dictated to you by the masses or you insist on supporting genocide and keep causing losses.  The electoral reality of the masses is Americans don’t care about genocide. They elected Trump and will now make everything worse, but you don’t want to focus on that, instead you spent your time whining about the “what if’s” and your own steadfast delusion of a reality that doesn’t exist.

">No amount if ""but Trump"" is going to browbeat the masses into making that viable for Democrats  Yet no amount of ""but Biden"" is going to make the two administrations the same on this issue. We don't have to speculate now, we can actually see how they're each handling the issue while they have power.  The entire basis of the argument that ""both sides just want genocide"" was contingent on being able to speculate that they wouldn't conduct themselves differently even though they clearly said they were going to. It was a really weak theory when it was a theory and now it's just completely disproven.  >trying to browbeat the masses into making genocide visble  I don't need to do this, genocide being politically viable is self-evident since the clearly pro-genocide candidate ended up being more popular so we have now shifted national policy in that direction.

"> Because you want israel to keep getting guns/un cover from the US. That's the thing you're deciding to advocate for.  I've not advocated for anything so far, but nice to see you have no shame and are happy to keep on trotting out strawmen instead of engaging in good faith.  What I want - something you probably should have asked me about before criticising a thing you'd not bothered to even find out - is for Israel to be adequately supported and defended by its allies, to the extent it can live peacefully with its neighbours, including a free and sovereign Palestine.   Now, if you'd like to attack me for that, instead of arguing the point ... again ... feel free. At least this time you'll be arguing with my actual position instead of tilting at windmills.  > You see how he isn't even trying anymore?   He? Who the fuck are you talking about now?  > Please explain how Harris isn't complicit in a genocide if she's funding the genocide?  My point was not that she wasn't complicit, and I'm a little surprised you still don't understand that despite having my point spelled out to you several times. I may need crayons if you really don't understand it by now. I'll give it one more go.  My point was that support for Israel is not some binary where it's either you're pro-genocide or anti-genocide. That's what those adults I keep telling you about understand. It is a complex situation.   Now, as to whether she actually *is* complicit, I don't think she is or was. What Israel has done and continues to do in Gaza is horrendous, but Harris was not the President who got to decide where the US stood on that issue. So calling her complicit is a little moronic, that's like claiming the guy who shined Biden's shoes was complicit, he had the same power over US arms sales. Or every American taxpayer was complicit. Or everyone who ever gave money to an American company was complicit. Complicity is not established by mere proximity.  Was she likely to carry on the same exact policies and make herself complicit if elected? Maybe, but most coherent voices appear to share the opinion she was more of a pro-Palestine voice than Biden was. She's on record calling for ""an immediate cease-fire"". She has a history of [pushing for more consideration for the people of Gaza](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/14/kamala-harris-gaza-palestinians-00131633). Those are good things. She's on record saying Israel has ""every right to defend itself"", which is weasel words that can be interpreted many ways, a non-committal answer. She's said should wouldn't support blocking arms sales to Israel, which is consistent with that ""adequately supported and defended by its allies"" bit I mentioned earlier. Sorry, you need more than that to convince me that she had a firm position at all, let alone a pro-genocide one.   What did her critics say? Did she get attacked during and after the campaign by zionists claiming she lost because she didn't support Israel enough? Yes, yes she did. Did her political opponents call her a strong supporter of Israel? No, they claimed Israel would vanish if she was elected.   Maybe the most important question, though, is ... was she better or worse than the only other option (a [reminder](https://www.instagram.com/realdonaldtrump/reel/DGhfpgHsOg6/?hl=en-gb) of the other option)? You'd have to be completely braindead to think the other option was better.  I'll end with this - a quote from her nomination acceptance speech. I think those are pretty much exactly the right goals.  > At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost, desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.",DaveChild,2025-05-02T03:07:34,1

">Progressive policies are more popular than progressives in polling, so it’s not that voters hate the content of the messaging.  You're making two big mistakes :  1 - Just because voters like a specific policy doesn't mean they'll vote on it.  There's a lot of people who believe that the rich deserve more taxes, there should be government healthcare for everyone, and the US should be a white christian theocracy.  So government healthcare may poll well, but what do you think they vote for in the booth?  2 - Voters don't read/give a shit about a candidates specific policies at all.  Most voters are vibe based and spend 0 time researching policy.  Hell I'd bet 75% of the people here in a politics forum didn't read the policy pages of their candidates.  So it doesn't matter what policies a candidate throws out if there's no vibes.    And the media has made sure that candidates with progressive vibes are well loved by about 35% of the voting public and loathed by about 50%.",nowander,2025-05-01T11:15:32,0

"""Wasn't going to happen.""  It did happen. Those were the only options and liberals chose to cause the loss.  ""And yet there wasn't going to be""  There either was going to be or the Dem nominee was going to be nonviable. There wasn't going to be a viable Dem gebocidaire. Again liberals chose to cause the loss at the point of nomination.  """"Mass slaughter""""  Putting mass slaughter in scare quotes is mask off.   ""Most Americans don't really give a shit.""  Wrong. 77% of Democrats and 62% of independents opposed sending arms to Israel and it was a major factor for a significant portion of the electorate. Polling in multiple swing states showed thay supporting an arms embargo made 35% more likely to vote for Harris and only 7% less likely. The liberals who either supported genocide or didn't consider it a major factor caused the loss at the point of nomination while ignoring hundreds of thousands of registered Democrats voting uncommitted to tell them they wouldn't be voting for a genocidaire nominee.   ""Not a discussion huh""  That's right. I am telling not discussing. You either hold liberals accountable to not cause losses like they caused this one by nominating a nonviable genocidaire or you continue to cause losses while screeching about how you feel entitled to have genocidaire Democrats be viable when they're not and aren't going to be. *I'm* the one informing *you* that nothing you say changes any of that.   ""As I said before the masses don't really give a shit""  Already addressed multiple times. You're objectively wrong. It's the reason Harris wasn't politically viable and those bounds were dictated to you by the masses. If you want to stick your head in the sand and deny that and nominate more genocidaires you will be causing losses.  ""Then Israel will be destroyed""  No they will stop the genocide and comply with international law. If not, they clearly don't want aid or arms and anything that happens is their own doing. You're just rationalizing support for arming fascist mass slaughter and the mask couldn't be any further off.   ""The electoral reality""  No it's what I told you and you are the one denying all of the evidence without any evidence if your own.  ""Blah blah blah""  Your screeching about people not whitewashing Democrats and not supporting genocide won't ever change anything. You comply with the bounds dictated to you by the masses or you cause losses.   But you clearly just personally support arming the genocide so this is over. Other liberals will stop you from nominating genocidaires or they will cause losses.",spicy-chilly,2025-05-01T09:59:10,0

""Genocide being viable is self evident""  For the third time it's not and you're just refusing to listen. 77% of Democrats, 62% of independents, and 38% of republicans opposed sending arms to Israel. Polling showed in multiple swing states that 35% were more likely to vote for Harris had she supported an arms embargo with only 7% less likely. It was objectively not viable.

The reason is political, which is why it’s worth asking if lack of institutional support from the Democratic Party is a reason they’re less popular.

That’s creating the negative vibe you’re talking about, that progressives will somehow radically reshape society until you’ll be cancelled for common sense.   The policies, when separated from that political vibe, are popular among people and usually backed by legitimate economists. There’s no policy problem with progressives, just a political one, and we know moderates have repeatedly painted progressive stances as radical and driven by college activists.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-01T12:23:57,2
