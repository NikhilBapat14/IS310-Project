"It’s not the renewables and it’s not the atmospheric issue. It’s some combination of under investment in a complex but not resilient system. Texas has similar cascade failure but under much higher demand. Apparently the frequency of the current fell slightly at one major station and it shut down to prevent bricking itself then it cascaded from there. Regardless of if the atmospheric phenomenon caused that pressure a resilient system should be able to handle that. It’s like saying you had a heart attack because you had the brownie after Thanksgiving dinner, not because you already ate 5000 calories and had a 90% obstructed coronary artery.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-29T09:40:23,163

"This really is a problem with renewables. Unlike traditional generators they don’t store kinetic energy in giant rotating turbine rotors which can pump energy back in the event of a generator or transmission failure, at least for a few seconds or minutes to give the grid operators time to stabilize the frequency by bringing more generators online or (worst case) load shedding.  They call it spinning reserve. Now sure you could have reserve capacity with renewables and chemical batteries, molten salt, flywheels, etc. but it would require *massive* investment to get anything close to the capacity of conventional generators where it’s inherent to the design.",zip117,2025-04-29T12:24:51,8

"So, you're saying that it has never been both cloudy and calm at the same time in Spain? Totally understandable that they didn't consider that possibility. /S",WoodEyeLie2U,2025-04-29T09:39:07,30
"Not enough in my opinion. I hate how dirty the supposedly 'clean' solar and wind are. Environmental damage from massive solar or wind farms, the battery banks have to be replaced frequently and the mining is atrocious and done in 3rd world countries to get around pollution laws. Nuclear, hydro, and geothermal are the way to go, though hydro has some environmental impact as well. Instead of R&D for solar and wind, we need to be pouring money into nuclear fusion and thorium.",Nianque,2025-04-29T09:56:11,3
