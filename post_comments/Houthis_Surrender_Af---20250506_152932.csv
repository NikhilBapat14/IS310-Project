"They probably got new orders from their Iranian handlers.   Indiscriminately attacking all shipping through the Suez canal was a classic case of friendly fire AOE damage - those attacks had ripple effects negatively affecting the economy of EVERY Arab state in the region, including Iran.   I'm sure Iran told them to focus on specific attacks aimed at Israel rather than AOE aggro'ing ships from every nation on the planet.",Teary_Oberon,2025-05-06T18:00:25,24

You mean all it took to get the bad guys to stop was to show a little backbone and flex a little muscle?  Who would have thought of that?,Mehnard,2025-05-07T04:42:41,5
