"Shocker...  Trump obviously never learned his lesson because during his first term, he managed to increase the US trade deficit after starting a trade war with China that hurt American businesses and consumers BIGLY, and despite his claims that aggressive tariff policies would balance the trade deficit.  Nothing has changed this time around except for the fact that Trump's trade policies are even more reckless and haphazard, and he continues to bully and alienate trade allies while insisting that he will singlehandedly reduce the trade deficit.  What's worse is how Trump's policies have incentivized some of our largest trading partners to turn to China, while under Biden, we were in a much better position to economically isolate them.  We should all be concerned, because the fact is, China's economy has grown and expanded rapidly in recent years. They have the means, the resources, the workforce, the manufacturing capacity, the bureaucratic power, the facilities and Infrastructure, and the economic resiliency to outmatch and outpace the US nine times out of ten if it comes down to a trade war.  And this wouldn't be as literal if it weren't for Trump's continuing efforts to economically insulate the United States from the rest of the world.  And what's particularly frustrating is how Trump and his allies have managed to convince their voters that this is all ""part of the plan,"" that Trump is playing ""3D chess,"" despite his failure thus far to ""negotiate"" any meaningful trade deals, and despite his ongoing escalation of both economic and diplomatic tensions between the US and other countries.  These countries aren't ""kissing his ass."" Instead, many are being forced to take a harsher stance against the US. It's like Trump is welcoming retaliation. Which by the way, has the opposite intended effect when it comes to balancing the trade deficit and spurring domestic manufacturing, jobs and innovation.  I realized recently that this justification for Trump's volatile trade agenda, which claims that the US is just righting wrongs and pushing back against all the ""unfair"" treatment it's endured over the years, is merely an extension of the right's persecution complex, but on a global scale.  They almost always find a way to rationalize implementing these types of excessive and chaotic policies because they are ever the victims, without exception. *They* are the ones being ceaselessly oppressed by the powers that be, by all the evils in the world that are mistreating *them*  And what's baffling about this is how the United States has spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of this global trade system, profiting immensely off of it along the way while contributing to world wide disparities in wealth, power, resources and political and socioeconomic capital.   Not to mention that during this time, the US was also asserting itself as the world's globocop and ""liberator,"" further galvanizing the country as a dominant world superpower.   So, let me get this straight. We're the victims of a system that we forcibly built and have disproportionately benefitted from at the great expense of hundreds of millions, if not *billions* of others?

That’s good - more net financial assets for the private sector. If you were to reduce that then you’d reduce money in the banks of private sector and slow the economy even further.,CurrencyUser,2025-05-07T03:57:07,0
