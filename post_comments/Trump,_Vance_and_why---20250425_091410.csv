"Vance really did off the pope, huh?",Kop_f_u,2025-04-25T09:16:56,23
"Newly converted trad Catholics act like evangelicals and hated pope Francis for being  ""woke"" . They want a theocracy and are not going to stand for a protestant to lead that. Evangelicals and trad caths are just using each other to get to the top and then will try to off each other.  ",Designer-Contract852,2025-04-25T09:38:33,18
"It's kind of weird that it took so long for the most bigoted Americans to find the Catholic Church, then again it was probably their bigotry that kept them from it in the first place.",Odd-Milk-250,2025-04-25T09:23:32,8
">Within Trump’s circle are a number of prominent Catholics, including Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, who wears a prominent gold cross pendant in the media briefing room.  >“I certainly believe in spiritual warfare,” she told the Christian Broadcasting Network in March. “And I think I saw it first hand, especially throughout the campaign trail with President Trump.”  No such thing as ""spiritual warfare."" You're just a bitter asshole who refuses to go to counseling, and there are flickering moments of cognitive dissonance, during which you realize your thoughts are stupid and silly, and normal people are laughing at you.",StreamisMundi,2025-04-25T09:34:37,15
the evangelical base may have a problem with this.,chmod777,2025-04-25T09:56:46,3
The Catholic Church existed before the USA and will exist after Trump. The cardinals may choose a conservative but I doubt they will choose a Trump toadie.,kami246,2025-04-25T09:46:40,3

The Catholic Church have very accurately assessed Trump as being third rate.   They have therefore appropriately placed him on the third row at the Pope's funeral.,crazybones,2025-04-25T11:14:04,1
"Correct. The amount of 'trad caths' that actually should call themselves 'virulently evangelical' is too high.  I grew up in a 'trad Cath' country (Latin America), and American right wingers make even the most right-wing Catholics there look like woke Franciscans.",HarwellDekatron,2025-04-25T15:16:36,3

"There absolutely is a thing called ""spiritual warfare"".  We used  to call spiritual warfare a crusade or jihad.  Spiritual Warfare is simply when one group of humans uses the fact that that other group of humans they hate has different ideas on religion than they do to justify murdering that other group.",KimmyT1436,2025-04-25T11:12:50,9

Bullshit! After George Washington took the British airports he established the Catholic Church and Coca-Cola.  /s,pokeshack,2025-04-25T09:52:55,8
"If someone tells me they are hunting for bigfoot, they used words to describe an abstract concept that is not in tune with reality.  Spiritual warfare is not real. It's made up. It's untreated mental illness and unfixable stupidity.",StreamisMundi,2025-04-25T16:21:38,-1
