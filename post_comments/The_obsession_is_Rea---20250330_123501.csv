"What's wild and unfortunate is normally a new President is not responsible for the economy the first couple of quarters. The Fed is independent and executive orders can't do much in the short run and it obviously takes a while for Congress to pass and implement a new budget   But Trump's policies have been so catastrophic you can draw a direct line between him and the immediate economic slowdown by starting several trade wars. Unfortunately we are living through history, because no President before has been this bad at it, even Trump's first term.",SlapHappyDude,2025-03-30T23:31:30,7
