"But hey, let's focus on Hunter Biden for years, though...",omerome83,2025-05-05T15:13:02,49
"""*I trust a businessman to run the country*""  The Republican party spent the better part of the last 4 years launching half-baked, bogus inquiries and partisan investigations into the so-called ""Biden crime family."" But their histrionics amounted to nothing more than a waste of time, energy and resources.   And the real frustrating part is how most of their allegations against Joe Biden are far more credible when levied against the Trump family.  For instance:  The Trump family and associates are currently set to receive 75% of the net protocol revenues from the World Liberty Financial project, which will amount to over $300 million based on initial valuation.  And when it comes to Trump's recent crypto scheme, it's been reported that his family and their affiliates have brought in millions in trading fees from $TRUMP, and this was right before the coins value crashed, causing thousands of investors to lose (collectively) nearly $2 billion after investing in the Trump ""memecoin.""  > The Trump family and their partners have yielded almost $100 million just in trading fees from $TRUMP,   > More than 813,000 crypto wallets have lost a total of $2 billion after buying President Donald Trump‚Äôs memecoin  These early buyers were direct affiliates to the Trump organization. This was plain corruption and there's no excuse for it, and despite Trump's efforts to play coy in front of reporters.  moving on:  Trump has spent his entire life and career taking advantage of his power and privilege to enrich himself at the expense of others.  During his presidency, Trump committed to improving Chinese IP protections and opening up its financial sector to US businesses, which conflicted with his personal real estate ambitions in China, including dozens of properties and hotels.  In 2020, it was revealed that Trump also had previously undisclosed bank accounts in China and during his first term, his family benefitted financially from trademarks from the Chinese government.  **Trump the ""business man"":**  Trump is a notorious financial fraud who has bankrupted or crippled practically every business, product, or service that he's tried to slap his name on. He has profited off of this by leveraging other people's money to make bankruptcy work for him.  Here's a long list of Trump's business failures:  - Trump Casinos and Hotels  - Trump University (The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative) - Trump Magazine - Trump Airlines - Trump Beverages - Trump ""The Game"" (yes a Donald Trump boardgame) - Trump Mortgages - Trump Steaks - Trump Travel Site - Trumpnet - Trump Tower Tampa - Trump Vodka - Trump Fragrances - Trump Mattress - Trump Network - Tour de Trump - Trumped! (Trump Radio) - Truth Social (due to its wild overvaluation and massive losses.)  He has been involved in over 4,000 legal cases, many of which include financial crimes.  Trump has profited off of screwing over small businesses and financial associates who had the misfortune of trusting him with their money or labor.   He has also profited off of lying about his wealth and the value of his properties, he even lied to get on the Forbes list, and he often threatens to sue anyone who publicly speculates about his real net worth.  Over a period of time between the '80s and '90s, Donald Trump had lost more money than any other American taxpayer. But he continued borrowing money, particularly from his father and from banks, which allowed him to avoid paying income tax for many years, all while he amassed unsustainable debts, only to dump them onto others later.  Then his lucky break, The Apprentice. The show played a significant role in boosting his income and public image.  This isn't even the half of it, but it's clear so far that Donald Trump is not the economic genius he's touted as by both him and his supporters. He's simply spent his entire life cashing in on his circumstances at the expense of others.  Let's not forget about Trump's recent felony convictions for falsifying business records in order to conceal a crime.  During his first term, Trump was forced to pay more than $2 million in court-ordered damages to eight different charities for illegally misusing charitable funds at the Trump Foundation for political purposes  Additionally, as part of the settlement, Trump was required to acknowledge his personal misuse of funds at the Trump Foundation. The settlement also included mandatory training requirements for Don  Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump. Finally, the settlement required the Trump Foundation to shutter its doors and dissolve under court supervision.  Then there's Trump University...  In 2013, A lawsuit was filed by New York's AG, accusing Trump of defrauding thousands of people who attended Trump University. New York regulators forced Trump to stop using the term ""university"" to describe his scheme, calling Trump's use of the word, ""misleading and even illegal.""  Former students recount being pressured to provide high approval ratings for the courses they were taking, or have their graduation certificates withheld. Thousands of students sought course refunds and claimed that they never received any benefits from the courses.  There was also a separate class action lawsuit against Trump University, Trump's counterclaims were dismissed and he even tried to file a defamation suit against one of the students who made her experiences at the ""university"" public. Trump University was later ordered to pay this student's legal fees and extra costs. Trump was eventually found to have defrauded students and was forced to pay $25 million in restitution.  Trump is also known infamously for not paying what he owes. This includes hundreds of millions in loan forgiveness and legal penalties, and unpaid bills for rally costs at cities around the country.  As president, Donald Trump directed taxpayer money towards his businesses. The secret service and other government parties were forced to overspend at Trump properties and on accommodations.  Trump often made foreign and domestic business deals while president. Booking events for foreign governments at Trump owned locations in order to curry favor with his admin.  Trump promoted his properties while President, and hosted taxpayer funded events.  Prior to his inauguration, Trump met in private with several billionaires. These billionaires pledged millions of dollars towards his presidency and were invited to sit in the VIP section at his inauguration while his supporters stood out in the cold. How symbolic.  These plutocrats, oligarchs and special interests assured Trump that they will be in lockstep with his administration, and an administration that is the richest in US history. Populism my ass...  Trump is a notorious grifter. Selling everything from hats, T-shirts, clothing and accessories, to watches and jewelry, NFTs and digital collectibles, commemorative medallions and coins, Trump currency and trading cards, tacky sneakers, overpriced Bibles, cologne and perfume, among Trump branded merchandise that he continuously suckers his followers into buying. Easy money that typically gets reserved for his legal fees.   Make no mistake here, Donald Trump is not ""America first,"" he is Trump first, *always.* He is always thinking of ways to exploit his power and privilege to enrich himself. He has no reason to stop, in fact, he has an even greater incentive this time around to continue taking advantage of his presidency to deepen his own pockets.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-05T16:54:00,22

"What a change from his 2018 when he acknowledged the Courts determinant role and the goal was to ‚Äúhold‚Äù & not release:  Remarks by President Trump on the Illegal Immigration Crisis and Border Security  IMMIGRATION Issued on: November 1, 2018   At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our southern border. Some people call it an ‚Äúinvasion.‚Äù It‚Äôs like an invasion. They have violently overrun the Mexican border. An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language ‚Äî by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get ‚Äî they‚Äôre given a phrase to read. They never heard of the phrase before. They don‚Äôt believe in the phrase. But they‚Äôre given a little legal statement to read, and they read it. And now, all of a sudden, they‚Äôre supposed to qualify. You saw that two days ago. These are tough people, in many cases. A lot of young men, strong men. And a lot of men that maybe we don‚Äôt want in our country. But again, we‚Äôll find that out through the legal process.   These policies lead to the release of illegal aliens into our communities after they‚Äôve been apprehended. But we‚Äôre not releasing anymore. Big change, as of a couple of days ago. We‚Äôre going to no longer release. We‚Äôre going to catch; we‚Äôre not going to release. They‚Äôre going to stay with us until the deportation hearing or the asylum hearing takes place. So we‚Äôre not releasing them into the community.   The court process will takes years sometimes for them to attend. Well, we‚Äôre not releasing them into our country any longer. They‚Äôll wait for long periods of time. We‚Äôre putting up massive cities of tents. The military is helping us incredibly well.   Q But in terms of your plans to change asylum, are you going to do this via executive order?  THE PRESIDENT: No, no, you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to release. You have ‚Äî you can hold. The problem is, to hold people, you need massive facilities. It‚Äôs the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever heard. Another country says, ‚ÄúSorry, you can‚Äôt come in.‚Äù With us, we take their name, take their phone number, take their everything, and say, ‚ÄúGood luck.‚Äù Only because we don‚Äôt have the facilities to hold people. But we‚Äôre building the facilities now. We‚Äôre building massive numbers of tents, and we will hold them in tents. But you don‚Äôt have to release them. They released them only because they didn‚Äôt have the facilities to hold them.  Q Mr. President, is there like an executive order that you‚Äôre going to be releasing today?  THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we will be doing an executive order sometime next week, yes.  Q (Inaudible) executive order dealing with ending catch-and-release and asylum?  THE PRESIDENT: It‚Äôs going to end ‚Äî it‚Äôs going to be talking about everything. It‚Äôll be quite comprehensive. Many of the things we‚Äôve talked about today.  Q Mr. President, so you‚Äôre ‚Äî so just to clarify, you are speaking of, in the tents, these family units that would arrive (inaudible) the children?  THE PRESIDENT: Well, we have other facilities also. But what‚Äôs happened is we are holding so many facilities ‚Äî so many people that our facilities are being overrun. They‚Äôre being overrun. And we are putting up temporary facilities. Eventually, people won‚Äôt be coming here anymore when they realize they can‚Äôt get through.  Q Mr. President, when you talk about finalizing a plan to end asylum, is this a plan that would be included in that executive order?  THE PRESIDENT: Oh, no, people are going to have a chance to go for asylum. But if you look at the records, not very many people are allowed to stay once they go to court. But what happens is they‚Äôd go into ‚Äî they were using asylum ‚Äî first of all, they were told what to say by lawyers and others. ‚ÄúRead this statement.‚Äù You read the statement, and now you‚Äôre seeking asylum. The whole thing is ridiculous. And we won‚Äôt put up with it any longer.  Q President Trump, U.S. law and international law says that people who have valid claims have a right to seek asylum.  THE PRESIDENT: That‚Äôs right.  Q So why would ‚Äî why would they be ‚Äî  THE PRESIDENT: Well, they‚Äôre going to go to court. They‚Äôre going to go to court, as crazy as it sounds. They‚Äôre going to go ‚Äî  Q But the law say that they don‚Äôt ‚Äî they‚Äôre not ‚Äî  THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. Excuse me. Ready? They‚Äôre going to go to court, and a judge is going to determine. But usually, when they go to court, they‚Äôre deported. It just seems that most of the people are deported once they go. The problem is they never end up going to court, because when they come in, they‚Äôre told to come back in a year, for a court case, and they disappear into the United States never to be seen again.  But we‚Äôre going to be ‚Äî  Q But the current laws doesn‚Äôt say about holding people in tent cities.  THE PRESIDENT: And they‚Äôre given deportation notices. We will be deporting those people.",WILLIAMEANAJENKINS,2025-05-05T19:51:34,1
