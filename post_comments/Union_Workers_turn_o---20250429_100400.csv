Biden was the first president in history to walk a picket line. Union rights and protections were established by FDR. The Democratic party is the only party that has ever had worker's backs and protected their rights.

I know some union people that voted Trump because they thought the Democrats abandoned unions after [Biden interfered with the railroad strike](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-signs-bill-block-us-railroad-strike-2022-12-02/).   But instead of getting something like that now they are at risk of union busting at the national level and a authoritative dictatorship they have no hope of resisting.

"I'm making $600 less a month since mid January due to my employer cutting all overtime. We are building roughly 2,000 less cars a month. Sales are down, and poor projections means only build what we must. It also means, for us in 2025, a new policy: we are currently 900+ cars ""behind"" due to random downtime due to things breaking (it happens). In the past, for example, we would be working a Saturday, or 2 hrs a day of OT (we averaged atleast an hour of OT a day, now we are getting 0 everyday, going on 4 months now) until we got caught up. Instead, it is reported daily ""we are this amount behind"", but the daily build remains low. They even implemented 1 hour of down time a week per shift to stop production and talk about safety. No urgency to catch up, no suggestion things will get better. All we do know, is so many of our plans are in chaos. They are trying to wait it out & not lay people off, but sales in Q1 are down 4+% & 7+% compared to last year on the two cars we build. That will only go lower as the year progresses.  -$600 a month really hurts me. Hey, I'd love to never work OT again. But I did recently (in September 24) buy a new car after my 20 year old car finally gave up. Plus, I was working a lot & have a long commute, so I wanted something super reliable. I should've known, man. I should've waited til after the election. I regret it, but I had hopium for Kamala.   Sucks, but I've been taking this time to talk to my coworkers about this current moment. Most of them are in the cult hardcore, bit a few just voted for him because they thought he would be good for the economy, and liked the idea, as people who work a lot of OT, of no taxes on overtime. Obviously I tried to warn them, but the majority of these blue collar white men were never going to vote for a woman, let alone a female POC ""elitist"" from California. I really tried to talk sense into them, but had no luck. In my area at work, I have 37 co-workers. 4 of us voted for Haris, 30+ voted for Trump, and I think a few didn't vote at all. That's just the people I work with. This car manufacturing location actually employs 10k people here.

They are malignant.  Trickle down economics is the lie of the century, and that working class Americans continue to fall for it can only be explained by the absolute ignorance of the majority of voters. They're financially illiterate, and as a result are willing to fall for shady sales tactics and lies.  As a result, most aspects of their lives are shitty - they don't earn enough, carry too much debt, and can't manage trying challenges...

"It's not that simple. I can speak for UAW since I am a 2nd generation union member. GOP hates unions, no dispute there, they try to pass right to work legislation in every state they can. Democrats have traditionally held the majority of the union vote. The problem is Democrats just started to take those votes as a given without working on labor issues unions cared about. It started to get really sketchy after Bernie/Hillary because unions tended to support Bernie. Kamela made a couple of bad statements on the campaign trail and really butted heads with the Teamsters during the campaign. I can tell you a big component was Trumps intention to kill NAFTA as part of his tariff spray and pray, and  that appeals to a lot of people in the midwest that have lost a shitload of factories since the 90s. The problem Democrats have is they won't stop talking about Trump, and Trump won't stop talking about Trump, but people desperately want to see some plan of action or agenda that solved some of the labor and manufacturing issues, and neither side is doing it competently. Right now, you are probably looking at a more 50/50ish split for most unions compared to the past. If you want those votes, you need to go after them, I think they are up for grabs on either side.  If Trump's concepts of a plan and chaos actually lead to no tax on overtime and increased blue-collar union jobs, Democrats might be in trouble, to be honest. If Trumps actions shrink the unions from layoffs and other problems, it will sway back. I would say Democrats should strongly consider adopting the no tax on overtime policy and other workers' rights issues, like paid paternity/maternity leave, raising the federal minimum wage, and being very against right to work laws.",Corbear41,2025-04-30T01:06:42,1
