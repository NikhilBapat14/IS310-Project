Unfortunately I’ve witnessed first hand some of the cuts taking a few critical services away from a few of those that really need it the most and it’s heartbreaking.   I hope that we once the fog clears we can reinstate some essentials for children and the homeless.,Darstanter,2025-05-02T12:13:49,121
DOGE probably gave this young man more practical world experience than spending 4 years at Harvard.,SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T09:37:23,67
Hoping they will be the successors for a badly needed makeover of the Government Accounting Office which failed in their responsibilities.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-02T10:13:58,-4

"Crazy how in the conservative sub, you always have these supposed conservatives saying shit like “YEAH BUT HERES ACTUALLY WHY CUTTING GOVERNMENT SPENDING IS BAD!!”  Meanwhile in lib subreddits, you have people openly cheering on violence and saying that it should be done. Crazy how manipulated this sub is.",Running_Gamer,2025-05-02T15:57:29,-5
"Very few times in life can you root out the bad without clipping some of the good. You pull weeds your gonna get some grass, you do treat cancer you will get good cells with it, you go after terrorist there will be innocent casualties.   The real bad person isn’t the one treating the issue but the ones who let the problem grow and spread. We need a hard reboot on government spending and that bandaid is gonna hurt to rip off but we will be better for it.",Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-02T15:34:06,2

They didn’t fail. They did exactly as they were meant to do. Nothing.,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-05-02T11:05:45,9
"I’m no “supposed conservative” I am a simple conservative who also happens to be witness to some of the additional cuts and some of the impact it has had.     I’m not being emotional, sarcastic or bitter. I am however being hopeful that the federal support that was really helping the those that can, assist those that needed it most, will come back someday.  That’s all, it’s a wish and a prayer.",Darstanter,2025-05-02T20:26:40,26

Foodbanks replying on federal programs have been gutted. TN just lost 700K worth of food that would go directly to those that need it especially kids.....wiped. Local Volunteers that relied on a pittance in grants that were assisting already overrun operations for the worst off of us are now completely cancelled state wide as well.  People currently running out of stocked food and our local growers are having a hard time getting enough to help.  Churches are doing what they can... all of this feels like an oversite more than an intent.     I am praying that we gain enough resources back that we can assist those that need it most.,Darstanter,2025-05-02T15:34:12,34
You still yet to give your first hand evidence of what was cut as mentioned earlier.,Omecore65,2025-05-03T23:22:56,6
"Baby boomers control $78TRILLION of wealth. If they would use just a fraction of their wealth, they could eliminate poverty in this country. We don't need the fed gov to do it. We just need boomers to step up.",HomeOfTheBRAAVE,2025-05-02T18:19:51,-11
"Sure, but while they aren’t, I don’t know of a way else to get it to the children and those who need it most.",Darstanter,2025-05-02T20:28:10,12
