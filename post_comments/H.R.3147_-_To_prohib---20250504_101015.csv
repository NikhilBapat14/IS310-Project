"It won't matter that we won't be able to breathe the air when we'll all be working in factories like our grandfathers. Nothing says progress like destruction of everything we stand for and stand idly by as our flag metaphorically burns. Instead of rockets and bombs bursting to give proof that our flag still flies in the darkest of times, it is its own flames that we watch in horror.  National forests will be deforested for lumber, pipelines will go through sacred lands, coal production with fewer regulations will increase, and this will happen alongside all of our social programs collapsing. Rural hospitals will close and residents in those areas will have no health insurance and therefore, be left to die. Education will become only accessible to the wealthy. Trump is actively burning down our entire way of life so that the administration can completely rewrite history. Remember, the Enola Gay is the Enola Straight now.  The Gulf of Mexico was just the beginning. This is very obviously a global game and anyone that opposes anything happening has no future. US citizens can be deported now.

"Considering that the ""social cost"" was suppressed for quite some time by oil conglomerates, I really hope this doesn't pass. I kinda want to be able to reach old age without constant heat strokes and the like.  Wasn't too long ago that a massive heat wave killed a bunch of people in Washington State? That doesn't normally happen.   Wild fires are getting worse in the southwest due to drought and excessive heat sucking the water from cacti. It's literally too hot for cactuses and not enough rain.  Remember that time there was a literal hole in the ozone layer and humanity banded together to get rid of it? Or acid rain? You know, that stuff that falls from the sky and melts your face(slight exaggeration, but chemical burns are no joke, especially when it's in literal rainfall).  We're at a critical point where we can trust in science and scientists to help us fix this shit while we, as humanity, stall for time. We almost died from starvation not too long ago. We almost died from nuclear war many times. We, as humanity, nearly kill ourselves fairly consistently with our creations, not underdtanding the ramifications of what we're doing.   This, we know what we're doing. We know how bad it is. We know what we're causing. What's worse? Greed has allowed the spread of targeted misinformation designed to allow the already rich and powerful to extract every last dollar from the Earth before it succumbs to our consumerism.  Just because we can't see the effects doesn't mean it's not happening. Just because it's ""barely"" a thing now doesn't mean we don't have a social responsibility to provide a better world to our children. I can't be the only person who learned growing up that when you borrow something, you leave it better than you found it. We are borrowing the Earth from our children, our grandchildren, and so on.  Steady, generational progress is what we should be aiming for. Steady increases in the standard of living as technology improves. Steady increases to the rights of man as people interact with each other, and we abandon our bigoted ways. Steady decreases in crime as poverty is eradicated. We've seen all of these things, but we have the same amount of greed that we've always had, possibly more as people gained the rights and abilities to move up in the social hierarchy.  Make no mistake; it is greed that causes companies to spread misinformation. It is greed that spreads it. It is greed that creates the basis for destruction.  I am not saying to give up wealth. In fact, wealth can be a healthy motivator for innovation. As companies naturally form monopolies and become ubiquitous, they alter what we as a people consider to be our standard of living. Power companies granted monopolies to provide electricity so you can be subjected to my bullshit in the first place.  Phone lines, international internet cables, water, and bridges.  Originally created for profit.  I am not saying to nationalize these resources, although the government could probably use a sovereign wealth fund that contains dividend companies exclusively, making all of us stakeholders in those companies. Also, it would help reduce the tax burden as the fund grows and the economy becomes backed in a tertiary manner by actual value instead of the trust we put in paper.  I am saying that eventually, people see the light in turning a water company into a utility as water collection and distribution become ubiquitous and necessary to the standard of living. Some things need to be provided to the masses at reasonable rates as technology advances.  One of these things is definitely an atmosphere capable of sustaining life in the long term. The Federal Government needs to look at the long-term projections of the societal cost due to the necessity of ensuring its own long-term survival. It can not survive if humanity breaks down due to storms detroying our infrastructure, people unable to leave their caves lest their faces melt, all the trees reaching a critical point where they just die. Sure, we could all live in climate controlled biospheres, but I don't exactly want to live in a society that subsists on the remnants of what we currently take for granted. I don't want our children having to create ways to terraform our own planet. I want them to be able to look at the stars and envision a society where we live amongst them, creating ways to terraform other planets. If we must create domes to live under, let it be under the oceans because it looks like it would be hard to achieve and beautiful to witness, not carefully crafted concrete that robs us of the heavens.
