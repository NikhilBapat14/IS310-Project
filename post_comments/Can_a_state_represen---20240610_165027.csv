"They cannot anywhere in the United States as the Supreme Court has ruled on the matter with a unanimous 9-0 decision in Lindke V. Freed back in March this year.  ""A public official who prevents someone from commenting on the official social media page engages in state action under section 1983 only if the official both (1) possessed actual authority to speak on the state's behalf on a particular matter, and (2) purported to exercise that authority when speaking in the relevant social media posts"" - from the majority opinion written by Amy Coney Barrett.  https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-supreme-court-and-social-media-can-government-officials-block-online-comments",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-06-10T17:36:07,15
"Especially at the local level, politicians may not be well versed in the law, and on something like social media, things may happen simply because noone is filing formal objections.  Has anyone told that rep about the law?  Or filed a notice with the state legislature or any other formal complaint mechanism?  It sounds like a lawsuit could easily win, but for some minor local politician there may be noone who cares enough to file a suit.",zlefin_actual,2024-06-11T08:45:45,3
