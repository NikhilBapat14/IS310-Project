First we have to hope trump follows the ruling.,yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-01T11:30:50,8
Trump will be using the new legal strategy called ignore.,blade944,2025-05-01T11:31:14,2
"And he did it by twisting the definitions.  The act - as I understand it based on this ruling, is the US has to be ""at war"".  Trump basically said ""Oh - I declare war and that it's Venezuelan invading us.""  Ignoring that there's no actual war, no fighting with Venezuela, Congress hasn't declared war, on and on and on.  Basically once again Trump finds lawyers who say ""Well, if you say these magic words then they fit"", and the courts saying ""No.  No you can't.""",Federal_Drummer7105,2025-05-01T15:44:21,2
"I don't see an indication that he's not going to listen to the SCOTUS  based only on what I've seen, not what he said. I understand that is wishful thinking.   Many people will point to his refusal to bring Garcia back as an example of him ignoring orders.  He was not ordered to return Garcia by the Supreme Court. I wish he was. But the Supreme Court took the easy way out and said facilitating, a word that they did not Define that could mean bring him back. It could mean remove all barriers to bring him back. It also could mean don't refuse to take him if the offer is made to return him. I feel this is intentional because you notice how they remain silent while both sides claim they got a 9-0 victory in that ruling.",SoraUsagi,2025-05-01T11:47:38,1
"I think, so long as the SCOTUS agrees with the ruling, Trump will follow it.",SoraUsagi,2025-05-01T11:48:33,1
"This pretzel brain warping of the definition of words might make some sense if it wasn‚Äôt stated explicitly that the detainment was made in error and that he could be returned easily if the government wanted to (aka facilitating).  Link to the court order (it‚Äôs very short):  https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a949_lkhn.pdf  Link to the lack of facilitating (violating said order):  https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdz72lwe1yo.amp  Edit: RIP America, it was nice knowing you while it lasted.",QuicklyQuenchedQuink,2025-05-01T12:44:42,7
"I have no problem learning g when I'm wrong.   I'll read it again, but I'm not seeing anywhere where it says he must be returned.",SoraUsagi,2025-05-01T13:18:34,1
"- government argues it made the detainment process in error - supreme court says the government must facilitate the return of the individual - the government (trump) says he can facilitate, but will not  The only thing you can do here is bend the definition of the word facilitate, but the government is pretty clearly in violation of the order if they refuse to make easy or easier the return - which they are ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to do.",QuicklyQuenchedQuink,2025-05-01T13:35:23,4
