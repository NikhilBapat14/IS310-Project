"How is this not conflict of interest, this is forcing people to use X, and next he will say you need a blue dot for $8 month. If the Democrats aren’t jumping all over this then all will be lost.",h20poIo,2025-04-11T17:52:22,216

This is classic Trump stupidity. Not everyone has or wants a Twitter account. I have no desire to subsidize Elon Musk or expose myself to the rampant hate and vitriol on the platform.,[deleted],2025-04-11T17:36:41,68

"I will NEVER be on that hate filled Nazi platform.  So, I guess if I need to know something, they can email or snail mail me.  Something is really sus about Elon force driving traffic to his failing platform.",Kyrin999,2025-04-11T18:55:30,11
"I am pretty sure this is illegal and breaking a 'reasonable accommodation"" law or something.   Now, if they were using all social media accounts including Bluesky,  then maybe.  But honestly, the vast majority of people on SS are most likely only on Facebook.   On the flip side, I am sure that the standard run of the mill media outlets will be reposting the tweets to keep everyone up to speed.    On the other hand, what is wrong with an email blast?  If they have someone who can post to Twitter then they have someone who can send an email.",crucial_geek,2025-04-11T19:04:12,11

Don't worry folks. Soon Elon and the fatass loser in the white house will have a falling out and SSA will no longer be posting on X. Instead they will be on Truth Social.,[deleted],2025-04-13T21:03:48,1

It’s egregious and even more so because X doesn’t allow people to read account tweets without signing up for an account. I will not sign up and my bet is that the majority of seniors aren’t going to sign up.,70sBurnOut,2025-04-11T22:05:32,10
