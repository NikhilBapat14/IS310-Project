"If your honeymoon is described as ‚Äúscary‚Äú and ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù, it isn‚Äôt going to get any better.  Remember, they came in with a plan (a scary plan), now they are going to play it by ear.   It won‚Äôt get any less chaotic, and the scary is only getting started.",Gadshill,2025-04-28T14:50:37,46
I don‚Äôt get the American electorate. Literally already went thru 4 yrs of it so why did they think voting for him again would be different?,Romano16,2025-04-28T15:08:35,24
The only reason why things are not worse is because he is incompetent.,nonamenolastname,2025-04-28T14:58:32,14

But some of those same people are the ones who voted for him. üôÑ  This chaos was totally unpredictable! Who would have known this would happen? If only some people would have seen this coming and warned everyone... \*sigh\*,sachiprecious,2025-04-28T14:58:45,3

"Gee you mean he's doing exactly what he said he'd do and exactly what we warned you about like 100 times before the election only for you to dismiss us as ""overreacting""?  Well pardon me if I don't feel bad as leopards eat faces.",Richfor3,2025-04-28T16:48:14,2

"I agree Project Sovereignty 2025 is 'chaotic' and 'scary' and has been the concept of the Trump plan from the beginning. It's word for word taken from this and many of the worst Trump-signed EOs are being pushed forward as new policy.   Trump isn't running the show. He didn't run the show in his first term either if he golfed 285 times, and he definitely isn't running it this time, either.   The Heritage Foundation has leaders from their conservative think tank pushing these EO policies to Trump and out as quickly as humanly possible and controlling a large majority of the government.

Don‚Äôt worry. Those polls are being purged and rewritten. All is fine.,lnin0,2025-04-29T07:05:23,1
I figured it'd be late summer or fall before they lit everything on fire.   Only took a couple of weeks.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-28T14:52:20,17

"As an American, that's the most upsetting part: the 70 million who voted for him again didn't hope it ""would be different,"" they desired an *amplification* of the same; and the tens of millions who *didn't* vote didn't care if we got more of the same.",Terakian,2025-04-28T15:32:09,14

They live in echo chambers that made them think his first term was amazing.,iriefuse024,2025-04-28T16:04:18,3
A massive chunk of the American electorate try and actively ignore politics. They don't remember anything about Trump's first term except that McDonald's was cheaper then.,DiceMadeOfCheese,2025-04-28T17:48:02,3

"Seems to me he's been incredibly successful in implementing his agenda even if it appears chaotic and stupid. People like Russel Vought aren't incompetent and while Trump is putting on a show, they're remaking the government.",Kid_Serious,2025-04-28T15:29:55,5
