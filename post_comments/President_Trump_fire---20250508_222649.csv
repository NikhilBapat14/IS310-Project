"1. Female, 2. Lack of stark White skin = Trump despises her, and so she's fired.",justtakeapill,2025-05-08T22:40:19,21
"A strong, black, intelligent woman in leadership was fired by Trump? Whaaaat, that‚Äôs crazy! It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs threatened by powerful, smart women of color and literacy.",delicioussparkalade,2025-05-08T23:01:36,11
"Hayden, whose 10-year term was set to expire next year, had come under backlash from a conservative advocacy group that had vowed to root out those standing in the way of Trump‚Äôs agenda. The group, American Accountability Foundation, accused her and other library leaders of promoting children‚Äôs books with ‚Äúradical‚Äù content and literary material authored by Trump opponents.  ‚ÄúThe current #LibrarianOfCongress Carla Hayden is woke, anti-Trump, and promotes trans-ing kids,‚Äù AAF said on its X account earlier Thursday, just hours before the firing was made public. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get her OUT and hire a new guy for the job!‚Äù  -  ‚ÄúTransing kids.. the fuck",mylifeforthehorde,2025-05-08T23:16:37,7
"I would like to see some numbers on what percentage of people the Trump administration fired were black, Gay or Hispanic. I am willing to bet the numbers would clearly show that the Trump administration is targeting people of color at a significantly higher rate.",sedatedlife,2025-05-08T23:22:08,6
The Library of Congress is part of the Congressional branch. How come the president has any say in this at all?,econoquist,2025-05-09T00:17:04,5
"He also abruptly fired the Vice Chair of the NTSB who also happens to be Black, seems like a pattern.",Blackbyrn,2025-05-08T23:38:12,2
"I've noticed a sharp uptick of racism on Facebook. You use to never see it. Now, it is everywhere because of Trump, especially on posts from local news. They don't even bother to wear white hoods now.  For example, check out the Facebook comments on Fox News 13 Tampa posts. I had to block them.",ExtremeModerate2024,2025-05-09T00:13:24,1

She was fired because she was black.,Solo_hahaha,2025-05-09T07:33:59,1
"Surprised he didn't do this sooner. Apparently it just wasn't high enough of a priority for him...ONLY the Librarian of Congress after all, who TF cares, right? ü§¨¬†",HansSolo69er,2025-05-09T12:44:37,1

"Do we know if someone's holding a grudge against her for something?  Remember, Trump is that petty.",exophrine,2025-05-09T00:25:31,1
"The fact that she's nonwhite isn't enough, though...don't forget about 'administration' loyalists such as Kash Patel, Vivek Ramaswamy etc. Not to mention Vance's own wife is Indian-American.¬†   It's that she's female, Black (specifically) & apparently a never-Trumper...that's why she had to go. These are the same underlying reasons he's going after Letitia James BTW.",HansSolo69er,2025-05-09T12:49:04,1
