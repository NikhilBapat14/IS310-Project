This is fantastic news.  Kemp was the strongest possible GOP Senate candidate in Georgia.  With him out of the running Dems have a good chance of holding that seat.,AaminMarritza,2025-05-05T19:13:11,16

"If (and when) the Democrats pick up a few people in the house next November, the buck will stop there.  No matter what the Senate margins shift towards (+/- 2).  If Kemp has any hope of continuing in politics he can't jump on the Trump train now.    But Alcatraz and movie tariffs, mother fuckers.",bm1949,2025-05-05T19:52:27,5

I've seen speculation he's got his eye on the 2028 Presidential race.  It's a good theory.  Another possibility is he looked at who'd be in the primary race and decided he just didn't have time for that bitch's shit.,runawaydoctorate,2025-05-05T20:10:55,3
