Not even the GOP trusts trump. This is a lying article.,rodentmaster,2025-04-27T15:04:19,40
"The poll compares Trump to Democrats in Congress, which breaks down 37/30/30/4 (Trump/Congressional Democrats/Neither/Both).  The takeaway should be that about 60% of voters don't trust Trump to run the country, and Trump always gets 35 - 40% on pretty much any poll because MAGA is a cult.",RadioGagaLabHead,2025-04-27T15:03:00,23
"The more polls you read, the less you know.  There are so many badly conducted polls, with badly constructed questions, and results that are internally inconsistent, I can't imagine who thinks they are getting any value out of any of them.  Except newsweek, you never saw a poll  that they couldn't wring 4 stories out of, insisting that the same poll conclusively proved 4 contradictary results.",La-Boheme-1896,2025-04-27T14:56:02,29

What steaming crock of horseshit. Dude lies about basic dinner table issues on the daily and even the cultists are now starting to become aware of it.,Environmental-Arm365,2025-04-27T15:06:06,6

Bullshit. Just because people are upset that Democrats aren't fighting hard enough doesn't mean they trust Trump... whose numbers are tanking with everyone except his cult members. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-27T15:23:47,5
Doubtful. Republicans always screw over the economy. Always.,dropkickninja,2025-04-27T14:54:28,5
Not the true Americans.,StronglyHeldOpinions,2025-04-27T14:57:40,3
I call bullshit.   Trump didn’t even get a majority of the people who voted (49.6%) and over 90 million people stayed home.,llahlahkje,2025-04-27T17:20:55,4
"Well the good thing is Trump won't be on the ballot of 2026 midterm. MAGA is a cult, they show up for Trump and Trump only.   And hopefully by 2028 we would have a strong candidate",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-27T15:00:09,3
"Nope.  My MAGA relatives and in-laws still trust me more, but I am not their cult leader.  To repay a loan, babysit the kids, mow the lawn, cut your hair?  They trust me more.  It is complicated for them.  They seem to enjoy worshipping a capricious and vengeful god that always compromises them more than respecting the neighbor that shows up and feeds the dog while they are in the emergency room.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T15:06:35,3

Hey Newsweek... Newsflash: 90 MILLION ELIGIBLE VOTERS DID NOT FUCKING VOTE. That's more than Trump got. FUCK THE POLLS.,williamgman,2025-04-27T15:37:30,2
Anyone who puts trust in Trump over anyone else is a fucking idiot that shouldn't be out in public without a personal care assistant to ensure they don't walk into traffic.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-27T16:06:43,2
"That's nothing to be astonished at, think about the avg IQ of the Americans. (76, while Chinese has 121)",drzerovector,2025-04-27T14:58:13,3
">It also found that while 60 percent think Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States and 39 percent think he is in touch with them, 69 percent think the Democratic Party is out of touch and 30 percent think the party is in touch with American's concerns.  The moderate/right-wing majority in the Democrat party refuses to budge on for-profit healthcare, dragged their feet with student loans, and did nothing about the housing crisis. Probably the three biggest, most in-your-face problems we've had over the last 5+ years and it seems like they have zero plans on addressing any of those issues.  Progressives are gaining steam by making those issues their focal points but between Republican voters thinking anything that helps Americans is the devil's communism and ye olde Democrats not wanting to lose their corporate sponsors, it doesn't seem like we'll see any real solutions for the rest of this decade.   Tbh, we might need Trump to just implode the whole thing to actually get a Progressive majority in here so we can actually fix problems.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-27T14:57:46,2
"I don't put very much distance between them at all. One, maybe two people at a national level in the past 30 years have earned modest praise.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-27T15:01:59,1
Shows you how bad the Democrat brand is. Does anyone know what they stand for on key issues?  Where's their Project 2025?,ClusterFugazi,2025-04-27T15:20:00,1
At least his voters get what they want. Dems get Chuck Schumer and get told to like it.,The-Real-Number-One,2025-04-27T15:57:43,1

If true Americans are fucking amnesiacs.,bassplayerguy,2025-04-27T18:00:48,1
"The poll shows Trump's support is plummeting, but Democrats still need to change course.  Obviously, the reaction to the disaster of 2024 has to emphasize their vision for the economy instead of the cultural issues, which the GOP have effectively caricatured.  On foreign policy, the kneejerk support for Netanyahu has to end.",deltalitprof,2025-04-27T19:42:04,1
Chuck Schumer is a disgrace,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-27T14:52:46,1
"Exactly. Trump always comes out on top of these things because Republicans support him almost unanimously, while Democrats and Dem leaning Independents are more likely to be critical of the Democratic party.       So Trump just has Democrats and some Independents pulling weighing him down. Democrats have Republicans plus a good sized portion of their own base.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-27T16:05:29,9

Seem like media past few days had been slipping. Had jobs cuts getting to them? Are they going to be reduced to using AI?,Humble-Emphasis5982,2025-04-27T14:59:18,5
This exactly this. Polls are not research. They mean nothing no one should believe anything found by a poll that does not come with a ton of disclaimers and or other research,nickmiele22,2025-04-27T15:00:32,3

"A lot of companies have been populating content with AI for quite some time now. That's part of the reason why a lot of things make absolutely zero sense and are about as reliable as asking an AI to answer a question. At this point, these narratives have basically become feedback loops of hallucinating AIs.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-27T15:47:20,6
"You could have just written, ""I don't understand how polls work.""  Polls actually do come with disclaimers (I don't know about a ""ton"") but they're generally not published in news articles about the polls because editors are under the impression that the public is intelligent enough to understand that polling is not a form of divination. Editors have a lot of faith in the public.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-27T16:02:38,1

"I'm afraid it's far more grim that that. It's using tried-and-tested manipulative algorithm based on what previous methods successfully that drove positive engagement for its desired agenda & negative engagement for opposition. All derived from live, human testing and replicated on unknowing participants who will both never be debriefed or be treated with any regard for the social, physiological, or mental impacts from such neo-ethical, novel experimental marketing models that are *in fact* highly unnatural human experiments.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-27T16:18:28,3
