"What are town halls for?  If I’m democrat, but my representative is Republican. He’s still my representative and I’m allowed to attend any town hall.   Am I mistaken?  From Iowa, but in Kansas now. Same BS happening here.   “Let’s have a town hall in the middle of nowhere so there’s less a chance democrats show up.”    Then we show up and they’re flabbergasted that we want them to represent US too.",gentleoutson,2025-04-28T12:11:55,30

"Yet another example of mixed messaging within a party that constantly outwardly projects unity, while accusing the other side of being mired in disarray.  NRCC first goes the cowardly route early in 2025, when Musk was rightfully viewed as radioactive. However, this year's GOP house congress does not know how to do politics unless it's trolling 24/7. So you end up with senators who had already scheduled town halls who can't afford to look weak, combined with matriculating house members who want to look tough and invite dissent.  We've see a number of GOP voting veterans show up, seeking clarity, only to be violently shut down. You have to wonder though if they won't just blindly keep voting ""R""",PlethoraOfPinatass,2025-04-28T12:45:59,3

Nebraska is doing this.  The republicans are hosting town halls as far away from the population centers as they can.
