"In what is expected to mark her most extensive public remarks since losing to Trump last fall, Harris in a speech in San Francisco on Wednesday plans to urge voters to push back on Trump‚Äôs economic policies and what she will cast as ongoing threats to American institutions and global leadership, according to a person directly familiar with her plans and granted anonymity to discuss them. She also plans to expand on her ‚Äú[courage is contagious](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barack-obama-kamala-harris-criticize-trump-white-house/story?id=120499816)‚Äù theme, the person said.  Her remarks will come during a keynote address to Emerge America, a candidate training program that backs Democratic women, at its 20th anniversary gala. Trump the same week is celebrating his first 100 days in office of his second term.",PapyrusKami74,2025-04-28T12:51:10,24

"I gave you an upvote, but I believe your comment is about ready to get voted down into oblivion. People can‚Äôt agree that she wasn‚Äôt a great candidate to begin with , they will find everything and anything to say she was rooted against, it was sexist, it was racist - but she wasn‚Äôt a popular candidate at all in the 2020 election before she was vice president pick. They picked her to be Biden‚Äôs vice president because she was not a threat to him or the DNC, then all the sudden the DNC expects everyone to be super excited for someone that was vice president to a very weak president.   It‚Äôs not a surprise that we lost, but it‚Äôs like people bitching about the refs after a sports game when they lost by multiple scores. Sure their refs could affect a few points, but they don‚Äôt hand teams blowouts",Lucky-old-boy,2025-04-28T14:17:40,-4

Do you mean a primary without an incumbent on the ballot? *looks around*,chriseargle,2025-04-29T14:45:11,1
I mean a real primary where the party stays out of it and let the voters decide.,ConiferousTurtle,2025-04-29T15:35:51,1
"We **are** the party. **We** voted for the Biden/Harris ticket in 2020 and 2024. **We** voted for the Clinton/Kaine ticket in 2016. If you can‚Äôt accept what we the voters in the Democratic Party decided, be honest about it.",chriseargle,2025-04-29T15:44:22,1
