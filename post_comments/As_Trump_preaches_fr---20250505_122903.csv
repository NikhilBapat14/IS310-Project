"These kinds of headlines are so fucking dumb. There’s no hypocrisy. Stop trying to catch him in a lie, etc. He does not believe that his family is the same as yours. He believes they are genetically superior to you and me, and that his wealth is the result of his extraordinary intelligence. He believes, as his father taught him, that people with brown skin, people who didn’t come from extreme wealth, people with disabilities, etc. are a burden on the world that he envisions, which is catered solely to what he believes are the deserving few. If you keep writing these dumb articles trying to “catch him” you just keep playing into his hand.",freakdageek,2025-05-05T22:48:38,2
