I don't even know what the hell is happening anymore. I was pretty optimistic at the beginning of this year about Trump being focused on American interests in a way that previous administrations haven't been for a very long time  Just because something benefits another country doesn't mean it can't also benefit Americans. That was supposed to be the focus of this administration  At this point it feels like Trump is more worried about how he can take things away from other countries than how it helps Americans,multiple4,2025-05-05T05:51:32,267

I don‚Äôt think he has the statutory power to do this  But why? Is he just trolling because he hates woke Hollywood?   This is one of our largest ip and services net export business. Countries retaliating same will always hurt us 10x worse.   If he wants to encourage domestic film production he should change the tax law to make domestic expenses more favorable in general.

How would you even do this if most movies are a digital commodity now? Does the foreign studio have to pay a tariff to transmit the files?

"Some things you agree with and something‚Äôs you do not and this one I do not. I work 12‚Äôs and one thing I do to pass time is watch movies.

"Their is already a strong protectionism for Hollywood. For decades now, we have been told that Americans are so special and unique in their culture that no foreign movie or show can ever be shown without prior US adaptation, aka American copy of the original.   That's why there are so many 'US versions' of foreign movies and shows. Why do you think they needed a US version of 'the office', a British show ?

"Hear me out. Countries were putting media productions together to play as ads on TV in the US. They were also renting billboards. (Canada)   Canada will say this was innocent and a way to ""get the message to the people about being a good neighbour.""  Reality, though, is that a government from another country should not be trying to instigate a response in political matters. This is considered foreign interference, and the tariffs are likely a way of punishing the governments for their actions.   I don't think foreign interference should be normalized.",Velocipot,2025-05-10T12:43:12,1

The problem is they don't want to it's easy to just go make a film in a country for the incentives so let them.

"How, is easy enough. They're like any other product, although I'm skeptical that we can actually use national security to justify it.  You're right that foreign box office makes us a lot of money. That will change now as other countries will reciprocate. Many films will not be made now in the US because they won't be able to rely on foreign box office sales any longer.
