"Doc here. Read the first two paragraphs and it sounds like opinionated slop.  Our system is flawed. DEI is flawed. But this just sounds like low-quality hate. Maybe more liberal coastal schools teach DEI, but my red-state did not. The bigger issue would just be the young indoctrinated students who believe in it.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-30T02:07:15,38
The United States spends more on healthcare than any country on the planet while having the worst statistical outcomes in the first world.  Somewhere in the ballpark of 100k people die annually in the US from opioids.  Over 250k people die at the hands of doctors due to iatrogenic causes (medical errors) per year in the US.  Anyone surprised by this hasn't been paying attention.,Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-29T21:41:43,-16
"With respect, how many years has it been since you were in med school? Radical change has happened and it's not change for the good. I would not be a patient of any doctor who graduated in the last 10 years.",Theloripalooza,2025-04-30T10:42:07,3

"Graduated in 2018. But we are in training immediately after, so while I was not ""in school"" I was in a University hospital attached to one, with some communication with the Dean of students, who is objectively not into DEI.   Like I said, I am sure some coastal schools are very different. The article even tries to throw in Austin, TX. But if you are going to try to make implications like that, write better and gather real data.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-30T10:52:41,8
"Yeah, you sound like a liberal.  Nope, that is several studies and everything said can be backed up with plenty of evidence.  It isn't ""mUh...jUsT oNe DuMbAsS sTuDy.""  Please study iatrogenesis, then compare and contrast that with murder. I'm not interested in babysitting you or educating you.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-29T23:03:18,-25
