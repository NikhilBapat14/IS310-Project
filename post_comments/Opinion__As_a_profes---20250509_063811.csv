People will speak out once they suffer hard enough.  Think about the average non-voter: their only concerns are for more immediate things and what the latest new distraction to spend money on is. Take those things away and they'll get riled pretty quick I imagine.   It gets real hard to ignore an empty stomach after all.,boywar3,2025-05-09T09:31:30,3
"Sadly, there's also a long history of people staying silent as long as they believe the issues don't affect them directly.  I’ll leave this poem by Martin Niemöller, a German Lutheran pastor who was an early supporter of Hitler but later became one of his outspoken critics. He spent several years in a concentration camp—and wrote these lines as a warning against indifference and moral complacency:  First they came for the Communists, but I said nothing— because I wasn’t a Communist.  Then they came for the Social Democrats, and I stayed silent— because I wasn’t a Social Democrat.  Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn’t speak up— because I wasn’t a trade unionist.  Then they came for the Jews, and still I said nothing— because I wasn’t a Jew.  Then they came for me— and by then, there was no one left to speak for me.",The-Bishop,2025-05-09T09:47:29,2
"Wtf are we supposed to do? Protest? I’ve protested. Most people don’t have power, influence, or time. Why aren’t more celebrities saying something? Do we need to organize mass rallies? Idk man",Massive-Grocery7152,2025-05-09T10:29:51,2
"I think it's evident by now that Trump could declare himself king tomorrow and the only push back he'd get from the American people would be a bunch of mean comments online.   In other words, no one's going to speak up. It seems that the only thing that Americans are going to do is complain that the courts or democrats or anyone else should stand up to the fascist regime they elected. ",Goodk4t,2025-05-09T07:04:37,3
