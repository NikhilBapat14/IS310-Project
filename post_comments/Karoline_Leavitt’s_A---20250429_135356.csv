"**The Emperor’s Tariff:**  The emperor marched with head held high,   His robe unseen by every eye.   ""Behold!"" he cried, ""My plan is grand—   I tax the goods from foreign land.""  But then the Prince of Amazon   Declared, “I’ll post what tariffs dawn—   Each price laid bare for all to see,   What truth your robes won't let you be.”  The emperor flushed with royal rage,   “How dare you spoil my gilded stage!”   Yet shoppers watched their wallets drain,   While empty boasts brought deeper pain.",Potential_Kangaroo69,2025-04-29T14:08:02,382

"It is completely legal to share this information with customers, as much as it is to share the sales tax info or local fees.    Doing this shatters the illusion that tarrifs are a tax on foreign countries, and shows people exactly how much it costs them. It's also a transparent way to show you are not price gouging. In essence, this is a major threat to the story they are weaving.    Forget Amazon. There are plenty of other companies who could be doing this. It needs to become a trend.",HyperbolicLetdown,2025-04-29T19:44:17,6

"Good idea in principle but a colossal PITA for most retailers with tariffs changing on a daily basis and having several layers of effects throughout supply chains. Many companies are already struggling to stay on top of these revolving tariff changes simply in the extra work it takes just to get the products made and shipped, constantly updating price lists, etc, and it's already basically whack-a-mole just to keep up.  Aside from that, there's some extra confusion because the importer pays the tariff. Well in a supply chain, that could be the same entity that's selling the product or the retailer may be a few degrees removed from that. So you'd end up with sort of a mish mash where a lot of products don't *look* tariffed because the final retailer doesn't actually know what the tariff rates were, but the products are absolutely more expensive anyway.  Some companies may have just one or two factories or key suppliers so maybe it's not that hard to track, but for many it would be a total nightmare.",Boomshtick414,2025-04-29T20:17:58,1
