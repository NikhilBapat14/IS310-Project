Can we focus on things that matter?,mojo276,2025-05-08T10:08:28,15
"Glad we're tackling the important issues. I know our majority is thin, but come on. Can we accomplish anything of worth while controlling both houses? I know the President is doing a lot, but let's get some laws in the books",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-08T17:31:10,101
"While I don't see an issue with this in general, I also don't see the need either.  Thought Gulf Of America sounds reasonable considering that it is surrounded by all three. North, Central and South America all border the gulf.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T10:33:37,114

"If this ""doesn't matter"", then why do threads about thie topic get brigaded the most aggressively by leftists?  They know that symbolism is important for power and don't want you to know that too. Keep renaming things, and keep bringing the old names back. It's great that they renamed every base named after a Confederate in memory of George Floyd, and now we're undoing that.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-08T11:24:35,-123

"This would have been done sooner but the checks from the lobbyists for the maps and textbook industry took a while to clear.  And of course, the congressional fund raising off this needed to be optimized.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-08T10:39:21,87

> I also don't see the need either.  Then you fundamentally misunderstand how politics actually works (life isn't Schoolhouse Rock) and you're part of the reason the left has run circles around the right for the past 50+ years.,mythic_dot_rar,2025-05-08T12:58:36,-61

"Last I knew, textbooks get changed all the time. Average is every 3-4 years and updating for some textbooks happens yearly depending on the subject.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T15:49:13,16
If you can restrain yourself from making assumptions and clarify what you mean about the left running circles... maybe we can have a polite discussion.  Otherwise you are not making and sense.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T15:50:44,35
Dictionaries too.  Meanings of words have to change to fit narratives.,Buschwick66,2025-05-08T16:44:17,-1
"The Left understands that politics is about more than just pieces of legislation, like dictating the language we use to describe things.   Instead of simply calling out their attempts to control the language, which is only a defensive tactic, we should be playing offense, and capturing or recapturing language.   Politics is inherently metaphysical. Conceding those domains to them means allowing them to impose the frameworks in which we have substantive, policy debate.",mythic_dot_rar,2025-05-09T09:52:36,2
"Yeah I remember when they changed, I think it was fascist, to mean right leaning.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T17:02:16,2
"""Vaccine"" had to be changed too.  No longer does a ""vaccine"" work without requiring boosters every month.  [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/30/fact-check-merriam-webster-changed-vaccine-definition-accuracy/6354415001/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/30/fact-check-merriam-webster-changed-vaccine-definition-accuracy/6354415001/)     ""Merriam-Webster adds definitions and evolves existing ones to accurately report on how words are used"" is literally a quote from a MW rep in that article.     So if enough people call conservatives ""fascists""....his logic will be applied to that definition as well.  Truly Orwellian shit.",Buschwick66,2025-05-08T17:42:50,-1
"Beyond a doubt Orwellian.  Sad thing is, 1984 and Animal Farm were Sci-Fi/Fantasy that was Orwell's way of letting the world know what the Soviet Union was doing.  Which means, what the Democrats are trying to do.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-08T18:03:25,-7
