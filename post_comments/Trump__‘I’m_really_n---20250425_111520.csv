Trump's a childish idiot who is also full of s\*\*t.  Canada is not for sale and is a sovereign nation.  Donald Trump has proven himself numerous times that he is a disgrace to America and the whole world and the worst president in the entire history of the United States Of America.,Apprehensive_Idea758,2025-04-25T11:25:55,45

"So he was just kidding when he talked about ending the war in Ukraine on day 1, but he's totes serious about annexing Canada.  How does anyone trust anything this man says?",snoopyh42,2025-04-25T13:55:12,3
"Every time Trump opens his porcine mouth about Canada as the ""51st state"", the Liberal Party picks up a few more votes.   Prime Minister Carney is probably hoping Trump blathers on about this up to poll closing time on Monday.   Trump's 100 days rally in Michigan is being held the day after Canada's election. Macomb County is on Lake St. Clair which forms part of the border between Michigan and Ontario. So pre-rally publicity for the event will reach a peak on Election Day as voters in nearby Sarnia and Windsor are making their way to the polls.   Donald Trump single-handedly rescued the Liberal Party from a likely defeat and is now gifting it with a probable strong majority in Parliament.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-25T15:07:29,3
"Hmmm.... ""We don't need shit from them, we can make this stuff ourselves.  But we pay for their military, so it makes sense if they were the 51st State.""  Or, something like that.    First of all, why the entire country as a single State?    Second of all, this would introduce 10s of millions of 'new' liberals into the U.S., so maybe it would be a good thing?",crucial_geek,2025-04-25T11:42:32,6

My favorite part of the Trump story lifecycle is when the 'he's just making a joke to own the libs' crowd has to pivot when he inevitably tweets 'I'm not joking',Mr_Shakes,2025-04-25T16:29:00,2

Canada should look into submarine based nuclear deterrence. ( I have no doubt the Canadians have it in them),Matthmaroo,2025-04-25T16:21:36,1
"Yes. If you see his posts on truth social or whatever platform he uses, you can hear all his projections just pouring out. He actually “talks” about other people, but really it’s the foul side of him, exposing himself.",mlineras,2025-04-25T11:30:15,26

"He should be removed from office just for this. He's nuts. He's unfit for office, just like the entire criminal enterprise pretending to be a ""working"" government.

">Second of all, this would introduce 10s of millions of 'new' liberals into the U.S., so maybe it would be a good thing?   In the dark timeline where the US invaded Canada, almost certainly the Trump consolidation of power would be so complete that any election considerations are irrelevant.",hansn,2025-04-25T11:51:37,4

There are about 20 per cent ish of Canadians that like this idea. Via a poll in Feb. I’m sure once they realized what this really meant for us it would drop to 10 per cent. They think it’s a great idea because they are dumb and do not understand the US is going fascist.   We have also gotten to the point of calling these people traitors. So they aren’t socially vocal about it.  MAGA has become traitors here since the whole annexation crap started. They exist but they aren’t as vocal. There is a reason our liberals will likely win this next election and it’s because our conservative tied himself with MAGA.   Most Canadians loath Trump.,HistorianNew8030,2025-04-25T13:17:29,6

"Elections will only cease if people allow it to happen.    The U.S. is not going to invade Canada.  Trump is kinda wussy, so is Vance, and Hegseth is on his way out.  The DoD probably most likely would not agree to it, in part, because it would mean going to war with all of NATO.",crucial_geek,2025-04-25T12:43:27,3
"I am not suggesting it happen.  Just pointing out how this is another one of Trump's not-so-well-thought-out ideas.  I can't remember who said it, but some Republican quipped not that long ago that if Canada were to become the 51st State then Congress would become controlled by Dems, Progressives, etc. from that point on out and the U.S. would shift a little more to the left.",crucial_geek,2025-04-25T12:37:52,1

">Elections will only cease if people allow it to happen.   To be clear, North Korea has elections. Merely having elections isn't the same as having a democracy.   If the Supreme Court rules that Trump's EO on elections is valid, and effectively the only way to show citizenship is a passport. And if they take advantage of the fact the State Department can withdraw or cancel passports on the request of law enforcement or the IRS, they can effectively control who can vote.   Similarly, if they freeze Actblue funds, sue news outlets for interviewing Democrats, or any number of other schemes, they can effectively hinder Democratic opponents.",hansn,2025-04-25T12:56:36,3
