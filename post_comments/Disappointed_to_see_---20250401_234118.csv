"Disappointed???  They significantly moved the needle!   Today was a good day.  The Supreme Court in Wisconsin was saved.  Honestly, probably the most important race today.   There are other local and state races to support and win this year.    Midterms are only 18 months away.   Besides complaining on Reddit, what are you doing?",GroovyYaYa,2025-04-02T01:00:41,148
Took 30+ point deficits down to about 15 points… you’d expect lower GOP turnout without Trump on the ticket regardless but that’s pretty encouraging for just 2 deep red districts,YurtMcnurty,2025-04-02T00:10:54,103
"At the end of the day it's florida, and those seats wasn't changing absolutely no dem expected them to win outright, but the gop definitely underperformed compared to trumps margin of victory there so that's a plus, besides the Wisconsin victory is the real story",FickleSystem,2025-04-02T00:07:36,89
"Lol. FL-1 shifted 8% towards the Democrats and FL-6 shifted 10% towards the Democrats, and somehow you think this is disappointing? In an R+19 and an R+14 district?  **FL-1 (Cook PVI = R+19):**  2024: Gaetz (R)=66%; Valimont (D)=34%  2025: Patronis (R)=56.9%; Valimont (D) = 42.3%  **Fl-6 (Cook PVI = R+14):**  2024: Waltz (R) = 66.53%; Stockton (D) = 33.46%  2025: Fine (R)=56.7%; Well (D) = 42.7%  Oh, let's not forget this race:  **Wisconsin (Cook PVI = R+2):**  2024: Trump (R) = 49.60%, Harris (D) = 48.74%  2025: Crawford (Jurist) = 55.0%; Schimel (Muskovite) = 45.0%  A distinct shift away from the Republicans despite all the money Musk spent in WI.  Let's look at turnout:  **FL-1 (Cook PVI = R+19):**  2024: R=274.0K, D=140.9K  2025: R=97.3K, D=72.3K  **Fl-6 (Cook PVI = R+14):**  2024: R=284.4K, D=143.1K  2025: R=110.7K, D=83.5K  Turnout is expected to be lower for a special election. In this case, in both districts, Republican turnout dropped more than Democratic turnout.",mlawus,2025-04-02T01:51:42,38
"You cannot expect a district that voted for Trump +30 to flip Democrat after just voting for him 5 months ago but cutting that deficit by almost 15 points is huge. People are starting to wake up. The problem with that area of Florida is it has a pretty large Cuban population so when you start calling a candidate a socialist, they all freak the hell out. Once people's SS checks start getting smaller they will start to wake up. Florida is a tough state to win for democrats / liberals. The demographic has changed significantly over the last 20 years.",WritingontheWa11s,2025-04-02T06:54:40,20

Florida has become redder and redder. The battleground days of the early 2000s are over. A lot of conservatives from blue states have moved there over the past few years. I’m disappointed in these results but not surprised.,kerryfinchelhillary,2025-04-02T06:11:54,11

"It is disappointing. I don’t care how many say we moved a needle significantly or not. The reality is that with what’s going on and the vile nature of the “leader” in chief, politics aside, any sane population would vote 80-20 for the best for all.  This just shows you how demented, vile, full of hatred and self centered half of the population of the US is.  There’s nothing positive or optimistic about it.  I already gave up on this country. Luckily I have 2 passports",llcoolm21,2025-04-02T06:53:02,4
"Although this will give House Republicans two more yes votes, the advantage here is a slim margin to still pass simple majority if two House Republicans defect on a vote. In other words, it’s not going to change much.    The reality is that without a supermajority, in particular in the Senate, nothing has changed as far as Congress goes.  No major legislation will pass without bipartisan support.   Despite the loss, margins matter and the GOP is worried. ",crucial_geek,2025-04-02T07:48:52,1

There were bigger shifts (sometimes) in Trump’s first term. Conor Lamb’s first win was about a 20-point shift. And just last week we won the Pennsylvania Senate 36th in a 15-point shift.  Every race is different. I’m not saying we should’ve won these in Florida. It’s been less than 5 months since the general election.,ttltaway,2025-04-02T06:27:03,5
"Yeah. Neat. I remain unconvinced and don't see this as anything other than one side was more lazy than the other. Come the midterms this could all change and you'll see no difference in the votes from 2024.    I know it gets under people's skin, and it isn't to throw cold water on those wanting change in Florida, but no one should count on Florida or use it as a metric for anything.    I'm happy to be proven wrong, but I know those people. The only thing that MIGHT change their minds is absolute ruin -- and I can't stress that word enough.",Ssshizzzzziit,2025-04-02T07:47:19,0
"I'd argue that the demographic has stayed exactly the same, but the world changed around them. They were always Blue Dog Democrats, teetering on Republican. Unless Democrats want to start acting like Republicans, and taking Republican positions, they won't get those voters back. I personally say fuck'em. Make your arguments, stand your ground on positions and let the voters of Florida eat the consequences of voting for Republicans. If they FINALLY figure it out, then great, but don't hold your breath.    Every Cuban in the state could be staring at deportation back to Cuba tomorrow and they'd still vote Republican today.  Every senior citizen could lose their entire Social Security check and only a few would vote Democrat as a consequence. The workers could have their hourly pay slashed to nothing, and they'd still tell you ""well at least I don't pay sales tax"" and bubble in that R candidate.    As an ex-Floridian, I have no faith in any of them to ever change.",Ssshizzzzziit,2025-04-02T07:58:05,5

"Yes, this! Great App!  Also, send Cory Booker a thank you email - cc your senators (and make it a blanket thank you if they participated by asking him questions... if they didn't, then tell Cory how disappointed that your own Senators aren't standing up to Trump and protecting the balance of powers as set forth in the Constitution)  Members of Congress pay attention to stuff like that.

">There were bigger shifts (sometimes) in Trump’s first term.  Were there bigger shifts in the **first 3 months** of Trump's first term? Everything I've stated is correct, and it's ridiculous to call these elections a disappointment as the OP did. So, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  >And just last week we won the Pennsylvania Senate 36th in a 15-point shift.  Great, this just reinforces my point that these races weren't a disappointment. They're in line with a trend that seems to be forming.  I have no idea what Lamb has to do with anything or what you want to say about him. Murphy had run unopposed in the previous 2 elections. Plus Lamb won in the midterm, not in a special election held 3 months into the Presidential term. So what conclusions are you expecting us to draw? How is he relevant?  >Every race is different.   Lol. Please state more obvious things.  > I’m not saying we should’ve won these in Florida.   Then what is the point you are trying to make?

"Nope - there is a large military contingent due to McDill AFB / US Central Command in Tampa.  Tampa Bay and surrounding counties tend to be Republicans.  There are also vast areas of rural open land with scattered small communities and these areas tend to be Republican as well.   Anyone I know who are military or ex military are staunch Republicans. Also, for some reason Miami area votes Republican probably due to many Hispanic voters that feel Democrats don’t have religious ideals.   Also many of the seniors still idolize the Regan years and long for a strong man to lead us into prosperity again.  This is just my perspective and take it with a grain of salt.

"And it makes no sense. Most of them cannot afford to live here because we have insanely high property tax, sales tax, and every other tax you can think of.   They under-fund the schools, steal money that is earmarked for social services, and hate anyone who is not a white southern baptist.  You would not believe the amount of people that move to Texas and immediately end up moving back because the people in Texas do not want them here. Especially immigrants who think they are conservative and want to be around other conservatives.  Texas wants to be a white, good ole boy, southern hangout where everyone loves God, Jesus, their mama, hunting/fishing, trucks, and a cold beer on a Friday night. But they are also in church on Sunday, but not past noon, because that is when football is on.
