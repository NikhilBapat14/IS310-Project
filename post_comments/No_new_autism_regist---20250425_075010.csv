"There’s a lot of people out here who don’t understand what health registries can and can’t do. First off, health registries are very important, and are crucial for tracking disease, conditions, prevention, research and development of new treatments. Second, they are not subject to HIPAA, so they are not violations of privacy and do not need your consent. Third, they already exist and you’re likely in one if you or your child/children have any common condition. The CDC has a database registry that monitors specific locations for autism and they’ve been doing so for years. If you live in one of those states and have an autistic child, or you yourself are autistic, you’re/they’re already in that registry.     While I am very much against RFK Jr. being in the position he is in, for the sake of clarity and factual information regarding autism registries. An autism registry is NOT a HIPAA violation. It is also not a “guise” for public health. Registries are legal and very important. They are not created to “target people”. They are created for many important reasons, and we’ve had them for years. HIPAA laws allow health registries to access certain information without explicit consent.   HIPAA does not apply to research health information (RHI) kept only in the researcher's records. HIPAA doesn't apply to aggregated data that doesn't identify individuals. Registries do not identify individuals. Health registries are not subject to HIPAA rules, and therefore, not considered a HIPAA violation, particularly if they are located outside of a covered entity or business associate.   What are non-covered entities?  Entities that are not healthcare providers, health plans, or healthcare clearinghouses, and do not otherwise meet the definition of a business associates. This includes employers, life insurance companies (when not acting as health plans), workers' compensation carriers, many schools and school districts, many state agencies like child protective services, and many law enforcement agencies.  De-identified Health Information is also not subject to HIPAA. This is information that has had all personally identifiable information removed, meeting the HIPAA Privacy Rule's standards for de-identification. There are two methods to achieve de-identification, the Expert Determination Method and the Safe Harbor Method.  Employment records held by a covered entity in its role as an employer are exempt from HIPAA. This includes employment-related information that the covered entity maintains in its human resources department.  Educational records are covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and are exempt from HIPAA. This includes educational records like grades and transcripts that are directly related to a student, and maintained by an educational institution or party acting on its behalf.  We use health registries for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disease, cardiac disease, Alzheimer’s, neurological conditions, asthma, diabetes, and many other conditions. HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) permits the disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) to public health authorities for disease prevention and control, tracking, and research. Health registries can collect your information without your permission, but they never publish personal information.  Creating health registries streamlines data that’s already there. They also improve understanding of disease progression and natural history, provide better management of patient care and follow-up, facilitate research and development of new treatments, and identify trends and patterns in disease occurrence and treatment outcomes.  There are multiple registries that have been in existence for years. Those registries include:  Cancer Diabetes  Birth Defects Immunizations Patient Outcomes  Genetic Registries  Quality Metrics Patient Safety Trauma Asthma  Alzheimer’s Parkinson’s  Autoimmune disease Cardiac disease and many more.   Instead of a nationwide autism registry, the CDC uses monitoring location-specific surveillance, so if you live in:  Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Delaware Florida Indiana Maryland Minnesota Missouri New Jersey North Carolina North Dakota Pennsylvania South Carolina Rhode Island Tennessee Utah West Virginia Wisconsin and have an autistic child, they are likely already part of an autism registry. Again, registries cannot publish personal information.   There are many things to be upset about with this administration, but this is not one of them. We need registries to improve tracking, public health outcomes, research efforts, and treatment discoveries.   HHS has now said they are not creating an autism registry because they had so much backlash from the public. Whether that is true or not, is debatable. What I have an issue with is HHS trying to access Medicare/Medicaid PHI. This information is NOT exempt from HIPAA and absolutely does require consent.   The problem here isn’t autism registries. The problem is that this administration cannot be trusted to carry out ethical, legal, and evidence-based measures. So far, this administration hasn’t shown that they follow evidence-based science and research. It has spread disinformation about autism and vaccines, amongst other medical disinformation, so I don’t have much faith in anything they’re trying to do in regard to public health. I just wanted to let everybody know that an autism registry, or any health registry for that matter, is not a HIPAA violation, and not a bad thing. Hope this helps you to better understand. ",Flat_Horror9390,2025-04-25T13:07:19,0

I'm not so much concerned with the registry part in and of itself, for reasons you've touched on, but the possible intentions with which this current Administration endeavours to create them. RFK Jr himself has in the past proposed building 'wellness farms', where neurodivergent people would do manual labour, allegedly to treat their autism/ADHD/etc.   From what I read of the actual quotes, it seemed it'd be offered as a voluntary option (and if that's the case, whatever -- albeit obviously ineffective, since that's not how neurodivergence works lmao), but considering all the crazy shit going on with ICE, renditions of people to foreign concentration camps (per the technical definition, from the US perspective), wanting to casually annex country after country, there are a lot of people in neurodivergent communities worrying if these 'wellness farms' would truly be voluntary or not.  Now, hopefully, this is all just for nothing more than an attempt to compile excuses to squawk about the eViLs of vaccines. As harmful as that'd obviously be, that'd be better than the worst case scenarios I'm noticing people freaking out about -- and with how unhinged the Administration has been so far, I can't entirely blame them.",LAM_xo,2025-04-25T16:05:35,4
