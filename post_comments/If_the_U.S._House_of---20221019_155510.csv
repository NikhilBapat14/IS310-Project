"It would be much harder. One reason that gerrymandering is so effective is that instead of just creating new districts when the population demands it, we ""reshuffle"" districts which involves moving around voters to different districts. If we just added districts as needed based on population growth, there's much less wholesale redrawing of lines and more marginal shifts as states grow and shrink.   We might see some initial gerrymandering the first time we move from 8 seats to 13 or 14, but even then, it's a lot harder to get creative with the borders when your districts are smaller. If you've got fewer folks you're representing, it's harder to draw really confusing or complicated lines that are still somewhat compact.",mormagils,2022-10-24T09:22:44,2
"The easiest way to answer this question is to look at the extremes.  If you had one seat per state, then gerrymandering is obviously impossible. Likewise, if you had a number of seats equal to the number of voters, gerrymandering would be impossible.  Since gerrymandering is clearly possible between those two extremes, there must exist some 'sweet spot' of maximum gerrymandering in the middle somewhere.  However, that 'sweet spot' is likely to depend on details specific to each state. So your question isn't really possible to answer in general. It might become easier or harder, depending on the particular state.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-28T16:43:17,2
"This was actually the original system in Congress.  Everytime State experienced a population increase of X number of citizens, they'd get an additional representative.  The limit of 435 was finally set in stone, and the number of people each representative represented was re-apportioned after that the each census.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-12-29T16:30:25,1
