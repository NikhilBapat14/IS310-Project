"Non paywalled gift link. Excerpt:  > WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.—President Trump is minimizing concerns over further economic turmoil as he moves forward with trade negotiations and steps up pressure on Congress to pass a tax-and-spending bill.  > In the coming week, the White House aims to announce at least one deal with a country seeking to escape higher tariffs, according to a senior administration official. Trump in return is seeking an array of benefits, including agreements that trading partners purchase more U.S. goods and curb non-tariff barriers.  > The president and his advisers are feeling somewhat more confident about the economy, this person said, amid some signs of resiliency, including a streak of stock-market gains and a better-than-anticipated jobs report on Friday.  > In an interview that aired Sunday, Trump described the country as in a transition period and left open the possibility of an economic downturn. “Anything can happen,” Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” when asked if a recession could happen. Still, he emphasized that he believes his policies will trigger a historic boom. He described the economy as “partially” his and no longer that of his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying “the good parts” are his.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-05-04T23:00:01,2

A friend is a to the bone Trumper and he runs a pool building business. PLEASE tell me the tariffs will hurt him like it does is many others.,Passionpet,2025-05-05T05:21:49,1
What people are failing to mention is that they can pass all these Tariffs through Congress. Democrats can’t filibuster a Budget Reconciliation bill that I know they are working on. Put the tariffs in the bill if you want them so bad.,Done327,2025-05-04T23:09:05,1
