"Meeting his demands will not stop the bully.  Harvard understands this.  Use the courts, obstruct, delay, survive until better days.  There really isn't another choice to be made here.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-05T20:41:49,25

"Somewhere tonight, Harvard's attorneys are toasting their upcoming billable hours while some low level government lawyer is chugging pepto, dreading the baseless argument they are going to have to make soon.",travio,2025-05-05T20:44:13,13

"Universities, journalists, law firms, corporations, etc need to understand that continual appeasement will never work with Trump who has no qualms betraying them anyway. Banding together they can effectively resist tyranny and those who defect need to be branded forever in future history books as the enemies of democracy.",JohnnySack45,2025-05-05T21:01:10,9
"In the meantime as this and other attacks on academia , along with rising social and economic dysfunction , will prompt the flight of researchers to other nations in a brain drain.   The massive advantages of scientific research capacity built up after WW2 will be squandered and is unlikely be to be recovered as the US falls into a state of  book burning anti-intellectualism.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-05T20:54:12,4
"Harvard needs to get it's shit together, reach out to other universities, and they all need to cancel their athletics programs (which are mostly unprofitable) until Trump fucks off. NO college football, No march madness. Let everybody know it is because of Trump. He will fold.",The-Real-Number-One,2025-05-05T21:19:44,3
"The leash is off of this monster.  Somebody needs to stop him now.  The next time you blink, he's going to claim he has control over the funding for the courts and Congress themselves!  OH GUESS WHAT!  Here's the first attempt to take complete control of funding for the courts.   https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-allies-sue-john-roberts-to-give-white-house-control-of-court-system",the_nothing-,2025-05-05T21:32:00,4

"The problem is how many researchers, scientists, scholars, academics, and professors we lose in the meantime. Brain drain is real, and 2-3 years is quite enough to lose some talent. The US was already neck-to-neck with China in research, but it looks like we're now completely conceding the lead we had for most of the past few decades.",Purusha120,2025-05-06T00:42:38,5
