"I don’t think Trump could have won before 2008. The extent of the complete collapse of the Republican party base wasn’t evident until well into Obama’s administration. His views on foreign conflicts and free trade alone were disqualifying to the establishments of both parties at the time. I do think, however, that there has always been an element of Trumpism within the Republican Party base, but it didn’t become obvious until 2016.",LomentMomentum,2025-04-17T06:00:15,357
"Would Trump have won in 2000, 1988, or 2008 with the same campaign, message, and behavior? Honestly, probably not. The Republican base wasn’t quite there yet, and the party elites definitely weren’t. Back then, the GOP was still riding on Reagan-era optimism, Bush-style neoconservatism, and pro-trade, pro-immigration donor class politics.  In 1988, Trump’s America First rhetoric would've clashed hard with Cold War-era globalism. In 2000, the party was still pushing ""compassionate conservatism"" and free trade. In 2008, post-9/11 foreign policy and the financial collapse dominated, and McCain’s war-hero persona made Trump's style a non-starter.  But here’s the thing: Trumpism was always there — just under the surface.  Working-class conservatives, especially in the Rust Belt and rural areas, were skeptical of trade deals, fed up with immigration promises that went nowhere, and tired of watching D.C. ignore them while both parties catered to donors and global interests. Trump didn’t invent those ideas — he just said them out loud, without apologizing, and without trying to sound “presidential.”  Before Trump, the base didn’t have a real option that spoke their language. So yeah, a lot of Republicans probably were settling for candidates that didn't truly reflect their views — but they were told those were the only “electable” choices.  Why did moderates keep winning primaries? Because pre-2016, the GOP establishment still had tight control: money, media access, endorsements. Plus, without social media, outsider candidates had way fewer ways to build momentum. The frustration was there, but the timing wasn’t right — yet.  By 2016, the stars aligned: people were sick of endless wars, the middle class was hollowed out, the working class was ignored, and faith in institutions had cratered. Trump said what others wouldn’t, and he did it in a way that felt real, even if it was messy.  He didn’t change the GOP — he revealed what a big chunk of the base actually wanted all along.",MrBackBreaker586,2025-04-17T05:34:58,130
"No, I don't think so. I think the combination of social media plus growing religious extremism on the right are some of the factors that were key to his victories. We have Indian Christian family members who are dark skinned and have never lived in the US but support Trump because they say ""he reads the Bible"".",Aetius3,2025-04-17T06:37:33,44
"I think Trump’s popularity is more about his charisma than his policies - a charisma that is baffling to his opponents but very strong for his supporters. He would never have run against Obama because he would have lost against a more charismatic, uniting Democrat.  It was also a reaction against Obama that resonated with a lot of people on the right. But ultimately, charisma is what I think people vote on over policy. The right never had a charismatic answer to Obama and since then the left has never had a charismatic answer to Trump.",BaldingMonk,2025-04-17T09:22:05,12
"No. Trumpism is a direct reaction to multiple facets of Obama era politics.  First, the obvious, it’s a reaction to his race. The worst elements and dregs of society flocked to Trump because of his racist rhetoric. It’s been sanitized so many times now it’s unbelievable but it is openly and obviously racist and there’s a reason the racists like Trump. A black president was too much for their little brains.  Second, false promises. Obama ran a very progressive campaign. He promised hope and change. Those were the literal slogan words of the campaign. He did not deliver on those promises. A lot of people thought he’d make the rich pay for 2008 - he bailed them out with no slap on the wrist. The working class people that voted for him were left devastated with no aid and the people that caused it didn’t get punished. This was huge. Then Obamacare was a complex mess - I think it is overall transformative and good, but it wasn’t what was promised (I know republican interference is largely to blame). It made it very easy to point at and say - “you’re being taxed for other people’s healthcare that you don’t even use”. Given the already existing economic devastation, this was a winning argument hence 2010/2014/2016.  Finally, there’s the elitism issue. Democrats have one, and it’s very obvious. I’m not saying I don’t think siding with experts and educated people is bad or wrong. But the open corporate nature of the party today is incredibly obvious. Every nominee feels like they’re lying - they plaster big smiles and then take billions from rich donors. Republicans do this too, but they don’t present that way. Democrats do. Republicans try to present like the every man tough guy and while many of us see right through that, most lay working class people are just listening to people at face value. At face value, the democrats drop numbers and statistics and complex explanations of how their policies are better while looking and feeling like insurance salesman. Republicans say big bold unrealistic and evil things simply and loudly while looking like insurance salesman and talking like the guy you see at a bar.  In short - Obama created Trump. No Obama era, no Trump era.",NoOnesKing,2025-04-17T10:48:02,8
"He did have somewhat of a campaign in 00 under the Reform Party. He had single digits, chose not to formally run, iirc. In 88, he lobbied to be H.W.'s VP candidate and was rejected - seemingly out of hand.  It's worth noting that Trumps vision is essentially a modern reskin of Pat Buchanan - who was consistently ~20 % in all previous presidential runs in a major party primary.",InsideAardvark1114,2025-04-17T06:02:45,7
"The tea party transformed the Republican party into a much more hysterical, conspiratorial bunch. I vividly remember having Republican friends legitimately tell me they thought Obama was born in Kenya. Glenn Beck's ramblings about him being a communist infiltrator destroying America resonated a lot with people that hated Obama's guts. Trump came in at the right time. I don't think Trump beats Obama or anyone else prior to 2012 though.",kittysloth,2025-04-17T06:25:19,14
People forget that he ran or wanted to run during these years.  Oh and he would not have won for the same reasons why Pat Buchanan didn't win.

"I actually just read this book: When the clock broke: Con men, conspiracists, and how America cracked up in the early 1990s by [John Ganz](https://search.icpl.org/Author/Home?author=John+Ganz%2C+1985-&)     Somebody did run a Trump style campaign back then, his name was Pat Buchanan.  He got 23% of the vote in New Hampshire in 1992, which exposed George HW Bush's weakness and likely encouraged Ross Perot's entry as a third party candidate.  In 1996 Pat ran again and beat Bob Dole in NH by 3,000 votes, and also won AK, MO, and LA, with a close 2nd place in Iowa.  However, he was wiped out on Super Tuesday and dropped out.      In 2000 he ran again as the nominee for Ross Perot's Reform Party, where he got .4% of the popular vote.  However, some of those votes came from liberal Palm Beach county, where the confusing ""butterfly ballot"" earned him 2,000 votes that likely were meant for Al Gore.  Florida ended up going for Bush by 537 votes.       So yes, somebody did try that anti-immigrant, America First populism back then.  Pat Buchanan was a lot more anti-gay than Trump and probably not as likable or charismatic, so maybe Trump would have done better back then?",Toadsrule84,2025-04-17T08:35:54,3
"No, not at all.  I was watching commentary on CNN videos and the overall american public is 55% supports deporting all 11 million illegal migrants,  and they were comparing that to 26%  I think 8 years prior.   Biden's border policies, has dramatically shifted public sentiment.      I think enough people know many migrants got free cell phones, housing, food, transportation, spending cash in some cases.

"I don’t think he would succeed. It was a different world back before the internet and social media. He wouldn’t have been taken seriously.   All this extremist, right-wing conspiratorial politics was not mainstream 20 years ago. It didn’t start going mainstream until the internet and social media came along. The Tea Party movement kicked off this extremist movement but social media got the misinformation rolling and by the time Trump came along, it was fertile ground for his kind of rhetoric and lies. Republicans and conservatives could now get brainwashed through echo chambers via internet algorithms, social media, podcasts, and selective streaming.

"There's too many variables here. He was a household name already, the introduction of and progressive de-volution of Fox and increase in popularity of fringe media outlets, social media, Internet availability/usage/competence.  Woodward/Bernstein in a documentary well before Trump was elected said about Watergate (I think it was included in some extras with All the President's Men) that if Nixon had did what he did in the age of the Internet that Watergate never would have happened, or something to that effect.

"No.  Unfortunately, I think the US wasn't ready for the significant changes the recent progressives were fighting for (that have become significantly more in-your-face and 'radical' within the last 15 years), and they didn't champion those causes in a way that would be palatable to those who weren't yet on board, especially since the left wingers didn't present themselves as proposing many realistic economic solutions.

"I'll get into this by kind of analyzing why he ran in 2016  In 2000, he actually ran a *very brief*, very left leaning campaign. His position was to eliminate the national deficit and universal healthcare, and he qualified for 2 primaries. However, at the time he was accused of running to bolster his brand image. which seems to be true to me at least  So in 2016, he runs again as a Republican, mostly for the same reasons. However his one main position he takes is he doesn't like ""political correctness"" and he feels they need to be ""tough on the border"" and have a ""anti terrorist travel ban"" which targeted Muslim countries  You know what's important to note here? His brazen style, off the cuff remarks that lacked the ""political correctness"" is what got him to win, *not* his actual policy.   *HE WAS THE FIRST CANIDATE TO MASTER SOCIAL MEDIA AND NEWS BY JUST STIRRING CONTROVERSY*  He didn't win on policy, he won on optics. That's the part that nobody realizes to this day  2020 and 2024 are vastly different beasts- 2020 he's the incumbent during a global pandemic he's failing to manage well, 2024 his predecessor isn't doing too well bc wages are stagnant and inflation immediately following covid was very high. 2020 was a recipe to lose, 2024 was a recipe to win...  *because he doesn't campaign on policy*",that_husk_buster,2025-04-18T00:46:58,2

"he probably couldn't have effectively made it such a big issue because there wasn't as much of a divide between the parties on illegal immigration at that time. clinton and obama for instance both supported building physical barriers  at the border to keep  illegal immigrants out.   part of what made his message so successful in 2016/2024 was how over time democrats have become so vehemently opposed to any kind of border control which made ""we're going to build a wall, and we're only going to let in people that come the right way"" so a visible policy divide.",reaper527,2025-04-20T09:04:23,2

"America is an extremely racist country. It never went away but sort of just existed below the surface because wealthy whites felt comfortable that the status quo was safely secured by systemic inequities that kept minorities out of true positions of power. Right wing propagandist media confined the racism to dog whistles and subtly positioning blacks and migrants as a boogey man to be blamed for all of poor white people's problems. They focused on creating all kinds of culture war issues to sow division for decades, but when Obama was elected the dormant volcano of racism erupted setting the stage for a fire brand like trump to leverage those decades of racial tension to grift his way to the presidency.   Social media definitely played a role in creating the perfect storm that enabled trump, and I don't think those algorithms were as precise or easy to weaponize before 2014 or so. I don't think trump gets past the primaries in any earlier elections because he wouldn't have had 8 years of Obama to position himself as the ultimate white savior by claiming Obama wasn't born in America and all that stuff.   Racism + unifying anger over black president + social media/disinformation = trump elected.

"Democrats want to fall in love. Republicans just fall in line.  I think the latter captures it pretty succinctly. All of this goes back to Reagan's defense of Nixon and his whole 11th Commandment (which Trump himself doesn't seem inclined to follow).    I think we're learning that perhaps the politics don't matter so much and perhaps never did.     GOP has seemingly always wanted to drown the government in the proverbial bathtub while simultaneously trying to bend it to its will to its own benefit and infringe on our personal liberties.   I think this is more the natural conclusion to it. We have been heading down this path for years as the intellectualism in the party continued to fall by the wayside in order to capture the blue collar voters from the Democrats.     The Southern Strategy, Pat Buchanan’s culture wars, the Tea Party, and eventually Trumpism all marked stages in the GOP’s move from think-tank conservatism to grievance-fueled populism.    That said I'm not sure Trump could have captured the genie in the bottle prior to presenting himself as some genius boss man on The Apprentice.  The Apprentice was the myth-making machine. Prior to that he might have been more cast in the same light as a fringe candidate like Ross Perot.

Speaking of polarization I think it all started with social medias, so before 2010s Trump wouldn't really stand a chance. Another thing that caused polarization was 9/11 (not immediately but years after) and before Trump's campaign would've been seen as radical.    I don't say that US citizens didn't have their differences back then but recently radicalisation is growing faster than ever before.",Casimil,2025-04-17T07:36:21,1

Trump couldn't have won because he wasn't willing to wear that veil, which means he wouldn't have been able to cut through all the internal party politics.

But today, thanks to social media, podcasts, youtube etc, he can take his zany bullshit directly to conservative voters and say the quiet parts out loud.

And the success of such candidates was generally limited to the South.  The issue that Trump would have had in 1988, 2000 or 2008 was the dominance of the GOP establishment in leading the party.  Goldwater had stymied them by winning the nomination in 1964, but the establishment was otherwise firmly in the driver seat until Trump evaded them in 2016.  Republicans liked boasting at the beginning of the 2016 primary that they had a ""deep bench.""  But what that really meant is that they were so fragmented that the GOP establishment could not keep Trump out of the running.  The party failed to unite around one opponent, which left the party vulnerable to Trump's populism.

"Short answer is no.  Trump would never even win the primaries before 2009.  I blame social media, and I'm not even joking.  One of the negative aspects of a two-party system is that each party tends to pick a side on every issue - and I think that social media greatly amplifies that process.  Take immigration for example...  immigration used to be something that people talked about during an election cycle, but most people didn't actually care unless they were directly affected by it.  They lived in a border state, or they worked in an industry that was directly affected, etc.    Granted, there were folks on TV and radio who'd talk about it - but both sides were usually presented, and both sides tended to at least adhere to a standard.  News was actually news.  With social media, any asshole with a keyboard can reach thousands and potentially millions of people and can say whatever pops into their mind.  Which means, going back the immigration example, you have people who are seeing shit day after day about how immigrants are killing and raping people, stealing and eating pets, taking all the jobs, getting social security and free healthcare, etc.  And there is no filter or check on this stuff.  Anyone can say whatever the hell they want.  There is no filter.  And in recent years, we have bots that are doing the same thing at a much larger scale and can actually tailor their messages to have the greatest impact.  And a lot of news sources, even if they're not putting out complete bullshit, tend to heavily sensationalize and exaggerate things because it's the only way to get any attention.  When people start looking to Facebook and Reddit for their news, the actual news folks get desperate for clicks - and the only way to do that is to sensationalize.  The result is that almost all major issues become highly polarized, and as each party is forced to pick a side, they too become more and more polarized.  Both parties have basically gotten to the point where they ridicule the very notions of compromise and nuance, and even the suggestion of working with the other side can cost you a seat.  Throughout US history, our politics have been on a sort of pendulum.  We go back and forth.  Social media and entertainment news have essentially given that pendulum a massive shove.",Wilbie9000,2025-04-17T09:49:04,1

"Good comment. The book ""When the Clock Broke"" by John Ganz covers the history of this well.

It operated in the background during GWB's two terms, because GWB was fighting a ""holy war"" in the middle east, reacting to 9/11 and operating under cover of patriotic sentiment, and thus could be excused by the base for his pro-immigration and pro-trade policies. But once the Tea Party managed to unite the religious right, the hyper-nationalists, the fiscal hawks, and the anti-liberal doomsayers -- mostly through united hatred of Clinton & Obama & Hillary -- they just needed an avatar who could address their grievances through executive decree, and who could create a new brand for the Republican party, since the old brand wasn't working in elections anymore (e.g. McCain, Romney).

The Cambridge Analytica data was useful for testing the methodology and working out tactics.  They also used the ads to generate donations since each ad contained a button to donate.

Repeat for pretty much any audience definition where you've crafted a specific message.
