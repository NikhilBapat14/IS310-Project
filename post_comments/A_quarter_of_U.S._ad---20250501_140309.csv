"Reposted—since it got removed:  A quarter of U.S. adults see Chinese Americans as a ""threat""; Fewer than half (44%) of Americans strongly agree that Japanese American incarceration was wrong.  This is a step backwards in America. Would not be completely surprised about Yellow Peril 2.0 and internment camps under this Administration.   Also, it’s disheartening as an Asian American to see whenever a prominent Asian/Chinese American speaks on behalf of the US on the trade war, such as Nvidia CEO, Jensen Huang or ScaleAI CEO, Alexandr Wang—there will always be some comments questioning their loyalty and allegiances. I know some families dating back since the Gold Rush—before Trump’s German grandfather ever set foot to the States. The whole birthright citizenship law stemmed from a Chinese American being denied his citizenship. There needs to be greater education on Asian American history.",Adventurous_Ant5428,2025-05-01T14:03:51,23

This is not exclusive to the US... and the CCP is doing nothing to assuage this kind of bigotry against their own people.  In fact in a lot of ways their policies (for example: [Xi claiming that the entire diaspora are citizens of China first](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/3/23/insane-xis-call-for-ethnic-chinese-to-tell-beijings-story-stirs-anger)) are fueling this fear and creating the suspicion.  It is almost as if the CCP wants ex-pats to feel isolated abroad in order to make them more susceptible to doing the party's bidding.,code_archeologist,2025-05-01T14:15:20,3

"It is disturbing and people need to know more about Asian American history. Here in Washington, we had a mandatory Washington State history class and it touched on some of the racial issues, both the Japanese internment which displaced a lot of Washingtonians, and the anti-chinese violence in the 1880s, but not nearly enough.",travio,2025-05-01T14:14:29,9
"> there will always be some comments questioning their loyalty and allegiances.  That's because it is socially acceptable in America to question the loyalty of Asians. Do you think anybody dares to question Jewish-Americans on their loyalty to Israel?   The fault actually lies with the Chinese-American community. They are not willing to boycott, demonstrate, punish, etc. people who question their loyalty to China, unlike Jewish-Americans.",xibeno9261,2025-05-01T15:06:12,-1
