"> No there isnt. Its only in the minds of those who deem they have the right to force their religion on others.  Yes, yes there is. Also, blasphemy doesn't have to be about religion. It  has a huge swath of meanings and context.   As for forcing religion on others, that's not a factor in anything. Something is either morally wrong or right based on the group's in question.  You're the one making it about religion.  > That's why in civilized nations, its a protected right under freedom of religion and freedom of speech.  That's not how freedom of speech works and even if it did, something can still be blasphemed and/or morally wrong.   This isn't an issue about Government or enforcing a series of laws into the equation. Something might be morally wrong but have nothing to do with how Government works, or any freedom works.  > After all, blasphemy is nothing more than a zealot getting upset others didn't follow the rules of their personal fairy tale.  Wrong.  Blasphemy has a very wide scope of actions. Having only a limited concept inside of religious beliefs.  I'm a pagan. Yet! The concept of Trump as the Pope or a Pope is considered blasphemy in my eyes. As the concept of Trump being a Jedi.  Both statements can be true. While one is based in religious beliefs and another just a fan-base.  > Blas·phe·my - the act or offense of speaking sacrilegiously about **God or sacred things;** profane talk:  > Sac·​ri·​lege - 1: A technical and not necessarily intrinsically outrageous violation (such as improper reception of a sacrament) of what is sacred because consecrated to God. 2: **Gross irreverence toward a hallowed person, place, or thing.**  Many are the concepts of faith and belief about different topics.  Even pure Science. Also, I a Bio-Chemist with a background in physics. I know lots and lots of educated people with a such beliefs. Actually, a wide range of beliefs, from religion towards pure math.  Sure, blasphemy can be a zealot. But then anybody can be a zealot about anything, at any time, in any subject.  > Extensively. That's why I understand blasphemy is nothing more than another way to say you want to force others to obey your chosen fantasy.  Just seems you hate religion. At a base surface level. I don't understand any deeper meaning in your words.  Blasphemy isn't about forcing anybody to do anything. If anything, it's an offense towards a group of people. A know aggression towards anger and violence.  Perhaps it's a willing offense, perhaps it's an un-willing offense, but the fact that people want to willing offend others is the beginnings of an attack form.  Also, at least personally, nobody is forcing anybody to do anything. I didn't force Trump to compare himself to a Pope, he did that shit (or endorsed the action by using it himself).  He did it to be ""edgy"", to appeal towards a group by harming another group.  > Correct. And one of those things a moral society deems immoral, is forcing others to obey your religious beliefs, which is what blasphemy claims try to do.  Once again, you're making this about religion. Not sure what religion did, but apparently it has blasphemed your concepts of whatever your morals and beliefs are.  The meaning and ability of the phrase has a much wider scope and scale.  > Nothing screams lack of morality, like trying to hold some one else accountable for what you deem is blasphemy  Oh, but it does.  Harming one group to gain advantage over another group, whilst stroking one's ego, is extremely immoral. Everybody should be held accountable to every single action they take.  Every last choice. Every last action. Every last anything.  > Its just another aspect of the dark ages mentality, used to justify forcing others to obey your fantasy.  That's a personal attack. Please don't.  One, I'm not forcing anybody to do anything. However, I can and will judge everybody's actions based upon what they do. Trump can do as he pleases, except when he makes the choice to harm someone to gain benefit towards himself.  Two, the Dark Ages ended over 500 years ago. Nobody can even begin to understand that morality.  > Punishment for blasphemy violates freedom of religion. Freedom of speech. And basic human morality.  What ""Punishment""? What freedom of religion? What freedom of speech?  If somebody does something, then that something will be viewed upon and the choices measured against whatever morality exists.  That's got nothing to do with freedom of speech or religion, nor does that exempt someone to ""do whatever they feel like"".   That might even get into some legal issues, but we're not gonna go there. It's too much work dig up a huge swath of case law.  > Nope, just the ones who hold the pov they have a right to force their religion on others.  Has little to do with religion.  Everybody has freedom. Freedom to make a choice. That choice will be judged by everybody. At all times. Now, perhaps it does or doesn't apply to legality and what a government should or shouldn't do. But that doesn't matter.  This isn't about government.  You can still do something morally wrong and it not be against the law.  Happens all the time.  > I believe it is blasphemy to have a reddit user name start with ""hono""  Then it's blasphemy for you.  > So am I moral for calling for you to be punished because I claim you committed blasphemy?

Those you deem deserving of having actions taken against them, because they don't obey your personal fantasy   Calling for actions taking against someone for blasphemy is blatantly immoral, and violates freedom of region and freedom of speech. Its very clear you don't support either of these.",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-06T14:21:08,1
"Who said I deem anything? I don't deem anything. However, I will judge actions taken. Just like anybody else would.  Who said anything about forcing others to obey? I'm not forcing anybody to do anything. Everybody has freewill and freedom of choice. However, I'll judge their choices as per my viewpoint. Just like anybody else would.  Who said anything about a personal fairy tale? I've got a wide scope of beliefs and different systems/viewpoints. Some are based in religion, some are based in logic and math, some are based in fandom and different fictions. Which, once again, is normal to have.   Every civilization still judges people bashed upon their actions? Correct? Some don't, but most do. So this every civilized nation bit disagreement thing is iffy.   Especially when it comes to different topics. Like, soccer for example. Or food. Or culture. I'm pretty sure there's many a French chef that believes American food is blasphemy in nature.  Laws have little to do with blasphemy.   People make choices. Those choices are judged. Period. Doesn't mean jail. Doesn't mean illegal. Doesn't mean death.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-06T14:30:18,1
">Who said I deem anything?   You did..when jumped in on the side claiming blasphemy was immoral   Instead of acknowledging its a core protected right under freedom of speech and freedom of religion, as its currently deemed by civilized nations, and ironically, even the UN itself.  Cries about blasphemy are nothing more than temper tantrums of children who can't handle others not obeying them",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-06T14:33:08,1
"I deem my own judgements, but what does that matter. It's got nothing to do legality.  Once again. Freedom of speech and freedom of religion only protect people from the actual government. That's it. It's not a blanket ticket for all actions taken. Nor does it defend those actions.  Even then! There's cases of freedom of speech being tightly controlled by the government and freedom of religion also being slightly less controlled by the government.  Of which, I'm not going into case law about those freedoms.  As those freedoms don't apply towards this subject. Next to 0 involvement.   What does blasphemy have to do with any freedom of speech or religion protections? Trump can commit blasphemy all day (and does), that's got nothing to do with the law.  It's not illegal to commit blasphemy.  I'm not sure what you keep talking about. ""Civilized nations and the UN""? What does that have to do with anything?  You keep bring in the whole Freedom of this and that into this subject, when it's doesn't matter. Easily demonizing protections of others and absolution from causing others harm.  Trump committed blasphemy.   That's just a fact. Doesn't mean it's illegal or against any freedoms. But he did do it and it's going to make people upset. All for his own ego.  Accept the facts.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-06T14:41:13,1
">It's not illegal to commit blasphemy  The debate stated by the claim blasphemy is immoral and deserves punishment   Interesting to see you have to abandon that, to cling to your pov.  >Accept the facts  The facts are clear. The only ones who cry about blasphemy, are those who are enraged because they can't force their personal beliefs on others.",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-06T14:42:42,1
"Immorality and deserves punishment **doesn't equal illegal or broken laws.**  Punishment is also a whole scope of different things. Punishment can mean a loss of voters, sales or belief. Heck, it could even mean ego.  Blasphemy has nothing to do with forcing anything on anybody. It's an offense towards a group of people that hold set series of beliefs.   That's it.  A harm against a group of people to gain something in return. Which is morally, wrong.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-06T14:49:37,0
">Immorality and deserves punishment **doesn't equal illegal or broken laws.**  And?  The debate was blasphemy is immoral   And its not. Because blasphemy is nothing more than someone getting upset you don't follow their religious laws  The correct response to a cry of....  Blasphemy!  Is...   so f'ing what.  An Italian chef screams blasphemy because I break spaghetti.   Does that make it immoral for me to do so?  No, its just me refusing to have someone else's beliefs forced on me  Same goes for EVERY case of a cry of blasphemy   Its not immoral, its me saying I don't have to follow someone elses made up personal beliefs.   That's why blasphemy isn't immoral.   Its simply an impotent cry by someone trying to force their beliefs on you.  A leftover from mankind's dark ages, for the powerful to abuse the weak.  Like the cry of witch was in Salem.",WastelandOutlaw007,2025-05-06T14:53:31,1
