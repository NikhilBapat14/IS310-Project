"It's pretty disgusting how the entire national media is floating a third term as a legitimate option, asking him about it, debating it as if it's legal or normal.  Why is CNN pushing the idea that a third term is an option?",mmhannah,2025-05-05T13:57:12,104
Good thing he's not worried about them. ,PressureOld2375,2025-05-05T13:58:53,9

Stop with these articles about a third term. Stop normalizing the idea!  It cannot be given even an ounce of respect as a possibility.,seanarturo,2025-05-05T18:44:48,4

"give it three years of Trump demanding that they should want him to. They'll inexplicably change their minds.   Regardless, it doesn't matter. The people no longer have an opportunity to choose their president",deekaydubya,2025-05-05T15:52:11,2
Even Dr. Frankenstein doesn’t want monster to terrorize villagers whose survivors might come after him.,rotates-potatoes,2025-05-06T00:03:14,2

"Of course not. Now that they fully tested the boundaries of the constitution and established the fact they can govern with disregard to majority of checks and balances, they want to put actual competent people in place to enact their agendas.",sargonas,2025-05-05T14:42:12,1

That is what's pissing me off here. It's entirely whether his popularity justifies it. Is anyone seriously talking about how it's vigorously illegal for him to run again?   I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.,shoobe01,2025-05-05T14:22:31,46
Just the usual sanewashing.,CopySuspicious6188,2025-05-05T14:51:07,15
Who owns CNN? Oh. Well shit it's almost like wealthy fuckwads love an idiot who will do their bidding whether he knows it or not.  CNN and the rest of corporate media are doing their *actual* job: legitimizing right-wing talking points and thus furthering the destruction of the Constitution and the rule of law. To make money. Because money is all any of them fucking care about.,Gonkar,2025-05-05T15:16:32,6

"Normalization. The fact that they are entertaining the idea via polls and surveys instead of outright saying ""no, he cannot, and if he tries, it's an unconstitutional power grab"" and moving on is how they're pushing it.",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-05T18:40:12,5
Anytime the media reports it without an “unconstitutional” in front of it they are normalizing it,nau5,2025-05-05T14:33:54,8
Law? Never heard of it.,shoobe01,2025-05-05T15:30:05,2
Why blame the media and not the people who are doing it?  You ruined my marriage because you told my wife about my affair. Don’t seem quite right does it.,Agitated-Wishbone259,2025-05-05T14:07:35,-8

No it would be more like if I told your wife about your affair while talking out of both sides of my mouth acting like that's a legitimate thing to do.,mmhannah,2025-05-05T14:12:30,2
"You know that more than one party of people can be in the wrong, yes? Trump and co are obviously deranged and dangerous, but the media legitimized his unconstitutional plans and actions by not accurately describing them as such and instead acting as if it's all very plausible. The media is extremely culpable and is a propaganda machine. If you've ever read 1984, remember how it's the media that pushes the narrative that everything is as it should be. Our media is doing the same- it is complicit.   ""Even Republicans denounce Trump's 3rd term plans"" should be ""Some Republicans denounce Trump's unconstitutional plans for a 3rd term.""",RobonianBattlebot,2025-05-05T16:52:03,1

"The point is that there are some lines that must not even be discussed. In a system that relies on adherence to the law, then merely asking the question ""Are you going to break the law?"" is damaging because it assumes that the answer can be ""Yes.""  Merely asking the question is itself irresponsible.  Another example is, ""Will you follow the judge's orders?"" This question is itself horribly irresponsible because you never even want anyone to think about not following judge's orders. Some things must never even be broached or discussed and brought up for debate.",BJPark,2025-05-05T14:35:27,7
"The reporting should include unbiased facts like a third term is not permitted, is unconstitutional, and is another step towards authoritarianism.",Krash412,2025-05-05T15:19:04,8
