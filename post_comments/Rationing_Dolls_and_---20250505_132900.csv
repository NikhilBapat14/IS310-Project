"My teenager went through a strange phase in middle school where he picked up about a 1000 writing utensils that were dropped on the ground.  It is true that people are wasteful. Step up to our hot black market writing utensil sale when you swing by the neighborhood and can’t afford your rent, or surgery, or car or food.  Nothing as tasty as dolls and pencils.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-05T13:34:39,11
"I absolutely have fantasies about reporters just leaning into the absurdity.  Like when he says this doll stuff about 11 years old, which is pretty sexist and antiquated thinking - that a reporter simply askes him ""why do you hate squishmallows?"" because squishmallows is a fun word; we know he doesn't know what they are, and it would frame him like right wing outlets do with leftists with Jordan like gish galloping rants.   The other thing I fantasize about is someone just asking him in a pretty frank, mob tone, ""You fuckin' serious right now? You know how f'n stupid that sounds? Like are you for fuckin' real?  You know you can't do that right? You're embarrassment.. STFU okay?"" in a Sopranos type ""what are you tawkin about, Donnie?!"" type tone.    Just once - I would like someone to go true 'mafia style rhetoric' on Trump and see how well he reacts or can dish it back.",Brief_Amicus_Curiae,2025-05-05T13:51:22,10
"The fact that he just assumes everyone has an excess of everything, so his tariffs will help people to not buy a much, shows how he simply can't comprehend the lives of most Americans.  For the vast majority of Americans, our financial choices are far more serious than whether to buy our kids 1 doll or 30 dolls.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-05T13:52:59,9
The jokes on Donny Two-Dolls.  I just bought  a pack of pencils that'll last me for years if I don't lose them.,confused_ape,2025-05-05T14:00:43,5

He’s full on insane and when will the Republicans stop enabling him? Probably never because they care more about their own interests than the future of the country.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-05-05T13:39:22,2

"Has no one heard of colored pencils? They are beloved by both kids and grownups for coloring and drawing. They are typically sold in very large sets, with 120 or more colors not at all unusual.",DFEisMe,2025-05-06T15:35:53,1
