"Trump doesnt actually think that. I know he says that, but he's a liar, everything he says is a lie, repeating a lie, that he knows is a lie, that his own people know is a lie, that many of his fans know is a lie, is part of the shtick.  ""The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential, command.""   They need their obviously fake evidence to be accepted, not because it looks real, but because it looks fake and everyone is afraid to say otherwise. They know that if they can get us to say that there are five lights then they can get us to say anything they want.  There will never be a day where he says ""oh well I guess he's not MS13"", there will never be a day that they will bring him back. He is the foot in the door, that if they can just wear us down, make us accept that he is gone forever, that there's nothing we can do about it, that he isn't worth risking our own freedom for, then theyll be able to do this with impunity to anyone they like.   The goal is getting at least most of the nation, the stupid fearful backwards racist and lazy majority of the nation, to accept the first atrocity in ""our"" name.   They don't get what they want if they give people due process, they don't get what they want if the evidence they use to disappear people is indisputable, because what they want isn't the ability to deal with criminals with harsh impunity, their goal is to be able to do that to innocents.

"If by that you mean people should have voted for Jill Stein, then I have a bridge to sell you.  Voting blue no matter who doesn't simply stem from team sports politics, nor do I think it necessarily propogates it.  If you think it does, then you haven't been paying attention to the actual discourse on the left.  We all operate within the system that we exist, and unfortunately, [first past the post voting system](https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo?si=w5NcUx7n-MsDGWHQ) makes the kind of voting you are talking about the quickest route to political suicide.  It's not just a matter of will, but a mathematical structural fact.  The system forces us to make uncomfortable alliances or else fascists win, period.  Most actual leftists despised Harris and Biden.  Their support was not born about of a thoughtless desire to see the blue team win as is common on the right.  It was a pragmatic decision based in harm reduction, not the assumption that Harris was perfect.  While there are definitely some people out there who pushed  vote blue no matter who for team sports reasons, I am not one of them.  Now, I want to see every gerontocrat dem primaried as aggressively as possible because, unfortunately, the Democratic party, unless it is wholly replaced, is the only coalition large enough to stand up to the Republicans.  I respect the idea that we should vote for whoever most closely represents our beliefs, but we need a system that actually incentivizes voting that way. Otherwise, we are just pissing in the wind.  But if you want to piss into the wind and tell yourself it's raining, that's your business.  Fuck the Democrats, we should have a better system that doesn't force me to vote for them, vote for fascists, or throw away my vote.",1nfam0us,2025-04-30T13:32:56,1
