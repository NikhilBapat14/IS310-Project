"I would find some way to reduce the inequality caused by the expense of legal representation.   1. The radical solution is to make legal representation a publicly funded service assigned to individual cases by lottery, within their specializations. So if you, some random schmuck, are accused of murder, you're just as likely to get Johnny Cochran as a big shot like OJ is.   2. The less radical solution is to excuse bar-admitted lawyers from jury duty (since no one wants them on a jury anyway) and require instead that every attorney has to take a random case now and then within their specialties at the public defender payscale, as a form of mandated public service. This would mix up the talent levels of legal representation that the man on the street can access, and supplement the sorely overtaxed public defender system. It would also, I think, break down some of the elitism in law firm culture, which I've seen firsthand and is psychologically and institutionally corrosive.",punninglinguist,2025-03-17T01:01:56,19
"I'm very hesitant to consider any structural changes to the US legal system. I think, while it is far from perfect, it is pretty darn good and does not need a major overhaul. When it comes to what you have suggested, increasing the levels of the judiciary that are tribunal would be a no from me. And I am a strong textualist and reject any move towards greater morality in law.

"Pretty sure Germany got rid of all political appointments to their Judiciary because of their prior experience with a quasi-trump administration back in the 1930's and 40's.. Each court selects new members for the next lower bench - we should do that.   For Tort, we need it to be LOSER PAYS. Trump and his ilk stiff their workers/suppliers by simply refusing to pay knowing the legal fees needed to fight them in court will be beyond the means of those they stiff.  Also when a court decides in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant should be required to pay all the damages awarded into a trust account held for the plaintiff, and some reasonable time limit (30 days?) be set for the defendant to appeal the case and have the verdict reversed before final payment is made to the plaintiff..  We need better liable laws. It should be a lot easier to sue when someone tells lies about you on the internet like Jones did to the slaughtered children and their families.

"One thing the current ""justice"" system gets absolutely wrong is the belief in freewill. There is no scientific evidence we have this thing called freewill. In fact, there is a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Individuals and their individuality are shaped through societal forces long before they become adults (whatever age you think that is). The part of the brain involved in decision making, executive function, and the like is the prefrontal cortex which doesn't finish maturing until around 25 years old.   The point is, our justice system assumes freewill in every case rather than acknowledging the social processes which lead to individual outcomes. A person who has problems with being violent or hyper sexual should be viewed in the same way we view a broken car. To paraphrase Robert Sapolsky, we don't think of a car that crashes into a playground because it's brakes weren't working as evil. We think of it as it is, a broken car. It's brakes need to be fixed. Similarly, those of us who have antisocial behaviors who are a danger to the community need to be ""fixed"" through a process of therapy, psychedelic drug intervention. etc.     And we haven't even mentioned the two-tiered nature of our justice system. If you're rich, you can get away with just about anything. If you're poor, good luck. This is a reflection of the economic system we all live in which equates wealth with virtue. Those who have money must be better people, and those who are poor must be bad people. It really does validate Marx's analysis of the base (economic system) informing everything else in society such as a justice system which is part of the superstructure.",oldassnastymask,2025-03-18T11:54:38,1
"The basic foundations of our criminal justice system are fine. The real problem is we're fine with paying for prisons, but we drastically underfund the courts. We should probably double or triple the number of court rooms so that both civil and criminal cases could be concluded much faster. We also need to fully fund public defenders so that poor defendants get a quality defense. The main systematic problem we really need to address is the plea bargain extortion racket. To some degree having more courts would help with that as well, but we really need serious sentencing reform. A system that holds the threat of a lengthy prison sentence over someone's head if they don't plead guilty to a lesser offense is a broken system.",Searching4Buddha,2025-03-18T22:13:51,1
"Personally I am for direct democracy and I don’t believe the myth of the “independent judiciary” which really just defines a class authorized to rule over people, despite the rulers being guilty of all the same human foibles and compromises as the ruled.   I would rather courts be a venue where popular committees convene for a constitutionally defined process of evidence submitting and fact-finding to support decision making. It would not be limited to criminal justice, but something people participate in regularly to establish what should be believed according to available evidence and how much confidence is warranted.   Judges would only administer the system, issuing warnings and recording any abuse of the process to report to the public, who would presumably consider the results suspect and might seek to hold the perpetrators responsible. Juries would include the entire population of the jurisdiction.   When questions of what is constitutional arise final determination would be made by popular vote, requiring something like 60% of the vote—else a formal constitutional crisis would be triggered and ordinary business suspended until a consensus can be reached.",ResurgentOcelot,2025-03-17T02:59:51,1

"Popular committees would shift 5-20 paid working hours out of 40 to self-governance participation depending on interest and ability. Committees would be self organized by geography and areas of interest. A method of ensuring people don’t ignore some topics like sanitation would be necessary.   Committees would organize voter education, often sharing programs amongst similar committees in different geographies, and fill the primary role of a legislature within their jurisdiction.   When necessary collected committees would nominate and elect experts to attend temporary congresses limited to single topics. These representatives would carry the number of voters they represent to congressional votes. on proposals. Successful proposals would be brought to and ratified by popular committees.   Committees would exert authority only by popular vote; multiple committees on the same topic are welcome to divide the population as able, necessitating compromise for coalition if many committees have large participation.   Committees might absorb some government bureaucratic work, but further discussion on division of government labor is necessary. All of this is only feasible by leveraging modern communication technology.  When topics are discussed it often occurs that facts are in doubt. Committees would trigger court hearings to formalize the presentation of evidence.   This process would apply to civic, civil, and criminal matters; in the latter cases methods of ensuring impartial jury committees would be necessary, but in matters of self governance it is simply a matter of convincing juries of what is true.

However , conservative judges are typically members of The Federalist Society.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Society",JKlerk,2025-03-17T11:39:46,1
You suspect that they were on board with suppressing right wing rhetoric when they donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s campaign?,About137Ninjas,2025-03-17T14:55:02,2
"You realize you just posted a link to a letter that is a) internally contradictory and b) even if you grant credibility to the letter, explicitly states that Facebook/Meta made internal content decisions *on their own*, completely disproving your point, yes?  I ask again, why pretend so transparently?",BitterFuture,2025-03-17T16:57:37,2
>Sounds like the politicization occurs behind closed doors in AUS.  Do you have a sources for your assumption or are you just guessing?  Do you think Swedens courts also politized behind closed doors?  Sounds like cope tbh. It's clear to anyone that the courts in America is highly politized while the rest of the western world seems to be doing awesome in that regards.,Be_Kind_And_Happy,2025-03-17T15:22:52,-1
Who Mark Zuckerberg? He donated in December of 2024....WELL after he testified in front of congress back in February of 2023.  I imagine after being sucked into a conspiracy with one side of the government to suppress news that appeared unfavorable for a presidential candidate during an election cycle....yea....I'd flip sides too to avoid being associated.,Vaulk7,2025-03-17T15:36:56,0

Can't have both more transparency and less politicization,JKlerk,2025-03-18T06:14:49,1
"You can have both. No clue why you don't think that is the case. It's about who appoints what in comparison to the merits of that appointment being publicised, which seems to be the case with Australia.   In any case it's clear that Australia has a superior system then America where the judicial process has been hijacked in order to further political agenda. Something I so far has seen 0 evidence for the case being with Australia.",Be_Kind_And_Happy,2025-03-18T06:49:53,1
