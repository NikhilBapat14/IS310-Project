">""[Harvard coach] Tommy Amaker is a friend of mine. He sent me this shirt, and it felt like a great day to wear it,"" Kerr added. ""I believe in academic freedom. I believe itâ€™s crucial for all of our institutions to be able to handle their own business the way they want to, and they should not be shaken down and told what to teach, what to say, by our government. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard, but it's kind of par for the course right now. This is me supporting Harvard.  ""Way to go, way to stand up to the bully.""  AOL republished the Fox news article. Link is as follows.:  https://www.aol.com/news/steve-kerr-dons-harvard-shirt-204807083.html  PS: Kerr spoke at the Democratic National Convention on August 19, 2024.",newsspotter,2025-04-22T07:25:18,40

"It's really shocking how the government is attempting to manipulate educational institutions through funding, and to be honest, seeing that nearly $10 billion in grants and contracts are at risk really shows the sheer scope of this egregious overreach, Harvard's stand, though difficult, was essential, and it's important that we support institutions defending their academic freedom and resisting such undue interference.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-22T07:42:12,11
Kerrâ€™s parents were both academics and his father was murdered by Islamic Jihaad while serving as president for American University of Beirut. He certainly understands more than most the impacts of authoritarianism and academic suppression.,mdmcnally1213,2025-04-22T10:28:15,9
America loves an actual winner like Steve Kerr.        We don't like these MAGA posers who believe they are entitled to run America in to the ground.,faith_apnea,2025-04-22T11:02:07,3

Fully agree. Even stuff like the Eagles not going after winning the Super Bowl  is something. Instead we get the Dodgers and Buckeyes visiting the White House to give Trump a commerative jersey. Even more disappointing is guys like Mookie Betts who skipped the trip in 2018 with the Red Sox but go now.,GenoThyme,2025-04-22T10:36:39,6
This is so under appreciated. Look how much of a stir the kneeling made. Will be nice when more teams start turning down the White House invitations.,Swordf1sh_,2025-04-22T10:09:46,4

Yup. Thatâ€™s how research happens in almost every single university in the world and thatâ€™s how things are found or created that help us as a society as a whole to progress.,rickee_martin,2025-04-22T15:23:18,10
"If you are counting the Endowment as a part of that revenue those dollars have a specific purpose most of the time. For example, my family created scholarships at Iowa State University and other places and the donations to make those scholarships went into the Endowment Funds. The money made from that portion in the endowment fund can only go for the scholarship. So we donated like $25,000-ish so with a 5% return on the Endowment an revenue of $1,250 comes in and pays for the scholarship for the student.   Also, when doing donations the funds have to go to the specific purpose that the donator wanted when designated. If I gave Iowa State $100,000 to their endowment fund for the creation of another Disc Golf Course the funds after to go to that. We had a donor in my Boy Scout council pull back his $5 Million he donated when it was clear the council was pussy footing around building a new Director's Lodge at the Scout Camp. The $5 Million was for the Director's Lodge and couldn't be used in any other way.",CTeam19,2025-04-22T20:56:46,2
So we should have no problem with Tesla receiving government money and tax breaks right? Same for SpaceX and Blue Origin? Private entities receiving money and tax breaks because their research and innovation is a net positive for society?,Ok_Cockroach_2290,2025-04-22T15:58:51,-3
