71.6% of voters in this state want this.,accountabilitycounts,2025-04-29T09:41:21,48
I said this before and I will say it again to red states:   Stop voting Republican.,misterlakatos,2025-04-29T09:41:57,27
"Really, it's just unbelievable that the administration would cut programs that return $40 for every dollar invested, especially when Wyoming AmeriCorps members tutored and mentored over 2,700 children last year, and you know, I'm really struggling to understand the logic behind slashing funding that clearly benefits so many people, I mean, why would anyone intentionally harm communities and vulnerable populations like this, and the question that keeps running through my head is, given the clear return on investment, why aren't we expanding these programs instead?",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-29T09:48:10,25
They got what they voted for!,nuwildcatfan,2025-04-29T09:40:55,13
cry me a river....  these people voted for it.,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T09:48:49,12
I hope we can mitigate losses of federal protected land during this abysmal administration,ImAMindlessTool,2025-04-29T09:39:58,7
Can’t be having Americans volunteering to help other Americans if there’s a way for someone to make more money.,greenman5252,2025-04-29T09:48:08,7

Wyoming who? Sending some bootstraps,fastcatdog,2025-04-29T19:50:20,2
"Or is it 71.6% of the people who voted in Wyoming, voted for this?",Orwells_Roses,2025-04-29T10:12:39,19
It’s the network of propaganda that gets people to vote like this. I live in Wyoming in low income and the majority think republicans are here to help them. They don’t know what they voted for and that’s the issue.,shelter_king35,2025-04-29T14:57:59,4

Trump was never about investment.  If he was he could have invested his 300 million dollar inheritance in the market and be richer now than he is.  Trump is all about what is in it for him and not any real investment.  See investment means waiting and caring about doing something that lasts.    Not Trump's MO,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T09:49:57,9
"""I'm really struggling to understand the logic behind slashing funding that clearly benefits so many people""  That right there is the reason, it benefits many people and not a few oligarchs.",Alleandros,2025-04-29T10:03:35,6
"How did they vote for it, when none of it was mentioned during the campaign? Trump pulled a bait and switch. Suckers, maybe, but complicit, doubtful.",ShakeyLegsMcGee,2025-04-29T11:16:40,-17

Project 2025 was mentioned.  Trump is not a surprise on anything.,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T11:18:49,19
"*Trump promised to hurt other people... But not me!*  Yeah, they voted for it.",Hyperion1144,2025-04-29T11:54:20,16
"Bullshit.  'I'll be a dictator on day one.'  He said exactly what he was going to do.  Plenty of people told them Project 2025 was coming down the pipeline and these dimwits labeled it fake news.  He made a lot of noise about hurting illegal aliens and trans people, and the MAGAs were fine with it.  Fuck all of them.",InertiasCreep,2025-05-01T00:56:33,1
Correct so that you could rent a place to live and buy groceries in the small impoverished communities where you were volunteering your time.  Rural poverty is a real thing and Americorps volunteers were helping the situation.,greenman5252,2025-04-29T12:24:36,8
