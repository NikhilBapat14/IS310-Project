"This is a decent seizure, especially with the money and guns, but I don't think 11.5 kilos is the biggest of all time, especially compared to some of the seizures that occur on the southern border.   Edit: I'm thinking this article is just poorly written and it's 11.5 kilos of fentanyl powder plus 3 million pills, which would be a couple hundred kilos and definitely one of the bigger fentanyl seizures.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-05-06T14:08:59,101
">Sixteen people including three women, were arrested in the operation. Six of the males are in the U.S. illegally, Bondi said.   America needs to get serious about the penalties for selling drugs like fentanyl. These sixteen people are guilty of attempting to murder Americans.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-06T14:09:25,86

"Supposedly on her desk, where they have been since she started, it's pretty obvious that even though we want to see and know whose on it, and held responsible, there are names on both sides of the aisle and like the JFK files they will be released in 60+ years.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-06T15:22:56,40

"She's taking her time alright, the Epstein file has been on her desk since day one,  and it still is just collecting dust, just like today, why was she needed for a news conference? All she basically did was be a spokes person praising the organisations that actually DID the work. There was no need for her to be there at all, she didn't do a damn thing concerning the big drug bust. Maybe she should have been at her desk going over the file the PUBLIC is asking for. But yes keep making excuses for her, you notice Patel wasn't at the conference today like her, maybe he was actually doing some work.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-06T18:18:17,7
"Did you watch the news conference? If so, you would have seen her praise those who were there, for doing the job they were hired to do, she basically did nothing but make an appearance. But yet the Epstein file has been laying on her desk, those 100 days you speak of, but yet, here we are nothing, one would think the release of names could be finished in a matter of hours, but here we are how many YEARS later. People like you is why nothing is ever accomplished, other than making excuses instead of demanding results.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-06T13:48:57,13
