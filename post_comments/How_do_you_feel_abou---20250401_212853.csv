"This is going to get me flamed, but this is the latest data point supporting the argument that money does not win elections. I mean, you still have to hire staff, put out ads, and get your candidate and their message in front of voters. But the kind of zany crap that Musk is pulling, and the outrageous billions other donors are pumping into campaigns don't seem to be working.  money can buy you politicians, but it can't buy voters.  edit: let me put it another way. its like auto racing. If you have a good team and a good car, you will do better than the racer who has neither. But if you have all that, and a genius driver, you will always win. money can get you the car and the team, but it doesn't always get you the driver. a poor team can have a great driver and still beat a rich team with a bad driver.   Musk dumped his money on a losing team. What's more, everybody SAW him dumping his money on that team, which likely turned out the support for the liberal judge. Either way, he was on the wrong side of that issue and got squashed",PoorMuttski,2025-04-01T21:49:38,30

"Elon made substantial financial contribution, over $20 million to support conservative MAGA candidate Brad Schimel. Organizing a town hall in Green Bay, where he distributed $1 million checks to voters and emphasized that the election outcome was critical for President Donald Trump's agenda and the future of civilization itself.  The election did not go in his favor. Liberal judge Susan Crawford won the race, maintaining the court's 4-3 liberal majority. Now Elon is dealing with the raising questions about the effectiveness and legality of his financial influence. Discussions about the role of wealth in politics and the potential dangers of such significant financial contributions like undermining democratic processes and judicial impartiality.  This win highlights the growing influence of wealthy individuals in political and judicial races. Despite his efforts, the outcome suggests that public sentiment and the democratic process can still override such financial power. GET OUT AND PROTEST!!!

"it kind of worked. Money can buy you a strong campaign structure, which can make the difference in an election. By that, I mean it can pay for door-knockers, phone banks, voter data, and expensive analysts and consultants. That also means it can buy you cheats, assuming that is what Musk was able to do. But that isn't guaranteed to overcome voter [sentiment.You](http://sentiment.You) can get all the celebrity endorsements, guest-spots on talk shows, and advertising you want. if the voters hate you, you should probably just curl up and die.    People around the world voted to oust incumbent governments. Its like this, whoever was in power during the Covid-19 pandemic got booted whenever the next election came along. After the pandemic came a global wave of inflation, and whoever was in power during *that* period *also* got booted in the next election. People were going to kick Trump, one way or the other. But Biden was similarly doomed. No amount of money was going to save either of those guys. Without some drastic actions (actions that safe and sane Biden would never take) the Democrats were destined to lose the White House.  I should probably dig up some statistics to back my argument up, but this is an assertion I have often read from political analysts. It's not a popular argument to make because the general effect of dumping money into any other contest is that the richer guy wins. And it also doesn't account for the less direct ways that money corrupts: buying the support of elected politicians, for instance. Money in politics is bad for people without money.

The great irony of that is the last president elected in Cuba was a social democrat  https://preview.redd.it/f3xa5iegndse1.jpeg?width=792&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=33baa55bd5560fb39519d0bce0eb3296c30f30bb,Impossible_Host2420,2025-04-02T02:51:54,8

Probably not. They are pretty well baked into their thinking at that stage of life. They would probably blame it on Biden.,jtshinn,2025-04-02T09:40:17,2

"It depends on the Catholic. I've known rabidly pro-birth Catholics, rabidly pro-life Catholics (as in against the death penalty and abortion and for social programs to help feed and house people), and rabidly pro-chioce Catholics.¬†   People are people.",Remarkable-Let-750,2025-04-02T11:26:25,2
You're probably right. They'll blame it on whoever Faux tells them to.,BayouGal,2025-04-02T10:09:05,1
Exactly they will somehow blame it on Biden. Even after he dies. It‚Äôs just depressing the brain rot.,Forsaken-Moment-7763,2025-04-02T13:27:44,1
"What‚Äôs comforting is that, in gambling terms, we were playing with house money. The republicans winning don‚Äôt take any seats the dems hold.",CactusSpirit78,2025-04-02T00:56:12,12

She lost but with most of the vote in she flipped a portion of her district near Alabama to blue from red‚Ä¶that‚Äôs good news despite the loss.,HollywoodHills_20,2025-04-01T22:32:37,8
"Exactly.  They'd have probably figured out a way to make it 7-1.  Though, it would be extremely difficult to parse both Milwaukee's and Madison's districts into populations that would have a majority Republican population.",Traditional_Land_553,2025-04-02T16:36:57,1
It's because the American Bishops are more right wing political activists than they are pastors these days and a lot of us stopped going,RellenD,2025-04-02T07:45:44,12
Because it turns out issues are super complex and nuanced but single issue voters can‚Äôt handle that. Plus abortion was never about abortion it was about control. If it‚Äôs about abortion every possible option to stop abortion would have been in the table and used.,sten45,2025-04-02T08:57:46,2

"Honestly, if I had to guess they‚Äôd probably be able to get away with just making Madison and Milwaukee a single district because obviously those areas are gonna vote Democrat no matter what but if they subdivide it into other districts or just merge them into one, it would have certainly made it a seven to one thing",qwerty2234543,2025-04-02T18:16:43,1
