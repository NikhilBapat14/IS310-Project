"It's so strange seeing him tell the truth for once. He truly doesn't know.   Every other person who's been president, even the shitty ones like Buchanan or any given Harrison, was at least *trying* to serve the public interest. A few looked after making a few bucks on the side while on office (LBJ, Poppy Bush) or helping their jiillionaire buddies make some scratch or setting themselves up to become wealthy after being in office; but every one of them spent their time in office doing what they thought was right for America and her position in the world.   Not Trump. He's there just to benefit himself. He uses the office to line his pockets right f'ing now. He's there solely for personal gratification. Everyone compares him to Hitler, but the reality is that Trump is actually a perverse mashup of Benito Mussolini and Imelda Marcos.

"It's pretty damn clear that if a president fails to uphold their oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution, several consequences. This information is available to everyone:  Impeachment and Removal: The most direct constitutional remedy is impeachment by the House of Representatives for ""treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors."" If convicted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate, the president is removed from office and may be barred from holding future office.  Criminal Charges: If the president's actions involve illegal conduct (e.g., bribery, abuse of power), they may face criminal prosecution, though there is ongoing debate about whether a sitting president can be prosecuted while in office.  Public and Congressional Censure: Congress can formally censure or reprimand a president, and public backlash can erode trust and affect future elections.  Legal Penalties: Federal law makes it a crime for officials, including the president, to advocate the overthrow of the government or alter it by unconstitutional means, with penalties including removal, confinement, or fines.  Section 4 of the 25th Amendment: If the president is deemed unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, the vice president and a majority of the cabinet can declare the president unfit, temporarily transferring power to the vice president.

"In Trump’s worldview, he does what’s in his power \*at the moment\*. In other words, if it’s in his power to not write a check to an agency, or not approve an expense, or fire a person, then he’s going to use that power.  In his view, the \*correctness\* of his use of power is up to court to constrain. And if the court doesn’t have a mechanism for enforcing that constraint, then he’s just going to ignore it. In his worldview, it’s up to someone else to enforce the constitution. He does what he does, and it’s up to someone else to tell him when he’s crossed a line.  That’s how he’s always operated. He is not a political animal. He did not grow up in the political schools of thought. In a way, he is quintessential American, in that the rules are for the referees to enforce; he’ll play right up till someone tells him he’s overstepped. And if he gets to choose the referees, then all the better.  American style Democracy is up to the People to enforce. Keep calling him out. Keep suing him. Keep his lawyers flooded with lawsuits they need to defend. Make him the enemy of the entire Judicial branch. Start impeachment proceedings, not against him, but against his enablers. Impeach his secretaries. JFK Jr, for lying to congress during his confirmation. Hegseth for incompetence. Hamstring Trump. The People don’t need Trump taken out of office. Half the country likes him there. But force him to kneel to The People.  The Atlantic had a beautiful article (https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/courts-force-trump-comply/682545/) about the power of the courts over the executive branch. The Judicial branch doesn’t have an army to enforce their rulings. Whatever force they do control is governed by the Executive anyway. But the Judicial branch has rulings which are public and they tear away any cover the Executive branch has from The People. Every time a judge rules against Trump, some fraction of his support is gone. Every time a court ruling fact finds against lies Trump says in his press conferences, some fraction of his support goes missing.

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President. >  > Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives his written declaration that no inability exists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office unless the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive department [sic][note 2][7] or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the issue, assembling within forty-eight hours for that purpose if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty-one days after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress is not in session, within twenty-one days after Congress is required to assemble, determines by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall continue to discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the President shall resume the powers and duties of his office.  The 25th amendment is an incredibly unlikely path to removing this President. It would require the VP and a majority of the cabinet to declare Trump unfit. At which point, Trump could just write a letter to Congress saying he's good. If the VP and the cabinet still feel he's not good they could petition Congress again, at which point 2/3rds of both chambers would need to find him not competent enough to serve.  Impeachment is more likely as it would only require a simple majority in the House to impeach and a 2/3rds majority in the Senate to convict and remove.",mrgreengenes42,2025-05-04T14:50:01,1

"The left would do what they always do. Take forever to do anything, forgive and forget, and then lose ground to them again once people forget how bad things got.  The only way things are going to get better is with an entire citizen tear down and rebuilding. A new more robust constitution and systems that HAVE to be updated frequently to keep fascism and bad actors in check.  We live in an amazing digital age, voting should be a civic duty in the same manner as jury duty. Its mandatory and you get all the unbiased factual info on each candidate as far as votes and policies, hell we could even have an advanced high powered AI that is trained specifically to give summaries and answer basic questions about candidates and policies. Of course it would have to be controlled by the election boards and all the states would have to verify regularly that it produces fair and accurate answers. Oh whats that, its not sugar coating this guy who has consistently been wrapped up in bad politics and optics for 20 years? Good.  News media would also need to have a check on it. It should run the way our lawyers and doctors do. You set up a board with seats, one seat for the government and the other 6-8 seats would go to the established news media. They must hold each other accountable, news much be defined in facts, things like opinion pieces would need like massive surgeon general warnings that they ARE NOT FACTUAL NEWS, and shouldn't be allowed to air at the same time or directly following actual news segments so that people know that they are, in fact, listening to a talking head.  If one network starts to slide into the realm of fantasy or alternative facts any member of the board can call a vote to eject them and have them lose their ability to broadcast 'news'. There would also need to be a mechanism to protect independent news outlets and journalists, while at the same time making sure people are not abusing the system to just become a talking head on a smaller scale with the safeguards of being 'news'.  We'd need to abort the electoral college, its dated and makes no sense anymore. The states are not fucking equal and we shouldn't allow shitholes like Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, etc to hold back the 80% of the country actually propping them up. Any state that takes more money out than they put in should actually abide by the 'my house my rules' and pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they don't like it.  I could go fucking on.

"Here are some legal definitions.  https://dictionary.justia.com/uphold  > 	1	The term refers to a process where a decision or a rule is affirmed and allowed to remain in effect   https://www.legalbriefai.com/legal-terms/uphold  > The term ""uphold"" is often used in legal contexts to indicate that a decision, rule, or law is confirmed and allowed to continue being effective. When a court or authority upholds something, it means they agree with a previous decision and choose to maintain it. This can happen in various situations, such as when a higher court reviews a case and decides that the lower court's ruling was correct. For example, if a judge makes a decision in a trial, and that decision is later reviewed by an appeals court, the appeals court may choose to uphold the original ruling. This means they believe the decision was fair and just, so it remains in place. > Upholding a law or decision is important for maintaining order and consistency in society. When laws are upheld, it helps people understand what is expected of them and what consequences they might face if they break those laws. For instance, if a law is challenged in court, and the court upholds it, that sends a clear message that the law is valid and should be followed. This can help prevent confusion and ensure that everyone is on the same page regarding legal expectations.  https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/uphold  > Uphold means the appellate court agrees with the lower court decision and allows it to stand. See affirmed.",BringOn25A,2025-05-04T10:24:51,5

"If Trump intends to declare martial law just so there won't be anymore elections, there are three reasons to why I'm optimistic he won't succeed.  1. Look what happened when the Korean president attempted martial law.  It failed miserably for him to the point where he's even facing criminal charges.  This could be the one thing that could cause Trump to finally face justice because as bad as J6 was, him declaring martial law would be even worse, especially if he does this solely to cancel elections. 2. Trump has endorsed around 20-30 candidates already for the 2026 elections and I'm sure he'll endorse more.  If Trump tries to cancel the elections, I don't see how the candidates Trump endorsed would be okay with this because you can't endorse candidates only to then turn around and cancel elections by use of martial law.  Besides, why is Trump even endorsing candidates if he wants to declare martial law and abolish the 2026 elections altogether? 3. The military consists of over 2 million folks.  I'm sure at least 95% of those in the military don't want the elections to be canceled as much as the rest of us do.

"Like much in politics today, no one wants to change their mind. Whoever understands what you're saying understood it last October. Biden himself was a strategic anti-Trump pick, and she as VP was further strategery to strengthen the ticket. It worked. But then instead of using those four years to build a fresh winning ticket our ""transitional"" candidate decided to stick it out – and much of the DNC support him fully, until the debate. At this point, not supporting Harris would be seen as admitting she was essentially there in '20 as a demographic vote vs policy maker. Failure was nearly predetermined (though I did actually start hoping toward the last few weeks there that enough of America would vote ""not Trump.)  I'm in the possibly unpopular camp that puts this squarely on Biden for not projecting early that he did the one job he had to do which was defeat Trump in '20, and that DNC needed to get to work at the drawing board. Give Harris her fair shot to prove to the party and nation that she'd become the new leader she was not able to be four years prior. Alternately, the collective chooses whomever they choose and run a hard campaign and see what happens. Sadly I think the timeline in which Trump loses on '24 has yet another old, white guy with a woman VP. We simply aren't there yet.  And with a much sadness I'll say if the DNC runs another woman she will need to be impeccable with a ridiculously higher bar than any male, in order to win against a very certainly male GOP candidate.

Even if you completely ignore projects 2025 absolutely nothing about Trump's platform was even the least bit acceptable. These people weren't lied to, they weren't mislead, they wanted all the terrible stuff Trump offered and are just upset it is affecting them personally now. There are no quick, easy, or painless solutions for our current problem. You don't just forgive and continue a relationship with an abuser without first making them prove that they have changed their behaviors, if you don't it is just as much your fault when you get burned again.",OskaMeijer,2025-05-04T12:44:27,2
"I refuse to tolerate intolerance. You and I are about the same age. I had your optimism pre 2020 when Trump attempted an insurrection. That was further validated when America voted the Insurrectionist back into power. They are not victims of his lies, there were no lies. Everything was laid out on a table, and Republicans decided that was a great platform.",HiImDIZZ,2025-05-04T12:30:59,4
Being intolerant of bigotry is what drove them to trump.  We weren’t even intolerant towards them.  Literally just letting people live their lives was enough to drive them to trump because they don’t want minorities or LGBTQ people to have rights.  That’s what drove them to trump.  Don’t stand side by side with Nazis.  America can do better and should want better.,Supermite,2025-05-04T10:59:48,1
"I have listened, and read, I know all about that and also do not believe he won.  I also remember the George Floyd Uprisings and bodies are bodies. If they regret it they can prove it- I don’t trust them at all beyond that. I’m talking about a real civil uprising.   I don’t think we can even DO that in this mass surveilled police state and it’s truly beyond the capabilities of the masses to do anything that’s necessary to take our country back.",Ammonia13,2025-05-04T10:43:37,2
"Look, I hate Trump as much as anyone here, but he's talking about the 2020 election. He's saying if he'd won in 2020, he'd be gone by now (which is obviously another lie)",yamo25000,2025-05-04T10:45:53,0
"She should have just won, now why isn’t anyone thought of that? Do you realize how ridiculous this is to say? She can’t will herself to win, especially in a year where voters honestly believed the candidate who thought immigrants were eating dogs and cats, who had a “concept of a plan” for healthcare, who told lie after lie, who proposed demonstrably harmful economic policies, was the superior choice to a seasoned leader with concrete policies that weren’t objectively terrible.

"I understand your meaning. I would love for them to turn around and say, ""let's fight trump,"" but I dont think we're there yet. I dont think Republicans that have been voting for Trump the last few elections even remotely trust Democrats.    They have to have enough self awareness and shame to realize their mistakes and admit them. I dont think anyone voting for Trump three times is capable of that kind of emotional intelligence. ",Militantpoet,2025-05-04T10:48:13,2
"I agree with all of that, but I guess I'm looking for something more specific. Are you suggesting we don't impeach Trump so that conservatives who voted for him suffer the consequences of his disastrous policies? That doesn't sound like a good idea. That's cutting off our nose to spite our face imo.",yamo25000,2025-05-04T12:56:07,1
"I will stand side-by-side at a protest with an ex-nazi who says ""I fucked up"". I won't welcome them into my home or my life, but I will gladly protest with them.   To your point - it's cruel intolerance of bigotry that drove them to Trump. I'll be candid - I grew up in a red state and was indoctrinated as a republican at a young age. I used to be anti-gay marriage, anti-trans, etc. Now I am in favor of all of those things and am a democrat, but it isn't because someone told me I was a racist, homophobe, Nazi, etc. It's thanks to people who calmly and respectfully challenged my beliefs, and because I began to associate with people who are gay, trans, or left-leaning.   If Trumpers who regret their vote come to liberal spaces, get exposed to democratic and liberal ideas and values, and are calmly and respectfully taught why their views are harmful, then we may very well flip them to our side.",yamo25000,2025-05-04T11:31:26,0

"No, we should definitely impeach Trump but just like last time there is no path to doing that effectively right now. We have played nice with these people for 30 years and have had the power to really affect progress for almost none of it because of these people. We should not bargain with these people with the off chance they *might* help us get Trump out as it won't work anyway and in the off chance it actually does we are simply buying a very short period of calm before they just go back to getting someone even worse into power. Hell impeaching Trump won't even accomplish much as those that would replace him under the current administration are literally just as bad. Working with these people is also why the Democratic part keeps being center-right and shutting out progressives, as why should the money that supports the Democratic party allow any progressive voices to take any power when we keep feeding the right wing of this country and help create an enemy so bad the Democrats don't have to be that great just to not be as bad as the GOP. Idealists trying to be nice and focusing on unity are putting us into an endless cycle of taking the easy and more painless option at the expense of constantlyaking the future worse.",OskaMeijer,2025-05-04T13:16:06,2
"Pffffff no, not at all. Trump absolutely cheated in the election, but this isn't him openly admitting it. This is him talking about the 2020 election. I won't argue that Trump is too smart to admit he cheated in the election, but this isnt it.  If you're interested in how he actually did cheat in the election, look at voter suppression in the 2024 election. Genuinely, I think you'll find it interesting.",yamo25000,2025-05-04T11:33:25,0

"I'm not really seeing the point of your argument. You're saying we should impeach Trump, but also that we shouldn't work with republicans. How do we impeach Trump without the support of republicans? I'm not talking about bargaining, a lot of republicans want the same thing and aren't asking for anything in return. It's not like a tit for tat situation.  It seems like you're arguing for division for the sake of division. It'd be great if everyone in the country wanted the same thing, but the fact of the matter is that we have to live with people who don't always agree with our policies. If we, or if our representatives, refuse to do anything with republicans just because they are republicans, then how will we get anything done? I agree that conservatives hold up progress (and the current administration is actually *regressive*).  I'm still not really understanding what your solution is. We want Trump impeached, but you don't want conservatives to help with that in any way, which means we will never be able to do it because the house is currently controlled by republicans.  I'm obviously not under any delusion that conservatives will go away or that they'll all just start agreeing to everything we want, but we can at least find a middle ground, or stand firm on certain issues. Is that what you're getting at? That democrats shouldn't compromise their policies to meet republicans in the middle? If that's the case I don't think impeaching Trump is a compromise, or a middle ground. I agree that Vance will also be bad, but I don't think he'll be as bad as Trump, especially if Trump is successfully impeached. That will (hopefully) cause Vance to stay in line more than he would otherwise.",yamo25000,2025-05-04T13:56:09,1
