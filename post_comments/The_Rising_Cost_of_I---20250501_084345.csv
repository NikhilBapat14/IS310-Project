"We all knew this was coming - indentured servitude. They'll soon say it's too expensive to deport people, so they ""work"" off their ""crime"" via forced labor just short of calling it slavery because unlike slavery, they *may* get a chance to be free rather than have generations born in the same forced labor camp.",ConnectedVeil,2025-05-01T10:43:02,5

"*From Bloomberg News reporters Leon Yin, Elena Mejía, Rachel Adams-Heard, Polly Mosendz:*  A 19-year-old from India picked up near Miami. A 23-year-old Mexican man detained just up the Florida coast in Pompano Beach. An Afghan man arrested in New Jersey. Each of them, at risk of deportation, was flown thousands of miles to a detention center in the rural desert of New Mexico.  They’re among thousands of people the Trump administration has been shuttling across the country in recent months, boosting the cost to taxpayers while undermining the detainees’ chances of winning their cases. And it’s doing so even when detention space is sometimes available much closer to their homes.  Immigrants detained by ICE during the first month of Trump’s new term were taken across state lines at higher rates than previous administrations, according to a Bloomberg News analysis of more than a decade of detention records. Some detention centers along the Southern border are accepting detainees from the East Coast for the first time in at least a dozen years.
