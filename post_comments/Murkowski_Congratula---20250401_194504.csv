"yeah.. if she can not vote and help Trump, he wouldn't need to be doing this",supercali45,2025-04-01T20:22:31,178
Sucks that she voted for all of Trump’s appointees except for one though.,kbowiee,2025-04-01T20:54:25,97
I raise my glass to Cory Booker!,Spirited-Water1368,2025-04-01T19:58:21,77
That's what balls look like.    I worked in an occupation that allowed me the privilege to work 24-36:hours straight.  I applaud him for being able to stand and speak for that amount of time.  I couldn't do it.,mrg1957,2025-04-01T20:19:25,40

"Now if she’d consistently call out the orange horror and vote against him, she might actually exhibit some actual value.",TheNetworkIsFrelled,2025-04-01T21:54:36,6
She was presiding over at the end and was clapping,[deleted],2025-04-02T11:10:54,2
didn't the republicans immediately vote on the trump nominee? like while Booker announced he finished. and didnt she vote to accept him?,TemporaryTangelo4084,2025-04-01T22:29:38,2
"Jump ship while you can, Murkowski",mackinoncougars,2025-04-02T08:13:32,1
"She’s not really a moderate or a compassionate conservative. That’s her disguise. She will never vote against the GOP unless they don’t need her vote to do something, then she can play the moderate.",akrobert,2025-04-01T21:39:55,48
It’s not difficult,akrobert,2025-04-01T21:40:16,10
I don't even give her the time of day. I hear that name and just move on...,_ChicagoSummerRain,2025-04-02T08:32:52,1
"> She’s not really a moderate or a compassionate conservative. That’s her disguise.   You're talking about that fake Susan Collins. I can respect Murkowski because, while it's rare, she will stand on principle.",appmanga,2025-04-01T21:53:08,10
Name one. Name one time that something went down in defeat because Murkowski voted against it,akrobert,2025-04-01T21:55:33,10
"2017 ACA repeal attempt. While McCain was the deciding vote, she deserves credit where credit is due for helping prevent its end.",Majestic_Electric,2025-04-02T00:21:25,11
"> Name one time that something went down in defeat because Murkowski voted against it  When the Republicans tried to kill the ACA in 2017, she voted against that. You're welcome.",appmanga,2025-04-02T15:43:01,0
One thing 12 years ago and we all know McConnell thought he had the votes until McCain torpedoed it. I’m sure she would have changed her vote to help the gop,akrobert,2025-04-02T08:11:24,6
Funny that you think that’s true. She only voted to protect the ACA because they assumed McCain would back McConnell. Had she known McCain would kill it she would have voted to kill it,akrobert,2025-04-02T16:05:13,1
"That was 8 years ago, actually, but point taken.   And she was also the sole “no” vote on the Republican side during Kavanaugh’s confirmation. So, that’s something (which can’t be said of another, supposed moderate Republican Senator).",Majestic_Electric,2025-04-02T11:38:32,4
"Funny, you need to change what actually happened. You asked, and I gave you the fact, which doesn't change because of ""yeah, but"". Deal with it.",appmanga,2025-04-02T17:00:40,0
"nope. she voted present. https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00223.htm (her excuse that she was canceling out a vote of a colleague who had to attend a family wedding holds no water; kavanaugh could have just been confirmed 50-49). after 23 years in office, let's admit that murkowski is just as reprehensible as every other maga. there are no ""good"" republicans in congress.",saigonrain,2025-04-02T14:07:19,2
Funny that you have no idea of the facts and feel the need to correct someone that knows Murkowskis record and doesn’t just hang out in the dem sub,akrobert,2025-04-02T18:05:40,2
