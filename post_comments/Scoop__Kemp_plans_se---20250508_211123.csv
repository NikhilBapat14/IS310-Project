"Hey Republicans, isn't the whole point of the primary to let your actual party members pick the candidate, not you literally rigging the race behind closed doors?",pierre_x10,2025-05-08T21:25:50,12
">Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning a White House sitdown with President Trump to get on the same page for supporting the best Republican candidate in the swing state's 2026 Senate race, sources tell Axios.  >In both the White House and the governor's mansion, there's concern with polling that shows firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene would win a Republican primary but lose to Ossoff. One poll conducted by a Republican group shows her getting ""smoked,"" said one person who had reviewed the numbers.  >""The president loves MTG. He doesn't love her chances in a general,"" the Trump adviser said.  >Greene has not ruled out a race, but those familiar with her thinking say she's aware of the perception that she could not win a general election. They also note she's a more savvy operator than publicly perceived and knows how to read a poll.   >Three names have been in circulation the most in the White House and this weekend at the governor's Sea Island retreat on the Georgia coast:  >Rep. Brian Jack. A longtime Trump adviser, Jack won his congressional seat last year and has signaled that he'd prefer to keep it. Many see him as being on the leadership track, and he could run the National Republican Congressional Committee next cycle. But if Trump demands he run, he'll likely do it.  >Small Business Administrator Kelly Loeffler. A former senator who lost her race in 2021 to Sen. Raphael Warnock, Loeffler is another Trump favorite because she knows what the job entails and she has run statewide before. But an adviser said she would prefer to run for governor.  >Rep. Mike Collins. He has been a Trump supporter since 2016 and sponsored the Laken Riley Act, cracking down on undocumented immigrants who commit serious crimes. It was the first act Trump signed into law this year. Collins has been traveling outside his district to drum up support and hosted a political event this past weekend that drew hundreds of people.  >The early default favorite is Collins:  >""He lines up on the Venn diagram,"" said a top Georgia Republican strategist. ""He's at every [Trump] rally. He's a trucker, so he has a blue-collar business background and would be the firebrand, workhorse candidate.""",Goosedukee,2025-05-08T21:13:09,3
">Greene has not ruled out a race, but those familiar with her thinking say she's aware of the perception that she could not win a general election. They also note she's a more savvy operator than publicly perceived and knows how to read a poll.       I highly doubt that. She’s only slightly better than Rep.

MTG is gonna be pissed at her orange crush.,BigDaddyBain,2025-05-08T22:55:14,2
My 2 conspiracy theories about Kemp whom I don’t like but think is very smart.  1) he’s smart enough to know that the GOP will be toxic in the upcoming cycle and wants to avoid a loss. He’ll look into the senate when dems are in power. Georgia is fairly purple with Atlanta metro housing most of its residents.  2) he wants to be a king maker not front and center anymore.,slapwerks,2025-05-09T11:14:33,2
"It’s odd watching Kemp cuz he clearly can’t stand Trump. He sees Trump for what he is and has no illusions. But he has to pretend he likes Trump to get the MAGA vote. It’s both entertaining and pathetic to watch. Plus he has to pretend he likes MTG. We need Kemp in the Senate, I can see him voting to impeach Trump. Maybe.",Adept-Look9988,2025-05-09T09:58:30,1
“…They also note she's a more savvy operator than publicly perceived and knows how to read a poll.”  She can read?,NEOK53,2025-05-09T10:04:26,1
Unfortunately they love Kemp for some reason. ,Designer-Contract852,2025-05-08T21:52:47,2
"Wow, Loeffler thinks she would win governor? Lol",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-08T21:55:12,4
"I think his likability would not transfer to the candidate he supports. The reason why the GOP wanted him to run for the Senate in the first place was that he was there very best option and probably the only one who could win. Trump has a negative approval rating in Georgia, coupled with Ossoff being very well liked in Georgia, it’s not good for anyone not named Kemp.",D-MAN-FLORIDA,2025-05-09T01:30:41,3
Walker came way too close for comfort and Jill stein will likely run as an independent senator for Georgia...just because.,RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-09T05:38:31,1
