"Correct me if I’m missing something here, but this ruling seems to entirely miss the point. A ghost gun is sold and distributed as parts, not as a whole gun. As such a) you’re never actually purchasing a “gun”, and b) where would the serial number even go? Which part is “the gun?” Which part triggers the background check?  This seems performative, there’s no real way to enforce this based on my understanding.",abstrakt42,2025-03-30T09:10:57,7

"All guns should be traceable. I'm glad the frame of the ghost guns are numbered, and SCOTUS did their job",Walk1000Miles,2025-03-30T23:11:24,3
The serial number of the frame is the serial number of the gun,Lentemern,2025-03-30T10:39:07,9
"The SCOTUS ruling makes it a law in all states - it is a federal law.  The idea someone can order a gun in the mail and that they will be traceable, according to this ruling.  Gun number xxx will be attached to owner xxx. If sold? It can be traced, as needed, by the proper authorities.  I'm happy this is a Biden Administration action that Trump and his sycophants can't undo.",Walk1000Miles,2025-03-30T14:24:30,5
