"Raiamondo overhauled the Rhode Island pension system when she was state treasurer, including converting part of it to a 401K instead of a guaranteed benefit. She also was the founder of a hedge fund and has deep ties to them. She's exactly the kind of pro-business/corporate Democrat that doesn't care about meaningfully advancing the interests of working people and that has been ruining the party over the last 30+ years.",Naviers_stoke,2025-04-29T18:53:47,7

Thank you for mentioning her deep and profound corruption. People who voted her and still support must not pay attention to politics--or maybe they got one of the many kickbacks she handed out.,Long-Researcher777,2025-04-29T19:53:17,1

"Really? Because the last moderate candidate (Harris) tanked, and part of that was guilt by association with Biden’s moderate crap: Palestine was a no-brainer and they lost the left-indies as well as the moderates who actually felt something for other people, retaining NeoLibs and those of us who understand how fucked the Electoral College actually makes us all.  If you mean keeping people who don’t stand for anything and want to “hear from all sides” STILL- fuck them, they’re clearly along for the privilege ride of being ‘Murican- they’re underinformed, clearly moved by bandwagon fallacy, and still fall for Boomer/Neolib Redbaiting over VERY popular policies like Universal Healthcare. Look at that class traitor Elissa Slotkin, repeating GOP talking points denying the distribution of wealth TO the wealthy over the past 50 years, downplaying economic inequities and reality specifically to appease corporate support. Moderates pave the way for authoritarians- show me an example where they fought them off instead.",Interlocharcuterie,2025-04-29T23:45:10,1
"Really? Bera, censuring Al Green is “winning”? Booker grandstanding and then turning around and pouring more weapons into Israel is “progressive”? We are the laughingstock of the world precisely because we all all hat and no cattle on progress- the same class infighting that was stirred 100 years ago is being replayed, and we’re the only country post-WWII to continue to fall for it. Name a moderate packing arenas in Bakersfield or Oklahoma right now- and then ask how Sanders and AOC are actually doing that. When in WORLD history did a moderate overcome authoritarians without a war? HINT: never.",Interlocharcuterie,2025-04-29T23:37:09,2
"Promoting actual progressives, and pushing moderates (which literally means “I stand for nothing in particular” and simultaneously “I go with the wind”) to adhere to expectations higher than that of 90s Republicans. Get a backbone- shame them at airports and restaurants, write and call and email and stand outside their offices, vote them out, stand up and be specific at town halls…   If you think a moderate accomplishes anything more than perpetuating the status quo under the BEST of circumstances, I want what you’re smoking.",Interlocharcuterie,2025-04-29T23:33:27,2

"‘ Name a moderate packing arenas in Bakersfield or Oklahoma right now’  Name me a time rally size has mattered.   ‘When in WORLD history did a moderate overcome authoritarians without a war?’ Romania, Spain, I could go on. In fact it’s usually a moderate.   Going from a hard right wing people tend to go moderate. Look at Canada. The fight against facism did not lead to people embracing progressive parties, they abandoned them en masse.  ",Votesformygoats,2025-04-30T04:19:54,-1
Americans dont give a fuck about that.   Is she hot? Was she on a reaity show?

Romania violently overthrew Ceausescu- and executed him; the only Warsaw Pact country to do both. Is violent revolution the path of “moderates”? Do “moderates” get that win?  And Franco DIED in office and it was several years until the King abdicated when the Constitution was ratified in 78… after a lifetime of making “moderates” complicit while repressing dissent (which is by definition not what moderates produce). ,Interlocharcuterie,2025-04-30T05:06:24,2
