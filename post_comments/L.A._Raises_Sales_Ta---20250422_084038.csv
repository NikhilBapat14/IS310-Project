"The homeless money just gets pissed away by NGOs. It’s very ineffective spend, unless rewarding political allies who run NGOs and employ you after you leave elected office is effective spend.  The homeless units do get built but they don’t solve the criminal, drug addicted homeless crisis which is the one everyone is talking about really when they say ‘homeless’. Mandatory rehab or prison would solve that though. Or paying people to live in a non urban setting that is kind of like a voluntary much nicer than prison prison. Really, most strategies other than what we are doing plausibly would work better, but definitely wouldn’t pay the NGOs as much.",Unlucky-Prize,2025-04-22T09:30:01,72

"As a Californian, I hope others outside LA are paying attention. Democrats have no respect for taxpayers and even less so for the homeless. They will use any and every ""cause"" to enrich themselves and claim more power.",IVcrushonYou,2025-04-22T09:59:23,37

I bet if you took all the money California spends on the homeless and just cut a check to every bum they'd have 6 figure incomes,rocier,2025-04-22T12:14:49,5
">Los Angeles then launched a pilot program to build 8×8 aluminum sheds for the homeless for only $130,000 each and then tent encampments for the homeless for only $2,600 per tent each month.  How is this possible? What do these sheds and tents look like?  They could put up 1,500 sq ft prefab homes for less than this.",Rush_Is_Right,2025-04-22T10:26:27,13

"> The government is a racket uninterested in solving problems - especially when ""public servants"" are able to line their own pockets and operate without accountability  This is why I'm so against all these new taxes and social programs people float out. All that stuff would be fantastic. I'd love to support it financially. However, I have less than zero confidence in any politician managing that money effectively and making any notable changes for the betterment of society. All they're going to do is line their pockets and the pockets of their friends.",BadDadJokes,2025-04-22T09:14:45,126
Holy fucking hell. VA Lecia earned $430K running that entity. They paid someone that kind of coin to mismanage $2.5 billion????,GAMGAlways,2025-04-22T09:35:03,77
"The biggest dead giveaway about the endless ""fighting homelessness"" funding is that when people try to build the homes themselves or offer to do it for free, the state stops them. California has almost 1/4 of entire USA's homeless population (at just under 12% of the US total population).   Everyone laughed when DeSantis had his poop map during the debate, and then they all had a chuckle when Newsom admitted to clearing the homeless away for president Xi.",OliverMonster1,2025-04-22T13:22:07,29

The 2016/2017 tax hike for the homeless was a major red pill for someone I know.  She was so disappointed after they didn't spend any of the money on housing for homeless people.,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-04-22T18:35:26,5

"I have watched an interview with a homeless person living on Malibu beach. The interviewer asked if the homeless guy knew about the free housing provided by the government.
