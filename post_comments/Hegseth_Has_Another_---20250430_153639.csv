"Pete Hegseth’s affinity for Signal group chats with former *Fox News* producers is worse than we thought.  The defense secretary, who [faced calls to resign](https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-admits-he-had-to-give-pete-hegseth-a-dressing-down/) after a report revealed he texted military strike details in a Signal chat that included his former *Fox News* producer wife, was accused of having a *third* chat on the app that included his spouse.  The latest chat reportedly also included Hegseth’s senior adviser and spokesman, as well as another *Fox News* producer who is a close friend of Hegseth’s wife. What was discussed in the third chat is unknown, and it is unclear whether that chat remains active or not.

As I said before - it’s too hard to cheat on your wife without Signal lol.  The other stuff is a side effect. Bro is probably addicted.,SnacksGPT,2025-05-01T00:05:10,2

"Gotta admire the cojones of The Daily Beast, running an article about a serial womanizer, using a headline like that. Talk about fucking tone deaf. XD  If I was Josh Fiallo, I'd be on the phone with my freakin' editor right now.",builttopostthis6,2025-04-30T15:46:00,2
