">Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates is finally saying what he really thinks about Elon Musk’s DOGE shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development.    >“The picture of the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children is not a pretty one,” he told the Financial Times.    >Musk canceled grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, that prevents women from transmitting HIV to their babies because he thought the U.S. was supplying condoms to the terrorist group Hamas in Gaza in the Middle East.    >“I’d love for him to go in and meet the children that have now been infected with HIV because he cut that money,” Gates told the FT.",LockheedMartinLuther,2025-05-08T12:09:42,12

Or maybe a visit from the Gicetapo at a few Microsoft facilities.",Negative_Gravitas,2025-05-08T19:23:38,3
