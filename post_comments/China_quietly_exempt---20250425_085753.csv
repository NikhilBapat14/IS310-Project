"This is fake news being leaked to the press by the Trump administration, just like these talks with China that were a lie and just like the Xi phone call which was a lie. What semiconductors are made in the US that aren't made in Asia anyway?",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-25T09:10:42,7

"Despite ongoing tensions and conflicting statements with President Trump over trade negotiations, China has quietly exempted certain U.S.-made semiconductors from steep tariffs to shield its tech industry. While Beijing denies talks are underway, experts suggest the targeted tariff relief is more about protecting China’s economic interests than signaling a willingness to compromise.",brendigio,2025-04-25T08:58:47,1
"China has quietly exempted certain U.S.-made semiconductors from tariffs, signaling a shift in its trade strategy. The move comes as tensions between the two nations continue, particularly around technology and trade. These exemptions could be seen as an attempt to ease some of the economic pressures between the U.S. and China, potentially helping companies that rely on these critical components for their operations. It's a subtle but notable development in the ongoing trade war between the two countries.",LiveBarracuda8588,2025-04-25T09:05:40,1
