No president, ever, in the history of this country, would have been so dimwitted and insensitive to repost that image.  The man's idiocy knows no bounds.

"Even ChatGPT says its bad:   Thanks for asking—here’s my honest take, grounded in historical and democratic values:   ---  1. The AI Pope Image  The AI-generated image of Trump dressed as the pope, especially so soon after Pope Francis's funeral, isn’t just tasteless—it’s a symbol of how he uses spectacle and provocation to dominate media cycles. It mocks religious symbolism for personal branding, which alienates many and distracts from real issues. Whether it’s meant as humor or not, it reveals a pattern of self-glorification over public unity.   ---  2. Defunding NPR and PBS  This is a serious blow to independent journalism. While NPR and PBS aren’t perfect, they’re among the few widely trusted, non-commercial sources left. Cutting their funding is less about saving money and more about punishing dissent. That’s textbook authoritarian behavior: discredit and disable the watchdogs.   ---  3. Military Spending vs. Domestic Cuts  Trump’s budget proposal massively boosts defense spending (especially on futuristic tech) while slashing funds for science, public health, and education. That suggests a worldview where strength is measured in weapons, not wellbeing. Historically, that leads to brittle societies—militarily powerful but socially unstable.   ---  4. Power Overreach  From trying to defund watchdogs to executive orders against law firms, we’re seeing a disturbing pattern: Trump is treating government not as a public trust, but as a tool for punishing enemies and rewarding allies. This undermines the rule of law and weakens democratic norms.   ---  My Overall Take  Trump is not governing in the traditional sense—he’s running a campaign of constant disruption, where spectacle, loyalty, and confrontation take precedence over governance, truth, or unity. That strategy keeps him at the center of attention but risks long-term damage to democratic institutions and public trust.",bistandards,2025-05-03T17:50:38,2

"So, this is what you need to understand about this **very clear messaging.**  This isn't just trolling. It's signaling. It's politics. There's a reason a sitting congresswoman (MTG) felt emboldened enough to tweet of the Pope's passing that the ""hand of god"" was ""smiting evil"" and the balance of power in the world was changing.  These people do not believe Catholics are Christians. Catholicism itself is ""anti-Christian"" and will be targeted by these ""anti-Christian bias"" policies, I can promise you that.  How do you know that I'm right beyond some MAGA lunatic in congress writing blasphemy and getting likes on Elon Musk's nazi website and Donald Trump saying he should be Pope and then shitposting more blasphemy on Elon Musk's nazi website with this AI picture of him dressed up like the Pope?  Well, who is Catholic in the United States of America?  Catholicism is most prevalent among people from Spanish speaking countries. Mexicans, central Americans, South Americans, brown people who speak Spanish are Christians, but they're usually **Catholics.** Not baptists or any other kind of white reformist Christian sect.  Okay, okay, so Catholics comprise a large percentage of people Trump is already an enemy of, brown, spanish-speaking Immigrants. So who else is Catholic in the USA? There's like, white Catholics, right?  Yeah.  Where do they live?  New York, Massachusetts, Philadelphia-- the East Coast is where you find Catholic cathedrals, large populations of white Catholics: former immigrants from Ireland, Italy and other western European nations other than England.  Those are, of course, Trump's *political* enemies. Democrats. Obviously, not every Catholic is a Democrat, maybe most of them are Republicans. How many are MAGA? How many are loyal enough?
