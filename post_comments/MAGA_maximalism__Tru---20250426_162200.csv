"MAGA is a political ideology that fully embraces its inherent tribalism. Everything the in-group does is inherently good, and everything the out-group does is inherently bad, even if it's the same action. Politics, to them, is nothing more than half team sport, and half war, and the goal is to crush your enemies and seize power before they can do it to you first.",LordSiravant,2025-04-26T16:48:08,195

"The thing is: the people to whom this quote applied were depicted as ignorant but not malicious. They displayed the capacity to learn and grow.  Trump's movement is not that. They are people who harm, or support harming, people they don't like and then want to be told they are good people. They are (at best) morally lazy in addition to intellectually lazy. The intent behind it is malice rather than ignorance. They are reactionaries who think they need to put other people ""back in their place"" in order to raise themselves up. They are ignorant in the sense that this won't work (it will just shift more power to the top), but that doesn't change the fact that merely *wanting* to do this means they are malicious. Even if you look at this from the best possible perspective, and you basically need to apply a conspiratorial worldview to do so, sacrificing or persecuting other people to save yourself is immoral. Inventing endless bad faith justifications for why you do what you want to do anyway means you are a bad person trying to pretend to be a good one, rather than a bad person trying to be a good one.  In short: The drive behind this movement is selfishness as well as a rejection of empathy and equality. The ignorance is just there because being completely immoral is easier if you don't think about it and don't question anything.",barryvm,2025-04-26T16:52:18,7

"Power fantasies.  We got here by idealizing those without consequences: billionaires and extra-legal [super]heros.    - Modern American mythology is almost entirely about ‚Äùgetting away with it‚Äù or simply not having to deal with consequences of actions.       - This is the exact opposite of _empathy_, which in some sense is being able to understand the consequences of actions upon others.          - Truly putting oneself in the shoes of a:             - migrant working getting stiffed on their sub-minimum wages             - a (transgender) woman trying to go pee and getting arrested by a dozen male officers in the ladies' room             - the (......) woman in the next stall who is trying to pee and is ‚Äùmistakenly‚Äù apprehended as well because she has a strong jawline.             - the kid getting eyefucked by the staff at a convenience store because he's black and walking down the aisle  to buy some candy             - 20-something girl who's date made a joke about rape          - and coming to the conclusion that you truly don't want those things to happen.",girlpockets,2025-04-27T02:15:08,3
"I would strongly recommend reading ‚ÄúThey thought they were free‚Äù by Milton Meyer.  It was written in the early 1950‚Äôs by a Journalist who moved to a small city in Germany and befriended and did a series of interviews with ten people who joined the Nazi party, to try to understand why and how it happens, what the appeal was and when and if they could admit they were wrong.  It is a fascinating and harrowing book and provides the answers that you are asking for.  I read it years ago and it‚Äôs the rare sort of book that I‚Äôve regularly come back to in the years since to gain perspective on the present.  You know what- I‚Äôm going to copy a long passage below. Because it‚Äôs maybe the most important thing anyone can read right now.",Crawgdor,2025-04-27T10:19:57,3
