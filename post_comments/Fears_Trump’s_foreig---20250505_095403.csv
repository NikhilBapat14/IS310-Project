"We export way more entertainment than we import, if this is met reciprocal tariffs it could really hurt Hollywood.",JimBobDwayne,2025-05-05T10:05:02,19
Nobody could possibly take this declaration of a tariff seriously. You can’t tariff intellectual property. ,venividiavicii,2025-05-05T10:00:12,8

"I understand the fear, but what the hell would he actually tariff? The cost of production? How would they even go about finding out that information? There is no tangle product for them to tariff. It's the equivalent of saying that he is going to start tariffing reddit comments from people in other countries because those people are employed.  If they were to impose a tariff on their tax filings, it would just be written off with their P&L and lower the amount of tax that they would have to pay.   Unless I am completely missing something, this just seems like a giant nothing.",SharpNSlick,2025-05-05T10:04:33,7
Hollywood hasn’t come crawling to kiss the ring like Silicon Valley did.  That’s what this is.,Abydos_NOLA,2025-05-05T09:58:20,10

"Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t think tariffs are going to make the typical American movie or TV show any better.",cedarhat,2025-05-05T11:35:44,3
I guess American movies and TV show are more things for me to boycott. How will I live without yet another Marvel movie or Martin Scorsese making the same movie with the same actors for the 35th time?????,allgonetoshit,2025-05-05T10:16:28,3

"I suspect this will be implemented by forcing US streaming services, tv broadcasters, and movie theatre companies to pay extra to host foreign media, thus pressuring them to limit how many they do.",phoenix25,2025-05-05T13:13:15,1

"It’s not even just that. If people just start boycotting US made movies, the industry will collapse on its own.",Some_Trash852,2025-05-05T12:05:02,9
"It would be tax penalties on labor and locations overseas, and possibly also a restriction on deductible eligibility if they’re not domestic. Would balloon costs like crazy.",fache,2025-05-05T18:50:16,1
"That's what we're trying to figure out. Unless he legitimately believes movies are coming in via VHS tapes on cargo ships, which is a possibility, no one is sure how he'd tax any of this.  Other countries are getting film work by offering federal tax credits that make it cheaper to film over there. The US has state by state tax credits but Georgia or Illinois can't compete with Canada or the UK by themselves. California is trying to but they've got their own additional costs that still make it expensive.   If he wasn't a fucking idiot he could just toss a 10% federal tax credit that stacks on top of the state tax credits and outdo these other countries.",CassadagaValley,2025-05-05T10:34:01,5

"Right, applying a tax would make sense, but he has to use his magic word.   There is just nothing to place a tariff on, that's why I don't think this will amount to anything.",SharpNSlick,2025-05-05T10:57:26,2
