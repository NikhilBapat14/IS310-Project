>(d) Prohibition on limitation of scope.—No court may define or limit the scope of the duties of an official of the Executive Office of the President.  This is the heart of it. The destruction of the separation of powers.,spark3h,2025-05-04T20:10:27,95
I feel like if you're going to just post a bill it should be mandatory to reply with what it does and what what it amends does.,AWall925,2025-05-04T18:56:38,43
Big surprise. Republicans attacking checks and balances from yet another angle. Anything to protect their corruption.,rogue203,2025-05-04T19:00:35,33

So they know they are cooked? This is a positive sign.,Wide-Secretary7493,2025-05-04T19:06:41,2
Read the dissenting views  starting on page 26 of [this report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-119hrpt28/pdf/CRPT-119hrpt28.pdf). They make it make sense.,Frickin_Brat,2025-05-04T23:30:54,1
Jesus. There's still years of this shit to go.,MootchieFox,2025-05-05T00:23:47,1
This is all performative.  Won't pass the Senate even if the House somehow gets its act together.  Don't waste your energy chasing down chaff.,Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-04T20:32:58,1
"His presidential immunity only applies to actions taken within the scope of his office. On paper anyway.  If the ""scope of his duties"" is removed then he will well and truly become the de facto king of the United States of America.",Rykin14,2025-05-04T20:36:33,29
"All of §1456, really. It's bad.  ""(e) DISMISSAL.-In any action subject to removal under paragraph (5) or (6) of section 1442(a), **such case shall be dismissed unless rebutted by clear and convincing evidence establishing that the continued pendency of the State claim or charge would not in any way interfere, hinder, burden, or delay the execution of the duties of the President or Vice President**.""  Deadass saying that they have to throw the case out if actually arguing it will slow down the speed at which they are perpetrating crimes against humanity (like making them wait on deportations while they figure out if they're even legal for example).  Wow.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-04T23:34:01,16
"Article One of the United States Constitution and Enumerated Powers. Whether it is in the parameters of the constitution determines whether it falls under the umbrella or outside of the umbrella of the Supremacy Clause.

This language is incredible. Clearly unconstitutional. Truly our democracy is in danger.,hammeredhorrorshow,2025-05-05T09:19:20,1
"In simple terms, this bill makes it significantly easier for current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, and other federal officials to move state-level criminal prosecutions or civil lawsuits against them into federal court, and it creates strong presumptions of immunity that make it much harder for those state cases to proceed.",Ok-Salamander-9566,2025-05-04T19:02:17,48

Which will still be as worthless. 2 branches have basically ceded powers granted to them by the Constitution. We are speedrunning Nazi Germany and the only fix is to completely remove the tumor.,Frowny575,2025-05-05T01:19:39,5
This is a Republican bill that aims to give even more power to the executive.,Purusha120,2025-05-04T21:00:58,13
And consequently would also enable the president to effectively pardon state-level offenses (given they can only pardon federal offenses).,Downside_Up_,2025-05-04T21:09:27,15
"It would if it would pass, but it won't, which I explained above.  Save your outrage for actual problems.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-04T21:32:10,-8
That's not how it works. Federal courts regularly handle state claims for a number of reasons -- it doesn't make state claims eligible for presidential pardons just because the case is heard in federal court.,ManyInterests,2025-05-05T10:46:14,1
"It's perfectly reasonable to think about how much farther Republicans are taking this. There's more than enough outrage to go around, I fear, and more than enough ""actual problems,"" including this one. None of what I said is inaccurate and I think it's silly to act like ""performative"" bills don't matter when the house has already reversed more than a few regulations (and yes, I know the filibuster would hold this up, but I don't understand the complete dismissal)",Purusha120,2025-05-04T22:10:08,6
"I completely disagree.   One of the primary tactics that the Trump administration uses is to repeatedly and constantly do things that generates outrage in the opposition. Individual things that would historically doomed any politician are lost in a flood misconduct.   Right now, the Republicans are stripping basic rights like due process and defunding basic pillars of American society.   Ridiculous bills that are going nowhere are just a distraction for people who should be focusing on actual problems that are happening right now.  Everyone already knows that the Republicans in Congress are craven traitors.  They've already enacted rules and policies that support the fascist behavior of the administration.   If someone wants to point out how this bill for the support's the case for exactly how terrible the Republicans are, great. All the wailing and gnashing of teeth about how they're removing rights with this bill are a distraction because the bill will never become law.  Both parties have a long history of passing peformative bills in the House that they know from the outset will never go anywhere.  They do this to feed red meat to their base and to generate outrage in the opposition, taking oxygen away from actual meaningful fights.   Again, I have no issue with someone pointing this bill out and noting how terrible the Republicans really are. But it makes no sense to get all worked up about a bill that will never go anywhere.    While it is certainly reasonable to be outraged, allowing these performative bills to distract from the real battle just simply playing into the opponent's hands.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-05-05T02:05:00,1
