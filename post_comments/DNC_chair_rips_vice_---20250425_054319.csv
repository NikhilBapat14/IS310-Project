The DNC chair who is mad at David Hogg is quoted as saying “party neutrality is crucial to maintaining the confidence of voters”.   Well as a diehard liberal who has absolutely zero confidence in the Democratic Party’s ability to do anything but lose gracefully I can guarantee you this will be a disaster. If Chuck Schumer can give Trump everything he wants while seemingly counting on Republicans to come to their senses without any fear of a primary challenger then we are so supremely fucked.,bestforward121,2025-04-25T06:45:51,22
