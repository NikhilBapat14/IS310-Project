"*The* *Wall Street Journal* has reprinted excerpts from the remarks delivered by Hoover Institution Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics [Kevin Warsh](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/kevin-warsh) last Friday to the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Thirty. In his speech, “[Commanding Heights: Central Banks at a Crossroads](https://www.hoover.org/research/g30-spring-lecture-2025-kevin-warsh-commanding-heights-central-banks-crossroads),” Warsh argues that the Federal Reserve has strayed from its core remits of fostering price stability and maximum employment. Warsh notes his commitment to the idea of “operational independence of monetary policy as a wise political economy decision,” and his belief “that Fed independence is chiefly up to the Fed.” Calling for a “strategic reset” at the Fed to restore its credibility and improve its macroeconomic policymaking outcomes for US citizens, Warsh concludes that the American “constitutional republic accepts an independent central bank only if it sticks closely to its congressionally directed duty and successfully performs its tasks.”",HooverInstitution,2025-04-28T16:23:42,1
