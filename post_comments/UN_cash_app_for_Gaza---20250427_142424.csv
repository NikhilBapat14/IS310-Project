Let’s be honest. It was a scheme to get the money in Hamas hands. Virtually all aid to Gaza is accumulated by Hamas,CCCmonster,2025-04-27T17:32:49,31
Anyone that thinks aid to Gaza doesn't benefit Hamas should not be paid as much as they are.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T14:47:07,60

By design no doubt. The UN never met a terrorist it didn't want to give money to.,triggernaut,2025-04-27T16:55:00,19
"Pam at DOJ, if any of this is USA monies, investigate and prosecute!  The aid system is being manipulated by Hamas and affiliated traders. Hamas does this largely behind the scenes, leveraging their control over large merchants, crime families, and using cash to establish a shadow banking system within Gaza.""  And Pete over at DOD, maybe a few more runs against Hamas! Immediately!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-28T05:41:05,2
