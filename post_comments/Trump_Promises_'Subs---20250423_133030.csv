> we had the wealthiest country we ever had proportionately from about 1870 to 1913    I suppose he's referring to the robber barons and to the industrial revolution prior to their being any worker protections whatsoever.    If you judge the success of a society by how rich its richest people are then I guess that was Trump's ideal.  I think that the best period in American history was when our standard of living was the highest for the greatest number of people.

"That's the law that gave us income tax.  We didn't have ""so much money, they didn't know how spend it"".  They were so desperate for funds from the desperately poor economic state of the country prior to the civil war, with a war to now fight, that Congress enacted an income tax, the Revenue Act of 1861. The was overturned after the war as unconstitutional. This was fine as the funds were no longer needed... At least if to former Confederate congressmen, it wasn't a priority. I believe they just didn't want to actually implement Reconstruction. God forbid the president's promise of 40 acres and a mule to former slaves actually be honored.  But when again the federal government was desperately poor in 1895, they implemented the [Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%E2%80%93Gorman_Tariff_Act), which was overturned by the supreme court as unconstitutional.  Years later, 1912-1913, when again the federal government was facing essentially bankruptcy, the 16th Amendment to the US Constitution was ratified, allowing congress to levy an income tax, which was done immediately after by this Revenue Act of 1913. As again, THEY WERE DESPERATE FOR FUNDS, NOT RICH.  I know his supporters don't care about History, but we can't let him outright lie like this.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-04-23T14:11:08,15

"The last time they were this high, we had the Great Depression.  The economy slowed, and everyone suffered as a result.  Tariffs can work! But they need to be SPECIFIC to an industry you're trying to encourage growth of AND you need to ACTUALLY FUND AND REGULATE the creation and development of that industry.  A tariff on toothbrushes is fine, so long as you actually build several toothbrush making factories, and fill them with jobs.  Economics are all about speed and throughput of transactions. More people able to spend money, means there's more for them to buy, means there's more for everyone as a result. Innovations and quality of life improvements require an economy able to support them.   Tariffs fundamentally are tools to slow or impede transactions, an inhibitor. Blanketly applying them is both a stupid mistake, and going to slow ALL transactions, as prices rise, but wages and jobs don't.  There will be far less to go around, and far fewer people able to afford it.  I'd personally recommend switching as many dishes as you can to use rice, which can be bought inexpensively in bulk, and lasts for ages. I have a few 5-gallon buckets of the stuff.  Maybe time to break out the Depression era recipes too.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-04-23T14:29:45,6
