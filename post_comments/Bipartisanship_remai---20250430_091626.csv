"Well, no fucking shit. If the Dems wanted to be bipartisan on this kind of bullshit, the republic is lost. ",877GoalNow,2025-04-30T09:22:08,19
"Why the fuck are we even talking about ""reaching across the isle""??? Republicans are offering 1930's Germany.",williamgman,2025-04-30T09:28:27,16
"I remember when Republicans were terrified of the President having ""too much power.""  Fuck all of you now, you fucking hypocritical traitors.",ERedfieldh,2025-04-30T09:45:50,9
"I won't vote for Democrats that preach bipartisanship to me  The lofty ideals of reaching across the aisle to embrace our esteemed colleagues in the spirit of cooperative government   Yeah, I've heard that for 30 years.  Fuck the high road. I want bloodied warriors. Do you want my vote?",stonedhillbillyXX,2025-04-30T09:28:24,8
"There should be zero bipartisanship during a fascist takeover of the federal government led by an illegitimate president. None.  You do not co-sponsor bills with the fascists  You do not vote for the fascists bills  If you reach across the aisle, you might as well stay over there",wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-30T22:21:19,2
"The No Rogue Rulings Act (HR 1526), would limit national injunctions made against Trump’s Executive Orders by Lower Courts.    These so called “Activist Judges” are merely just doing their job, it’s Trump’s administration that are the ones complaining about their unconstitutional EO’s being halted.    It’s passed House and now sits in the Senate, awaiting a future vote.    It can be stopped by a Dem Filibuster or managing to convince GOP Senators to oppose it.    For those who wish to act against this awful piece of legislation, I’d advise using 5calls to contact your Senator as they have a handy script to use:    [https://5calls.org/issue/federal-court-attack-no-rogue-rulings-act/](https://5calls.org/issue/federal-court-attack-no-rogue-rulings-act/)    If you have a Senator of the GOP/MAGA variety, I have something to read which can help with that.

I mean there is Bernie sanders for the past 30 years in Congress and all the achievements he’s racked up. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-30T09:29:54,-1
"The only ""achievement"" from passing this bill, is unlocking 1930's Germany.  There is zero reason for Democrats to help Republicans kill the Judiciary.",CrashB111,2025-04-30T09:33:20,7
"Yeah, he's tattooed on my left elbow.  I've cast primary ballots for him, doubt I'll ever get that chance again considering his age  The Party told us to for vote for Clinton, so I did. After having served under her husband decades ago. I still fucking held the line.  So yeah, there is still Bernie. Thank you for highlighting and underlining my point",stonedhillbillyXX,2025-04-30T09:34:24,4
"You’re right, we need more senators like Bernie so we can actually enact his vision.",meTspysball,2025-04-30T10:00:04,2
