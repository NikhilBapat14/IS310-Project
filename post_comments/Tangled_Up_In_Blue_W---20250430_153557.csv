"In a new episode of *GoodFellows*, Rep. Ro Khanna, a prominent progressive voice whose California district includes parts of Silicon Valley, joins Hoover senior fellows [Niall Ferguson](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/niall-ferguson), [John Cochrane](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/john-h-cochrane), and [H.R. McMaster](https://www.hoover.org/profiles/h-r-mcmaster) to discuss tariffs and the use of executive power along with a host of other current issues. The panelists dive into “blue state” mismanagement, the feasibility of a “Marshall Plan” for economically downtrodden parts of America, and the chances of Democrats parting ways with their “old guard.” After that: the three fellows weigh in on the Trump presidency at the 100-day mark, the future of Catholicism after the death of Pope Francis, tax exemption for universities, their go-to takeout food (pizza, yes; haggis, no), and two April landmarks—the 250th anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.",HooverInstitution,2025-04-30T15:36:17,0
