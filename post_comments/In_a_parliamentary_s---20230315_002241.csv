"Probably not, a mass defection of MPs to the opposition would likely lead to an early election. Either the new majority would pass a motion of no confidence and the government would respond by dissolving Parliament, or the government would call early elections themselves before a no confidence motion could pass.  In the UK, it is possible that the new majority could try and pass a law to force their choice of prime minister. However, I doubt the newly formed majority could move quickly enough to do that.",PaleontologistOk7794,2023-03-22T17:51:15,2
"If in this hypothetical scenario enough MPs defected, odds are the knew majority party would opt for a no confidence vote and the parliament would be dissolved and reformed, or the government would resign and there would be a new vote. Either way, I donâ€™t think procedure would have any issues.",Phantom78611,2023-04-10T15:50:27,1
