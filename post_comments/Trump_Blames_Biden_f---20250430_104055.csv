I have a magic super power.  I can literally tell you exactly what Trumps response to anything will be.  The funny part is that he is blaming Biden for the shitty stock market while at the same time saying the stock market is doing amazing.

"I agree with Trump. The previous president is responsible for the economy a year after they leave office. That‚Äôs why Biden had to manage the largest inflation rate in history in 2021 - Trump Slump.  I‚Äôm curious at what point his cultists will wake up? Will it be the 200-400% inflation from tariffs? Will it be your boss letting you go because they can‚Äôt do business with Trump Tariffs? Will it be your bank posting the house you bought during Biden‚Äôs economy on Zillow?
