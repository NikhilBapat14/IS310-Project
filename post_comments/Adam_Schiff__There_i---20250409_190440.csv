"Where are we again on the national security breach on Signal? Assuming we'll never hear about that one again. Same will happen here, this will all be buried under 5000 more insane, illegal things in a month.",Fartron69,2025-04-09T20:08:53,30

"Good thing they have gutted the SEC who could look into this!     ""The moves have led the S.E.C. to pull back on its attempt to police the cryptocurrency boom and upended efforts at other agencies to protect worker rights.The speed and scale of the deregulatory moves by President Trump reflect his ambitious agenda to downsize government.But the upshot of all this upheaval is simple: Regulatory agencies that are intended to protect ordinary Americans, workers and homeowners are being gutted, consumer advocates say.""

Bro Trump could come straight out with it tomorrow. Charts and all the evidence. It won't matter. How far does it have to go before Republicans wake the fuck up?,kidgoalie39,2025-04-09T20:53:00,22

"The 10% tariff increase is still in place. So are the 25% steel/aluminum and auto tariffs. And the China 100+% tariffs.    The power to enact tariffs is explicitly a power of congress. The 'emergency powers' act invoked at the beginning of these tariffs is the fentanyl crisis.    There is no act of congress devolving the right to tariff to the president. It is explicitly, constitutionally, the right of congress.    Trump is openly making money pumping and dumping the entire stock market using blatantly unconstitutional methods. And he didn't take it all back, just the worst of it.   This is just straight up narcissistic abuse, but the narcissist is in charge of the fucking government.",VvvlvvV,2025-04-09T19:34:57,18

"Exactly. There are way too many things instead of happened and that are just yesterday's news. It's unbelievable the amount of shit he's done in less than 3 months. But this one really bugs me, They fired somebody who a couple of days after this happened for something that was less of a security risk. There's absolutely no accountability. And I don't understand why the military isn't standing up for what's right. They're supposed to be the ones who stand between us and those who seek to destroy.",G0-G0-Gadget,2025-04-10T00:43:48,3
