"The real reason: who will compel them to do their job? Typically, if a politician is doing a bad enough job, only the voters are in charge of dismissing them.  The more generous reason: politicians often spend time between gathering with the rest of their peers and spending time back in their districts. In an ideal world they'd be able to vote safely and securely via remote access and spend all their time with their constituents, but most places don't have that set up (or have actively prohibited it).  Disallowing remote voting can be beneficial in that it allows shenanigans during times when the governing body is not meeting or when some members cannot attend for external reasons (ie calling a vote when everyone goes home). More generously, a lot of virtual systems are not as secure as you might want for government business.",craftworkbench,2023-04-05T19:25:29,38
"Well they are accountable to voters, so you, their boss, can dismiss them for poor performance during elections.",Mkbw50,2023-04-06T05:34:10,8

"Their job isn't just to be in the office all the time. This is asking like why a salesperson is allowed to miss a meeting when they were off pitching a client. The job of a politician is to be in the chamber sometimes, be in the campaign office sometimes, be at home in their constituency sometimes, and be all over the place at random locations sometimes. Cotham wasn't absent from her job, she was doing a different part of her job at a different place at that moment.",mormagils,2023-04-05T19:40:30,14
"In Oregon, they no longer are. Oregon voters last year passed a referendum that would disqualify legislators from re-election if they had at least 10 unexcused absences in a session.",OverlordLork,2023-04-06T16:03:42,3
"Some aren't. For example, English councils automatically kick out councillors that miss meetings without a valid reason. There's a lot of reasons for politicians to not turn up that are perfectly valid, for example some have second jobs that contribute to society (e.g. doctors and dentists) that they have to do. In parliamentary systems MPs are also ministers and might be away on government duty. Some MPs serve in multiple roles that might clash (e.g. councillor, mayor, MEP or member of a regional legislature). Others have caring requirements where they might be caring for a parent, spouse or child that occasionally causes them to miss sessions. They also can serve in parliamentary delegations to foreign nations or as election observers. They also could be handling a constituency matter. Also, people can get sick, we're not machines. On summation: politicians do more than just show up to vote (some, like Sinn Feinn MPs don't even turn up to vote for ideological reasons)",SnooBooks1701,2023-04-07T05:04:10,2
Their real job is to get re-elected. Their second most important job is to promote policies of their biggest donors. This way they only have to be on record for the policies their donors care about which reinforces real job 1 and 2.,Timbukstu2019,2023-04-08T16:25:16,1
"Because technically it's not a job. It's a service they're elected to do on behalf of those they represent. That means there's not many mechanisms to ""fire"" them for dereliction or malfeasance. There's also no real consequence for most of them not showing up because of the way the political system works today. Not showing up or abstaining from voting is a political ploy to keep the person from having to go on record voting for or against something in a way that may piss off their constituents or future voters. It's accepted or tolerated because for the most part they make their own rules and all benefit from it which is the same reason no poitician has to explain why they vote a certain way or can be held actually (voting booth doesn't count) accountable for voting a particular way.",randonumero,2023-04-08T19:41:21,1

"The short logical answer is that Washington politicians are rated according to bills introduced, voted on, co-sponsored, and attendance. As long as their attendance and voting record stay within a reasonable positive ratio...they are doing a good job. It's the voters themselves who must keep track of the personal points they vote on and decide to stay with them or not. The flip side is that it is a corrupted manipulated system that allows politicians to dodge their promised commitments, make deals we never hear about, and enter Congress poor while leaving as a millionaire see Krysten Sinema, Joe Manchin, Richard Burr...too many too list.",Jakstrate1313,2023-04-11T16:59:29,1
I can answer that.   It is because no matter what they do we still vote to re elect them into office.,ace1244,2023-04-14T06:50:08,1

Originally politicians were public servants who didn’t get paid and had other jobs. But it was a different country and a different world 200 years ago.,ChairOwn118,2023-04-23T06:10:37,1

I've also wondered that too. And why are they allowed to just play solitaire on their computers if the do show up? They're not really listening and already decided how they are going to vote based on bribes or pressure applied beforehand.,GaiaSagrada909,2023-05-01T00:22:40,1

"The more powerful you are, the less accountable you are.  This is not the way it should be, but it's the way it is.

"While we see upsets each election cycle, or political system heavily favors incumbents. They tend to have name recognition and most importantly financial support from their party. The idea that voters can truly, reliably and reasonably hold politicians accountable is a fallacy that's never really been true.",randonumero,2023-04-08T19:43:04,0
"A politician's job does not include campaigning. That's their job interview. We don't pay them to campaign, and that's not among my personal list of excusable absences. By your logic, a salesperson could miss an important sales meeting because they're working on their sales pitch. A senator is there to perform the direct duties of their office; and right at the top of that list is voting on legislation. It's the entire foundation of a republic that they are selected to cast our votes for us.   Of course, there are additional aspects to the job. They need to write legislation, debate, amend, discuss in a public forum, and inform their constituents what that legislation is all about. They need to determine a budget and appropriate money.   Campaigning is something that they do on their own time. It's not ok that they're neglecting their job in the interest of keeping that job.   We should not expect this sort of attitude from our subordinates. Real change is destructive, and it's long past time we started tearing down the system that put us here. If you or I tried pulling that crap at work, we'd be out on our collective asses.  (Re-worded to remove profanity that the filter caught)",Shankar_0,2023-04-05T21:10:23,6
"Their job is to represent their constituents, their district, their state and their country. You're right that doing that doesn't require them to be tethered to an office but it should require them to vote because every piece of legislation has consequences for their constituents.",randonumero,2023-04-08T19:44:11,1
"That's not true at all. We literally do pay them to campaign, that's what fundraising is all about. Campaigning is a huge part of the job. Again, this is like saying we pay a salesperson only to close deals, not to source them. Good luck with that logic!  The system is designed to work on a quorum, so no, it's very much expected that you're not usually working with a full staff to do legislative business. That's how the system has *always* worked from the beginnings of legislatures. Your personal feelings on that being stupid doesn't change that.   And it's not like these guys miss votes just because they're campaigning. Often times they're doing essential work building coalitions, which certainly I guess isn't *not* campaigning, but it has real important purpose for actual casting of votes.   In fact, if you actually look at the facts in this case, Cotham missed the vote because of a pre-planned doctor's appointment. Only the shittiest of jobs don't allow you to miss work for a doctor's appointment.",mormagils,2023-04-05T21:25:16,2
Is that what Diane Feinstein has been doing all year? Campaigning?,Electrical_Skirt21,2023-04-13T06:20:29,1
"Actually, due to both bicameralism and federalism as well as standard parliamentary procedure, a huge portion of votes in the chamber are entirely inconsequential. The situation in this specific case was obviously quite consequential, and in cases like these almost 100% of the Dems would move everything around to be on the floor. But she was planning to switch parties, so missing the vote so the Dems were defeated was expressly the point.",mormagils,2023-04-08T19:49:32,1
"The citizenry does not finance an individual campaign. They have to raise that money themselves.  I made no mention of this particular politician, or her reason for absence. You mentioned that campaigning was part of the job we pay them to do.  It is not.  That's the job interview process. It's not a valid reason to miss a vote.",Shankar_0,2023-04-05T21:28:39,6
"clearly she could plan a doctors appointment, which is voluntary around a vote which is mandatory. I can't schedule a doctor's appointment when I know there will be an important meeting, most people in any form of leadership can't either.",chunkerton_chunksley,2023-04-06T01:09:11,1
Feinstein is *sick*. What do you want from her?,LtPowers,2023-05-02T08:51:43,1
You're right but that doesn't mean that your representative should not vote on every single one of those and be able to articulate the reasons behind their vote.,randonumero,2023-04-08T19:59:11,1
"How you think it should work is a different answer than how it does work. You may not like the answer, but the answer is that the job isn't to be in the chamber all the time and present for every single vote. That's just the reality. Dislike that answer all you want.  This is a very unusual situation in that Cotham switched parties from Dems to Reps right after this vote, so it was probably deliberate to miss the vote and allow the bill to pass, which is a decision she has a right to make as an elected representative. If voters don't like it, their recourse is to elect someone else next time.",mormagils,2023-04-06T09:32:03,4

"Do other workers have to resign when they get sick, or just lawmakers?",LtPowers,2023-05-02T09:50:54,1
"It's 2023, there's no reason a member has to be physically present to vote or can't send a proxy to vote on their behalf. Saying they can't vote on every single thing is a cop out that cheapens the responsibility of what they're doing.   Legislation that seems trivial to them or even me may be considered a life or death issue to one of their constituents and that's why they should be required to vote on everything and explaing in writing why they voted a particular way",randonumero,2023-04-09T09:11:40,1
"Yeah, it's pretty awful, but the remedy here is to vote her out next election. This is how representation works.

"Lawmakers, definitely… other employees depends on the duration of their illness. How long should someone remain employed while not doing what they are paid to do?",Electrical_Skirt21,2023-05-02T11:20:05,1
"I mean, there are reasons to actually choose not to vote on things. Some folks put forward misleading legislation that they want to force folks to take a stand on so they can misrepresent it during the next campaign. Or they genuinely don't care/know enough about the topic and abstaining is literally the most responsible thing. It's absolutely naive to think that voting on every single piece of legislation is a reasonable standard.   Also, justifying every single vote with a written essay would be a ridiculous amount of work and they already don't have enough time for all that they have to do now.  Again, this is a case of you're complaining about what you think the rules should be, not about what the rules actually are, and you're doing so without really understanding how the process works.",mormagils,2023-04-10T10:06:39,1
