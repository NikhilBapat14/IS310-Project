"I'm not sure the premise is true, I don't recall hearing about either of those two people.  Likely the difference is because some people are pushing anti-ukraine talking points, whereas there's noone interested in pushing anti-india talking points that would find it useful to push such a link.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-16T20:45:09,14
"Very few people are talking about Ukraine and Nazis, just the people reading Russian disinformation. This plays into the answer, which is that Russia doesn't care about India so they are not spreading disinformation about SC Bose. He also died almost 80 years ago, and I don't think it's any surprise that virtually no one in America is talking about a Indian Nazi sympathizer from WW2.     A different question might be more salient; why is Henry Ford's Nazi support rarely discussed?",Shr3kk_Wpg,2024-07-17T09:29:28,14
"Yea SC Bose went to Germany and even met hitler. But there is no indication he directly supported the Nazis, other than wanting their assistance to fight the British for India’s independence.  My enemy’s enemy is my friend was the thinking. He even met with the Japanese and was training British Indian troops who were Japanese PoWs who decided to join Bose.",zeta_cartel_CFO,2024-07-18T08:59:17,3
"The comparison is somewhat inadequate, but they were also similar in their ideology. On the one hand Stephan Bandera and his followers ""The Bararites"" served as the police for German SS; looting, killing and assassinating Poles and Jews all in the hope of creating a greater Ukraine with the help of the invading Germans. They were elated when Hitler invaded USSR.   Hitler and the German SS read Bandera well and promised him a greater Ukraine; of course, Hitler actually had other plans \[of further dividing Ukraine\].  The then Soviet Union not only fought the invading Nazis, but the Banderites themselves. Many Russians were killed and obviously school children and adults are familiar his atrocities. Soviet intelligence eventually killed Bandera after defeating the Germans.        When Western journalists traveled to Kiev in late 2013 to cover the Euromaidan protests, they encountered a historical figure few recognized. It was Stepan Bandera, whose youthful black-and-white image was seemingly everywhere — on barricades, over the entrance to Kiev’s city hall, and on the placards held by demonstrators calling for the overthrow of then-president Viktor Yanukovych.  The Western media, however hedged calling him merely a controversial figure and downplaying the Russian view.    The AZOV outfit consider him a hero a militia group; they are small but powerful. Although Zelensky had promised to rid of the militia when he first campaigned. He later reneged or was forced to do so, instead, incorporating them in the Ukrainian armed forces. They essentially remain as an independent fighting force and although U.S. had initially refused to send those groups any arms the U.S. recently lifted the sanctions.    Like Bandera, Bose also supported antisemitism. In his writings in 1942 he had published an article in the journal *Angriff*, where he wrote that Indians were true Aryans and the 'brethren' of the Germans. Bose added that Swastika was an ancient Indian symbol. Bose urged that anti-Semitism should be part of Indian liberation   Roman Hayes describes the troubled legacy of Bose with atrocities related to Jews in the following words: ... Bose was deeply disturbed by the treatment of Jews and other “undesirables” by the Germans. Yet he was willing to look away and maintain a relationship with the fascist power only in so far as they could assist Indian independence.   His only criticism of a defeated Germany after the war was that it should not have made the mistake of fighting on two fronts simultaneously. While Hayes declares it difficult for history to absolve Bose for his dalliance with Nazi Germany, he is also quick to accept that as a radical nationalist, Bose never had any concern for anything except Indian independence. Thus, despite their differences, Bose’s motivation for harnessing the Nazi war machine was a strong sense of anti-British *realpolitik*.  In my view, overall, they are both despicable characters, but when country finds figures or ideology, they find useful, they look the other way.",PsychLegalMind,2024-07-19T00:40:45,2
"A majority of Ukrainians *do* have a positive opinion of the fascist Stepan Bandera, and the reason this gets discussed might have something to do with the fact that the CIA has been propping up Banderites since the 1950's (read the declassified docs on Operation Aerodynamic on the CIA website), and that modern Banderites, in this case Right Sector and Svboda carried out a mass false flag sniper attacks during the Euromaidan protests which was pinned on government forces at the time resulting in the president to flee the country, and we know from the leaked Victoria Nuland call that the US had positioned their puppets strategically ahead of time to capitalize on the situation should a coup take place.  Are India's fascists currently in a US proxy war against Russia or China?  No?  Then that's why - they're geopolitically inconsequential at this time, relatively speaking, at least in regards to US interests.",Zeydon,2024-07-17T15:45:33,2
