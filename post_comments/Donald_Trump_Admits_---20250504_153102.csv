"Cognitive dissonance is something built into every human being. While it varies from person to person, it can be weaponized by everyone.   For example: when the policies of an administration make shopping expensive, a person, or people, can fox-and-grapes that shit into activism. Stuff is too expensive? Fine. We didn’t want it anyway. In fact, we won’t purchase a single thing for Christmas at all.   You can alter the cost of a lot by totally eliminating the demand. Pain is far more effective than protest. Protest is performative. Mostly unheard by the intended audience, and intentionally defied by the shitty current intended audience. If a people buy absolutely zero dolls (the headline example), it gets heard. With a bullhorn. Attack the ideology and you’ll get more of it, because these people are petulant teenagers who will just double down on their shittiness.

"“The Grinch Who Tariffed Christmas”  They used to have stockings, and tree lights, and drones, Little plastic-made trinkets from faraway zones. But I slapped on some tariffs—ten percent! No, make it twenty! Now toys from old China? There simply aren’t any.  I watched from my tower, a mile in the sky, As parents all grumbled, “These prices are high!” The shelves were half-empty, the gadgets were few, I said, “It’s the art of the deal—this is what winners do.”  And the libs, oh the libs, with their soy holiday cheer, Said, “We don’t need presents, we’ve got love and craft beer.” They painted some signs, tried to chant in the street, But forgot their pronouns and misspelled “elite.”  I laughed with a smirk—what a beautiful sight! “No TikTok this Christmas? I’ve done something right.” No Xbox, no Switch, no plush Baby Yoda, Just tariffs and freedom and homemade quinoa soda.  But wait—what’s that sound? From the cold little town? It’s singing? And hugging? They’re still gathered ‘round? No tantrums, no whining, no blaming of me? Even after I tariffed their whole Christmas tree?  I frowned, just a bit, from my golden desk chair, While adjusting my tie and my perfectly coiffed hair. Was Christmas, perhaps, just a tad overrated? Were the libs onto something? …Nah. They’re sedated.  Let them sing, let them knit, let them post on their threads— My base still wears hats and sleeps sound in their beds. And next year I’ll hit Barbie, Nerf, and Legos, Unless Hunter Biden confesses, or Santa says no.  So yes, I stole Christmas, but I did it with style, And I’ll steal it again—every so often, once in a while. Because nothing says Christmas like victory sweet: No toys, no inflation, and libs in defeat.  Courtesy of GPT-4o",northernillinoisesq,2025-05-04T22:08:21,-1

">  we need to come to terms with exploitative labour not being the means to an end we need.  Sure, exploitation is obviously bad and we should not be furthering that status quo even if it means making some sacrifices. Our happiness/convenience isn't any more important than that of a person in China, India, wherever.  > But you’re still not proposing how you compete with that, after they eventually take that top spot  The status quo might not have been amazing but it was and is pretty amazing compared to the ridiculous stuff we're doing now. So the simplest possible proposal would be: just stop, abort abort!  Our current tariff policy (being generous with that word) mainly comes from Peter Navarro who the administration took on board mostly because they liked the title of his book. He quotes a tariff expert in his book named Ron Vara... who doesn't actually exist! A fictional person he invented to give himself credibility. Ron Vara is even an anagram for his last name. Didn't even try to hide it. Did you already know that?  If we want to start emphasizing production the first step would be to hire _actual experts_ on the subject to come up with a plan that has long term advantages. Once again, our current plan appeals to the authority of fictional entities and was executed so incompetently that we tariffed our military bases and penguins. There is a way to move in this direction, and maybe there's a grain of a good idea somewhere (though it's hard to see in the current clusterf-) but _this_ is not how you do it.  >  what happens to your golden age of purchasing power when the scales tip the other way, and you’re not in any position to be competitive?  Customarily, we've been about technology. That's one way to stay relevant: we don't have to be toiling in the factory that produces a better widget ourselves, we just need to design the better widget. Of course, with how Republicans have been reducing education standards and keeping people dumb we (or they) have been slowly shooting ourselves in the foot and making that approach more difficult.  So here's another proposal: let's stop it with the self-inflicted injury. Try to do as much as we can to make sure our citizens are smart, educated, know how to apply critical thinking. And yeah, if we do that then it probably will hurt the Republican party. People will be voting after critically analyzing the merits, not just because it's their team, not because there's a book that says the sky wizard is telling them they should. We also sorely need ranked choice voting or something like that, there shouldn't just be two parties.  > we can look at a lot of these production jobs and see automation taking a major role  Good luck automating stuff with the current brain drain. Have you seen that article about China's surgical strikes on stuff like rare earth minerals that they're basically the only source of? It gets linked very frequently. I don't have the link available right now but good luck automating stuff when you can't acquire the raw materials to produce things like heat-resistant electric motors.",alwaysbeblepping,2025-05-05T06:24:11,2
