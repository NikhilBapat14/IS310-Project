"I vacillate between bottomless despair and unbridled rage every day with this administration. And it’s even worse because it was so obvious this was coming - to anyone who was fucking paying attention - this was the inevitable result of a second Trump regime.   A self-imposed Dark Ages makes nothing great again. From even a purely capitalistic angle, pulling funding on medical research that was on the brink of *curing* CANCER, HIV/AIDS, EVEN ALZHEIMER’S, *makes no sense*.",SpookySchatzi,2025-04-26T04:56:12,38

"From the article:  >At least three medical journals have received letters from the U.S. Department of Justice that questioned their editorial practices and standards, prompting several journals to push back and assert their independence.   >British medical journal The Lancet, which did not receive one of the letters, published an editorial describing the inquiries as “harassment” and intimidation, adding that U.S. science was being “violently dismembered” by the Trump administration.",MobileWisdom,2025-04-26T04:23:54,12
"And they be like ""If you can't question the science, that's not real science"".   The problem is a lot of questions have been answered numerous time, like the measle vaccine. And still there would be people asking well what is the proof that this is not making people gay or trans?",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-26T07:07:21,4
"What other sciences have been knee capped for decades by this insidious woke DEI anti -conservative bias? Meteorology? Geology? Astronomy? Maybe quantum field theory?  I demand the God given right to reject how the scientific method works for theories  and ""evidence"" that conform to my political world view! And if The Establishment won't let me do that, I will ""Do My Own Research!"" (watch crackpots on YouTube.)",windwatcher01,2025-04-26T09:34:41,4

If Musk's mother had cancer would DOGE pulled the research funding?  She is 77 so he may live to regret killing Alzheimer's funding assuming that he has compassion for his family.  He clearly does not have it for the rest of us.  (Not wishing Alzheimer's on anyone.  It is a horrible disease.   I'm just making a point about Musk's lack of compassion.),Only_Mastodon4098,2025-04-26T05:09:23,5
"I like your term self-imposed dark ages. Reminds me of the Civ game where you can slip into a dark age. I feel like we had a good ride, had a golden age, a normal age, now a dark age (aided by a greedy billionaire class and religion).",bacon-squared,2025-04-26T15:02:53,3
