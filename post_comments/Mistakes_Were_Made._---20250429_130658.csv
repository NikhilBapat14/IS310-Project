Maybe a system that depends on good faith and gentleman's agreements isn't a good system of government no matter how well thought out. A government of co-equal branches and checks and balances shouldn't be able to be turned on it's head in 3.5 months. There's serious systemic flaws in that case.

"If you read the article, it seems to be more of an ironic use of passive voice, imitating the style other outlets use to let the perpetrators have distance from the damage they've done. I mean, this paragraph could go harder, but it's pretty damning:   > I have never seen a government get so many things wrong, in so many different ways. It was like an Obamacare website every 18 hours. It was like the soft opening of Jurassic Park. And these were not the sort of run-of-the-mill snafus that are endemic to any large organization. They all had something in common: People who thought they knew better than everyone else took on work they didn’t understand, and sidelined the people who did. They were making mistakes, quite simply, because the people who didn’t make mistakes were gone, and because there was no one left to tell them not to, or to correct them when they did.  Or:   > Rather than acknowledge its propensity for pressing random buttons just to see what happens, the administration has codified many of its mishaps as policy. (A fair number, of course, were always matters of principle merely masked as incompetence.)  And:    > The driving force behind all of these errors is a carelessness about the world today that stems from a disregard for how it will look tomorrow, and a deep-seated loathing of the people who keep the lights on. On a case-by-case basis many of these were accidents. In the aggregate they constitute an ethos: a determination to break things in a way that the next person won’t be able to put back together—to shatter a way of life so thoroughly that in the future, no one will even try.",SlyReference,2025-04-29T13:35:56,10

Dejoy fucked with mail -in ballots in 2020. Democrats didn't do anything so guess what? Dejoy fucked the 2024 mail in ballots even harder!  Trump wasn't supposed to even be allowed to run in 2024 per the constitution. If they allowed him to run by trampling on the constitution, did they really expect him to follow it once in office? No. I call absolute bullshit.   All the Russian bomb threats weren't enough to redo the election like Romania did. That's why Romania redid their election. They got similar bomb threats.   The U.S. had Russians paying influencers, Oligarchs buying votes, Republicans were openly bragging about and colluding to rig the voting machines. And nothing...   Fastest election in my memory ever.

I recently found out Biden excommunicated the sentence of the judge that was the subject of the ""cash for kids"" scandal. This judge was selling innocent children to the prison system for money and his sentence got excommunicated by Biden. I know I'm getting off subject here but it's stuff like that that has me realizing the corporate Democrats will sell you out every time. It's either move AOC or Bernie adjacent or it's a dead party that will likely follow the lead of the Republican party with their constant lies and selling us out.

"Yes, the core of the problem is Republicans but my worry is that Democrats will continue help them even further than they already have.   Correction, if the DNC didn't screw Bernie out of his run in 2016 we would've avoided ALL of this. A lot of people didn't vote for Hillary because they felt they were not being given a real choice. And they weren't. They were cheated. My ideology is progressive but I live in a deep red area. If they let Bernie run without interference in 2016, he would've won. I had a lot of male friends in my area who were rightly pissed off about what they did to Bernie.   You need to have been paying attention to the news to understand what the deal with Gavin Newsom is. Conservatives have been trying to pass laws allowing genital inspection of little girls in sports to confirm if they are in fact a little girl. There have been documented efforts to pass such laws in West Virginia and Kansas. This is framed as an bill to ""protect women"" from an unfair disadvantage against trans girls in sports. I find it highly insulting to women and lacking in any data to back up the reasons for doing so. This is also a non-issue that only serves to hurt women and  little girls. There is a very negligible amount of trans girls/women in sports. It also legally places little girls into a situation of abuse by an adult. It's meant to deter women from sports altogether. Gavin Newsom saying he doesn't want men in women's sports will likely open the floodgates to such bills. He doesn't care. He's sacrificing women and children for his political career. I find it absolutely disgusting.   Yes Republicans are undoubtedly the core issue. I don't want Democrats to help them further than they already have.   How is not asking for a redo or recount of the election not a massive fuck up? They didn't even lose. The tabulation machines were rigged. Democrats just accepted it and cried home. That pisses me off to no end. It makes me feel like they sold us out. The only other option is absolute incompetence. They didn't do anything about Dejoy. Nothing about the bomb threats. Nothing about Elon literally buying the election. You don't need an extensive investigation and trial to determine, yes that was in fact a bomb threat. And NOTHING. Again, Romania redid their election just because they had similar bomb threats. This was willful neglect in protecting the election.",Historical_Usual5828,2025-04-30T15:29:35,1
"I beg to differ.  I love Hillary.  She was the top polling primary candidate in 30 years before the campaign kicked off.  She was nationwide the most commonly chosen top candidate to be president. All the attacks on her started then.    She also won a fair primary.  I'm glad she won because I voted for her in the primary.   If parents don't want to follow the rules, they can always have their kids play some other sport.  This is not remotely important.   The election is over.  Feel free to keep attacking Dems.  I think it's silly, just like your obsession with sports.",insuproble,2025-05-01T10:45:56,1
"Holy hell. In any other country you'd be called extreme right wing for a comment like that about ""iF PAreNTs Don't wAnNa FoLLow ThE RuLeS"" as a response to Republicans proposing genital inspections. Of course in some cases they took the inspection by any random adult with authority part out and amended it to quit specifying when the inspection would take place, but the point of the bill still stands and you're absolutely disgusting to suggest girls go through extra hoops just to enjoy the same recreational activities boys do. How is that democratic at all? And this has nothing to do with ""parents following rules"". That's a very manipulative way of twisting the narrative. It's about trans children wanting to play sports so they can develop and grow healthily like any other child. Same applies to any other girl in this context.  And no, she did not win a fair primary. As I said before even people in deep red areas wanted Bernie. Bernie was doing well. The DNC said they would rather have a Trump Presidency than a Bernie presidency because that would hurt their wallets. There were leaked e-mails and everything about it FFS. Democrats shouldn't have robbed people of a choice. That's not democratic at all. This kinda shit is why the US left wing is any European country's right wing, sometimes even extremist right.   And it's not like the Democrats don't know how to increase the standard of living or make taxes actually fair rather than a money siphoning machine from the bottom to the top with an extra added middle man to suck up even more money and make it harder for people to pay their taxes.
