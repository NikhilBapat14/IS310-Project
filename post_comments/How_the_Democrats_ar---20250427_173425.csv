"Former President Joe Biden himself bragged that he would try to ignore the Supreme Court ruling banning his arbitrary cancellation of billions of dollars in student loans.    Indeed, he boasted, “The Supreme Court blocked it, but that didn’t stop me.”  This is Joe Biden telling the USSC to go pound sand!  For three years, four local, state and federal prosecutors warped the law to neuter Donald Trump.    Most of the charges had never been brought against other political figures in similar circumstances.  The vast majority of the 93 weaponized indictments backfired on the liberal prosecutors, who had contorted the legal system for political purposes and now face their own ethical or legal quagmires.   The federal prosecutor Jack Smith belatedly reported accepting $140,000 in free legal services.   Georgia prosecutor Fani Willis was removed from the Trump case and fined, and is now under further investigation.    New York prosecutor Letitia James is now facing allegations of falsification of documents and loan fraud.  Including calling her dad on legal forms her husband!  Yet the Biden administration deliberately violated the law by allowing somewhere between 10 to 12 million illegal aliens to cross the border. Thousands had criminal records.   No one on the left decried any of these various affronts to the legal system.  The left also ignores its own hypocrisies and ironies: Those who weaponized the court system and destroyed the border now rail that Trump is acting unlawfully by not returning an illegal alien, an alleged MS-13 member and a domestic abuser with a propensity to ignore our laws.  Democrats do not own El Salvador — although they act like it when dictating to its government that El Salvador cannot detain one of its own citizens, on its own soil, for its own reasons.   Hypocrites!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-27T21:38:31,6
"They're priming their audience with this rhetoric. They're claiming over and over again that Trump is ignoring the rule of law and due process, so that the next time they're in power, and they *actually* ignore due process and the rule of law, it'll seem like nothing special or ""revenge"".",Yoinkitron5000,2025-04-28T15:35:38,1
