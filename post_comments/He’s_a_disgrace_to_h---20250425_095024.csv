Two of my nieces are autistic. No biggie. Beautiful girls. The oldest is nonverbal. And it is challenging on my sister. I totally sympathize that it is alot. I have 2 young kids and they are a lot. Let alone the challenges she faces.   But she has gone insane. Starting mommy blogging that she agrees 100% with RFK. Vaccines cause autism. Only organic gluten free inject tinctures made from herbs level crazy. I understand she feels validated. But it is so hard to watch your loved one drink the Kool aid that puts her kids at risk.   In TX. With measles. And her kids are at risk. It's so harmful.,CurrentDay969,2025-04-25T12:01:32,12

"I love how rw propogandists portray rfk jr as some sorta alpha male tough guy, like have you looked at him? He‚Äôs as healthy as your average methhead Floridian",amievenrelevant,2025-04-25T10:42:20,6
"Agreed. He is such a disgrace to not just his family, but to all families who have a loved one or friend who is on the spectrum.   I think he should be sentenced  to volunteer at an advocacy organization, summer camp, day hab program somewhere in this country for slandering and defaming individuals on the spectrum.   He better realize just how much of a cross to bear it is being on the spectrum and that his actions and words are deplorably ableist and bigoted.",Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-25T14:41:49,2

Hey now. He just said even more stupid stuff about drug addiction too. He‚Äôs piling it on.,AnComApeMC69,2025-04-25T14:23:42,1
We are so far beyond ‚Äúlet him cook‚Äù that he burned the already burned steak. It‚Äôs not even steak. At this point it‚Äôs the furthest thing from steak. You know what. He burned the steak so bad that he somehow managed to turn it into a vegetable. God himself said. ‚ÄúBro that‚Äôs not possible.‚Äù And he did it.,TTVTheMrPuff,2025-04-26T00:14:28,1

She has been this way for the last 10 years. I went to school for biochemistry and she doesn't believe a word I say. It's so disheartening and the kids are the ones that suffer. I wouldn't let people beat my newborns without being vaccinated. This was during COVID and family was so upset so they didn't visit.   We live in a time with so much information and ways to protect ourselves and they choose ignorance,CurrentDay969,2025-04-25T13:13:14,3
