"Trump is in the absolute worst position a Republican can be in. Usually Republicans get the benefit of inheriting good economies after Dem Presidents. Like Bush with Clinton and Trump with Obama. But instead of letting Biden/Harris continue to cook, America put Trump back into office in the middle of economic recovery. A position a Republican hasn’t been in for Decades. Trump got to govern over Obama’s 2016 economy, which is what people remember from his first term. Now he’s in a position where, get this, HE HAS TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE ECONOMY 😧!   Let’s just say, the Republican playbook of tax cuts and over-inflated contracts doesn’t go over so well during economic turmoil.",ViolentObama,2025-05-10T12:21:47,1

"What, is it now 40% or some bullshit  Edit: I was close. They claim 36% disapprove but also cite a poll from April and say it’s risen to 41%. The last bit is particularly troubling:  “Last month, a Navigator Research poll conducted April 24 to 28 among 1,000 registered voters found Trump’s approval on the economy has plunged to a net -16.  Just 40 percent of Americans approved of his handling of the economy, while 56 percent disapproved. This represented the lowest economic rating for Trump in Navigator’s tracking history.  The latest AP-NORC poll shows that these numbers have fallen significantly. Despite these economic apprehensions, Trump’s overall approval rating has seen a modest rise. Forty-one percent of Americans now approve of his performance, a slight increase since April.  This improvement could be attributed to heightened support from Republican constituents and a marginal softening of opposition among Democrats.  On immigration, results were extremely close, with a 49 percent approval rating, against 51 percent disapproval. Of those polled overall, 40 percent leaned toward Democrat, 38 percent Republican, and 22 percent independent or none.",beadzy,2025-05-10T16:18:10,1

"I've got MAGA relatives, so I can explain the voter mentality regarding the economy. It's this simple. It helps if you imagine it in a caveman's voice:  ""Price high now. Me vote for man from when price was low.""  It's that simple. Things were cheaper back when the orange shitgibbon was president, and since millions of Americans do not research issues, do not understand global macroeconomics, and do not want to put in the effort to address their intellectual shortcomings, they go with their gut.

Then they'll try to get in Vance for two more terms since he was only two years as president.  The fortunate thing about that is Trump's base will tear itself apart once Trump himself is gone.

"> Trump basically held it in the road and took credit. He shit it all down the golden toilet during Covid.  He tried to drive it off the cliff on his first term too with his trade wars bs...   The economy just had a shitload of momentum behind it so things were going fine. Hell, arguably even the covid era, economy was rolling on that momentum. Unfortunately they applied a recessionary economy fiscal policy alongside low interest rates, and dumped a ton of liquidity in to the markets during what was largely a period of high economic growth. Its one of the reasons why we got the insane inflation figures in the years that followed.   We nolonger have that kind of momentum, and he is fucking with the economy twice as hard while interest rates are kept high to try and keep inflation under control.   What we are headed in to not is straight up a stagflation economy... but worse on many fronts because he is fucking with supply chains, and various stabilizing government systems.",Competitive_Oil_649,2025-05-10T16:49:31,1
