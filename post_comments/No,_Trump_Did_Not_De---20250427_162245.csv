"While I agree we definitely need more context and better fact checking in our media, the case isn’t as simple as the author makes it out to be.   Yes, the mother was deported. Yes, she took her 2 year-old with her. [At the same time, there is well-sourced evidence that the child’s father, an American citizen, was petitioning the court for the child to stay and be in his custody.](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.210781/gov.uscourts.lawd.210781.1.0.pdf)  So to sum up: no, the administration did not target a 2 year-old for deportation. Rather, a 2 year-old was deported as a result of their mother being deported.   For some reason, and this is the part the judge is referring to when questioning whether there was any due process, the American citizen child was not permitted to stay with their father.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-27T18:07:01,151

Of course the MSM is going to deceive you into thinking Trump is deporting US citizens.  It’s what they do.,mdws1977,2025-04-27T16:48:48,61
It's really unfortunate the media has always made things up about trump so now it's impossible to tell when he really makes mistakes.,Hectoriu,2025-04-27T19:37:11,53

"Examples in the last week:  - see a headline about a man deported to Jamaica after being in America for 21 years only to find out he was a drug dealer who spent 15 of those years in prison for kidnapping  - see a headline about day laborers being picked up looking for work, only to find out that had charges that included assault, DUI, child abuse etc  - see a headline about a judge being arrested only to find out she actively tried to help a violent illegal alien avoid an arrest warrant   - see a headline about a 2 year old US citizen deported only to find out her mom, here illegally, was deported and chose to take the 2 year old with her.",aCreditGuru,2025-04-27T20:17:17,21

"I tried to counter my cousin's Facebook spam about how we are shipping innocent citizens off to concentration camps (the current spin on gang members being held in El Salvador). I gave him a litany of examples of mainstream media misrepresenting stories since Covid. Of course his friends jumped in with ""sOuRcE?!""  No, I don't have any reliable sources to give you, because it's all propaganda. You have to watch live broadcasts and ignore all commentary and come to your own conclusion from uncut footage. But pulling your head out of the sand and facing just how widespread the corruption in our country goes is too intimidating for most.

"Usually for 1 of a couple reasons. The most obvious being they would never qualify. Whether it is they have a criminal history, or some other disqualifying factor. The other reason happens all the time but is more on the hush hush. Some people keep their status intentionally illegal and try to stay hidden from the government because they can find employers to work with them.

"Thanks for the clarification. It actually gets even trickier: 1) there is no evidence either way on his citizenship, and agreed that the assumption would likely be in the negative, else why not declare; 2) the father “[had filed for a temporary transfer of legal authority, which according to state law would give his sister-in-law - also a US citizen - custody of the children.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g278yn4d3o)” That sister in law is the Trish Mack referred to in the court documents.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-27T20:08:49,15

"All the same, you'd have to afmit it's pretty crappy for the kid, a citizen, to either move into foster care or be part of a deportation through no fault of their own. But the law is the law.

"""To your request of my opinion of the manner in which a newspaper should be conducted so as to be most useful, I should answer ‘by restraining it to true facts & sound principles only.’ yet I fear such a paper would find few subscribers. it is a melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not more compleatly deprive the nation of it’s benefits, than is done by it’s abandoned prostitution to falsehood. nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle. the real extent of this state of misinformation is known only to those who are in situations to confront facts within their knolege with the lies of the day. I really look with commiseration over the great body of my fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live & die in the belief that they have known something of what has been passing in the world in their time: whereas the accounts they have read in newspapers are just as true a history of any other period of the world as of the present, except that the real names of the day are affixed to their fables. general facts may indeed be collected from them, such as that Europe is now at war, that Bonaparte has been a successful warrior, that he has subjected a great portion of Europe to his will &c &c. but no details can be relied on. I will add that the man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them; inasmuch as he who knows nothing is nearer to truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods & errors. he who reads nothing will still learn the great facts, and the details are all false.""   \- Thomas Jefferson  - letter to John Norvell 1807.",Yoinkitron5000,2025-04-28T15:02:18,2
The only reason why the father wanted his daughter transferred to a US citizens custody is so that the mother (and himself when he gets deported) can sneak back over here more easily.   Lot harder to sneak across the border with a two year old.,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-28T07:30:57,-3
