"Tired of those MAGA that compares him with FDR. FDR got most of his things done by the congress, and he was able to pass a dozen important legislations in his first 100 days. He is the one that started the 100 days thing, and after his 100 days his approval rating was increasing.  What Trump does is completely opposite. Nothing get done by the congress (which is the correct way), tanked the economy and approval rating just free fall.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-04-29T09:35:48,8
