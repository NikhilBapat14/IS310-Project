"Republicans like to complain about the size of cost of the government, reduce taxes to make their policies popular but then increase spending which increases both the deficit and debt. Dems attempt to shift the tax burden on who can afford it, provide additional support programs and policies, and REDUCE the deficit but unfortunately still increase the debt. Right wingers point out that the debt grows under Dems, but miss the fact that by reducing the deficit and eventually creating a surplus, the debt goes down. We see this in Kansas politics - we went from having a HUGE deficit and debt under Brownback to now having a surplus so we can weather the storm of unpredictable government support, but the right wingers want to ""give that money back"" in the forms of tax cuts and we'll be right back to where we started. Meanwhile, we just passed a flat income tax that will penalize the lower earners.",Cats-And-Brews,2025-04-14T11:30:35,5

I know. Mainly because Republicans kept blocking him in Congress. He even lamented that he had promised the people so many things but never could achieve it. But presidents always get both blame and praise for everything regardless if it's deserved and even when they had no power to control the issue in question.   People just don't get that. Often it happens too that Republicans wreck everything and then democrats are voted in expected to clean up the mess and take the blame. If democrats don't deliver asap then here comes the next red wave to f*** it all up again and the cycle repeats.,Repulsive-Seesaw-445,2025-04-16T12:50:48,1

He literally swaps between debt and deficit when the OP only talked about deficit. They were flat out wrong.,SandiegoJack,2025-04-14T05:26:57,10
Debt is overall what the nation owes. Deficit is year to year. You can decrease the deficit but the national debt is so high it will still go up.,Harriska2,2025-04-14T10:17:53,3

You are correct with the statement that Lincoln was a republican. The issue is the conservative and liberal changed or swapped political titles. Dems used to be the conservative and Reps used to be liberal.  https://www.studentsofhistory.com/ideologies-flip-Democratic-Republican-parties,Brave_Buddy2483,2025-04-14T13:10:51,23

"Wrong because Trump inherited a large deficit caused by Bush and Obama. He worsened it with his tax cut. But it is wrong to think that Obama magically fixed the deficit and then Trump made it worse. He worsened the deficit, but it was already bad.",TinyAd6315,2025-04-14T09:21:36,-18
"Yes because OP was wrong. Trump didn't increase the deficit by 2 trillion, he increased the Debt by 2 trillion.   And no, Biden did not lower the deficit, that is flat out wrong.",TinyAd6315,2025-04-14T09:08:27,-1

"Imagine you have a debit card with a limit of $1000 every month. Spending over this budget forces you to put stuff on a credit card, adding to your debt, every month you go over $1k.   But you can’t judge each president by their total DEBT because that is a reflection of every president before them too (if the last president spent 10x the cap every month and racked up the “credit card”, the next president will have a ton of debt through no fault of their own).  Adding deficit (unpaid “credit card” debt) adds to the debt. Lowering the deficit (spending less than $1k a month, pocketing the remaining cash) reduces the debt.   All republicans here added to the debt *by increasing the deficit*. All democrats (except Carter) reduced the deficit, slowing debt accumulation. Clinton gave us a SURPLUS, so our debt went down from the saved cash.",Gingerstachesupreme,2025-04-14T23:08:33,3
"""Democrat"" is a noun.  Your usage is not as a noun.  You know that, I'm sure, so this is just a subtle barb at Democrats that Republicans use.",oakpitt,2025-04-14T13:23:08,0
Republicans love to act like the north and south didn’t switch. Show them the 1924 electoral map next to the 2012 electoral map and it’s clear.   Maga was still say it’s fake news of course.,clocksteadytickin,2025-04-14T13:38:19,13

"The graphic doesn’t say Obama fixed it, only that he reduced it. Trump had some issues due to Covid as did Biden, while W had 9/11.   The point is more that it’s so frustrating when Mango Mussolini tells his followers he completely fixed the national debt with a magic wand and they *believe* him, blindly, the same way they seem to still believe everyone but Americans has to pay for massive tariffs. I wouldn’t hold Trump’s first term debt increases against him by large if he had tried being honest for once.",LexiNovember,2025-04-14T09:28:38,17
Trump increased the deficit by nearly 40%.  He almost increased it by half!  This happened because of his tariffs policies!  Think it will get better with this term? 🤔  https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-economic-policies-will-increase-us-trade-and-budget-deficits-by-desmond-lachman-2025-02,KFrancesC,2025-04-15T00:17:52,1
