So tonight 9 republican reps will get a stern talking to from president Musk?,Ianthin1,2025-04-01T16:41:17,243
Now go to every news network and repeat it over and over again.  Democrats are for families.  Republicans are against them.  Democrats want you to spend time with your family.  Republicans want to break them up.  Don't say anything else. Repeat it.  Every person.  Every network. If they ask anything else immediately talk about how Republicans don't want families to be together.,Federal_Drummer7105,2025-04-01T16:53:47,393

"Make sure to find the 9 Republicans who did this and call to acknowledge their vote. And I really mean that.  You don't have to pledge loyalty, or pat them on the back, or suck anyone's dick, but this was kind of a big deal. For WHATEVER reason, they're breaking from the hive mind. Of course ream their asses for the bullshit they do. Don't stop calling for the nonsense. But. Positive feedback on the good is not swearing fealty.",IslandFearless2925,2025-04-01T23:41:44,5
