"China said they were the ones contacted for the meeting. Previously they stated that trade negotiations won’t begin until the US lowers the current tariffs. Trump, today, said “no” when asked if he would consider lowering the tariffs. My guess is that China holds firm, as they’ve been insulted and it seems are in a better bargaining position.   If Trump truly is firm on keeping tariffs in place, these negotiations are a ruse, perhaps a desperate attempt for Bissent to mine some hollow victory from them in order to give Trump cover. But why would China help the US here? Why would they help ann administration that has insulted them frequently? We’re about a month away from empty shelves and my guess is that China will use that pressure against Trump. So I believe we’re a cratering stock market away from Trump folding, but not before significant damage is done.",Myrtle_Nut,2025-05-07T15:51:14,6

So when the rubber hits the road in a few weeks what are all the trumpets going to play?  I agree that they will have one choice and that is a fold. But what if they don’t? What happens then?   Where do we land and with how much damage to our bottom lines?,BungleBunny,2025-05-07T21:27:22,1
"Keep in mind that China is afraid of USA. They see Trump and Republicans as dangerous and unstable. China has been working to make itself energy independent and sell solar panels and batteries. Not destabilize the planet.   With the new tariffs China has been asking for clarity and specifics. What is China supposed to be negotiating about? Trump and Republicans never really responded. This is what this meeting in Sweden could be.   >“We’ll see ... we were losing a trillion dollars a year, now we’re not losing anything, you know? It’s the way I look at it.”  Also,   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > ***So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.***  At some point this is going to hit really hard. I think Republicans in the administration are just now starting to have this explained to them. Can't send weapons to Ukraine and Israel if you can't make the weapons. This summer people are not going to be able to buy air conditioners. Or even fireworks.",tech57,2025-05-08T05:18:58,1

No need to be a dickhead. I live in the forest. Fire danger is a major concern especially since there’s no early warning system for me. There’s a fucking reason fireworks are restricted out here during certain times of the year. ,Myrtle_Nut,2025-05-09T15:30:53,1

">I'm not. You just don't agree with me. That's your problem, not mine.  ""You should try it sometime,"" is a dickish thing to say, especially when I had only presented my argument respectfully. I've been around long enough to understand subtext, so let's not insult each other's intelligence. If that's the tone you want, I'm your huckleberry.  >Like I said, I've lived in you area. And other places. I've seen massive forest fires first hand.  You've lived in southern Oregon? There's a pretty big difference in fire frequency in Seattle VS Southern Oregon. Even so, climate impacts have made the entire region hotter and dryer over the past decade--fire frequency and intensity have both increased considerably. In 2020, we saw east-west winds dry out Oregon in the first week of September when a series of fires burned over one million acres. My mom had to evacuate her home and the Obenchain fire came within a mile of her.  But I'm not sure what is even the point of your argument? You've seen fires? congratulations welcome to life in the PnW. does that invalidate the danger that fireworks have in causing fires during restricted timeframes? Fires happen, in the vase majority of cases, as a result of humans interfacing with public forested lands, including using fireworks as I've provided a famous example in a previous comment.  >I've lived in areas where the fireworks are illegal, not restricted. Didn't stop people from driving out of state to go buy them.  What's your point?   I'm referring to restrictions that are enabled to prevent forest fires when fire danger reaches certain levels. For example, it's illegal to use a chainsaw between the hours of 10am-8pm during levels of moderate fire danger. It's illegal to smoke, have campfires, shoot guns, park on the shoulder, or light off fireworks in the forest during high fire danger. These rules exist for a reason and enforcement is taken seriously. But unfortunately, people still ignore the rules and put other peoples' lives at risk because they just wanna have fun.",Myrtle_Nut,2025-05-09T17:15:25,1
