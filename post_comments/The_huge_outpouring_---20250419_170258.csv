Love how his supporters ha e jumped past 'everyone deserves their day in court' straight to 'drop the charges'.   Personally I'd love them to explain why he was carrying a knife in his bag...,Merax75,2025-04-20T13:47:38,12
The victims father seems like a genuinely good person and it‚Äôs disappointing his forgiveness is being met with such indifference or outright contempt.,philthy069,2025-04-19T17:47:47,243

This is the most fucked up stunt for a race war yet. We can all thank soros for taking the wheel on this one.   I‚Äôm curious how the courts will navigate this. I‚Äôm not sure what part of Texas this happened but I would think the rage is bubbling on the side of decency,Imaginary-Alfalfa403,2025-04-19T17:27:42,203
It‚Äôs pretty messed up. I don‚Äôt know why the left so often picks the worst heroes.,skarface6,2025-04-20T02:50:27,35
"Anthony admitted he did it. What part of ‚ÄúI did it‚Äù means ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt do it‚Äù?   What nonsense this is, what Doublespeak!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-20T03:24:41,19
They are literally supporting that terrorist that killed the pharma CEO.,dankhorse25,2025-04-20T00:59:08,37
Not that different than the outpouring of support for a murdering coward who shot a family man in the back because he was a healthcare CEO.,GeoffreyArnold,2025-04-19T21:49:27,46
"The fact pattern is played out daily but asking the hard questions are not allowed.  When you can‚Äôt criticize violence and all the actual issues because they have turned them into ‚Äúculture‚Äú, then there is zero chance of fixing this.",CTSwampyankee,2025-04-22T05:47:12,2
"What did people expect after half of conservatives online, many on this sub, decided cold blooded murder was okay as long as they didn't like the victim (a la healthcare CEO)?",Zaphenzo,2025-04-23T11:08:09,2
This is so disgusting seeing the support for him and the hateful comments people are putting on his donation websites. The whole family is trash,Luna920,2025-04-23T19:35:21,1
"Blind support for George Floyd, Obama, Treyvon Martin, Michael Brown, etc., etc., etc.",truth-4-sale,2025-04-25T11:29:44,1
And asked the police immediately ‚Äúif self defense would hold up as an excuse‚Äù¬†  Which means that his mindset was not of someone who feared for his life.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-19T23:22:37,156

All it takes for evil to prevale is for good men to do nothing.,GiediOne,2025-04-19T22:54:28,12
I fully expect jury nullification to happen. At least 1 not guilty no matter what vote is going to end up on the jury.,Peria,2025-04-19T17:55:36,94
"Collin County is directly North of Dallas.  It's moved steadily left over the past two decades as it's grown. In 2024, it broke as folloes:  Donald Trump  54%  Kamala Harris  43%  Jill Stein  2%",49thbotdivision,2025-04-19T23:13:50,15
Soros could only do those things because conservatives didn't try to stop him. They always could. But the likes of Mitch McConnell only cared about being anti Trump.,dankhorse25,2025-04-20T01:01:01,6
"I don't know if he'll get it for murder, but I suspect there will be a civil suit because he brought a knife to the track meet, and his parents will probably get sued since he's a minor.",atomic1fire,2025-04-20T19:03:47,1

You got that right buddy. But Elon waving is a bridge too far for those people,Help_Me____-,2025-04-19T22:14:00,21
All they need is one juror to have been affected by their shameless media blitz.  It is just a race bait extravaganza and that's all the trial will be about.  He's a cold hearted murderer that should never experience freedom again.,theycalllmeTIM,2025-04-20T09:43:23,65
"Self defense goes out of the window the moment he wasn't being physically assaulted.    Self defense should do nothing for him legally, but I'm worried we have a G.F. situation arising",spezeditedcomments,2025-04-20T11:09:25,13
I get it. But they could still say he is a killer because that's what happened. The only question is if he's guilty of criminal charges.,Juice-Altruistic,2025-04-19T23:07:45,10
He doesn‚Äôt want either side to race bait. I don‚Äôt see the problem. He‚Äôs said from the beginning he doesn‚Äôt want this to be about race.,Mrsmeowy,2025-04-19T23:04:15,116
That may be true but it takes a lot of strength to say he wants to forgive. I do not think I‚Äôm strong enough to do that.,philthy069,2025-04-19T19:36:45,60
"He is a total idiot. Goes up on TV to forgive this kid unconditionally, fails to share the Gospel that he cited as the reason for his forgiveness.

Those were liberals flooding the sub,Luna920,2025-04-23T19:37:01,1
They don't want law.  They just want order (their order).  The reason that we're NOT a direct democracy is PRECISELY because of the anti-collectivist mentality this country was founded on.,bionic80,2025-04-20T10:41:59,6
"yeah but it is about race and if his son were black and got stabbed by a white kid I bet we wouldn't see this same level of ""forgiveness"".",Beware_the_silent,2025-04-20T07:54:55,54
"> He‚Äôs said from the beginning he doesn‚Äôt want this to be about race.  He means he doesn't want it to be about race in *that* direction.  The left, of course, is *eagerly* making it about race, like they always do.",CallMeCassandra,2025-04-20T07:23:08,46
"I do blame the ""right"" on this one. The first time I heard about the story was in terms of racist bait and it literally went down hill.  Now we are here were its just grifting at its highest level. Throw self-defense out the window cause I'm mad. Throw innocent til prove guilty out cause I'm mad.  Why am I mad cause random teens killed another random teen. (Which probably happens a lot)   The grossest party of this story is that its ""national news.""",red-african-swallow,2025-04-20T13:33:59,-5
I certainly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be strong enough to do that less than a month after my loved one was murdered.,tiffanysugarbush,2025-04-19T19:59:13,39
‚ÄúLet him who is without sin cast the first stone‚Äù - John 8:7  He is a grieving father going through something unimaginably difficult. It seems very possible that he doesn‚Äôt know the Gospel or stumbled in his delivery under duress. He may genuinely not want race politics to influence justice.,philthy069,2025-04-20T07:54:23,30
"The jury will be threatened and scared, the judge will be afraid of making the ""wrong"" decision, the town and state will fear the riot to come and it'll be a show trial for pretense and you'll have at least 1 woke white female or angry black juror voting not guilty.   That's just how it is playing out right now. Race is the only factor and nothing else unfortunately and justice will not be blind.",StayStrong888,2025-04-20T00:04:28,41
"I'll do you one better.  If Karmelo Anthony is a white kid, people look at his fancy house and parents high spending habbits and see a priveleged white kid with loaded parents.  A reasonable person still sees it as not self defense, but you add in some affluenza.",atomic1fire,2025-04-20T19:02:28,4
