"This is why the national and political media are at the center of what is happening and allowing Trump and the Putin-controlled GOP to behave as they do. They have steadfastly refused to call out GOP lies and bullshit since they were going after Clinton, and for the past 10 years they have kissed Trumps's ass because the owners of these media outlets want it to happen.  Every fucking headline, every accurate description of a crime committed by the GOP,  is couched in soft and passive language. They will sooner be marched into the camps then actually do their jobs of holding our elected officials accountable.",NorthCoastToast,2025-04-25T19:21:16,19

"If all of Congress sees it, they could grow a spine and do something about it, but they won't. Violating the oath of office (which is an oath to the constitution) is exactly the purpose the impeachment process was created for, and this administration is rife with constitutional violations less than 100 days in.",-CJF-,2025-04-25T19:21:16,3
