"This is one of those questions without a satisfactory answer. Someone would need to try and it would need to go to court to get a definitive answer.  The 22nd amendment states:  >No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.  Ok, so someone can't be elected to the office more than twice. Of note, see the words ""elected to the office of the President"". That wording is a little unusual. Let's put in a pin in that.  The 12th amendment says :  >But no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.  Ah, so a 2-term POTUS is ineligible to to the office of the President! So they can't be VP,  right?  Let's take out that pin from before. The 22nd amendment says you can't be ELECTED to POTUS more than twice. It doesn't say you can't serve as POTUS more than twice. This wording is distinct from the other requirements to be POTUS. For example, the Constitution says if you're not 35, you're ineligible to hold the office of the President. But the wording of the 22nd amendment doesn't say a 2-term President is ineligible to serve as POTUS, just that they can't be elected to the office again.  So technically, based on a plain reading of the Constitution, Obama running as VP then ascending to the office of the President (if the POTUS leaves office) doesn't violate the 12th or 22nd amendments.  Now clearly this flies in the face of common understanding (you can only serve 2 terms!), so that's why there's no good answer. We would need a court to interpret the meaning behind the 22nd amendment to apply only to elections or whether it disqualified a 2 term POTUS from serving ever again.",ProLifePanda,2024-07-30T09:39:01,1
