Parental leave of absence means that they can not vote.  Both male and female should be required to take the leave and that would even out the effect.   They should not be voting because otherwise people who are sick can ask for the same thing.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T16:44:23,1
"Remember, we are living in the cooperation hell. Also, it is just a vote. Speaker Johnsons is trying to do a voting suppression.  Also, they are not the one who inform the companies to return to offices. The cooperations are doing that on their own to find a reason to fire people or make them quit.  If people have a problem, how about the Congress vote by mail. ðŸ˜† Are we going with the fake vote mail next?",kupomu27,2025-04-07T16:48:10,1
The actual fuck rightwingery is that?! Absentee voting is fine. The end.,Relajado2,2025-04-07T16:48:35,1
... and what's wrong with people who are sick still voting?,HorrorBuff2769,2025-04-07T16:51:10,1
"People who vote for election , they are not paid to work in congress.   These people are paid to know what is going on and be present at their job.",AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T17:04:05,1
"If they are sick,  their judgement may be compromised.     Also somebody else can be voting for them behind the curtain and they could be in coma.  If the intention is to allow  for these type of thing, they have to prove who they are and be tested to  prove  that they know the material.    It is a job,  otherwise it will become a joke so they can just take off few minutes a day to vote.",AdSevere1274,2025-04-07T17:01:20,1
