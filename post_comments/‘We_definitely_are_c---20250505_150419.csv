Canadian here who will not be traveling to the US for the foreseeable future. I went down a few times a year and one of those times was to a big event that I will miss. However some of us who went to it have started organizing a similar one in Canada so we can still enjoy ourselves without having to cross the border into a hostile country that apparently disregards our sovereignty and wants to  take us over.,dostoevsky4evah,2025-05-05T18:12:13,6

"> His administration is even spearheading the effort to show all that makes America great by bringing global sporting events, including the World Cup and Olympics, to the USA.”  Who from outside the US is going to want to come and watch the World Cup and possibly end up in torture prison in Central America?   Maybe things will clear up by 2028 for the Olympics, but no way that this will be sorted out by June of 2026.",kiltedturtle,2025-05-05T17:33:51,3

"National parks, basically every place snowbirds go, anything in Alaska, historic sites, ski towns - all in very red areas with few exceptions.   Cities do numbers, but a lot of those are also in red states, so I don’t really care if they’re getting klobbered economically. New York, Chicago, and the like will be fine. Dip in tourism won’t do them any good, but it won’t hit them like one of the towns outside a national park. All in all, I’ll celebrate a downturn in tourism and hope it craters for as long as Trump is president.",Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-05T16:22:59,3

"I'm a Canadian in the US on a TN. I will not be traveling to Canada to visit family because of this exactly. I'm critical of the trump administration and would have to bring a burner phone, which has been sufficient for some CBP to turn away anyway out of suspicion of people hiding things. I would not want any of my friends or family traveling to the US right now. While it's a (hopefully) very low chance of encountering problems with entering, why risk it at all? Especially if you're someone with tattoos or have the appearance of an immigrant or any other characteristics that fit their suspicion rubric.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-05T15:25:02,2
