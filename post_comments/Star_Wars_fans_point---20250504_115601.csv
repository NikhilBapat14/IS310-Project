"So, in the White House tweet they actually say the radical left is the Empire - they‚Äôre making a distinction between good and the evil empire. And then they give him a sith red lightsaber.

"Actually, the crystal that makes up the overall lightsaber is linked with the jedi using it.  Green and blue are the general standards. Each with their own ideas and themes.  Yellow is for the guardians of the temple or holders of knowledge. You see them in the first set of movies.  Then you've got the purple one, which also comes with a backstory of why it's purple for Mace. Which I don't remember offhand.  Then you've got pure white, of Ahsoka Tano's, which is purity.  Then you've got the jet black one of the Mandalorians. Something about that back story as well. Leadership and what not.  Finally, you get to the attuned Red crystals, which resprent all the negative human emotions; Greed, Pride, Self, Anger... etc.  That's why Sith have red ones. The Kyber Crystal is a reflection of the one using it.  Such has even a lightsaber can change its attunement. As of the last canon.  Anyways, Red lightsabers are always a mark of evil, wrong, or being selfish.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-04T16:28:29,5
