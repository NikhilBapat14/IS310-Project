" >Johnson said he was having ""conversations"" with Stefanik and her fellow New Yorker, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., when asked whether he discussed the upcoming gubernatorial election with the two potential candidates.  Stefanik cited a Punchbowl News report on Johnson's comments at the public press conference and wrote on X, ""This is not true. I have had no conversations with the Speaker regarding the Governorâ€™s race.""",Sodola321,2025-04-29T22:03:03,1
