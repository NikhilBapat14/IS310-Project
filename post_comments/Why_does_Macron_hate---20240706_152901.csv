"> but I really really can't see what is so horrific about LFI in the centrist's eyes and it's difficult to work out online. Thank you if you end up answering.  * It all comes from how Melenchon's bad reputation. Melenchon said some ambiguous things related to antisemitism, for example he downplayed how much antisemitism there is in france (""residual""). He used other dog whistle while talking about another politician, saying he was in finance (can't remember exactly).  * Mélenchon is very hot-headed, and generally has a bad reputation for many things, and is generally disliked by most other leftist parties.  * LFI was also absent at a march against antisemitism after october 7.  * The LFI party published a statement on the 7th of october stating they supported palestinians (not the 8th, but the 7th)  * LFI has a EU candidate, Rima Hassan, whose father is in the Syrian air force. She claims there is a genocide in the gaza strip, and she is very pro-palestinian.  * Another candidate made some weird half-antisemitic reference to dragons.  * There is a problematic candidate who seems to praise Islam: Aly Diouara  * Generally, LFI postures a lot, and is hard to negotiate with. Ruffin, a young popular député, recently left LFI because of Mélenchon.  * The left also interrupted several Assemblée Nationale session showing a palestinian flag (which is forbidden).  * Abou Daqqa, a member of the PFLP was invited by a LFI politician, and was expelled from france shortly after october 7, although LFI did not know she was a member of PFLP (still a goof).  I am a leftist but I have to admit that LFI made a lot of mistakes that causes them to be disliked.  It's not that ""Macron hates LFI"", it's just that Macron is center and can make a lot of other allies on the right and the left before he needs to shake hands with LFI.  LFI is ""crazy left"", in a way. The french political ""center of mass"" lean more on the left than other countries. LFI is not a party who can be taken seriously, they are the typical example of the french very divided left.",all_is_love6667,2024-07-07T09:36:41,3
"I think that Macron/Centrists' problems with LFI hang on three aspects. First, its policies are just way more to the left and financially expensive. Second, the character of Jean-Luc Mélenchon seems not very easy to work with. Third, I think the Centrists had hoped the Left would stay divided, so that it would be a clear choice between them and RN, but the formation of NFP has been successful and thus deprived them of that chance.
