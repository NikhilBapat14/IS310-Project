Its amazing to me how Biden can use racist language right out in the open and its crickets on the left.  But when it comes to Trump they need to make up shit to call him racist.,sailedtoclosetodasun,2025-04-16T08:20:14,23
He's already prepping his 2028 run.,DatTrumpDoh,2025-04-15T20:05:53,198
He also remembers the freeing of the slaves after the civil war. Dementia is an amazing thing.,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-15T21:10:08,12
Are these the “poor kids” Biden said were “just as bright and just as talented as white kids?”,Stea1thsniper32,2025-04-15T20:53:41,115

Robert Byrd lives on in Joe Biden. If Democrats were smart they'd keep him in the basement permanently now.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-15T20:14:35,70
Are the D’s still supporting this old man?,MaBonneVie,2025-04-15T20:38:20,12
"The guy is in his 80s. He speaks like someone in their 80s--when he was growing up there was nothing wrong with the term. Yes, Democrats would absolutely assail an old Republican doing the same, and that is just kinda ignorant to how lingo changes over generations.  Plenty to dislike Biden for (like rampant puffery, slander against people, etc.) But this isn't one of them.",whatweshouldcallyou,2025-04-15T21:02:13,-10

*Biden said learning that black children were not allowed to attend public school with white students “sparked my sense of outrage as a kid.”*  And everybody clapped😂  He can't remember last week but he remembers how unique his brain was in 4th grade🤔,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-15T21:17:58,39

"Well, to be fair they probably weren't talking about him specifically. Rather the cadre of puppet handlers who ran the government and controlled the autopen ""on his behalf"".   Must suck not being able to do whatever you want anymore, while the president was asleep most of the day. ",WPWeasel,2025-04-16T17:49:37,1
