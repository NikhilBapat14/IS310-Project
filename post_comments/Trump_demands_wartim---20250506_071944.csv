"Trump's whole schtick is persuading other people to sacrifice things for his direct benefit. He persuades a lot of really, really ignorant or stupid people (yes, I know there is overlap) to sacrifice their self-interests, their money, their integrity, their ability to think for themselves, and even their religious principles - in return for his ever fleeting and perfidious favor.  He is the human embodiment of the ***Golden Calf***. Worshipping such a creature, as many apparently do, is indeed and in spirit, apostasy.",phosdick,2025-05-06T09:25:21,7

"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.

"Part of being rich is having more money than other people.  The other part is others having less than you!  Those may seem the same or similar, but they're two different things.  A rich person obtains and hoards more money and wealth than others, and a rich, politically-powerful person keeps others from obtaining government services.  Common folks pay taxes, but we expect some government services in return.  Nope, not under a wealthy president like Trump!

"They can’t replace taxes because they are antithetical to the stated goals.   If the revenue stream from tariffs replaced income taxes, you would need them to stay on because if you ever stopped importing at the same rate the revenue would drop.   But the government has pretended that the tariffs are only to get better trade deals, which means we would go right back to importing stuff with lowered or even no tariffs   AND they’ve also claimed that the reason for tariffs is to onshore manufacturing which means we’d stop importing stuff because we’re building it here. Again the tariff revenue drops.   The only way replacing income taxes could work is if we continue to import all the stuff we always have but it’s just more expensive because of what amounts to a giant regressive sales tax on consumers which disproportionately affects lower income people, because a larger portion of their income goes to goods.  So they’ll have no choice but to buy less, which will mean we’ll import less and again revenue from tariffs will drop.   It’s stupid and it’s also completely against their conflicting stated goals for doing tariffs in the first place.   And also impossible, which basically makes this “the wall” of economic policy.",specqq,2025-05-06T08:40:29,18
