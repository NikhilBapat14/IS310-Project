"Putin supported intelligent economic advisors to keep the economy afloat. At the time. This administration, not so much.  It may very well be its undoing.  In a nutshell.  The circus isn’t so entertaining when you can’t afford popcorn.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-06T12:30:17,8
"It may end up not actually mattering. One important difference between 2000, when Putin came to power, and today is that, today, the world is awash in mis/disinformation piped through algorithmically driven social media, which has proven to be highly effective at brainwashing people. As long as enough people's feeds are pumped full of sufficient disinformation, it may ultimately end up not mattering if the US economy collapses, especially among the MAGA loyalists who dutifully ignore their eyes and ears when reality contradicts what their supreme leader tells them. Even if the rest of Americans rise up after a complete economic collapse, they'll have to do so against both the MAGA faithful and the world's most powerful military, which the orange fascist has repeatedly expressed a willingness to deploy against the American people.",valamaladroit,2025-05-06T13:21:51,5

Putin pulls a lot of economic shenanigans to scam westerners but the central finances of Russia are actually handled by smart economists instead of whoever kissed his ass recently ,Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-05-06T12:51:03,3
