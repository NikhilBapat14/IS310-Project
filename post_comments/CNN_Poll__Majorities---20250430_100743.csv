"Yes, but crucially, MAGAs really really like inflicting pain on non-whites. For the MAGA men, few things still stir up their Covid-ravaged loins to half-staff anymore, but this performative cruelty does it for them.",localistand,2025-04-30T10:13:18,13

Who answers these polls? I'm opinionated as hell and NEVER answer polls. I'm assuming this are mostly folks that didn't vote for Trump... Or vote at all.,williamgman,2025-04-30T10:18:21,0
"For the vast majority of Trump voters, this election was about one thing: Punching down on marginalized people.  And you are right, it is entirely about sadistic self-gratification.  The point is the pain, the hurt, and the humiliation of the weak.",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-30T10:25:35,4
"Listen, 90 million incredibly well thought out people couldn't be bothered to spend an hour researching the candidates back in 2024 like it had some impact on their lives ever.",dblan9,2025-04-30T10:16:59,1
