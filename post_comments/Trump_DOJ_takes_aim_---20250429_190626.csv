"In 2023 Wikipedia had $250 Million dollars in cash, and it's growing by the day. They are absolutely loaded.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation#Finances  Also, the next time they ask for a donation, keep in mind that they are spending **10 times more on Diversity funding** than paying for their servers. They spent over $30 million dollars on ""Diversity"" lol. It's absurd. Anyone that thinks this organization deserves tax exemption needs to check into a grippy sock facility.   Here's a quick video that explains their Diversity funding:  https://youtu.be/QAoRhUEEtoc",DogsLoveMeCatsHateMe,2025-04-29T20:09:59,11
Wikipedia isn't a church and they certainly don't deserve tax-exempt status. In fact I read an article recently that showed that they are sitting on a giant mountain of cash. And yet they keep getting on their knees and begging for more.,SpecialFree25,2025-04-29T19:29:12,-12

250 million cash thing isn't correct,Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-04-30T03:44:12,31
"False: Wikipedia has moderation staff that can lock down certain wikis to prevent edits and delete edits. They also lean left heavily on the moderation, undoing edits by users who remove bias from pages and banning those users",arbiter_0115,2025-04-29T19:51:22,20
