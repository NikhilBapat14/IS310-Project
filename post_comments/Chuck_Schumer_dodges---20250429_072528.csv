The media always wants to talk about 2026 and 2028 instead of what the Trump regime is doing *right fucking now*.,Just_the_nicest_guy,2025-04-29T07:27:28,22
Impeachment won’t work if Republicans in Congress are still defending Trump at all costs. It is kind of a question without a great answer at the moment.,StormOk7544,2025-04-29T07:35:14,10
Breaking news:  Schumer is not going on record whether there will still be elections in two years. /s,thieh,2025-04-29T07:30:47,8
- waste of time to look that far forward as we have to survive to January of 2027 when new Congress is seated,decaturbob,2025-04-29T07:27:18,3
Schumer acting a lot like he’s a part of the problem right now.,2much41post,2025-04-29T07:40:54,6
So Schumer doesn't think Trump has done enough yet to be impeached?,RoadsideBandit,2025-04-29T10:51:46,2
And this is why he needs to step aside.,whimsicalwonderer,2025-04-29T08:34:10,2
In order to impeach Trump successfully they need super majority.  Last time they tried and failed he just got more popular.,Trugdigity,2025-04-29T08:14:48,2

Why bother to impeach him?  They did it twice already.,TripleDoubleFart,2025-04-29T07:28:53,-1
This is a common sense response. Why would he commit to impeachment now with 2 years before it's even possible.,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T11:16:49,0

"The media is just as bad or worse than the dems with their behavior. They keep acting like this is normal and are still trying to be like but what about the dems .  Idk if they are just too scared of Trump to keep hammering how Trump is  trying to destroy democracy and how bad it is . They don’t have to keep trying to both sides everything.  Trump is trying to say how the media must reveal even leakers and sources identity , they are arresting judges , stripping due process , arresting protestors  this is major .  They need to stop trying to pretend it’s a normal administration doing normal things",Savagevandal85,2025-04-29T08:04:25,3

They do ? It’s just a waiting game ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-29T07:54:05,1
"Yea but it's a real simple question; If we have the power to do so, we will impeach Trump, again.  A hard maybe is a fucking problem when Americans are being shipped off to concentration camps.",No_Anxiety285,2025-04-29T07:39:36,3
No. It means he can't right now. Which is accurate.,AleroRatking,2025-04-29T11:17:15,1
"Because it's a really bad precedent to let Trump get away with being so corrupt, lawless, and inept without any formal reprimand. Yes, we all know Congressional Republicans will never grow balls and put their duty to the country over their own personal political interests, but there needs to be some record of all the ways Trump is violating his oath of office and breaking the rules and norms that have always governed our nation.",md4024,2025-04-29T08:35:44,2
"""Why won't you do anything?""  ""We tried to impeach the prick twice and none of you gave a shit.""",Lord0fHats,2025-04-29T07:35:35,4
"- we need the power to so and the opportunity to do it...and a GOP who actually cares about democracy and todays GOP does not, yet. Impeachment works if its bipartisan....",decaturbob,2025-04-30T05:29:41,1
Right? There should be no hesitancy here whatsoever. Schumer should say that they will hold trump accountable for the crimes he has committed and continues to commit. It's really not a hard question. ,Bakedads,2025-04-29T08:44:21,1
