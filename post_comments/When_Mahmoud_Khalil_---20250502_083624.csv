"That is so grim, as you read it, it just gets worse and worse   > In 2016 three immigrants died in detention within the first six months of the year; a year later, CLIPC was among the top five immigration jails nationally for sexual assault complaints. In 2019 government-oversight agency inspectors at CLIPC found expired and nonlabeled food in the kitchen. In 2023 a 42-year-old Nicaraguan asylum seeker, **detained at CLIPC for an additional seven months after ICE had recommended his release, died after being found unresponsive at the facility.**[...]   >The lights are kept on 24 hours a day, making it difficult to sleep. That’s made worse because inmates, despite having thin mattresses and blankets, are not given pillows. The dorms are kept very cold, a stark contrast to the hot and humid central Louisiana climate. Inmates are afforded three or four hours of outdoor time a day, which they often pass by playing soccer. But the contrast between the 90-plus-degree Louisiana heat outside and the frigid indoor temperatures often leaves inmates reeling. Illness is widespread.[...]    >Some in the Jena facility have been there as long as 16 months; one woman in nearby Basile was stuck in detention over six years, **long after being granted asylum, twice.**",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-02T08:54:21,7
"“And when I was a boy, my dad would tell me that he wasn’t able to be there for my birth because he was away.  It was only when I was an adult that I learned from others that he had briefly been a political prisoner under Donald Trump. “  I hope he can tell the story someday of how his father’s unlawful imprisonment was one of the events that short-circuited America’s fall into fascism. ",mysticrhythms,2025-05-02T08:46:27,1
