"When I was younger, I used to play Football Manager and select my beloved Arsenal. I'd set up a second manager profile to control Chelsea and use it to sabotage their team by blowing their massive transfer budget to buy Arsenal's oldest, worst players for stupid prices. I'd play the first ten or so matches of their season with the goalkeeper up top, their strikers in goal and so on until morale was through the floor and they were in a relegation battle. I'd then retire that manager and win the league with Arsenal in my main profile. I'd do it all again the following season until Chelsea were broke.  Why do I tell this story? Because it feels like Putin is playing Football Manager with Russia as his main team, but with Trump as a second manager profile to sabotage his rival.",Acceptable_Feed7004,2025-05-06T05:25:26,446

This is fucking stupid and will hurt our relationship with Europe, especially Britain and Ireland, even worse.  Those are countries where we have a strong net-surplus in trade.  It doesn't fucking matter if there is a biopharma industry specific trade deficit - that's what happens when geopolitical and trade relationships both have skin in the game.  Furthermore, I've refreshed my knowledge and saw the use of tariffs against China to oppose the fentanyl crisis was already happening and is not leading to productive advances.

"When I was taking estrogen for severe symptoms,  a few years ago, I had to switch to generic.  After that I had bad side effects but one day I got a peculiar bottle that smelled like something I never smelled before. I always paid 100.00 a month for brand in the past.  I tried to take them but it was ugly and chemical smelling.  I tried airing them out, and waiting but it got stronger.  I called the manufacturer Teva and where the address said they came from.  After talking about the complaint and answering a ton of questions, they said something that confused me. I understood they were made in the US, the address is New Jersey.  She almost laughed and said no that is just a port. They, like most meds, are made in India. So if your meds say NJ they are probably from India.  Don't tell me we are going to bring back pharmaceuticals to the US and start paying wages and health care. That would be a hallucination caused by a defective drug which are rarely checked for quality because drugs are checked by the manufacturer and rarely randomly checked by an outside agency. Often when they are checked none contain the right amount of medicine.  Often less then required or even more. Often toxic fillers or carcinogens are included. Not quality made.  So instead of a tariff why don't we hire more testing in New Jersey where drugs are not made but just entering the country.  And please notify the woman in your life she may want to cut her dose in half due to tariffs.

More and more evidence is being discovered that the election was tampered with especially in the swing states.  If he was legitimately elected, there would be enough people to want him in office. The thing is, none of us want him. His polling numbers are the worst since polling began. Wouldn't he be trying to get those numbers up if he actually gives a shit about any of us?   He just needs to leave. Him and this whole cabinet. They need to leave the country during the night and we'll clean up in the morning. They can go to Russia if they want. One could argue that he should stand trial for treason against the country- maybe even war crimes. Is he really worth the effort?  He wouldn't learn anything from a trial. He wouldn't be remorseful. Life in prison wouldn't do anything for him since he'd just find a way to monetize it.

" ⸻  BREAKING: Trump Unveils “TRUMPAMAX” – The Miracle Cure for Everything, Even Bad Hair Days  Mar-a-Lago, FL — In a surprise press conference held on a golden yacht shaped like his own face, former President Donald J. Trump has announced the release of a groundbreaking new medical miracle: TrumpaMax™, a pill he claims “cures absolutely everything—except fake news.”  Flanked by cardboard cutouts of himself in a lab coat (because “real scientists are losers”), Trump declared, “It’s the best pill, folks. The greatest. Doctors are calling it tremendous. Way better than those sad little vaccines. This pill cures everything. Cancer? Gone. COVID? Not even a sniffle. Baldness? You’ll have hair so good, it’ll make Elon Musk jealous.”  The Science Behind TrumpaMax™  According to Trump, the pill was developed using a “very scientific” method that involved blending steak juice, crushed hydroxychloroquine tablets, a splash of Diet Coke, and what he described as “patriot energy.” When asked for clinical trial data, Trump held up a napkin with the word “100%” written on it in Sharpie.  “This is more effective than bleach, and nobody’s gonna be injecting it, folks. That was sarcasm, okay?” he clarified, glancing nervously at a bottle labeled “Ivanka’s Special Immune Smoothie.”  Side Effects May Include Extreme Patriotism  While TrumpaMax™ promises total health, the fine print (visible only under a blacklight) lists possible side effects such as: 	•	Uncontrollable flag-waving 	•	Inability to stop saying “fake news” 	•	Belief that Trump is a licensed medical professional 	•	Spontaneous appearance on conservative talk shows  Critics from the medical community remain skeptical. Dr. Anthony Fauci was last seen burying his face in his hands while muttering “why is this my life.” Meanwhile, the CDC issued a statement saying only: “Please, for the love of science, do not take this.”  Already a Hit at Mar-a-Lago  Despite warnings, TrumpaMax™ is flying off the shelves—mainly at Trump-branded golf pro shops and QAnon forums. Melania Trump was reportedly seen slipping one into her morning tea, possibly hoping it cures long-term marital proximity.  Trump closed the press event by saying, “Look, when I cured polio—I mean, I wasn’t officially president yet, but everyone says I inspired it—I said we need a cure for everything. TrumpaMax™ is that cure. And it’s Made in America—except for the ingredients, which came from a very good deal I made with North Korea.”  Stocks in common sense plummeted immediately after the announcement.",pinoy_dude24,2025-05-06T10:13:25,2

Outside of upgrading to a fancy model here in the UK it's not normal to even see that stuff for sale, I couldn't understand why people who needed that stuff didn't just go to the doctor and get it.

I'm fine with people at that level, $360k, not paying more. But people making way more, should pay more. And let's be clear, the tax cut they're trying to preserve is less than 3%. They'd only face a tax increase of around 3%. It's not some massive number like you probably think it is.   I'm sorry but I'd rather her keep insurance instead of millionaires and billionaires keeping their tax cuts.

"The modern Republican party is built on White supremacy.

"Recently on the news there was a white woman who spat out the hard R towards a black five year old autistic child at the playground for rummaging in her son’s diaper bag. The comments (YouTube, Facebook, etc) are absolutely fucking horrifying. Let’s just say Trump allowed these people to go full mask off towards a small child. This woman played victim and created a “GiveSendGo” where she was rewarded MORE THAN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS by literal out-and-proud Nazis and white nationalists. I am not exaggerating. FULL MASK OFF.  I’ve heard people say that the comments from those who donated on her GiveSendGo were absolutely disgusting as well.  I sent an email to the organization a few days ago to look into her campaign and the evidence provided and so far it hasn’t been removed.  I’d advise you to look into this incident yourself (if you wish) and to see how much this is deep within our American culture where Trump just normalized again.
