"Intentional prosecutorial misconduct.  Wow.  That prosecutor needs to be sanctioned and have his license at least suspended if not disbarred.  That violates constitutional rights, ethics, professionalism - everything.",scrapqueen,2025-05-01T09:53:08,563

They used jail communications     All jail communication is monitored.   This is the defense setting up the prosecution.,Lurial,2025-05-01T11:05:15,-26
If Mangione and his lawyer don't want to be recorded then they should either talk face to face or on a predetermined line that ensures attorney-client priviledge. Which they were able to do and didn't.  *All other calls* a prisoner makes from jail are recorded and this attorney knows it. Maybe why she didn't move to dismiss the case or at the least sanction the prosecution. This is a nothingburger.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T07:36:38,-126

That is a felony charge.,clear831,2025-05-01T15:14:42,140
I would be concerned this was intentional in order to get the whole thing tossed out. See how sympathetic this DA is,RamaReturns,2025-05-01T20:34:03,29
Well it's also the behavior of corrupt prosecutors who intentionally want to throw the case. Make sure to listen to the full call then report it. Yeah ok...,day25,2025-05-01T09:23:27,212

"Cohen testifying is at least a recognized exception... Lawyers aren't supposed to help their clients plan and execute illegal plans...    the shitty thing is they gave him complete immunity, and he admitted to all the illegal activity, and couldn't point to Trump's.  Ah well.",j3remy2007,2025-05-01T09:35:58,45
Calls are recorded with the intent that they will be monitored. Every inmate is told this at booking and intake and reminded every time they pick up the phone. If Mangione wants to talk explicitly to his lawyer he must make that known beforehand.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T08:18:11,-79
That's often true. If you're being mass downvoted you've touched on an inconvenient truth that the left doesn't want to acknowledge. Count on it.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-01T13:30:49,-1
"He also admitted to embezzling 10s of thousands of dollars through invoices to trump. The only way thats possible is if trump did not care about itemizing the invoices from his lawyers, which completely destroys the case against him. Trump cant secretly know that his lawyer was paying off a stripper, if he isnt aware that hes been stealing money from him to begin with.",ultrainstict,2025-05-01T09:55:27,14
Except that's not what happened. Nothing Trump did was illegal and there was zero evidence he tried to plan anything illegal with his lawyer vs. using him for legal services and advice. His lawyer even secretly recorded him and they played it for the jury lol. Where in that recording did it show Trump was trying to do anything illegal with Cohen? Why was that even allowed into evidence? They also used Cohen in the Letecia James trial to talk about his legal advice to Trump and they used other communication with his lawyers in the other cases.,day25,2025-05-01T11:14:20,-2
Thank God he's not a lawyer anymore.,scrapqueen,2025-05-01T09:54:16,2
"All true until the last sentence. What you’re saying about monitoring is all entirely correct, it’s just not relevant to the question at hand - the calls being reviewed by the prosecution.   Yes, calls are recorded with the intent they will be monitored. This does not mean “with the intent they will be given to the prosecution for review.”  A client’s privilege with their attorney is not dependent in any way upon “making it known” that he wants to speak with his lawyer.",MCRNRocinante,2025-05-01T08:22:34,149
If you agree to pick up the phone knowing its being recorded then you dont have privilege.,ultrainstict,2025-05-01T09:58:25,-48
This is one of those arguments where you can tell a person has a hard time understanding an issue unless it’s happened to them personally.  In this country you are innocent until proven guilty. We monitor inmates calls but it’s not given to the prosecution because it would give them an unfair advantage over someone who may not be guilty at all. You have to have consistent laws for everyone for rule of law to be successful. If an inmate is in a situation where they can’t speak to their lawyer face to face (ex: lawyer is unable to make it during approved visiting hours) what would be their recourse? It is important to understand that even if you personally think someone’s guilty they still deserve the right to due process and all the legalities and protections that entails. The reason it’s important is because not every person we arrest and try is guilty and even a guilty person in this country is afforded rights. That’s how we make sure a gov can’t just decide someone’s guilty arbitrarily with no evidence and chuck em in jail,Nyxaus_Motts,2025-05-01T10:32:06,75
I would immediately cede this entire argument if you could provide a source or precedent for that claim.,MCRNRocinante,2025-05-01T10:53:10,6
There is no legal expectation of privacy when you know you are being recorded. This applies to every single person in the united states whether or not you are a prisoner. The legal extent of whats considered private has been adjudication countless times.  He was briefed that the call would not be private and the attorney knows it. What you are saying is to give them special exemptions that no other person has.,ultrainstict,2025-05-01T10:49:09,-35
Expectation of privacy is not the same as privileged conversation. The matter at issue here isn’t privacy - you’d be right f it was. What’s at issue is privilege and the prosecution having access to privileged conversation.,MCRNRocinante,2025-05-01T10:51:34,45
"""New York County Defender Services, the Legal Aid Society, and the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem — had filed “do not record” requests with DOC. Each request listed the phone numbers of their attorneys. DOC was supposed to forward those numbers to Securus Technologies, its privately contracted phone service provider. Securus was then supposed to make sure that no calls placed from the numbers were recorded.""  https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2022/nov/30/new-york-city-jails-admit-illegally-recording-over-2200-attorney-client-phone-calls/   You are wrong. If you want a privileged phone call you must make a request. These calls are not recorded or monitored.   Its the same here in california, tho it must be done each time unlike new york.   ""A ‘confidential call’ means a telephone call between an inmate and his/her attorney which both parties intend to be private… (g)(1)Confidential calls may be approved on a case-by-case basis by the institution head or designee only upon written request from an inmate’s attorney on the attorney’s office letterhead stationery.""  https://capcentral.org/procedures/client_matters/unmonitored_call/  Not every phone call in prison to your lawyer is privileged, and it can and has been turned over to prosecutors, it only becomes an privileged if a request was made and approved prior to the phone call being made.  I dont know if they made the request or if it was granted when the calls were recorded, New York is known for these ""mistakes"", but my point still stands that simply being an attorney call doesnt make it privileged.",ultrainstict,2025-05-01T11:04:12,8
"Well, it appears there is precedent.  The question now becomes, does the letter of the law violate the spirit of the law?  The bloodthirsty out there probably see no problem with this.  For my money, this constitutes an unconstitutional run around of fifth amendment protections.  Unfortunately though, as with many laws, particularly those coming from places like NY and California, until it is contested these constitutional violations are permitted.",Shadeylark,2025-05-01T11:09:21,8

"""because the defendant spoke to his counsel on a recorded and monitored jail line (not a line specially designated for attorney calls) and with counsel using a telephone number that was not identified as belonging to counsel""  I just went and read the artical fully, they had made a request, but did not use the given phone numbers and the call was not made through the confidential phones.   So no laws were broken here, just a case of the lawyer fucking up.   I wouldnt call this unconstitutional, a path is provided for confidentiality. And both mangione and the lawyer failed to use it. Id be shocked if nearly every single state didnt have this.",ultrainstict,2025-05-01T11:13:18,2
"No, again, I acknowledge that no laws were broken.  My point of contention is that a law *should have been broken*.  An unjust law may be legal, but being legal does not make it just.  This whole idea that the prosecution has a legal loophole that would violate the defendant's right to not self-incriminate, via snooping in, without explicitly informing the accused beforehand, on conversations necessary to creating a defense between the accused and his lawyer strikes me as a run around of the most basic premise of the fifth amendment.  Providing ""a path"" is not sufficient, and I don't believe it is in keeping with the intent of the fifth amendment; *the entire protection provided by the fifth amendment is that the state cannot impose its will upon the accused in order to harm the ability of the accused to defend himself.*  **Creating a loophole that permits the state a path by which it may harm the accused's ability to defend himself, by forcing the accused to operate within strictures and guidelines and limitations created by and imposed by the prosecution, violates the most basic principles of fifth amendment protections.**  Forcing the accused to work strictly within ""paths"" defined and policed by the prosecution de facto harms the ability of the accused to defend himself without interference by the prosecution.  Much like how we wouldn't tolerate the state imposing limits on freedom of expression by stating it can only be done in a manner approved of by the state, we shouldn't tolerate the state imposing limitations on freedom from self-incrimination.  Once convicted of a crime, the rights and protections a person enjoys necessarily changes.  But until convicted, an accused is presumed innocent and all their guaranteed rights and protections still apply in full.",Shadeylark,2025-05-01T11:17:12,4
