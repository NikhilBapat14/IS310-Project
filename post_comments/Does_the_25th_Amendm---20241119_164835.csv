"So the immunity ruling is below:  https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/01/politics/read-supreme-court-immunity-decision/index.html  >Why would the courts not sentence a person to prison and issue an arrest warrant if they fail to surrender just because that person holds a political office? I doubt they would hold off on sentencing a sitting member of the House of Representatives or the Senate.  Correct. If you are a Congressperson you can be arrested and tried while in office. However, it is unlikely that standard would apply to a President.  Based on the immunity decision, the majority constantly referenced the need for a ""vigorous and energetic"" executive (this phrase is taken from the Federalist papers, and is taken out of context to come to their conclusion). So the Supreme Court would likely rule that the unique nature of the Presidency, and the fact that they won a national election to serve the nation, would be more important than the ""justice"" of arresting and imprisoning them. They would likely allow prosecution after they leave office, but would rule they must be released to fulfill their Constitutional duties.  >And if the President cannot execute his duties due to being imprisoned, wouldn't the 25th Amendment allow the VP, Vance, to assume the office of Acting President until Trump is released?  If a President was imprisoned, there is nothing stopping them from serving from prison. As long as the POTUS has support of Congress, they could serve from prison, and would likely be given special accommodations to do so.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-22T07:46:27,1
"I thought the immunity decision only applied to ""official acts"" of the office, though, and the hush money coverup would have been pre-inauguration.",Solid_Owl,2024-11-22T10:12:12,1
"It did, but I was lifting some of the arguments they made there as applicable to the question asked. The SCOTUS seemed VERY insistent that our countries laws can't burden the President, as they need to be able to act as President in an energetic and vigorous manner. So there's a good chance SCOTUS would rule that the ability of the elected President to act as President outweighs the justice of the individual serving jail time, especially if it's a white collar crime and not something like terrorism or murder.   Essentially, there's a good chance that the SCOTUS will rule an elected President can't be incarcerated at the federal or state level, and that their election would delay the punishment to better serve the needs of the country.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-22T11:01:06,1
