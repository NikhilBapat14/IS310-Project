This one of the most worrisome things about this regime so far.,5ervalkat,2025-05-08T10:41:01,61
"Excerpts:  Most authoritarian regimes sustain themselves in large part through broad surveillance and tight control of data flows that can feed into systems of semilegal pressure against potential dissidents and opponents. This is something the DOGE team seems to intuitively grasp, just as it grasps that framing this power grab as an immigration enforcement measure‚Äîwhich, to be clear, is not in itself a good reason or a legal defense‚Äîwill ward off public scrutiny. We should not fall for it.  In the targeting of academic institutions, nonprofits, and law firms, the administration has been just as open about the fact that it will bring the weight of the federal government down to bear on those that are advancing oppositional or even just disfavored political agendas. It doesn‚Äôt take much imagination to tease out what form this obsession with regulating acceptable speech and political organizing could take if the Trump team could, with a few keystrokes, pull up a person‚Äôs health records, tax records, business associations, registrations, and so on.  ‚ÄúAI is making it possible to have the sort of surveillance that once was only targeted at political dissidents, the most high-profile government opponents, and to replicate that level of tracking for millions,‚Äù said Fox Cahn, pointing to the manpower J. Edgar Hoover once devoted to surveilling Martin Luther King Jr. ‚ÄúThere were huge efforts to track the members of political dissident groups, and now you can use weaponized tax data to figure out the identities of donors to nearly every major political and social organization in the country.‚Äù",D-R-AZ,2025-05-08T10:18:15,47

"It‚Äôs because this admin is intrinsically linked to palantir, a well known data broker that weaponized data collection to manipulate companies, countries, politics and people.

">When we think about this sort of government data aggregation, the historical precedents are the Japanese internment and the use of computer databases during the Third Reich                      What they're doing with immigrants smacks of the Gestapo, and this data collection puts them on the way to having the ability to set up something like the old East German Stasi with far more advanced technology.

"I dunno.  Yeah,  scary.  On the other hand I am not blowing this off, yet this is just another example of why Trump and Co. don't know what they are doing, and why the GOP needs to seriously be careful with what they wish for (or, allow).    Here is the truth--Trump, Vance, the GOP in general--are betting on a future Dem Admin not using such a system for 'evil'.  As of this moment, they are probably right considering the Dem Party's tendency to take the high road and move on.   Yet, this exact 'system', mega API, or whatever, could also be used to target, and possibly completely end, crypto goons, the Heritage Foundation, Bannon, Musk, Trump and family, and so on.",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T13:21:35,1

"People give AI way too much credit for shit it is not, and can not do.  Do a deep dive and you will see just how stupid AI is ... right now.  Even when it reaches AGI, it's not going to be what most seem to think it will be.   We are already being tracked day and night--have been for decades.  Hell, even Reddit is tracking you (and about 200 cookies, too).  That is way too much data to stay on top of, even for an AI.",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T13:25:19,2

"While I agree with what you're saying regarding tracking, the trump administration is taking and aggregating private data that is generally protected under legislation from commercial use and/or other governmental department use that don't actually have a valid reason for that data. Like for example, health information, mental health history, tax information, donations, social security, etc. There is a lot of data held by government and non-government agencies used to provide services and social assistance that the trump administration just doesn't have a valid need for and shouldn't have. That should worry a lot of Americans, I would be worried if I were american, there is literally zero legitimate reason for these types of data to be aggregated about an individual for government use other than to target and control its population. It's even more concerning considering what this administration has been doing with respect to stripping cybersecurity protections for the country and then building a literal goldmine for identity theft, where you can access and get basically everything you'd need about a person in one spot to steal their identity. It would be a real shame for something like that to get breached and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before that happens.",lana_kane84,2025-05-09T19:14:49,2
