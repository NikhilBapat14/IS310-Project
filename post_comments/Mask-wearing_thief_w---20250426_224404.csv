"An illegal immigrant was arrested Saturday for stealing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s pricey Gucci bag containing $3,000 in cash and other personal items – and a second migrant suspect is still on the loose, according to sources.   Noem, 53, was on an Easter outing with her family at The Capital Burger in Washington, DC, when the masked thief stole the luxury shoulder bag, which also contained her driver’s license, passport, DHS badge and apartment keys on April 20.   The suspect, whose identity was not immediately available, was busted by the DC Metro Police and the Secret Service, sources said.  Crime does not pay, plus we look forward to seeing you in El Salvador after conviction, or before, your choice!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T23:38:46,57
