"Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker used an appearance on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* to come up with nicknames before Trump could think up another weight-based putdown.   The president, [whose feud with the ultra-wealthy Pritzker family runs deep](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-bitter-personal-feud-with-pritzker-family-is-behind-his-harvard-hate-campaign/), has previously poked fun at his foe’s appearance.  “I have two nicknames I could think of. One is, of course, JBurger… because he did talk about me eating burgers,” Pritzker said. “Or this is my favorite, JBeefy.”  [**Read the full story**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jblt-pritzker-and-jimmy-kimmel-spitball-fat-jibes-trump-could-use-against-him/).",thedailybeast,2025-05-02T11:09:42,6
"The media should've been doing this years ago. Instead, they've normalized the idea that Trump gets special treatment: he can crudely make fun of the weight or appearance of others, even as an obese man himself, but no one is allowed to turn it around on him. Even children typically understand that turnabout is perfectly fair play.  What suckers we all are.",Logical_Hare,2025-05-02T11:15:28,13

"I think you misread the title. This is about Pritzker poking fun at himself as in ""here are some dumb nicknames you could use against me Trump"" not Pritzker making fun of Trump's weight/appearance.",Downside_Up_,2025-05-02T11:18:50,11

You should hear what conservatives call the Obama's or Hillary. Not even their kids are immune from attacks about their appearance. Are you old enough to remember what rush limbaugh called a 12 year old Chelsea Clinton?,StewPedidiot,2025-05-02T12:39:41,3

"We do, but whereas you and your braindead friends different from us is that yall lead with denigrating immutable traits and characteristics like skin color or being LGBT.   Our jokes regarding his physical characteristics are always secondary (at best) to us mocking his lies, betrayals, moral and financial bankruptcy, schemes, choice in partners both sexual and otherwise (notice I deliberately didn’t charitably offer the word romantic) …do you get it or shall I continue?",ISeeYouNoThanks,2025-05-03T06:25:18,1

"Lol, what does any of that have to do with anything?  You remember how Trump was best friends with Epstein for years, right? Wished his fixer lady well in her sex trafficking trial? Keeps talking about how a lot of good people are unfairly accused in the Epstein stuff, and suspiciously refuses to release any more information about Epstein's activities, even pissing off some MAGA folks in the process?   You folks hitched yourself to Rapey McGee, who is just another Epstein-esque powerful pedophile and rapist, and you're gonna have to live with that decision, and the judgment of others it brings you.",Logical_Hare,2025-05-02T11:57:03,4
