"Empty words.  Grassley and 18 other GOP Senators, along with only a few GOP House reps could break party lines and impeach+convict this treacherous SOB. But they won't. Because they are unprincipled cowards who value party and loyalty over everything else.",99borks,2025-04-26T11:59:46,554

These conservatives better wake Trump the heck up. He‚Äôs making America look so weak dealing with Putin and his lies. Puppet Trump and Trump is to stupid to act normal.
