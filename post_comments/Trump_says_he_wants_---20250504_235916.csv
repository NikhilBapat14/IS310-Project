"I realized that this argument in favor of sweeping and reckless tariffs that claims the U.S. has been treated ""unfairly"" is just a continuation of Trump's and his follower's persecution fetish, but now on a global scale.  Ever the victim, and always justified in their actions to push back hard against all the scapegoats and evils in the world that are tyrannizing *them*  And what's really frustrating about it is that the United States spent the last several decades making itself the centerpiece of this global trade system, profiting immensely off of it along the way while contributing to world wide disparities in wealth, power, resources and political and cultural capital.   Not to mention that during this time, the U.S. was also asserting itself as the world's globocop and ""liberator,"" further galvanizing America as a dominant world superpower.   So, let me get this straight. We're the victims of a system that we forcibly built and have disproportionately benefitted from at the great expense of hundreds of millions, if not *billions* of others?",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-05T00:42:10,16

I do not believe he is telling the truth from everything i have read China has not come to the table and is ignoring the Trump administration. He is likely saying this to keep the market from dropping offering fake hope to buy time.,sedatedlife,2025-05-05T00:05:06,16

Trump wants a one sided trade deal after poking the bear. China will dig in and can outlast him for as long as it can keep food on the tables.   Trump has to buckle and remove tariffs before Xi will speak to him and even then the only words will be ' Free Trade '.   China is beyond the point of throwing him a bone in order for him to save face.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-05T01:45:50,5

"Canadian Foreign Affairs minister Melanie Joly is on YouTube explaining how it's impossible to negotiate with the trump white house because nobody is authorized or even informed on what trump wants. Only trump can say. And that's a moving target.   This is why the Canadian Prime Minister has to visit Trump in person to try to determine what might fly. Then presumably announce it publicly together so Trump will stick to it, maybe.  Notice on the weekend trump said he's not using military force on Canada. That's because Carney will cancel tomorrow if trump blurts that out.   It's also why China can't make a deal. Xi is not going to visit if the deal isn't already done and he won't be embarrassed.",uniklyqualifd,2025-05-05T11:40:10,1

"They are not ignoring. They repeatedly asked USA to clarify what they want and how they want to do it. Japan was asking the same questions. Meanwhile,  >Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman He Yadong earlier Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing dismissed speculation that progress has been made in bilateral communications, saying “any reports on development in talks are groundless,” and urging the US to “show sincerity” if it wants to make a deal. “The US should respond to rational voices in the international community and within its own borders and thoroughly remove all unilateral tariffs imposed on China, if it really wants to solve the problem,” he said.   China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-05-05T06:25:10,2
Right? Imagine being able to negotiate a trade deal while it’s business as usual in trade otherwise until the deal is agreed upon. Oh I’m hearing that is actually how they’re normally done. FFS the hot mess in charge never stops impressing me.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-05T02:59:53,3

Typical narcissist... Only other countries see his tactics for what they are.  Trade works when both parties get a bit of what they want.  We had a fair deal in CUSMA and that still wasn't good enough.   Certain things he wants from Canada aren't on the table at all. ,Basic_Ask8109,2025-05-05T07:16:49,1
