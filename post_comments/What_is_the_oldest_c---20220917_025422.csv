"Oldest, oldest without merging, and oldest conservative is all probably the British Conservative Party, commonly called the Tory Party. They've been in continuous operation since the 1780s.",[deleted],2022-09-17T13:58:52,9
"Close, but the oldest is actually the Democratic Party in the United States, which has 6 years on the Conservatives.  The Tory party was not really a political party. It was more of a political faction. And regardless, it was consciously replaced by the modern day Conservative Party in 1834. The founders of the Conservatives saw the Tory Party as a losing game and looked to build a replacement.   Meanwhile, the Democratic Party was founded by Matin Van Buren in 1828 as, originally, an organization to send Andrew Jackson to the white house. Though many ideology changes would take place in the almost two centuries since then, the party structure and organization is an unbroken chain from today to 1828.",omgwouldyou,2022-09-19T23:41:53,6

"They did not. Before this was a period where various warlords controlled territory across the country with little-to-no centralized control. Before that was the Qing dynasty, which didn't really have political parties.",[deleted],2022-09-20T05:02:08,3
