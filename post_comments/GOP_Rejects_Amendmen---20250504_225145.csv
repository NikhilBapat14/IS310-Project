"Is this specifically about the case where parents are illegal and kids are US citizens?   If so, devil's advocate I'd argue it's not as black and white of a case as it's being portrayed here. If the parents get deported, then the kids would end up in foster care with a high likelihood of abuse. Even if the parents (most likely from 3rd world countries) get sent back, most parents would rather their kid be with them than the foster care system where they are especially vulnerable, and any parent that wouldn't bring their parents back with them  (unless they are actual fleeing war torn places) vs foster care wouldn't be good parents to begin with (but should own up to raising their kids).   The parents already secured a better life for their children, as when they are 18 and able to take care of themselves they can come back. It's arguably cruel and unusual punishment to send a child to foster care when they have parents in another country (again unless it's a war-torn place or in the case where it's a daughter and the deported country is like Afghanistan).",vancity-boi-in-tdot,2025-05-05T06:25:33,-40

That‚Äôs not how that works. The courts don‚Äôt look at bills or amendments that didn‚Äôt pass committee when making rulings regarding constitutional law.  Dems put it up to force members of the judiciary committee to go on the record against a universally beloved position.
