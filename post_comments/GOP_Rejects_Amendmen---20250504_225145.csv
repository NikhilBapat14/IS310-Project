"Is this specifically about the case where parents are illegal and kids are US citizens?   If so, devil's advocate I'd argue it's not as black and white of a case as it's being portrayed here. If the parents get deported, then the kids would end up in foster care with a high likelihood of abuse. Even if the parents (most likely from 3rd world countries) get sent back, most parents would rather their kid be with them than the foster care system where they are especially vulnerable, and any parent that wouldn't bring their parents back with them  (unless they are actual fleeing war torn places) vs foster care wouldn't be good parents to begin with (but should own up to raising their kids).   The parents already secured a better life for their children, as when they are 18 and able to take care of themselves they can come back. It's arguably cruel and unusual punishment to send a child to foster care when they have parents in another country (again unless it's a war-torn place or in the case where it's a daughter and the deported country is like Afghanistan).",vancity-boi-in-tdot,2025-05-05T06:25:33,-40

That’s not how that works. The courts don’t look at bills or amendments that didn’t pass committee when making rulings regarding constitutional law.  Dems put it up to force members of the judiciary committee to go on the record against a universally beloved position.

"You’ll never get anywhere with that attitude.  But in all honesty, it’s more so to hold those accountable for mid terms and potentially even past the elections.   I think there should be a log of everything happening and maybe someone higher up can use it to look for illegal things occurring or unconstitutional things happening.

"This is a microcosm of all dumbest shit the democrats do that lead us here. When dems have control of congress ( with or without the presidency ) suddenly they have 1000 things to do other than legislate, they suddenly have 50 different reasons that can’t vote on any bills and 2 different beuracrats to tell them that the existence of a single republican means we all have to just go home.  However when republicans are in control of congress and the White House and dems have the chance to push a “symbolic bill” that everyone knows the outcome of it’s all hands on deck. This is why the republicans and Trump won. THIS IS BILL IS NOT A VICTORY. While dems are snickering about how republicans are openly for authoritarianism, republicans are gonna keep dismantling stuff. We need effective, organized, and methodical TOTAL RESISTANCE.
