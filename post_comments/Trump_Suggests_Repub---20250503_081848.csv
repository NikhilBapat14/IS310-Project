"Democrats should be forming a shadow government.  There should literally be a press conference held every single time they say or do anything, and it should look just like nazi Barbie's WH briefings.  Same spot and same person every time.  They need to set up their own briefing room.  Call them out on everything.  Every time.  Discuss any and every action that can be taken.  Keep people informed from the left, because right now they're doing a shit job and people are desperately waiting for something.  I mean why does everyone but the Dems see that they need to just show up more for the people at this point?",redbanner1,2025-05-03T09:16:30,257

They have lost everything, especially their minds! These Radical Left Lunatics are into the ‚ÄòImpeachment thing‚Äô again. They have already got two ‚ÄòNo Name,‚Äô little respected Congressmen, total Whackjobs both, throwing the ‚ÄòImpeachment‚Äô of DONALD J.

"Schumer used to be, and maybe still is, a good communicator.  His problem is that the methods of communication have changed, but his methods have not.  Whitmer's brand is 'working with the other side'.  It is who she is and she should own it. She's a solid centrist, anyways.  But, she represents Michigan -- the home of Nugent and Kid Rock and 100 militias and 1,000s of blue collar auto workers.  Remember during Covid when armed men 'protested' outside of the Statehouse looking like they were about to invade a country, all because they couldn't sit their white trash asses down on a bar stool and drink shitty beer?  Yeah, that is who she represents so cut her some slack.  And yes, I am fully aware that there are plenty of good people in Michigan, too, so just paining the picture.  Even Slotkin is threatened by militias on a regular basis.  The only thing Dems can do, whether in Congress or in another position, is to simply do their own thing and fight it out.
