"Yang is on Fox News talking about Democrats.  Both his approach and motives are suspect.  Besides, Fox News should be more concerned about how they are going to spin the current crap fest to their viewers who increasingly disapprove of Trump and the Republicans who prop us his diapered ass.",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-28T18:14:22,20

"Yang was a single policy candidate, trying to push that single data issue into a fantasy campaign promise.  I like the guy. I think he's intelligent, articulated and energetic. He helped me understand the importance and value of my online data, and how our collective data is incredibly important to the economy.  I still agree that we need to tax the collection of consumer data, and I believe that tax generated from our data should be returned to us.",Mammoth_Royal_2400,2025-04-28T18:34:27,2

Yang was able to get people to listen to his message so yea i do not think he is really tuned into what democratic voters want.,sedatedlife,2025-04-28T19:43:11,0
Fox benefits from the Yang Gang cult splintering the opposition along with Stein/Greens and the other one.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T18:19:27,7

"I know you're being a smart ass but that might be the dumbest thing I ever read.  Propaganda is literally just a means to get people to agree with you, true or not.  You calling what they said propaganda is, ironically, propaganda.",trollsong,2025-04-28T19:39:42,-4

The dude's username tells you all you need to know.  Anyone who would equate persuasive speech with propaganda neither knows nor cares about either.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T22:21:12,1
">Words have meaning, homie  Words have history too, homie.   >Not everything meant to persuade relies on emotions to incite and there's a distinction between the two.  Yea, homie, we wouldn't want to talk down to people we disagree with, homie.  But sure, add more condescension. I'm sure that will prove you aren't being emotional about the defentioon of the word propaganda.  Like I said the history of how the words defention has changed.  Look up Edward bernays and the center for public information ww1.   >Not everything meant to persuade relies on emotions to incite   And not every human is swayed by facts and logic. Hence, an emotional plea may often be needed.   See facts and statistics of climate change versus a picture of a stranded polar bear, etc.   But seriously look up Edward bernays, watch century of self, and possibly read his book propaganda.  He actually hated that he helped make it a bad word.  To be used in a similar fashion as an ad hominem.   At the end of the day propaganda is just ""how do I get you to believe and accept my take""  Be it through hard facts, emotional manipulation, straight up lies, insults, or a mixture of them all.",trollsong,2025-04-28T23:11:12,0
"That's... Not what propaganda means at all.  > Propaganda (n): information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view  To call opinion, persuasion, and rhetoric propaganda is to undermine actually debate. You're taking the most harmful subset and casting it to the general  concepts in order to defend bullshittery.  This behavior of justifying the worst with broad reinterpretation is itself misleading and, ironically (as you say), actually propaganda by definition.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T23:58:23,1
">This behavior of justifying the worst with broad reinterpretation is itself misleading and, ironically (as you say), actually propaganda by definition.  Go look up WW1, Edward Bernays and  and center for public information.  The broad reinterpretation happened then.
