Give him time to get his marching orders from Trump/Putin.  Tillis folds nearly every time.,Stranger-Sun,2025-05-06T10:02:12,24
"Didn’t he say the same thing about the drunk at the Pentagon that he ended up confirming? Good on him if he follows through, but forgive my skepticism for the time being. Republicans tend to fall in line.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-05-06T10:02:23,16

Thumb Tillis is full of shit. He will quietly fold on this principled stand — mark my words. He’s reliably craven.,dietTAB,2025-05-06T10:32:18,9

"> ""Tillis told reporters Tuesday morning that he will not support Martin’s nomination to remain as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia because of his advocacy for people convicted of Jan. 6-related crimes.""   The crimes that Tillis's orange god pardoned?  >“If Mr. Martin were being put forth as a U.S. attorney for any district except the district where Jan. 6 happened, the protest happened, I’d probably support him but not in this district,” Tillis told reporter.  So he's totally fine with Martin being a U.S. attorney. He just doesn't want it to be DC.  Tillis will 100% change his vote and support Martin.",captaincanada84,2025-05-06T15:34:51,2
