Harvard can probably scrape together some cash.,30mil,2025-05-03T15:09:53,518
"Snippet:  >Senior members of Harvard University's faculty are pledging to donate a portion of their pay to the school as it opposes the demands of the Trump administration.  >The announcement comes after the Trump administration froze more than $2 billion in federal funding for Harvard University. The school filed a lawsuit in response.  >In a letter posted online, organizers asked senior faculty to commit 10% of their paycheck for the period of a year or until the funding situation is resolved.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-03T15:02:33,69
Anything that anybody and everybody can do to stand up to this bully is a good and positive action.,BioticVessel,2025-05-03T15:07:29,86
Gonna take a lot more than 10% to counter the funding loss from our butt hurt POTUS.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-03T15:30:25,42
"I think something that some people are missing is the type of person who is a senior member at Harvard. These are people who could retire today and be fine. They aren‚Äôt being hurt by this, Trump isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwinning‚Äù because of this.   These people are heroes already, as they are spending their life advancing human knowledge rather than just retiring when they have enough money to do so. They‚Äôll be fine, and this is the kind of pushback that can inspire others, be meaningful where it matters, and make Harvard look like the university they‚Äôve billed themselves as for 200 years.",ExtraPocketz,2025-05-03T23:17:08,15
Surely Harvard can liquidate some of its endowment to weather this storm?,Thunderstarter,2025-05-03T15:19:33,28
"Well, that's ridiculous. The faculty should keep their money.  Let rich alums and parents of students donate.",bedofhoses,2025-05-03T19:13:09,9
"By hurting these people in their pay, Trump‚Äôs has already won.  Not like anything is coming out of his pocket to pay for legal costs, even if they won back their lawyer fees.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-03T15:22:24,11

"How about cutting the pay of all of the unnecessary administrators instead of the people who actually work for a living, Harvard?",Zahgi,2025-05-04T08:36:09,2
This is cringe. Harvard has an endowment of 53 billion dollars. Literally use that. Don‚Äôt punish professors/lecturers who already don‚Äôt make enough.,aboysmokingintherain,2025-05-04T00:49:30,4
This is like a church losing tax exempt status. Havard has one if not the largest endowment funds in the world. They are fine. I don‚Äôt agree with it necessarily because it feels wrong how trump targeted them and I hate everything else he has done for the ‚Äúcommon man‚Äù. But if you have a 50+ billion endowment and 80%+ alumni with a million net worth it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. It‚Äôs a personal vendetta and publicity stunt to appeal to people who didn‚Äôt get into college.,GurSea2007,2025-05-04T03:28:57,2

Doesn‚Äôt Harvard‚Äôs endowment have like 10‚Äôs of billions of dollars? Pretty sure Harvard is going to be fine without the government‚Äôs money.,lsthislegal,2025-05-03T23:19:23,-2

"Agreed, but every bit helps.  I also think this act will bring Harvard faculty/staff/students together and raise their morale, as well as other universities who may be targeted by Trump, or who have to fight to protect their free speech.  At least I hope so....",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-03T15:41:27,36

"Comments like yours is why Trump can/will erode America.   It‚Äôs just not about this year or next. It‚Äôs a fight for all schools and organizations, especially the ones that don‚Äôt have billions of dollars in endowment. If Harvard folds, everybody will fold.   On a side note, all the elite schools should be pooling resources to fight Trump.",Skinnieguy,2025-05-04T01:09:20,13

"Kind of.  Much of the endowment is money donated for a specific purpose, so they can't just spend it however they want.",i_am_a_real_boy__,2025-05-04T06:39:39,3
Should just refuse to pay - given Trump can‚Äôt just take away their tax exempt status.,7148675309,2025-05-03T23:01:47,14
