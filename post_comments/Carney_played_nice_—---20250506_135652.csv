"Carney did what he had to do. You don’t “deal with” Trump by getting into a verbal slug fest. His whole schtick is to goad and prod until he gets a reaction. The real discussions are happening behind closed doors and all Carney had to do was to not allow Trump to get under his skin.   Plus, Trump seemed to not really understand what he was doing there. He barely even spoke about Canada for more than a minute or two.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-06T14:02:01,164

"I actually disagree that Carney played nice or that he only survived by the skin of his teeth.   I also think the author underestimates Carney. Is he an economist? Sure. But he can also be pretty snarky when he wants to.   Trump was meant to take the comments as flattery, naturally. However, anyone picking up on the subtlety of his comments would understand they were insults.  The ""owners of Canada"" comment referring to Canadians was one. Same with his comments about Trump revitalizing NATO. Anyone who sees Carney as a flatterer is missing the subtext.",alisonds,2025-05-06T19:41:10,19

"Trump was a childhood bully who was made worse by the father who he admires.  He has no social graces.  He babbles about ridiculous crap because he is unintelligent and insecure, but is using dominance tactics in an attempt to hide it.  You can see in these various meetings with foreign leaders that he is usually awkward and out of his element.  At the G7 summits, he looks like the kid who is ignored at playtime  He can relate to someone like Bukele, who shares his authoritarian attitudes.  He admires Putin, who he aspires to be.  But he is not fond of leaders of other western nations because they look down at him even though he perceives them as  being weak.  You can't deal with him as you would a normal politician or leader.  The best move would be to avoid meeting with him altogether, especially on US soil as that makes him feel as if he is winning.  Leave it instead to more junior people to handle it behind closed doors.  Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly worked as Trump's communications director, had good advice that supported Carney's earlier stance of taking a hard line.  Carney should have stood his ground:  >Scaramucci: If you and I got in a room and said ""Okay here's what we need to do, let's see if we can dismantle the world's trading system, weaken the United States and let's see if we can disenfranchise ourselves from our European allies and other nations where we had strong reliant partnerships, and let's see if we can help the Chinese and the Russians,"" I don't think you and I could have come up with a better plan...  >This is an American Brexit... If he (Trump) wanted to solve a problem you certainly would not handle it this way with this level of hostility  >*Presenter: What in a nutshell would be your advice be ...to those overseas leaders who are sort of queuing up, trying to get Donald Trump on the phone? What should they be saying in a nutshell?*  >Scaramucci: I wouldn't be calling him, actually.  >*Presenter: We're told they're calling him. What should they say to the president?*  >Scaramucci: **My advice to them is hang up the phone.** Stop calling him and let this thing ride itself out because he's going to be forced to capitulate. The market and the American people are going to force him to capitulate. Think like Prime Minister Carney. **Don't let the guy bully you.

An announcement about a “really, really positive” thing “about a certain subject, a very important subject” coming “on Thursday or Friday,” and, like all the other digressions, absolutely nothing to do with Canada. “I’m on the edge of my seat,” Carney replied, to laughter in the room, when Trump made that particular aside.

"This is why Xi did not go to Trump's inauguration and has not talked to Trump since he's been in office.    Xi has a plan for retaliating against Trump’s gamesmanship   https://archive.ph/0s5OX#selection-2413.0-2417.304   > Many Chinese argue that Xi is stronger politically and the economy is more self-reliant and resilient, even amid recent challenges. Chinese analysts view the US economy as more fragile and American politics as deeply divided. Geopolitically, Beijing sees US influence as declining throughout the global south and Asia — and support for China’s vision as rising.  >  > Xi has already signalled that he will treat his ties to Trump as a purely business relationship, albeit Don Corleone style. He won’t personally embrace Trump and will retaliate early and hard in order to generate leverage. Beijing in effect rejected Trump’s invitation for Xi to attend the inauguration.  >  > Hence Xi’s four “red lines” at a November meeting with President Joe Biden in Peru in a clear message to the incoming administration.   >   Xi tells Biden he will work with Trump to manage US-China differences   https://www.ft.com/content/810aa0a8-6365-4876-bbd3-ea178b7f7ae9   https://archive.ph/QF7Jc   > “‘Small yard, high fences’ is not what a major country should pursue,” Xi told Biden.   >  > ***Beijing’s planned responses to Trump fall into three baskets: retaliation, adaptation and diversification. Mirroring US policies, Beijing in recent years has created a range of export controls***, investment restrictions and regulatory investigations capable of hurting US companies. Beijing is unable to match tariff for tariff, so it will seek to impose costs in ways that inflict maximum pain. For China, failing to retaliate would signal weakness domestically and only encourage Trump.  >  > In late 2024, Xi also participated for the first time in meetings with the heads of 10 major international economic organisations. His message was clear: China will be the leading force for global economic stability, prosperity and openness, and opposes all forms of protectionism.  >  > Much could go wrong. Beijing’s confidence is matched by the Trump team. Both sides believe they possess the upper hand, can impose more costs and withstand more pain. The stage is set for a complicated, destabilising dynamic which, at best, results in a ceasefire. And that’s only on economic issues, not on Taiwan, the South China Sea, tech competition or nuclear force modernisation. The cold war is starting to look quaint in comparison.   But Xi did send Trump a message,      China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > ***So here we are.

Precisely! Anyone with a good grasp of the English language could tell that it was just one back-handed compliment after another. He’s not only economist smart but socially intelligent as well.

"Every Canadian on reddit has this horseshit take. Trump isn't a traditional politician, you need to make some waves if you want to get through to him. Let him have a freak out on live TV instead of his nonsense word salad. If you do that at least business community leaders will be in his ear afterwards, as opposed to this chucklefest that will be completely out of the news cycle by end of day.  As it is Carney laughs along to Trump continuing to threaten our nation, while corporations continue to cut Canadian jobs.

">Trump isn’t a traditional politician   Duh. That’s why you let him scream himself out before allowing him to use you for a sound bite. Look at Zelenskyy. His whole MO is to goad, provoke, jape, and troll. The only thing Carney had to do publicly was to be outwardly inoffensive.   That’s it. Carney isn’t going to do anything for Canada in these public facing meetings. They aren’t for Carney - they’re for Trump.

Trump has to cave or he will create such a large economic disaster that he won't make the end of the year.  He will get impeached when Congressional stock portfolios lose 60% of value.  The reason there's only smaller demonstrations is the economic pain is lagging.",beekersavant,2025-05-06T16:52:23,5
"Trump is a narcissist, a bully and an idiot. You don't win with him by getting into an argument or showing him to be the idiot he is because he has shown his vindictiveness is stronger than his understanding of consequences.  Getting a win over him in a public argument just makes him pull ridiculous stunts like 145% tariffs that hurt everyone but he doesn't care about that. He'll happily fuck over America if it means he can get a little vengeance.  The only way to actually win with him, play nice in public, suggest negotiating a deal and fucking destroy the incompetent back room negotiators who will except anything they can call a deal that Trump will claim is ""the best deal, the greatest of all time"" regardless of its content.
