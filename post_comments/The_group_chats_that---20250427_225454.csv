"A lot of interesting bits in the article, but overall picture is that Andreeson and and a other VCs involved aren’t really different than NEET kids who got radicalized online and now spend 20 hours a day posting",dangubiti,2025-04-27T23:20:24,13
Pretty horrifying picture painted in that article. Certainly explains a lot about the coordinated-seeming shift to the right by the tech bros.   >Rufo had been there all along: “I looked at these chats as a good investment of my time to radicalize tech elites who I thought were the most likely and high-impact new coalition partners for the right.”,Enibas,2025-04-28T00:39:05,6
"The stand-up comedians are right; no one uses the phone in our cellphone. Everything is chat.  Which makes sense. We enter into chat rooms or threads, what have you, to see what everyone else is talking about and to add your own two cents. And then it's up to you if you're still interested in following along. It's both impersonal and self-centered.   And this is what hate speech and darker thinking occurs because we dropped the personalization from our conversations. We don't face each other. We don't tacitly agree on the give and take from conversing. We just type, type, type away.  So the wealthiest among us have their own private chat rooms. It makes sense. Before this it was the board rooms, executive floor, the country and social clubs. All to give the elite a safe space to discuss their abhorrence of whatever societal topic that they felt needed to be addressed.   But we now know this is an echo chamber which devolves into unhealthy attitudes and a skewed thinking of reality.   But this is the billionaires' chat rooms with multinational influence and reach. If they decide that they don't like something, plans and actions can be put into play immediately and equally fast results. The only hope we have is in illuminating these dark corners so that everyone can see what is going on and can stand up to these individuals with the strength of numbers.",1970s_MonkeyKing,2025-04-27T23:33:06,6

"> This man should be much busier than I am but he is on 100 of these group chats. Where does he find the time?  My father has a group chat with his golf buddies, this lad shapes global investments and policies.  Both are equally retired in practice.",Logseman,2025-04-28T15:30:45,1
