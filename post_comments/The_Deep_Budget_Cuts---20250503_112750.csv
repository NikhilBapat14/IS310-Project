"These should not be framed as ""budget cuts"" because they're simply taking money from services that benefit all of us, and turning them into tax subsidies for the rich.   If you do that you're not ""cutting the budget"" because that money isn't going to services, it isn't going to the tax payer. It's redistributing your tax money from things that benefit you into the pocket of rich people.  It's one of the most obvious and transparent scams going and the fact so many working class people fall for it is a tragedy of modern education.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-03T11:45:18,20

Isnâ€™t the rationale given for his turning his back on the world and angering all our allies that he was shrewdly forcing them to pay more for their own defense and security so we could pay less? Didnâ€™t he proudly eliminate all US aid to foreign countries so we could spend more money on problems at home?  Guess not.,survivor2bmaybe,2025-05-03T12:16:46,4

"Definitely, these budget cuts are gonna hurt a lot of people who rely on government programs. It's sad to see priorities shifted away from things like education and healthcare. I really hope people speak up and push back against this.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-03T13:29:28,1
55% cuts to EPA. Why in the world does the Trump administration want to destroy the planet so much?,objectivedesigning,2025-05-03T20:24:53,1
"*From Bloomberg News reporters Jennah Haque, Mathieu Benhamou, Dave Merrill*      President Donald Trump envisioned a drastic remaking of the US government inÂ his budget request, dramatically curtailing domestic agencies, while boosting theÂ military and border protection.  The White Houseâ€™s fiscal year 2026 preliminary budget would cut discretionary spending by more than a quarter in five cabinet departments, while increasing the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s budget by nearly 65%.  The proposed budget â€” which rarely becomes reality â€” effectively serves as a vision board for what Elon Muskâ€™s Department of Government Efficiency could do if they had free reign to slash federal spending.
