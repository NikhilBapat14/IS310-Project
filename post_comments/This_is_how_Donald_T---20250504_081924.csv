"This tariff war seems thrown together and improvised. All itâ€™s succeeded in doing is drowning the markets in uncertainty and alienating allies all while forcing them to consider China as an alternative.   I thought all the tariffs talk was just a ploy for leverage, but the longer this goes on, Iâ€™m convinced he actually thinks tariffs (as a long term tax) are a great revenue generator. A stupid leftist idea, and weâ€™re seeing the fruit of this ignorance play out in real time.",Everlovin,2025-05-04T11:03:17,28
"However, this tariff threat has at least succeeded in bringing other nations to the negotiating table â€“ and now, the best way to restore calm is by letting Trump do what he does best: negotiate.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T08:52:59,-34
"I guess the Founders were socialists then because until Income Tax, the Government got its money from Tariffs from overseas and from interstate tariffs.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T18:11:43,7
"A stupid leftist idea? The tariffs can literally replace income tax. It's a form of sales tax, with large corporations footing a huge chunk of the bill, something everyone always wants.  It's a brilliant idea. Some of you are bothered by the fact that his plans are not detailed in advance for you. Maybe he doesn't think that tipping his hand with every intention he has so that you can feel better about it is whats best for those plans? Some things have to be kept close to the chest and only revealed once others respond the way he hopes/intends. He has a plan, and I'm happy to let it play out, and see how it works.  So many of you complain about shit, but never want anything to actually change. You all just want status quo. I want someone in the White House who actually forces radical change, so we get to see if it works or not. If it doesn't, it can be fixed later. But let's see.",North_Moment5811,2025-05-04T12:11:08,-8
"After four years watching Biden fail on every promise and spout Trump hatred, Iâ€™m reveling in anticipation of what Trump & Co. will do next.  Biden seldom spoke to the American people and when he did, it was usually embarrassingâ€¦ Trump has done more in 100 days than Biden did in 50 years.   Still, almost 4 full years to go!",BerniWrightson,2025-05-04T09:20:06,-4
Tariffs cannot replace income tax. Itâ€™s mathematically impossible under any reasonable assumption of elasticity of demand. See analysis from [PIIE](https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2024/can-trump-replace-income-taxes-tariffs).,zip117,2025-05-04T17:57:07,17
Tell me you don't understand economics without telling me you don't understand economics.  Corporations effectively pay 0% in taxes because they build them into their cost structure and therefore pass them along to their customers.,Silly-Safe959,2025-05-05T18:04:44,-1

"You sound like you're 14 to be completely honest. They pay 0 tax by minimizing profit. You can't pay tax on profit that doesn't exist. It's very easy for a large corporation to reinvest revenue and minimize the amount of money taken as profit. It has nothing to do with ""build them into their cost structure and therefore pass them along to their customers"". That isn't even a coherent thought. Give it a few more years before you participate in adult discussions.",North_Moment5811,2025-05-06T11:16:45,1

"You sound like someone that's never worked in contracting. I have,  and costs are absolutely built into our fee structure.   We're doing it right now.  Technically we're both correct with how they address it (two strategies), but only one of us is being a childish insulting ass about it. ðŸ˜‰",Silly-Safe959,2025-05-06T16:48:20,0
