"What’s really stupid is that clean energy is the future. We are running out of oil and the effort to extract the remaining non-renewables is becoming too expensive, so even the big oil companies are throwing their lot in to get ahead of the market. These efforts by trump are just cruel, stupid, and spiteful, much like everything in his administration.",QuarkGuy,2025-05-02T16:34:00,4
"Trump is also a big blow to progress, prosperity, and the rule of law. We're at a point where he is the only one in America benefitting from his administration. Every sector and every individual has it worse because of him.",Nerd_interrupted,2025-05-02T16:35:11,4

"President Donald Trump proposed drastic budget cuts today that could stymie green energy projects, gut environmental protections, and further hobble health and climate research in the US.  Topline budget proposals released today for the 2026 fiscal year would ax $15 billion in federal funding for renewable energy and new technologies to capture carbon dioxide emissions. It would strip nearly $18 billion from the National Institutes of Health, while the Environmental Protection Agency would see its budget slashed in half.  All in all, it’s yet another wrecking ball aimed at federal agencies after Trump and billionaire-crony Elon Musk swiftly moved to layoff thousands of government employees and defang regulators charged with protecting Americans’ homes, health, air, and water. The proposal also reads like a tirade against civil rights and any solutions for combatting climate change.
