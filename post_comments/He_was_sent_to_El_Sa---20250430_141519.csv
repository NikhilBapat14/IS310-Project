"Absolutely disgraceful and heartless!!  Snippet:  >""The child's father, Maiker Espinoza-Escalona is a lieutenant of Tren De Aragua who oversees homicides, drug sales, kidnappings, extortion, sex trafficking and operates a torture house,"" DHS said in a statement over the weekend. ""The child's mother, Yorely Escarleth Bernal Inciarte oversees recruitment of young women for drug smuggling and prostitution.""  >**""The child remains in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement and is currently placed with a foster family,"" DHS added.**  >Inciarte, her attorney and the family deny the accusations by DHS.  >""If it's true, release the evidence,"" Inciarte told ABC News. ""Release the proof that we are Tren de Aragua. They took a child away from their mother and they're telling lies about us.""  >According to Inciarte, she and Escalona were never released from detention in the U.S. A DHS document obtained by ABC News shows that Inciarte entered the U.S. on May 14 and did not present a valid entry document.  >**Venezuelan documents provided by their family appear to show the two do not have criminal records in their home country.**",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T14:16:38,37
I wish there was a way to get MAGA to empathize with this. They’re absolutely horrible people that are doing this all while painting these individuals as criminals.,hmr0987,2025-04-30T15:11:06,16
"The chances that Homeland Security are being honest about why they were deported are pretty close to 0. They've never been a particularly sentimental organization, but now they are just gleefully ruining as many lives as they cross paths with, and boasting about their evil on their FaceBook Propaganda page to impress the racists and scare off the rest of the world from ever coming here.",RealGianath,2025-04-30T14:43:31,11
Glad they are deporting these murdering people,galtoramech8699,2025-04-30T17:33:03,-14
"I think what bugs me the most about all this is I never know who to believe. Is there proof of them committing these crimes? If so, where is it? I don’t want criminals here, but can I trust that the ones they’re deporting are actually criminals?",NoneOfThisMatters_XO,2025-04-30T14:32:50,17
">Inciarte's family previously told ABC News they believe the couple was accused of being members of Tren de Aragua [**because of their tattoos**](https://abcnews.go.com/US/family-venezuelan-migrant-recently-el-salvador-american-horror/story?id=120381541)**.**  >Recent Stories from ABC News00:0002:00Read More  >""My daughter has a tattoo of the year I was born and the year her dad was born,"" Inciarte's mother told ABC News. ""She also has the name of her son and some flowers on her chest.

"Me, too!!  I was just ""researching"" empathy and how it must feel to not have any.  And, people of all kinds don't have it as it must be taught at an early age. Yes, some are born with it, but most have to learn. Also, it's not just those on the right. And, I know many will disagree, but I know there are ""old time"" conservatives (has nothing to do with age) who are NOT as horrible as MAGA, and I ""want"" to think some of them do know how wrong this is!  At lease I hope so:(",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T15:23:14,3
You can’t change Evil. All you can do is rally and fight back. And Americans have started fighting back.,candycrushinit,2025-04-30T15:24:45,0
Really? You *don’t* believe this 25 year old man is a drug lord human smuggler who operates a torture house?,Nice_Marmot_7,2025-04-30T16:52:39,4
These people are most likely innocent. Not that you sadists care.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-30T18:50:13,5
"If you're spending any energy or time at all, like literally even a fraction of a second, thinking that the Trump administration may be telling the truth I have a bridge to sell you.",uhohnotafarteither,2025-04-30T14:59:39,15
"> I never know who to believe.  Well, one of the two parties is a group of people who lie constantly and about everything, who think trolling is the same as governing, and who are basing all of their decisions on how they can cause the most pain.  The other party could be a Greek carpenter offering you a cool new horse with giggling sounds coming from inside and spears sticking out of the top and they would *still* be by far the more credible of the two.",DaveChild,2025-04-30T14:46:43,34
"And, that's the big issue! Because they've (Trump, etc.) have lied so many times....  From the article: ""*Venezuelan documents provided by their family appear to show the two do not have criminal records in their home country.""*  BUT, **my first thought** after reading about their alleged criminal activities: The little child is still ""their"" child. And, if they are being deported because they are not U.S. citizens, then let them take the child with them! THIS is not the way! ☹*""The child remains in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement and is currently placed with a foster family,"" DHS added.""*",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T14:38:03,14
"Yeah, it’s called Due Process",candycrushinit,2025-04-30T15:23:17,6
This is the  reason that we have due process for the accused.,batmanscodpiece,2025-04-30T15:44:45,7
The other problems is the government people doing the deportations are committing crimes too. So we as Americans are asked to believe government employees that commit crimes in arresting immigrants are credible people.,FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-30T15:36:28,3
"Maybe there could be a “process” here, perhaps involving presenting evidence in a court of some kind where we could decide on the fate of these people instead of just making accusations. That could help clear some of that pesky confusion.",iamnobody19944,2025-04-30T23:58:42,3

Trump campaigned on HARD immigration.   They’ll do and say whatever they want to deport and raise the deportation numbers up.  Do you think they care?,Odd_Perfect,2025-05-01T09:40:28,1
"If these people were that bad, and there was proof, this government would be showing that proof everywhere.",DiceMadeOfCheese,2025-04-30T21:05:28,2
I agree that there likely are Trump supporters who can show empathy here but then they see Trump do his stupid little dance and fuck it deport everyone!  It’s sad.,hmr0987,2025-04-30T15:33:57,1

I wonder if the child is a US citizen so that’s why they kept it here? But yeah seems cruel,NoneOfThisMatters_XO,2025-04-30T15:46:31,1
No of course not. This is all a game for him.,NoneOfThisMatters_XO,2025-05-01T10:00:04,2
I suspect those who go to his rallies and such are the MAGAs....,Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T17:12:03,1
"But, they've been deporting children  who are U.S. citizens.  Either way, and I know you're trying to find a way to understand this horrible decision, but there is no way to justify taking a child away from his/her parents who have been deported.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-30T17:10:08,7
