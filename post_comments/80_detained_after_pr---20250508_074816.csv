"Saw a clip of Jesse Watters calling them insurrectionists, claiming they destroyed the library, and said they called for a terrorist uprising.  From what I could see from the video he himself showed, they just stood on tables, called for a resistance movement, and chanted about freedom for Palestine.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-08T07:56:41,14
"I think we all understand that Trump, Bondi, Rubio and this regime are going to use this situation to further their cause.  That will mean extensive use of resources to identify protesters, arrest and deportation of any non-Americans, prosecution of Americans, and sanctions against Columbia itself.  OK, and my assumption is those protesting understood these risks.  Standing up against an authoritarian regime is not without risk and that needs to be calculated into decision-making.   We need more of this kind of peaceful protesting.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T08:35:33,5
In the 20th century Hitler burned books.  Today they take over and destroy libraries.  What have we become?,dbag3o1,2025-05-08T08:51:27,-6
Think about all those people in that protest. the ones that actually went to the school. They now have to come home and say that they got kicked out of Columbia. For protesting and damaging the library.  Lolololololo.... if that was my kid I'd be saying hey... I paid for this shit.... you are now on your own.,Able_Win_8024,2025-05-08T08:53:44,-7
Jesse Watters is the insurrectionist and his willful propagation of misinformation  dismantles the very fabric of this nation.,hepakrese,2025-05-08T08:38:30,5
"“They”?   You missed where the right wing banned children’s books, weaponizes free speech, deports LEGAL residents and immigrants, ignores the rule of law, ignores judicial orders they don’t agree with, threatens to deport CITIZENS, does not recognize due process, dreams of putting the disabled into work camps, purges non-whites, threatens to kill dissenting political parties (or jailing them), attempts to override the Constitution, bullies private companies to do their bidding, stifles the fourth estate and used threats of military action against allies.",USAFGeekboy,2025-05-08T09:47:09,2
You aren’t seriously comparing these protesters to Hitler right?,Didntlikedefaultname,2025-05-08T09:50:55,2
