"VA-02 is absolutely winnable in the wake of the DOGE cuts. Lots of federal contractors in Virginia Beach. Probably would have been winnable even without it, but I would say a decent Dem challenger probably opens as the polling favorite if I had to guess. Find a center left military vet and we're in good shape.",snootyvillager,2025-04-12T08:40:02,67
Awesome! Unless they completely remove democracy by then…and destroy our economy…even bankrupt our nation completely…  https://preview.redd.it/ogtzyiheteue1.jpeg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=119055ee89aac9e59420aeb05254d6f1e7ffe58f,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-12T08:55:19,49
"Here's a suggestion. Start referring to them as the Republican  Tariffs or the GOP tariffs. Keep it simple. GOP Tariffs are causing a spike in car prices, in groceries. The Republican Tariffs are causing my medicine prices to go through the roof.",skrjabinesque,2025-04-12T10:15:43,35
"If you live in one of those districts, this is an excellent time to get to know what people in your neighborhood are thinking and note which ones have become more Trump-skeptical. Be more of a listener.   It's not too early to begin work on Election 2026.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-12T08:49:49,19

Glad to see two Wisconsin reps on there but disappointed to not see the lying liar Grothman (R) WI-6th. Who said to constituents cutting Medicaid “would be a mistake” and then voted for a resolution that would require cuts to Medicaid to make it mathematically possible.,cheesehed1,2025-04-12T09:11:23,4
Looks like my District here in Ohio is on the list! Happy to see that.,Reedstilt,2025-04-12T09:18:41,7
Steil here in SE WI doesn’t do any real town halls and there is absolutely a path for Dems if they put enough focus on the district with the federal job cuts. Many federal employees live in Kenosha alone so it’s a good place to start,blueblurz94,2025-04-12T09:44:35,4
Need to compete in every district regardless.   Out the GOP on defense,whitingvo,2025-04-12T10:45:54,5
If the national party really wants to show that they are for the blue collar then they need to REALLY show up in red places like Southern West Virginia. Carol Miller(R) has done nothing for that part of the state. They’ve been hit hard by nature twice in last couple of months and state and federal government hasn’t done shit for them.

It’s great Democrats have a target list. They also need stronger leadership who can say no to spending on stupid things. Debt is a national security issue.,BigTiger18,2025-04-12T14:01:51,1

"It’s definitely competitive, but Kiggins is a strong candidate. Last year, she overperformed Trump by almost 4 points & Hung Cao by 7.

I take issue only with the first one — Trump isn't running in 2026 and assigning blame onto him only gives congressmen and senators a pass (or at least plausible deniability). Tie all of them together. Republican Tariffs.,skrjabinesque,2025-04-12T12:57:37,7

It’s not infighting.  It’s saying to the ones who need a little reminder that they serve us and not immune to be replaced and if they want to keep their job they need to step up and do more.  A good primary is good for everyone.,jeffreynya,2025-04-17T19:51:05,0
I can't wait until near 2028 election when trump completely blame the gop and Vance for everything and completely tanks the repubs hopes. Unless they bend over and throw out the rules and let him rerun it's what's gonna happen,robbdogg87,2025-04-12T18:57:05,4
