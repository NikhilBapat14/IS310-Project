"Isn’t she on the list of people who voted to censure Green?  If so, good riddance. May the boos only grow louder.",Fuzzy-Heart,2025-04-25T05:31:34,17
She's one of the 10 members of the Blue Dog democrats caucus. They're functionally Republicans from a decade ago.  I can accept some that some blue dogs are moderate with some issues but the SAVE act and censuring Al Green was insane. It wouldn't have given any political blowback to oppose both besides one news cycle.  What really frustrates me is seeing that there are blue dog dems in districts like HI 1 that went +15 for Harris. Those are the people David Hogg wants to primary and he's getting pushback.,Pike_Gordon,2025-04-25T07:02:03,16
Everyone i know in her district reluctantly voted for her is unhappy with her. While i was unable to get inside the town hall i did protest outside. Supposedly she really did not answer questions.,sedatedlife,2025-04-24T23:45:09,32
"Good. At this point, voting for any Republican bill is capitulation. Before this over, it will be viewed as aiding and abetting.",barneyrubbble,2025-04-25T07:03:30,6
Did not get in but I was with the crowd outside of about 500 chanting “vote her out”  She chose a venue too small for us on purpose.,LaughReasonable6281,2025-04-25T07:59:55,5
"Hogg, I've got a target for you.",alabasterskim,2025-04-25T01:30:36,14
"MGP is a MAGAt in Blue.  She's not on the peoples side, she's on her side.  What benefits MGP that what she looks for.",BioticVessel,2025-04-24T23:58:11,16
Shes a DINO,Frequentlypuzzled,2025-04-25T04:54:05,8
"Who cares, the Democratic Party needs more people like her. Her brand of rural populism is what the party needs to start winning again. Same with people like Mary Peltola, Jared Golden, and Dan Osborn. More of them and less leftist freaks.",MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-25T14:13:34,-6
Yes and she also voted for the save act.,sedatedlife,2025-04-25T05:36:30,11
She is pretty much disliked from both sides right now. Clark County/SW Washington is a weird little world :-),PDXftw,2025-04-24T23:50:13,14
Yeah. There just wasn't much choice. I sure as hell wasn't going to vote for Joe Kent.,reflecttcelfer,2025-04-25T04:29:03,6
"For the longest, I actually believed she might just show up at the 11th hour. Now it’s clear she doesn’t care",JollyToby0220,2025-04-25T04:19:39,4
Of course you’d support that piece of shit David Hogg.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-25T14:12:14,-7
Yup she needs to face a primary and the DNC would be stupid to try and protect her.,sedatedlife,2025-04-25T00:10:39,11
"Typical leftist nutjobs criticizing Democrats who actually win with working class voters. She’s the exact same as someone like Dan Osborn, who are the only ones who can flip these rural areas from the GOP. She’s the furthest thing from a neoliberal, her whole thing is criticizing outsourcing and wanting to bring back jobs, which is what the working class wants.",MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-25T14:11:24,-3
That’s rich coming from a DINO.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-25T14:12:26,0
We don’t need more republicans in the democratic party.,Historical-Range6016,2025-04-25T18:56:51,3
How dare he try to change things? The nerve of some people  /s,wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-27T12:37:58,1
"She faced a primary after doing a piss poor job as a freshman.  I had hold my nose on that vote.  What difference would it have made with representation if Kent had been elected?  He's a reprehensible human being, but it seems the votes would have been the same.  Kent no more represents my views than does MGP.  They're both garbage IMO.",BioticVessel,2025-04-25T10:53:28,1
That’s all good - but when she works off gop fear based talking points like making sure illegals don’t vote - knowing they don’t - we don’t trust her.  She should be smart enough to know that the save act is designed to keep women and minorities from voting.,Jolly_Grocery329,2025-04-26T11:22:34,2
"She not only wanted to restart student loan payments, but she also wanted to tack on retroactive interest for the 4 years when payments and interest were paused.  Fuck outta here with that shit",wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-27T12:40:40,1
Right?!? lol,Jolly_Grocery329,2025-04-26T11:46:26,1
In what way are those people Republicans?,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-25T19:18:14,-1
Good. Student loan forgiveness is a wealth transfer at the expense of the working class. Don’t go for a worthless degree at an overpriced school and expect tax payers to bail you out. Maybe focus on lowering the cost of education.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-27T22:33:49,1
This is in reference to MGP being a complete sellout… shameless,Historical-Range6016,2025-04-25T19:19:08,3
Oh right gotta save the money to bail out the billionaires and corporations. How could I forget,wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-27T22:46:31,1
Lol I oppose bailing them out as well. Taxpayers don’t need to be footing the bill for irresponsible business decisions.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-27T23:13:58,1
Cool well I guess let's continue keeping higher education out of reach for everyone but trust fund.babies and then scratch our heads wondering how the US.ended up with a criminal pervert fascist at the helm,wilma_dikfit2416,2025-04-27T23:24:06,1
It’s perfectly in reach for people. Go do generals at the local community college and transfer to an affordable state school. Or just start at the state school and choose a degree that pays well. Low income people have plenty of resources with grants & scholarships. But Democrats should focus on lowering the cost of education. Forgiving student loans is like trying to put a band-aid on a severed arm.,MelodicFlight3030,2025-04-27T23:29:35,1
