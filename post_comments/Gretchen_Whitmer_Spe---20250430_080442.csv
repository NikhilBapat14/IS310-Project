Didn't she almost get kidnapped by maga or am I thinking about someone else?,st2439,2025-04-30T08:11:07,4466
"I'm a Michigander.  This wasn't a ""Trump rally.""  It was an appearance at an Air Force base that she has been lobbying Trump to keep open.  That lobbying appears to have been successful.  OK.  That said. we're seeing a fracturing Democratic Party.  Whitmer seems to be embracing a lane of working with the regime, thinking there is still a path to bipartisanship.  That's a tad different than the centrists (Newsom, Slotkin) and quite different from Pritzker, Bernie, and AOC.   Whitmer is highly likely to run in 2028.  She is picking a lane, I'm not sure that will sell well to Democratic voters, and despite results for Michigan, it's not something I can support.  I've been a supporter of hers for many years now, but I'm not sure what Gretchen is doing here.  This seems a dangerous dance with the devil.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-30T08:28:15,5812
"Some of you are missing the point. No, this wasn't a Trump rally. And yes, this was more for Whitmer's successful lobbying. But she cannot hug the fascist. That's simple. What we can see from this moment is that Whitmer still believes voters want to see that democrats can reach across the aisle. We don't. We don't want placators and apologists. We want rabid, frothing at the mouth attack dogs pulling their chains from the concrete. We are in a fight against fascism. And the most depressing part is that ""fight"" isn't even the right word because *democrats aren't fighting and still think hugging the dictator is a gesture of maturity.* Whitmer has disqualified herself from 2028 prospects with this. She's shown that she doesn't understand what moment we're in, and she shouldn't need the angry polling data that'll come in 2 weeks to tell her that this was wrong.",the_toad_can_sing,2025-04-30T08:57:36,893

"“Whitmer joined Trump at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County on Tuesday. There had been fears that the base could close, but this week, those fears appeared to be quashed when Trump said he would ""save Selfridge,"" announcing new fighter jets for the base.   Whitmer and other Michigan officials have long pushed for a new fighter mission at the base, warning that the planned retirement of the A-10 fleet could severely impact Macomb County's economy. The base contributes an estimated $850 million annually to Michigan's economy and supports around 30,000 jobs. Whitmer has lobbied both the Biden and Trump administrations, highlighting Selfridge's legacy with fighter aircraft and its strategic location near an international border, making it ideal for future missions.  Following Trump's announcement, the president brought Whitmer onstage, seemingly catching her off guard.  ""Well, I hadn't planned to speak, but I'm—on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably, on behalf of the state of Michigan, I am really damn happy we're here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. It's crucial for the Michigan economy. It's crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. So thank you. I am so, so grateful that this announcement was made today, and I appreciate all the work. Thank you,"" Whitmer said.”  Literally a nothing burger.

I can tell you as a Michigander that I don’t love this however I can’t blame her for kowtowing to him a bit here. Trump holds the cards over our states economy. One tariff announcement could wreck the whole states economy. His policies are already taking a toll. This is not her becoming a maga follower. This is her doing her job to protect her constituents. Would I love for her to be out there standing up to him and calling him out like she did during Covid? 100% but I can also understand the political game she’s playing. She was fighting for the people of Macomb county to keep Selfridge open. She has succeeded for now. I don’t think she should spite her constituents solely to stick it to Trump.

The people in his circle enable him. He’s going to treat governors however he wants, because he can. He doesn’t need to be enabled in order to do crazy things.  The alternative would be for Whitmer to take a stand on principle, like the governor of Maine did, and ultimately the state of Michigan and its people would be the ones to suffer the consequences when he decides to withhold federal funding, etc. out of spite. Standing up to him on principle would align with the kinds of things democrats insist in a normal political climate, when they can reasonably assume that other side will have some measure of decorum. We are not living in that political climate right now. She’s doing what needs to be done to help her state. I’m all for being principled, but I think it’s important to see the forest for the trees. If all you have left are your principles, and you’re preaching about them to the other side who couldn’t possible care less, what good does that do you? Dems have tried for so long to act in a way that’s principled to a fault (i.e. Schumer writing a FIRM LETTER to the Trump administration). It obviously hasn’t worked.  Also, this was not a rally. They’re at an Air Force base which is in need of funding. Falsely stroking his ego is probably the only way to get that funding.

A national guard reservist that's in our local Indivisible group shed some light on why Whitmer's appearance at this event is a bit more nuanced than it first appears.  Selfridge is a national guard base. When Michigan's National Guard members take their oaths, they take one to the Michigan Constitution and one to the US Constitution. Our state's governor is their Commander In Chief. Just like we wouldn't let a foreign head of State like Putin address US troops unsupervised, it's appropriate for Michigan's Commander In Chief to be there when Trump is addressing OUR national guard. If Trump ever tried to send troops into Michigan under martial law, our national guard would have to choose whether or not to block them.  Additionally, the aircraft deal at Selfridge predates Trump, he's swooping in at the last minute to take credit for something that was a decade in the making.  With that added context out of the way, the hug was %1000 unnecessary and inexcusable. For a woman who first rose to political prominence for a moving speech in the Michigan Senate about how she was a sexual assault survivor, I don't know what was going through her head giving a hug to a convicted Rapist.",_DocWatts,2025-04-30T09:46:45,3

The photo you see is taken at the base when the announcement was made that the base would stay open and operating.  It is not at a political rally.  You cannot hold a political rally on a military base.  Trump did later hold a political rally as part of his trip, and Whitmer was not present at the political rally.

"In MI, it makes more sense with how the Michigan Republican party has spent the last 10 years imploding. Trump won the state, but other Republicans underperformed in comparison. The state party is still fuming and at war with itself.  If there's voters there to win over with a rightward move, now would be the time.  We're seeing the early stages of a war in the Democratic party with young progressives on one side, centrists on another, and older-establishment democrats on a third front. The last thing the country needs is democrats ripping into one another but I kind of see this as just what happens when no one can agree on a collective direction to go. You've got Bernie and AOC on one end trying their thing. You've got Hogg in the DNC trying his thing. Senate Democrats trying their thing. Now Whitmer is trying this.  2026 will likely become the test bed by which that path of 2028 will be made. Or not made.

I was heartbroken, but the DSA leadership I worked under? They were excited. For them, this was a moment of opportunity - their time to take the lead.  This is what I see in the discourse now: Kamala’s defeat is read not as a tragedy or setback, but as a signal, the weakening of the center-coalition, blood in the water. The entrenched far-left, so very thirsty since their abandonment and sabotage of Carter led to a more technocratic, business-friendly Democratic Party, can’t help but salivate at the scent.

Recall, for example, the attempt a few years back to strong-arm Apple into granting them access to customer records and encryption keys to investigate a single workplace shooting that they had labeled as a national security incident. That had the more authoritarian members of Congress proposing that Apple insert a backdoor into every iOS, which would have made every iPhone, iPod, and iPad an FBI and NSA tracking device. Things ended when the agents on the case managed to brute-force their way into the specific phone they wanted access to–and at that time, MAGA were all in favor of that particular act of government intrusion.

As for why Harris lost specifically? Man I don't even know. There's so many little things you can point at but I don't even know where to begin to start analyzing that mess.  Was the voter suppression what pushed it over? Was it the bomb threats phoned in from Russia to blue districts? What was up with all those people that voted Trump and then literally nothing else for a single other candidate? Why were people confused on election day asking why Biden wasn't on the ballot (like holy hell on that.)  In the end, the largest facts are that Trump's numbers were comparable to last time while Harris just didn't turn out enough voters and fell well below Biden's numbers which honestly barely won last time.  To me, that sounds like people just really weren't excited to vote for Harris. Now my personal opinion, is that she started off strong and had people I knew excited about the swap and the messaging seemed to be good and everyone was feeling great about it. Then, as the campaign went on she absolutely refused to distance herself from Biden who was incredibly unpopular and then began to rein in the messaging to moderate everything to ""play nice"" to avoid offending a mythical moderate voter that always votes against democrats but will totally swap this time honest.  Again, just my opinion with nothing backing it up and no deep analysis, but people were desperate for change, and Harris ultimately was a ""more of what we're doing now"" candidate or at least that was the perception she was constantly giving off.  I could go on for hours for other possible things that might've cost her the election but ultimately I'd put money on it not being a single thing but instead a huge convergence of different factors.",Hurtzdonut13,2025-04-30T16:14:40,1

"This isn't correct. Forcing someone to do a crime would be coercion or something similar. Entrapment isn't clear cut like that, and isn't about forcing someone.  I believe the main factor for entrapment is that the officer persuaded someone to do a crime they otherwise *wouldn't* have committed without the officer's involvement.

Voters aren't interested in  compromising, centrist Dems with no platform beyond ""Not Trump""   Pete Buttigieg fails both those criteria IMO. If America isn't ready for a woman Prez, then I don't think we're ready for a gay male Prez. Simple as that.

"I contend in fact we have evidence of quite the opposite. For instance, in AOC's district she as the most ideologically pure leftist in Congress had a surge of split-ticketing voters who simultaneously voted for Trump at the top of the ticket, and AOC as their representative. When she reached out to these specific voters to ask why they did this, they all echoed the same general sentiment: Trust and authenticity.  We further have evidence that the watered-down third way centrist candidate already lost. In fact we literally lost the entire government following this belief that if we cater to the blind we will get them eventually. If that's not the definition of insanity to think we should try that again, then I don't know what is.  Moreover how exactly does sharing a stage with Trump and hugging him help distinguish the Democratic party from the Republican one that is clear threat to Democracy?   So here's a thought: shouldn't the Democrats act as a bulwark against this administration? Shouldn't they fiercely advocate for the direction the country should go and not engage in appeasement to the petty dictator wannabe? I mean come on, this was the lady whose Trump goons tried to have her kidnapped during the pandemic, and she is basically playing the Chamberlain role of appeasement.

I think part of the real answer here towards building a more enduring democratic foothold is realising it’s not always a competition and that no lone single person will convince everyone: you’ll need Pete’s, you’ll need AOCs, you’ll need a lot of things, and we shouldn’t just dismiss people, the way we’ve done (or even youre doing now).",firechaox,2025-04-30T13:35:50,-1
"lol, did we hear the same podcast? My take away is that:  a) he thought dems had to develop a new vision, given that like it or not, Trump is breaking the current order and is also a sign that business as usual just wasn’t working. I think having a plan in place already 4m in, when you’d have to draw a new order and a new modus operandi (while still reacting to the current administration) is a bit of a weird bar, and if that’s the one you have not sure anyone has that so far.   B) what I understood from his point about project 2025, is that the dem party just isn’t one to be top-down policy wise, and can you argue the contrary? For god’s sake, I’m pretty sure the dem establishment has been one of the things most blamed for their losses, do you think 1) they’d be capable of drawing a plan like that 2) if they did the party would be capable of embracing it? There’s way too much infighting; even if you want a unified national plan a la project 2025, if you don’t unify the party first there’s really no point. And I don’t see the appetite from the left to unify and to homogenise opinions as much as Maga has done.  Tbh I thought him recognising any of these steps, was a step further than most dems at all- few of while realise both that 1) trump is destroying the old order 2) even if you take back power, you do likely need a new path forward- you can’t go thank to the old.   Regarding your final point, dude has continued to be making appearances in the media spaces he’s going, and I think you need lots of people going into lots of spaces. To me any presidential talk is premature, and I’m just focusing on people doing good important work (I.e: push back).

"I’m a socialist. I could give a shit if he’s gay. And my preferred candidate is AOC, so I don’t personally subscribe to theory #1, that the Democrats cannot nominate a woman, a person of color, someone LGBTQ.  But my point stands. There are people in the Democratic base who blame these losses in 2016 and 2024 on running female candidates. Those people believe the Democrats cannot win unless they run the most ”mayonnaise“ candidate possible. A 55-year old straight, cis, married, Christian, centrist white dude who will campaign on civility and reaching across the aisle. I am not in that camp, but it’s fair to point out that Pete fails this first criticism.  I am firmly in camp #2. I think they lost because Hillary and Kamala didn’t stand for anything. To be fair, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden didn’t stand for anything either. But Bill, Barack, and Joe won their elections, and no one is doing an autopsy of John Kerry’s loss in 2004. The sincerity of Al Gore’s environmentalism is debatable, but you could argue that Gore actually had SOMETHING on the agenda. But most importantly, Pete Buttigieg fails second criticism too.  It’s a Venn Diagram. Some democratic voters are 100% in camp #1. Some Democratic voters, and some protest voters are firmly in camp #2. There are also probably some Bernie bros with a foot in each camp. But my point was that Pete fails on BOTH criteria. And I suspect that Democrats will nominate some like Pete or Gretchen Whitmer, who fails on both theories. Because it’s a fucking clown party.  I would rather see the Dems swing for the fences with AOC than see yet another attempted bunt with Gavin Newsome. But Pete is that worst case scenario that doesn’t appeal to progressives and leftists OR appeal to swing voters.

"To that I do see your point. For what it's worth I grew up in rural PA Republican household. I know how these folks tick better than most; many of my relatives remain ardent Trump voters, sadly.  What I'm trying to say is that regardless of the capitulation with this regime, we keep enabling the country moving rightward while getting no closer and in fact further from our goal of addressing active crises like inequality, campaign finance and election reform, climate change, health care, etc. Each time we forfeit what we truly believe is the correct path for this country, we make it that much harder to advocate for these next time around because people go, ""We can't do that because convincing the others is too hard!"" This is a bad loop to be caught in.  The good news to me is that there is a way you and I can both have our cake. Hear me out. Recognizing first that we just found moderate consultancy talking points don't win elections either, we can identify examples from Walz to AOC to Sanders who all win over Republicans in their rural areas by speaking authentically, candidly, and with a progressive economic working class message.  You're not wrong that niche cultural issues played key in distracting these ""poorly educated"" voters (Trump's words, not mine). After all, right wing populist extremism preys off fears of the voter in times of scarcity. They say, ""it's the trans or poor immigrant stealing your hard-earned paycheck!"" And instead of playing into their hand on the cultural aspect of this, leftist populism must embrace solidarity by saying, ""No, it's the ultra rich stealing your hard-earned paycheck! We as the working class must unite!"" It's a simple message that is also very true. If we look at the demographics of 2024, we see Democrats performed pretty well with more educated voters but the bottom fell out especially with non-educated working class voters. To me this suggests a messaging problem; and I posit it may be why all the way back in 2016 that in nearly every head-to-head polling matchup Sanders outperformed Clinton against Trump.  So I think we need to identify and dispel the myth that is, ""progressive economic populism is less safe than what we've been doing.""

And for that kind of outreach, which is about reaching out to a diverse set of groups, it’s also about having lots of different people who can travel and speak to those groups. The same person who listens to AOC may not listen to Pete and vice-versa. This will be fought on several fronts. Pete has done what newsom tried, but Pete actually does it well: he goes into Republican spaces, doesn’t grovel, doesn’t just go along with their talking points, but actually introduces his own ideas and his own talking points. And that’s going to be part of the story. There’s a shit ton of people with buyer’s remorse, but you have to be willing to engage with them to bring them into your side. And as much as I want them to eat shit, for getting us here in the first place, if we’re stuck pointing fingers rather than forgiving, this dark era of American history will last a lot longer.  You should read some history, and from other countries. You keep talking about office, when I haven’t even mentioned any office. You can wield political influence without office, and in fact that’s always been the case: in the past student union leaders, union leaders, and media journalists. In the present look at rogan and musk. I don’t understand why you keep talking about electability of his when that’s never been a topic.",firechaox,2025-05-01T05:30:57,1
"You keep wanting to talk about presidency, when I haven’t even suggested that. You see a potential candidate for president, who competes against your potential favorite so you want to bring him down.   I see a situation where the situation is so bad, and I don’t even know there will be a next election, that I’m just worried about having people out there pushing back against this administration, and who want to reach out to the right groups to keep democracy alive, and i see Pete as one of these. It’s about finding allies and surrogates here, because AOC won’t reach out to the same person that Pete will. I don’t understand this obsession of competing, when right now we need unity and there isn’t even a competition right now anyway. Like what’s the point of criticising someone as not your preferred presidential candidate when it’s not even relevant bro?  Wake the fuck up. Like guess what, I wouldn’t vote for you either, but that’s never been a relevant point- so why are you bringing this up?",firechaox,2025-05-01T05:38:02,1
"Right. We need to show up in bigger numbers, that's what I'm saying. Bernie wasn't enough to excite Americans to come to the polls for him.  So who?",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-04-30T23:27:29,1
"There are two alternatives:   1) Collaborate and kiss ass, receive nothing. See: Huckabee  2) Fight back and win in the courts. See: Gov. Mills.  The choice is clear, and you're siding with Vichy.",Felonai,2025-04-30T12:49:54,0
"So you tell me how you stop Trump from ending the work to keep Asian Carp out of the Great Lakes if the Governor takes your advice?   You care more about the optics of appearing near Trump, not endorsing him, not even thanking him, not even shaking his hand - than you do about real things.  Both of these things are important, but if I'm being honest. Keeping the Asian Carp out of the Great Lakes is more important than some photographs.  You have to think keeping Asian carp out of the Great Lakes is meaningless if you're saying what you're saying about Whitmer here.",RellenD,2025-04-30T12:45:09,3
And your idea sounds great in a vacuum but we don't live in a vacuum. If there are only two realistic choices you choose the one that isn't Trump or someone like him and work to hold them accountable to what you want/need. You don't throw away your vote on a candidate you know won't win or not vote at all because both are as good as voting for Trump or those like him.,loki2002,2025-04-30T15:45:04,0

"So you're saying because Trump is bad (and to be clear he is indeed very, **very** bad), I also need to act like I live in a dictatorship and only vote for one party, who doesn't in anyway represent me? Who has continually suppressed the people who represent me, who has fought **20x harder** against my people than they ever have the fascists? For god sake, in between insider trading and breaking a fucking hip Nancy Pelosi was fighting for her fucking life at her age and still found time to fight like hell to give an important political office to a 70 year old cancer patient rather than a progressive representative. Hopefully you understand how that's not gonna fly with me and people like me.",noobody77,2025-04-30T16:13:13,2
"We don't need to get ""the average primary voter"" on our side. We need our side to vote in primaries.  If Bernie, or AOC, or whoever the leftmost primary candidate is, gets 30+ million votes then they'll be the next nominee no matter what the prototypical primary voter does.  Assuming that Americans really do want anything that resembles leftism, it would be trivial to sweep the primaries at all levels if we just show up based on how low turnout is.  Hillary only got ~17 million votes. Biden only got ~19 million. It wouldn't even take 10% of eligible voters to absolutely *demolish* those numbers.",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-04-30T23:58:14,1
"That really doesn't apply here. You were  in a discussion about Whitmer doing what is necessary to, among other things, keep Asian carp out of the Great Lakes and said Whitmer isn't working for what you want.  This isn't a valid usage of that concept.  This conversation was more like  Person A: Gretch is doing what's necessary to keep waffles in existence  Person B: Gretchen isn't doing what I want  Person C: so you don't want waffles to exist?",RellenD,2025-04-30T13:00:09,3
You vote for the person that bests represents most of ideas you agree with and then you work to cultivate that candidate to conform to what you want/need but in the end you don't vote for Trump or others like him or don't just not vote at all because it's the same as voting for Trump or those like him.  Even if you got your super progressive party no candidate is ever going to fully embody your ideals. They will all have flaws and they will all fall short.,loki2002,2025-04-30T16:27:06,0
"It's not happening. And the DNC and their friendly donors and media will just figure out another way to scare boomer Dems into voting for their corporate friendly Liberal candidate. Last time it was Chuck Todd and Chris Matthews comparing Sanders to the Nazis, while everyone else insisted that Biden had the #electability factor that no one had.  Not to mention Obama pulling strings in the background to get everyone to drop out and endorse Biden at the right moment.  The reality is that we are stuck with shitty candidates that can barely beat Trump, that isn't going to change",Overton_Glazier,2025-05-01T00:08:54,1
"Way to entirely ignore all of the points I brought up. End of the day, there's an entire goddam world of difference between ""no candidate is ever going to fully embody your ideals"" and ones like the majority of democrats, ex Nancy Pelosi who embodies everything I'm against, but who isn't quite a straight up fascist, no she just likes fascists a whole hell of a lot more than progressives and would rather they be in power than progressives. There's no working with people like that.",noobody77,2025-04-30T21:19:06,1
">The reality is that we are stuck with shitty candidates that can barely beat Trump, that isn't going to change  Agreed. Unless enough of us vote in the primaries.  Edit: Accidentally hit submit before I meant to.  >Biden had the #electability factor   In fairness, he did win against Trump even if he wasn't my first choice.  >Obama pulling strings in the background to get everyone to drop out and endorse Biden  That only got Biden ~19 million votes. Again, if we'd all voted in the primary we would have dwarfed his numbers.",DefaultSubSandwich,2025-05-01T00:10:56,1
