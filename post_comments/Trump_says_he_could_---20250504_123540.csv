"The problem is Putin wants it all. No one should trust a thing he says. That said, we can’t do it all. Europe has to be taking a front seat in putting pressure on Russia to pull out and compromise on a peace deal.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-04T14:59:50,270
"Trump made the comments during an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that aired Sunday, telling host Kristen Welker that there is ""tremendous hatred"" between Ukraine and Russia.  The president says he remains hopeful a peace deal is possible, but confirmed that the U.S. would not remain a mediator indefinitely.  ""I do believe we're closer with one party. And maybe not as close with the other, but we'll have to see,"" Trump said. ""Five thousand soldiers a week on average, are dying. They're not American soldiers. But I want to solve the problem.""",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-04T12:43:25,129
"There's videos of Russians and Ukrainians torturing each other while their still alive, executing each other, castrating each other. Anyone with half a brain knew there was ingrained hatred stemming to before the czarist days of russia. You can't just invade another nation killing hundreds of thousands and lose so much in the process and just say oops my bad. Trump was niave and was thinking like a businessman. Things like this are more difficult to fix than just a business conflict, and Trump claiming he could fix it in one day put himself in a worse position than if he simply said I will work to broker an agreement to cease the bloodshed.",cledus1667,2025-05-04T22:01:53,25

"You nailed it.   Reminds me of his first inaugural in Jan 2017....when he stated unequivocally: ""Today, crime stops.""  I couldn't believe the hutzpah....and I was astounded that the Dems didn't roll that one out during the 2020 and 2024 campaigns to discredit Trump. I guess they were too lazy to dig up the archival footage.

"For all their talk, Europe is not serious. Over the past three years, they have actually sent more money to Russia via gas purchases than to Ukraine through military aid.  I believe that Russia, along with China, is our primary adversary and I believe that supporting Ukraine in their fight against Russia is not only the right thing to do but it's in our own national interest as well. That being said, it would be nice if our European allies were not quite so hypocritical on the matter and actually took real, meaningful action rather than simply paying lip service and then having the gall to shame us for not doing enough.",JoeWinchester99,2025-05-04T16:06:21,94
I think it's the exact opposite. Putin has what he wanted. The black sea.   Ukraine/zelensky is the one pushing for more war and threatening to attack during the ceasefire. Which they may have called off i would have when Ukraine threatened to attack a parade.   The same people that are turning the propaganda on us in america are the ones who told us putin was evil. All I see is eu' nato encroachment and a country that wants to stay independent.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-04T15:32:00,-117
"It's easy to listen to ""Russia bad"" propaganda which is being fed to everyone since birth.      Here's the thing, Ukraine did a lot of bad shit to deserve Russia's anger, all of the anti minority laws, language laws and other things which were even investigated for human rights violations, it is quite literally fascism (Ukraine for Ukrainians) which is further confirmed by Poland-Ukraine relationship and history.      BUT there were other ways to go about it than to invade Ukraine. For example all of the money which was spent on the war could have been spent on bringing the unhappy people to Russia (building housing, workplaces, etc) since they don't lack empty land. Then you also have this whole debacle of NATO encircling Russia and Russia saying ""stay away from our borders"" and NATO saying ""we will do what we like"".       Yes Russia is bad but so is Ukraine so I personally find it quite hypocritical to take any side if you know what's actually going on in both of those countries as well as global politics. Both countries are corrupt as hell, both countries oppress their population, both have forced conscription which resulted in many deaths, even deaths of parents protecting their children from being drafted, both countries persecute political opponents, and many more things.",Beautiful_Crow4049,2025-05-05T04:12:38,-19

"Well… by volume, most of those videos are evidence for Russians mercilessly torturing Ukrainians. There are bad actors everywhere (yes, even here at home) but the difference in kind an volume is staggering.  Let’s remember: ONE actor is the aggressor here, and it’s not Ukraine. I think the ‘hatred’ you see is more the fury of having to defend their (Ukrainians’) right to existence, AGAIN.  I fully agree that Trump stepped into the mess wholly unprepared and historically unaware. It may be easier for him to solve the India-Pakistan issue than this war. It’s funny: “neighborly” disputes are often the most heated.",PotatoesAndElephants,2025-05-04T23:29:04,61

"The belief of Putin and others of his ilk is that Ukraine belongs to them. Like, it's literally Russia in their eyes, and that Ukrainian culture is illigimate. They want to wipe that out and return the territory to its ""owners."" since Ukraine, you know, wants to exist, Russian leaders hate them.",cathbadh,2025-05-05T07:30:27,25
"They don't.  They're just scared to death we'll make another NATO nation in their sphere of influence.  Far be it from me to sound like a Putin apologist;  he's definitely a bad guy.  But the Russians aren't wrong in noting we broke our promise: that in exchange for allowing East Germany to be reunified with West Gwrmany, we wouldn't push NATO's borders any further east.  Since then, we've added 15 more counties, 13 of which were former Easten Block nations we promised not to add (Sweden & Finland are Putin's fault).  The ideal solution would be to allow Ukraine to exist as a ""buffer state"".  But Russia has no guarantee we won't let Ukraine join NATO after the war.  And we have no guarantee they won't invade again, to take the whole hog.  It will take some Bismarck-level diplomacy to untie this Gordian knot.",Carl-j88aa,2025-05-04T21:13:21,-28

"You arent wrong. There was a peace agreement on the table back during the original start of the conflict, and little Z refused to sign when the warmongers of Europe encouraged him to fight to the end.      Now Europe isnt going to put up the blood and debt necessary to help Ukraine, they expected the US to do it. It would have taken only a day had Zelensky understood the reality of the situation. The US is not going to fight a war with a country we have no issues with. This isnt the Soviet union.

">But the Russians aren't wrong in noting we broke our promise: that in exchange for allowing East Germany to be reunified with West Gwrmany, we wouldn't push NATO's borders any further east.  First of all, we never broke any agreements with Russia because we never made any.  We made a verbal agreement with the U.S.S.R.  When they dissolved in 1990, so did that agreement.  Secondly, there was *never* anything in writing with either the U.S.S.R. or Russia to that regards.  Third, Russia directly violated their [signed treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum) promising to respect Ukraine independence and sovereignty in their existing borders. They also signed that they would refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of the signatories to the memorandum, and undertake that none of their weapons will ever be used against these countries, except in cases of self-defense or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.  So Putin can go pound sand if he wants to whine about us violating some verbal agreement we made with a government that no longer exists.",MildlyBemused,2025-05-04T21:40:31,83

"All US treaties with the former USSR carried over to Russia.  We recognized them as the successor state.  So the idea that promises to the former were voided to the latter is a dog that won't hunt.  If our verbal agreements are worthless, the world will take note.  They won't trust anything not in ratified by the Senate.  Personal assurances by the President will become worthless.  You are correct that Russia violated its treaty with Ukraine.  I'm sure they'd argue it's a response to our renegging on not to expand NATO.  Either way, my concern is ""America First"".  I do not consider Ukraine as a ""vital national interest"".  Nor, for that matter, the Baltic States.  Issuing war guarantees to them was asinine.  The idea that the US would sacrifice New York City to defend Tallinn (i.e. nuclear war) is fanciful.  90% of Americans couldn't find it on a map.  99.9% wouldn't favor total war with Russia to defend it (Cheney family notwithstanding).  Time to prioritize.  The main enemy is China.  Every dollar & weapon we send to Ukraine is one less we have against China.  If they successfully invade Taiwan, our entire Pacific containment strategy is in shambles -- to say nothing of the micro-chip shortage that will ensue.  It would be an unmittigated geo-political disaster.  Asian/Pacific countries would question our commitment, even our ability, to stand up to the red dragon.",Carl-j88aa,2025-05-04T23:07:02,-16

">All US treaties with the former USSR carried over to Russia.  We recognized them as the successor state. So the idea that promises to the former were voided to the latter is a dog that won't hunt.  Says who?  I'm sure lawyers and diplomats would say otherwise.   An agreement struck with a country that dissolves doesn't automatically carry over to the new regime.  >If our verbal agreements are worthless, the world will take note. They won't trust anything not in ratified by the Senate. Personal assurances by the President will become worthless.  Oh, please.  Ever heard the phrase, ""get it in writing""?  A verbal agreement between countries is just that.  An ""agreement"".   There is no legal force binding either party, unlike a signed treaty.  >You are correct that Russia violated its treaty with Ukraine. I'm sure they'd argue it's a response to our renegging on not to expand NATO.  They can argue whatever they like.  We literally violated no verbal agreements with the U.S.S.R. or Russia regarding NATO expansion.  However, Russia under Vladimir Putin has violated or disregarded nine separate arms control agreements and treaties he either inherited or signed, including:  * The Helsinki Final Act of 1975, also known as the Helsinki Accords, wherein signatories pledged not to use military force to change borders in Europe * The aforementioned Budapest Memorandum of 1994 * The Istanbul Document of 1999 (in which Russia pledged to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova) * The Presidential Nuclear Initiatives of 1991 and 1992 (in which Russia pledged to withdraw from active service various naval tactical nuclear weapons and to eliminate all ground-launched tactical nuclear weapons) * The 1992 Open Skies Treaty (in which Russia blocked U.S. access to parts of Russia clearly provided for under the treaty and also deviated from agreed flight paths over the U.S. that were mandated by the treaty) * The 1999 Vienna Document (Russia falsified and concealed military exercise information which it had agreed to provide) * The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Agreement (which Russia violated by covertly developing and then deploying a  missile which exceeded the permissible range limits established by the treaty * The 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention banning retention of chemical warfare agents, and * The 2011 New START Treaty (Russia has withdrawn from participation in treaty-mandated working groups and inspections) * Additionally, Russia is almost certainly violating the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention by maintaining an active bioweapons capability.  >The idea that the US would sacrifice New York City to defend Tallinn (i.e. nuclear war) is fanciful. 90% of Americans couldn't find it on a map. 99.9% wouldn't favor total war with Russia to defend it (Cheney family notwithstanding).  Russia is not going to start firing nukes at the United States.   It simply won't happen unless Putin goes literally insane.  And here's why.  In 2022, the United States spent $43.7 billion on the maintenance of its 5,044 nuclear warheads.  In the same year, Russia spent a paltry $9.6 billion on maintenance of its supposed 5,500+ nuclear weapons.   See anything amiss here?  Somehow Russia has 8% more nuclear weapons than the U.S. but spent 78% less maintaining them?  And this is Russia we're talking about, where corruption in the military runs rampant.  I wonder how much of that $9.6 billion actually made it to its intended destination.  No, I am certain that Russia's nuclear arsenal is kept in no better condition than their tanks, their ships and their planes.  >Time to prioritize. The main enemy is China. Every dollar & weapon we send to Ukraine is one less we have against China. If they successfully invade Taiwan, our entire Pacific containment strategy is in shambles -- to say nothing of the micro-chip shortage that will ensue.  We aren't exactly helpless in the maritime department.  While the U.S. Navy doesn't have quite as many ships as the People's Liberation Army/Navy does, we more than make up for it in quality and lethality.  The USN has 66 nuclear powered attack submarines compared to the 12 of China.  And I would hazard an easy guess that the USN crews are much better trained than their Chinese counterparts.  Not to mention our 11 aircraft carrier strike groups compared to just the 2 of China.  And it wouldn't just be the USN countering China.  The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force, South Korean navy and other NATO member navies would likely join in as well in the event of an unprovoked attack on Taiwan.    China would not have an easy time of it.",MildlyBemused,2025-05-05T01:14:38,31

">.  Not to mention our 11 aircraft carrier strike groups compared to just the 2 of China.  They have 4. One was a rust bucket, one was converted into a casino and back into a carrier, one is home built, and one is still in testing. None can carry their newest and best fighters, and all are jump carriers whereas ours are super carriers that can carry our best planes. Ours carry something like twice the number of planes too.  >  China would not have an easy time of it.  A lot would depend on if our allies backed us or not. With the tariff threats and general demeanor of our foreign policy, we can't guarantee it anymore. That said, most people ignore the fact that we can shut down commercial shipping to and from China, and they get most of their fuel and 1/3 of their food and much of their fertilizer from shipping.

"[South Korea’s growing support for Taiwan signals regional shift](https://ipdefenseforum.com/2024/03/south-koreas-growing-support-for-taiwan-signals-regional-shift/)  >South Korea is boosting its support for Taiwan in the face of Beijing’s threats to annex the self-governed island, a global hub for semiconductor manufacturing.  >Public statements by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, official and semi-official delegation visits from Seoul to Taipei, and enhanced defense alignments with the United States and other allies and partners demonstrate the shift in focus, which analysts say stems from Seoul’s need to maintain the Indo-Pacific balance of power, promote economic stability and insulate the region from large-scale conflict.  >Further expressions of Seoul’s support for Taiwan came with visits to Taipei by South Korean lawmakers and former high-ranking military officials, including the retired chairman of the nation’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.  >In recent polls, nearly two-thirds of South Koreans believe the country should provide direct or indirect support for U.S. military operations in the event of a Taiwan contingency, according to the Global Taiwan Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization.
