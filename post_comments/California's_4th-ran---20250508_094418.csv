Does anyone have a solution? The number will only increase throughout Tunt's term in office. I don't have one. Tent cities? Tunt towns?   Sleeping and shitting on the streets is not an option for anyone.,Weird-Ad7562,2025-05-08T13:52:30,1
"Our education system is pretty poor.   Tech companies, the lifeblood of this state are being driven out.  High earners are leaving the state.   Billions spent on new train construction that has been going on for almost 20 years and not an inch of rail laid.  $24 billion collected for homelessness that just vanished and homelessness has gotten worse  CA is being ruined by Newsom and the state legislature",box-cable,2025-05-08T09:49:17,-13
"Online echo chambers obscure California's harsh realities under single-party rule, prioritizing narrative over the struggles of millions. Divisive politics distract from urgent needs, hindering learning from partisan missteps. Fixing California requires pragmatic leadership focused on residents' well-being, not ideological entrenchment. We must demand better.",Okratas,2025-05-08T09:50:50,-18

There’s an elderly homeless lady in my community and as I was walking past her the other day a man who was also walking past stopped to ask her her story. She said she and her daughter lost their house back east last year. I couldn’t stick around to hear the rest but coming to California from out of state as an older homeless person certainly is not going to get you out of poverty! But the weather is livable. ,SAINTnumberFIVE,2025-05-08T10:21:13,2
"This is a common piece of misinformation unfortunately. The vast majority of people who are homeless in California are from California — and most are still living in the same county where they lost their housing, according to a recent large-scale survey of unhoused Californians conducted by the UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative. The survey found that [**90% of participants were from California**](https://homelessness.ucsf.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/CASPEH_Report_62023.pdf) (meaning they lived in California when they became homeless) and 75% lived in the same county where they were last housed.  The sad truth is that my states social and economic climate is hostile to Californians who are struggling.",Okratas,2025-05-08T09:54:20,-4

"The UCSFBH study just echo's the point in time studies by Los Angeles (LASHA) and San Francisco which also reported that homeless individuals were overwhelmingly from California. The data has been very consistent over the past decade. The Los Angeles data showed that roughly 66% of those surveyed were born in California. The data has been consistent and the truth is that our economic environment and hostile cost of living, pushes people in California out of their homes and onto the streets.  > Sixty-five percent of the homeless people in Los Angeles County have **lived in L.A. County for more than 20 years**, according to LAHSA's 2018 demographic survey.   * [Your Homeless Neighbors Have Probably Lived In LA Longer Than You](https://laist.com/news/los-angeles-homeless-demographic-race-gender)",Okratas,2025-05-08T10:13:17,-2
Yeah because decades of bad housing policy finally caught up to the state and the cities. Even if we tried now it’ll take years to implement the housing policy to meet demand and force cities to actually build again.,Cantomic66,2025-05-08T10:19:10,2
