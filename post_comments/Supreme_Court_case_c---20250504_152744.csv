"Said it before and I'll say it again:  Banning LGBTQ education because of ""religion"" is the modern day version of the South banning education about racism and equality of the races because Southern Baptists believed black people weren't full humans beings.  This shit is absurd. No doubt that plenty of Southerners and others today would try the same move with respect to race and mixed race marriages, etc. - they'd use religion to justify it if we let them. But we *don't* allow that because we know how fucking immoral and stupid that is. And yet, somehow America is willing to allow religion to work as an excuse for banning LGBTQ education. It's insane and disgusting and Americans need to grow a backbone and stop this shit.",sillyhillsofnz,2025-05-04T16:24:38,110

">Today, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on whether Oklahoma can force taxpayers to fund the state‚Äôs first-ever Catholic charter school. Opponents say the school violates the Constitution‚Äôs First Amendment, which forbids the government from endorsing a preferred religion, and they worry that a court victory could give right-wing religious conservatives even greater permission to mix church and state.  >The case,¬†[*Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond*](https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/oklahoma-statewide-charter-school-board-v-drummond/), involves the St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which is seeking to become the first publicly funded religious school in the nation. The school‚Äôs lawyers say that the institution deserves access to Oklahoma‚Äôs taxpayer funds for charter schools because depriving them of access would violate the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause, which requires the government to allow people to freely practice their religion. The school also says it‚Äôs unfair discrimination to forbid religious schools from participating in a taxpayer-funded state charter school program that other schools can participate in.  >Barrett has recused herself from hearing¬†*Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond*, which means the case could potentially get a split 4-4 decision. If this happens, then the Oklahoma Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling against the religious school will stand. Anti-LGBTQ+ religious conservatives¬†[have long wanted](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/08/influential-anti-lgbtq-christian-activist-caught-admitting-secret-plan-to-defund-public-schools/)¬†a Supreme Court victory that would redirect billions of taxpayer funds from public schools to religious homeschools and charter schools.  >At another point, Kavanaugh suggested that rules requiring charter schools to be non-religious are a form of ‚Äúrank discrimination against religion.‚Äù This view holds that it‚Äôs unconstitutional discrimination for the government to provide benefits of any kind without also providing religious versions of that same benefit,¬†[Vox.com write Ian Millhiser noted](https://www.vox.com/scotus/411185/supreme-court-religion-charter-schools-oklahoma-drummond).  >Liberal Justice Elena Kagan focused on the implications of this case, asking if religious charter schools could refuse to educate children who don‚Äôt share the school‚Äôs faith or whether taxpayers would be forced to fund religious schools that don‚Äôt want to teach certain subjects, like a school that chose to teach creationism instead of science or a Jewish school that only taught in Hebrew.  Christian nationalists are trying to turn America into Sunday school. They want to force schools to basically become child soldier camps for their Christian army, where they kick out all the nonbelievers and exterminate the ""infidels"".

"US Constitution First Amendment:  ‚ÄúCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof [‚Ä¶]‚Äù  The First Amendment has two provisions concerning religion: the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. The Establishment clause prohibits the government from ‚Äúestablishing‚Äù a religion.  In 1802 Thomas Jefferson (3rd US President, one of the Founding Fathers, and the primary author of the Declaration of Independence wrote:  ‚ÄúBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ‚Äúmake no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,‚Äù thus **building a wall of separation between Church & State.** Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.‚Äù  **THE LITERAL ONLY THING MAGAts/GQP CARE ABOUT IN THE CONSTITUTION IS 2A** and their warped boner with it.  WE THE PEOPLE will NOT be forced into Christianity, (nor any other religion).",icecreemsamwich,2025-05-04T16:44:38,9
"Let's take the time to explain *why* this is so unconstitutional, and with the added bonus of shutting down the revisionist talking point from conservatives who claim that America was ""founded on Christianity""  Our nation was not founded on religious doctrine, but enlightenment era principles that turned away from the religious authority of the church, away from the divine right of kings (looking at you Trump), away from a national religion, and towards reason, rationality and democratic ideals.  The framers relied on those principles to write our founding documents and they both challenged and feared the merging of religion and government. They rejected the Church of England and repeatedly rebuked the idea of a national religion or church.   There is substantial evidence and documentation that points to these facts:  But first, it should be noted that the Bible reveals how even Jesus Christ himself believed in the separation of church and state:  Mark 12:17, ""Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.""  With that out of the way, it is documented *fact* that the founders staunchly opposed the union of religion and government.  In actuality, a number of founding fathers were purported to be deists who clashed with the idea that some divine hand is meddling in our affairs. Instead, they emphasized the importance of rationality, intellect and observation in understanding nature and how society should be governed.  Thomas Jefferson is often credited with coining the phrase ""a wall of separation between church and state"" in his letter to the Danbury Baptist association.   Thomas Jefferson's metaphor became part of constitutional jurisprudence. Jefferson was later quoted by Chief Justice Morrison in Reynolds v. United States in 1878, and was famously referenced in the Supreme Court Case, Everson v. Board of Education, which interpreted the First amendment's establishment clause as intending to erect that ""wall of separation.""  Jefferson's writings have been referenced in a series of important legal cases and public debates throughout our history.   His famous words are often invoked to stress the importance of how this separation protects the rights of the people, and how it preserves the functionality of government and the virtue of religious practice. This includes protecting Americans from a repressive, governing religious authority, and guarding one's religious practice from government intervention.  Roger Williams, an early puritan minister, founder of the state of Rhode Island and the first Baptist Church in America, was the first public official to call for ""a wall or hedge of separation"" between ""the wilderness of the world"" and ""the garden of the church.""  There you have it, an early American statesman and minister‚Äîand a profound authority on the matter‚Äîacknowledging the need for this separation.   James Madison interpreted Martin Luther's ""Doctrine of Two Kingdoms"" as a conception of the separation of church and state.  During a debate in the House of Representatives, Madison also contended, ""Because if Religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body.""  In his writings years later he documented his support for the ""total separation of the church from the state.""  ""Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion & Govt in the Constitution of the United States,"" Madison wrote, and he declared, ""practical distinction between Religion and Civil Government is essential to the purity of both, and as guaranteed by the Constitution.""  John Locke also promoted this idea. In his, ""A Letter Concerning Toleration,"" Locke argued that, ""ecclesiastical authority must be separated from the authority of the state, or 'the magistrate.'""  Even George Washington supported this separation.  George Washington, who wrote to a group of clergy who protested in 1789 against a lack of mention of Jesus Christ in the Constitution, stated, ‚ÄúYou will permit me to observe that the path of true piety is so plain as to require but little political direction.‚Äù  That same year, he wrote to the Baptists of Virginia, ‚ÄúIf I could conceive that the general [federal] government might ever be so administered as to render the liberty of conscience insecure‚Ä¶ no one would be more zealous than myself to establish effectual barriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of religious persecution.""  As for a more recent example, even John F. Kennedy, in his Address to the Greater Houston Ministerial Association in 1960, stated, ""I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.""  Furthermore, ""One Nation under God"" wasn't even added to the pledge of allegiance until the 1950s, when there was a moral panic and fundamentalist revival that unfairly persecuted anyone who was assumed to be gay, communist, atheist, or anything but a god fearing, Christian patriot for that matter.  The pledge of allegiance was first published in 1892 in an Issue of ""The Youth's Companion,"" an American Children's Magazine.  Francis Bellamy, a Christian **socialist**, who was said to have ""'championed the rights of working people and the equal distribution of economic resources,"" which he believed was inherent in the teachings of Jesus Christ, worked for the magazine and drafted the ""Pledge of Allegiance"" as part of a marketing campaign to solicit subscriptions and sell U.S. flags to public schools.  The issue coincided with the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus reaching the Americas; a marketing gimmick.  Bellamy ""believed in the absolute separation of church and state"" and intentionally did not include the phrase ""under God"" in his pledge.  What's more, Bellamy ""viewed his Pledge as an 'inoculation' that would protect immigrants and native-born but insufficiently patriotic Americans from the 'virus' of radicalism and subversion.""  Additionally, ""In God we trust"" wasn't officially adopted and mandated for our currency until the mid-20th century, as part of an effort to distinguish the U.S. from the big bad atheist communists of the Soviet Union.  And all of that aside, I shouldn't have to remind those on the religious right that our very first amendment prohibits the government from ""respecting an establishment of religion.""   The Supreme Court has also previously expanded on this, settling the debate and establishing three basic rules that must be followed in order to not violate the clause.  Government actions:  - must have a secular purpose - must not promote or inhibit religion - must not create excessive entanglement between the church and state   The fact of the matter is, religion is *not* the bedrock upon which our country, its constitution and its government was founded. And regardless of how many Christian Nationalists have slithered their way into our government, it is still wholly un-American to even suggest that Christianity be used as some state tool to pacify citizens, or become the basis for this country's rule of law.  It *is* self evident, that in the United States of America, religion has no place in government, and vice versa.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-04T17:09:04,8

"In most religions is the instruction to treat others with kindness, or as you would like to be treated. There are different wordings in different faiths.  Scorning and demonizing a whole demographic is not in keeping with this fundamental instruction. They're cherry picking their own faith and only taking their favorite parts into account. For that reason they are not to be taken seriously, any more than they would be if they demonized an entire race.",473713,2025-05-04T20:31:28,7
"I'd sure love to see chapter on verse on some of the things that people claim as their ""religion"". Seems to be their cultural taboo 9 times out of 10, and in secular societies we don't let that interfere with others.  Like what *specifically* in the bible says that your kids shouldn't go to school with people unlike them?   Also, should we be able to serve foods *in* schools that might cause a child to violate their parents religious beliefs? After all, we don't want our tax dollars going to things that contradict with our religious principles. If so no cheese burgers (meat + dairy), sausage pizza, meat of any type on Friday and that's just the Abrahamic religions. If we're trying to accommodate everyone's beliefs, why are we stopping at just one?",egyeager,2025-05-05T00:53:09,3

"A parents rights should end where their children's begin. Children are not property to be forcibly encultured and indoctrinated due to their parents limiting their interactions with the outside world and the objective perspectives provided by peer reviewed academia.¬†   As someone raised and raped by Nazi scum Southern Baptists¬†I would go so far as to give children the right to disown their parents and place themselves in the care of the state. But for that to be ethically enforced there would need to be a massive overhaul in all our governmental systems and laws. Because right now while children have the right to an education they do not have the right to choose what kind of education they receive, while children have the right to be free from harm, they are not taught what harm is, and are not given a choice in what their life looks like after removal.¬†   I would also want there to be a massive amount of research done before changes like the ones I'm alluding to and suggesting come anywhere near a politicians desk. Anything less would do disservice to all who have suffered under the tyranny of ""parents know best"".",Selto_Black,2025-05-04T16:36:15,49
"I don't have an answer because of Republicans controlling state legislatures as well and under-funding.
