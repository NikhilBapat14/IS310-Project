"Unfortunately most people who had money to start , had more money by the end of it.  The child care credits and pause on student loans really helped me. But by the time Biden got his hands on it - well , we are where we are now. Broke as a joke   Except for our boy Trump. Close to a billion lost due to restrictions on hotels / travel reported on the BBC in 2022",MapleMonstera,2025-04-21T19:49:45,-5

"Without additional data, this is the most plausible answer. First, inflation from 2019 to 2023 was about 10%. Much more importantly though, those with capital and the means to not have to withdraw it from the system during the initial Covid crisis, greatly benefitted from the economic rebound post Covid.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-21T21:26:26,30
He's not a billionaire though.   His years in government as the highest paid employee *only* made him a millionaire,JerseyKeebs,2025-04-22T12:44:17,2

‚ÄúNormal person‚Äù being funded by the pharmaceutical companies maybe.   I‚Äôve been heavily invested too and I sure as hell didn‚Äôt make that much.  Edit: awww look at all the lefty brigaders still brainwashed.  Fauci effed up. Just admit it losers. He lied and helped fund the gain of function research.   Oh wait. Never mind. The truth doesn‚Äôt matter to the left.,dottedoctet,2025-04-21T20:48:07,-29
Well home values also shot up during that time period‚Ä¶ what other assets would you think he‚Äôd have?,Swagastan,2025-04-22T04:50:26,28
"Not enough to double during Covid through today. Are you kidding me that you believe all home owners vested in Wall Street doubled their net worth since Covid?  No, he profited off Covid via kickbacks and probably insider trading how do you not get that? How can you be conservative and try to defend his doubling of wealth at the expense of Americans during covid? Are you that stupid? Or are you a liberal masquerading here?",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-22T06:51:31,-6
"I think yes most homeowners doubled the net worth of their home equity, due to appreciation during the 2019-2023 period. ie if you had 50k equity in a house in 2019 you almost certainly were looking at 100k in equity in 2023.",Swagastan,2025-04-22T13:16:54,5
