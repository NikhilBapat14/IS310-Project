"The White House provides their own list of ""accomplishments"" you can peruse. Obviously just keep in mind this is a list compiled by Biden and Harris staffers so keep your questioning attitude up.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/therecord/  This will probably be the most thorough and accurate list you could look at quickly.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-29T08:30:30,1
