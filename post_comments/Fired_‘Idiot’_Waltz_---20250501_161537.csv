"With how blatant and obvious the Heritage foundation has been, I have to hope and pray that the former administration worked with true patriots in the military and government to develop a plan to oust this administration once they become clearly enemies of the state.   I‚Äôve been thinking about it quite a bit over the last two years‚Ä¶. The current administration MUST BE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS in their actions against the American people.   Think about it this way; their support amongst the brainwashed American people must be undone before this country can safely move on from foreign interest corruption. As it stands, if the former administration/government were to act too soon, there would absolutely be a civil war and death on the streets.   There‚Äôs simply too much ignorant support of the authoritarian/fascist government coup.   The supporters consist of two peoples:  those who are fully aware of the coup and support it (white nationalists, Neo nazis, evangelicals, et al); and the ignorant that buy into the fear mongering propaganda being perpetuated by Fox News, MAGA, and the conservative movement in the U.S.    Not all of them are aware that their support for the current administration, is support for an active hostile takeover of the U.S.     There is a necessary threshold of pain against the American people that has to be reached before the hostile force working to dismantle the USA loses enough support for repair/justice/salvaging efforts can begin forcefully and openly.    I suspect we‚Äôll end up at some point soon with Neo-McCarthyism from both the left and the right to determine friend or foe amongst the population.      This will include data monitoring a‚Äôla the Patriot Act, and DOGE.   It‚Äôs unfortunate, but the enemy is walking amongst us and implanted in our communities.    What‚Äôs most important and most unfortunate for everyone right now, is to determine where your personal values lie. What you‚Äôre willing to fight for.  What you‚Äôre willing to die for. What you‚Äôre willing to kill for.    Do you value truth?  Do you value loyalty?  Do you value life?  Do you value freedom?  Do you value sovereignty over self?

"With how blatant and obvious the Heritage foundation has been, I have to hope and pray that the former administration worked with true patriots in the military and government to develop a plan to oust this administration once they become clearly enemies of the state.   I‚Äôve been thinking about it quite a bit over the last two years‚Ä¶. The current administration MUST BE BLATANTLY OBVIOUS in their actions against the American people.   Think about it this way; their support amongst the brainwashed American people must be undone before this country can safely move on from foreign interest corruption. As it stands, if the former administration/government were to act too soon, there would absolutely be a civil war and death on the streets.   There‚Äôs simply too much ignorant support of the authoritarian/fascist government coup.   The supporters consist of two peoples:  those who are fully aware of the coup and support it (white nationalists, Neo nazis, evangelicals, et al); and the ignorant that buy into the fear mongering propaganda being perpetuated by Fox News, MAGA, and the conservative movement in the U.S.    Not all of them are aware that their support for the current administration, is support for an active hostile takeover of the U.S.     There is a necessary threshold of pain against the American people that has to be reached before the hostile force working to dismantle the USA loses enough support for repair/justice/salvaging efforts can begin forcefully and openly.    I suspect we‚Äôll end up at some point soon with Neo-McCarthyism from both the left and the right to determine friend or foe amongst the population.

"There will be times when the struggle seems impossible. I know this already. Alone, unsure, dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.  Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they‚Äôve already enlisted in the cause.  Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.  And remember this: the Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.  Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empires‚Äôs authority and then there will be one too many.

The fact they haven't even ordered different protocols and restructuring of the systems is quite alarming. Instead, they fired the group investigating it.

"You missed the point.   I responded to someone who essentially said ""it's completely hopeless to try to do anything in the face of a fascist government. We should all give up and just let them do whatever they want,"" and I commented a pretty eloquent monologue from a very popular show that is explicitly about why it is important to not give up in the face of overwhelming odds.    I didn't just go ""Wow, this is just like Star Wars.""  I posted an excerpt from the political manifesto of the Star Wars Universe's leading antifascist writer.  I get that perhaps you personally would prefer all conversation about topics such as whether or not we should give up and let fascism win or attempt to resist be fully grounded in reality.

"> have no idea how we come back from it.   We use our voices, as insignificant as we might feel. If everyone does it, it quickly adds up.   * Call out these people for their shit in person, on social media, or however else you feel you can get your message across.   * Offer alternatives to their proposals, as well as criticisms.   * Get engaged in politics in whatever way you feel most comfortable. That could be something like more regularly engaging with you MP and councillors, supporting a particular cause, or even running in an election yourself.   I'd also **strongly** suggest reading Alasdair Campbell's book [""But what can I do?""](https://www.waterstones.com/book/but-what-can-i-do/alastair-campbell/9781529153330) It's rather apropriate given our current situation.   Personally, I'm slowly building a detailed proposal for a radical overhaul of our media (traditional and social) landscape that I hope to get in front of a couple of MPs. I don't expect it to be taken seriously, but hope it might spark deeper discussion on how to combat disinformation.",Nemisis_the_2nd,2025-05-02T14:04:00,2
