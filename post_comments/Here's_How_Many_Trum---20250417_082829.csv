"Liberals/leftists believe empathy is imagining if your mind was in the body of another person, and imagining what you'd do or think in their circumstance. This explains a lot of weird conclusions they end up at. They're bad at modeling other people's brains, or they don't even make an attempt to.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T12:14:51,8
Zero Trump voters think we would be better off under heels up Kamala. None.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-17T08:36:35,160
When there's no evidence to support what the left wants to be true they just make shit up. And of course most of the media runs with it verbatim.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-17T08:48:29,110
I'm starting to enjoy them doubling down on gaslighting and fear mongering .... Not learning from their mistakes is encouraging,indefiniteretrieval,2025-04-17T08:45:05,71

I wouldnâ€™t change my vote AND (cause this is the important part none of us were ever gonna vote for Kamala) Iâ€™m not mad at his actions and EOs. Matter of fact I fully support the administrations choices thus far and hope they keep going at this rapid fire pace. Letâ€™s get shit done!,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-17T09:35:25,21

"In other words, a wash.    Just as many Harris voters would have changed to Trump as Trump voters changed to Harris.  So then, Trump policies are just what the American people wanted overall.",mdws1977,2025-04-17T09:26:24,3

"Yep. I hope the Democrats just keep the fear going and not finding a decent candidate and the ""Orange Man Bad"" It's amazing they never thought gee maybe we shouldn't have nominated Hillary or let Kamala run",Crisgocentipede,2025-04-17T09:35:19,1

"I've been pretty critical of Trumps tariffs and the way he says some super dumb things, still am. And once in a while with Ukraine. I still wholeheartedly agree. Trump is still fine and loads better than a Democrat.",YesItIsAnAltAcc,2025-04-17T11:27:21,31

That lines up with polls regarding specific policies too. You'd think with all the protests from immigration to DOGE he'd be doing horrible. [The latest polls](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/political_updates/prez_track_apr17) show he's still at 50%,BulletBulletGun,2025-04-17T11:05:01,4
