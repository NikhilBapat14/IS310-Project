"If you‚Äôre referring to the classic Grand Ole Party, Barry Goldwater‚Äôs ‚ÄòConscience of a Conservative‚Äô Republican Party?  That GOP is dead and buried.  It zombified and became the Tea Party Trump Cult we are familiar with now.    The Trump Cult will find another demagogue to follow when Trump is gone or Trump‚Äôs puppet masters will make another one.

Obama wouldn't have done it anyway. He believes in the constitution of our nation and would never run for a third term because there can be only two terms. If it has to be consecutive well Trump's terms were not consecutive so that would exclude him as well.,Ipreferthedark,2025-04-05T04:13:36,8
"You've definitely got a point with how easily swindled the base is, hopefully we can start to see some cracks in that with how awful the economy is right now and will likely remain to be for the next three years as the boomers/gen Xers retire. That pain will be hard to ignore, and I personally am starting to see some questioning of the ""plan"" - but not enough. But yeah, rejecting the rise of the next cult leader would take a spine and some introspection - right now it's hard to see Trumpers having either when the time comes.",TheMemeStar24,2025-04-04T19:53:12,19
