Because Maher seems to grasp that it is possible to not like a politician’s policy without that person being Literally Hitler.,Frescanation,2025-05-01T16:56:09,53
"I do believe Maher says what he thinks regarding both parties. At least he met with Trump and reported a very positive experience as Trump the person. Depends what “shit show” means, but it certainly has not been boring.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-05-01T12:20:32,126
“Despite his friendly summit” just because Trump cracked a few jokes with Maher doesn’t mean he’ll turn around and support his agenda/accomplishments.,LS100,2025-05-01T15:03:47,35
"I mean... it has been a shit show.   SOO much has happened since then. So many lies and hoaxes, violence/vandalism, and meltdowns along with all that's going on with the world and economy, DOGE, immigration, etc.   But a shit show doesn't necessarily mean its bad. It just means it's all over the place. Which it has been.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-01T12:52:09,65
I think this is one of the indications that President Trump and his administration are doing the things they were voted for.,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-01T12:19:39,19

"I was gonna say this lol. Whether you agree or disagree it has certainly been a bumpy ride and definitely not boring.   Personally, I'm mostly supportive aside from the stupid Canada 51st state nonsense. Waiting on moves from Russia after the Ukraine deal and optimistic this stupid ass proxy war ends",Enchylada,2025-05-01T12:49:41,49
"Yah, hard to say that everything in this admin is buttoned up and thought out.  There has been a lot of shooting from the hip and breaking things to see how far and fast he can go.",Swagastan,2025-05-01T17:25:08,16
"That's true. That said, this shit show has to get cleaned up at some point. There needs to be improvements that come from all this chaos, and the window of patience for things to improve is short: He's got about a year. If things are like this next year, the Democrats are going to have an enormous amount of talking points in the midterms.",Antisocial_Worker7,2025-05-01T22:33:38,7
