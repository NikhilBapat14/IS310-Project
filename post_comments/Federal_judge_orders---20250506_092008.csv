"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I don’t think Griffin is going to win this. Griffin, contested the eligibility of certain voters. In fact, there were ballots cast that appear not to have met the requirements for being counted because they were missing certain required markings and/or fields. Unfortunately, that’s not the argument that Griffin presented. His argument hinges on a strange and inaccurate qualification that individuals serving abroad in the military must present a drivers license (in person) to vote which was never a requisite. Honestly, I’m flabbergasted he’d even attempt to make that case, especially in a state with a high ratio of active service military.  Ignoring Riggs for just a second, it’s rather disappointing that someone running for the NC Supreme Court would ignore a much stronger and more obvious case in favor of this argument which just isn’t supported by NC law… Griffin leaves quite a bit to be desired.",CamoAnimal,2025-05-06T11:37:17,224
"North Carolina just turned blue.  >*The other category of ballots that the appellate courts declared violated the state constitution were cast by overseas voters who have never lived in the U.S. but whose parents were declared North Carolina residents.*  It all boils down to state versus federal jurisdiction in the election involving a federal judge. The final tally wasn't in question, but the eligibility of non-residents voting in NC elections. If a federal judge has the power to overrule state appellate, then what are the limits of federal judges? That's something we need to talk about.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-06T10:04:08,89
Since when can a Judge order election results to be certified? Sounds like a total overreach at minimum. A total violation of the Law in reality.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T09:59:26,-82

Riggs is illegitimate and a new election should have been called at the very least.,SouthernNumismatist,2025-05-06T09:41:09,-119
"It's fine - we have a structural voting advantage with how the NC state legislature districts are drawn. It literally doesn't matter on state wide races - there's zero power remaining in the governor/lt gov/AG/state auditor roles.   All power resides the legislature, all we have to do is keep legislating and the courts can't stop us.",T0XxXiXiTy,2025-05-06T14:42:18,-22
If you’ve never held residency in a state you should not be allowed to vote in that state,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-07T07:52:27,4
"If the law sets out conditions for certification, and those conditions are satisfied, then a judge can decide that certification is required by law.   I don't know the details of the case, but it wouldn't surprise me if there were only specific and limited reasons to refuse to certify",woailyx,2025-05-06T10:18:17,244

"What? No. As someone in NC who voted for Griffin, this has nothing to do with Riggs’ legitimacy. There is absolutely zero need for a new election. I think you need to read up on the issue.",CamoAnimal,2025-05-06T11:27:24,161
