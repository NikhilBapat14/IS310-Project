"""working class""  yes  its language everyone understands.  ""bourgeoisie""  no,  its too academic, for a lot of conversations.    Typically in the us we just use blue collar and white collar and business owners.   so you can tell who works a manual job, an office job, or who owns businesses.      I think on reddit the term  ""bourgeoisie"" gets used so much everyone is well aware.  but it also comes with some baggage that we're probably about to hear about communism / socialism/  or food, housing, vacations are a human right.    maybe not vacations I'm exaggerating a little bit.

Are the traditional *names* for class like ""bourgeoisie"" applicable?  Personally, I wouldn't use them as they are anachronistic.  In 2025 they are more likely to cause meaningless quibble.

"I've often heard ""working class"" as a better term than ""middle class"". This works out largely because, despite a very wide range of incomes, people in the working class share a huge amount of overall needs/concerns. Those in the working class are people who wake up and go to work for someone else in order to survive. They all hope to some day enter the leisure class (retire) or possibly the owner class (investments, entrepreneurship, etc).",cballowe,2025-04-14T03:40:28,22

"The British still use ""working class"" all the time, and I have the impression that about half of all Americans who consider themselves middle class would be tagged as working class in the UK.  A British guy once told me ""in America, 'middle class' simply means 'average people'.""  I guess it does.  'Working class' sounds foreign and clunky to American ears.  I think of an old silent film from the 1920s, where factory workers in overalls are clambering around on a comically oversized gear assembly waving giant wrenches around as random jets of steam blast out in the background.    As for 'bourgeoisie.'  If it's an American using that word in a sentence, I think of someone who's been in academia since the 1970s, or a cultural critic for the New Yorker who was instructed by their editor to not use it more than once.",ColossusOfChoads,2025-04-15T02:02:38,2

"No, not really. American society is a lot more stratified than merely ""working class"" or ""bourgeoisie."" The history of this country shows as much. White working class people have different interests than Black or brown working class people. Some people want to talk about working class solidarity, but can't seem to understand that large amounts of working class people don't want unity with those whom they perceive as beneath them; nor would they want unity with those who *do* see them as inferior. A lot of white working class people, no matter how much they're struggling, will look at a poor Black person and conclude the reason he's poor is because he's lazy or on welfare. They'll see a rich, successful Black man and think that he only got where he was through handouts or ""DEI."" Given this understanding of the world, I ask you, why would a Black working class person want to unite with someone who sees them as inferior, no matter what? Until these layers of American society are settled, there can be no working class solidarity.   Furthermore, if a politician in America ever unironically uses the word ""bourgeoisie"" in a campaign, they'll end up alienating just about everybody except a bunch of 20-year-old humanities majors. Regular people hear a politician use that word and their only takeaway will be ""This guy thinks he's better than me.""",AntarcticScaleWorm,2025-04-13T23:51:54,7

"Americans don’t know what “bourgeosie” means. And everyone disagrees about what words like “working class” or “middle class” even mean.  *Working class* seems like it would encompass any worker, but what its users actually mean (I think) is manufacturing or service jobs involving the use of labor. Waiters are working class but secretaries aren’t. Or maybe they are. They don’t mean people in the so-called knowledge economy—or maybe they do? Because it’s unclear, the term is meaningless.   Equally meaningless is *middle class*. Survey data suggest what economic class Americans think they belong to has more to do with how they feel than how much money they make. Surveys also show that Americans overestimate whether they’re middle class. In a low cost of living area, an annual income of $100,000 might make you “upper class.” In a high cost of living area, it might not.",Leopold_Darkworth,2025-04-14T14:12:17,1
"""Appropriate"" is kind of the wrong question to ask. A better question would be to ask if it's *effective*. To which I'd have to say no. That word is tied up in a very specific context of Marx's depiction of capitalism.  To be completely honest - Marxism's idea of capitalism has never truly described American capitalism to begin with. People are a lot more fully bought into the system at all levels, and class boundaries aren't well-enforced. That is not to say a lot of the inequality he described doesn't exist here, it absolutely does.

"I think the biggest problem with utilizing these terms in the American context is that *way* more people see themselves as members of the ""working class"" than are actually members. A lot of Americans think they're ""working class"" when realistically they're not beyond the literal ""they go to work every day.""  It makes class consciousness extremely difficult when people have a hard time understanding where they even are on the ladder.  I think another uniquely American problem is everybody who does recognize their position in the class hierarchy as being lower thinks that that position is temporary. The saying that Americans think of themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires speaks to that in that Americans tend to have a misplaced sense of optimism about upward mobility which makes organizing along class lines very hard.  Nobody wants to organize against the interests of the rich because they think *they* will be rich someday and they don't want anything cramping their style.",HeloRising,2025-04-14T18:40:15,1

"I think one of the big problems with blue collar vs white collar workers as descriptors is that it tends to be a dividing description with individualistic connotations. Working class implies a collective, owning class might be a good alternative for bourgeoise since functionally that’s what it means.   But also I don’t think your comment specifically is as egregiously individualist-brained as many of the comments of this thread are. “Middle class” is a description I hate; I did grow up in a family that was considered “middle class” by economic standards, but middle class is a very nothingburger descriptor because of how broad and ever-expanding it is (because everyone wants to think of themselves as middle class), and class isn’t based on money but based on your labor relations. So the fact that in the US the narrative of “class” has been based on a measurement of income says a lot about the priorities of our society lol.   But now that I think about it, white collar workers do fit somewhat in the category of labor aristocracy, the segment of the working class that gets higher wages and is more comfortable with the status quo than with the idea of aligning with the poorer segments of the working class in solidarity against the bourgeoise. But they are still working class, because both an average proletarian and a labor aristocrat have to sell their labor to the classes that own the means of production.   Middle class is a useless term for describing class dynamics because it’s all encompassing of anyone in a certain financial range rather than describing their relations to labor. Both the labor aristocracy and petite bourgeoise fit firmly into the “middle class,” yet they have entirely different relations to labor. In fact, a labor aristocrat could even be “upper middle class” by American definitions, making like $200k or something, while the petite bourgeoise may be considered “lower class” simply because their business isn’t profitable.   I’m a Marxist so of course these pretentious ass terms all are things I use and understand, but I do agree that we should find a way to make these concepts more acceptable to the average American who’s been taught anti-communism all their life. Not even for ideological purposes but so they can better understand their relations to production and understand *who* the elites are rather than some “mysterious force” or whoever Trump decides is an elite (which I believe in their minds may describe intellectual or cultural elitism rather than large business owners exploiting them for profit)   The reason these terms are still used by certain segments of people is because of how descriptive they are. This is the hurdle we need to overcome to build solidarity. I like some of the symbolic stuff like “the 99%” because of the solidarity that it brings (might be because Occupy happened during my political awakening in my youth) but even that is non-descriptive and leaves room that if we topple some of the big dogs, someone else will just take their place.",atoolred,2025-04-14T11:08:23,0

"spot on with the middle class comment.   yeah its very broad and everyone tends to think of themselves that way.   people a bit under the income threshold would just say they are lower middle class, and rich people almost never think of themselves as rich.  in the book ""Richistanis"" they found that someone with 25 million would describe rich as having 50 million, then they asked people with 50 million and you guessed it, they thought rich was 100 million.      And again you nailed it,  some people (Marxist or not) are very comfortable with the terms but they are even more broad than middle class.   at least with middle class it indicates there's an upper and lower class, but simply diving everyone into worker or business owner is silly in today's era.  Maybe when Marx was alive  every worker had close to the same living standard, but there's so many factors today.      Like Me buying a cheaper car, and having bought a house when prices were low, and refinanced at ultra low rates has me paying 1500 a month for housing and transportation.    And I've got co-workers who make a bit more than me but rent for 3k a month and i'm guessing also has a $300 or higher car payment.      that's going to affect our disposable income more.      It might make more sense to look at disposable income categories.   People who can spend $100, $500, 1K   after payday with out having to go with out, or have a credit card balance that will be hard to pay off.      People who are really comfortable (financially) even if not rich are going to hear and react to messages differently.   Like when I heard people rail against billionaires It really falls on deaf ears.  or if they try to tell me capitalism is so bad.   I'm doing totally fine, and never had any windfalls or major events of fortune.      I moved several states over, got a job and things just worked out for me, so for better or for worse I'm going to think that people in general can have things work out for them too  if they are ""working / middle class""  to use the near useless terms.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-14T11:32:29,2

">Class and income level are not the same thing. Class is more of a culture developed around time spend at a certain income level around people of the same income level.   ""Class"" in a Marxist analysis is just your relations to the means of production. Whenever you occupy a certain type of relation to them, you are part of a certain class.   ""Proletariat"" in general are people who, in the capitalist mode of production, have nothing to sell to sustain themselves but their labor. ""Bourgeoisie"" in general are those who have the ability to sell or rent out property as their primary means of supporting themselves. Bourgeoisie are usually some kind of capitalist, or otherwise very close to becoming one.  ""Capitalists"" are divided into a few major categories, but they are generally understood as the class of people who employ proletariat/workers to develop and finish products at their discretion, then pocket the money from the sale of those products on the market.   The point being that workers who are employed by a capitalist or, perhaps more appropriately in modern times, the managers working on behalf of the capitalist, are themselves alienated from the product of their labor. They don't get to own the things they make, and instead must accept a wage or salary as compensation for the *time* they spent laboring. They never get to self direct their labor in such an arrangement, and they don't get to profit in the same way the capitalist does in the market.   In this way, a class division emerges in society and continues to develop in new ways over history, with many sub classes appearing that challenge that main division but which have yet to totally subvert it.   By that analysis, you have more in common with someone else who has nothing to sell but their labor than someone who can sell or rent property to sustain themselves.",Gruzman,2025-04-14T11:24:32,2

"These things have been present since day one, it's how the system is *supposed* to function. The economic system is built around the exploitation of surplus value, and the political one around the protection of property rights. To keep the former going has required an empire, outsourcing the worst of that exploitation in exchange for greater profit and a wealthy citizenry, and the latter has always required input from the leaders of industry before the democracy.   The US has always been rife with contradictions, and not just saying ""all men are created equal"" while owning slaves. In 1900 the Democratic party platform was against annexing the Phillipines because they're not white and thus can't be civilians, and if you annex them without making them civilians, we become what Britain was. Thus clearly what ought to be done in the Caribbean and Latin America is indirect or temporary control of their governments, because we want their labor and natural resources (United Fruit running Guatemala, the Navy ran Cuba from 1898-1902, and so on) and because we don't want them ever allied with Europe (Monroe Doctrine). This practice expanded globally after WWII and into the cold war. We're a democracy, but Allen Dulles never asked anyone how much murder they were okay with to keep bananas at ten cents a pound, and there's never anything more than an oblique reference to those calculations in any party platform. Even that Adam Smith quote (leaving aside how actually capitalist he is) gives away the game. *American* society can succeed by that measure, raise the top marginal tax rate back to 1950s levels and see to people's welfare, but they cannot do that without the immigrant farmers working for $2 an hour, the cheap manufacturing in Asia, the raw materials flowing from cheap (or even enslaved) labor in Africa. Americans are not totally unaware of this. I believe I saw a black member of the Democratic party say the other day something to the effect of ""hey immigrants are actually okay, because you're not getting *me* back on the plantation"". People are okay with picking and choosing who fits in ""society"", because the alternative they can't consider is that out of season produce and fast fashion and new smartphones every year etc etc are not available without this exclusion. But these calculations which are hazy for the democratic populace are explicit, rational, and calculated for the capitalist class, and reflected clearly in American foreign and domestic policy. Whether or not the US is at a given moment more or less conservative regarding the welfare of its own citizens, the policy is consistent with regard to that outgroup, because ultimately the range of outcomes for the average American is immaterial; the exploitation that must be protected at all costs is that of the outgroup. That's why union busting is so easy, why the cold war was such a priority, and why many communists view China's labor practices with suspicion (although perhaps the long game is working!).   That exploitation has to happen *somewhere* or the whole thing falls apart, and that exploitation will never be controlled democratically; if you give all the workers a voice, they're not going to conclude that the majority of their production should go to the minority.

I mean. My conservative parents and teachers also instilled equality in me, but that doesn't change that they both very much are opposed to any meaningful equality via their support for Donald Trump, and I'd argue that this is pretty consistent with the conservative ideology historically. It has always been the conservative position that there be immutable class distinctions, they have consistently fought for the aristocracy and, way back when, the monarchy - now they fight for strong centrally authoritative leadership and aren't big on checks on power any stuff (pretty monarch-pilled still). The social hierarchy, usually built along racial and religious axes, is pretty central to the ideology.  So like yeah, I feel where the other guy is coming from - ""equality"" as a ""conservative value"" is a wild take. That aspect of the Declaration of Independence was radical and decidedly anti-conservative for its time *and still kind of is*, the old aristocracy still exists in Europe, and often still has a great deal of power.
