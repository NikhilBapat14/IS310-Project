"A young entrepreneur who was among the earliest known recruiters for Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has a new, related gig—and he’s hiring. Anthony Jancso, cofounder of AcclerateX, a government tech startup, is looking for technologists to work on a project that aims to have artificial intelligence perform tasks that are currently the responsibility of tens of thousands of federal workers.  Jancso, a former Palantir employee, wrote in a Slack with about 2000 Palantir alumni in it that he’s hiring for a “DOGE orthogonal project to design benchmarks and deploy AI agents across live workflows in federal agencies,” according to an April 21 post reviewed by WIRED. Agents are programs that can perform work autonomously.  “We’ve identified over 300 roles with almost full process standardization, freeing up at least 70k FTEs for higher-impact work over the next year,” he continued, essentially claiming that tens of thousands of federal employees could see many aspects of their job automated and replaced by these AI agents. Workers for the project, he wrote, would be based on site in Washington, DC, and would not require a security clearance; it isn’t clear for whom they would work. Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.  The post was not well received. Eight people reacted with clown face emojis, three reacted with a custom emoji of a man licking a boot, two reacted with custom emoji of Joaquin Phoenix giving a thumbs down in the movie *Gladiator*, and three reacted with a custom emoji with the word “Fascist.” Three responded with a heart emoji.

"Businesses aren't exactly having great success yet replacing everyone with the AI bots, so if companies can't do that and save money why would they expect the government to be able to do so?  It would make more sense if you let the corporations get that concept working first, and only after you see what works, adopt some of the ideas for the government. Trying to force it through by political fiat make no sense, because if it was a good money-saving idea, companies would already have done that.",cipheron,2025-05-02T11:45:10,6

"I work on an AI heavy team, albeit mostly productivity focused. While it certainly saves me time on my day to day tasks, especially learning on the fly...we are not at the point that this spoken about Automation is reliable. It is certainly coming, but it will still need humans behind the curtain for some time. And even then, I still think it's just going to create new roles and jobs.",Prayer_Warrior21,2025-05-02T12:03:08,1
"I was going to write a pithy response, but it occurred to me that perhaps it would be more appropriate for that job to be outsourced.   So, in honor of AI taking over fucking everything, here is ChatGPT's response  to the question...  ""How can AI taking over government functions fuck things up?""  • Bias and Discrimination: AI systems trained on biased data can make unfair decisions, especially in areas like criminal justice, immigration, or social services—amplifying systemic racism or inequality.  • Lack of Transparency: Many AI systems are ""black boxes,"" meaning it's hard to explain how they reached a decision. This lack of accountability is a problem in a democratic system that values transparency.  • Overreliance and Automation Bias: Government officials might place too much trust in AI recommendations, ignoring human judgment or context, which can lead to flawed or unjust outcomes.  • Privacy Violations: Surveillance systems powered by AI (like facial recognition) can easily overstep constitutional boundaries, especially the Fourth Amendment, leading to mass surveillance or wrongful targeting  • Security Risks: Poorly designed or inadequately secured AI systems can be hacked, manipulated, or exploited by adversaries, posing national security risks.  • Job Displacement: Automating government services can reduce public sector jobs, disproportionately affecting lower-income workers and communities  • Undermining Democratic Processes: If AI is used in political analysis, voter targeting, or misinformation campaigns, it can distort elections or public opinion.   • Mission Creep: AI tools introduced for one purpose (e.g., counterterrorism) might be gradually expanded into areas where they don’t belong, with fewer checks and balances",FredUpWithIt,2025-05-02T12:02:07,1

"Palantir alumni. Always comforting to know the work is being done by a Thiel acolyte. I'm sure it will turn out great.   Just as I'm sure they fully grasp the true extent of each one of those workflows in federal agencies.   Maybe they can prove they grasp workflows by taking over the VA's Oracle Cerner EHRM roll outs. If they can make that go smoothly for let's say 20 sites over the next two years, then maybe they can play with AI.   On a more serious and practical side, how much is this going to cost? Even after the training process, my understanding is there a huge energy demand to terms of both compute power and cooling. ",StickaFORKinMyEye,2025-05-02T13:37:19,5
so basicly have ai replace people to save money. and if that ai goes rogue it destroys mankind.,saiyanscaris,2025-05-02T11:38:44,8
Well the guy who runs DOGE owns an AI company.  I wonder which company will get the contract?  Grok doesn't have an agent yet as far as I'm aware but that won't matter for corruption purposes,JojenCopyPaste,2025-05-02T12:36:54,4
Because they don't care if government is no longer functional. We won't be able to simply take our business to a competitor who actually works. We just have to live with less to no service for a higher cost.   Instead our tax dollars will play for doge to use the government to work things out. Then give the technology to the tech broligarcs to make even more money.   Win-win    Unless you are anyone other than an oligarch. Or a trump getting kickbacks from them.,StickaFORKinMyEye,2025-05-02T13:22:14,1

"I was testing out some landing page stuff, and used ChatGPT to help with some coding to get an embedded map to work right since I was just laying things out before submitting things to be worked on. It kept messing up, and no matter how many times I told it the issue that was going on, or the new issues that popped up with the new code it gave me, it couldn’t solve it and kept creating new issues to where it got worse and lost functionality… for something a junior coder could have knocked out in about 5 minutes.  But sure, AI is totally ready to replace important government jobs, go team go!",flirtmcdudes,2025-05-02T14:54:13,1
That was Musk's plan all along. Not the overthrowing of mankind part but to hoover up all the data and let a random number generator run the country. A random number generator most likely owned by Musk.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-02T12:10:17,3

"Exactly. I generally use it to give me a baseline script or output, but I still have to know the syntax to get it over the finish line, whether that is guiding it or finishing it by hand.
