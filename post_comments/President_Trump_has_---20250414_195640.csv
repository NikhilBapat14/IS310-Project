"SC won’t allow it, but Trump and his team will scoff at the SC and will do it regardless.",Weyman16,2025-04-14T19:59:44,1082
"I think the larger question is ""if SCOTUS doesn't allow Trump to do something, what are the impacts?""  SCOTUS  has confirmed the only way to punish a president is by impeachment, so as it stands currently Trump can (eith his majority in the House and Senate) ignore any SCOTUS order and not woret about consequences as he is sure that he will not be impeached.    I truly believe that when POTUS starts to deport US citizens and he is told to stop, our congress will defend him stating thst these are the most violent criminals and they can be sent anywhere to serve their sentences.  When Trump leaves office he will face charges that when they reach SCOTUS  they will shrug and say he should have been impeached.  Right now he is free to do basically anything.",Eyruaad,2025-04-14T20:03:54,317

"This may be wishful thinking, but I suspect that the Supreme Court may draw a line here.  My reason isn't so wishful.  Judges in American courts are highly protective of their authority.  Snub one of their rulings or act out of order in their presence, and they will predictably get agitated about it.  This is true across the spectrum.  Federal or state/local.  Liberal, conservative, or anywhere in between: Piss off a judge and you're hosed.  I believe that they may start holding these DOJ lawyers in contempt and fining them personally for every day that their orders are defied.  The Supreme Court will back them on this because they also don't like their rulings being disrespected.  What they won't want is another branch of government treating them as if they have no power.  Judges can often be petty and that is usually a bad thing.  This is where it may do some good.  EDIT: A CNN interview posted today.  This retired federal district court judge is commenting about the potential for the district court to find contempt, etc.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQY6VjwGa0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQY6VjwGa0)  EDIT 2:  Abrego's counsel is requesting contempt.  The judge is starting the discovery process. Depositions are anticipated.  I would expect this to not go well for DOJ.  I would expect sanctions and the basis being established for civil trials being filed against the individuals involved.  Pardons won't allow them to avoid civil litigation.

If Clarence Thomas.  Ahem.  Need to restart that thought…..  If Clarence Thomas was one of the 9-0 Supreme Court justices to unanimously state that a legal immigrant with a constitutional right to live and work in the U.S. was wrongly deported and the executive branch must facilitate his return:  Then I have a glimmer of hope at least SCOTUS has a limit with Trump fuckery.,cycleaccurate,2025-04-14T20:18:44,55

The SC gave him the power to defy them and now he is defying them. The SC’s power has been castrated.,CinnamonToastFecks,2025-04-14T20:38:44,14
At this point it doesn't matter what the Supreme Court allows. Trump has proven that he can defy their orders and if his party never calls him out he'll get away with it. The SC can make whatever decisions they want but it's not like Kavanaugh and Thomas are going to march their happy asses into the Oval Office and call Trump out. There have been literally a thousand things Trump has done that he shouldn't be able to but the Republican party won't reign him in. When almost everyone in his party is enabling his power trip there's almost nothing to stop him.,stantheman1976,2025-04-14T20:44:53,11

"At this point, I think the real question is whether the people of these United States will allow it. If a government can ship you off to another country without leaving you so much as a ghost of your civil rights to keep you company, what exactly does it even mean to call yourself a citizen of that land?  I don’t think a violent response is the answer, but I do think a peaceful but comprehensive and absolute protest would be in order.

"The SC won’t allow it, and the Trump admin will do it anyway until we impeach and criminally charge them all.   The SC isn’t “allowing” them to leave our Maryland father, Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported there either. Garcia even had a court protection order in place to PREVENT his deportation, and the Trump admin deported him and is leaving him there anyway.

"They had proposed a way to get around this, they can make a portion of the prisons a US territory and then it's not deportation. Hence, they can then send US citizens there without calling it deportation, kinda like Guantamo, how it's Cubas but we maintain jurisdiction. So we will have our own El Salvador prisons for people Trump doesn't like.

Violating the constitution and throwing away our democracy will quickly illegitimate this administration and we could be heading into something far more volatile and possibly violent.  If this administration pushes it further, I honestly see a few outcomes. One where we turn into an authoritarian regime where protesters could indeed be sent to off-country prison (violent in one way I guess).  The other one would be where the judiciary (SCOTUS) challenges the executive and go full force. Without the support of legislative branch, impeachment would be unlikely.  Third is the case where the rising concerns in authoritarianism forces liberal states to declare state of emergency and we head into a civil war, which is unlikely but where we are was also very unlikely event. Some of these democrat politicians would actually need to risk it all and grow some back bones and put it all on the line for democracy.

They made it easier for republicans to point fingers at given so many questionable practices from the likes of Nancy Pelosi and what not.  The fourth is that citizens revolt against tyranny like we did against the British. This would require a central leadership that would lead this effort, which is highly unlikely in American culture. It would also require citizens to be educated and smart.

They said all they will do is allow him in with his renewed legal status if he can make it to the boarder, that's where they will stop. Nothing more than letting him in if he can make it back.

But the reality is they would act the same way with any other excuses available or no excuse at all.    The reality is, it's very unlikely in today's climate for either side to remove their own party's sitting president.",skratchx,2025-04-15T02:11:59,2

"US Marshalls carry out judges orders but they also report to the DOJ which is technically under the executive branches purview. I would be very surprised if judges could deputize a 3rd party to carry out orders that the Marshalls ""should"" be doing. By then we are well on our way for bigger political fracturing/disruption of current system of government.",thatdude858,2025-04-15T17:34:25,2

"Mentioning the political aspect of a political process is not moving the goalposts. It’s further explanation of why the process has become harder. I clearly never said Congress couldn’t impeach the president anymore. In fact, I said the exact opposite and acknowledged that the process is still a possibility.  The constitution lays out the justifications for impeachment so the articles of impeachment must meet at least one of those justifications. The expansion of presidential immunity objectively reduces the number of actions that could be considered for articles of impeachment. Congress can’t just impeach for any reason and without justification. The fact that you thought Congress could do that shows how little you actually understand the process.",jamvsjelly23,2025-04-14T22:27:16,-3
"Nope.     The reason they started using troopers is because the President can federalize already called out NG units at the stroke of a pen, whereas actually calling them out as a federalized force is much more legally involved. The turning point was the Little Rock school desegregation mess in 1957, which saw the AR NG called out by Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus in order to support his goal of maintaining segregated schools, federalized by Eisenhower due to Faubus dragging his feet on compliance and ordered back into the barracks over possible loyalty issues (they were replaced with federal regulars charged with enforcing *Brown* v. *Board*) and then ultimately redeployed in order to enforce *Brown* after the federal regulars were withdrawn.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-15T00:39:19,3
"I'm not a politician - I'm just a dude on Reddit.   People who voted third party, stayed home, or (god-forbid) voted for Trump need to take a hard look in the mirror and try to understand how they got it so badly wrong. Those people actively helped a fascist gain power. To unseat him may ultimately require mass protest and civil disobedience (if not worse). And what was the alternative? Cringe, woke black lady.   Get a damn grip and realize the stakes of your political decisions. This isn't a game. Withholding your vote doesn't make you cool or buy you leftist brownie points.

"You're incorrectly combining legal justifications with political viability which are two very different things.  The phrase ""high Crimes and Misdemeanors"" is deliberately broad and left to Congress to define. The judiciary cannot overrule their interpretation. That’s been settled since Nixon v. United States. Congress can impeach for any reason it sees fit under that umbrella even if you or I disagree with it.  You're also misstating what presidential immunity affects. The Court’s decision impacts criminal prosecution, not Congress’s independent power to impeach. The House can still draft articles of impeachment for conduct it finds unacceptable. Immunity might block a courtroom, but not Congress.  Impeachment doesn’t require a crime and never has. That’s not my opinion, that’s constitutional law and precedent. If anything, trying to squeeze impeachment into a prosecutorial framework is what shows a fundamental misunderstanding on your part.  You’re welcome to argue about what Congress should consider impeachable, that’s a political question. But don’t confuse that with what the constitution allows.",ODoyles_Banana,2025-04-14T22:45:07,19
"Where does the Constitution explicitly say that Bill Clinton couldn’t get a blowie from a staffer? That was consensual and not even a crime and Congress impeached anyway. Trump has already been impeached more than any other president. Maybe the third time will be the charm and he will actually be removed from office. But they are correct — Congress can impeach for anything they deem to be misconduct. It doesn’t have to be in violation of the Constitution or any other laws. It just so happens that there are a multitude of reasons they **could** choose to impeach Trump for that are, in fact, violations of the Constitution or other federal laws. The immunity decision was written to prevent a future DoJ from prosecuting a former president for anything that falls under “official acts” so yeah, it was still a get out jail free card for Trump and would still be in a future timeline where he gets impeached, convicted, and removed, so far as if they did choose to impeach him for something that violated the law, the power of Congress ends at removal from office and the DoJ could not bring actual criminal charges….. **IF** it also falls under “official acts” of the office of the President.",CremePsychological77,2025-04-15T01:42:26,4
