"Maybe they did and maybe it worked to plan.   How much would you say 100,000 jobs should cost? That’s a significant portion of America. That’s the population of the capitol of Illinois all becoming unemployed within 90 days.   We let a car manufacturer end work from home: increasing commute for car owners  We let an internet provider: install and access internal servers and harvest data   We let an AI owner: access and harvest data  We let a rocket company owner: in the room during the selection of his competition for NASA   Elon under investigation for consumer fraud: dismantled CFPB  Elon under investigation by NLRB: dismantled  Elon under investigation for tax fraud: dismantle corporate tax department of IRS  Elon heavily involved with foreign interest including Chinese: dismantle soft power with USAID; increasing Chinese position as dominating global superpower    At the *very least* Elon Musk committed multiple acts of ethics violations, likely unconstitutionally. At the very most *it’s outright treason and theft* to a scale we can not fully understand. Data harvesting is what makes Google, Facebook, and Apple lucrative businesses. They are all monopolies, but still had to create a product to get the data they sell. DOGE just got unfettered access, while providing nothing.   Elon Musk should undoubtably be in prison for the rest of his life. His companies and assets should be seized by the United States and we should all receive payments on what was stolen from us.

"The plan all along wasn't cost savings. That is what it was sold as to swing voters and die-hard MAGAts. And they fell for it.  The plan all along for DOGE, is Project 2025's plan (DOGE is just the forward facing entity doing it). Project 2025 plan is to bust up Government agencies to allow corporations, mainly fossil fuels, bigAg, bigPharm, bigTech etc free reign to do whatever they want and thus boost profits and destroy competition. Many of these companies are in Elon's tech circle, others are being supported by massive lobbyist efforts....think massive multi-national conglomerates.   Ron Vara (I mean Peter Navarro)'s trade policies on the surface appear that it will decimate corporate profits, but as we saw during covid, inflation benefits corporations and those entities which can control pricing, it decimates those who are beholden to corporate pricing like the middle class/working class and the poor. The corporations and investors and rich get richer and more wealthy. The middle class/working class and the poor will see their buying power erode (the usual story).  What I am afraid of is that the damage that's being done on all fronts, isn't that it will take generations to repair and rebuild....it's that it will never be able to repair and rebuild. And that this could be the end of US world commerce and financial domination, something that last several generations have immensely benefitted from and taken for granted",RJ5R,2025-04-27T11:44:28,5

If it was really about reducing waste fraud and abuse, Trump wouldn't have fired the IGs. And he would have had forensic auditors with expertise and careful methods to go through each agency--with cooperation and oversight, not locking people out and defying Congress.

"You 👏 Don't 👏 Save 👏 Money 👏 By 👏 Firing 👏 People 👏. You reduce scope, or you do some substitution of outputs.

We have entitlement programs that don't work as well, hurting the american people.  Add up all of those harms, and put a dollar amount on them. Then, subtract that from what DOGE saved.

"[The BBC did a pretty good analysis](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4j33klz33o). DOGE has claimed some of its biggest savings by cancelling contracts and assessing them at the maximum figure listed in the contract,  when the contract hasn't been fulfilled. ""So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending."" They even included previously cancelled contracts. The IRS had one with an IT company  for $1.9bn; it was already cancelled by the Biden administration, and $0 had been spent. One contract it lists hasn't even been cancelled;  $1.74bn was supposedly saved from a global health company that helps get access to vaccines. They'd already gotten just $880 million; but they had not been notified their contract had been cancelled- with USAID activities being handed to the State Dept., perhaps it's still going.  Of course, carefully assessing costs and figuring savings for these huge contracts  would take a long time- many months, even years- and take staff.  Remember when Musk bought Twitter and fired everyone, even the security staff at the Twitter headquarters, with the result that no one left had access codes to get into the building? He's doing it again. Even though the government payroll is only about 6% of its expenses, they're firing all the people who could figure this out. Instead, they're just making up numbers to keep the mad emperor happy..",Bodark43,2025-04-27T08:05:47,55

And by artificially destroying demand, they’re slashing the price that farmers will get on what they still can still sell.

"“But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty's figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions. Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled. In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.”  - George Orwell, 1984",X_SkillCraft20_X,2025-04-27T18:16:31,7

"The bible contains 1,200 pages yet that gets ""quoted"" all the time by the Christian nationalists. Sounds to me like there are people lazy about their civil duty. At least when their rights are taken away they won't have any civil duty to worry about. Even their dear leader was quoted saying they wouldn't have to vote again.",NWHipHop,2025-04-27T17:07:37,5

There's probably less than a 1% chance the 99% wins this one. Propaganda is too effective when the targets are that dumb,RUB_MY_RHUBARB,2025-04-27T08:21:31,3

I like the part of the bible where white MAGA Jesus buys a gun because it's his 2nd amendment right and then he tells the brown immigrants to get the fuck out of his country because they aren't welcome. Then he holds a sermon about the evils of socialism.   /s,Rich-Pomegranate1679,2025-04-27T18:23:43,5
"""The Bible contains 1200 pages....""  Thanks for making my point. They don't read that either. I really don't understand these people and their dear leader cult around such an unworthy man. I've tried to understand it because I'm sure that not everyone is stupid. But....I don't.",FIlm2024,2025-04-27T19:03:32,3
