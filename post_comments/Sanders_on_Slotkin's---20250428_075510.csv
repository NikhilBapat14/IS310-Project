"She doesn't think Americans are too dumb to understand oligarchy. She just doesn't want Americans to talk about oligarchy because her donors don't want Americans to talk about oligarchy. People, including too many in this sub, need to realize not all Democrats are on the same team.",toaster_toaster,2025-04-28T08:04:55,33
I mean they voted for Trump twice so I disagree with him on that…,BoredCrusader1899,2025-04-28T08:09:43,6
"November 5, 2024 proved that at least 77,302,580 of them are indeed dumb.",nwgdad,2025-04-28T08:34:47,5
"What Slotkin should of done , is explain what the word means if she thinks it's too much to handle. How hard would it be ? American citizens, and country run by the rich is called a oligarchy. See ?",dmp2you,2025-04-28T09:09:08,5
"I love Bernie, but Id advocate for some dumbing. The base may look it up and think they understand, but the next levels out wont. I have been watching AOC and Bernie on their tour and my only criticism is use of big words.",katiescasey,2025-04-28T12:32:02,1

"Americans elected Trump twice.  They're not dumb, no - they are much, much worse than just ""dumb.""",Fillerbear,2025-04-28T09:10:39,1

"reducing the support of fascism in this country to raw, inexplicable stupidity isn't helpful nor is it accurate. theyre not stupid. theyre racist (or willing to overlook racism) and/or they hate the status quo. dismissing every trump voter as a drooling caveman is a dumb move because that later group could be swayed just as easily by left-populism. in my experience theyre just as willing to put up with progressive ideas as they are fascism, long as you bother to promise a future.",whycarbon,2025-04-28T08:52:49,3
"> long as you bother to promise a future.  That is exactly why they are stupid.  All you have to do is make unkept promises.  They cannot distinguish between truth and obvious lies.  Nor can they, nor are they willing to, understand the impacts of tariffs, climate change, and threatening the annexation/invasion of our closest allies.",nwgdad,2025-04-28T09:06:08,3
"that kind of thinking is universal. do you think democrats (or anyone) is immune to it? if so, you're getting got yourself.",whycarbon,2025-04-28T09:49:55,1
  > that kind of thinking is universal. Continuing to be taken in by obvious lies and unkept promises is not universal.  It only happens in cults (i.e. religion and politics).   > Do you think democrats (or anyone) is immune to it?  Those of us who are willing to be vaccinated against deadly diseases appear to have a greater immunity to cult thinking than those who refuse.,nwgdad,2025-04-28T09:59:39,2
