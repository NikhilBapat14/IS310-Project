"Here's a general breakdown for anyone who's uncertain:   We obviously need to wait until the midterms. We have the two special elections to fill the seats of Raúl Grijalva (Arizona's 7th district) and Sylvester Turner (Texas' 18th district), both of whom passed away this year. Both of these are safely Democratic districts, so the House ratio will be 215-220. Of course, the bigger challenge is the Senate. 67 votes in favor of conviction are required for removal, and right now there are 45 Democrats, 2 Independents (both of whom will obviously vote for removal), and 53 Republicans. Four Democrats and Mitch McConnell have announced their retirement, so those five seats are up for grabs. 22 Republicans and 12 Democrats are running for reelection. The website [racetothewh.com](http://racetothewh.com) puts 11 of these seats in the ""Safe Red"" category, meaning they are almost certain to win reelection (except for McConnell's seat in Kentucky). Even if we're being as generous as possible and say that all the other seats go to Democrats and all the Democrats keep their seats, that would still be 58 Democrats and Independents to 42 Republicans. Then, it would take the convincing of nine Republicans to vote for removal.   I apologize if this post came off as wordy and disheartening, but I want to make it clear that the road isn't easy, but I think it can be done.",MHAfan2006,2025-04-28T15:05:20,15

"Here’s my painfully optimistic opinion/prediction, trump will be impeached and removed from office within the next 6 months at the rate he is going. The people in power don’t care about trump beyond his ability to control masses as well as to do their bidding. From what I have seen I believe he has multiple contradictory benefactors who have some power over him, and in his attempts to appease all of them he will make himself useless to all of them. Mix that with the tariff fuck up and the soon coming empty shelves and the Litany of buffoons who squawk in his ear and the fact that he seems to listen to whoever glazed him and conversed with him most recently will result in a catastrophic implosion, with the republicans agreeing to impeach as long as they are able to maintain some form of power. The congress and senate majority’s may be swayed to a democratic majority if we decide to convict the criminals in both houses, and JD Vance would ascend to the presidency as a husk and a powerless leader. Even without a sway in the houses the infighting would destroy the party and JD Vance wouldn’t last long either. Obviously optimistic thinking but regardless as long as we the American people keep our foot on the gas I think we will be fine after some medium- heavy turmoil.

Primates are social animals and they naturally gravitate toward the most powerful members of the troop.    So doing things that display your weakness will cause you to lose support in the group. Doing things that display your strength will cause you to gain support.    Let's talk about impeachments. There are two steps to an impeachment One of them is for the House to initiate the process of impeachment, and the second one is for the Senate to hold the trial and vote whether to convict.   If you hold a Senate vote and you lose then **you are demonstrating your weakness**. You wasted everybody's time and gotten everybody all excited and then you lose.   So the Democrats should not attempt an impeachment _unless they are very confident they can win a conviction in the Senate_, otherwise this wastes a lot of effort and undermines their support.      I am fed up with empty gesture politics that only serve to display the weakness of the left.  Only doing impeachment if you are confident you can win.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T15:51:15,1

"This is a trash angle. AVOID THIS MINDSET AT ALL COSTS.   I'm sorry but liberals just only know how to lose elections.  If you want to keep losing elections, waste your time on prosecuting your political opponents. Even if your opponents did break the law, most people see a distinction without a difference, since everyone kind of appreciates that politicians are messy and corrupt. Only the jury will really understand the specifics of why someone violated a law...and it takes DAYS or WEEKS sitting in a court room to convince them most times. The conservatives are doing the same thing - prosecuting/investigating their political enemies (whether or not this is justified). Notice: it's not winning them any votes, either.  Meanwhile independents whose votes the dems desperately need if they ever want to win back control literally just want to see politicians focusing their energies on the constituents' MATERIAL needs (economics, public services, human rights, quality of life). This is why so many people I know who voted for Trump in 2016 (and even some who voted for him in 2020 and 2024) told me at the time that they would have voted for Bernie if it was Trump vs Bernie on the ballot. It had NOTHING to do with policy specifics or philosophy...it's the perception that either candidate was going to do something for them. Hillary and the dems focused unnecessarily on trying to convince voters that their opponents (Trump/the republicans) were evil and dangerous. Trump did that as well Re: Hillary/Biden/the dems. But whether or not someone's political opponent is corrupt/breaking laws/destroying democracy, talking about a court process is **THE OPPOSITE** of talking about a UTOPIAN FUTURE and IMPROVEMENT ON OUR CURRENT QUALITY OF LIFE. It's a proposal for a depressing legal process, not a vision for a period of time anyone would want to live in. I point this out because Trump promised everyone the world in 2016, 2020, and 2024. And I think it's important to notice in 2016 and 2024 people were hungry for any chance at a change in their material conditions. Prosecuting your political opponents may seem like the ""right"" thing to do - either legally or through the lens of history, but it's not a winning formula for building a voting base and governing coalition. Most voters would really rather you just sold them on the idea that you are going to make their lives better. Trump didn't even know what a tariff was 3 months ago and might not even get what one is even today, but the people who voted for him weren't checking whether he knew what a tariff really was - they just believed he was going to try SOMETHING to make their economic standing improve. Ironic, right?  TLDR: telling someone you are going to make them spend the next several years suffering through some court battle or impeachment or investigation is not exactly most people's idea of a good time.",recherche24,2025-04-28T21:23:22,-2

I don’t think there is any scenario where Trump gets removed if republicans have a say in it because they have no real alternative leadership. People try to copy Trump and nobody rallies behind them. People try to oppose Trump and nobody rallies behind them. Vance was picked because nobody really likes him much. Mike Johnson was a boring compromise after everyone’s first five choices fell through. Cheney and Pence got chased out of town for trying to change the party direction. Desantis was a flop with voters. Nobody in the GOP is being groomed for leadership and removing Trump leads to a power vacuum in the party and enraged loyalists. Even if they realize that the emperor has no clothes I can’t see any of them doing anything about it and if any of them try they will be kicked to the curb like the handful of people who made any attempt to push back in the first term.,theLoneliestAardvark,2025-04-28T23:22:02,2

"Problem with that plan is that the 22nd Amendment specifically places limits on the number of times someone can be elected President, not the number of terms:  > No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.  So it doesn't matter whether he served a full 2nd term or not, he has been elected twice, so he cannot be elected again.  Of course the Supreme Court could make up some BS interpretation of the Constitution that twists that, but law as written is clear as crystal, so if they go for that option we're fucked anyway.  Now, the one thing that waiting until after midterms does is make J.D. Vance eligible to run for two full terms in his own right, in addition to finishing out the last two years of Trump's term. That would mean he could serve up to 10 years as President, all perfectly above board.

A failed impeachment does nothing to stop Trump and by failing the Democrats show that they're weak so they lose public support. So it's a double failure.   What I'm saying is that the Democrats, the liberals, and the progresses need to come up with a strategy that has a high likelihood of success. Otherwise all they're doing is empty political gestures which accomplish nothing.   And by demonstrating to the public that you cannot achieve things that you set out to you discourage people from voting for you so it's a really bad strategy to keep picking losing strategies.

Handful of fresh mint leaves, ~1/4 cup  Juice of 3 big lemons, ~3/4 cup  about 3/4 cup of sugar  optional splash of orange blossom water, adjust that to taste, it can be strong.  Whirl all that up in a food processor or blender.  At this point you can either pour the concentrate into a 2 qt pitcher of ice and water and stir the hell out of it OR put 2 qts ice and water in the blender and blend it all into a slushy sort of drink.  I don't do the blender often because my blender is a pain in the ass to clean.  It has a heating element in the bottom of the pitcher you can't get wet.",maddomesticscientist,2025-04-29T08:52:52,1
"What is your evidence for this? Have you gone through the budgets? What, specifically, should he have been spending on in Canada that he wasn’t spending on?",AtticaBlue,2025-04-29T06:32:56,1
i dont know numbers but he spent alot of tjme and resources on none of the main issues were having here ie. housing / crime etc,dezTimez,2025-04-29T06:38:18,1
"You have to know numbers to be able to make the claim you’re making though. But whatever, this is rather typical of this kind of criticism—all feelings and little to no substance. That’s no way to govern, IMO.  The irony is I heard nothing from the Cons about “housing, crime, etc.” Just an endless drumbeat about “woke” (what even is that?) and “axe the tax.”",AtticaBlue,2025-04-29T06:45:31,1

"I have to say I disagree with just about all of that take with the possible exception of the issue of immigration not being matched by an increase in housing. (Although ironically, the “free market” is supposed to naturally take care of all that in terms of demand triggering supply.)  For example, what’s wrong with trying to be on the leading edge of automotive technology where the future appears to be electric cars? I’m not a fan of giving out money to billion-dollar companies like Honda, but we haven’t had a domestic car manufacturing industry in living memory so I’m not sure what the alternative would be. And it’s certainly not at all different from what, say, the Conservatives would do. They love handing out money to billion-dollar companies, whether in the form of tax breaks, funding sports stadiums and so on. This is hardly uniquely Liberal. Only the NDP would be likely to chart a materially different course and Canadians don’t want that, apparently.  (On a related note, are we willing to fund the tax expenditure on improved education to create this “skilled workforce” we need? I certainly see the Cons instantly standing in the way of that because “no taxes.”)  The bit about industrial policy is seemingly contradictory. On one hand the author says the Liberal government gave preference to, for example, large automotive businesses instead of investing in other high-tech sectors like biotech, IT and robotics. But then on the other he says the government “preferenced” small businesses over large ones for R&D funding and tax credits. But wouldn’t the small high- tech businesses be the very home-grown businesses that would be the source of the forward-thinking Canadian industrial strategy the author initially claimed was not being pursued?  He comes off as simply looking for his own handout and bitter that other sectors or industries, and not the ones he favours, received help.  In other places, he’s frustratingly vague. In the “governance” section, for example, he doesn’t give any specifics. He just goes on about “performance politics.” But what does that mean in terms of dollars and cents? No idea.  Similarly, no idea what to make of the defence spending thing. Why is spending tax dollars there a good thing (even though it brings no direct benefit to Canadians) but spending tax dollars elsewhere on social programs like pharmacare and dental care (which Canadians actually need in their daily lives) a bad thing? Ironically, that’s what counts to me as “performance politics.”  I do agree the productivity issue is a puzzle, but I think it’s a bit more complicated than the author makes it out to be though it’s hinted at in one of the references he gives (it has to do with the global shift of manufacturing away from the developed world to other places).  I do get a kick out of the crocodile tears about stagnant worker wages though. Because we all know businesses love nothing more than to pay their employees more money, lol.",AtticaBlue,2025-04-29T08:40:00,1
