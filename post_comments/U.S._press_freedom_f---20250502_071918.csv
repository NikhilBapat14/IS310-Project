"What’s most troubling to me is that the restriction of freedom is largely self-imposed. I’ve never seen the press retreat from its role the way it has since January 20th. And yet, during Biden’s term, they never gave him a moment of peace—constantly scrutinizing and challenging him at every turn.",mgwccnv,2025-05-02T07:52:42,176
Free speech in general. I don't feel comfortable expressing myself on IG or TT because the administration is searching people's phones,Altruistic_Mix_290,2025-05-02T08:08:39,40
"It’s funny because journalists and news media have always treated Republicans with kid gloves, and sanewashed Trumps psychotic idiocy at every opportunity.   It really seems like they were moronic enough to believe that being so obsequious to the fascists would earn them special treatment once the regime came to power. The jokes on them, if you’re not willing to give Trump the full dear leader treatment then you’re his enemy.",bestforward121,2025-05-02T08:43:36,17

"[rapport press freedom index](https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/rsf-moves-downgrades-global-press-freedom-index-to-all-time-loe/)  It is a bad sign that there are so little countries that get the rating ""good""(only 7)",nijmeegse79,2025-05-02T07:45:49,9

Interesting that this trend line precisely matches not only the number of actual journalists remaining but the number of actual news outlets left in America.,Supra_Genius,2025-05-02T08:22:03,4
"And they have nobody to blame but themselves.  They sanewashed the orange asshole at every opportunity instead of challenging him or his cronies in any meaningful way, all in the name of ratings and network traffic.  They helped make the monster that is this current regime.",TheResolutePrime,2025-05-02T10:26:31,3
"A mostly self-imposed restriction, an act of self-sabotage to capitulate to the world's most idiotic dictator. Imploding journalistic integrity hoping to catch the scraps that dribble from the Fascist Orange's slack-jawed mouth.",Mind_Killer,2025-05-02T10:30:06,3
Makes sense logically.       Laws are ignored in the US so news isn't really going to help or hurt us.         Americans are failing America willingly. The MAGA movement is sending us back to the 1700s.,faith_apnea,2025-05-02T11:08:52,3

"This falls squarely on the shoulders of Harris.  Press freedom would have been in great shape she been elected.  All she had to do was excite us more, and be less milquetoast.  She was infinitely better than Trump, on every level. But she failed to earn our vote.  I hope she learned her lesson.",insuproble,2025-05-02T11:59:43,1

"That AMA from the (I think the AP?) newsroom was absolutely insane to read.  Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/s/9DxY5q5hSi  Nothing but spineless twats grandstanding their *extremely arduous* efforts to continuously cover one of Trumps 400 red herrings instead of actually ever confronting him, or even bothering to ask a single meaningful question that didn't already have a guaranteed non-answer.  Their only response to the hundreds of people who asked some version of ""what are you guys doing to fix this messed up situation?"" was that they were clearly trying their best and that it'd be great if you could pitch in too!   Seems like the kids from 20 years ago that just wanted to be journalists for the street cred spent way too much time partying and dropping acid in school, and are nowhere near as self-aware or confrontational as the world needed them to be.  I respect modern journalists even less than I do the republican politicians themselves.",tomerz99,2025-05-02T09:37:39,47

"They're actually going one step further and requiring people to submit their social media accounts along with their VISA applications.  Honestly this could accidentally be a good thing for society, when people realize that these online communities actually have ramifications.  I know the irony of stating this on Reddit, but at the same time I'm never going to the United States under this regime anyways, so I am at least aware of the possible consequences of my actions.  Many people aren't and this is giving them a massive wakeup call.",Serapth,2025-05-02T08:18:00,18

The decline of press freedom has nothing to do with the fact that the press isn't endorsing your Alex Jones style anti-reality conspiracy theories. As much as you'd like to make those claims.,Despair-Envy,2025-05-02T11:30:16,5
It's the rank. RSF provides a score and then ranks countries based on that score relative to each other. The US had the 46th best score roughly a decade ago and now it's 57th.,Naurgul,2025-05-02T15:04:34,1

"As a student journalist (and a pharmacy student who has never taken a journalism or mass comm class), these sorts of people are unfortunately quite common in the media world. The worst part is, a fair few of them have seemingly no regard for the truth. I've fired people for ethical violations, and they just don't get it. They just want to be Hunter S.
