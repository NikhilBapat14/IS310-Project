"> ""From the left""  I find it awful too",No-Carrot-5213,2025-05-04T09:22:03,283
I wish he could focus less on trolling and “just a joke” nonsense and try to rebuild some divisions in this country. He knows how to fan those flames and shows no desire to let them die out. Keeping up a constant barrage of nonsense. Flood the zone with shit right,MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T07:58:40,455
"Well, I'm not from ""the Left,"" just a Catholic who expects more than mockery from the president of the United States.  Is it so much to ask that the leader of the free world *not* act like a childish trolling buffoon?  Seriously. Stop telling people what they should and shouldn't be offended by.",AlicesFlamingo,2025-05-04T09:49:00,437
"All one has to ask is what was the motive behind posting said AI slop? All things considered, this seems like yet another example of Trump being too egotistical to understand that maybe this was done in bad taste.",Stea1thsniper32,2025-05-04T10:09:39,89
"I am the furthest thing from a leftist and I thought it was distasteful and pointless. End of the day, why is he intentionally trying to upset people? Why is our president ""trolling""? This is not how our statesmen should behave. I'm sorry but I expect better of someone holding the highest office in the world, I expect some basic decorum, especially during a time of mourning.  If Trump continues to focus on building the economy and common sense policies people will continue to appreciate him. Doing things just to be disrespectful accomplishes nothing, it's creating controversey just for the sake of it but there's no end goal... he obviously offended people, and for what?",GannyHams,2025-05-04T08:14:28,472

Man this sub is now all liberals huh ,planned_fun,2025-05-04T09:26:15,-2
Remember when the press told everyone to lighten up on artist expression when “Piss Christ” and “Elephant Dung Mary” were portrayed?  Now they’re like the zealot Spanish Inquisition against Trump.    Lol!  Such hypocrisy!,Alas_Babylonz,2025-05-04T08:50:58,-11
All those democrat catholics.. 🤣,Grouchy_Map7133,2025-05-04T08:58:51,-5
I'm a practicing Roman Catholic and this is hysterical.   I love the trolling.  How many people who are offended actually went to Mass today or are pro choice?  Such hypocrites.,BoltsFan126,2025-05-04T09:21:32,-7
No one with a modicum of sense is upset over this.,No_Bowler_3286,2025-05-04T09:22:45,-6
"Yeah, a bunch of atheists and non-christians telling Catholics what they can make jokes about is peak leftardation.   Everyone knows it was just a joke. It's not sacrilegious to make jokes. The left just hasn't seen real humor in decades. They only exist to be offended.",MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-04T07:48:05,-23
Outrage from the left and the whiners in this sub.  More posts bitching about this topic than celebrating any of his many wins.,IrishWolfHounder,2025-05-04T08:53:42,-15
Well. He's doing a pretty good job at pissing off everyone. I will take it for a functioning country.,Outrageous_Skirt9963,2025-05-04T12:56:59,-4
"Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!",bulletorb,2025-05-04T10:53:58,-7
"I agree. Trump gets in his own way and creates self-forced errors. This was unnecessary and counterproductive, not “Presidential” in my opinion.   This and nonsense like Canada 51st State that is impossible to happen just make him more divisive and detracts from his policies that should be the only focus.   Part of me believes he is a lame duck and this is his last term and he doesn’t care anymore what people think. He just wants to get attention and feed his ego. From a political perspective, it makes no sense.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-05-04T08:13:05,239
Strongly agreed.,murmanator,2025-05-04T08:17:26,53
Focus less time....Do you think he's really making all these images himself?,BryanFnR,2025-05-04T17:44:50,5
"Nah. The way the Left treated Romney taught me that it doesn’t matter what you say or advocate for, they will twist it to sound bad.",8K12,2025-05-04T09:39:30,-15
"Oh yes, because those divisions were certainly healing the last 4 years...   The op title should mention conservatives, too.  ETA: Downvote away, but its true. If people wanted to heal the division, they could make the concious choice to do so. You're appealing to an extreme minority, whereas the majority are able to chuckle at this, alongside the Biden Pope memes, and go about their day.",Panzershrekt,2025-05-04T09:59:36,-18
It's okay to make jokes. Stop telling people what they should and shouldn't be offended by.   Love the brigade pretending they care about religion now though.,Hrendo,2025-05-04T18:36:03,-15
"In the past few decades the Troll In Chief has been the most “for America and Americans” POTUS this country has even so much has considered.     Yeah it’d be nice if he’d keep the temperature a few degrees lower, but at the end of the day I’m just going to suck it up and and stay happy as a pig in mud we have a President who is here for us, not to make tens of millions of dollars in book deals and speaking engagements.",cliffotn,2025-05-04T11:54:30,-81

The Pope is just a guy. Often throughout history the position was very corrupt. Today it's just a popularity contest. This wasn't like him making an AI image of himself as Jesus.,Hectoriu,2025-05-04T08:29:11,-128
It's funny how we tell people to lighten up........  Downvoting hypocrites. Get bent,indefiniteretrieval,2025-05-04T08:16:34,-95
"He wasn’t trying to upset people with that post. He thought it was funny. A lot of people thought it was funny. The pope is just a man. And historically, the pope has been a very corrupt man. A lot of you don’t seem to understand that.",IamYourBestFriendAMA,2025-05-04T08:38:41,-39

"But if he was an NPC robotic nobody, then he wouldn't get elected or you'd at least complain about his empty character.  Love how you're all surprised Trump is a character, as if born yesterday. He's humiliating the woke Hall Monitors, like you.",Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T09:12:13,-87
"Does anyone think Trump is the one making these ?  No.  Edit: deleted the rest of my comment because I’m not trying to debate. I realize my logic is my own. Instead of telling me why I am wrong , show me how I’m wrong. Show me examples of Trump not acting like … well this.  But instead I’m just getting a bunch of DMs about how I’m a fellow conservative. Cheers.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T18:22:22,9
That is a great point. It seems easier to get elected based on who your “enemy” is and less on policy.,MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T09:41:27,21

So you don't care if you offend Catholics.,AlicesFlamingo,2025-05-04T09:51:18,59
"I reject the idea that nobody should be offended at anything. Some things are offensive, some things may be personall offensive based on your beliefs... If someone insults my mother, I'm going to be offended. If somebody makes a mockery of my faith, I'm going to be offended.  I wouldn't treat people that way. Why should we just be okay with the president doing it? Why is all of his behavior that seems only to exist to intentionally offend people not called out? If my son did this I'd tell him to be ashamed of himself.",GannyHams,2025-05-04T08:21:57,126
Glad we're weeding out all the leftists. This guy is a leftist. Just look at his posts.,Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T09:04:16,-21

Humiliating Woke Hall Monitors like me?  I always thought it was Leftists who name call because they have nothing intelligent to say.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-05-04T09:35:29,75
"I have given up caring about what imagery Trump puts out there and I am all in on trolling now because it shows how ridiculous the Left has become. Trump could say “I am a fish today! Blub blub!” And they would foam at the mouths over it. If they could sit back and just see what they look like whenever he sends a joke, there would be more sanity. But the more they over-react, the more he trolls them and I am fine with it.",8K12,2025-05-04T10:53:05,-10
"No, you didn't, which is why I'm pointing it out. So it's on Trump to heal division, despite being given a mandate to do exactly what he's doing, and which the other half of the country doesn't like regardless of who is in the White House. And you think this harmless little picture is undoing whatever unity he managed to gain in 100 days? Do tell.",Panzershrekt,2025-05-04T14:48:27,-2
Why is it offensive to Catholics?,Hectoriu,2025-05-04T10:24:28,-38
Because it's funny🤷🏻‍♂️   The pope isn't Mohammed. And Christians aren't muslims,indefiniteretrieval,2025-05-04T08:23:18,-100

Why would you think that? You're the one being offended by jokes.,Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T10:04:21,-49
"I think showing respect to people that dont respect you is a certain type of virtue. Someone’s going to have to give if this shithole is going to right course.  I’m terrible at it.  I just wish the Trump cared about the other half of the country enough to lead by example. But his example is exactly what I would tell my kids not to be, and that’s why I’ll be glad when Vance rolls through in a few years (hopefully)",MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T14:36:47,7
"I’m not sure what you are talking about or who you think you are responding to.  The idea of an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind isn’t incorrect. I was simply stating he’s the president and I wish he would act like it. I support him, but I don’t have to agree with him, and he is not above criticism.  So find someone to argue with , it’s not me buddy.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T16:21:06,5
It's a position appointed by man and there is no issue with making a joke about it. People are treating the pope like some devine saint or Jesus.,Hectoriu,2025-05-04T08:31:41,-47

Mohammed was at least a prophet with some divine connection at least according to Islam. Treating the pope like anything other than a man is actually a sin in itself,Hectoriu,2025-05-04T08:35:30,-14

You're exactly right but also Trump didn't insult the Pope. If he had made an image of the Pope in a clown hat then sure it would have been disrespectful.,Hectoriu,2025-05-04T08:39:13,0
