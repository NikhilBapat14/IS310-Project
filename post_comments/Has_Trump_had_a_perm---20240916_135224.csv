"Trump has had a large role in shifting the dynamic of election campaigns and politics in general but I believe with the rise of technology, easy access to information, and the younger generations becoming a large majority participating in politics a candidate/politician like Donald trump are going to become the norm. Clicks and clout is what seems to get the attention now a days. Tan and goofy blonde hair loud New Yorker billionaire definitely gets attention. With a lot of people staying informed through short videos and social media posts I’m afraid Donald is just the beginning. Buckle up it’s gonna be a bumpy ride!",pattyboy123456,2024-09-27T00:49:43,1
"In my opinion mr. vance is a more slick talking version of trump. I do think he has made a permanent mark, in a negative manner that will be taught in schools of higher education. It was an attempt to stay in the oval office illegally, call it what you will but what it wasn't is a peaceful transfer of power.",braindeaths,2024-10-22T14:40:27,1
