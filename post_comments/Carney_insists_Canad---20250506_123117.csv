Carney sounded like a leader and got his point across in a diplomatic way.  Trump looked like he was sitting on a toilet and grunting out words.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-05-06T12:35:36,44

"For those dissing Carney for not jerseys-ing Trump:  Let’s do a reality check:  this is the White House.  It would be national suicide to jersey Trump in the White House.   Secondly, Trump is a blowhard and a braggart.  He will always get the last word, doubly so in his “house”.  So, let’s put this perspective and acknowledge that Carney was never going to go into the White House and jersey Trump, let alone be allowed to say much substantive nor concrete, apart from the whole “51st state” drivel that Carney clearly and without hyperbole, said “never” in response to Trump’s “never say never” babble.  Carney came across as poised, confident, relaxed, and was able to articulate his points precisely and effectively.  Look at the March and especially April economic data coming out of Industry Canada (just released today).  Canadian exports are already pivoting (albeit small) offshore.  The real discussions will be at the functional level, behind closed doors, fully orchestrated by Carney, Joly, and a bunch of very smart people that won a losing hand for CUSME 1.0.  Before we start screeching at the sky about Carney not being “tough enough”, let’s let the dude that ran two central banks, was a senior advisor to the WTO, a key executive for a major international commercial property and investment company, as well as being a grad of both Harvard and Oxford, do his thing.   We can review in 3 & 6 months.  Before then, let the dude do his dekes.",Spanky3703,2025-05-06T12:41:19,30

"""I look forward to meeting the new Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney. I very much want to work with him, but cannot understand one simple TRUTH — Why is America subsidizing Canada by $200 Billion Dollars a year, in addition to giving them FREE Military Protection, and many other things? We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship, which hopefully we will always maintain.

yet a true leader who ran their campaign on resisting trump would NOT visit the white house . they would close the border and ban all trade with the US and restrict/ban travel to and from the US until Trump leaves office. this is a MASSIVE sign of weakness and shows that all of the election was just posturing. Canada abuses their NATO commitments and Trump rightly pointed that out. Trump didn't go to Ottawa. Carney came to DC>,broncofl,2025-05-07T13:08:12,1

"Those are really good points regarding Trump.  I never really took the time to put it all into one perspective but I think that you nailed it.   None of my original comments are trying to whitewash the fact that this is going to be a painful and challenging period for Canada as we pivot away from the US and de-link our respective economies.  But I get the sense that Carney understands what he needs to do, how he needs to behave in relation to Trump, and where he needs to get Canada to.  I really do feel sad for the loss of the relationship between our two countries.  I was in the Canadian Army for over 39 years and deployed many times alongside American military personnel in really bad places; I always found them to be honourable, professional, great allies, and good people.  That relationship is irretrievably gone and what will replace it, if anything does in any substantive way, will be lesser.  There will be no real warmth nor trust going forward, at least from the perspective of Canada.  That is truly unfortunate.
