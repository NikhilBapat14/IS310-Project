"So first, let's get how the Electoral College works.  Its easiest to think of the EC as 50+ mini-elections to determine who the state is going to vote for President and Vice President.  Each state determines how it allocates its votes - most are winner-take-all, but Nebraska and Maine allocated it by Congressional District and then winner-take-all state-wide.  So at the end of election day, we see how each state's votes turned out.  And, state by state, we count how many each candidate gets.  Texas went for Trump and its winner-take-all, so Trump gets the votes for Texas.  California went for Harris and its winner-take-all, so Harris gets the votes for California.  And so on.  First one to get a majority of the votes (270) wins.  (Should note that in today's election, there is a path for a 269-269 tie, but I'll come back to that.)  Each state is awarded a number of votes equal to its number of Senators (always 2) and the number of House Representatives it is allocated per the census based on relative population.  Using Texas and California again, Texas has 38 Representatives and 2 Senators, so they have a total of 40 votes.  California, on the other hand, has 52 representatives and 2 Senators, so they have 54 votes.  (As of writing, this hasn't technically happened but if either of those states turn the opposite, there is a landslide election anyway.)  The reason this structure exists goes all the way back to when the US Constitution was drafted.  Smaller states feared the more populous states would take over, so they wanted equal voting for all states (this is how it was under the Articles of Confederation) and is called the [New Jersey Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Plan).  The larger states didn't want a tiny state to have more say than them, so they wanted it based on population - the [Virginia Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Plan).  (I'm simplifying here somewhat.)  A compromise was reached - called the [Connecticut Compromise or Great Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Compromise) - in which each state would have the same representation in Congress in the Senate and each state have relative power equal to population* in the House.  This was then taken into account when developing how the President and Vice President was to be elected.  All this culminates into what we all see in the Electoral College maps.  We generally know how many states are going to vote (based on history, polling, etc) so we can quickly and (usually) safely mark them in their respective columns until we get into those which are too close to call - ""the swing states"" - this cycle it is a collection of seven states.  Over time these states will move in and out of the ""swing state"" status.  Back in 2000 Ohio and Florida were swing states.  One of the criticisms of the Electoral College is people complain that a few states determine who wins the Presidency.  Its an oversimplification for the reason I mentioned earlier - if the solid red/blue states don't actually turn out that way, the swing states may not even matter.  For example, if Texas does go Blue, the only way Trump can win is to take *every* swing state.  Which given there are national factors that play into all those individual races, is not very likely.  And as population shifts and grows, the electoral votes shift around and new patterns emerge, leading to new swing states and the like.  Now, back to that ""each state has relative power equal to population"" note - this isn't technically true since in 1929 Congress passed the [Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929) which capped the House at 435 seats.  But since a state *has* to have at least one representative, this means Wyoming technically has a slightly more ""powerful"" vote in the Electoral College than California, as is usually mentioned.  If we repealled that and went with a House that had the same number of people represented by each Representative, the [Wyoming Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule), the House would expand out to 574 representatives and it would be resolved.  But that would also create more Electoral Votes too... which would make that next Presidential election quite interesting.  Hope this helps!",AuditorTux,2024-11-05T13:28:13,3
"Honestly, it would depend on what you specifically want to learn. But the government and Congress publish information about how our government works, from basic information to more detailed processes and procedures. But I would start by just googling what you want to know, and looking for government or academic sources to gain knowledge.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-04T10:01:55,2
"Each states electoral vote is determined on how many reps and senators they have.  Each state at a minimum has 2 senators 1 rep so a minimum of 3 EV's.    Every state has 2 senators  Every state's rep amount varies on population  Senator + reps = electoral vote (EV) amount so it's a mix of population and not population based to give small states a little boost in their voice in the masses which is the thinking behind it, agree or not it's up to you but it's the constitutional implementation",Intelligent-Coconut8,2024-11-06T00:36:59,1
Dude its pretty simple. The united states is not a single country.  It's a confederation of 50 seperate countries. Each STATE (notice how it's not province or region.  But state as in a nation-state) counts votes independently then sends representatives to vote for them. It's designed this way to prevent states with huge populations from overwhelming small states.  Although it would have mattered trump won the popular vote too,[deleted],2024-11-06T08:42:45,1

">But since a state has to have at least one representative, this means Wyoming technically has a slightly more ""powerful"" vote in the Electoral College than California, as is usually mentioned  It's actually more than slight. Calculating from data on the Wyoming Rule Wikipedia page, voters in Wyoming have about 3 times the voting power of California voters, assuming turnout proportional to population. For a midsize state, Wisconsin, it's about 20% more than CA.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-07T12:42:44,1

Most of that is actually from the Senate seats and the implication there (smaller population on the same 2 seats).  Although that itself would also be reduced if they expanded the House.,AuditorTux,2024-11-07T12:50:49,1
"Sure, that's why I would like to eliminate the 2 ""bonus"" Electoral College votes. More complicated change than the number of House seats though.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-07T13:19:10,1
"Its darn near impossible to change that - it'd take a Constitutional Amendment, which just proposing is too much of a hurdle for anything to clear, let alone the ratification.  I personally think the Wyoming Rule doesn't go far enough - I'd love to have a thousand-plus House reps or more and keep most of them in their home districts and spend time with their constituents.  And that basically waters down those 2 electoral votes from the Senate seat to basically a rounding error.",AuditorTux,2024-11-07T13:26:46,1
"True, because small state voters also have a vast advantage in the ratification process.   Your idea is an excellent solution. If I remember correctly, politicians from the original progressive era advocated for the idea of larger representative bodies, at least for local governments. Perhaps we could list enlist the support of the originalists by asking for the same number of population per representative as there was in the founders' day. :)",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-07T13:46:19,1
Im unclear why the discussion assumes the senate has equal power to the house. The senate votes separately so there is no deluting that power. The approve all appointees incl SCOTUS and they stall active bills from the house every year. The latter happens as designed the 'saucer of the tea cup' that slows change. But also because the senate is busy with appointments and it's leaders prioritize controversial agenda items for debate (eg healthcare) instead of things that are bipartisan (eg child welfare).   So I disagree with the arguement that more house seats would change any of that.,rosecarter990,2024-11-08T06:31:36,1
">Perhaps we could list enlist the support of the originalists by asking for the same number of population per representative as there was in the founders' day. :)  According to the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_apportionment), in 1793 it was 34k per rep - it would generate somewhere around 9.7+k reps.  Man, talk about opportunities for factions within the main two parties.  And probably good chances for third parties/regional factions.",AuditorTux,2024-11-07T14:05:41,2
"I think they were talking about the population per electoral vote metric that people came up with would mostly even out if you added a bunch of house seats.    For example:  * Wyoming - 584k divided by 3 EV = 1 EV per 194k * California - 39M divided by 54 = 1 EV per 722k  But if we go with 34k population per rep plus those two for the Senate, it becomes:  * Wyoming - 584k divided by 19 EV (17 reps, 2 Senators) = 1 EV per 30,736 * California - 39M divided by 1149 EV (1147 reps, 2 Senators) = 1 EV per 33,942   That's a difference of roughly 10% in ""voting power"" after as opposed to multiple turns before.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-08T09:58:52,1
"Might reduce the influence of big donors, too. Even a billionaire would be spread thin supporting 9.7K campaigns - or in some cases double that.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-07T14:37:03,1
