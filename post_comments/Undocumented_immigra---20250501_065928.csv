This has been known for a long time. The problem is that conservatives don’t care about facts; they only care about what they are told to believe.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-01T07:01:07,22
"This is why anyone who says ""they don't pay taxes"" is so full of shit their eyes must be brown. And aside from this they pay sales tax, gas tax, etc. Just such an ignorant stance to take.",half_dozen_cats,2025-05-01T07:17:23,9
Terrible headline because only citizens can collect social security. Undocumented and migrant workers pay in and never collect would be more accurate.,reddread69,2025-05-01T07:03:56,19
"Pay in, get nothing, still blamed. That’s the real injustice.",Euphoric-Bed7379,2025-05-01T07:12:26,6
"So let me get this straight. Undocumented immigrants commit the fewest crimes, they contribute positively to America's tax base, and they do the jobs most Americans are unwilling to do.   So basically if Trump and MAGA succeed in getting rid of these people, America will become an even bigger shithole than Trump's America already is. Got it.",biscuitarse,2025-05-01T07:53:37,5
"Republicans don’t care about hardworking, tax-paying brown and black people. They will always lie and blame.",PlsServeTheServants,2025-05-01T07:40:00,3

"Trump and minions aren't worried about the loss of immigrants' contributions to Social Security. The revenues saved by either starving out oldsters and poor folks (i.e., via cuts to Meals on Wheels, Food Stamps, etc.), by tossing the unhealthy off of ""the dole"" (e.g., those with measles, HIV, disability, etc.), and by eliminating those starving peasants around the world from our price list, will more than make up those losses. There will still be more than enough money to make sure the 1 Percenters get their shares.  Don't you worry!",phosdick,2025-05-01T08:04:49,1
"Duh… my husband paid into social security and taxes for years, all he got back was a free deportation flight!",enlamadre666,2025-05-01T13:59:30,1

That those ineligible for benefits don't receive them is not news.,drjjoyner,2025-05-01T07:08:33,0
The same can be said for US citizens,motohaas,2025-05-01T09:35:05,-1
That’s crazy because any person who legally visits another country will pay taxes for goods. Wild right? So this remark about an illegal doing the same thing is just stupid. ,MagicHarmony,2025-05-01T07:38:21,1
How so?,crusty_sloth,2025-05-01T09:52:36,1
It's because right-wingers keep making this claim that they don't pay any taxes. It's another lie they tell.,HuttStuff_Here,2025-05-01T07:56:36,6
Just wait.,ChaoticSenior,2025-05-01T10:26:34,1

"I don’t “know” that this administration will mess with social security, but based on the entirety of their actions so far I do believe it’s highly likely. Their track record very much favors the wealthy. I say this as a recipient of social security.",ChaoticSenior,2025-05-01T11:59:05,1
