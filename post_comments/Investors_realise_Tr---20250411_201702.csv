"Markets crave stability like plants crave Brawndo, and Trump has *promised* he'll continue to be a destabilizing agent. The fact that they can't even lie and say they're content with the ""updated"" tariffs and continuously remind people it's only a ""pause"" will continue to have knock-on effects for months.  He closed the zippo, but he's still holding the Molotov and the lighter, and swearing he'll fuckin do it if he doesn't get his way. Sure, everyone breathed a momentary sigh of relief when he didn't light it this time, but nobody is mistaking this for the ""all clear"".   It's too risky for any industry to try and predict what will happen next - the only really safe play is to try to decouple your supply chain from the US as much as possible.",Dustin_Echoes_UNSC,2025-04-12T00:50:35,12
