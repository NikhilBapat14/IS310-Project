Trump is trying to create more scandal to distract from his fiscal policy failure.,transcriptoin_error,2025-04-23T19:12:48,86
Good.  We sincerely thank his effort to unify the country against him.,thieh,2025-04-23T19:13:49,64
I'm agnostic but I do hope Trump rots in hell. The idea that he will rest peacefully after all his evil does not sit well.,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-23T19:14:08,26
The Liberal party thanks Trump for his support.  Congratulations to Mark Carney for remaining as prime minister.,I405CA,2025-04-23T19:24:44,22
"The level of disrespect for our sovereignty will be hard to forget. We try to don't but USA products, we stopped to travel in USA.  We don't need to be bully by your country.

"Well, that just clinched a Liberal majority government on April 28th, lol. Nice to see Trump occasionally do a good deed, even though that wasn't the intention he had in mind. That somehow makes it nicer, though.",biscuitarse,2025-04-23T19:27:26,17

"I was wondering when this orange shit gibbon would start up again with the whole ""Canada is the 51st State."" garbage.  Obviously, someone told Trump that this wasn't playing well in Canada, and that maybe he should ease up, at least until after our election.  But, after trying to bully the entire world and getting his ass handed to him by China, it is no surprise that Trump is now attempting to make himself feel powerful by going back to beating up on his perceived weaker neighbors, Canada and Greenland.",KimmyT1436,2025-04-23T19:28:49,10
