"While I agree that kids should have their social media access moderated (ideally by their parents), I think a blanket ban is kinda silly. My own experience is that some people are just hard-wired to respond poorly to the gamification of social approval regardless of age, so kicking it back to 18 is likely just going to delay the issues a bit. Imo kids need to be monitored and directly taught to interact with it properly, much like firearms. I've always been inclined to avoid it, but it's like a drug for others and they WILL eventually use it.     There's also the question of what counts as social media. Do Steam and Discord count?

"H.B. No. 186  A BILL TO BE ENTITLED   AN ACT   relating to prohibiting use of social media platforms by children. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:SECTION 1. Chapter 120, Business & Commerce Code, is amended by adding Subchapter C-1 to read as follows:  SUBCHAPTER C-1. USER AGE LIMITATION  Sec. 120.111. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter:   (1) ""Account holder"" means a resident of this state who opens an account or creates a profile or is identified by the social media platform by a unique identifier while using or accessing a social media platform.   (2) ""Child"" means an individual who is younger than 18 years of age.  Sec. 120.112. USE BY CHILDREN PROHIBITED. To the extent permitted by federal law, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, a child may not use a social media platform.  Sec. 120.113. ACCOUNT AND VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.   (a) A social media platform shall:   (1) prohibit a child from entering into a contract with the social media platform to become an account holder; and   (2) verify that a person seeking to become an account holder is 18 years of age or older before accepting the person as an account holder.   (b) A social media platform must use a commercially reasonable method that relies on public or private transactional data to verify the age of an individual as required under Subsection (a).   (c) Personal information obtained under Subsection (b) may only be used for age verification purposes and may not be retained, used, transmitted, or otherwise conveyed. The social media company must delete personal information immediately upon completion of the age verification process.  Sec. 120.114. REQUIRED REMOVAL OF ACCOUNT.   (a) Not later than the 10th day after receiving a request from a parent or guardian verified by a social media company, the company shall delete the account of the parent's or guardian's child and cease further use or maintenance in retrievable form or future online collection of personal information collected from the child's account.   (b) A social media company must provide a reasonable, accessible, and verifiable means by which a parent or guardian may make a request.  Sec. 120.115. ENFORCEMENT.   (a) A social media company violates this subchapter if the company knowingly:   (1) fails to verify a person's age before accepting the person as an account holder;   (2) allows a child to use its platform;   (3) misuses personal information in violation of Section 120.113(c); or   (4) fails to remove an account as required by Section 120.114.   (b) A violation of this subchapter by a social media platform is considered a deceptive trade practice and subject to action by the consumer protection division of the attorney general's office.  SECTION 2. Subchapter C-1, Chapter 120, Business & Commerce Code, as added by this Act, applies only to access to a social media platform on or after January 1, 2026.  SECTION 3. This Act takes effect September 1, 2025.",According-Activity87,2025-05-02T14:04:19,3

"Look we can disagree but I've worked in social media and public policy for 25 years.    We also have decentralization coming along, and block chain based profiles, both which force complete anonymity and zero locus of control, which means not even China or, hell, North Korea could prevent their citizens from being in it.    The Danish company doesn't have to comply, they set up offices in Nigeria, and host all of whatever people don't like, from there, and they do it on the block chain, decentralized, so it can't be traced and can't be taken down.   Porn hub is choosing to comply because it is exposing that what exists in its place, is much more extreme and unstoppable.  For example, Texas just passed a bill saying you must put a disclaimer on anything generated by AI that misleading represents a politician. Violation of the First Amendment? Yep, huge one. Doesn't matter, because what it caused and will caused, out of ignorance of how the internet works, is a flurry of more, far more, that these people seek to stop.  They can't enforce their law beyond Texas, certainly not in other countries, so it's not only impotent, it will it flood the internet with precisely what they don't want.

People leave because it no longer does what they want, and they all shifted to X, Twitter, more TikTok.    Governments can keep playing whack a mole but the long game is that law can stop anything online.  Anything.  You can't enforce copyright, you can't protect IP, you can't enforce privacy or prevent hacking.

""It's also not a good case since the appellant admitted the material was harmful to minors.""  What's important is the level of scrutiny applied.  There are three levels of scrutiny applied to state action in judging it's constitutional validity. Strict, intermediate, and rational basis. In that case, the lowest was applied: rational basis.  In Ginsberg, the state law just had to have a rationally related basis to a legitimate government end. The legitimate end in this case was the safeguarding of children from harm. Similarly, in the case of the Texas Bill, it just has to have a rational relation to safeguarding children from harm.

"Sorry, I had to divide up my response for Reddit to accept it.  ""Tinker v.

Indeed, I had thought the Court decided otherwise just last Term in *Ginsberg v. New York*, [390 U. S. 629](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/390/629/).  So where did the case law take us?  ""The First Amendment guarantees wide freedom in matters of adult public discourse. A sharply divided Court upheld the right to express an antidraft viewpoint in a public place, albeit in terms highly offensive to most citizens. *See Cohen v. California,* [403 U. S. 15](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/403/15/) (1971). It does not follow, however, that, simply because the use of an offensive form of expression may not be prohibited to adults making what the speaker considers a political point, the same latitude must be permitted to children in a public school.

It's more of a manner of pointing out the awful cases that came out at that time. It didn't make constitutional rights stronger, it made strict scrutiny weaker.
