Has anyone else noticed that he has been trying to throw money at people alot lately? With the payments for workers who quit in the government. Wanting to give the citizens of Greenland money to push for joining the United States. Paying the Jan 6 insurrectionists. Now for self deporting.  He is trying hard to buy people off with tax payer money.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-05T11:32:35,4

"So much of what trump does parallels The Joker in The Dark Knight.  The belief that everyone is hollow and selfish at their core, that anybody can be corrupted or bought.  That nobody's actually a good person and anyone who is is just pretending so they can get something.  Just give somebody something they want and theyll do anything for you, betray anyone for you, no matter how awful.    It runs through every one of trump's actions.  This, The law firm and university crackdowns, the federal worker buy outs, everything.  And so far hes being proven right more than wrong.  Most of these institutions aside from the federal workers have put morals and ethics aside in favor of appeasement and personal interest.  narcissists like trump believe everyone is as cruel and selfish as they are, and in the US that belief isnt that far off base.  I mean after all, only an incredibly sick and narcisstic society would even let trump on the ballot, nevermind vote for him.    trump is destroying a lot, but hes also revealing a lot.",StashedandPainless,2025-05-05T11:48:19,4

I wish they would to offer to buy progressive American citizens out of the country. Someone with a Twitter account should float the idea to Musk. I'm a natural-born citizen going back seven generations and I would leave in a hot second if they gave me a $70k stipend to do so.,GeneralChemistry1467,2025-05-06T09:07:06,1
