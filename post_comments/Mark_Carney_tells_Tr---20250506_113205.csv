"For sure.  Much like with Carney's reaction, I think we can all share in how disrespectful his BS is. He is completely out to lunch and mentally ill with regards to the obvious malignant narcissism that clouds his judgement and behaviour.       IMO, I think Carney did well. He got out what needed to be up until the end when Trump ended the question period. It will be interesting to hear what happens next and whether the discussion was at all meaningful. It's nice to know that someone who is extremely knowledgeable in trade and economics is there in discussions. Personally, I just don't think we will see a lot of change - I hope I can be proven wrong though.",Narrow_Example_3370,2025-05-06T12:19:47,4

I immediately understood what he meant.  It was a passive aggressive response... and a good one too.,Very-Original,2025-05-06T12:41:47,20
"I love how he worded it, not only making it clear we aren’t for sale and talking down to him with a childlike analogy to real estate - but also making it clear that the people own Canada and he’s simply our representative, as opposed to there in america where trump owns the country and the people are irrelevant",f0rmality,2025-05-06T14:13:55,14
He was wording it in a way to make Trump understand.  The Canadian citizens voted for Carney and the Liberals stance that Canada would never be teh 51st US State.     Trump only understands things in terms of real estate terms and owning buildings.   Canada is a building that is not for sale.,Sinochick,2025-05-06T13:55:40,14
