From wikipedia:  In the United States in the early 1970s, there was an increasing number of [New Religious Movements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Religious_Movement). [Ted Patrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Patrick), the ""father of deprogramming"", formed an organization he called ""The Citizens' Freedom Foundation"" and began offering 'deprogramming' services to people who wanted to break a family member's connection to an NRM. Patrick's methods involved abduction, physical restraint, detention over days or weeks while maintaining a constant presence with the victim, food and sleep deprivation, prolonged verbal and emotional abuse, and desecration of the symbols of the victim's faith.[^(\[9\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprogramming#cite_note-holywars-9)[^(\[10\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprogramming#cite_note-10)  I'm not suggesting this, though it would feel like proper retribution.",Weakera,2025-04-06T06:30:44,1
"I honestly think RCV would make an immediate change. Maybe many people would have difficulty not voting for a Republican or democrat candidate at first. But if you think about rcv is designed so you never get an extremist on either side. It is specifically made so that at least 50% of the population semi-wants a candidate. You would probably never get a Trump or anybody like him in office.  I am going, to be honest: I don't think most Americans actually like either party and if you force in RCV, you would see a complete shift away from extremism and honestly away from Maga. The Republican party would probably distance itself away from Trump as he simply would not win any RCV elections just because of how hated he is on the left. I honestly think that if an Rcv election were to happen today, trump would get on the bottom of every democrats list and, if not very close to the bottom. The person who gets into office is the person who is the middle of the pack in that society. This is a good fricking thing if you ask me because this country is too fricking divided, and honestly, I just want somebody up there that is not extreme.",Dangerous_Dot_1638,2025-04-06T21:06:15,1
