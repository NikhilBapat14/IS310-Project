US Journos should coordinate with intl journos to publish stories that are sensitive and likely to draw the DOJ‚Äôs ire so the DOJ can‚Äôt compel someone not in the US to be arrested for protecting sources.,thrillafrommanilla_1,2025-05-03T12:13:12,3

too late... it' going to take 20 years to unravel this and eliminate all the rats that are stashed away in all the corners of government. maybe even more considering this government seems to do much in secret with unrecordable meetings. there's no script to reverse engineer this. It may take a Left side authoritarian to do it quickly and the American left is tied to the rule of law,JaVelin-X-,2025-05-03T07:12:16,33

Am I reading this right? While it seems to smooth over the issue (Bondi must approve subpoenas personally)‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt that mean she can choose subpoenas at will? (Or at a 78 year old man‚Äôs will?) edit for clarity,yodelayhehoo,2025-05-03T08:35:48,3

"it's happening way faster than anyone imagined and  in another 6 months there will be no dissent from the press. everything thats happening will be called good and you'll never hear about the mistakes and bad things. I don't see how Americans are going to stop this now since they haven't acted yet, I meant there's no way they could even organize since social media is more and more an organ of the government. and the old secure ways to communicate are forgotten or no longer function.",JaVelin-X-,2025-05-03T08:14:20,10
"We could have stopped this.   2022 Tufts Data  > National Youth Turnout: 23% - That's lower than in the historic 2018 cycle (28%) which broke records for turnout, but much higher than in 2014, when only 13% of youth voted.  It *is* too late.   There aren‚Äôt enough decent people left in this crumbling nation.   If people couldn‚Äôt be ‚Äòcreative‚Äô enough to fill in a bubble for a lady promising to legalize weed, and having one of the most progressive voting records in the Senate‚Ä¶they‚Äôre not smart enough to pull together for anything else.   We‚Äôre too weak to propaganda, too self absorbed, and too damn stupid to stand together to make any real difference. We‚Äôre a nation of consumers, that thinks buying guns, or snarky signs is political action.   We did this to us‚Ä¶and, half the country is fine with it. A sizable portion will never show up to vote against fascism, or things getting worse. That is silent complicity.   The USA *is* over as we knew it. We have no opposition leadership, and all we care about is shopping. It‚Äôs a failed experiment when your nation elects a rapist/ felon/ traitor, with a manifesto on destroying the country called ‚Äúproject 2025.‚Äù Let‚Äôs not pretend there are enough decent people, with a spine  left to make any sort of difference. There is not.   Straight up Idiocracy.   Unless you take out FoxNews, Joe Rogan, Facebook, Twitter, and somehow stop the Russian/ foreign propaganda‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt win.

"Many meme comments are promoting shipping these fascist bastards to El Salvador without trial. We shouldn't be doing that to anyone. What I speak of is the likes of those who now want the shitty standards to apply to all, instead of fighting the shitty standard.  Instead of seeing the dangers of a police state, since Covod, many more on the left are for hard medical mandates , harsh penalties for hate speech , and weaponization of the justice system in retaliation for that of the gop.    This certainly isn't all of the left, they're very diverse. Too many people like to forget it's not just a liberal / conservative axis, it's also authoritarianism/ libertarianism.
