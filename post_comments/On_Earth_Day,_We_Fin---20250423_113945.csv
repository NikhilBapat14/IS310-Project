"What in the actual propaganda fuck?  First, Covid.gov and Covidtests.gov both start going to straight up conspiracy websites, they're censoring facts from all government websites, and now DPRK level propaganda coming out of Whitehouse.gov.  The reality distorting this administration is engaging in makes anything dreamt up in 1984 seem tame.  Then you see articles like this saying how Gen Z is the least capable generation at decerning fact from fiction online.  https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/04/23/gen-z-media-tiktok-misinformation-00287561  The future isn't looking too bright.
