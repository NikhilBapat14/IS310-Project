"It will come as no surprise to anyone that Kash Patel, who recently made national headlines for his tweet defending the arrest of a Milwaukee judge, has been using a **taxpayer-funded** government jet to attend sporting events and visit his girlfriend.    Nor, will it come as any surprise that a mere [2 years ago, Patel criticized then-FBI Director Christopher Wray for his use of the government's fleet of private aircraft for personal travel](https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/patel-fbi-director-government-jet/).    But, now that Patel is the director, he apparently sees this as simply a perk of his new job.",Ace-Cuddler,2025-04-26T03:33:13,599

>but it is not unusual for the director to take an F.B.I. plane for personal reasons. Directors must fly on government aircraft for their travel because of required access to secure communications equipment.  >Directors must reimburse the government for use of the plane at the price of a commercial ticket ‚Äî much less than it actually costs to operate the expensive jets.  3 personal flights:  The only big deal I'm seeing here is the one Republicans make when it's a Democrat on the plane.,nerphurp,2025-04-26T04:57:31,35

Comey had previously testified that the investigation was closed and was forced to re-open it due to new evidence. He faced a no win decision and would have been crucified either way.
