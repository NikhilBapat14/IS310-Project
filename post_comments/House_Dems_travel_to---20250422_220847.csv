">Democratic Reps. Robert Garcia of California, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon are demanding the White House abide by a court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States. They’re planning to meet with officials at the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia’s release and to get information on other detainees transferred to El Salvador from the U.S.   ...   “What happened to Kilmar Abrego Garcia is not just one family’s nightmare — it is a constitutional crisis that should outrage every single one of us,” Dexter said in a separate statement. “We will not rest while due process is discarded, and our constitutional rights are ignored.”  At the same time:  [Congressional delegation visits grad student, PhD student held in ICE detention](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5262161-congressional-delegation-visit-rumeysa-ozturk-mahmoud-khalil/)  >Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) shared on X that he was heading to Louisiana to demand the release of Ozturk, one of his constituents.  >Markey was joined by fellow Democrats, Reps. Troy Carter (La.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Ayanna Pressley and Jim McGovern (Mass.).   ...   “We have a moral obligation to stand with and unequivocally call out the injustices Mahmoud Khalil and too many others are suffering from at the hand of this administration,” Markey said online.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-22T22:16:33,20

"Four is a start!  Hopefully they inspire the rest of the party to wake up and realize they need to take action if they want to have any future.  There is a lot of stuff going on right now. If the Democrats put together more 4 person teams, they could tackle at least 50 of those issues.  If you are in a losing positiong in chess, one stategy is to make your opponent's life as complicated as possible and hope they slip up.  The Trump administration is good at starting chaos, but they also aren't great at keeping it going. This case has been an excellent demonstration that the Democrats do have power even if they don't have a majority.  The Trump administration can do a lot if they don't face resistance. But if they have to fight dozens of battles at once, they will get frustrated and continue making mistakes. Mistakes that cost them in court and public perception.",LordGothington,2025-04-22T23:05:51,7

"Too many people in this country believe that anyone deemed a ""criminal"" forfeits all rights, up to and including life. We've reached a critical mass of authoritarians, and they're going to continue doing damage until enough people accept that that's the source of the problem.",Crommach,2025-04-22T22:56:23,6
So what’s stopping the next guy to be deported from gunning down ICE agents if he’ll get no due process and gonna be sent to a death camp either way?,d0ntst0pme,2025-04-23T04:03:32,3
"Nothing, that is probably what will be something that happens at some point. If you have not noticed, ICE agents hide their identities, too. They are terrified of being outed publicly because they know that people hate them, and they would get harassed everywhere they go.",Classicman269,2025-04-23T06:41:31,3
