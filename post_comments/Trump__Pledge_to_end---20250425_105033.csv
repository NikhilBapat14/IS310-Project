"This is, of course, simply Trump being Trump.  You can't take anything he says at face value, because he is constantly lying or exaggerating. What he says today will invariably have no connection with the truth and indeed absolutely no connection with what he says tomorrow or the day after.  Such an approach might be considered amusing if he were a retired bus driver, but as the President of the US dealing with major global issues on a round-the-clock basis, it is massively problematic, hugely dangerous and grotesquely embarrassing.  He urgently needs to be impeached.",crazybones,2025-04-25T10:57:28,6

"Anyone else see the video that was released of Witkoff and Putin meeting and shaking hands, and when Putin directed Witkoff to the table a lady sat down next to Witkoff and Witkoff asked ""Are you the interpreter? From the embassy? They sent you? Ok.""  Source (scroll to find the 27 second clip): [https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg7jnywn5dt?page=2](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg7jnywn5dt?page=2)  How the fuck does Witkoff not know who the interpreter is going into a meeting with Putin to discuss a peace settlement? It is a higher likelihood that the interpreter is not from the embassy and is provided by Putin, and they can just make shit up and Witkoff will be none the wiser.  This is amateur hour and should be a scandal. I hope the media ask who the interpreter was and what preparation Witkoff makes when handling these highest of level negotiations.",Skiinz19,2025-04-25T12:20:40,3
