Trump is weak and distracted so he is easily stonewalled. I doubt Trump is willing to actually do anything about it.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-29T09:43:10,3

"Give up on this narrative that the US is acting of its own accord.  Trump is Putin's puppet.  These talks are not a conversation, they are ventriloquism.",Caraes_Naur,2025-04-29T10:57:13,1

"On the contrary the US is finally threatening ""real"" sanctions against Russia in terms of hitting their bank accounts where all the oligarchs thrive off of.   But yeah their patience is growing thin for a deal. Again, end this stupid war already",MichaelPFrancesa,2025-04-29T09:47:33,0
"I mean you make an effort for peace, save lives etc but ya the Russian military and political posture is not going to change anytime soon.",BanginFutes,2025-04-29T16:58:54,1
Trump is perhaps the least malleable US politician of his age as weve seen.     Russia has next to no influence in US politics or economics and says openly it is no longer even interested in doing so.  ( In great contrast to the Israeli lobby China/chamber of commerce. Mexican nationals etc ),BanginFutes,2025-04-29T17:02:43,0
