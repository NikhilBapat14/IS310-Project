"**2-4 Paragraphs:**  The Trump administration sent them to a prison in El Salvador under a wartime act, calling them members of a Venezuelan gang. But a New York Times investigation found little evidence of criminal backgrounds or links to the gang.  Nathali S치nchez last heard from her husband on March 14, when he called from a Texas detention center to say he was being deported back to Venezuela. Later that night, he texted her through a government messaging app for detainees.  Her husband, Arturo Su치rez Trejo, 33, a musician, had been in American custody for a month, calling every few days to assure his family that he was OK, his relatives said.

But less than a day later, Mr. Su치rez was shackled, loaded onto a plane and sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, according to an internal government list of detainees obtained by The New York Times.
