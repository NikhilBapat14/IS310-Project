"I've already noticed a 20% increase in prices from a company I order from which imports coffee directly from overseas. In fairness, their prices did *not* rise much during the post-pandemic inflation of 2022.  But Trump import taxes (AKA: tariffs) have already been worse than Biden inflation.  And we should make an extra effort to call them by their rightful name: **Trump import taxes**. Dems need to get better at messaging.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-09T08:50:33,5
