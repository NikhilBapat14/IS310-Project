People voted for Trump because prices were too high … wait 2 months now,supercali45,2025-04-26T22:28:58,9
"This article is all about ""To little, to late."" In terms of being written. Back in the mid-1970's when out-sourcing jobs in America to over-sea countries like China would have been the proper time to write this article. Strangely post out-sourcing America, was also the last time our Nation was the greatest country in the world.  Trump making this all about Trade Deficits is the dumbest thing in the world. Of course this is all about trade deficits, we outsourced all our jobs and have nothing left to trade, we don't made anything. Robber Barons have been complaining for decades that it is too expensive to make things in America and that rising labor costs hurt everyone.  It was never true. We were once the greatest country in the world because we paid our workers well; that all ended under Reagan's Trickle Down Economics., what outsourcing was really all about, all along, is Trickle Down Poverty and increasing the wages of the top one-percent.",americanspirit64,2025-04-27T05:38:13,3

"Oh yeah. And even Trump backs off on the tariffs, that's still going to happen. Because the goods are not on the ships from China right now. According to a report I saw this week, shipping from China is down 40%.  And of course, the US dollar has fallen enough that a lot of imported goods are going to go up in price regardless of tariff.",raistlin65,2025-04-26T19:12:37,14
"Absolutely. Not only that, but it'll create a stagflationary situation too.",jayfeather31,2025-04-26T19:26:52,4
Prices can’t be high if there ain’t nothing to buy. Argue with that logic liberal /s,young4790,2025-04-27T06:16:24,2
"Yup.   I think may 9th or 5th is when the last pre-liberation day shipments arrive. Even if tariffs are lifted, it'll be at least 3-5 weeks before any corrective action changes things. Plus the time it takes for any such action to happen. Plus the chaos and confusion of extra shipments in harbors, inevitable bottlenecks and trucks in the wrong place.   Summer will see the worst tourism season in living memory apart from pandemic levels.    Meanwhile team trump is jailing judges, kidnapping and trafficking toddlers, cutting taxes on rich people and declaring war on trans people. You know, the important things.",s-mores,2025-04-27T03:49:21,5
The only reason I started going back to the store was because they had stuff again. Back to Amazon,now_error_later,2025-04-27T06:18:59,1

"It was more of a mindset like oh I’m out doing X I’ll stop at the store after work vs why bother going to a physical store, people are ruder and half the stuff is gone and I can figure out replacements in recliner on Amazon",now_error_later,2025-04-27T09:31:15,2
