DOGE is there to copy Americans' most private data for Musk's profit and to get  government contracts awarded to Musk. Saving money has never been the goal.,FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-29T15:13:32,8

"Musk paid $277 million for the most confidential information on every living American. For a man of his wealth, it’s peanuts.   I think most people assumed America was a whore, but I never expected her to sell herself so cheap.",Worried-Rub-7747,2025-04-29T15:03:21,1
Doge can efficiently spend money without any of the unnecessary product to show for it.,CitySeekerTron,2025-04-29T17:21:16,1
Its goal was to dismantle the federal govt and kill all investigations in to Tesla and space x. Trump is an anarchist and wants to return to the Wild West of powerful men. He can then cosplay being something better then himself.,Complete-Breakfast90,2025-04-29T19:11:21,1
By pure coincidence I’m sure… that is like perfect money laundering. A near 1:1 ratio? Legal protection too??,Krunkledunker,2025-04-29T19:25:05,1
Going to cost way more over the next decades trying to unfuck this stuff.,kuebel33,2025-04-29T20:38:58,1
"Just crickets from conservatives. They framed it like the left didn't want to make the government more efficient because they were defrauding it.. meanwhile, the left was worried that they would cut and gut functional pieces of our regulatory body without saving any money. In fact, I was convinced from day one that we were going to spend more money every year than we did except for COVID recovery because that's EXACTLY what happened in Trump's first term.  Conservatives spend so much fucking money. And then when Democrats are in charge, Republicans say no no no, we can't afford that. And threaten to shut down the government multiple times, forcing Dems to concede because they don't want the government to shutdown and the country to suffer. The GOP doesn't give a shit they just want to win.",DroDameron,2025-04-30T06:57:55,1

"I think they mean the loss of expertise, experience, data, and material. It will likely cost a future govt far more to rebuild the scientific and technological leadership that was the US govt than it would have been to maintain these low cost high reward expenses which are short term politically easier to cut than medicare/medicaid or the military or ssa which are far bigger and more bloated expenses but will be much more unpopular to cut into for savings.",ArtLye,2025-04-29T23:58:27,3
