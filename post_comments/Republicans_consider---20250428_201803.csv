"> Top Republicans are considering rolling back a major piece of the Affordable Care Act in their massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda, exploring savings by slashing how much money the federal government spends to cover the 2010 law's expansion of Medicaid.  >Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., the chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the case for it Monday as Congress returned from a two-week recess, saying Medicaid spending is growing at an unsustainable rate.  >“We have an expansion population that gets 90% federal money, and you have traditional [Medicaid], so a disabled child in Kentucky gets 72 cents when they go to the doctor. And we know that’s just unsustainable,” Guthrie said. “We want to fix that so everybody gets coverage. So I think it’s going to be a really responsible response.”  >Guthrie’s committee is tasked with finding $880 billion in savings, a target that can't be met without cutting Medicaid or Medicare, according to Congress' nonpartisan budget scorekeeper.  >The menu of options includes changes to Medicaid’s Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (or FMAP) and a new per capita cap on the population of people covered under the expansion. While Guthrie didn’t confirm what will make it into the package, he said he’d like to finalize it and vote it out of committee next week.  >The 90% federal match was a linchpin of the Medicaid expansion under the ACA, also known as Obamacare, enticing states to adopt the provision, which has since extended coverage to an estimated 20 million people in more than 40 states.  >“The ACA took a three-pronged approach to increasing access to health coverage — Medicaid expansion, tax credits to make premiums more affordable for those who lack employer-provided insurance and pre-existing condition protections. The Medicaid expansion has been a key part of reducing the uninsured rate to the lowest levels in history,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a research group.  >Levitt called the 90% federal promise “key to getting both red and blue states to take” the Medicaid expansion after the Supreme Court made it optional. Lowering it to the traditional rate the feds pay on Medicaid “would be a huge cost shift to states, and many would have difficulty coming up with the extra money,” he added. “Some states even have triggers that would eliminate the expansion if the match rate is lowered.”  Republicans are ghouls that would rather see millions without healthcare insurance than to increase taxes on the 1% by 1%.",[deleted],2025-04-28T20:21:05,38

I agree with this. This is one of the few things that I think would turn a portion of Trumps base against him and even more so the GOP. He will always have his most loyal base but this would sting. ,Current_Animator7546,2025-04-28T21:02:42,7
