"The US generally had a policy of ""isolationism"" prior to WWII. Woodrow Wilson won re-election in 1916 on a platform of remaining ""neutral"" in WWI. He walked back that promise only after he was elected and put the US in WWI after he was re-elected.  So when WWI ended, many politicians wanted the US to return to isolationism, and were afraid entering into the League of Nations would drag the US into European and other foreign conflicts. So while Wilson helped set up the organization, his pleas for the US to join were rejected by Congress who preferred to return to the pre-WWI mindset of isolationism.  That was the major reason for the US failing to join after WWI.",ProLifePanda,2023-01-18T10:16:21,2
