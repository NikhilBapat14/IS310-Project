"This has to be the worst 100 days in office ever. Economy is the worst ever, unemployment is skyrocketing, inflation is out of control, businesses are shutting down, everyone is angry at the government, Congress isn't showing up to work, women are dying from failed pregnancies and no doctor will treat them, diseases are killing our children at a record pace, taxes are the highest they have ever been, corruption is unchecked, absolutely nothing positive has occurred in these 100 days.",BoringThePerson,2025-04-24T07:31:18,48
I started a new job two weeks ago and worked remotely for half of that time. Pretty sure I've spent more time in my office than this guy has in the last 100 days,themattboard,2025-04-24T07:27:41,16

"Macomb County... outskirts of Detroit, and damned close to Canada. I wonder what nonsense he's going to spew from the podium about Canada and trade that day. Probably a good idea to run real-time DOW tickers on the graphic overlay while the clown is speaking.",steve_ample,2025-04-24T07:38:21,7

"Remember all of Biden's self-congratulatory rallies? And Obama, 100 days after inheriting the worst economic disaster of our lifetimes from his Republican predecessor, infamously had a huge public rally with his name emblazoned on massive signs surrounding the podium. The nerve of those arrogant Democrats!  People in Michigan may be worse off than they were 100 days ago because of this administration's policies, but at least they have the man responsible for their hardship coming to publicly celebrate himself!",dietTAB,2025-04-24T07:52:53,7

"He could of course use this as an opportunity to show some growth, and humility, and maybe even to do a serious reset.  Of course what he'll actually do is just trot out the 'old hits' that the Maga dumbasses eat up.

I’m sure it will be an incredible insightful speech about economic policy / foreign policy / how he will lead the USA to be the envy of the world.

His ego must have taken a hit in the past few weeks so he needs to bathe in his own farts for a bit.,prodigalpariah,2025-04-24T08:12:27,1

How many paid sponsors and actors will be in attendance?   I heard his ratings are hitting 37% which is where he left off in his first term. I bet the protests will be bigger than his rally.

"Technically, your first three points are incorrect. Based on US bureau of Labour Statistic, US economy is still resilient, unemployment still holding at 4% according to US indicators and inflation actually fell to 2.3% (https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.us.htm).   BUT, you can argue (quite strongly) that these carry-over from the previous administration and the inflation fall largely due to falling oil price which is not a good thing.
