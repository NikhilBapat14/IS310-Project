"Saddam was sunni and he empowered sunni millitias from his hometown and raised an army of mostly sunni soldiers he could rely on to pacify and brutalise the Kurds and Shia.  The Republican Guard were feared in Iraq as  Saddam's enforcers.     When America invaded, the Kurds and Shia were happy to be freed of Saddam and were willing to work with American Soldiers. This earned them considerable autonomy.     The worst mistake the US did was disassemble the Iraqi Republican Guard, which saw thousands of Iraqi soldiers and officers suddenly without a job. They were not allowed into the new Iraq army as the US didn't trust them      Many of them joined Sunni millitias, some of whom joined ISIS. Including 41% of the officer class.",brinz1,2024-09-10T09:32:52,14
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Saddam was Sunni, and he repressed the Shiite minority pretty heavily. So when the US came to depose him, the Shiites were only too happy to ally themselves with that cause. Even the short-sighted idiots in the Bush administration eventually realized they needed allies for the war and reconstruction, and the Shiites were simply the best candidates. We created a new government and virtually installed the new prime minister, Nouri Al-Maliki. One important thing to remember here is that bush is fundamentally a people person, who thrives at building personal relationships - a big part of his political success. And Bush was reportedly very fond of Maliki - they spoke often and at length, and Bush provided massive assistance to Maliki on many levels. There's a famous anecdote of a time when Maliki's personal safety was threatened by Sunni insurgents, and Bush ordered the US military to do basically whatever it took to keep him safe, which (IIRC) meant massive airstrikes all around the prime minister's residence.",Short-Coast9042,2024-09-10T11:21:22,2
"One of the persistent issues in the decisions regarding Iraq is that the Bush administration had a bit of a bifurcation of perspectives in its advising team. One the one hand, we had the Department of Defense faction, led by Rumsfeld. This faction relied much more heavily as you said on exiled Iraqis for its understanding of the unique and specific concerns you would find in the Middle East/Iraq. The other faction was the State Department faction, led by Powell. This faction instead relied on long standing academics and experts in the Middle East for much of its advice. These two groups often found themselves giving contrasting advice and had to compete for Bush's ears and eyes, and usually Rumsfeld won out.  I don't really think there's too much data supporting the idea that Bush was just salty. In all the sources I've read on topic Bush seeking revenge isn't really a common thread. He does express distrust towards Hussein...but that's not entirely surprising or undeserved. To me, the issues in decision making regarding Iraq are more just a perfect example of Bush's limitations when it came to effective leadership. He wasn't capable of creating a unified, diverse, and effective team, including differing voices. He got stuck in a pattern of groupthink, and with every decision he reinforced this ""chosen side vs. unpopular kids"" dynamic in his administration.  I mean, the State Department advised Bush to take a more scaled-back version of De-Ba'athification similar to Denazification. He chose instead to do scorched earth as advised by DoD. The State Islamists were advising against empowering the minority Shiite faction, the DoD was saying it was fine. In addition to a number of other similarly impactful decisions where Bush was given competing options and just chose DoD every time, despite the repeated failures. Generally speaking, it seems Bush's plan was ""trust your advisors"" which is usually a really solid and good plan. But Bush did it in a way that was possibly the worst way to do that plan, and it ended up blowing up in his face.",mormagils,2024-09-10T12:17:08,2

"> The worst mistake the US did was disassemble the Iraqi Republican Guard, which saw thousands of Iraqi soldiers and officers suddenly without a job. They were not allowed into the new Iraq army as the US didn't trust them  This cannot be overstated.  It was a mind-bogglingly bad decision.   I mean, what did they think would happen?  There was a big shortage of jobs, these guys were used to being military, and there just happened to be groups eager to recruit men to fight.  Of course there were issues with keeping these guiys in Iraqi armed forces but a lot of that could have been mitigated by splitting them up into different units and not having them so concentrated.  At least then the US and new govt would have a leash on them.  I still remember the day when I heard about this on the news.  I couldn't believe it, and the guys I would casually talk with about world affairs also couldn't believe it.",ptwonline,2024-09-10T13:07:47,6
>The worst mistake the US did was  invading Iraq in the first place.  Not that Cheney and pals saw it as a mistake - they just saw an opportunity for profit and took it.  Inventing lies about WMD's to sell this imperialist project which killed a million Iraqis.,Zeydon,2024-09-10T16:27:40,1

"Not true, while the top of the Baath party were Sunni, but only because they were from Saddam's clan who happened to be sunni Muslims. Plus, anyone who held higher-position jobs in Iraq under Saddam's regime had to obtain party membership to get the job, and there were Shiite Ba'athists.",First_Season_9621,2024-09-10T15:42:15,1
"A great resource for this general discussion is Chanrasekaran's *Life in the Emerald City*. Also, Irving Janis wrote a great book on presidential groupthink that, if I'm remembering correctly, discusses how Bush was exactly the opposite of what good decision making looks like while JFK was the poster boy for good decision making process. I unfortunately don't remember all I read on this topic off the top of my head, but there's a TON of great literature out there on the Iraq War and Bush's poor decision making process. We were very fortunate to have a rather well documented look into how exactly these decisions were made and what the other options were.",mormagils,2024-09-10T12:30:42,1
