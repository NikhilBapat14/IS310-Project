"I couldn’t include it in the text but this is what I would’ve included in the body.   I already grow tired of Elissa Slotkin. In her rebuke speech of Trumps address to congress she was essentially a moderate republican, saying “Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave” (yeah, glaze the guy who’s responsible for sending hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas, that’ll get you more vote). Then, she takes multiple petty shots at democrats actually using their voice to fight back, and quite frankly Bernie and AOC have done more with that tour and their voice than slotkin has done at all. I’m so sick of these blue dog dems acting like they’re somehow better than progressives. Also; slotkins new approach is basically for dems to become more like manosphere influencers, “adopting alpha male energy”. Not much different from a republican….",Roguepepper_9606,2025-04-30T17:18:22,42
Elissa is a conservative. Democrats like her exist only to hold back progress. ,Virbillion,2025-04-30T17:17:22,36
"Slotkin is a female Joe Manchin in a red fucking state. Just shut the fuck up. 90 million sat this out because of your same old fucking ""be more moderate"" bullshit. Neither candidate in this last election were liberal. So just maybe... Some of those 90 million MIGHT be interested in a progressive (whoever that may be) candidate.",williamgman,2025-04-30T19:35:08,16
Elissa Slotkin is a corporate stooge and traitor to the American people. I wouldn't wipe a weisel's dirty dick on her.,ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-30T17:47:39,23

Isnt Slotkin an heiress to a hot dog fortune? ,khorne3,2025-05-01T06:31:14,2
Give her some Ozempic and botox and maga will think she is one of their leaders.,George_the_poinsetta,2025-04-30T18:24:24,2
"They basically agree, Slotkin just recognizes swing voters for the dumbfucks they are where the sheer number of syllables in oligarchy don't resonate with them the way kings does. Hardly a disagreement, Bernie just hasn't had to surround himself with stupid to win a swing state.",SoupSpelunker,2025-05-01T07:02:53,1

"Not even. Michigan is probably the most blue out of the rust belt, she’s got no excuse acting like this. At least manchin could pull the R+30 excuse",Roguepepper_9606,2025-04-30T22:28:39,5

Nah fuck oligarchs. They can go the fuck away or they can become beef stew ,Juicybusey20,2025-04-30T17:21:28,6
I'm sure you guys think she's cracked the code to finally make Republicans like you. Surely it'll work this time around.,Undorkins,2025-04-30T18:14:12,11
"When the democracy and constitution of the us are under attack by this admin I don't really care what capitulators think. She is very much the ""they won't deport me"" mentality until they come for her as well. You can take the appeasement route if you like but history has shown what appeasing dictators leads too.",SPACE_ICE,2025-04-30T17:52:37,11
"you are probably a conservative as well. i don't know if you've noticed, but bad politics can be very popular and lucrative.",Virbillion,2025-04-30T17:49:45,11
