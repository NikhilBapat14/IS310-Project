A dude in another thread was saying the sky is falling and grassroots actions do nothing. I think this is a prime example of the system holding.  YES!! Cheeto will throw shit at the wall..lots of it all at once to keep us chasing our tails BUT for now the system is holding :)  This is a very good thing.,SingleRefrigerator45,2025-04-23T12:30:52,47

">“RALEIGH, N.C. (WTVD) -- There is a new chapter in the still-undecided race for a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court.”  It's genuinely reassuring, seeing this unfold, it's great that this is the only race in the country still unresolved, showing just how critical it is to protect the integrity of elections, and it's great news to see things heading in the right direction... a real key to our legal system, I think.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-23T12:41:44,20
"I'm still amused the GOP is claiming 60,000 fraudulent votes, but have no evidence and refuse to press charges against any of the alleged fraudulent voters. They're just crying and whining because they're sore losers.",sugarlessdeathbear,2025-04-23T14:25:04,20
"Good, because these assholes are trying to steal an election.",Foucaultshadow1,2025-04-23T13:06:04,11
"I’m glad about the outcome, but it should have never come to this. I wish Jefferson Griffin—and Republicans in office more broadly—were capable of feeling shame for resorting to these tactics. I understand that, for them, it’s all about holding onto power at any cost, but conceding after a loss should be the norm. This was not only cringe-worthy but a waste of time and money.",Sunstarch,2025-04-23T14:47:53,7
The article is thin on details.  It does mention that the race is still not called so what are the next steps before this whole thing is over?,Brewski26,2025-04-23T12:41:14,4
Yes! It is.,SAJ-13,2025-04-23T12:38:20,36
"60,000 fraudulent votes... but just for that one electoral race! We wanna keep them for the electoral races we won!!1!!1  They are ridiculous as well as fascistic.",Moonspindrift,2025-04-23T15:38:29,9
They claim it because they changed the rules AFTER the election and are trying to say it now applies to ballots already cast.,Abranimal,2025-04-23T18:10:25,4
I suspect this was an attempt at proof-of-concept ahead of the midterms and the 2028 presidential election.,Moonspindrift,2025-04-23T15:39:50,3
"The judges will have to decide which ballots count or don’t count as valid for curing, when/if they do they’ll send out notices to people who need to cure them and when they have to do so by (like saying “present your ID to us by May 20th and we’ll count your vote” or something), and then count them from there to finalize who the winner is.  Then again, if it’s decided all the ballots except a few (less than the 700ish the winner won by) are valid and don’t have anything wrong with them, it wouldn’t even be necessary just because she would have a big enough margin to win even if every one of them didn’t come back cured. If they do eventually decide enough of the ballots aren’t good enough though see above steps for however many had to be cured",Lostsock1995,2025-04-23T14:27:02,2
