">“Every time Zelensky starts waffling on terms, it seems that Ukraine gets hit again. Maybe Zelensky should stop waffling.”  I say this every time but these anti-Ukraine people always remind me of the ""She was wearing a short skirt"" type of people. They're the same people.",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T13:08:39,12

It’s own of those AI articles that get thrown together and posted for a few clicks. Substance doesn’t matter when you can have software grab some clickbait material off of the internet and post it and all it cost was 10 seconds of your time.,Peacefulgamer2023,2025-04-24T13:17:30,2
