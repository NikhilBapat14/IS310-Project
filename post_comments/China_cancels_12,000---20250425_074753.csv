"China owns Smithfield meats. Stop buying Smithfield products if China wants to play pork games.   Smithfield Foods is the parent company to several well-known meat brands, including Smithfield, Eckrich, Nathan's Famous, Farmer John, Farmland, Armour, and more. Other brands owned by Smithfield include Gwaltney, John Morrell, Kretschmar, and Margherita Meats. They also offer products under the Smithfield Culinary brand for foodservice operators.¬†",CommonPainter5770,2025-04-25T08:21:05,650

"Can anyone make sense of this article?  Are we shipping pork to China or is China shipping pork to the US?  Let me analyze the article, starting with the title:  > China cancels 12,000 metric tons of US pork shipments  **Sounds like the US is shipping the pork**  > China canceled 12,000 metric tons of United States pork shipments amid a high-stakes trade standoff between the superpowers, according to data released Thursday.  **Sounds like US is shipping the pork.**  > China, one of the biggest U.S. trading partners, axed 12,000 metric tons of U.S. pork orders, the data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) shows.  **""U.S. pork orders"" could be US orders, or orders from China of US pork - so it could go either way, but since China cancelled it, I'd say it's US shipping to China.**  > The move represents the biggest cancellation of pork orders since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and stalled economies around the world, Bloomberg News reported.   > China, behind Mexico and Japan, was the U.S.‚Äôs third-biggest market for pork in 2024, importing some 475,000 metric tons valued at more than $1.1 billion. **Sounds like US is shipping and selling pork to China.**  > China is the world‚Äôs biggest producer of pork, accounting for nearly 50 percent of global supply at around 57 million metric tons, according to the USDA. The U.S. was ranked third at 11 percent with 12 million metric tons.  **OK now we seem to be talking about China producing (and shipping) pork.   WTF.**  > President Trump shook the global trading system by imposing sweeping tariffs earlier this month on dozens of countries. He slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods coming into the U.S., prompting China to fire back with its own 125 percent duty.   > China said Thursday that the U.S. is not engaged in talks to come up with a new trade deal, a characterization that Trump rejected later in the day.   > ‚ÄúThey had meetings this morning, and we‚Äôve been meeting with China. And, so I think you have ‚Ä¶ as usual, I think you have your reporting wrong,‚Äù Trump told reporters Thursday.    > After the tariff hikes, China inked two agricultural trade agreements with Spain, for pork and cherries, as Beijing looks to strengthen relations with European countries, Reuters reported.  > U.S. pork imports are now facing a 172 percent tariff, the U.S. Meat Export Federation said, according to Bloomberg News. **OK, this is talking about US pork imports.  So are these Chinese tariffs on US Pork, or US tariffs on China's pork coming to the US?**",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-25T13:02:19,9

China refusing to negotiate with the US has caused millions of people in China to lose their jobs. Food was already expensive, and playing this game will only make it more expensive.

Nobody lost their job, and none of the employees had a missed paycheck. Company profits were a little short, and the people had to work a little harder. That's all.   Now let's look at what's happening in China.... I don't feel like I need to repeat myself again, but I'll go ahead and do it anyways. Several companies in China shut down.

A loss hurts a business even 1 dollar hurts the bottom line no matter how minuscule you decide the loss is.   You specifically said it will not hurt. Then doubled down and said you never said it. Then tripled down and said you did say it but I can‚Äôt comprehend the definition of hurt. Which has a definition of to ‚Äúbe detrimental to‚Äù idk what profitable business you own but doing is business at a loss is detrimental to the business. So yes I can read and comprehend and you are the idiot.  Just because someone hurts more doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt also hurt.
