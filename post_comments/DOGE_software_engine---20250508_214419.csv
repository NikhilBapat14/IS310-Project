"Kyle Schutt is a 30-something-year-old software engineer who, according to [Dropsite News](https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/doge-fema-funding-access-social-security-numbers), gained access in February to a “core financial management system” belonging to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As an employee of DOGE, Schutt accessed FEMA’s proprietary software for managing both disaster and non-disaster funding grants. Under his role at CISA, he likely is privy to sensitive information regarding the security of civilian federal government networks and critical infrastructure throughout the US.  According to journalist [Micah Lee](https://micahflee.com/doge-bro-kyle-schutts-computer-infected-by-malware-credentials-found-in-stealer-logs/), user names and passwords for logging in to various accounts belonging to Schutt have been published at least four times since 2023 in logs from stealer malware. Stealer malware typically infects devices through trojanized apps, phishing, or software exploits. Besides pilfering login credentials, stealers can also log all keystrokes and capture or record screen output. The data is then sent to the attacker and, occasionally after that, can make its way into public credential dumps.",Smithy2232,2025-05-08T21:49:08,13
"The main problem with the doge software engineers (Still in Diapers) is, who wstching over them ensuring safety and security? NSA FBI it doesn't matter, Trump Vance Elon Miller just want dige to run wild and free without constraints. Does Trump even know how to use a computer? Is his password his D.C. Street Address?",Pixburghman,2025-05-08T21:55:37,8
"So this is the out for elon and trump. Their traitor tots weren't intentionally collecting and sending data to third party servers, doge computers were instead compromised by malware.

"One of my previous employers had an internal motto called “fast follow, break stuff!” In the video game world. E3’s, GDC’s, and industry perks were hella fun in your 20s/early 30’s.

"I have bad news, being a software engineer means you can write code, it doesn't mean you have general IT competence.  And there are a lot of software engineers like that.

"Given all we know, I think it has to be assumed that essentially all US secrets which existed on systems Musk's incels were allowed in the same building as have been compromised, and the only way to secure or ensure the integrity of systems they've touched going forward is to start from scratch.  In my opinion, even the most dire critical reporting on this situation hasn't come close to grasping the extent of the damage done... and we're all in for some really unpleasant reality checks over the next several years as it becomes apparent. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I have a feeling the damages, in financial terms, will be well into the trillions once the costs of recovery are factored in - if recovery is possible at all.",Prior-Tea-3468,2025-05-08T22:58:48,16
