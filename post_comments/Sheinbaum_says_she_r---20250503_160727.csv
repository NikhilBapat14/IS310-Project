"People have a lot of misconceptions about the war on drugs. They think narcos are just allowed to do whatever they want. It couldn’t be further from the truth. Pretty much every major player in the history of Mexican cartels is either in prison or dead. People see bigger than life figures like El Chapo and think of the wealth and power but don’t seem to know that El Chapo spent half of his adult life behind bars and much of the rest on the run.   Every time there’s a confrontation between sicarios and the Mexican military, the sicarios get annihilated. These people are hardly professional fighters. They’re just mexican rednecks with guns. A lot of the time they just run away from any confrontation.   The issue has never been that Mexico can’t target the cartels. It’s that every time 20 sicarios get arrested, there are 20 new sicarios in their place the next day. No one is irreplaceable from the very top to the very bottom. Shit, you can destroy the entire cartel like they did with the Zetas and a new one will take its place.   America still hasn’t learned the lesson after losing multiple wars against guerilla insurgents. You can easily kill people. You can’t easily kill an ideology and fix the root cause of the problem. Israel reduced Gaza to rubble. Hamas is still there and they still haven’t rescued their hostages. It’s always the same thing. You can’t fix shit with bombs.",Much_Guava_1396,2025-05-03T17:40:18,17

"They will absolutely fight to the death, because there’s tens of billions of dollars on the line. They are already fighting against insurmountable odds, because the lifespan of a sicarios is pretty short. Their lives are full of violence and death.

Nothing US soldiers can do to the, will come close to what other cartels do to them on a regular basis. Ever seen a man get skinned alive? Or cut with a chainsaw? Or have his limbs cut off and beating heart ripped from his chest?      They also don’t need to commit suicide bombings to hurt the U.S. they literally have total control over a huge chunk of the drug supply that goes into the US. If they wanted to go scorched earth they could lace a chunk of the drug supply with lethal doses of fentanyl and cause a mass casualty event all over the country.

"**Hard disagree.** While it’s true that cartel violence is brutal and that some sicarios are willing to die for their cause, that doesn’t mean they’d willingly go toe-to-toe in open combat with a professional military force like the U.S. Army. Cartels thrive on asymmetry—stealth, corruption, fear, and strategic violence—not suicidal stand-offs with tanks and drones. The idea that they’d “fight to the death” en masse is dramatic but detached from how they actually operate. They’d more likely scatter, adapt, or go underground, as history has shown again and again.  Also, the fentanyl threat is very real, but the notion that cartels would intentionally cause a mass-casualty event across the U.S. ignores the core logic of organized crime: profit. Killing off your customer base and inviting overwhelming retaliation from the U.S. government would be bad business. These groups are brutal, yes—but not irrational.
