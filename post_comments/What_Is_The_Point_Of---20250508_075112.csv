It's not just the GOP. It seems like over the last 20-30 years there has been this push to govern through the president (and EOs) instead of through congress.,mojo276,2025-05-08T08:08:06,436

"We have a tiny majority, and as this sub reflects, ""Conservatism"" is far more than just single-minded philosophy.  What the author complains about is in many ways the problem - these ""wayward"" conservatives are representing their constituents in a way that gets them re-elected, not the entire country, or Pres.

"We’re all fucked. Congress is never going to do anything truly useful for the people again. Each party will have such a slim minority the only stuff they’ll get passed are more pork filled budget bills and other useless shit that wastes our money. The President will do some useful stuff via EO, which will then be undone next time the presidency flips. And the other side will sue them all the way to stop them.
