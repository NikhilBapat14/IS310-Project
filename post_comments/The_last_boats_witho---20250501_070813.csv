"Did you miss COVID?  The lock downs?  The empty shovels?  Well, welcome to 2025!  Where a truly preventable disease is now surging. And while before there was a Doctor doing his best to help, we now have a brain worm guy in charge. Hurray!   Do you miss being stuck in with your family? Well boy the Trump DoJ has you covered, covered in a black bag that is! You won't want to go outside with this chance of being deported, hell don't stay inside because the 4^th amendment can be so annoying, and therefore ignored in the name of MAGA.   And where a truly preventable economic crisis is being forced upon because the current president is an idiot, a stooge, or both! But don't worry something something Gaza, something something her laugh. Luckily, we are laughing now at our new forced diets or lack of expendable income, because that's what's we voted for! Economic ~~prosperity~~ collapse   I am so happy. You should be too!",HandSack135,2025-05-01T07:16:34,84

"But how will poor, rural MAGA voters get by? They rely on cheap Chinese products to live a basic life and Trump has taken that away from them.   They get what they voted for. Enjoy those limited options at higher prices, and likely to concide with uncertain job prospects.   I'm sure they'll be looking for those horrible, terrible, ""socialist"" goverment handouts to compensate.",ATA_PREMIUM,2025-05-01T08:01:37,11

Already stocked up on over the counter pain relievers and allergy meds to get the family through the year since most come from China. Bonus was after we ordered everything we will need we then cancelled our Prime account as a middle finger to Bezos.,feellikebeingajerk,2025-05-01T15:43:41,2

"This 💯%. Don’t forget personal care items like soap, body washes, shampoos, razor heads, lotions, etc. A lot of these will state somewhere on the container what it’s made of - ‘made from domestic and international ingredients’. If it contains something produced outside the U.S. it should be stocked up on. Really, even if it’s made in the U.S. because, you know, tariffs and corporate price-gouging. Basic necessities like  underwear, T’s, socks and shoes are a good idea too.   I refuse to pay for my next (already spendy) running shoes with an ungodly, unnecessary tariff attached to it. 🙄",PickledKingPin,2025-05-01T08:26:40,13
"The first thing I did the day after Election Day was schedule surgery to be medically sterilized.  Then, I started stockpiling goods and food. I have probably half a year of canned goods stocked; they do go bad, so I didn’t go TOO crazy. And then I turned into a prepper and ordered probably another 18 months of freeze-dried canned food. 18 months if we’re just supporting me and my husband. Less if we have to support friends and family. We have a trans friend we told we’d hide in our house if need be. We have Puerto Rican friend we told the same to, but he says he’ll just go back to PR if necessary. (If he has a chance to before ICE decides he’s not an American after ll.) I have a very good friend who is a naturalized citizen who immigrated here from China when she was a kid. On the plus side, my cousin’s husband’s parent is Canadian, and apparently that’s close enough to allow him and his family and also us to move Canada.   I still can’t believe I’m talking about this kind of shit. “I’m sorry. I thought this was America.”",Damn_Dog_Inappropes,2025-05-01T10:37:21,1
"It’s critical that people stock up on staples *that they actually eat*.  Their daily brands, not a bunch of things they imagine from a survivalist show.  If you don’t generally eat tuna or beans or oats then don’t stock up on those. They will just go to waste in your pantry.",sylbug,2025-05-02T14:02:54,0

"Just a reminder that Canada is as sovereign nation and is not here to bail you out after you destroy your own country. Also a reminder that our residency requirements involve a bit more than having a random relative here, and that we don’t have the capacity for American refugees even if we had the will.  Most important: America has burnt their bridges with Canada. Asking us for help right now is like spitting in our faces.",sylbug,2025-05-02T14:20:11,0
