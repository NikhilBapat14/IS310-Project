"[Archive link](https://archive.ph/Lpyka) >Trump’s order directs federal agencies to “deprioritize enforcement” of statutes and regulations that include disparate-impact liability, which has long enabled courts to stop policies and practices that unfairly exclude people on the basis of protected characteristics such as race, gender and disability. The order also instructs the U.S. attorney general to repeal key components of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that bar any program receiving federal financial support from discrimination based on “race, color, or national origin.”  >The Trump administration argues that disparate-impact liability has handcuffed employers, requiring them to consider race and “racial balancing” to avoid legal liability, which they say is a threat to meritocracy.  An interesting article that discusses the origins of some of these protections Trump is trying to nullify.  More than likely, it means that Trump and Heritage want to get this before SCOTUS so that Alito can further gut the Civil Rights Act.",Infidel8,2025-04-27T06:09:31,21
 The article has the order saying: “which they say is a threat to meritocracy”  The only threat to meritocracy is not hiring people on the basis of qualifications.  Hiring a bunch of people because they lick the orange man’s boot is not meritocracy.  They are afraid to have minorities have the same opportunities because they will be left behind.,NAU80,2025-04-27T06:48:43,15

If they were to use meritocracy they would find that potus and all his appointees are wholly unqualified to hold their respective positions. Just throwing that out there. Tons of people with better qualifications and achievements than all those circus performers in those offices now.,HollowDanO,2025-04-27T06:53:42,11
"The Right is always about enforcing the American Caste System.  Its dimensions are:  RACE RULE: White people above all other. Black people below all others  SEX RULE: Men above women.  SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND IDENTITY RULE: All cis/het people above all LGBTQ people.  CLASS RULE: Owning class above working class above the poor.  CHRISTIAN MEMBERSHIP RULE: Old Testament above New Testament. People proclaiming Christian membership have the right to judge and smite others. And their actions are inherently righteous because of their membership.  DIS/ABILITY RULE: The able have no responsibility to accommodate, support, or include people with mental and physical disabilities.",OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-27T07:54:33,9

"White males are the highest ranking SAT scorers, I didn't crunch the numbers, but if colleges were to use SAT scores as the basis for ""merit"", the upper educated would swiftly become nearly all White. And I have to wonder if income isn't considered part of ""merit"".  SInce retribution is the name of his game, I also wonder which college refused Baron, and tried to pass it off as no space because of DEI obligations.?",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-27T07:13:19,-2

"I came back to read a reply and it won't show and it doesn't say deleted, either.  What I can read of the initial comment it refers to ""well roundedness"" as part of the evaluation process.  My daughter didn't have the extra curriculars that her older brother did-she had a higher class rank at graduation, though. During the college app process it seemed that it was more his gender. I can't believe sports participation pushed him that much higher (although he was a talented athlete in HS)  Also their rural elementary was so small we had to go to other towns for TBall, etc. Even with DEI policies in place back then, it seemed obvious to me that colleges' first choice was wealth, then race, ,then gender-all still had an impact. And SAT scores were part of it too, some had a required score as a baseline, if I recall.   I also think watching PBS helped with their education, and now that's on the axe, too.   Don't forget his remark about Hispanics taking Black jobs. This is about race and financial standing, period.   White people not getting a job/college because of the need to fulfill DEI-What a load. I really get the feeling it was just used as an excuse not to hire someone who was perhaps qualified, but not someone they wanted on the team. Like the woman screaming about a LBGTQ hire over herself...wow, I wouldn't want to work with her, anyhow!",Individual-Guest-123,2025-04-28T06:50:57,1
