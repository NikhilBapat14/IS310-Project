China literally just turned down US goods including planes. They are not playing ball.,Machdame,2025-04-30T00:57:08,28
"Even considering the source, Trump's claim that China will pay his 145% import tariffs is beyond ridiculous, passing well into ""senile dementia"" territory.  First and foremost, the import agent -- not the exporter -- is responsible for paying import tariffs. If Trump is suggesting that China will refund 1.45 times the price of their goods, to US customers in order to pay Trump's sinophobic import tax, do the math. Let's say China sells an electronic part to a US customer for $10. Trump's import tax would make the imported price $24.50. So, is China supposed to send their customer $14.50 to pay Trump's import tax on a product they're selling for $10? Really?  Secondly, as the US declines in manufacturing, science and technology, as well as the complete cutoff of aid to foreign nations in need, China has more than stepped up to fill the void left by Trump's assinine (sic) ""America First"" sloganeering. So China does not need the US market as much as the US needs China's low-cost production. China will gladly sell to the rest of the world, thank you very much.  What a sick joke (but not an amusing one).  If anyone is interested, see link below to informative article from Global 100 law firm Sheppard Mullin.

"China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are.
