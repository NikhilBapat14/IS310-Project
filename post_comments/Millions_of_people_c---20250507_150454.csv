Example from a red state: 38% of people in Montana on Medicaid qualified because of Medicaid expansion. Republican legislature and governor just made it permanent. Senate seat and 2 house seats are up in 2026.,Flimsy-Rooster-3467,2025-05-07T15:12:16,10

"It's not going to matter when a lot of medical equipment is made in China and we're already facing shortages. Diabetic patients who need syringes to administer insulin injections are already facing a looming shortage. Oh, and need heart surgery? Well, it looks like they added Intra-aortic Balloon and Control System to their shortage list recently.   This administration is literally killing Americans for an ego trip.  https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-supply-chain-and-shortages/medical-device-shortages-list  Oh, and add the new incoming tarrif to medication and most of America is royally fucked.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-07T15:38:40,4
"Hey r/politics! Nikol from USA TODAY's audience team here. A nonpartisan analysis said millions of Americans could lose Medicaid health insurance coverage under different Republican Congressional proposals to cut spending to support President Donald Trump's tax cuts and domestic policy agenda.  The estimates of people who could lose Medicaid coverage range from 2.3 million to 8.6 million under different proposals floated by Congressional Republicans, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   The Congressional Democrats asked the CBO to analyze five scenarios that Republicans have reportedly discussed as the House Energy and Commerce Committee seeks $880 billion in savings and spending reductions from Medicaid and other programs under its jurisdiction.  * The CBO estimated reducing federal payments to states that have expanded Medicaid enrollment under the Affordable Care Act would save $710 billion but would cut coverage for 5.5 million enrollees. * Eliminating state provider taxes would save the federal government $668 billion, but 8.6 million people would lose Medicaid coverage, the CBO said. * Three other potential cuts: Capping spending per enrollee for the entire Medicaid population, capping spending per enrollee under the ACA's Medicaid expansion or repealing a Biden administration rule on Medicaid eligibility. The number of people who would lose coverage under those scenarios range from 2.3 million to 5.8 million, according to CBO  **Read more:** [**https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/07/cbo-millions-americans-lose-medicaid-coverage/83495422007/**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/05/07/cbo-millions-americans-lose-medicaid-coverage/83495422007/)",usatoday,2025-05-07T15:05:30,2

Medicaid Expansion is only permanent in Montana if the federal funds continue at the level they currently are. There is a trigger law in place that will eliminate Expansion should the feds lower their rate of funding even .5%. I’m covered via the Expansion program and it both saved my life and has kept me stable and a contributing member of society. I’m not quite sure how I (and millions of others) are expected to survive without health insurance. The ERs are going to be completely overwhelmed when we have to show up there for literally every single medical issue.,MyPartsareLoud,2025-05-07T15:48:41,6
