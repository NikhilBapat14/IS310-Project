"Don't get your hopes up too much. This would be a war with nuclear weapons on both sides. There would be no victory for either side. The only possible outcome where this would not cause world wide destruction is if an attempt at invasion of either Greenland or Canada triggers a mutiny and a civil war in the USA. If they aren't stopped then, it'll never happen because the USA will cease to be a democracy no matter what and mounting internal problems will prompt it to start more wars, as happens with almost every dictatorship.  The very best case scenario is that the threat of rebellion or mutiny scares the USA government away from actually doing it, but then that requires some form of pre-emptive political mobilization in opposition to this (e.g. at state level), and so far that hasn't happened.  That's what we're reduced to IMHO. Hope the USA tears itself apart before its government destroys the world.",barryvm,2025-05-04T13:29:19,6
