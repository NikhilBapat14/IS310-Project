Exactly what Democrats should be saying. The US has removed leaders of other countries for much less.,Interesting-Risk6446,2025-04-23T00:11:39,18

"Exactly. When Trump goes, even if he tried to name a successor (Which he wouldn't) the rest of MAGA goes with him. MAGA would tear itself apart when Trump leaves office, either by impeachment or when he sooner or later keels over and ends up in a pine box. They wouldn't be able to agree on who to follow next, and then turn on each other. There will be nobody in the party who can drum up even half of Trump's support.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T16:54:44,2
"I didn't read the article, but Congressional Dems are formulating ways to remind  Bukele that there will be a time when the Democratic Party is once again in control, and whey they are,  it's not going to be good for Bukele.",crucial_geek,2025-04-26T20:35:25,1
"I mean, his successors are his sons and JD Vance. They purged all the more competent males of a similar age from the party.",Rosebunse,2025-04-28T16:57:48,1
"Exactly. JD Vance doesn't have anywhere near the amount of support that Trump does, he couldn't get even half that support, and neither would anyone else. When Trump is gone one way or another the whole of his regime will fall like the wobbling house of cards that it is. Even if Vance did get in and stay in he'd be on thin ice the entire time and would be easily removed if he tried to do any of the blatantly criminal crap like Trump does, and the same would go for anyone who followed him.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T17:24:53,2
