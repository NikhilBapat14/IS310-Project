"I think it's generally accepted that gay marriage can be codified at the federal level. The problem is finding the votes for it, as any such bill would be subject to the filibuster, requiring 60 votes. Considering the recent ""moral panic"" over grooming of children and ""sexualization and perversion"" of society among Republicans, it's unlikely you find 10 GOP senators to vote on. The House just passed a bill to codify same-sex marriage but is waiting until after midterms to vote, hoping once the election is passed they can find the GOP Senate support in the ""lame-duck"" portion of the Congress.  https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/us/politics/house-gay-marriage-bill.html  https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/15/bipartisan-senate-same-sex-marriage-deal-00056946",ProLifePanda,2022-10-19T14:53:41,6
"Congress cannot remove the ability of the courts to review its actions by a simple law. They would need a Constitutional Amendment to accomplish the ""federal courts shall have no jurisdiction"" part of what you're proposing.  In terms of codifying gay marriage into law, the federal government can set whatever standards for how the federal government recognizes marriage that it wants. The current implementation - which no one has seriously proposed changing - is that it recognizes any marriage recognized by any state.  In theory, Congress could pass a 'full faith and credit' implementation of marriage laws where the various states were required to recognize any marriage recognized by any other state. However, there's no real reason to do so because this is (more or less) how it works right now.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-20T06:21:29,2
"Not quite. You can't just declare a law outside the scope of the Constitution. There wouldn't be much purpose of the SCOTUS if that was the case. The reason ""codify into law"" makes a difference is because for the most part, the Court doesn't really have the power to make legislative decisions. It can't really determine policy positions. As long as a law rests on solid jurisprudence, the SCOTUS can't really undermine it.   Of course, this is hardly a bright line in the sand. Look at Obamacare, or the Voting Rights Act. These were both ""codified into law"" at the outset, and yet various court cases have argued at times that the law has poor jurisprudence and compels things that are conflicting with other parts of the law, leading to successful challenges to that law. Especially if the Court decides to be more activist, they can certainly find a way to justify their involvement. Many feel that Dobbs was such an example of finding some unreasonable new benchmark to apply to what was basically settled law.  But the point is, when there's a whole legislatively-approved law in place that specifically addresses a concept, it's got a much stronger foundation. Put another way, the Voting Rights Act has been dealt a few blows, and it might this coming year be rendered entirely toothless. But, importantly, it took 60 years to do that, and for those 60 years we've seen HUGE progress in the black vote. Meanwhile, with Roe, it took only ONE case to just completely roll everything back entirely because Roe didn't have a statutory anchor to hold it in place.  So passing a law would solve the problem in that it would create a stronger foundation that would be harder to strip away, and could only be done incrementally and over time. But honestly, if it was just that simple to pass a law, then we probably wouldn't be afraid of the Court changing the rules here anyway. Passing a law requires such a high bar to clear these days that it doesn't make the process easier, it only makes it harder.",mormagils,2022-10-20T09:14:35,1
"Government, in general, really has no business defining or ""codifying* marriage in *any* way.  Defining personal relationships is up the *individual* or their respective faiths - not  government.  Government's only proper role, is to recognize - and memorialize, that a person has given another person rights and prerogatives over their life. Period.  No government has the right to approve or disapprove personal relationships.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-11-06T16:03:49,1

">which no one has seriously proposed changing  False. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito explicitly said in their ruling on Dobbs that they’d like to revisit the Supreme Court case that ultimately legalized same sex marriage, and they’ve been openly opposed to the outcome of that decision since it’s inception.   Furthermore a cursory glance shows plenty of GOP congressmen and candidates for office that have openly stated they’d like to ban same sex marriage.

"Not quite. SCOTUS's jurisdiction can be split into two kinds--original jurisdiction, which is determined by statute according to the Constitution, and what I will call appellate jurisdiction, which is determined by the precedent set in Marbury v. Madison and the regular concept of appeals.  The first one, as I said, is determined by statute and governs what are cases that are heard initially in the SCOTUS's jurisdiction. So for example if an international prisoner sued the United States, or if one state sued another state for some reason, or if a federal employee sued for workplace misconduct, etc, whether that would be heard by the SCOTUS or by another court is determined by Congress.  But the other half of jurisdiction is appellate jurisdiction. This has nothing to do with Congress. Appellate jurisdiction occurs when a case is escalated to the SCOTUS on appeal, and in combination with the concept of judicial review created by Marbury v. Madison, allows the SCOTUS to strike down acts of Congress that are contradictory with the Constitution. I mean, this shouldn't be that hard to understand conceptually. If you had let's say a case challenging gay marriage, it would likely be on case first decided in the lower courts, likely at a state level. How would it make any sense for a state to have jurisdiction and an appellate court like a US Circuit Court to have jurisdiction, but then it's unable to be passed to the SCOTUS because Congress says no?  And of course the Constitution wouldn't mention this concept because Marbury v. Madison was decided after the Constitution was already written and ratified. Appealing solely to what the Constitution says on the matter is to rely on incomplete information.",mormagils,2022-10-28T22:10:57,1

"That isn’t true. Thomas and Alito have signaled and demonstrated a willingness to abuse the Court’s power to reverse federal recognition of same sex marriage. Anything on federal policy is under their purview. We need to accurately scope the threat, here.",dunpyklungo,2022-10-20T19:56:48,2
"What are even talking about …if you appeal any case to the supreme courts its literally under the the courts apellet juristiticon and the constitution says “ ….. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have APPELLATE  Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such EXCEPTIONS, and under such REGULATIONS as the Congress shall make.”They literally can exclude any appeal case they wish…how are you arguing against this 😂😂😂😂",[deleted],2022-10-29T08:46:50,1
Marbury V Madison by the way dealt with a case which was brought under SCOUTS original juristiction which was  granted by the judiciary act of 1797. John Marshal ruled the act unconstitutional   because it expanded the courts original juratioon beyond what was granted in the constitution. He did this because he knew Madison was just going the ignore the court if it ruled in favor of Marbury so he granted SCOTUS  the power of judicial review while also appeasing Jefferson and Madison. It had nothing to do with appellate jurisdiction????,[deleted],2022-10-29T09:06:18,1
"The Court decides what cases it has jurisdiction over.  In terms of standing, a state could probably launch a challenge based on federalism issues since this would deny them the ability to set their own marriage laws. Regardless of whether the challenge itself prevailed, Congress attempting to circumvent judicial review would make it a key element in the case - and it's exceedingly unlikely that any Supreme Court would approve of such a clause.  I think you're clutching at straws to justify what you want to believe.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-29T09:24:01,1
"> Thomas and Alito have signaled and demonstrated a willingness to abuse the Court’s power to reverse federal recognition of same sex marriage.  I have never heard either of them make any statement remotely akin to what you're suggesting. Indeed, it would be out-of-character for them to over-rule a federal deferral to state authority.",ViskerRatio,2022-10-20T21:20:01,2
"When Marbury v. Madison established that the Court DOES have the power of judicial review, it gave the SCOTUS the ability to determine if ANY law is conflicting with the Constitution and is therefore invalid. Congress cannot sidestep this process by simply declaring itself immune, or else is wouldn't be a power that would ever be exercised.   It's that simple. If you don't want to take my word for it, read some of the articles here that explain these concepts more effectively than I do: [https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-3/#:\~:text=Article%20III%20Judicial%20Branch&text=The%20Judges%2C%20both%20of%20the,during%20their%20Continuance%20in%20Office](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-3/#:~:text=Article%20III%20Judicial%20Branch&text=The%20Judges%2C%20both%20of%20the,during%20their%20Continuance%20in%20Office).  Especially the first three annotations would be the most relevant.   In general, just reading the words of the Constitution and not looking at relevant case law or interpretation is very poor constitutional scholarship. ""Just read the Article bro"" is a very unreliable point to make. If you put in a little bit of effort to actually listen to the relevant authorities on this question, you'd see that no, Congress cannot simply declare laws outside the scope of judicial review.",mormagils,2022-10-29T10:15:51,1
