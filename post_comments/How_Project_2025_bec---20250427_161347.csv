Project 2025 was written for him.  It's the revised plan based on lessons learned during his first administration.  It's why most all of the authors work for him now or did back then.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-27T16:15:56,61

"When will people start to realize that at best Trump's IQ maybe in the high double digits? The main thing is that the man doesn't have very many brain cells and at this point given his familial history with dementia and Alzheimer's, is rapidly slipping. He can put words together, has word salad, undiagnosed and probably untreated ADHD and a myriad of other factors due to his diet and irregular sleep habits. As was mentioned, his main motivation is his narcissism, his sociopathic personality, and his innate ability to grift people even when they've been gifted many times in the past. As far as project 2025, he couldn't tell you 10 things about it if you held a gun to his head and demanded the answers. He only knows self-preservation, throw others under the bus after you've used them for your own benefit, and grifting. Everything else is just recommendations from those people who are in his immediate presence. Use them and throw them away as needed. Above all else lie, cheat, swindle, steal, then rinse and repeat.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-27T16:34:14,12
"“I have nothing to do with Project 2025,” Trump said in the opening moments of his September debate against Vice President Kamala Harris. “That’s out there. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it, purposely. I’m not going to read it.”",williamgman,2025-04-27T17:10:21,7

"Russ Vought   Vought, one of Project 2025’s top architects, is expected to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the agency that develops the president’s proposed budget and executes the president’s agenda.  Vought plays a prominent role for Project 2025. Not only did he author a chapter on “Executive Office of the President” for the project’s “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise”, but his Center for Renewing America is also a member of Project 2025’s advisory board. According to press reports, Vought “was also deeply involved in drafting Project 2025's playbook for the first 180 days of a new Trump administration.”    Vought was also the architect of Schedule F, a misguided plan to reclassify federal employees as at-will employees who could be fired for any reason. He served as OMB director during Trump’s first administration, during which OMB reclassified 88% of its employees as Schedule F. But the reclassification was not fully implemented at OMB or other agencies, and President Biden repealed Trump’s Schedule F directive after he took office.    Vought recently said in an interview, “There certainly is going to be mass layoffs and firings, particularly at some of the agencies that we don’t even think should exist.”   Stephen Miller   Miller is Trump’s pick to serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy and the president’s homeland security adviser.   He is Trump’s former adviser and the head of the conservative legal activist group, America First Legal, which served as one of Project 2025’s advisory organizations. Miller was also featured in videos produced by the Heritage Foundation promoting Project 2025.   Karoline Leavitt   Leavitt is Trumps’ pick for White House Press Secretary. She is his 2024 campaign’s national press secretary and served in the White House during his first term.   Leavitt is listed as one of Project 2025’s instructors who train conservatives on conservative governance best practices. The course she’s teaching is called The Art of Professionalism. She was featured in the Heritage Foundation’s videos promoting Project 2025.   Interestingly, she tried to distance Trump’s campaign from Project 2025 even though she’s a Project 2025 instructor as well as his campaign’s national press secretary.   Brendan Carr   Carr has been nominated to chair the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, and satellite. He currently serves as the senior Republican on FCC, having been appointed by Trump in 2017.  Carr authored a chapter “Federal Communications Commission” for Project 2025 and has proposed reigning in big tech and media companies that he claims have improperly “censored” conservatives’ views by limiting the reach of misinformation and lies.  Tom Homan, Border Czar   Homan has been appointed “border czar” who will oversee the southern and northern U.S. borders and all maritime and aviation security.  Homan served as the acting heading of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during Trump’s first administration. He retired in 2018 after the White House failed to move his nomination toward Senate confirmation. This time, Homan will bypass the process completely because his “border czar” role does not require Senate confirmation.   Homan is listed as an overall contributor of Project 2025.",rainbowshummingbird,2025-04-27T16:40:32,28

"Project 2025 was brought up many times during Trump’s campaign. He lied and said he didn’t know anything about it. The ill informed, undereducated voters were susceptible to his lies. Or maybe they knew he was lying and didn’t care.",rainbowshummingbird,2025-04-27T17:11:44,19
"The OG was written for a similarly age-addled Hollywood narcissist in the 80s. Project 2025 was the main title of this version, but the subtitle of Mandate for Leadership was the original version for Reagan.   [Here is Heritage, jerking itself off over it early 2000s.](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership)  This [Atlantic article from 2013 also gives a good glance at where they came from and where they were headed.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/09/the-fall-of-the-heritage-foundation-and-the-death-of-republican-ideas/279955/) While it sounded then like it was destroying itself and the party trying to energize a more self-destructive base, with one of the original founders saying it, “makes it look like just another hack Tea Party kind of group”, we get the unfortunate reality of a brighter future for Heritage...  >In his second term, Reagan turned again to Heritage for ideas-and adopted many of them. He recited 22 specific proposals from ""Mandate for Leadership II"" in his second inaugural address in 1985, prompting The New York Times to say, ""While the wording of the president's speech and the foundation's document were different, many of the proposals were strikingly similar.""
