"What else did she say? Here's something else she said this week, which didn't blow up...      “The way these detentions are taking place is reminiscent not of a nation of laws, but of authoritarian regimes. The Trump administration does not apply the law fairly, using the label of ‘criminals’ as a pretext to achieve its anti-immigration agenda.""",DonaldsMushroom,2025-05-01T20:44:49,2901

In 2009, Obama tried to remove a Fox News’ reporter from an interview on the basis that Fox “wasn’t news,” (Obama was right!)

"MTG was right about one thing. We are fundimentally a nation aching for a divorce with our polar oppsites who reside in this country. There's really no point ins saying much less besides telling them to ""fuck off"" at this point.  FFS there's a Trump supporter out there who had his wife held by ICE in cruel conditions needlessly for like 50 days and he STILL supports Trump and says his vote was fine. Trump could literally kidnap a Trump supporters wife  for weeks at a time and they would be fine with it.  The only conviction they have is praise Trump at all times. That is it. No matter what evidence, arguments, or obvious cruelties felt even personally they will praise Trump.  Just look at any interview with them when they are talking about their farm going belly up or whatever due to Trump. They have to hedge every lived experience with ""Well I still like the guy, not being political, he's doing what needs to be done."" even as their lives crash down around them.  Completely lost.  Its basically that new modern acceptance that sometimes its just better to cut people off for your own sanity.

"A very influential Reddit account that was one of the first to reach 1 million karma, has gone inactive since everything with Epstein happened, the account in question is called Maxwellhill  The Maxwell family is very well connected. One of Ghislaine’s sisters (Isabel, I think) is married to Roger Malina, son of Frank Malina. Frank was a pioneer of early rocketry, along with the other members of the “Suicide Squad” of Caltech grad school researchers. Another notable member was Jack Parsons, famed occultist.  Their research in the Arroyo Seco led to the creation of Jet Propulsion Laboratory, of which Frank Malina was the second director. JPL secured financial support from the U.S. Army in 1939 for the “GALCIT Rocket Project.” JPL would go on to demonstrate jet assisted takeoff (JATO). In 1943, the Aerojet corporation was formed to manufacture JATO rockets.  In 1944, Jack Parsons was dismissed from JPL and Aerojet for his involvement with occultism and dangerous work practices. In January-March of 1946, he and L Ron Hubbard (scientology founder) attempted a series of rituals in an attempt to manifest the incarnation of Thelemic goddess Babalon.  In 1951, after relocating to France, Malina was named head of scientific research for the fledgling United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) under its first director Julian Huxley (famous author Aldous’s brother).  After several joint projects throughout the 40s and 50s with the Army, including the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, JPL was absorbed into NASA in late 1958.  The history of rocketry is weird, and that’s without bringing up Werner von Braun; Ad Astra and x-metal; or that Frank Malina was indicted in 1952, declared a fugitive and to be arrested on return to the U.S.",AApplAApple,2025-05-02T14:35:17,0

Right now we live in a century of nationalism and revolution the way we channel these social forces matters. Once we arrive at a better footing after transforming and reforming the republic again and fixed a lot of the problems at the micro level (this is a cycle in American history we’ve seen play out) we can go back to a politics of o which is what I want. One of my favorite things time in politics is ironically the early 20th century, listening or reading to teddy roosevelts 90 minute speeches where he’d speak to a bunch of his supporters whether gun loving union members or just folks in the progressive movement articulating very complex ideas reasonably and patriotically for hours and people would listen and debate about it. You know how awesome that would be if we engaged in politics like that, we’d be able to tackle the issues of today. That is the kind of politics I’d want without the white supremacy, but to get to that we need to be very rational and understand the social forces that got us here. If we let Trump who is no aberration control us while ignoring these forces we miss the bigger picture. Right now the far left is ignoring the nationalism and the center left is either ignoring the economic insecurity while embracing the nationalism, or abandoning truth to appease mob mind of the side (fetterman).    Today, we just have slogans adhoms logical fallacies and mass stupidity where passion drowns reason. I kinda don’t wanna participate in that.",Ok-Land-6190,2025-05-01T23:11:56,2
"Well yes that's what heresay is. That wasn't the point. My point was, if you're going to have a stance you should have some kind of concrete evidence that isn't heresay preferably.  I never said I was the victim. What are you blabbing about?",FrizzBizz,2025-05-02T22:52:48,0
"Well, it’s  now “fuck off or die solution” - enjoy that while bashing the aim of a two state solution if that’s what you’re for I guess.",Dinker54,2025-05-02T16:08:26,1
"Because we can give you article after article and you'll claim its just heresay. Again, I'm never surprised how MAGA denies any reports of anything unsavory or disgusting about Trump, but y'all can hear anecdotal evidence of one single person or event, and claim its truth regardless of facts. Head in the sand friend.",RobienStPierre,2025-05-02T23:10:51,1
I think you’re due for a reread of what you’re commenting on. You’re quite literally doing this for me lmao but hey if you want to dog walk yourself until it clicks go right ahead .,Fabled-Okami,2025-05-02T16:25:27,0
"I don't need to claim the article is heresay. The article is heresay. Do you know what the definition of heresay is? I have said multiple times that I disagree with many things he has done in the past. He needs to shut his mouth. He needs to stop going after people with personal attacks. But that's just how he is. I can't stop that.  I promise you my friend, my head is not in the sand.",FrizzBizz,2025-05-03T00:14:41,1
"If only one of two people would have said he poops himself I would've laughed it off, but you take dozens of people saying it and well I'll accept it as likely but not proven. Yes by the technicality it's hearsay but then again we've all but seen the soiled diapers in question. Surely you've seen the weird bulging underpants that make his pants seem oddly shaped on him? Just saying it's not proven but it's pretty damn likely",RobienStPierre,2025-05-03T00:29:35,1
Kinda like how dozens of people said the covid vaccine was supposed to stop the spread immediately? People lie man. I hate to break it to you.  When did you see his soiled diaper? It's amazing to me that we are talking about soiled diapers. No I absolutely do not stare at people on the TV hoping to find proof of adult diapers being worn.,FrizzBizz,2025-05-03T00:48:44,1
