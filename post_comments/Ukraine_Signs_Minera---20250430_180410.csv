They could’ve negotiated something back when they held the most territory and the Russian army was on the ropes and they had the American government still backing them. Appeasement is a tough pill to swallow, but it would’ve been better for them than whatever this is going to be.  The lesson for the world to take away is this: Don’t trust America as your ally.

"Trump needs a ""win"" and a narrative to sell to Americans in order to boost his declining ratings. So Zelensky should take advantage of Trump's obsession with his public image and get some specific security guarantees out of the deal, in writing...  Trump has the gall to claim that this war would have never happened under his watch. Nevermind the fact that he likely helped accelerate the current iteration of this conflict in the first place, or that his strategy thus far has been to insult, extort and escalate tensions with our allies, but keep in mind that he failed to ""negotiate a peace"" during his first term while he was cozying up to Putin and while Russian sponsored forces were waging war inside of Ukraine's borders throughout the entirety of his presidency.  Not to mention how Trump aided Russian proxies in places like Syria after he abandoned the Kurds and let Putin take US outposts. I mean, there's a long, long list of past Trump policies, rhetoric and actions that illustrate pretty damn thoroughly just how conflicted and unfit he is for the role of peace-broker here.  In truth, he's likely more interested in earning the title of something like ""peacemaker,"" than he is in actually negotiating any sort of lasting peace.  That said, and Trump being Trump, I think it's clear at this point that his admin cannot be trusted to follow through on what amounts to a mere framework of a deal at the moment, let alone any security guarantees.  Even if this deal manages to take shape in the future, and both the US and Ukraine commit to reasonable terms, *and* there is some vested, US ""economic interest"" in Ukraine, Trump still can't be trusted to appropriately handle Russian aggression.  He also can't be trusted to uphold his end because he's an impulsive and vindictive narcissistic manchild whose attitudes towards others and his approach to foreign policy in particular can change on a whim.  The same way that Putin cannot be trusted to hold up his end of the bargain because he's violated practically every agreement since he came into power.  Not to mention Putin's imperialist, land grabbing ambitions rooted in a revisionist historical idea that Russia is destined for greatness and reincorporation (reclamation of its territory), and is fated to become a dominant world superpower. This is one reason why Trump seeks to emulate Putin, why he legitimizes dictatorship and has glorified him in the past. But it's also why this war is *never* over for Putin. There is no end to his ""special military operation.""  There may be a temporary pause in the conflict at some point, but any overture of peace from Putin will amount to a strategic move meant to give him some time to recoup and reorganize his forces, only to later resume his expansionist campaign against Ukraine and any neighbors that once sat on the peripheries of the Russian empire. While keep in mind, Putin is also determined to expand Russia's oil operation, which is just another reason why he's resolved to not end this war until he's satisfied with the outcome.  And don't forget that this all comes as the Trump administration has been floating a ""take it or leave it"" deal that concedes to nearly every one of Putin's demands... Including the annexation of almost 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, and territory that is rich in these mineral resources no less.   How can you take the Trump administration seriously when this recent deal also forces Ukraine to relinquish any territory it's gained while still allowing Russian forces to remain deep within Ukraine's borders. A deal that provides no specific security guarantees for Ukraine, that demands Ukraine end all notions of joining or cooperating with NATO, a deal that is contingent upon Ukraine formally recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea, a deal that does not honor past agreements, and certainly doesn't respect Ukraine's right to self determination.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-30T22:30:57,1

Dudayev was assassinated by Russia in 1996.  >""The Russia leadership, throughout its history has always fled to sign agreements whenever it was in trouble, agreements that Russia has never respected, will not respect, and does not intend to respect. As soon as it regains strength it begins again - isolate the weakest and starts tormenting them.   >This is Russia - an empire of evil, and empire of evil as it was, is, and remains. It demonstrated its predatory, greed, ruthlessness, lack of spirituality, and immorality in Chechnya. 250,000 troops, 5,600 pieces of armored equipment, an unprecedented number in history against a handful of people and a territory so small it requires a microscope to find it on the map. They attacked, pacifying the international community by declaring through the russian president that there would be no military solution, only a peaceful one. And then, on New Year's Eve, on New Year's Eve they mixed sand, earth, sky,blood, and human flesh into a bloody mess.  >They have no intention of deviating from this policy, they have no intention. This is what Russia is.

We just let the Israelis fight, just as we said ""no"" when they were bombed without provocation in Biden's time, but they finally went out anyway and destroyed the head of Hezbollah. And the Israelis don't want another attack to happen again, so they're basically killing the bully Hamas so all the other bullies won't attack - which is a tactic. But we could have spared many of the Palestinians had we done it - gone in, gotten the Israeli hostages and arrested the Hamas - and we never have.   But the US public ?

No what's happened is the Overton Window has been shifted insanely far right after Bill Clinton moved right to attempt to capture moderate votes.  Republicans responded by going hard right with the tea party and even harder right with maga.  Did you know we would save trillions of dollars by having a single payer health care system instead of private insurance?  Meanwhile republicans have successfully demonized this and people ignore that crippling medical debt is one of the most common sources of bankruptcy in the country.  The trump tax cut that is currently being pushed is almost entirely focused on people making over 700k yearly and corporations and will cost the us tax payer 4 TRILLION dollars.  Let's not even talk about the fact that tariffs are in all reality a regressive tax.  A regressive tax is a tax that disproportionately effects those of lower incomes.   Tariffs are essentially a flat add onto prices which will have significantly more effect on those who have less money.    This is why income tax is a very good thing because it is set up as a progressive tax meaning those who can't afford it pay less and those who have largely built empires on the backs of others pay more; however there are so many holes in the tax code that the richest often end up paying less of their wealth proportionately than the poorest.  We have gone from CEOs being at a 17:1 ratio in salary with the common worker to 300:1 we should be going back to the Eisenhower tax brackets instead we are cutting taxes even more on those who already have more money than they could spend in 10 lifetimes.,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-30T20:36:33,2

">All trump did was say that wars of aggression and expansion are ok  In 2014, when Russia took Crimea, Obama made a phone call to tell Putin he was ""deeply concerned."" (Seriously, look it up.) That was his method of dealing with Putin's taking Crimea.  In 2022, when Putin went in and started killing, Biden didn't deal with Putin at all - just gave enough weapons to draw out the war and have more people killed on both sides.  Trump now has the responsibility because Biden's admin didn't either war or broker peace. When he tried to get Zelensky to make a deal earlier, they were in a better position, and had more land, which they have now lost to Russia. And Ukraine is losing.   Trump will remember being under desks during the Cold War, with bomb drills. Trump will remember the USSR, when Russia had control of countries then not, and there was war after war after war with all the little countries fighting for independence - and the US didn't do anything there but wave their big nukes. So I would guess he's now trying not to cause a world war right now, where will we fight Russia, China, and North Korea, and we are the only ones adequately armed to do so - but not to fight all of them without help.  **Europe has not gotten its defense together.** Trump 1 badgered half of the NATO countries to arm up to the 2% GDP NATO levels and pay for half of Ukraine, though it's a loan. But not all countries have gotten to 2% - and 2% is not enough for a war. The US was up to 25% GDP defense during the last year of WWII. The US is okay - at 7% or 13 - whatever figure is right. And we've learned from the war with drones bc of Ukraine. But not all of the allies are armed up. If we go in, we go in at a disadvantage, and it will be WWIII. We would have to give Europe more time.   Would you also like to go into all the wars - would you like to go in against the Hamas as well? Ukraine isn't or didn't agree to be a member of NATO - if it was one of the 20? NATO countries, we would have warred.   Russia could continue and take the rest of Ukraine. It's why the US has to make so many concessions personally. Ukraine is at a disadvantage. Russia isn't keeping all they gained, but they had Crimea earlier. The US is also making itself vulnerable by putting US operations in place in Ukraine - and giving it a good portion of our funds now and earlier.

"Okay! Thanks for your good response - I have questions about taxes, and I do think progressive = Obama.  But Trump's a Jacksonian Democrat. It baffles me when he's called a fascist (should be neofascist after 1945) because the Wiki on Jacksonian fits him perfectly. The [Wall Street Journal had an essay](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trumps-jacksonian-revolt-1478886196) on this as well. I think he's also a big cheese, and that gets him into trouble. You know?  Obama had a similar presence but was much more progressive than we knew - Thomas Sowell said we didn't know what we were getting beyond the silver tongue. I think the benefit of Trump is you know more of what you're getting. Sowell didn't like Trump either at first but said the results didn't lie - 2018 the economy was at a high.  Have you read about Obama? He was considered the most liberal member of Congress in 2008 and called himself a liberal or progressive. He started the executive orders, which hadn't been a thing (since FDR? history fails me), and the Republicans just did not know what to do since he had the full majority (as Trump does). (They didn't wave signs or protest because they were more Presbyterian Republicans.) He promoted environmental initiatives. Obamacare was half assed - we needed to go all in or not at all. I think he thought we'd be forced to go all in. What's always held us back is that we're innovators in healthcare, and a lot of that is driven by the private sector. Canadians and others would come down here to seek care because their public healthcare wasn't good. If they had a lot of money, they could hire a concierge - and that's the danger - that divide of good care for the rich, not good care for the rest of us. I think the better choice would have been vouchers from the govt without making care part of the budget. If you are sick, BCBS still needs to take you, even at exorbitant monthly fees, which the govt should help pay for. Anyway, we went from debt as 55% of GDP to 95% of GDP. Somehow, we also became more divided under Obama than under anyone else. Maybe a dem for the first time in years? Maybe executive orders? He also removed the rule behind the Fairness Doctrine, so media could go as far left and agenda as it wanted. And we somehow further lost our middle class under Obama. [Economist Thomas Sowell said he was our worst president.](https://youtu.be/IzIJJ_MyzXI?feature=shared&t=96). From 1:35 on (I think in 2011 - he later calls him a narcissist.) ""The America that has flourished for two centuries is being quietly but steadily dismantled by the Obama administration."" - Sowell. He talks about world vs country. Are we citizens of the world or of the country?  The Trump tax cuts from Trump 1 helped the economy tremendously - cuts do. Taxes don't. But we need to pay the debt - printing money and raising inflation is a kind of tax because we no longer have the same amount we've saved, at least not in practical use terms. Re better economy (from TownHall.org):  > On election day, 2016 (11-8-16), the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 18,332.74. On (8-21-20) it stands at 27,898.82, which is an increase of 52% in 3.5 years, even including several months of the coronavirus epidemic.   The tariffs are a leveraging tool and should stay that way. They rile up and make people mad enough to invest in their defense (Canada, Europe) a type of trolling as the one that caused Denmark to finally pay a billion to fortify Greenland. Ultimately, wait and see how things play out. He wanted more leverage, and he got it through the tariffs. He also sectioned off China with the use of dealing with countries all around them - countries who were mad at the practices and unfair trade of China. In the end, I would guess we will not have as many tariffs for us or them, and we'll have a freer trade economy, with fewer strictures on our goods - we'll see in 60 days.  Income tax on businesses and corporations just make them want to make things elsewhere and scoot the money they create away from the country. Income tax on the very rich does something less awful but similarly, they know how to scoot their money away. The holes in the tax code, as you say, create this imbalance. That's why Forbes wanted a flat tax with a ceiling of X dollars earned, then the rest taxed at one rate.

Crimea was Russia's to begin with - I mean, it was other people's then Russia's. Then Ukraine's in 1956.  The U.S. entered WWII only after much prodding - Roosevelt let Pearl Harbor happen because he wanted to be involved, but they would have won without us. For WWI, we did go in to save the day - and save Europe's sorry butt monetarily and then with soldiers - so I think that's our input. That's where our success ended. For Korea - well, we have South Korea. For Vietnam - no - at least we weren't there all 10 years.

I do agree they should have shoved single payer down their throat when they had full control so many issues would be fixed by that.  Since you referenced Sowell as an authority figure here is how he feels as far as the Trump Tariffs go  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9LYO_qFLeE  He considers them a ruinous decision that will set off a world wide trade war similar to what preceded the great depression.  If companies flee to avoid income taxes then you significantly tax their final product for it.  That is one case that specifically applied tariffs can be used in a competent fashion.  Not exactly the same situation but Harley Davidson was on the brink of complete destruction when Honda first started significant importing of bikes to the US.  Tariffs were applied in a protectionist nature until Harley could reduce their cost of production.  They weren't blanket applied.  Nearly every other first world country has significantly higher tax rates on billionaires and coorporations.  If they want to live and sell in the US they can pay their fair share or leave we should not be cutting medicare or medicaid or straight up stealing from social security to pay for tax cuts for people who have more money than they could spend in 10 lifetimes.  Social Security is essentially a forced retirement account that we pay into the entire reason that it is in a worrying situation was due to capping how much of income would be applied to it.  If the cap wasn't there it would be zero issue.  If social security is cut they are literally stealing your money  I suggest you read up about someone called Curtis Yarvin he was a guest at Trump's inauguration celebration and has been referred to in a rather glowing endorsement by Vance.  He is also Peter Thiel's ""house philosopher"".  A lot of his ideas specifically about accelerationism and network states are what is driving many of this regime's economic choices.     If you want to talk about not raising taxes by the way illegal aliens provide 90 billion in taxes yearly that they will never receive anything from.
