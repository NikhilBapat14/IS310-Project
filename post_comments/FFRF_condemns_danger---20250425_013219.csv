"This is just getting absurd.  Just have to say, after 15 years of Catholic education, where I read the Bible cover to cover, the Quran, and enjoyed studying the history and religious texts of various world religions, it becomes overly apparent to anyone taking the time and effort to study religions that all religions are bullshit. Sorry for being blunt here.  Christianity is no more than a collection of largely fictitious stories (often stolen from prior religions) and moral parables passed down by largely illiterate desert-wandering nomadic goat herders who were trying to make sense of a world they did not and could not understand, and comfort their people with an aligned purpose. Religion is derived out of fear and ignorance, which at one time served an arguably helpful purposes, but now is just archaic and largely detrimental.  There have been thousands of major deities just in recorded human history alone, literally millions of minor deities. Yet 99.99% of all humans who have ever lived will believe in the religion and god(s) their parents did, and their parents before them. Dictated solely by the given culture, geographical region, and historical time in which they were born. You didn't *choose* your religion, your religion isn't ""right"" because you believe it and your parents told you so from a young age, you were indoctrinated.  A famous quote by Stephen Robert's: *""I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.""*  To still believe in a god, especially under a modern structuralized religion, in this day in age is baffling, and shows a deep ignorance of the world, science, and the history of your own faiths (as well as all other faiths). But generally held if it brings people comfort and they use it for good, usually fine. Maybe.  But what I cannot stand is those like the GOP (or really all governments to varying degrees since the dawn of civilization) who do not live by their faith's moral teachings, and instead seek to weaponize religion and people's faiths born out of fear in order to control and manipulate the masses for profit.  F-ck Trump, and F-ck the GOP.",IsThatHearsay,2025-04-25T01:54:01,45
"Jesus literally said if you don't love people, help the poor, feed the hungry, shelter the homeless, etc, you're going to Hell because he literally said ""if you don't do this to the least of these, you didn't do it to me"".  ""What would Jesus do"" should be inscribed in all of the hearts of ""Christians"". My only solace is that they actually go to hell for being so willfully the same hypocrites that Jesus and other christian prophets rebuked thousands of years ago.

"> But what I cannot stand is those like the GOP (or really all governments to varying degrees since the dawn of civilization) who do not live by their faith's moral teachings  That's the thing though: they do. As you note, people create their own gods in their own image. Religion exists to give comforting answers that align with people's wishes and worldview.  It's the same with these people. They are reactionary, authoritarian and hostile to everyone they see as different. They tie morality to identity, i.e. you are good or bad according to who you are (or their perception of who you are), not according to what you say or do. This is quite a challenging proposition given that most people have some capacity for empathy and don't like harming others. Therefore, they require a justification, a rationalization, for what they do and say.  So they create a god and a religion that reflects that, which then justifies their immoral behaviour. They piggy back on an existing religion not because they like the traditional interpretation and moral framework, but because they identify with the brand. You can argue they use the same label but actually believe in a different faith, but I'm not sure this fundamentally matters, as they do believe. They have to, because if they don't then they are no longer god's chosen but just regular human beings making choices, having to assume moral responsibility for those choices.  Fundamentally, the problem is that religion has nothing to contribute to a reasonable discussion about morality in the same way it has nothing to contribute to one about the natural world. Religion answers questions about the natural world through myth making. Those have been thoroughly debunked, to the point where it is impossible to take them serious any more even as a believer. However, you see the same problem with morality. Since they assume the source of morality is not the human experience but divine authority, every moral question inevitably becomes a tautology (""this is good or bad because god wants this or said that""). This means bad people have a very easy time justifying their actions with religion, because god does not exist and therefore doesn't speak, so they can just assume religious authority,  avoid all those nasty moral qualms and thorny questions and do what they wanted to do anyway.",barryvm,2025-04-25T03:55:54,4

"There being many beliefs across the world doesnt make lower the possibility of them being true. Quantity doesnt really matter as much as how cohesive it all is/ how much it aligns with reality.

"I mean I would argue that the reality is as the comment before stated, that you’re significantly more likely to be a part of the religion that is popular in the area you are raised in/what religion your parents follow. If your parents are Christian, they’re not going to randomly raise their kid to be Buddhist or Muslim, because that’s simply not what they believe in. Same in vice versa.   My parents weren’t/aren’t very religious, but I was still sent to CCD and went to church as a kid because my grandparents are religious. When I decided it wasn’t for me, they didn’t give me any pushback they just let me do my own thing but that’s not always the case.   To say Christianity is *the* religion doesn’t really make sense to me personally, because there is just as much evidence to suggest that many other religions are rooted in real historical figures as well. Even that isn’t enough to convince me, though that’s not to say I don’t believe in spirituality, to me god is math. Would you mind if I asked your reasoning as to why Christianity is the true religion?",HeadfulOfSugar,2025-04-25T13:54:25,2
