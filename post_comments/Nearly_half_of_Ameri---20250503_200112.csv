"There's this famous SF short story by Terry Bisson called ""They're Made of Meat"". It's just a dialogue between two unidentified aliens (when it was adapted as a stage play they were represented by two different colored lights that change color and intensity to represent speech and emotion) who pick up television signals from Earth and are tasked with determining whether or not the rest of the universe should reach out to humanity. But the whole narrative is based around one alien trying to explain to its colleague that humans are made of meat, and the colleague is so horrified that they can't even comprehend the concept:  >Â ""We're supposed to talk to meat?""  >""That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing.""  >Â Â ""They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?""  >""Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.""  >Â Â ""I thought you just told me they used radio.""  >""They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat.""  >Â Â ""Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?""  In the end, it's determined that the very notion of humanity is far too grotesque and disturbing for the rest of the universe to handle, so the Milky Way is declared off limits.  That's how I imagine aliens would react if they took one look at humanity. Not necessarily because we're made out of meat more because everything about us.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-05-03T21:04:22,5

"They probably are hiding various secrets that you might call related to UFOs, for various reasons: the existence of test aircraft or drone operations, not wanting to reveal our intelligence capabilities related to certain footage, and other military/intelligence secrets. I don't suspect any of that has to do with alien crafts, faster than light travel, anti-gravity airships, or the like.",enjoycarrots,2025-05-03T20:15:24,7

"This is just my opinion.... But I'm rather certain there is life out there....likely there is a lot of it. The mathematics point to this being a near certainty.  However, the universe is so vast that the vast majority of these civilizations are way too far apart to ever be able to meet. Unless one of these civilizations has developed a way to traverse vast distances of BOTH space and time, the worlds are extinct far before the civilization will ever meet anyone else.  So if we are being visited, I doubt it is in the traditional sense where these beings are just flying through space and happen to find us while flying by. It's more likely they've found some way to manipulate time or have become cross-dimensional. Either way, they would need to be extremely intelligent, and far superior technology than we have even imagined possible.",InsideAside885,2025-05-03T22:08:40,2

"For the love of fucking God, aliens likely due, according to mathematical probability, exist, but are likely in the same boat as we are and can't get to us. Even if they are here, they are likely advanced enough to observe us and not interfere in our existence, with it highly unlikely they would be caught doing it. They could easily learn anything about us through the existence of our wireless communications and our internet that they probably could easily access to the point they wouldn't have to abduct humans to begin with let alone bring a craft low enough to be seen.   Stop worrying about the supposed malevolent aliens that you think is flying in the sky and worry more about the malevolent humans who are actively fucking you over.",Shiplord13,2025-05-03T21:49:30,2

"I think it's blind arrogance to assume our understanding of the universe is so complete, when we can't even reconcile gravity and QM, that we can conclusively say even societies with millions, perhaps billions, of years of technological progress beyond our own could never even possibly develop a means of either effective FTL or merging with machines or synthetic genetics in such a way that it's effective immortality, so trips of millenia are possible.  We study ants and bacteria.  But I do agree with ""obviously not"" for another reason; the dementia addled orange shitgibbon would have spilled the beans. You'd hope the 'adults in the room' would keep our biggest secrets away from the Russian asset, but they gave him high level nuclear weapons info and a list of spies and HUMINT sources to sell.",fafalone,2025-05-04T02:16:21,2
