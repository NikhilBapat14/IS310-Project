They want to scare you into compliance. They want you to believe that if you don't shut up and keep your head down it could be you. Especially if you're a person of color.   Here's our leaders rallying against this bullshit out in the open. No masks. No fear. Big middle finger to Trump, and more importantly, a big middle finger to these scare tactics.

Obstruct every single thing. Deny unanimous consent for all votes. That alone stalls things. Go to El Salvador like van hollen. Spend as much time in debate as possible.
