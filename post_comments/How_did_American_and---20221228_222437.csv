"Okay so I feel like I'm pretty qualified to answer all this. I am Canadian, I've worked in parliament, and I studied both political science and history. Finally, my time has come.   Americans think Canada is some magical place a lot of the time. That's obviously not true, but not a ton of Canadian news filters down to Americans so the image sticks. We are absolutely more authoritarian than the United States and always have been. Where people get confused is that it's also a lot more left wing than the US.   For example. The father of the current prime minister, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, once called the job of the prime minister: ""a dictator with a smile"". In reference to the fact that there are precious few checks on the PM's powers. You may not think of the office of the President as being constrained by the legislature and courts, but compared to Canada, it is absolutely kneecapped. Part of this is due to the fact that there is no office of the Prime Minister in the same way that there is an Office of the President. The Prime Minister is both the PM and the leader of his party in the legislature. This means that if he wants a bill passed, he gets his party to pass it exactly as he likes. The reason that matters is because if he is the Prime Minister, it also means his party has a majority government in the House, and will be able to pass the bill without problems. (Not dealing with the exceptions for now). There is no seperate election for Prime Minister. The guy with all the power in the legislature gets all the power in the Executive, all of the time. Our Senate is just a rubber stamping machine because they're appointed by the Prime Minister.   The provinces do have some power over the Federal government, but the federal government has pretty reliable ways around those divisions of powers if they need to. For example, any time a province moves towards restricting abortion, the feds can pull the 1/3 of healthcare funding that comes from the federal government. Considering healthcare is usually the #1 expenditure from provincial governments already, it's an extremely effective threat. So despite the fact that on paper, healthcare is a provincial matter, it's all kept on the straight and narrow by the feds.   Another example, the recent trucker's protests. The federal government was fed up that the provinces weren't acting so they (among other things) nationalized the police force.   The USA doesn't have a lot of that, and the list keeps going. I know it's trendy to say the US is authoritarian, and maybe it's even trending that way, idk. But you guys are coming from a place of a much deeper rooted sense of individual freedom and autonomy than Canada does historically.   I mean, until 1982, we literally didn't have a supreme court, it was still a court in Britain. And even then, out supreme court is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and we aren't even required to have hearings like you do in the US. The US system isn't exactly good by any means, but that's still leaps and bounds more accountability than Canada's system.   Yeah, we have healthcare and a stronger social safety net and generally more social programs. But don't confuse a left/right axis with an authoritarian axis, as much as I hate the political compass. Canada is a much more centralized government system than the United States, and it's not close.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-12-29T10:44:46,16
>how did their governments differ?  The Canadian government uses an adapted version of the British parliamentary system since the country didn't fully leave the British Empire till about 1982 and a lot of the intertwined legal systems needed to cooperate.   >what was America's government considered in 1867?   It was largely the same as it was now just structured differently than the British system.  >wouldn't it be considered the same back in 1867?  Keep in mind that 1867 is two years after the American civil war has ended and only 55 years after the war of 1812. The Governor General has seen British North America invaded during his lifetime and has served in office during a period where the United States was attempting to tear itself to pieces over the expansion of an institution that has been outlawed for quite some time in the British Empire.,ProMarshmallo,2022-12-29T10:36:03,4
In 1867 the US is 2 years into the Reconstruction era following the end of the Civil War. During this period the US Army occupied and governed 10 of the former Confederate States under martial law.,Skweege55,2022-12-29T14:56:06,2
"The parliament is different. Only house is elected, senate is appointed. King Charles is the current head of state, but the prime minister is head of government (minor powers to the crown). Pm can dissolve parliament. There are coalitions vs two parry control.   Rights are different. Canada doesn't have 1a. View on speech is very different, no 2a either.   I mean entire books can be written on the differences, most are things people don't think about because day to day life is similar, but the actual functioning of government is very different.",Carbon_Gelatin,2022-12-29T09:29:21,4
"In Canada we don't specifically vote for our leader, in America your vote for your presidential choice on your ballot.   When election time rolls around in Canada, I go to vote for my local MP (Member of Parliament). They could be any one of a dozen parties, but the 2 most dominant are Conservative or Liberal parties.   The Prime minister is then decided by which party gets more seats,  if the party gets over 50% of the 338 seats in parliament, then they have a majority government, if they receive less then 50%, they will still be the party in control, but will need to with with other minority governments to get work done.  The Prime minister is the head of Government, and our official government representative on the world stage. But as others have mentioned, the official head of Canada is the current King. Though they don't really affect anything to do with the way live our lives generally speaking.   This same system of governing is also applied at our provincial (think of your State) elections.  Instead of a constitution like you have, we have our Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that outlined functions and protections of the government and it's people. In some regards we have less freedoms (no specific gun protections) and in some other aspects we might have more freedoms depending on the perspectives of the reader.",workguy,2022-12-29T10:02:14,3

"I’m not an expert by any means, but I imagine back then the idea of representative vs direct democracy were more clearly stark between the Canada and the US, respectively.   A lot of people don’t realize just how much you vote for in the US, it ranges from the president to prosecutors and police officials, to your local pest control guy.  This is a lot more direct democracy than Canada has ever had or currently has and I imagine that difference was even starker back then.   Representative democracy as a model focusses less on direct people power and more on the idea that every region should send a local leader they trust to make decisions on their behalf, for example the appointment of judges and the pest control guy. This arose in Britain because parliaments used to be called sporadically with a set of issues that they were all gathered to debate and vote on, so you would send your representative to make those decisions for your area.  They didn’t sit all the time as they do now and the freedom of the elected representatives to disagree with their own constituents is still something that’s baked into the system.  A canadian of the time who is very pro the Canadian system would probably argue that direct democracy leads to tyranny and violence because it allows populist whims to dictate policy instead of people whose job is to spend all their time thinking about this stuff.",[deleted],2022-12-29T17:45:27,1
"I’m not sure I agree that authoritarian is the right word to use to describe modern Canada, or parliamentary systems in general.  The US has extremely authoritarian tendencies when it comes to national security and policing - during the war on drugs the DEA could and would repossess your house if you were *charged* with a crime, not convicted.  The power of the US state when turned against its citizens is within specific limits, but those limits have been proven time and time again to be *very* wide and highly resistant to public opinion.   If anything I’d say that parliamentary systems in recent years have proven themselves to be far more resistant to authoritarians than for example the US.  The PM is the head of the executive but they also serve at the pleasure of parliament and don’t have any mandate that’s separate from elected representatives.    Authoritarian leaders are usually presidents and not Prime Ministers because having a separate office and therefore a separate mandate allows for the exercising of one man rule without consulting your legislature. Justin Trudeau has no powers that the legislature cannot take away by simply passing a vote of no confidence.  We saw this with Boris Johnson in the UK.  His instincts were absolutely Trumpian and in the US he could have behaved like a demagogue, but he was removed from power comparatively extremely easily.   Imo, though systems like Canada, Denmark etc hand far more power to the PM as an individual, the hold on power is significantly more tenuous and therefore a lot more responsive to the demands of the electorate and MPs.  I personally think our system works better because it’s comparatively very flexible.  The US is currently suffocating under the number of outdated rules it’s bound by that are hard to get rid of, like the electoral college, an over-powerful senate, electing heavily politicized judges, etc.",[deleted],2022-12-29T17:22:34,8

"We literally have Justin Trudeau and the Liberal party my dude. Canadian jokes aside, they put an excellent spin on things, but the fact is it's a very corporatist party. I would even go so far as to say more corporatist than the Republicans.   You have to understand that Canada is very small in a lot of ways. We live next to the USA so if we don't support domestic industries, they're packing up and crossing the border eventually. That means that there is an absolute ton of cronyism with regards to big Canadian firms and the government.   SNC Lavalin, Irving shipbuilding, the entire dairy industry. All protected by an army of politicians willing to fight to the death, NAFTA or any other trade agreements be damned.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-12-29T10:26:25,3
"I don’t know man, Trudeau is one of the most power hungry people I’ve seen run a western country and he’s blatantly obvious about it.
