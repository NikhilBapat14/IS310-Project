It’s time Greenland and Denmark tell the US military to get out of Greenland and then Denmark station its own troops at the now empty American bases in Greenland. If nothing is done to stop the mango Mussolini he will go after Greenland then Canada and Panama and who knows where he’ll stop,CAM6913,2025-05-07T14:14:41,16

"The problem is the office of the president actually has the authority to put military personnel anywhere in the world. It’s why the War Powers Act of 1973 was passed, but it only prescribes minor limits on timing as it relates to funding.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-07T13:19:17,5
"While it may be a distraction, it doesn’t feel that way to the people that live there.   I’m all for dismissing his weird shit posting and AI images, but annexation threats need to be taken seriously.",waterw1ngs,2025-05-07T13:08:02,20
