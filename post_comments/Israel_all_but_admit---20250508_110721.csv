Israel needs it''s  Lebensraum    Time to shun this violent terror state,aBoyNamedWho,2025-05-08T11:24:16,12
"No, Trump confirmed it with the romantic AI video he posted of he and his Israeli husband on a fantasy resort beach.   Trump has stated both he and Netanyahu’s goal are to ethnically cleanse, and then displace the leftover population.   The admitted desire and plan is to displace citizens, in pursuit of building a resort, stealing the land from Palestinians, and giving it to America, or putting it under the security of the American military.  Along with stopping all essential goods that are needed to survive.",DrFarfetsch,2025-05-08T12:24:45,6
"This is, of course, preferable by Gazans... compared to HAMAS surrendering.  It seems like we're going to see every single Gazan choose death or expulsion rather than choosing to stop trying to kill Jews. Which is a completely batshit-insane level of radicalization.  Thanks, UNRWA!",Joadzilla,2025-05-08T12:41:55,-18
What is this “third-way” you are imagining?   That the Netenyahu government would offer to let Gazans keep their territory and have the full gamut of human rights if they agreed to let the PLO control Gaza?  Or if they had new elections and voted out Hamas? Then they could keep their land and have human rights?  You’re saying that if they elected a political party other than Hamas that they could have a good life.  But is anyone else saying that? Has Netanyahu presented them with that option? (And would he promise to honor that bargain if Gazans took it)?,-Gramsci-,2025-05-08T14:46:09,6
"Even you can't see the alternative.  Surrender. Unconditional surrender.  And compared to surrendering, the Gazans seem to prefer death or expulsion. Which means they are further radicalized than the imperial Japanese in the last months of WWII.  \---  Thanks, UNRWA.",Joadzilla,2025-05-08T15:03:14,-3
How would surrendering produce a different outcome?   There would have to be an incentive to doing that.   Which you would never provide. It’s expulsion/ethnic cleansing either way. Can you blame them for not helping you to do that?,-Gramsci-,2025-05-08T15:21:40,5
"Surrendering means that the war is over.  Which means that any military forces in the area are now recognized, by Israel, as an occupation force. And that forces Israel to provide food, shelter, and medical supplies to the civilians.  Right now, all HAMAS does by not surrendering... is give Israel a fig-leaf to say that they don't control Gaza. And that because it's HAMAS-controlled territory, it's HAMAS's responsibility to provide for the Gazans.  When HAMAS surrenders, they formally levy that responsibility to the Israeli government. And there's no more fig-leaf.",Joadzilla,2025-05-08T15:32:29,-1
"Now that I will grant you. At that point the Geneva Conventions and any rules regarding occupying military forces would apply.   But you are relying on Gazans being able to appeal to the ICC to enforce those rules.   Which Israel will not recognize, appear before, or adhere to orders from.   So you’re back to square one, in that you’d be asking Gazans to assist in their own ethnic cleansing.  For your plan to work in providing an incentive… the surrender could NOT be unconditional. It would need to be conditioned upon Israel’s promise to strictly adhere to international law regarding the treatment of Gazans and Gaza itself.   THEN there’d be a reason to surrender.",-Gramsci-,2025-05-08T15:39:32,3
