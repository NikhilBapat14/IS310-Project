"Yes, but he's doing it without acting like a shrinking coward.   Being good at politics involves projecting strength even when you are in a weak position. People will go along with what the big dominant ape seems to want. It's how humans are wired.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-08T11:55:32,4
"What other power does he really have to do anything about it? What exactly do you want him to do? Start a war with the federal government? Succeed from the Union?   I’m not sure what you realistically expect him to do to do beyond what he is already trying to do right now.   He’s doing all he can without overtly breaking laws and degrading the rule of law even further. And even better, he is actively assisting efforts to preserve and protect the law as an institution.   So… where’s the rub? You just want to throw out the whole Democratic Party now? And take away the only thing standing in the right’s way? That’s an unbearably naive take, no offense. Throwing out the baby with the bath water is not going to fix this. It might help create a society you personally think will be better, eventually. Sure. But it’s almost certain to make things a lot worse before that happens, and frankly, it’s extremely likely to fail in getting you all that you want.   Who do you think is helping to launch all these lawsuits around the country that have allowed judges to hear cases and rule against what this admin is doing, anyways? Fucking Gandhi?   It’s the democratic governors and AG’s, in no small part. They are already doing much more than a lot of democrats in Washington, arguably. Lumping them in all together as a monolith and not looking for any nuance whatsoever is just regressive thinking. It doesn’t help anyone, save for people on the fringes who want to tear it all down anyways (on both sides), perhaps.   I want to fix the Democratic Party too, but this is not how we do that. This is how we lose, to keep it simple. It is not a winning message and it never will be, regardless of why you said it or what the intent was.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-09T02:29:57,1

"> Patriotism means to stand by the country. It does not mean to stand by the President or any other public official save exactly to the degree in which he himself stands by the country. It is patriotic to support him in so far as he efficiently serves the country.

"Right. He’s one of those guys, if I recall correctly, who’s like “yeah, tax me more”. He’s going to continue making his money, and potentially doing some good, but recognizes there has to be some semblance of balance. Doing the right thing isn’t going to stop him from making a lot of money. He just won’t be making a _super duper_ lot of money (but already has more than he can spend in several lifetimes over and probably recognizes it).   Hell, I’m nowhere near that guy’s financial status, but i do quite well. Not “fuck you” money by any means, and I don’t have enough to start some meaningful foundation or charity or even do anything to put a dent in someone else’s life, _and even I think I should be taxed more_.  The problem isn’t taxes. It’s the allocation of them and making sure they are spent on worthwhile things. A rising tide lifts all boats. And while I know there’s corruption in how some of my taxes are spent, I do t want to throw the baby out with the bath water and get rid of taxes altogether (that would be dumb). I’d rather focus on how we can fix that problem and make sure there’s an accurate accounting.",idontknowwhynot,2025-05-08T16:07:41,5

"> Not sure if she could get elected though.  She has no chance in a Democratic primary so long as she's just a congresswoman.  For rank and file Democrats, they get behind a candidate because they think they can win the general. And pretty much a mandatory test of candidate credibility with that is to have won at at least the statewide level.  Beat Schumer and become Senator Ocasio-Cortez (D)-NY? Very good shot of winning the primary if not at least final two. But as only a congresswoman? She'd be a long shot who would probably be eliminated before Super Tuesday.",IRSunny,2025-05-08T15:52:49,1

She wasn't likeable, she seemed ""out of touch"", are we forgetting about the ""Pokemon Go to the Polls"" quip? We can argue day and night on if she'd've been better than Trump, obviously she would've been. But the election on its face is a popularity contest and she just wasn't it.  Kamala Harris: at a time where people wanted something to change about the status quo, she goes on national TV and says nothing would fundamentally change. That was **the moment** she lost the election. Trump was change. Bad change, but still change.",LuitenantDan,2025-05-08T16:27:54,1
"Or encourage the populace to develop nuance so as to be more media literate. Once you move past the banal rhetoric regarding wedge issues, you can get people to focus on collective benefits instead of trivial issues that benefit everyone.

"Progressive policies are popular in isolation, but somehow not as a package. I think most people have some progressive policies they really like and some they really hate.

I think this is confusing people's agreeableness for politics. Most people want to find common ground and have a pleasant social experience. Doesn't mean they will vote that way.

I'm sure that this is subconscious sexism.
