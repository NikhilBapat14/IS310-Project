"Silly question - whatever is made into law is legal, just like the ability of banks to operate like unregulated casinos betting other people's money. Only difference is with this change, the 90% would be protected against the machinations of the 1% instead of being staked out as easy prey.  We need a sales tax on all stock transactions. It would put an end to the computer high speed trading that makes a mockery of the whole reason we created Corporations and stock exchanges in the first place - to raise capital for economic expansion that would benefit all the people...eventually. Then we need to end the ""step-up"" valuation of inherited assets and tax the gains from purchase to point the asset's ownership is transferred to slow the transition of our society into two classes - an aristocracy of great inherited (unearned) wealth and a serfdom of everybody else.",Olderscout77,2023-03-22T08:50:57,1
