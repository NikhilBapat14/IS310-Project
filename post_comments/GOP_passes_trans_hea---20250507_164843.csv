"Please, republicans. Tell me how this isn't about just increasing suicide and mental health problems in already vulnerable communities. Just like removing LGBTQ resources, even free or low/non-funded ones (like informational websites or low-cost hotlines) is directly targeting vulnerable communities. There's not even a financial/real political reason besides wanting trans people to die to pass this.",Purusha120,2025-05-07T17:53:15,21
Fuck the GOP.  Honest to god with these hateful assholes,SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-07T17:14:48,24
">In reality, every major American medical association and leading world health authority has [endorsed gender-affirming care](https://glaad.org/medical-association-statements-supporting-trans-youth-healthcare-and-against-discriminatory/) as evidence-based, safe, and in some cases lifesaving for transgender youth. Numerous studies have shown that a lack of access to gender-affirming care [contributes to high rates of suicide among trans youth](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/11/study-finds-epidemic-suicide-among-lgbtq-youth-blame-recent-politics/). And other studies [have found](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/12/hormone-therapy-lowers-suicide-risk-transgender-young-people/) that gender-affirming care actively lowers the risk of depression and suicide in trans youth.  Republicans would rather have dead kids than trans kids. Christian nationalists love to proclaim how they ""love their neighbors"", but how can they love their neighbors when they're doing everything to exterminate them?",southpawFA,2025-05-07T16:54:44,20
My husband transitioned as a child because he was going to end his life. I am so thankful he was allowed to and it destroys me to think that there are other children out there that won’t be allowed to live their lives,candybeep,2025-05-07T18:41:28,9
"This should be treated as mass murder and treason when we return to power.  No more ""unity"" tickets. No more pardons. No more games. I want my fellow Americans and patriots protected from hostile forces, and this ""party"" qualifies as the latter.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-07T23:01:03,6
"""Suicides rise amongst young transgender west virginian's; underlying cause still a mystery.""  I can just imagine how you can have just so little hope that you're on the verge of committing suicide, and now the only thing that could've helped you is taken away. The GOP hates children and would rather they die cis than live as trans.",LockNo2943,2025-05-08T01:00:21,2

How is lgbtqnation.com an acceptable source for /r/politics?,foochacho,2025-05-07T17:07:51,-18
The silence is deafening huh? Bastards.,Nappah_Overdrive,2025-05-07T22:00:20,9
They want them to commit suicide. They're trying to eradicate them from existence.,JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-08T09:44:40,3
I agree.,southpawFA,2025-05-07T17:17:22,5
I blame the right wing sewer media that has the knuckledragging MAGA base believing trans people are singlehandedly ruining America. The GOP can't win elections or govern without a supply of scapegoats to keep their base occupied.,Panjd,2025-05-07T16:59:46,8
"The American Principles Project lies time and time again, and yet no one calls for them to be brought to account.    I have a lot more evidence in this thread, in which they attacked asexual marriages as somehow being a gateway to a ""marriage inferno"" due to no sex being involved. They basically made the case for an 11th commandment, to where everyone has to be forced into sex or else be damned to hellfire!    It's rather interested that they are even mad at asexual people like me for not wanting to have sex, when their whole worldview is steeped in ""purity culture"". It's so outlandish.     They believe in forcing people to procreate, regardless if you're asexual and don't want to. They really are the party of enforced sex. Just ridiculous.

You’ve posted links to the goddamn Daily Mail.,Hestia_Gault,2025-05-07T17:21:02,21
"The same way Daily Mail, Redstate, Fox, thefederalist, NY Post, National Review, and News Week are all acceptable sources.",Ouija_ghosted_me,2025-05-07T17:27:23,11
Because it’s a solid news source for LGBTQ issues?,rockandrollzomby,2025-05-07T17:14:43,12
"Is there a criticism of the contents of the article or are you just complaining about the source? I agree this sub needs to somewhat limit some of the acceptable sources nypost, daily mail which ***you've*** posted, fox, the federalist, national review, and newswork need to be pruned but that has nothing to do with this discussion. Based on your other comments, I think this is more about trying to discredit the contents than a good faith discussion of source reliability.",Purusha120,2025-05-07T17:55:54,7
"Yup. Christian nationalists are always looking for a boogeyman to scare-monger the world over, and trans people are on the genocidal hit list.",southpawFA,2025-05-07T17:08:52,6
"That’s too funny, good catch",rockandrollzomby,2025-05-07T17:40:24,8
"Those are all news organizations. Heck, this sub even disallows other right wing organizations. But this is just a blatant propaganda site.",foochacho,2025-05-07T18:43:36,-12

"They are shameless. I listened to a neighbor carry on about how awful DEI is, but when I asked her to define DEI for me she was clueless. The same with woke and CRT. They pick buzz words and then talk about them endlessly and get the nincompoops all riled up even though they have no idea what they're mad  about.",Panjd,2025-05-07T18:15:59,4
"Daily Mail is a tabloid, the federalist is a propoganda site. Fox isn't a news site, as admitted in the court of law. National Review is a propaganda site.",Ouija_ghosted_me,2025-05-07T18:48:09,9
Propaganda because it’s written by mostly LGBTQ people and covers LGBTQ issues?   To balance it out should they write articles about how LGBTQ people are gross and an affront to god? Would that make you happy?,rockandrollzomby,2025-05-07T20:12:59,2
"They just refuse to admit they only want a world where Christian nationalists exist. They want to kill everyone else off and leave us to the slaughter, because they would rather have dead people than be in community with LGBTQIA+ people, as it goes against their religion.",southpawFA,2025-05-07T18:17:41,4
