Nothing says hardcore gangbanger quite like the default Word font.,ScotTheDuck,2025-04-30T10:29:09,696
"On Tuesday, Trump sat for an interview with ABC News correspondent Terry Moran. Moran asked Trump about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador’s CECOT prison without due process and in violation of a protective order, and who remains in El Salvador despite a Supreme Court ruling demanding he facilitate the man’s return. Trump said (contradicting his administration’s previous public statements) that he “could” pick up the phone and order Abrego Garcia’s return, but that he refused because Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His evidence: “on his knuckles, he had MS-13.”  The photo Trump shared (whose provenance was unclear as of April 21st) depicts a hand with four symbols, above which have been overlaid “M” “S” “1” and “3” in what looks like basic Calibri typeface, apparently translating what are allegedly coded gang symbols. This was dubious in its own right, and critics pointed out that Trump’s post could fool a casual observer into thinking the letters were tattoos, since the image was small and Trump described him as having “‘MS-13’ tattooed onto his knuckles.” Still, you could at least charitably argue the image wasn’t meant to be deceptive — this is basic labeling. “Dragging text boxes in Microsoft Word”-level stuff.  But after this interview, there’s nearly no doubt: Trump really believes — or at least wants people to believe — that Abrego Garcia really has MS13 tattooed on his knuckles in Calibri.

"For several weeks, President Donald Trump and his administration have been grasping for evidence that a man his administration deported and imprisoned in error is a dangerous gang member, and the effort has now reached what may be an untoppable peak: the President repeatedly insisting in an in-person interview that an obvious text label that says MS13 in the Calibri typeface is an actual tattoo.  On Tuesday, Trump sat for an interview with ABC News correspondent Terry Moran. Moran asked Trump about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador’s CECOT prison without due process and in violation of a protective order, and who remains in El Salvador despite a Supreme Court ruling demanding he facilitate the man’s return. Trump said (contradicting his administration’s previous public statements) that he “could” pick up the phone and order Abrego Garcia’s return, but that he refused because Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang. His evidence: “on his knuckles, he had MS-13.”  That would be the sort of evidence the government ordinarily would present at an immigration hearing, but so far it’s refused. Trump has posted what he claims to be an image of these tattoos to his Truth Social account. Here it is:  A closeup of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s hand tattoos with the label “MS 13” overlaid in text. You have perhaps noticed that these are not tattoos of the letters “MS-13.”  The photo Trump shared (whose provenance was unclear as of April 21st) depicts a hand with four symbols, above which have been overlaid “M” “S” “1” and “3” in what looks like basic Calibri typeface, apparently translating what are allegedly coded gang symbols. This was dubious in its own right, and critics pointed out that Trump’s post could fool a casual observer into thinking the letters were tattoos, since the image was small and Trump described him as having “‘MS-13’ tattooed onto his knuckles.” Still, you could at least charitably argue the image wasn’t meant to be deceptive — this is basic labeling. “Dragging text boxes in Microsoft Word”-level stuff.  But after this interview, there’s nearly no doubt: Trump really believes — or at least wants people to believe — that Abrego Garcia really has MS13 tattooed on his knuckles in Calibri.  Moran mildly corrected Trump’s statement: “He had some tattoos that are interpreted that way,” he said, before trying to move on. Trump stopped him and repeated the claim. Then things start getting weird.  Moran: He did not have the letter ‘M’,‘S’,‘1’,‘3’.  Trump: It says ‘M’,‘S’,‘1’,‘3’.  Moran: That was photoshopped. So let me just—  Trump: That was photoshop? Terry, you can’t — hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime. You know, you’re doing the interview. I picked you because — frankly I never heard of you, but that’s okay.  In short: Trump grinds the interview to a halt at the claim Abrego Garcia’s tattoos are symbols.",IndependentRegion104,2025-04-30T11:41:10,3

""That type of concealment goes against the gang's norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.""  >Charles Katz, director of Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety, concurred.   >While Katz said that local law enforcement would be more familiar with specific tattoo designs in a given region, ""I have worked on issues related to MS-13 for the past 15 years in El Salvador and the U.S. and I have never seen tattoos or graffiti suggesting that these particular tattoos are associated with MS-13.""",Heart_Throb_,2025-04-30T12:13:11,2

"It goes beyond political differences.   You really have to realize that his most hardcore supporters have been in an echo chamber the better part of a decade now. 10 years of being conditioned to believe and behave in certain ways.   It becomes very much like cult deprogramming at that point, trying to get people to leave that mindset.   They can’t do that, if they’re still being exposed to it - that’s why deprogramming requires extraction from the cult. Because the process conditions the person to believe a certain subjective truth, reliant on the cult messaging and social environment.   See also the people who used to be hard Rush Limbaugh fans. They still have difficulty, long after his death, adjusting to that loss.   Some people truly can never leave that kind of conditioning behind. Most can. But expecting them to snap tf out of it because you explained a picture to them - that’s also giving up on the people, and the sheer level of severity of that conditioning they’ve been subjected to (willingly) for years. ",Unicoronary,2025-05-01T14:15:57,1
"If I were a national political reporter, I would feel it's my duty to ask questions that hold the administration accountable and question their lies. This isn't a puff-piece for Vogue magazine. And you don't have to spend 20 minutes on it. Ask more specific, direct questions and stop pretending you have to let him lie without calling him out.  ""Mr. Trump. Are you saying you believe MS13 was tattooed on his knuckles? Is that your proof he is part of a gang?"" Get it on record! Don't just say others disagree.  Take the conversation they had about bringing back Abrego Garcia. This was flat-out the most important part of the entire interview. Moran said Trump could pick up the phone and make it happen. And Trump agrees, yes he can. This contradicts 100% what his lawyers are saying in court that the President simply can't do it. The court told him to facilitate his return, and the DOJ responded in court that he can't.   And here Trump flat out says he could do it if he wanted to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers will no doubt present this in court as evidence that he is ignoring SCOTUS rulings when the the DOJ has to respond to the court by 5p tomorrow. That's contempt of court! And the courts are one of the last places we have to fight Trump. THAT is how you hold him accountable. It's not the final nail in the coffin, but it's better than ""let's move on.""  He didn't need to take 20 minutes to do that. He just simply asked Trump a quesiton that let Trump directly contradict himself on national TV that has far-reaching consequences in the court of law, with a judge is already PISSED.  Everyone but MAGA knows Trump is a liar, and slowly it's becoming more clear to others that he is in cognitive decline. MAGA won't hear this, but that wouldn't make a difference.

"Telling people ""no, Trump really is that stupid"" cuts through this illusion that anything would have ever have been ""business as usual"" regardless of who won the Presidency. Most people are disconnected from politics, not thinking their input has any real effect. That things will always be the same, regardless of who is in charge.  People need to know that not merely is pretending things are ""business as usual"" is not going to work, but that EVERYTHING they hold dear as stability is at-risk of going up in smoke if something isn't done to stop Trump.  Trump may be dumb as bricks, but he very much thinks he can get away with being a dictator regardless, and is acting as if he already were.
