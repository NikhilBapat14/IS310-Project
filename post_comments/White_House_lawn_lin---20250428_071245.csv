If I could go one day without seeing news about how this administration is doing something that seems distinctly like something Nazi Germany would do I would be so happy.,samx3i,2025-04-28T07:15:14,42
"A Convicted Felon, who is also an adjudicated rapist, lives in the White House.  Neither Trump nor his ass-kissing, right-wing rags like the NY Post have moral superiority on crimes.",ResidentKelpien,2025-04-28T07:18:02,26
"Wow, 34 felonies and liability for sexual abuse...hey how'd this Trump picture get out here?!",gorillasuitriot,2025-04-28T07:19:20,27
Would not be surprised if they had an intern generate fake mugshots with artificial intelligence. Some of these aren’t proper law enforcement mugs.,Not-ur-Infosec-guy,2025-04-28T07:23:30,8

It. Doesn’t. Matter. Due process must still be applied. Give them their day in court then we can talk about “crimes”,Quirky_Parfait3864,2025-04-28T07:28:32,5
Not enough space on that lawn for all the mugshots of US citizen MAGA supporters' mugshots and the crimes they committed. 🙄,am_i_phone,2025-04-28T07:39:32,5
"I’m not American, but in general I 100% agree that if someone comes from another country and commits a violent crime or are habitual criminals they should be deported, but they should still get their due process otherwise it can happen to anybody.   What I don’t agree with is calling asylum seekers illegals, and suspending the rights of people with papers.",Farkenoathm8-E,2025-04-28T07:22:04,5

"I saw someone post a picture of Trump's mugshot hung right outside the Oval Office, so this seems to be a decoration choice they prefer.",jaybigs,2025-04-28T13:32:57,1
So they are putting pictures of the ten or twenty percent of those who actually committed crimes - what about the others who were essentially abducted without any due process.,chimarya,2025-04-28T07:35:24,0

"That is the position of most logical people, including leftists, yes. That is not what MAGA wants.",howdybeachboy,2025-04-28T07:25:39,8
On the other hand the number Trump is trying to convince people are happening are actually pretty low.  People who come here generally want to stay.  They are better at following the laws than a larger percentage of people born here.,TintedApostle,2025-04-28T07:24:55,4
"Remember, this is the Trump White House. They do things a bit differently from normal folk.  If we were to research each person pictured, we'd find that they are either AI-generated pictures of non-existent folk or they are real pictures of people who have not committed any crimes.   In other words it's all lies. What else can we expect from the Trump White House.",crazybones,2025-04-28T08:26:15,0

"Nothing more real than over 30 years since immigration legislation of significance has passed into law. But sure, putting individuals' pictures on the lawn is the obvious real solution.    The same party controls the executive, has majorities in the house and Senate, and an ideologically aligned Supreme Court. This is the extent of the real solutions they are capable of.

"Well by default 100% of illegal immigrants have broken the law and it's doubtful that 100% of USA citizens have...  I'm not for mass deportations of every *literally* illegal immigrant, but borders have to mean something.",htx1114,2025-04-28T23:48:11,1
"and yet again so what...  by default means nothing.  By default a large number of business owners have hired illegals as that is primarily why they come.   Meanwhile prior to 1920 there such thing as an illegal immigrant.    >but borders have to mean something.  Well lets stand in the present and not that by penalizing business owners decades ago we would have slowed all movement, but the citizens would have complained about high prices and business would have had to raise wages.  If we addressed immigration by offering existing amnesty to citizenship paths as well as increased legal and border presence we would have been way more successful, cost less and maintained progress.   Borders do mean something.  They got in the way of business.",TintedApostle,2025-04-29T06:42:20,1
