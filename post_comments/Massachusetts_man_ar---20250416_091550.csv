"We had a lot of mental institutions in Mass, all shut down. We never had this type of stuff back in the 80s and 90s. They were all there.",Basic_Lunch2197,2025-04-16T09:32:46,6

"A lot of the crazy we have today is that *willful* kind of crazy - the kind where nobody is really going to stop them so they'll just do whatever they damn well feel like, they'll assault workers on the job for not giving them their way.  ""You're not in charge here, ***I'M in charge here!!*****""** \-the typical modern arrestee, screaming at police/medics/cashiers/witnesses before they get taken downtown for booking and a night in the sober-up cell. (It's all on Youtube, but beware binge watching will make them stop suggesting anything else.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T11:56:43,2
Not *all* shut down   But I don’t think the little incident where they fed mentally disabled children plutonium or the graves behind Fernald’s with numbers instead of names were good for the optics ,SpecialistNote6535,2025-04-16T12:08:08,1
I think that is partly true. Lots of kids were not hit when younger so they really have no understanding of punishment. But I would say 80% of the homeless is probably mentally challenged.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-04-16T12:12:56,3
Very true. Also places like the Fernald were just money pits. So old.,Basic_Lunch2197,2025-04-16T12:17:05,1
"There's a massive drug problem. People who abuse the hardest substances end up unemployable and they also end up too toxic for their families to handle.  The mental challenge isn't simply *special needs,* my family has careers running up and down the special ed system going up into district offices and they've got long histories of success stories where people who grew up poor and neglected (in a *bad* town) end up self-starting and having good careers.  Homelessness is often the end of the line for people who did too much drugs for their employer to handle, too much for their family to handle. Reddit wants to act like the entire problem can be solved ***for the cost of a home*** \- but this experiment gets tried all over the world and the result is that the homes just get destroyed. So Reddit just says the entire problem can be solved for the cost ***of another home.*** When authorities turn blind eyes to homeless encampments springing up on their own, a fire breaks out *and the encampment gets destroyed too.*   The homeless problem flares up in blue states.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-16T12:49:26,3
