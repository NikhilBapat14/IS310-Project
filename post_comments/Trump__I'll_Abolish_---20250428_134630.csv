"I feel like this election has been highjacked. Upfront what won the election is anti wokeness and anti migrants. What was really at stakes was the reversal of America's former middle-class decay and infrastructure crumble.  Wokeness really has been a cultural war on top of a social war that ruined the lives of anyone who used to live from industry. It is to say to the guy who is unemployed or living on the edge on gig economy for the better part of his life 'the problem is not that you can work 80 hours a week and still not being able to afford a rent, the problem is that your way to talk and basically your skin coulour is racist', 'can't pay for medecine you say ? Ok, but what about gendered neutral bathrooms ? You're not fine with that, or you just don't care ? That's nazism. You deserve anything and everything happening to you! '  In the end, the ones who win are always the rich people. The only thing they want is to suppress taxes and regulations that prevent the rich from exploiting, poisoning, scamming, murdering the not rich people.",Juract,2025-04-28T15:29:14,205

"Depends    Previously I heard Trump say he would remove income tax for those making less than 150K and offset it with tariffs.   Last year approximately $60bn in revenue came from taxes on those making less than 150K.  The US imports $4 trillion dollars worth of goods.   Theoretically a blanket 2% tariff on all imported goods would generate $80 Bn in revenue from trade, which would offset the tax revenue of those who make $150k or less.   This gets exponentially harder and impossible as you increase the income threshold. Total income Tax revenue amounts to $5 trillion, so to wipe away all income tax for everyone, you would basically need to double your trade revenues (actually more than double).   Now these are all rough approximations because I don't have the time to get granular, but theoretically there's a level of tax revenue you could replace with trade revenue from tariffs. But it's not going to be the entirety of the income tax revenue.",Opening-Citron2733,2025-04-28T14:50:03,-84

Whiny diatribe against the wealthy… leftist playbook 101.   The middle class is decaying… people that were formerly middle class are now *gasp* upper middle class.   Even thou it’s a right wing sub… it’s still reddit. Some people could use a dose of reality on income mobility in America.,Texas103,2025-04-28T20:46:55,-50

"I say flat tax, high standard deduction. When you make $25k, 10% of that is a lot of money. When you make $250k, 10% of the amount over $150k isn't as significant to you.",Mountain_Man_88,2025-04-28T17:44:50,0

"Total income tax revenue is around 2.2 trillion, not 5.  Your main point is still valid, replacing tax revenue with tariffs doesn’t work well regardless.",RotoDog,2025-04-28T14:55:39,107
"I'm fairly certain the aim is to abolish it for the 200K and below tax bracket.   So even if you made 10 million you wouldn't pay taxes on your first 200k.   Otherwise it doesn't make a lot of sense. If I make 205,000 a year I gotta pay taxes on all of it? I'll just ask my boss to decrease my salary if that's the case.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-28T20:13:25,31
"Very true. It's actually impressive how effective the gaslighting is covincing people that the middle class has gotten poorer. It's because it's a convenient thing for people to believe, on both sides of the spectrum. It's convenient because it gives people something to blame for life's struggles. ""I'm not doing as well financially as I'd like to be, oh it must be because of capitalist institutions stealing all my money unfairly. Previous generations didn't have to deal with this and they were so much better off!"" That's a lie.  While it IS true that wealth disparity has increased over the time, the middle class has also gotten objectively wealthier. Everyone is better off, not just the rich, though they have benefited the most. People don't \*want\* to believe this because life isn't easy, and believing that you are worse off than everyone else because of some fundamental unfairness that is somehow exceptional to America and exceptional only to our generation and outside our control helps ease the pain and unburden the psyche by removing any ponderance that one might actually hold some personal responsibility for the dissatisfaction of where life has take them, which isn't an easy thing to stomach psychologically.  Don't take my word for any of these statistical claims though, and please don't take the word of some brainwashed marxist leftist automatons. Look it up for yourself. Please, look up the actual data. I'll give you a link to start with, stats directly from the Fed:  [Real Median Household Income in the United States (MEHOINUSA672N) | FRED | St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N)  Median household income today, in the United States, controlled for inflation, is over 80,000 which is higher than at any point in the history of the country. The middle class was not wealthier in the 60s-80s, despite people claiming that as the ""golden era"" of middle class living. Though houses were the one single thing that was more affordable and that has only been true since covid. Almost everything else was actually more expensive.  So how are Americans doing compared to other countries? Again, we are absolutely killing it, but leftists continue to gaslight and act like American middle class is poor and hard-done-by compared to socialist nations. The truth is, the middle class in every single ""rich"" European socialist nation has less disposable income than America's middle class.

"Yep that's fair, the $5 trillion was all forms of taxes    I think it just depends on what they mean in their messaging. Generating ~$100 Bn tlon trade revenue to reduce the tax burden is a reasonable goal. Replacing the entire income tax burden is not",Opening-Citron2733,2025-04-29T07:51:04,2

"This 1000%. Thank you. The cold truth is that life has gotten much better for middle class Americans.   Wealth inequality does not intrinsically hurt people. The existence of Musk and Bezos and Gates does not mean “the system” failed you.   I’d also argue that the expensive housing issue is not a failure of capitalism, that’s a failure to build affordable housing. Which is most likely a regulatory issue. ",Texas103,2025-04-29T00:28:50,-4
