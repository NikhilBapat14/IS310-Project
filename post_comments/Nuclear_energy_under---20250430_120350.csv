"We definitely need to become more independent, energy-wise",Joebama_the3rd,2025-04-30T12:14:52,36
"Small modular reactors are ""small, affordable, safe, dispatchable, clean energy that we can put anywhere we need it,"" Robinson told Flock.  Robinson told Flock there are ""two projects that have construction permits from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission"" for advanced nuclear reactors.   ""We are one of those,"" he said.   ""Weâ€™re standing in the only advanced reactor facility in the nation,"" Robinson added during the interview. ""So we are moving toward construction of this reactor with our commercial reactors running parallel.""   More winning!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T12:40:24,23
Nuclear power plant construction is the missing puzzle piece that lets us take full part in the next age instead of being left behind.  Which is why the left is going to fight it like crazy - anything that strengthens or secures USA is their enemy. They'll brag day and night about PRC building a reactor then scream bloody murder when we try to do the same.,D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-30T12:38:23,22
Fantastic news.  We need to catch up with China on this and reinvest in nuclear.  It is the best way towards energy independence,cathbadh,2025-04-30T18:58:21,6
"It's a huge tell that the climate change idiots haven't been advocating for nuclear all along.  The power needs of server farms have finally forced the issue.  Ask Spain how ""zero E"" without nuclear base load is working out.",TedriccoJones,2025-05-03T07:00:07,2
"We'll never get affordable nuclear power until we accurately address why leftists and progressives want to make it artificially expensive in the first place: They hate nuclear power because it actually can solve all of the environmental problems they pretend to care about... but without acting as an excuse for massively expanded government control over the economy and other aspects of people's lives.  Every single supposed technological problem they claim is stopping us has not only been solved, it's been solved for a half century at this point.",Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-05T12:07:28,1
