"I'm a veteran. The VA has always been horrible, but under Biden it finally started to get better. Why? Because they hired more people. Efficiency is achieved by streamlining processes not by reducing manpower. All of those employees are essential.",totalkpolitics,2025-05-06T19:56:56,23
The VA has started turning patients away already. Procedures are being canceled and pushed out indefinitely,Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-06T19:49:37,15

That is obvious b.s.  Job cuts to an already resource constrained department will not magically improve efficiency.,ResidentKelpien,2025-05-06T19:49:34,7

"Why is that even a “goal”? I hate it when businesses do shot like this - pull a number out of thin air. He has no idea what it would take to be efficient, no one in their right mind would say firing 80,000 people is a good goal and you would be more efficient.",Initial-Toe-9512,2025-05-06T19:50:06,5
Don't veterans have some of these jobs?  I think that's also a concern here.  Asshole. ,arilupe,2025-05-06T20:03:13,5
You know what would improve enlistment numbers? If you don’t throw vets in the side of the road after their service is done.,VladtheInhaler999,2025-05-06T20:16:14,5
No it won't.  Don't believe this nonsense.,pinetreesgreen,2025-05-06T20:18:21,3
Maybe we start with the secretary. That would improve efficiency.,OldschoolScience,2025-05-06T20:46:11,3
I'm from GA and know this dude well. He's completely full of shit. Don't trust him. He will fumble and fuck it all up.,Thewallmachine,2025-05-06T22:18:56,3
"From the article:  Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins on Tuesday accused Democrats of fearmongering while they oppose proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs workforce.  Reports have suggested Collins wants to eliminate more than 80,000 VA jobs, but he told the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs that number is a goal and not a hard target.  Collins told the committee he wants to reduce the VA's workforce by 15%, which would mean firing more than 80,000 workers, but that goal has not become a reality.  The VA so far has fired 2,400 workers and intends to end 585 contracts, NBC News reported.  Collins told committee members he would like to eliminate another 70,500 non-essential positions within the department to make it more efficient.",kootles10,2025-05-06T19:42:45,3

My local VA medical center had already been canceling veterans' cancer trials because they're now understaffed. And that first reduction was a blip compared to what they know want to do.,ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-07T01:40:08,2

Well it probably true the individuals will get more done on average but it definitely won’t accomplish more than they are doing right now as a whole.,More-Conversation931,2025-05-06T21:51:29,1
"I once worked at a place that, yearly, fired 10% of the non-managerial staff.  After about 10 years they had only one person on the production line; but they sure had a lot of managers.  /d",Catspaw129,2025-05-06T21:57:18,1

Nah. They're going with crashing the economy because very high unemployment helps the enlistment numbers.,StickaFORKinMyEye,2025-05-06T21:52:40,3
