Alright folks we found it. The dumbest poll question of all time,thisisjman,2025-05-02T15:35:58,26

"I can virtually guarantee that if Harris always president, I would probably be planning for a big cruise vacation in Europe instead of procuring food and toilet paper, plus hiding my money under my bed",Palidor,2025-05-02T15:37:31,32
"The US is being run by unqualified hacks like Lutnick, Bessent and Hegseth, and apparently 45% of Americans think that is better than what Harris would have offered. Wow.",Everywhereslugs,2025-05-02T15:39:15,9
"Who gives a shit who the voters IMAGINE would be worse? The Democrats track record on the economy speaks for itself: they have always led stronger economies overall. Besides, these dumbass voters are the ones that picked trump in the first place, of course they would say he is handling it better in the hypothetical they cooked up with their glass-like smooth brains.",LW_GLAZER,2025-05-02T15:44:28,9

"> CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Americans still believe President Donald Trump would currently be doing a better job than former Vice President Kamala Harris.  > Although Trump’s polling numbers are currently underwater, he is leading Harris 45% to 43% on the question of “who’d be doing a better job as president,” according to a CNN/SSRS poll. Public polling has repeatedly shown that Trump is performing better than Democrats when it comes to handling their top issues, indicating that the party is not appealing to Americans, Enten said.

"Trump won because people who hated both of them broke for him, the same thing that happened in 2016. Advice for democrats, don't nominate AOC. She is not Obama, she is not an unknown entity, everyone knows her and outside of the left most people do not like her and the same dynamic that happened in 2016 and 2024 will repeat itself in 2028 if she is the nominee.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-05-02T15:44:55,-3

CNN has almost fully transitioned into Conservative News Network. They've been sliding that direction for years. The sane-washing they did for trump ahead of the election was insane to see.,LW_GLAZER,2025-05-02T15:46:24,4
"I'm horrified to be thinking that many Americans believe that **[Women aren't ""real"" humans](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/mackinnon-women-are-not-human/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/mackinnon-women-are-not-human/)**.    >In legal terms, women are not human, according to MacKinnon, who discovered that fact while parsing the language of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 1948 United Nations document defines what a human is, and what people are universally entitled to — but fails to explicitly recognize women, and their “full human status in social reality,” said MacKinnon.  >Being human first requires being “real to power,” she said, and women are not. While most states explicitly guarantee women sexual equality, the reality — filtered through cultural norms — is often quite different. Women have status, but not a real place in statehood.  >Why? “The state is of and by men and usually for them,” said MacKinnon. “Gender inequality is a global system.”    I think it's  might be reason the Democrats lost to the Republicans. It wasn't that they lost to Trump policies, it's that they tried to put what many considered a ""less-than-human"" into a position of power over real humans.",OMG__Ponies,2025-05-02T15:56:20,4

"I think Republicans won because the MAGA base lack of decent education.
