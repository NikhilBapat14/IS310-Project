"Can't say I feel sorry for them, if I'm being honest. They're in for a rude awakening by thinking that voting for Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Trump was going to be a good thing. And yet I'm sure those dumb voters will never change their ways in future elections.",Annual_Plant5172,2025-04-23T16:01:01,1

"What makes you think they'll ever figure it out?    They won't. When Hitler became Chancellor and when Mussolini became Il Duce, most citizens in those countries totally bought into it. There was no revolt. There were a few individuals who figured it out and they paid the price but most people were totally fine with it.     I've got diaries of Germans even in 1942 - 1944 when itwas clear the Germany was losing the war, who still totally bought into the myth.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-23T14:46:37,6

We’ve been screaming that at the top of our lungs even before his 1st presidency and nobody will listen…..,BenefitAdvanced,2025-04-23T17:45:28,1

"And even if they do 1945 Germany was the Tottenreit or death ride. The people generally committed to fighting to the end despite the folly of it. In Japans case the planned sacrifice of the 100 million as they framed it. Even after the lies were exposed, they can just transform the narrative into one of sacrifice for the cause. (Even Italy was basically a civil war until the end with the Italian Social Republic under Mussolini and a dedicated core of facists, same with Hungary following the iron guard coup as always a willingness to fight for a lost cause rather than admit defeat or that they were wrong).",cjh42,2025-04-23T15:45:43,2
