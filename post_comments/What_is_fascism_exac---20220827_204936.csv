"Entire books have been written on this subject.  I don't think it's wrong to say that ""fascist"" has become somewhat of an over-used insult or accusation but that doesn't change the fact that it does have an actual meaning.  If you wanted to *really* cut it down to the wiring of a definition of fascism, that's doable.  Fascism is a political ideology that revolves around the centralized power of the state as the embodiment of a national character, often represented by a single individual or small group, it heavily relies on an idealized/mythological a-historical that's pieced together specifically for the purpose of creating the idea of a single, unified national identity. There's a strong militaristic/law and order bent with a high degree of social militarization and adulation of the armed forces that also ties into a cult of heroism and action along with a glorification of violence for the sake of the state with an intense focus on internal/external ""enemies"" that threaten to destroy everything.  Fascism is *highly* syncretic and that broad framework can map onto almost any cultural context. You had Showa Nationalism in Japan, Falangism in Spain, Nazism in Germany, and Shirt movements in dozens of countries around the world.   Anywhere you can mix ideas of intense nationalism, authoritarian state control, rejuvenating powers of violence, and a unified/idealized cultural/ethnic/historical identity you can end up with fascism.  There's the famous 14 characteristics of fascism as put forth by Umberto Eco and while these are helpful guides, people tend to treat these like a checklist - if it doesn't meet one of the criteria on the list exactly then it's not fascism. ""Ur-Fascism"" is still an excellent read even today but again, people tend to use Eco's thesis as a diagnostic tool rather than a prompt for inquiry.  Of course, actual fascists love to cite the list because they can push to do this deliberately as a way of avoiding having their favorite fascist state/movement be characterized as such.",HeloRising,2022-09-03T04:32:06,4
