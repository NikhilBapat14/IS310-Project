Basic human decency is antagonistic to MAGA...,whatzgood,2025-05-09T23:27:21,53

"> But some of Mr. Trump’s most fervent followers do not appear to be feeling the excitement.  Trump’s most fervent followers, and the leader of the White House Faith Office, are New Apostolic Reformationists. These non-denominational evangelical weirdos probably wouldn’t like any Pope and likely think the Cardinals are possessed by literal demons.  Salon - [I Went to a Pro-Trump Christian Revival. It Completely Changed My Understanding of Jan. 6.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/09/donald-trump-2024-president-election-shooting-christians.html)  “They’re gathering by the thousands. They’re growing fast. They believe that Democrats are possessed by demons—and that Donald Trump must be president again at any cost.”  “They believe that under Trump’s protection, American Christians will rise up, defeat their demonic enemies, and take their rightful place of power in the country.”  The Atlantic - [The Army of God Comes Out of the Shadows](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2025/02/new-apostolic-reformation-christian-movement-trump/681092/)  “He needed a way to rally evangelicals, so he turned to some of the most influential apostles and prophets of the NAR, a wilder world where he was cast as God’s ‘wrecking ball’ and embraced by a fresh pool of so-called prophecy voters, people long regarded as the embarrassing riffraff of evangelical Christianity.”  “A march called ‘A Million Women’ on the National Mall drew tens of thousands of people and culminated with the smashing of an altar representing demonic strongholds in America. With the Capitol dome as their backdrop, people took turns bashing the altar as music surged and others prayed, and when it was rubble, the prophet Lou Engle declared, ‘We’re going to point to the north, south, and east, and west, and command America! The veil has been ripped!’  The NAR movement was a major source of the ‘low-propensity voters’ who backed Trump.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-10T00:24:59,5
The biggest part of the MAGA base are white evangelical protestants its no surprise they hate the pope they have never been a fan of Catholics or Mormons or any others for that matter.,sedatedlife,2025-05-10T02:53:51,7
"I find it hilarious that Americans are pissed the Pope isn't America First. They seem to conflate God with the US presidency. Some seem to believe Jesus founded the nation.  I also found it hilarious that VP Vance, a recent and zealous convert to Catholicism, presumed to tell a pope what Catholicism is. If he's that much of a believer, he should know that God himself speaks through the Pope.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-10T05:58:00,6

"It's probably a testament to how much of a middle ground candidate the new pope actually is that he has been widely praised by the middle ground, and regarded with suspicion by both the progressives and conservatives within and outside the church. MAGA may have to accept that his election wasn't anything about them, or even the USA, but about choosing a leader who can inspire Catholics around the globe, manage the bureaucracy and finances of the Vatican, and make comments/rulings on doctrinal issues in accordance with Catholic canon law (not USA political opinions). I'd be fascinated to see MAGA making commentary on the wokeness or otherwise of the leaderahips of the world's various Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish and other faiths. The USA is around 4.2% of the global population, MAGA represents at the very most 30% of the USA, so probably in total no more than 1.3% of the world. And the other 98.7% of the world isn't interested in their toddler tantrums.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-05-10T01:11:10,3

I know that some people on Twitter have called him woke a few times but I haven’t seen anyone right or left complain too much. Did hear some girls in a hallway at my college complain that he is American but I’m not sure if that’s a common complaint,Lunarsynergy,2025-05-09T23:55:35,1

There's no such thing as a liberal pope. It doesn't get any more totalitarian than a king who literally thinks he represents God on Earth. MAGAts just think their guy should be the GodKing.,zomboscott,2025-05-10T10:37:28,1
The Anti-Pope propaganda is already circulating online like crazy!,ArcadeAcademic,2025-05-10T10:40:07,1
"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.  The *only* thing one on top of social hierarchy can do to lose conservative support is to disrespect their hierarchy by restricting, scrutinizing, and taking resources away from those they consider socially superior, and/or offering rights, credibility, and resources to those they consider socially inferior -- [as in the case of Joseph Strickland and the late Pope Francis](https://www.texastribune.org/2023/11/11/new-article-Tyler-Bishop-Joseph-Strickland-removed/).  In other words, any promotion of equality/equity (disrespect to hierarchy) nullifies their authority, as authority exists to *promote and maintain* respect for and obedience to hierarchy.
