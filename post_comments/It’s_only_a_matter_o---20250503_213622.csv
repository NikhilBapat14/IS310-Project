Yea no doubt its gonna eventually result in someone innocent getting shot because these idiots ran into the wrong house unannounced and the owner was armed...and as fucked up as this sounds its gonna have be a white person getting shot otherwise nobody outside of the media will care,FickleSystem,2025-05-03T22:11:31,59
"How TF are people supposed to know if it's really ICE abducting someone off the street or just (regular) criminals?   I mean, you're standing around and a black panel van pulls up and half a dozen guys in masks jump out and grab someone off the street. Maybe I watch too many procedural shows but to me that seems like a perfect way to kidnap someone.",Hippy_Lynne,2025-05-04T01:00:29,22

At some point ICE is going to do a no-knock raid on a gun nut with anti-tank rockets and a bunker.,nanoatzin,2025-05-04T03:42:19,5

"I would say that they already have gone wrong, but they are certainly trying to provoke us into making it go terribly wrong. It’ll be a perfect pretext for the insurrection act, suspension of habeus corpus, martial law, and suspension of federal elections.",mettiusfufettius,2025-05-04T08:52:12,3
"It already has gone wrong many times, but yeah, we are also going to get more and more of the stuff like the Weezer police shooting thing.   Constitutional law still is higher than Trump law, and Trump is giving temporary permits for mercenaries to be above Constitutional law. When any case ends up in court it's two opposing laws which at the moment still leans to the Constitution.   If you have one guy who is innocent under Constitutional law but guilty under Trump vs. another guy who has the vice versa laws, who is the winner and loser in this?   Also, when secret police who are permitted to hide their identity ever way possible when their job is to disappear and murder people, what is stopping citizens from pretending to be secret police?   As the law stands most everybody has the right to bear arms and also has the right to self defense. That right to self defense means that there's a lot of situations where they are allowed to kill somebody if they believe their life is in danger under the general definition. If a secret police attempts to kidnap you doesn't that give the right to self defense to the person being kidnapped and even the people attempting to protect that person. Prior to Trump's orders that type of thing was my guess is over 95% have the right to self defense taking each account on a case by case basis meaning that some of the variables and legal definitions or even legal mistakes could change that.   Trump's orders enter worse than Wild West legal territory. By some standard plenty of the Wild West sort of had self defense figured out.",SimonGloom2,2025-05-04T18:15:04,3
"And the ICE agents' deaths will be spun into an excuse to enact marshal law.  Instead of simply using reasonable procedures that law enforcement has used for decades, they will eliminate our rights.",MrYdobon,2025-05-04T07:33:25,2

TBH I'm surprised it hasn't already happened with the way the administration is bent on speedrunning their ineptitude.,JoviAMP,2025-05-04T09:45:34,2
"I'm not even sure who these ICE agents are. It seems to me, that these are just absolute psychos who probably failed all psychological testing for police academies. The reckless way that they're going about these raids, is almost as if they're engaged in recreational blood sport.",LivingIndependence,2025-05-04T10:53:04,7
"You cant, and they're doing it that way on purpose. There's some information circulating that they've contracted bounty hunters and civilians to help with round ups.    My position is this: if they're in plain clothes and don't identify themselves, then its a crime being committed and I have a right to defend myself and others.    And my state has constitutional carry. ",Dismal_Ad_4736,2025-05-05T03:05:32,3

Someone on another sub had a link to an article speculating that ICE is hiring people through defense contractors and deputizing them. And specifically recruiting people from hate groups because quite frankly they don't have many applicants.,Hippy_Lynne,2025-05-04T17:48:40,4
