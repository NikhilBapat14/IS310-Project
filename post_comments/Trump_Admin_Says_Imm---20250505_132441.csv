If anybody believes this I've got a bridge to sell you.,TheDamDog,2025-05-05T13:25:56,20
20 million illegals (he claims) so that’s only 20 billion dollars.  Thats only about 20x what doge claims to have saved us.  Sounds like a good deal. Especially because it will raise the cost of labor and prices of everything domestically.,GoodiesHQ,2025-05-05T13:27:42,12
"They went from charging $800 per day to paying $1000 in a month.   The great negotiator, ladies and gentlemen.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-05T13:26:01,11

"Previously Trump could only conceptualize a few amounts of money:  under $10, above that is $1 million, above that is ""millions and millions,"" $1 billion, and then ""billions and billions.""  Knowing about thousands is new to him, although I'd be shocked if he went so far as to know how many thousands it would take to get to a million.",mmhannah,2025-05-05T13:34:58,3
It would be much cheaper to just provide a path to citizenship.,TintedApostle,2025-05-05T14:06:59,4

"Australian here. I haven’t illegally immigrated to the US, true. But if I promise not to do so can I still get my $1,000 bucks?",Minguseyes,2025-05-05T14:26:35,2
Here's the answer I agree with on this issue. We are here now: [https://youtu.be/S\_naItk8Egc?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/S_naItk8Egc?feature=shared),williamgman,2025-05-05T13:33:06,1

"Even if they are paying $1000 that is a pretty damn insignificant sum of money, $1000 disappears in no time these days.  Shit, most 1 bedroom apartments rent for well over $1000 a month across most of the US. Anyone taking up this offer is dumb as shit, even if they keep their word.",Bircka,2025-05-06T04:53:52,1
"It would be cheaper to just provide due process, a path to citizenship and increase border security.  I am very serious.  Trump is proving that republicans never thought anything through.  It was all about fear.",TintedApostle,2025-05-05T14:08:32,6
