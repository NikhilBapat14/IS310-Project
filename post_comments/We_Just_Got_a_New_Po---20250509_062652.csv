This time around they had been fed this lurid fantasy that the next Pope could be some kind of ""MAGA pope"" who'd somehow magically fall into line with every aspect of their world view.  Maybe part of that fantasy also is that they felt in some way that between the influence of Trump himself and all his billionaire backers like Musk and Thiel that they could somehow ""buy"" the papacy - which would be pretty funny because this is the Catholic Church we're talking about and they've been around a while. In fact the last person who successfully managed to buy their way into being pope was Alexander VI in 1492 and he was literally a Borgia whose own illegitimate son was Cesare Borgia, the very inspiration for Machiavelli's The Prince...so this is an institution that's had hundreds of years to practice since dealing with the kind of people who literally inspired the book on Machiavellian scheming.
