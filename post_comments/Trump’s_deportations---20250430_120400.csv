"Trump‚Äôs policies will unironically gut a lot of small towns.  The immigration policies are part of it.  Cutting Medicare and Medicaid, which really are what fund hospitals in rural areas, will cause hospitals to close, which will cause an inevitable chain reaction as well paid workers leave and elderly folks are less likely to retire there.",FawningDeer37,2025-04-30T12:13:12,14

"It's just so crazy that the areas most dependant on the federal government are rural areas, and the states most dependant on the federal government are red states.  They are literally voting to destroy their own communities and have no idea because they think they are owning the libs.  A rural area cannot support a hospital, it needs money from the big cities for it to operate.  I get that everyone is going to be hurt, but it's insane how his policies are Lazer targeted to destroy his maga base, though they will never believe this, because they only believe Trump and think everyone else is lying.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-30T13:08:58,9
