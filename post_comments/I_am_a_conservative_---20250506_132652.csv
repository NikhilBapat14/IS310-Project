"It depends. UC Berkeley is definitely not conservative friendly, so unless you’re willing to have long, heated debates with people who aren’t genuinely interested in different viewpoints then it’s just better to avoid politics most of the time. At least on campus, where saying the “wrong” thing or using the wrong pronouns might get you fired.   However, it’s sometimes inevitable to get mixed (and often negative) reactions when teaching. This always happens when I explain the IS-LM-PC model in macroeconomics. I can feel that a lot of people are easily annoyed when I show how things such as minimum wages and welfare discourage employment and slow down productivity most of the time. Note that this is purely from an economic perspective that is widely recognized in academia, so bias has no place in this case.   They’re not interested in that, however. They’ve already formed their opinions and only look for evidence that backs them up. It’s pretty much the opposite of intellectual curiosity, which I’d argue is a quality everybody should have.   In my free time, I don’t have to abide by any specific rules so I express my opinions more freely. I’ve been consulted by several state governments (mostly Republican) and have always presented findings devoid of any ideological bias (which means they tend to be more on the “classical liberal” and anti-regulation side, though this is not always the case).",TypicalWisdom,2025-05-06T16:20:16,416

"Personally speaking, it's hard to make ends meet and I'm often forced to teach part time classes at USF and UC Davis. This is on top of the stipend and full waiver I already get.  CA is overtaxed, that is for sure. What's interesting is that the state relies heavily on high income earners, so its budget is highly vulnerable to stock market fluctuations (e.g. tech stock crashes). That means, ironically, that even though the state is one of the richest in the nation its citizens are more likely to fall into poverty than in any other state.  We also have regressive sales taxes, which disincentivize consumption. They fall a lot harder on low/middle income (""middle class"") residents who spend a large share of their income on taxable goods rather than high earners, who are more likely to save up most of their income.   This, along with high income, housing taxes (think of Prop 13, which capped property tax increases benefits to longtime homeowners but shifted the burden to new buyers/renters) + fees starves the middle class the most, while driving businesses and high earners out.  The tax system would have to be completely reformed but I doubt that's likely to happen anytime soon.",TypicalWisdom,2025-05-06T16:49:00,133

"Interesting question. I can't speak for the original poster; however, I'm a conservative (with advanced degrees) living in the Bay Area.  I'm a staunch fiscal, social *and* religious conservative. The fiscal conservatism is easier to define. In terms of religious conservatism: I favor the protection of religious liberties that aren't absolutely binding upon the public (and vice versa). However, I lean toward libertarian views on social/religious issues. In other words, if our nation is going to err on any divisive issues, then I think that they should err on the side of individual and collective freedom/liberities.  At the same time, I also understand that the law (and policy) is based upon the consent of the majority of the governed. If the majority of the governed push for policy (that isn't unconstitutional in nature), then I can accept it as it being the will of the governed.  I may strongly disagree with it; however, in such cases, the solution is to change people's opinions rather than codify divisive law. In fact, I think that laws where slim majorities agree shouldn't be laws. This is where I feel that states can and should take a lead on such matters. For example: If Texas allows vouchers to go to parochial schools and it is passes constitutional muster, then I am in favor of them becoming the law of the state. However, if Massachusetts doesn't permit it, then I accept their decision too.",chrismireya,2025-05-06T15:11:01,35

" Absolutely. There are lots examples where regulation caused harm, and it is usually the case.   As a monetary economist I’ll say an example of this is the Dodd-Frank act. You won’t find many academics arguing against it but for me personally, it’s been an absolute disaster.   It was meant to regulate “too big to fail” banks, tons of small banks got hit with compliance costs they couldn’t afford. Tons of them either shut down or merged, hence reducing access to credit in rural areas and small communities. Exactly the opposite of what the regulation was supposed to help.  The real “regulation” needs to prevent things such as Insider Trading to prevent market manipulation and maintain confidence in investing. This is key, as lots of middle class Americans consume more than they should invest and this in turn makes them more susceptible to market fluctuations and therefore to poverty. George Soros, for one, single-handedly destroyed the BoE and sent hundreds of thousands of people to the streets.   Other examples would be capital requirements for banks (relative to their risk weighed-assets) to act as a buffer zone to absorb losses and prevent them from being overleveraged (and avoid the great recession 2.0) and implementing liquidity requirements (this is often done via reserve ratio) to ensure banks can meet withdrawal demands (banks are a bit of a beast that is too prone to risk when it comes to making a profit. I would argue Lehman Brothers knew beforehand that they would eventually collapse) and in order to reduce the chance of liquidity crisis spreading across the system (we refer to this phenomena as “contagion”. Think of the Black Plague, which started in Asia as a relatively insignificant disease and then eventually killed half of the European population).  Another type of “regulation” I’m extremely in favor of is Stress Testing. It’s often hard to know whether a bank is going to make it through economic downturns and regulators need to find out via economic shocks to assess their situation and identify weak points in advance.",TypicalWisdom,2025-05-07T06:20:38,15

"Yes...and no. While I believe that law is based upon the consent of the majority, I understand that individual morality guides that consent. Consequently, morality is often highly influenced by religious faith. This is especially true within the context of American laws. However, it is also the context of just about every society.   Moreover, I believe that social, moral and/or religious conservatives SHOULD have a right to influence policies in their respective local, state and, of course, federal elections. This should include their traditional values too. As long as it doesn't infringe upon protected rights, they should be able to influence the creation of laws that reflect the collective majority consent (guided by morality) of the governed.   I'm a Christian (previously agnostic). So, what if a U.S. city or state has a majority Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, atheist, etc. population (with a morality derived from that majority's beliefs)? Again: I have no problem with majority-derived laws long as it is not an establishment of any particular religion OR a policy/law that infringes of the Constitutional rights of others.   If a city or state wants to offer vouchers to schools that are essentially parochial schools of other faiths -- I would agree.

"Interesting position! So you would argue that the separation of church and state is not something deeply entrenched. That if a majority wills it, a single state or even the country as a whole could adopt one religion as its foundation for morals and even laws. The only restriction you place on this outcome is that no such law or policy may infringe on others' rights.   Here's a couple of concerns in that case. Let's say everyone's okay with immigration. Do you let in people who aren't the majority religion? Let's say everyone agrees with you and that no law should be enacted that is unconstitutional. What's the point of having religion in your government? It can't do anything of significance. Within this schema, what does adding religion to the government accomplish?

"Pt.1   No, I am not saying that at all (not even close).  Rather, I am saying that ""separation of church and state"" is not quite what some people pretend it to be.   The term itself was penned as a result of a private, personal letter from President Jefferson to members of the Danbury Baptist association in 1802. That religious Baptist organization had heard rumors that the United States was going to adapt a national church (kind of like how the ""Anglican Church"" was the national religion of England). Jefferson's letter was a response to that concern.   In his letter, Jefferson wrote:  To messers. Nehemiah Dodge, Ephraim Robbins, & Stephen S. Nelson, a committee of the Danbury Baptist association in the state of Connecticut.  >Gentlemen  >The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist association, give me the highest satisfaction. my duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of the interests of my constituents, & in proportion as they are persuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more pleasing.  >Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ""*make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof*,"" thus **building a wall of separation between Church & State**. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties.  >I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection & blessing of the common father and creator of man, and tender you for yourselves & your religious association, assurances of my high respect & esteem.  >Th Jefferson   Jan. 1. 1802.  [https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html](https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html)  Jefferson reassured these Danbury Baptists that the ""wall of separation between Church and State"" reinforces the ""rights of conscience."" That is, Jefferson quotes the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and then argues that no one can be forced to violate such a conscience -- which is between man and his God -- when it comes to religious exercise.   Jefferson invokes this conscience as a Lockean ""natural right"" (which alludes to wording in both the Jefferson-penned Declaration as well as as his words in the Virginia Statute of Religious Liberty. Such language was often used as a definition definitional term for the Bill of Rights (i.e., being ""natural"" and why the state cannot impede them from ""we the people of the United States"").",chrismireya,2025-05-07T14:32:14,1

As Jefferson noted, that *free exercise* of religion is a matter of conscience that can neither be *forced* (by the state) or *prohibited* (by the state).    Interestingly, while he penned the Declaration and the Virginia Statute for Religious Liberty (two of the three accomplishments listed on Jefferson's self-penned epitaph), Jefferson didn't pen the First Amendment. At the time of his letter to the Danbury Baptists, Jefferson was the third President of the United States. He was serving his first term of office (and the fourth presidential term for the nation).   So, to what extent did Jefferson practice ""separation of church and state?"" Essentially, nearly all schools were ""parochial"" at the time. Even the most secular of schools required Bible teachings and times for prayer in 1800. Both houses of Congress and the Supreme Court opened with prayer by different Christian ministers. Many parts of the federal government and most state governments employed chaplains (which most still do).   Jefferson's silence on such matters could be taken as accepting such practices as not violating his view of that wall between church and state. No one would be forced to participate. No one could be prohibited from participating either.   So, my idea of religious liberty is similar. You cannot force participation. However, there is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits acknowledgment or acceptance of or cooperation and association with religious groups either. As long as the conscience of the individual is not violated, then no one is having their rights infringed.",chrismireya,2025-05-07T14:32:39,1
"Very interesting! And obviously well researched (or good job using AI, difficult to tell these days). How does one measure the violation of an individual's conscience?",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-05-07T14:53:06,1
"Thanks. I'm definitely NOT using AI either. 😎  As for a measurement determining the violation of an individual's conscience: I don't think that there is a way to measure. In fact, there might not be a *need* anyway. Simply put: A person should not be forced to violate their religious conscience.  I suppose that this difference is that it is clear that the state is not married to any religion/religious faith. The United States has no state religion. However, just because we don't have a national language (until the last three months), it didn't mean that state functions couldn't be in multiple languages either.  My point is that the individual right to faith extends to their exercise as well as their choice not to exercise. However, this doesn't mean that expressions of religious faith must be banned from all state functions, documents or meetings either.  Thanksgiving (a day of thanksgiving to God) is rooted back before the foundation of the United States of America. On the other hand, Christmas (celebrating the birth of Christ) has only been an official federal holiday for 155 years (since 1870). However, it had been a state holiday prior to that. Moreover, it has long been celebrated in both private and public (including federal) ways. This has included official state functions.  Using the most stiflingly secular interpretation of Jefferson's ""separation of church and state"" terminology, it has never applied to Christmas as a viable and almost universally-practiced state acknowledgement.  Remember: While the federal government prevented the establishment of a religion (as well as the free exercise of it), the individual states had established religions long after the Constitution was ratified. Most of the original colonies had close and official ties to the Church of England until the 19th Century. Massachusetts had a state religion of ""Congregational Church"" until 1833.  Oddly enough, it was because of Jefferson's Statute for Religious Liberty that Virginia first unattached itself to any ""established"" religion. Yet, even then, the state often had close ties to religious faith and practice. Given the prevailing existence of ""established"" state churches in the U.S. by the time Jefferson mentioned that ""wall,"" it is likely (or, at least, my guess) that Jefferson meant that the 1st Amendment essentially prohibited the federal government from establishing a single, national religion OR prohibiting the individuals from exercising their faith (in private or public) as well as compelling individuals to violate their own religious consciences.",chrismireya,2025-05-07T16:16:04,1
"As for application:  * I don't think that a baker must decorate cakes for LGBTQ weddings. * I don't think that a Buddhist must be forced to participate in Christmas festivities. * I don't think that a Muslim must be forced to decorate a pro-Israel cake. * I don't think that a Jew must be forced to decorate a ""death to Israel"" cake. * I don't think that a Hindu must be forced to decorate a ""celebrate meat eating"" cake. * I don't think that a black family-owned restaurant must be forced to cater a Westboro Baptist Church gathering.  * I don't think that an atheist must be compelled to attend a Christmas party.  I can go even further:  I don't think that a devout religious person should be forced to work on their special holy days (if they were hired without being forced to). This would mean Friday, Saturday, Sunday, etc.   I don't think that a church should be targeted for loss of tax exemption if they mention moral issues or even voting issues from their pulpits. This goes for religious groups that favor either major party (or no parties at all).   I also don't think that a county registrar (working prior to 2015) should have been fired for being unable (due to religious reasons) to sign certifications of marriage for LGBTQ couples following the 5-4 decision in 2015. The state could have accommodated this situation by either transferring that worker to a different office of equal pay/rank or having someone without religious prohibitions from signing them (perhaps an official of higher rank).",chrismireya,2025-05-07T16:27:41,1
