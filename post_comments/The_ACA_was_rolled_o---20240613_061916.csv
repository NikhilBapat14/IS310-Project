"The ACA was not meant to be rolled out on a state by state basis and only one of its provisions, the Medicaid expansion, was.  The only reasons this happened were the Sebelius case ruling that states ""may"" expand Medicaid and the fact that Medicaid, itself, is a state program with a federal match.  The fact that many states still haven't is a disaster for public health. It's not an accomplishment.",lollersauce914,2024-06-13T19:23:19,6
"This is not an accurate representation of the ACA. I think what you mean to say is that one particular provision of the ACA, the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, was rolled out state by state. That's not exactly correct either. The ACA has a lot of moving parts that completely redefined health insurance and access to care, and those parts of the ACA happened as soon as the law went into effect.  But back to Medicaid expansion--recall that in *National Federation of Businesses* *v Sebelius*, SCOTUS ruled that only one part of the ACA was unconstitutional, the part that gave the federal government the authority to tell state-run Medicaid programs how they should define eligibility for those programs. This decision preserved the vast majority of the ACA and left the decision whether or not to expand Medicaid eligibility to the states.  As it turns out, Medicaid expansion was a very good thing, as quickly became apparent from the majority of states that decided to expand in 2014 as planned, and from there, it's basically as you describe. However, there are 10 states that have still not expanded and likely never will so long as they are in the hand of republican legislatures. It's more important to own the libs than to make sure people who need it have health insurance.  This is the fundamental limitation of federalism in polarized political environments. One party has a vested interest in never allowing a policy to succeed no matter how successful it is, simply because it carries the name (Obamacare) of their most hated political enemy in several decades.",iamelben,2024-06-14T06:11:32,3

">However, there are 10 states that have still not expanded and likely never will so long as they are in the hand of republican legislatures.   Some red states recently expanded Medicaid. I think North Carolina is one of the stares that recently expanded Medicaid.",FordMan100,2024-06-15T09:25:08,2

"Democratic Governor Roy Cooper played a big role in that. But in general, yes. Some red states (including 2014 expanders like Ohio and Arizona who were republican-led at the time) expanded. But I sincerely doubt weâ€™ll see movement and conservative power houses like Florida, Texas, and Georgia.",iamelben,2024-06-15T09:29:53,2
