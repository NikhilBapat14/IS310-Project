Anthony never should have gotten out on bail... How he spend the rest of his days in prison for what he did to that family.,Rocket_Surgery83,2025-04-17T17:36:59,72
What I find disgusting is the comments he made about Sarah Fields because he's mad about her reporting on X exposing his grift and shitty past through simple journalism.  I was listening to her speak earlier in an X space and she had to hire private security because of threats she's started receiving because of this piece of trash.  And apparently he hasn't been filing taxes too much and the IRS might be alerted to his activities now thanks to her so that might be part of it.,ponmbr,2025-04-17T22:40:30,17

"Bend the knee ...that's what they want.  Austin was supposed to bend the knee that day too.   In all 15 yrs my sons played baseball, no one from the opposing team ever came over with their bag to our team's dugout.  Hubris.   And there was ample room in the covered tunnels under the bleachers just feet from the tents to get out of any rain.",Cool_Addendum_1348,2025-04-18T10:51:54,5
"Agree,💯%❗️  I've seen domestic violence (with no deaths) and the perpetrator is in jail for months.  This is a killing and a death, and the perpetrator is out of jail in days.  Just unreal how the justice system has become under leftists.👀",GiediOne,2025-04-17T19:20:50,31
