"And the lesson that Republicans will learn from this incident is:  Dispute every election in court. Every single one, no matter how ludicrous. Because it has three advantages:  1) Republicans might get lucky and draw a GOP MAGA hack judge like Aileen Cannon who is willing to collude to steal an election from Democrats.  2) Even if they don't win, Republicans can tie up an election loss in protracted court battles, enabling a sitting Republican to hold the seat for a long time after losing the election.  3) Even if it isn't protracted, fighting elections in court and fucking up the process feeds the GOP narrative about elections being untrustworthy, which provides all sorts of advantages for the big-picture GOP agenda of demolishing American democracy and replacing it with GOP fascism in perpetuity.  And... there are no repercussions to losing. Literally none. They have no shame or honor to be tainted; their voters don't care even the tiniest bit; and the cost of the legal process isn't borne by the candidate but by the GOP, which is backed by Murdoch and Musk and Koch and DeVos and a shitload of other grotesquely wealthy hacks who are perfectly happy to fund GOP junkets that advance their vision of America.",reckless_commenter,2025-05-07T12:15:06,658

Everyone should absolutely be doing this to unabashed bigots. It's what they want. Make them squirm.   You got a Republican congressperson in your town that loves talking about pronouns? Fuck up their preferred pronouns everytime.,russellarth,2025-05-07T12:56:34,57

"Ahh yes, a problem most *eloquently* summarized by Douglas Adams:  *The major problem‚Äîone of the major problems, for there are several‚Äîone of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them. To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.*  It is a real conundrum tbh.",jakktrent,2025-05-07T13:49:27,15

"I know you don't like it, I understand entirely your position about it. But the reality is, unfortunately, these people *are* human. People are capable of great cruelty and atrocities. I used to say the same about Hitler. Hitler was not a monster. Hitler was a human, the basest human with the worst of our impulses, desires, and beliefs...but very much human. Dehumanization is a path leads to exactly what you hate. It's not the high road, it's a necessary step to avoid succumbing to those same human flaws.",ThinkyRetroLad,2025-05-08T07:38:34,1
