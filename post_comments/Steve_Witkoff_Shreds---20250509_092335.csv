"When someone says the media is lying and is actually being represented by the media, how do you determine who in fact is lying.  Do you even bother to read what's happening to people?  Do you even care?  Go outside talk to people, read books.  Talk to veterans who actually understand why we need to value our constitution, because they have seen the world outside those protections.  You keep posting the same maga news nonsense and have nothing else to say in regards to the other side of that.  You're not doing well even slightly changing anyone's opinion, what you're doing is further brainwashing yourself into believing it.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T09:39:14,5
