"American consumers are not yet seeing much evidence of the drastic changes President Trump has made on trade. But they are on their way.  When the Covid pandemic hit, factories in China shut down and global shipping traffic slowed. Within a matter of a few weeks, products began disappearing from U.S. store shelves and American firms that depend on foreign materials were going out of business.  A similar trend is beginning to play out, but this time the catalyst is President Trump’s decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent, an amount so steep that much of the trade between the United States and China has ground to a halt. Fewer massive container ships have been plying the ocean between Chinese and American ports, and in the coming weeks, far fewer Chinese goods will arrive on American shores.  While high tariffs on Chinese products have been in place since early April, the availability of Chinese products and the price that consumers pay for them has not changed that much. But some companies are now starting to raise their prices. And experts say that the effects will become more and more obvious in the coming weeks, as a tidal wave of change stemming from canceled orders in Chinese factories works its way around the world to the United States.  The number of massive container ships carrying metal boxes of toys, furniture and other products departing China for the United States plummeted by about a third in April.  The reason consumers haven’t felt many of the effects yet is because it takes 20 to 40 days for a container ship to travel across the Pacific Ocean. It then takes another one to 10 days for Chinese goods to make their way by train or truck to various cities around the country, economists at Apollo Global Management wrote in a recent report. That means that the higher tariffs on China that went into effect at the beginning of April are just starting to result in a drop in the number of ships arriving at American ports, a trend that should intensify.  By late May or early June, consumers could start to see some empty shelves, and layoffs could occur for retailers and logistics industries. The major effects on the U.S. economy of shutting down trade with China will start to become apparent in the summer of 2025, when the United States might slip into a recession, said Torsten Slok, an economist at Apollo.",acct_removed,2025-05-03T20:24:25,102

We need the market crash to happen soon enough that the full impacts - unemployment, retirement savings loss, home loss, difficulty finding good work after because all profits are going to shareholders - are felt between early to mid fall this year and mid to late summer next year. The initial crash happening this fall would mean Dems would likely have brutal primaries, which would actually result in the party moving left and back to the working class party. And that would give them time to communicate their policies head to head against maga to show that one is fake populism, and one is real with the intent to help people.

And he is already deporting US Citizens and sending them to prisons on foreign soil with no due process.   I wish I had your optimism but I think if the economy experiences a calamitic turn that the US will end up far worst for it. Trump won't step down. He doesn't want to go to jail. And he has shown he will gladly defy the Supreme Court, and arrest Judges.   If you think things are bad now try to remember we are only like 4 months in.

"The US used to pride itself on customers not getting screwed; holding shopkeepers accountable to maintaining accurate pricing on-shelf.   States have largely defunded price gouging enforcement and price discrepancies anyway.  I long for the days when managers managed their store better and were held accountable.   I seem to think around 2012, a number of retailers including Grocery chains and WalMart stopped offering a company policy where pricing on the shelf would match at the register.   If a price was higher at the register, customers would receive an additional 50% (or more) of the price difference; depending on company policy.   I remember trying to get the correct price once and the store manager actually invited a lawsuit.  I wrote a letter to corporate (stating she’d invite a lawsuit over $1.25 price difference) and haven’t seen that store manager since.   In the past 2 years, many major retailers like WalMart and BestBuy have transitioned to electronic price tags, which connect wirelessly and update pricing with a few clicks on a keyboard.

Things were bleak enough that in 1932 the Allies decided to pause German reparations, and for the Nazis part of the gain was the various governing coalitions after 1928 consisted of essentially the entire rest of the political spectrum.  1933 Germany had a dystopian economic outlook that was extremely easy to lay at the feet of the people who had run the country for the last five years.
