"The white population of the Northeast is far less likely to be evangelical protestant than elsewhere and more likely to be secular.  Among those in the Northeast who have a faith, it is also more likely to be Catholic.  Some Catholics are extremely conservative, but others are quite liberal.  Evangelical whites skew heavily Republican.  Secular whites skew heavily Democratic.",I405CA,2025-04-10T17:40:35,177
"One of the factors is that progressivism as a political movement is actually rooted in the old-school Protestant churches of New England, such as the Unitarians, Methodists, and Episcopalians, who preach about collective service to the community and helping your neighbors through charity and good works.  This tradition still exists in rural Maine, although southern Baptist style evangelicals are starting to overtake traditional WASPs in numbers in these parts.  Our farmers are as likely to be ""back to land-ers"" and organic granolas as they are to be MAGA.",megavikingman,2025-04-10T17:36:55,300
"It’s mostly because New England doesn’t really have many rural areas in the traditional sense.  Rural areas imply like true disconnection from the metro area.  What New England has is a lot of little quaint towns, where large percentages of the people commute from them to office parks on the outskirts of like Boston. Don’t let the population densities of those small towns fool you - Google the property values. Look at how far out the commuter rail in Boston goes.  The areas that you think are “rural” because they’re much farther away from the cities are the sparsely populated northeastern part of Connecticut, or the northern western part of Massachusetts, or Vermont just outside Burlington, or southern RI.  Except, guess what:  That’s where the big state universities are located. That’s UConn, UMass / Holyoke / Amherst, UVM, and URI respectively.

The major NH newspaper, The Manchester Union Leader was run by William Loeb, who was so far right, he barely tolerated Richard Nixon. Calvin Coolidge came from VT.

"There are three main flows of people that colonized the US and the Americas.  1) the Spanish came to loot and pillage. They exploited the local populations for their own gain. There was no hint of freedom or fairness, typical liberal ideas. Corruption continues to be rampant in the areas they conquered.  2) the Southern part of the US was colonized by people who were told that the local population would be glad to work as slaves. Slaves were made of the local population and were also imported from Africa. The only fairness was for the rulers, the slaves had none. Discrimination based on race is still rampant there.  3) the Northeast was colonized by people who came to be free. Free to worship as they felt, freedom to create their own government, freedom from the Kings that ruled them before. That push for freedom is still present and manifests as politically liberal.",billpalto,2025-04-11T09:51:53,6
"I’m from New Hampshire and currently live in Florida. I teach at a charter school and my public school blew this place away in terms of expectations. However, I think more importantly, the lineage of most people couldn’t be traced back to confederate or proud southern behavior. I’m not even saying racist, I just think the idea of being a “true American” has a completely different connotation up north than it does in the south. We put an emphasis on acceptance, a melting pot, celebrating differences, maybe that stems from New York City and thinking of the country of a place where people from all over come, to people who think of isolationism is the answer to most problems.   I had a friend who went to LSU for a semester and he told me when he went up to a group of black students they asked him why he doesn’t just go hang out with the white guys. He was kinda confused but he said later he found there was more emphasis put on color and differences.   I don’t think you can generalize any region though. I know some very MAGA people from my area, even in my family, while my family in Florida ironically is way more liberal.

"I’m from Maine, and I only recently found out I live in a “rural area” when applying for a scholarship—I’d never really thought of it that way. But rural New England doesn’t feel like the kind of rural that gets talked about nationally when people bring up political divides. I see a bunch of comments about  how NE has higher education rates; none of my family went to college, I am the first one (proud to be majoring in journalism). But it. I think, maybe, our education is different?   Growing up, the version of America I was taught emphasized tolerance, immigration, and the idea of a shared identity. Every year in history class, we heard how this country was a melting pot—how people from all over came here in search of something better. Patriotism was framed as standing up for fairness and for “the little guy.” We studied the Revolution a lot, and we were taught to be proud of New England’s early abolition of slavery (I know there are… Issues with that, but, as a whole, it was always framed that NE is more tolerant). My elementary school even had a whole day where we’d dress up as ancestors who came on the Mayflower or through Ellis Island and celebrate becoming Americans together.  We also learned about what settlers did to Indigenous people. There was a sense that our identity, our culture, came from being aware of both the ideals and the injustices.  My family are Trump supporters—but their beliefs are still grounded in this idea that if someone works hard and contributes to society, they deserve to be here. Everyone I know who voted for Trump did it because of taxes or money stuff. There’s just a different flavor to conservatism here, from my experience, and being liberal just. Makes more sense in terms of the American values. That’s what I feel and hear from others in my community.",purplebasil-1234,2025-04-15T19:12:11,1

Their whole conversation made my blood boil because they clearly had no respect for the people they were trying to convert. They talked about them as if they were inferior and they were targeting older people because they felt like they’d be more easily converted.,Ozymandias12,2025-04-10T21:16:55,45

I find the more they learn they end up dropping the conservative mentality but regardless will still vote R because they are too interested in what happens in someone’s bedroom. At least from my experience,ChartIntelligent6320,2025-04-10T20:27:06,8

"Upstate really shows the level of inequality that there is In America, as well as how it ties in with race   The suburbs have some of the best schools in the country.  Then you go a mile away in the city district just over an imaginary line, it's a completely different animal.  This is true for pretty much all the large Metro areas along the Erie canal.

"I’m not counting Montreal, as it is a different country. While a lot of people may travel there who live close to the border, the majority of people are not commuting from rural Vermont or Maine to Montreal OR Boston to work. Southern New Hampshire residents often commute to Boston, but that’s about as far as it usually goes.  You’re absolutely right about the lack of population in a lot of Maine and parts of New Hampshire, though. And the tourism is definitely a part of it as well, although a lot less so for Maine than for NH and VT.  While the distance to some major cities helps, I don’t think the proximity can be given all of the credit for those places being more liberal. The history of places like Vermont being much more progressive than the rest of the country goes back to before Vermont was part of the US. The Republic of Vermont outlawed slavery once it was created after the Revolutionary War and before it ever even joined the US in 1791.",ProfessorSputin,2025-04-11T16:06:48,1
"Evangelicalism predates the 70s—technically, it goes back to the 1700s—but yes, what we've come to know as ""Evangelicals"" comes from the mid-late 20th century. I also know there's lots of variety within their church, I grew up in it.   I don't know why you took my question about whether they've deviated enough from the rest of Protestants to warrant getting their own label alongside Protestants and Catholics as ""mocking"" them. Robert P. Jones of PRRI distinguishes between ""mainline Protestants"" and ""evangelical Protestants"" in his writing, and I've wondered for a while why we don't just say ""Protestants"" and ""Evangelicals."" At some point, it made sense to say ""Catholics"" and ""Protestants"", and before that, ""Orthodox"" and ""Catholic"".  What is the threshold past which a denomination becomes its own subset? For example, when you say ""Protestants"", are you also referring to Mormons? Or do Mormons get their own subset?",seancurry1,2025-04-15T10:11:26,2

"That claim is disproven by a single conversation with any conservative.   Also, the abstract you linked to acknowledges up-front that the statement can only be considered correct under certain conditions and if you ignore a ton of other factors - like, for example, calling billionaires ""donating"" to their own tax-exempt ""foundations"" where they employ their own children ""charity.""
