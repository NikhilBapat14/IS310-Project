"Fuck Scientific American.  I subscribed to that mag for over 3 decades, then a few years ago, a left side behind, and went full on woke.    And of *course* the headline makes this sound different than reality.  “National Science Foundation staff were told to freeze outgoing funding days after NSF leadership introduced a new policy that requires that grants be screened for “alignment with agency priorities”  So it’s a freeze until they have new management, policies and procedures in place.  This is S.O.P. for the corporate world and yes, government agencies and absolutely for foundations.  This is a nothing burger. Shame on Scientific American.",cliffotn,2025-05-03T02:53:52,19

To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:14:22,2
Some of these projects are disturbing animal torture too. Fuck them. I read one study where they had animals raped recently to examine the effects of a drug.,kaytin911,2025-05-03T03:03:32,-8
