A question for Van Hollen-- has he ever visited with an American that thought they were being screwed over by the judicial system or just this once with a foreigner? It'd go a long way to show his motivations.,covfefe_cove,2025-04-17T20:21:58,247

"I just posted this in another sub about this story. Expecting to be banned for it...  Time for a controversial take, because sometimes it's fun to play devil's advocate...  The fact he's alive and (relatively?) well makes it much more likely the Trump Admins story is true and he's a member of MS-13. If he were just a normal parent who fled El Salvador to escape gang violence and lived in America raising his 3 kids and working as a contractor, he wouldn't last in a prison like CECOT.  Now, a member of a notoriously violent gang who was deported and imprisoned with 14(?) of his fellow gang members... They would have a much higher chance of surviving and getting out with minimal damage...  I'm honestly happy he's alive, but I don't expect it to matter. Even if they send him back to the US, all they'll do is hold a hearing, find him guilty, and send him right back. Hell, he's not even being held in a foreign country like most of the people Trump sent there, he got deported back to his home country. There is very little hope it won't just happen again.",MasterOfPupets,2025-04-17T21:55:07,11
