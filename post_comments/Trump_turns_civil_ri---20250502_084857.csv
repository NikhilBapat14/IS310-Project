"Well, this is frightening.  >The Department of Justice division created by the landmark 1957 Civil Rights Act to defend American’s rights has a new mission: rooting out anti-Christian bias, antisemitism and “woke ideology,” the head of the division, Harmeet Dhillon, [recently told](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/politics/justice-department-civil-rights-division-resignations) conservative commentator Glenn Beck.  I'm wondering how long before Jews become anti-Christian in the administration's view.",DrHugh,2025-05-02T08:52:47,88
"I am an atheist, I don't believe in any gods. Is that anti-christian to the fascist Trump America.

"""Exposing anti-Christian bias and being ‘anti-woke’ is in.""     Why would they care since none of the Trump/MAGA crowd are Christians?

"The reason this move will be supported by most conservatives is they've been given the message for decades that the work of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was completed long ago. They've also been told since at least the 80s that the pendulum somehow swung too far the other way. The GOP messaging is that all the hardships suffered by middle and working-working class white Americans aren't the result their terrible policies creating wealth disparity, etc- NO, it's really because a bunch of egg-head bureaucrats gave everything away to minorities who didn't deserve it. This message morphed into an even uglier one that said Democrats are actively holding back white Christians in favor of others because they HATE them. We're only seeing the beginning of how destructive this distorted victim complex will get on its way out.",Anthemic_Fartnoises,2025-05-02T09:21:22,5

"The key is they are doing a new version of state sponsored discrimination.

From a different article but to the point.  >What its advocates want is not a restoration of explicit Jim Crow segregation—that would shatter the illusion that their own achievements are based in a color-blind meritocracy. They want an arrangement that perpetuates racial inequality indefinitely while retaining some plausible deniability, a rigged system that maintains a mirage of equal opportunity while maintaining an unofficial racial hierarchy. Like elections in authoritarian countries where the autocrat is always reelected in a landslide, they want a system in which they never risk losing but can still pretend they won fairly.....When Trump officials speak of a society that is color-blind and merit-based, they do not appear to mean meritocracy or color-blindness in the traditional sense. Instead of individual meritocracy, they seem to be advocating a racial meritocracy, in which the merit of an individual hire or admission can be assessed not by their individual accomplishments but by how well the group they are associated with fits a particular role.
