"I recommend everyone stop using AI willingly and grow a beautiful flower garden, landscape, and/or grow your own food. It connects you to reality in a way we all need.",Front-Lime4460,2025-05-03T20:34:09,37
"""The phone eats time; it makes us live the way people do inside a casino, dropping a blackout curtain over the windows to block out the world, except the blackout curtain is a screen, showing too much of the world, too quickly. As Richard Seymour writes in the book ‚ÄúThe Twittering Machine,‚Äù this avoidance of time‚Äôs actual flow, this compulsion toward the chronophage, the time-eater, is a horror story that is likely to happen only ‚Äúin a society that is busily producing horrors.‚Äù  But now reality wants‚Äîone feels‚Äîto eat time, too. For example: ten days before he was sworn in, Trump had been sentenced to unconditional discharge on¬†thirty-four felony counts¬†of falsifying business records. But I don‚Äôt really remember that, nor do I understand whether it mattered. I do remember Day One of his Presidency, when he¬†renamed the Gulf of Mexico, and also signed¬†executive orders¬†to end birthright citizenship, to restore the federal death penalty, and to razor out anything that gives off a whiff of D.E.I. Same with day five, when he fired the watchdogs, ordered the government to stop investigating book bans, and suggested shutting down¬†FEMA; also day ten, when he announced plans to move migrants to Guant√°namo and claimed, without evidence, that the U.S. had sent fifty million dollars‚Äô worth of condoms to Gaza. *But there have been ninety more such days and counting, the events of each seeming inconceivable as they materialize in headlines and then are swiftly carried to the purgatorial cognitive landfill of things that have not been fully absorbed or processed or fought against but have been pressed into reality, where they will remain as the fading backdrop of each day‚Äôs new, grotesque parade.*""  Much of this article resonated with me.  Not just the parts about politics, and how the speed and frequency of each moment's bullshit (for lack of a better word) eclipses our collective ability to mount a response.  The latter sections on how dispiriting and dehumanizing tech and especially AI tech have become too ... The blurring of bots/AI slop/a never ending stream of algorithmically generated content into every facet of daily life... it all feels so dystopian and isolating.",StephenSwolebear,2025-05-03T21:20:20,11

"I found the article tortured and overwrought in the way that I find I get when I haven't slept. She mentions that she has two young children. It may actually be sleep deprivation that broke her brain. And a ""passion for marijuana"" isn't helping either.

"It started out very poignant, and it felt like there was a point to the article in the beginning, but it kinda just rambled from Trump to Isreal to AI and really just felt like an old man complaining about a future (understandable), but offering nothing to take away except misery and despair. ¬†No hope for the future, no call to make things better. ¬†Just a defeatist, 'sigh, everything sucks and is horrible now; guess I'll refresh my phone' kinda vibe. ¬†I really feel for the author and totally understand the perspective, however I also kinda wished I hadn't read it. ¬†Despite being beautifully written, it felt like reading erotica, but for depression.",putdownthekitten,2025-05-04T12:36:58,1

"I feel though that disjointed writing style gave cadence to the story that the author wanted to share. That misery and despair was better brought across with a struggle to grasp at any part of the ramble in specific. This piece is in the perspective of someone who is struggling to grasp an understanding of the world at large; this is something we all share right now. It is truly difficult to grasp at this point any understanding of the forest we are all in the trees. If anyone at this point isn't seeing trees, they have their head firmly planted in the dirt.",stonedtarzan,2025-05-04T21:17:29,1
