"Nyet Means Nyet: Russia’s NATO Enlargement Redlines, February 1, 2008.  “Classified By: Ambassador William J. Burns: Following a muted first reaction to  Ukraine's intent to seek a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP)  at the Bucharest summit, Foreign Minister Lavrov and  other senior officials have reiterated strong opposition,  stressing that Russia would view further eastward expansion  as a potential military threat.  NATO enlargement,  particularly to Ukraine, remains ""an emotional and neuralgic""  issue for Russia, but strategic policy considerations also  underlie strong opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and  Georgia.  In Ukraine, these include fears that the issue  could potentially split the country in two, leading to  violence or even, some claim, civil war, which would force  Russia to decide whether to intervene.“  This was your former CIA Director Biden so shut your damn mouth!

"Biden's legacy is that he was told explicitly by the supreme court that he had the power to stop fascism and he chose not to do it because it would be rude. He was worthless.

[Putin doesn't believe Ukraine is a real country.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/opinion/ukraine-war-national-identity.html) He invaded because he wants his legacy to be a restoration of the former Russian Empire.  Blaming it on anything else is feeding right into his hands.,TheIllustriousWe,2025-05-07T09:54:20,1
"At least Biden is able to explain the executive orders and bills that he signed. Trump is surrounded by sycophantic goons who shove executive orders in front of him, getting him to sign after a few sentences about how great it will make America.   I get that most voters just see that Biden is old and it kills the vibes or whatever, but he often made the right moves with policy. But at the end of the day politics is all messaging and you can't argue with  Biden's rapid decline in that regard. It is a double standard though, since Trump has a 100 word vocabulary and says crazy shit every single time he speaks, but he seems to dodge mainstream criticism for that.  I'd take another 4 years with the Biden cabinet, minus Merrick Garland.",VoodooPandaGaming,2025-05-07T17:12:27,6
"Putin doesn't believe Ukraine is a real country. He invaded because he wants his legacy to be a restoration of the former Russian Empire.  Blaming it on anything else is feeding right into his hands.  “Putin doesn't believe Ukraine is a real country.”  By that he means a homogenous state with a single identity, he made that known back in 2008 ‘Ukraine is not even a state! What is Ukraine? A part of its territory is in Eastern Europe, but another part, a considerable one, was a gift from us!” Here he’s referring to the Southeastern parts where the conflict is raging that have more Russian speakers/ethnic Russians.  Which in the early 1920s Lenin arbitrarily allocated those lands from Russia to Ukraine, Putin spoke about this in 2018 and how it planted a time bomb in the Soviet state and laid the foundation for the ongoing crisis.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/25/vladmir-putin-accuses-lenin-of-placing-a-time-bomb-under-russia   https://gulfnews.com/amp/story/world%2Feurope%2Fputin-denounces-soviet-founder-lenin-1.1660012   https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/vladimirputindonbassandukraine.htm  Western media likes to interpret things like this in a narrow-minded way to fit their narrative/agenda, admittedly he probably should’ve made it more clear that he meant Ukraine as a state with a unified national identity.  “He invaded because he wants his legacy to be a restoration of the former Russian Empire.”  Please provide the quote where he says he wants his legacy to be the restoration of the Russian Empire.   “Blaming it on anything else is feeding right into his hands.”  By ignoring the contents of the text of the cable I quoted in my original comment you’re excusing the role played by the West in fueling this crisis. You’re also deliberately trying to narrow the conversation because you seemingly don’t want to entertain an opposing point of view.  Whether you like it or not, this issue is extremely complex and nuanced, not black & white and Western media attempting to paint it as such makes them extremely disingenuous and duplicitous.",Outrageous-Feed3277,2025-05-07T12:04:05,1
There’s only nuance to be found if you’re trying to in some way excuse or justify Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. I’m not going to do that because I know better than to take a tyrant at his word.  Russia is clearly the aggressor in this war. The only ones who can’t see that are those who hate the West so much that they automatically assume the enemy of their enemy is somehow their friend.,TheIllustriousWe,2025-05-07T12:21:49,1
"You’ve now demonstrated that you’re not interested in rational conversation, the fact that you didn’t address any of the points I made is even more telling, so I’m done. Go take your emotionally based and overly simplistic arguments elsewhere.",Outrageous-Feed3277,2025-05-07T13:05:27,1
"There's nothing to address, really. You believe this issue is nuanced because you believe Putin when he says he no choice but to invade Ukraine in defense of his own country. Like I said, I'm not going to take a tyrant at his word. Sorry if that makes me ""irrational.""",TheIllustriousWe,2025-05-07T13:17:12,1
