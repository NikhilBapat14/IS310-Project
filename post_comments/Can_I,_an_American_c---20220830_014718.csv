"You don't have a congressman to represent you, so no. You can only vote in countrywide at large elections such as the presidency. Unlike military personnel, you don't even have a state of residency since you've never resided in the US.  Being that you've never even lived in the United States, ethically you should simply opt out of its politics.",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-08-30T12:02:51,6
I think you’re required to have residency to vote in an election but I’m not an expert in this,Coleman013,2022-08-30T15:09:11,1
"Do you have any address at all? Income tax? Is that possible: you must pay US taxes on any funds subject to thresholds for any income? Do you use a U.S. debit card or something? Do you get mail at a family member?  Basically you’re arguing you are a resident somewhere to the state, not the US. You need to convince a state you are a resident. Like your parents have residency. You don’t say: I have no plans to ever go there obviously.",[deleted],2022-08-30T23:18:16,1
I'm not really sure what you're asking here. The way an overseas voter is by absentee ballot. You can fill that out and mail it back no matter where you are. What about the vacation makes this any different?,mormagils,2022-08-31T09:05:43,1
The easiest solution is to have a friend collect your mail and forward the ballot to an address you can pick it up from. Then mail it back to the US from where ever you are.,Shakezula84,2022-08-31T19:07:25,1
"Go to www.votefromabroad.org and register. At the end they will give you the contact info for your local electoral office. Depending on what state you vote in, you can probably still request a ballot to vote from abroad.",Worldly_Treat_8990,2022-10-14T17:26:43,1
"There are no 'countrywide at large elections' in the U.S. Remember, you don't vote for the President in the U.S. You vote for a slate of electors. Thus, you must be a resident of a place that *has* electors (a state or D.C.).",ViskerRatio,2022-08-30T12:13:58,6
"If you've registered to vote, you can request an absentee ballot. The rules to that vary by state, so that would require you to check with the state you're registered to vote in. There's usually a strict cut off time of when your ballot can be received in order to be counted.",scubafork,2022-08-30T15:55:06,2
"I know for a fact that I can vote in the midterms as an overseas voter, I already registered.",stanleythedog,2022-08-31T00:47:18,2
"Cause AFAIK I'm supposed to get the ballot mailed to my current address automatically, so that'll be an issue if I'm abroad. How might I get a ballot and mail it while abroad?",stanleythedog,2022-08-31T09:13:12,1
"Ok, that makes sense. It doesn't matter where I mail it from, as long as the ballot is legit and it reaches where it's supposed to?",stanleythedog,2022-09-01T00:19:32,3
Make sure you request the ballot be sent to your email address.,Worldly_Treat_8990,2022-10-14T17:27:46,1
It varies by state. Some say you can only vote for Federal elections. Some use the parents last address to put you into a district as well. Either way a US citizen who has never resided in the US can at least still vote in national elections using their parents last State as the voting area (and therefore vote for that states electors).,Shakezula84,2022-08-31T19:11:27,1
So request an absentee ballot from your state. That’s normal as is armed forces and diplomatic mail for states. Or call the consulate directly and ask for assistance with voting. They have a consular section that exists for this exact work.,[deleted],2022-08-31T02:12:07,1
"Ah, I see. Can you get your mail forwarded? Can you request it earlier? Can you have a friend open your mail and send that onward to you? This isn't really a question for the US electoral system. Their solution is to send you a ballot. This is a question for local postal system.",mormagils,2022-08-31T09:36:54,1
As far as I know. Worst case is they reach out to you to verify someone didn't steal your ballot. I would recommend reaching out to the elections office you are registered to know for sure.,Shakezula84,2022-09-01T00:24:29,1
"Ok, thanks!",stanleythedog,2022-09-01T00:25:51,1
