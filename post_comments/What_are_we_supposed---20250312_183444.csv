"I don't think I've ever heard Trump deliver a joke. Like a normal joke, one with a setup and a punchline. He says weird things constantly, and other people claim later he was joking, but I have never heard him say anything that sounded like a joke in the moment.",Rezart_KLD,2025-03-13T02:24:03,48
"They are trial balloons. If there's lots of pushback, he was just joking. But he repeats it over and over again until it become normal and in far right circles they start saying it seriously. He's already also doing it with 2028 election.  **Never believe anyone on the right - they are all liars.** Remember they said he was joking about not respecting the results of the 2020 election.  They are all liars.  He is always serious - and just wrapping it in a joke if people get too angry, this time. He's just waiting for the people on the right to get used to the idea and the press to exhaust everyone reacting to it.  He is desperate for some permanent, monumental legacy through a giant land grab of some sort. He's floated way too damn many of them.  **He is absolutely not joking about it. He wants a 4th Reich and to make an indisputable landmark move.**",Dell_Hell,2025-03-12T22:24:52,204
"Can't speak for the other branches, but in the Marine Corps, custom is if the commanding officer says ""I wish...."" or something to the same effect, it is to be interpreted as an order to make that happen. Trump, being THE commanding officer, should have everything he says taken at face value unless it is 110% a joke with no room for interpretation as anything else.

"It took awhile to figure out this guy and his strategies.   Here’s the facts:   1. He will use the left’s ability to be easily appalled by distracting them by saying or doing something appalling and then…  2. Then he will continue doing whatever policy he was really focusing on doing, with no meaningful opposition because everyone (including the media) are focused on the appalling thing.   That is 100% his entire method. And understanding it helps.   If you want to know what the number 2 thing is (the policy strategy) then you simply have to read what his lead economic advisors have been saying. It’s helpful to start with reading the [economic manifesto](https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf) of Trump’s pick as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran. It was written in November and appears to be precisely what this Admin has been following as a blueprint with using the carrot/stick method of strong-arming our allies with tariffs.   It’s 41 pages, and at least provides insight into what the fuck is going on right now. The policy is to tie security with the economy, meaning that America will make countries acquiesce to economic demands in exchange for continued security under the American military umbrella.   The policy sounds ludicrous in so many ways, and the only way it can be achieved is if the Fed plays along and other countries don’t [retaliate by using our debt as leverage.](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-trade-war-will-be-disastrous-in-the-long-term-by-kenneth-jacobs-2025-03)   Either way, this entire thing is a gamble with the livelihoods and retirement accounts of all Americans, and the manner in which it’s being done is unethical, in my view, because it’s not being explained to the public. You have to read an obscure 41 page pdf written months ago by his economic advisor to see what the fuck is going on, which nobody in the media is doing, and which most economists in the mainstream are not doing either.",CaspinLange,2025-03-13T02:09:46,24

And then that same person says that same horrible joke around a different group of people who find it funny because they are shitty, and all of a sudden the joke becomes very real.

"> I still have people telling me that Trump is just ""using a negotiating tactic"" with Canada despite both Canada and Trump underscoring that Trump is serious.  For me, the simple answer to that is ""when we negotiate with our allies by threatening total war, we stop having allies that trust us and we will continue to pay for that with interest in ALL future negotiations""  One thing that made our allies trust us is how we avoided being the bully in the play yard with them despite being the biggest kid in school.    So if Trump isn't serious, he's literally damaging international relations as a troll.  If he is being serious, it's even worse EXCEPT that the rest of the world will see how we never actually follow-through with those threats and will suddenly lose respect for us.  If he's being serious and intends to follow through (luckily, we haven't seen follow-through on big stuff so far), we'll end up in an open war with every country that we could ever trust or rely on.  But I think some of the folks in Trump's camp are okay with that because then Democrats can't come in and fix things in 4 years.",novagenesis,2025-03-13T06:58:51,3

"Everything is serious. Literally everything Trump says is serious, none of it is joking. He's not a comedian.  Sometimes he mocks people, and when he does that, he is serious. Sometimes he says things that are so out of touch with reality that they seem like an attempt at absurdist humor, and when he does that, he is serious. Sometimes he says things that seem completely unrealistic, and when he does that, he is serious.  So when people defend Trump by saying ""he wasn't serious"", just calmly reply that ""he was serious"". They have no way to back up the claim that we shouldn't take Trump at his word. He does *lie*, all the time, but that's not the same thing as not meaning what he says.  Or just don't engage with people over whether Trump is right or wrong.

Ask about consequences not being discussed like how businesses are going to treat a country that changes trade rules every 4 years. What about this attracts business to the US? Does this encourage our top partners to grow their trade with us, or look elsewhere? What does this do to our reputation. Make the conversation about something other than his exact words.

He’s a moron who stumbled his way through many failed businesses.   And as others said, every statement he makes publicly needs to be treated as the official position of the President of the United States. Treating it as anything less only belittles the importance and seriousness of the office. Saying he’s going to take Greenland by any means necessary should be construed as a threat, and acted on accordingly.

"Trump is an aspiring mob boss bully.  He wants to be able to beat up people, then have them thank him for the punishment.  In negotiating terms, he is a maximalist.  He takes extreme positions and hangs onto them, not attempting to find middle ground.  As the mob boss in training, he combines maximalism with bullying.    This is what we saw with Trump, Vance and Zelansky, with Trump astonished that he could not cram a deal down Zelensky's throat and get his gratitude in return.  Trump is a lousy negotiator.  Bullies only respect force.  So they will dominate you out of a sense of entitlement, but also acquiesce if they feel that the other side has the advantage.  Oddly enough, bullies respect the pecking order in both directions.  These people are easily defeated if the tactic is understood.  Looking north to Canada, the right-wing Doug Ford is doing a better job with this than is the liberal Mark Carney.  While Carney is turning Trump into a representation of US values, Ford is personalizing it about Trump and pointing out to Americans that Trump is harming them with bad policies.    Dividing and conquering the enemy is always the best approach.  It is wisest to isolate Trump, not to view him as a voice for the country.  His approval ratings are falling fast and it would be wise to target GOP-led purple districts in order to find voices within in his own party who may turn on him for the sake of their political survival.",I405CA,2025-03-13T06:57:30,2
"Canadian here.  The one argument \*against\* taking this talk of a ""51st state"" seriously is that we'd be a very big (roughly California), very blue and very pissed off state who just lost their health insurance.  As such the GOP can't possibly want us to vote in US elections.  I don't know why there isn't more discussion of this.  We are, however, wondering what the other possibilities are.  To be economically crushed and squeezed until we agree to become a territory like Guam or Puerto Rico?  A vassal state like Belarus? An exploited resource colony like the Congo under Leopold?  (one writer described trade between Congo and Belgium as ""rubber and other resources going one way, bullets and occupying soldiers the other"")  (I don't think the US would actually invade Canada, as it's not clear to me that the US military would obey such an order... unless Trump manufactures some kind of Reichstag/9\_11 incident and blames Canada for it)  (some might argue we always were a vassal state, but my view was that up until now, the United States was the primary defender of the Liberal International Order, and Canada was happy to be allied with that.  But now? I can tell you right now that we don't recognize this United States and we absolutely do not want to be allied with it or have anything to do with it.  Unfortunately due to population and geography we are in a very vulnerable position, far worse than Ukraine for example.  Canada's national nightmare has just come true).",DarrenX,2025-03-13T07:01:31,2

"I've read where people insist that Donald Trump's detractors listen to what he is saying and can't tell if he's serious or not, because so much of what he says sounds outright crazy or just stupid. But his supporters don't listen to what he says, and take him very seriously.   I'm not sure how much of that I subscribe to, but I think there's an element of truth there. His supporters don't worry about what's coming out of his mouth, because they have faith in him. That's not a logic driven view. On the other hand, anybody who is actually listening to what he's saying, or observing his actions, sees a babbling idiot given to emotionally driven decisions, who clearly doesn't see any difference between his own personal agenda, and what the nation's policies should be. This is why something as objectionable as the President of the United States standing on the White House lawn trying to sell cars for his biggest donor, is acceptable in his eyes. What's good for Donald or lucrative for Donald, is good for the country. This is the thinking of autocrats and monarchs. He is the country, the country is him.   And this is why he's doing the hokey-pokey with tariffs. If he likes the way a country treats him personally (Mexico), he eases the tariffs. If he feels like a country isn't obsequious enough (Canada), he implements more tariffs. Whether that country props up his ego or not is the rubric for making national trade policy decisions. That's insane and I'm inclined to take it very seriously.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-03-13T07:21:36,2
"Trump is a fraud. He has been found to be a fraud in court numerous times. His company has been found guilty of criminal fraud, the CFO went to prison. Trump owes hundreds of millions in damages for fraud, he was lying about the value of his properties to scam the banks.  So how do you tell when he is joking or when he is lying? Or is he telling the truth? (that seems to be rare).  The simple fact is that nothing Trump says should be taken seriously, except perhaps his threats.

That’s not to say he’s not serious about destroying our relationships with our allies he’s all in on that. We need to find the financial incentive for him to do that and I think it’s been already identified repeatedly.  Will we actually invade Canada? No it is impossible to fight a land war with a country that is that huge and shares that much of a border with us. Will he try to destroy Canada economically so they are a shell of their former selves and the citizens are suffering so much they beg for the US? Sure he can try but he’s also destroying the US economy with it so I don’t think it will play out how he thinks it will play out.  And he is overestimating the appeal of America and egregiously underestimating the ability of people to withstand hardship to resist fascism.

If you are closely reading multiple news sources and watching the people in Congress talk on youtube, you are going to get a taste of his character via his actions.

"Fundamentally, if you're thinking about economic stuff, the truth is that Trump is being directed by oligarch to do the following: devalue the USD, rebalance domestic manufacturing, and create new, fairer trade agreements with our key trading partners using tariff reduction/removal as leverage.  Why devalue the USD: currently, foreign countries that don't their currency to the dollar have an ""unfair"" forex advantage when their currencies are weak.  This can be as high as 20-40% advantage for other countries when it comes to manufacturing and import/export.  When the USD is strong, it makes it very difficult for our domestic manufacturers to export profitably and our domestic service businesses to provide those services, software, etc, with decent margins.  When the USD is weak, purchasing from America is much cheaper for our trading partners & global markets, and the only real downside is 1) possible elimination of USD as global reserve currency (this isn't really a downside), and 2) things become ""more expensive"" for Americans traveling to or purchasing from foreign countries.  On social issues, I don't believe Trump has strong feelings about much at all so whoever his proxy is in whatever leadership position has pretty broad discretion to say or do what they want.",lilelliot,2025-03-13T10:42:04,1

"My conversation with an AI that validates many observations I have but did not volunteer to the AI:  Prompt: Here’s a situation I believe I see: a person (A) says something very offensive, for example an extremely unfair accusation or a threat. When another person (B) responds by expressing offense, yet another person (C) defends A by saying B misreads or overreacts or was “owned” (pranked in some supposedly funny game of getting an upset response) by A, and/or that A was blustering or joking or not serious. However, over time, A keeps repeating the same offensive remark. Moreover, in contexts where other people (D, E, F, large crowds..) don’t respond to the remark as offensive, A plays it off as a genuine or acceptable or serious remark, with none of A nor D, E, F etc. saying the remark is a joke or bluster or not serious. What could be happening here? In particular, what could be happening psychologically?  Response: This situation you describe involves complex social and psychological dynamics. Here are some possible explanations for what could be happening, particularly from a psychological perspective:  ### 1. **Gaslighting and Manipulation**    - Person A may be engaging in **gaslighting**, a form of psychological manipulation where someone makes another person doubt their perceptions or reactions. By framing their offensive remarks as jokes or bluster when challenged, A undermines B’s sense of reality. Over time, this can make B question whether their offense is justified, while A continues to repeat the behavior without accountability.    - Person C’s defense of A could be reinforcing this dynamic, either intentionally or unintentionally, by invalidating B’s feelings and normalizing A’s behavior.  ### 2. **Testing Boundaries and Social Norms**    - A might be **testing social boundaries** to see how far they can push their offensive remarks without facing consequences. When B reacts but others (D, E, F) do not, A learns that they can get away with the behavior in certain contexts. This is a form of **social conditioning**, where A adjusts their behavior based on the reactions they receive.    - In contexts where the remark is taken seriously, A may be seeking validation or asserting dominance, while in other contexts, they dismiss it as a joke to avoid accountability.  ### 3. **Cognitive Dissonance in the Group**    - The group (D, E, F, etc.) might experience **cognitive dissonance** when confronted with A’s behavior. They may downplay or ignore the offensive remark to maintain harmony or avoid conflict, especially if A holds social power or influence. Over time, this can lead to **normalization** of the behavior, where the group implicitly accepts it as acceptable.    - Person C’s defense of A could be a way to reduce their own discomfort, as acknowledging the offensiveness might require them to confront A or reevaluate their relationship with A.  ### 4. **A’s Personality Traits or Motivations**    - A might have **narcissistic or antisocial tendencies**, enjoying the power and attention they gain from provoking others. They may derive satisfaction from seeing B’s reaction and C’s defense, which reinforces their sense of control.    - Alternatively, A might be using humor or bluster as a defense mechanism to mask their own insecurities or aggressive intentions. By framing their remarks as jokes, they avoid taking responsibility for their actions.  ### 5. **Social Hierarchies and Power Dynamics**    - A’s behavior could be a way to assert dominance or maintain a **social hierarchy**. If A holds a position of power (e.g., in a workplace, social group, or online community), others might be reluctant to challenge them, even if they find the remarks offensive.    - Person C’s defense of A could be motivated by a desire to align themselves with A’s perceived power or to avoid becoming a target themselves.  ### 6. **Desensitization and Normalization**    - Over time, repeated exposure to A’s offensive remarks can lead to **desensitization**, where the group becomes less sensitive to the behavior. This can happen if the group prioritizes cohesion or avoids conflict, allowing A’s behavior to become normalized.    - Person C’s dismissal of B’s reaction might reflect this desensitization, as they no longer see the behavior as problematic.  ### 7. **B’s Psychological Impact**    - For Person B, this dynamic can lead to feelings of **isolation, self-doubt, or frustration**. If their reactions are consistently invalidated, they might start to question their own judgment or feel powerless to address the situation.    - This can also create a **hostile environment** for B, especially if they are the primary target of A’s remarks.  ### 8. **A’s Lack of Empathy or Awareness**    - A might lack **empathy** or awareness of how their remarks affect others. They may not fully understand the impact of their words or may prioritize their own amusement or agenda over the feelings of others.    - Alternatively, A might be aware of the impact but not care, especially if they perceive their behavior as socially acceptable within certain contexts.  ### What Can Be Done?    - **Set Boundaries**: B or others in the group can clearly communicate that A’s behavior is unacceptable, regardless of whether it is framed as a joke or bluster.    - **Seek Support**: B can seek allies within the group who recognize the behavior as problematic and are willing to address it collectively.    - **Confront the Behavior**: If safe to do so, B or others can directly confront A about the pattern of behavior and its impact.    - **Reevaluate Relationships**: If the behavior persists and the group continues to enable it, B might need to reconsider their involvement in the group or relationship with A.  In summary, this situation likely involves a combination of manipulation, power dynamics, and social conditioning. A’s behavior is enabled by the group’s reactions, and addressing it requires clear communication, boundary-setting, and collective accountability.",r_alex_hall,2025-03-14T13:17:27,1

">despite both Canada and Trump underscoring that Trump is serious.  Be careful, Canada doesn't **know** Trump is serious (since nothing has happened yet) - they're ""***taking him seriously***"" but that doesn't mean **he's serious**.  In all likelihood it is a negotiation tactic of sorts, but it's really fucking stupid, and you're right that he makes it hard to know when he's serious about something or not.  People won't like to hear it, but I think Trump is smarter than people believe. He's savvy when it comes to how he's interpreted, or how people might react to things he says. He knows how to intentionally stir the pot, he knows how to make headlines, he knows how to scare people, and it's not as accidental as many want to believe.  >So how are we supposed to decide if Trump is being serious or not?  You can't really. You can assume that anything that sounds too outrageous (like taking over Greenland or Canada) is most likely not serious in the sense that he's unlikely to actually invade these places and take them by force - he wouldn't have the institutional support for it anyway. For stuff like that you can assume he's doing it as some tactic, whether it's negotiation, diversion (taking attention away from somewhere else), or just to get people talking about Trump (all publicity is good publicity - he believes).

The assumption being that even if you don't get what you originally claimed to want, you'll still end up with more than if you'd gone in asking politely.  The downside of this approach is it pisses everyone off, gives you a reputation as erratic and antagonistic, potentially destabilizes the economy, and risks making dangerous mistakes through carelessness.

"This is pretty brilliant as a phrase to capture the shitegeist we're all living through.   That said, I'm more and more convinced the real explanation is simpler. Trump lies a lot, and half-lies etc. but much of the crap he says is better understood as fairy tales rather than lies. Tariffs are tax cuts, the 2020 election was stolen with millions of fraudulent votes, the US is experiencing an unprecedented crime wave based on... Haitians eating people's pets, I suppose?    These aren't lies intended to deceive anyone. Rather, what they are are fictions Trump and his followers pretend to believe. Fairy tales. The faithful recite the fairy tales while the rest of us go yo, what the fuck? They're a test of loyalty for a tribe of believers, not necessarily deceptions designed to hide the truth. It's all a big game of pretend, and if you're stuck in the reality-based community where facts still matter, then too bad for you because you don't understand how the game is played.  In more practical terms, these Trumpian fairy tales are also obviously pretexts. The election was stolen = a pretext to rig elections by restricting Democratic votes. Tariffs are tax cuts = an absurd smokescreen for the real goal which is destruction of the federal government to offset massive tax cuts and privatize revenue streams. Haitians are eating pets = a pretext for mass deportations. In that sense Trump's absurdities are deceptions, but they are more about misdirection and chaos than they are attempts to conceal or distort the truth.   It's just that the truth no longer matters. According to the inexorable math of social media, the person with the most attention wins. Having the most attention means controlling the narrative, and the truth just isn't sexy enough or spicy enough to rivet people's attention, particularly the low-information people who swing elections.",jetpacksforall,2025-03-13T14:11:32,14

"So, that was you destroying an argument? That's like saying Kamala had a plan for the economy, both are detached from reality. This laundry list of Kamala Harris “promises” is a pipe dream, conveniently ignoring that Democrats had two years with control of both houses of Congress (2021 to 2023) and delivered nothing. Tax cuts for the middle class? Capping prescription drugs? Billionaire taxes? Where were they when liberals held the reins? Nowhere, because they’re hollow campaign buzzwords, not results.   The complaint about Trump not doing things is laughable when he hasn’t even had a bill hit his desk yet in this term. Nothing’s been signed into law to impact the economy, zero, zilch, nada. Check the legislative calendar, Congress hasn’t passed anything for him to sign yet.  Energy prices? Down because of Trump’s executive orders boosting domestic production, not some socialist fairy tale. Grocery prices? We’re not a commie nation, governments don’t dictate prices down. That’s market forces, not Democrats waving a wand. The “price gouging ban” idea ignores Biden-Harris inflation spiking costs while they twiddled their thumbs. There was not and is not one example of greedy businesses gouging consumers. At least Trump’s EO on energy is already easing that burden, gas prices are trending down since he took office.  Now, these 'claims' (to put it nicely) about Trump’s “cuts” tanking 401ks, raising taxes, and unleashing chaos? Total fiction. Middle-class taxes haven’t spiked, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (still in effect) lowered them, and no new tax hikes have passed. Jobs lost? Unemployment’s dropping, BLS data proves it. Pollution? Gun violence? Rights? Liberals are just spewing hypotheticals with no evidence, because Trump’s barely two months in and hasn’t repealed anything they’re wailing about. Ukraine? Abortion? Billionaire tax cuts? No laws enacted yet; their predictions are baseless.  And that “Democrats can’t do anything now” excuse? Weak. They had power and blew it, don’t blame conservatives for liberal failures. Trump’s delivering results, energy independence, border security, while Democrats clutch pearls over imaginary disasters.

"> If your messaging is literal it doesn't need pontification or preaching. Just say the truth.  While I agree with much of what you say, my instincts point the other way about this. To me it seems that a common mistake Democrats make in their communications is to assume that just because something is true, then it must be persuasive. Or a related assumption: just because a policy is in someone's self-interest, that they will automatically tend to support that policy. Neither of those assumptions seems to work too well at the moment. Like I said before, the truth in itself is not sexy or spicy enough to grab people's attention, certainly not enough to take attention away from the jaw-dropping daily outrages coming from the reality TV show of Trump's administration.   My theory is that it's the math of social media at work here. Think about it. Trump makes an outrageous claim like Haitians are barbecuing people's dogs and cats in Springfield, OH. The claim is so insanely ridiculous that it goes viral and 400 million people hear about it within a few hours of him saying it. Meanwhile, the authorities in Springfield, including GOP officeholders, counter by saying that's a bunch of horseshit, and there's zero evidence any of this is happening here. Maybe 4 million people see or hear about the fact check from Springfield's mayor. See the problem? 400 million people are buzzing about Haitians eating pets, and only 4 million people are aware that it's been debunked by people who know what tf they're talking about. Given those numbers, what's the country focused on? Who's setting the agenda? Who's driving the terms of debate and making sure we're all talking about illegal immigration instead of any of the far more urgent problems facing the country and the world? It isn't the people telling the truth.   My conclusion is this: telling the truth is great, but if you can't make the truth entertaining and spicy enough to grab attention away from Trump's horseshit, then you might as well go home. Purely in terms of numbers, you're not even playing in the same league. You're not reaching the people you need to reach. You're not making a dent in his propaganda.

Wealthy investors who are salivating about cheaper access to Canadian resources and The white/Christian nationalists and Anti liberal types who love the Quebecois and Western Canadians rhetoric and don't want European immigration. They are pushing for the annexation, hoping that their cohorts in Canada, sick of Trudeau, immigration, and the decline in living standards would be open to the idea. Trumpworld is also looking at the fact that many Canadians spend months down in the Southern states during the winter or visit the US frequently on vacation. So many of our biggest stsrs in entertainment are Canadian by birth. Canadians leaders seem weak and ineffective, constantly looking for compromise. Politically and militarily, Canada always seem to align with our interests and support our causes. So, if they're already acting like US- lite, let's go ahead and add them to our country.

I want to clarify what you said about tariffs.  Basically, if I'm reading it right, you're saying ""If a company leader or many in the company voted for trump, then Trump slams said company with tariffs, that is, in a way, what they ""voted for"" even if they're not happy about it.""

I will say haven't looked into how much it has or hasn't backfired yet though. Basically I feel tariffs could ?maybe? be beneficial, as they could help make America less dependent on foreign countries (we are so in debt it's sad), but I would prefer if they weren't so large percentage-wise (thus harmful to small corporations) or if they targeted larger, more lucrative monopolies better, as those places are ROLLING in the money.   I am unsure on DOGE though.  I thought that DOGE was specifically targeting high government officials he was trying to cut the excessive funding/spending of, like politicians and/or. . .heck, the president and or Senate/house.
