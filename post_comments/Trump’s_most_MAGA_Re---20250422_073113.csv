">U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) is facing backlash over a tweet she posted after Pope Francis’s death on Monday.  >The Vatican announced that Francis died Monday morning after developing a bout of double pneumonia earlier this year. As many world leaders honored the late pope with condolences and heartfelt statements, Greene posted a cryptic statement declaring that “Evil is being defeated by the hand of God.”",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-22T07:31:31,164

"Without spoiling too much, your comment about ""god being real and incompetent"" fits well with Brandon Sanderson's cosmere series. Mistborn and the Stormlight archive are the two main series, but there are a ton of offshoot stories that run parallel. I recommend starting with Mistborn, but there are fan guides for reading order. It's a tall order and I highly recommend if you ever get to the Stormlight archive to read some of the smaller books in between haha.  Another book series I wish I could recommend, but it falls off hard after the first six books would be ""He who fights with Monsters."" The main protagonist starts off being an interesting character with a strong personality to reject power whether it comes from authority of rulers like kings, organizations, to even gods. As you can imagine, this gets him into all sorts of problems. The first three books are preem, it's a LitRPG which was a new concept to me at the time of reading, and I fell in love with the series. Book three has a fight sequence which was so hype I legit never have read anything close to that dopamine rush in thousands of books with fight scenes. I had to put the series down after book 10 because it just lost that spark the first three books started, 4-6 were interesting for narrative purposes and weren't bad, but everything after book 6 goes strongly downhill sadly. Edit: turns out some people said book 11 was actually better, might read it again, but damn 10 really sucked.  If you like JRPGs the ""Tales of"" series has always been pretty strong on the good looking religion of the bad guys. Tales of Symphonia and Tales of Berseria come to mind for this. Surprisingly FFX fits this bill as well, and overall the Japanese were always good with the religious antagonist plots.  There is probably more, just can't think of the titles off the top of my head.",oxero,2025-04-22T08:42:07,4

"Further recommendations from another Sanderson fan.  Iron Druid Chronicles (Kevin Hearne) - also see Ink and Sigil and Seven Kennings series  American Gods (Neal Gaiman)  Powder Mage series (Brian McClellen)  Inheritance Trilogy (NK Jemisin) - her other stuff is also good, but this series was my favorite.",Alternative-Hair1665,2025-04-22T13:25:48,3
"The first three books grow on you a lot. I remember not being a huge fan of the settings and such at first, but the story behind it the setting and all the other mysteries are really great hooks.",oxero,2025-04-22T11:28:29,1
