"Big disagree with this article, mostly because Gen X has never viewed itself as a bunch of whiners. Pick yourself up, rub some dirt on it, get a drink of water out of the hose and keep on trucking.   All the article’s negative data points are from Europe or San Francisco and center mainly around home ownership as the yardstick for happiness. Of course you can’t get anything decent someplace where the only way to own anything bigger than a shack is to already own it or inherit it.",docholiday999,2025-05-10T16:23:28,3
