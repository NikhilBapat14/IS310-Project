It's their patriotic duty to give their money to Dear Leader. He deserves it more than them.,mkt853,2025-05-08T13:48:27,3
Obviously.  Republican voters have been and will always be Trump's **marks.**  Name 1 Democrat that paid in for any of that trash fire nonsense. This is literally about the closest it can possibly get for Trump's target mark-audience (I.E the entire Republican party) to see that ***they*** are Trump's marks. I bet any money that they *still* won't see it and instead will claim those losses as (somehow) some big victory for the party.   I didn't buy into any of this. Did you? Trump's marks are his supporters.,TheNewTonyBennett,2025-05-08T13:59:03,3
They are having the life they voted for. Nothing to see here.,williamgman,2025-05-08T14:15:32,3
Small time Trump coin buyers are idiots. This is a system for big time oligarchs to buy time and influence with a corrupt president. If they thought otherwise they are fools and deserve to lose their life savings. If they think that is unfair they might try to consider voting differently in the future.,MadAstrid,2025-05-08T14:42:54,2
What a surprise.   Trump starts a scheme that makes him loads of money but which impoverishes anyone else who tries to buy into the scheme,crazybones,2025-05-08T15:48:31,2

Most of those meme coins or hype coins just tank after the initial pump. People think they’ll get rich quick and end up holding the bag. It’s always risky with that stuff.,BunnyBlossomz,2025-05-08T13:41:12,1
