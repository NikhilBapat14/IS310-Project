">The Alabama state House of Representatives passed several anti-LGBTQ+ bills this past Thursday. The bills include an expansion of the state’s “Don’t Say Gay” law, a ban on drag performances, a ban on Pride flags, and a ban on school employees calling trans students by the correct [pronouns](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/08/incomplete-list-gender-pronouns/).  >One of the bills would also require the Ten Commandments to be posted in every school in the state.  >The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gidley, also requires schools to display a statement near the Ten Commandments that says they are “a key part of the Judeo-Christian religious and moral tradition that shaped Western Civilization and ultimately the founding of the United States.”  >H.B. 244 extends the state’s ban on discussing LGBTQ+ people in schools, which currently only applies to grades K through 5, to all grade levels. It also bans school employees from “displaying flags or insignia relating to sexual orientation or gender identity,” which would include Pride flags. It also bans school employees from referring to a student with pronouns or a “title” that is “inconsistent with the student’s biological sex at birth.”  >[State Rep. Mark Gidley (R) said that the bill was necessary](https://alabamareflector.com/2025/04/18/alabama-house-passes-dont-say-gay-expansion-drag-performance-restrictions) because an unnamed student told him that they have a teacher who can’t teach without mentioning “all things gay and transgender.” Gidley didn’t say what school this happened in.  *But it's only K-3!! /s*     Christian nationalists are literally turning education into Sunday School. They're going to burn all the books that aren't Ben Hur, the Bible, and the Pilgrim's Progress, and they are going to also burn every queer person in sight, for ""transgressing"" their fascistic religion.      This is utterly gross and evil for Alabama to do. They wonder why no one wants to teach in Alabama, yet they keep doing this. They literally want queer kids to be bullied to death.",southpawFA,2025-04-23T12:52:27,7

"The very idea of ""Judeo-Christian"" anything is just Christian Nationalist propaganda. It's Christians trying to claim far more in common with Jews than there is. It's a Christian idea, not a Jewish idea. They couldn't even get the 10 sayings right. They call them commandments. For Jews they're instructions on how to live as a free people after their escape from Egypt. For Christians it's about submitting to authority, whether it's divine or secular.",cyberkine,2025-04-23T13:00:20,5

How about we teach the actually history of Western Civilization and its religious wars and conflicts that led to people being exiled/forced to flee here to avoid religious persecution.

"The full original translation of the 10th commandment contains the line ""Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Slaves"".  Exactly what Republican want to teach children.  And YES the bible explicitly condones slavery, but does condemn enslaving other Israelites or from your own nation.   They also want to ban books that mention anything that could be remotely related to being gay, but push to have a book in schools with numerous quotes like this one:  [https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/23-20.html](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ezekiel/23-20.html)",Captain_Aware4503,2025-04-23T13:06:01,2

I’m against this as a waste of time.  But teaching a generation of new Republican voters that it’s wrong to lie and murder could be a good thing.  Present leadership apparently never learned it.

Where do schools teach that it is okay to lie and murder? You do not need the bible to teach that. I would argue that it is better to NOT use the bible to teach this. The bible is pretty gruesome and justifies violence in many places (especially the Old Testament).  I vote yes for getting Sunday's off.

Worth remembering that the GOP outlawed teaching kids critical thinking skills in Texas a few years back along with introducing PragerU curriculum in Florida that literally teaches kids that slavery was a choice and that Native Americans *really* wanted to go live on reservations.
