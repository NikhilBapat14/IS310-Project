With McDonald's the only way to not get absolutely hosed on the price it to use their app. Who the hell plans out fast food in advance? This is supposed to be quick, easy junk food. It you're planning, you are planning something else! Service and speed has cratered. I'm not saying it was great before, but you could at least reliably count on getting what you ordered very quickly. Now you have to wait a bit while they take several minutes on your food. Like with the price, if you have to wait anyway you might as well get something better. This isn't just McDonald's it is all fast food.
