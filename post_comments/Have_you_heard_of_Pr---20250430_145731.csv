"The Heritage Foundation's [Project Esther](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/project-esther-national-strategy-combat-antisemitism) is only meant to address ""America’s virulently anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and anti-American 'pro-Palestinian movement' \[which they claim\] is part of a global Hamas Support Network."" They don't care about White Supremacist antisemetism at all.",AdventurousExpert217,2025-04-30T16:06:01,10
"From MassLive's story: ""Have you heard of Project Esther, Project 2025's lesser-known relative?   ""Last October, before Donald Trump was reelected president, [a little-known conservative plan](https://www.heritage.org/progressivism/report/project-esther-national-strategy-combat-antisemitism) positioning itself as a blueprint for combating antisemitism encouraged the next administration to [deport pro-Palestine protestors](https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/04/detained-grad-student-mahmoud-khalil-can-be-deported-immigration-judge-says.html) and [withhold public funds from institutions](https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/04/trumps-22b-funding-freeze-for-harvard-would-hit-cancer-research-battlefield-medicine-and-more.html) that support the cause.  If it sounds familiar, it’s because Trump appears to have followed its recommendations in his first 100 days back in the White House, especially in his [blitz against Harvard University](https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/04/how-trump-vs-harvard-is-a-page-out-of-the-project-2025-playbook.html) and higher education as a whole.
