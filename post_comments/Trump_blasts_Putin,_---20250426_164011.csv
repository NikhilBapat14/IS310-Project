Finally Trump figures out what the rest of the world already knows. Glad he figured it out finally but dang it's taking a while.,ergzay,2025-04-26T23:41:53,411

"Putin has no interest in peace, he wants all of western Europe.  And shortly after, he wants everywhere that *isn't* western Europe.",squunkyumas,2025-04-26T16:42:44,558
"I think Trump tried his hand at finding an end to the war that both sides could at least stomach. If Russia wishes to continue then I believe the US just needs to come out in full support of Ukraine providing them with all the military aid they need. I think that at least shows the world that if you’re not willing to work with us, like Ukraine has, then you are against us.",-deteled-,2025-04-26T19:49:46,224
Trump cannot be that naive.,AdagioVast,2025-04-27T09:18:22,41
"Here's one for the downvotes.  Russia didn't invade Ukraine for slave labor.  Russia didn't invade Ukraine for minerals.  Russia didn't even invade Ukraine to liberate people with Russian heritage.  Russia invaded Ukraine with the ultimate goal of creating a buffer state between Russia and the west.  Russia invaded Ukraine because Russia thinks the west is a threat and it wanted a buffer state to guarantee its own security.  I think originally they would've settled for a guarantee of Ukrainian neutrality.  But given Zelensky's (understandable) persistence, in conjunction with what I think was (to Russia at least) unexpected western support, Russia has now come to the conclusion that Ukraine will never be neutral so long as any pro-western regime remains in charge.  So now Russia is opting to continue the war until it ensures that Ukraine is not aligned with the west, one way or another.  Doesn't matter how much the west protests that its innocent, Russia thinks otherwise, and unless you're willing to escalate things to the point where what Russia thinks becomes irrelevant, peace talks can only occur within that framework.  You won't get Russia to voluntarily come to the peace table until Russia thinks its security is guaranteed.  But nobody in the west is prepared to talk about that, so the war will continue either until the day Russia thinks its security is guaranteed (either by its own efforts, or by western promises), or the west escalates and involuntarily forces Russia to the peace table.  For my own 2c... I don't think escalation is good for anybody.  Not the west.  Not Russia.  And certainly not for Ukraine, who will certainly be caught in the middle and suffer even more than it already has.",Shadeylark,2025-04-27T07:30:14,21
"I don’t think Trump ever Trusted Putin, he thought he could control him with diplomacy and stoking his raging ego. I don’t think he was wrong for trying to build Putin’s trust. There is still time to get things turned around. I can understand Ukrainian position if they give Russia an inch, they will take a yard. There was never going to be an easy answer here. Ukraine at least has something to offer to pay for our military weapons. This really does lie on the shoulders of Europe though. They need to keep up the pressure on Russia.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-04-26T18:18:33,-37
"Then let's step away. Not our problem anymore. China should be our focus, let Europe deal with this conflict. No more US money going towards this!",krazyellinas23,2025-04-26T19:40:17,-113
Ukraine blows up Russian's bridge while the talks are going on. They celebrate the destruction and mock Russia. Russia responds by shelling Kiev. Media only reports the latter.     I am so sick and tired of this propaganda.,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-26T17:53:01,-305

"He may, or he may not.  But it's what he wants.  He was trained to be loyal to a Russia-centric Soviet empire. He didn't invade Crimea because he has a legitimate claim, or because of Nazis in the Ukrainian military, or any of that other garbage.  The man wants to expand. Aggressively, if necessary.",squunkyumas,2025-04-26T17:25:29,227

"You never had me but you lost me legitimate claim to  Crimea    Their Black Sea Fleet home port is Crimea.   The reason we are in this mess is thinking Putin isn't a rational actor and not caring about our actions. Even if Putin takes the whole of Ukraine today. All of Ukraine neighbors are in NATO. What world do we think that Russia can struggle for years fighting a backed ""ally"" but just steam roll fighting Article five post Ukraine invasion.   Absolute nonsense.",red-african-swallow,2025-04-26T18:16:28,-109

"I think it's pretty damn clear that they were ever interested in peace. The whole ""Russia wants peace"" angle is purely an American creation (with maybe the assistance of a bit of Russian propaganda).",ergzay,2025-04-26T23:43:18,79

What's the difference between giving them the planes and training their pilots (like we've been doing) and flying our own planes with our own pilots? We'd be cutting out the corrupt middleman,AtomicPhantomBlack,2025-04-27T07:55:17,46
Some of them may be bots or part of a paid network but a lot of people get in their heads that the propaganda is reality and that they have to spread the news like a missionary to nonbelievers.,kaytin911,2025-04-27T14:27:47,4
">Their Black Sea Fleet home port is Crimea.   If the US wanted to annex parts of England, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, South Korea, Greece, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and dozens of other countries, would we have a legitimate claim? We have active military bases in all of those countries.",mexils,2025-04-27T02:08:27,73
"""I park my boats here"" is not a legitimate claim.  Also, saying Putin *wants western Europe* (which is what I said) is vastly different from saying  *he is capable of taking it* (which is what you are responding to, wrongly).  He wants all of it. He is not capable of taking it, but that changes very little about the previous point.",squunkyumas,2025-04-27T12:41:59,14
"You're being downvoted by the liberal bots lol.   Amazing how contradictory their thinking is. On one hand, Russia is a corrupt gas station with nukes, on the other hand, russia is gonna take over the whole of Western Europe.   If the latter was really the case may as well forget about backing Ukraine, they've got zero chance, even with American weapons, against a hyper power that can conquer the whole western Europe. Even Hitler didn't manage that.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-27T02:08:36,-34

"Let's be honest here; what is the functional difference between ""incorporating it into America"" and installing a regime that will do whatever America tells it to do?

I'll use Okinawa as an example. If the people of Okinawa started Primary uses English and identify as Japanese Americans. Then the Japanese government in illregar tries to pushed the Americans out.   Then yes we might have a claim. I would say we have a weaker claim then Russia over Crimea. But in 20 years Americans would be in Okinawa for 100 years add additional 50 or 60 years and a cultural shift. Then yes.   The question is if self-determination matters more then then the technical government authority. For the most part I said with the governmental authority.,red-african-swallow,2025-04-27T14:38:18,-1
"Parking your boats and propping up the region with miltary resources, cultural, and personally for 150+ years. Might be a legitimate claim. I mean it's more tangible then China claim to the South Asian Sea cause our old maps say so.   The rest of western Europe is already in NATO (execpt Moldova) so if he invades Western Europe he might as well do the rest since it would trigger Article 5.",red-african-swallow,2025-04-27T14:50:01,1

"> And Ukraine went from being the most corrupt nation in 2013, to being an ideal for democracies in 2014. Give me a break. Guys running Ukraine are Nazis. You just don’t get told about it.

And how does them being corrupt or not defend Russia invading it? Like that's not even a defense.",ergzay,2025-04-26T23:44:54,29
">He wants all of it. He is not capable of taking it, but that changes very little about the previous point.  Lol yet another contradictory statement. Since you just admitted *he can't actually achieve his goals*, what's the point of worrying about him?",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-28T03:33:14,1
"It doesn’t. Why do you defend fascists?   I am specifically referring to lack of information in the media. By only showing one side, we get ignorant people like you who are ready to support terrorists, Nazis and other scum. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-26T18:39:14,-27
These are not contradictory even in the least.  It is worthwhile to understand the motivations of an expansionist megalomaniac.,squunkyumas,2025-04-28T05:18:41,2
"You keep bringing up corruption and these so called nazis like that justifies an invasion. It doesn’t.  By your logic, any country that's not perfect deserves to be attacked and occupied? That’s just ridiculous.  And let’s be honest. Russia isn’t some innocent victim. It’s an authoritarian state that jails journalists, poisons opposition leaders, and censors anything it doesn’t like.  If you’re so worried about corruption, censorship and fascism, you should be looking at Moscow, not Kyiv.  You’re just making excuses for imperialism.",Dutchtdk,2025-04-26T18:53:38,157

"Logic doesn't make sense. You are supposed to only look at one evil, just because the other one is being attacked? So when Russia attacked Afganistan, and we supported Afganistan, what has happened when Russians withdrawn? Exactly, terrorists took over. So you want 21st century Nazis to start from Ukraine?
