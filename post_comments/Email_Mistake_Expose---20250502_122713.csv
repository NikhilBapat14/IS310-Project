"Both my kids have been through the headstart program.  It's amazing and really sets them up for success in elementary school. They have no hearts cutting a program like that, it does so much good for kids and really should be available to everyone. I was ""lucky"" in that I was laid off when enrollment opened and I qualified. Things are much better these days, but I will never not be appreciative or supportive to head start and the teachers who run it and similar programs.",chu_chu_rocket,2025-05-02T12:45:34,87
">The Department of Health and Human Services plans to end research into how to improve child welfare programs like Head Start, according to an email mistakenly sent by an HHS employee to grant recipients.   >The email contained a spreadsheet listing 150 research projects on HHS’s chopping block, including grants funded by the Office of Planning, Research, and Evaluation. The office’s mission is to build “evidence to improve lives” by helping to examine programs helping low-income children and families. ",thenewrepublic,2025-05-02T12:27:26,22

"This really hurts kids in neglectful or abusive households and working parents. Kids in neglectful or abusive households benefit from the interventions provided by Headstart. This increases a child's chances of success in school and decreases their chance of developing executive dysfunction and other developmental issues that result in mental illnesses later on down the road. For working parents headstart gives them the ability to work without paying for preschool or a sitter. The program goes beyond what is provided to children in preschool and daycare settings.   But rich people, their children will still excel. So they can be your child's boss at the sweatshop they work in. Isn't this great!? Aren't we all happy!?",ariesgeminipisces,2025-05-02T21:13:59,4

"They attack education because they don’t want a population that thinks for themselves. Hopefully everyone reading this understands how this is a threat, not only to civilization but also themselves. An uneducated populace is dangerous.",pethanct01,2025-05-02T12:49:05,56

No they attack these government services because they want people going to and using essentially scam services with no oversight. RFK campaigned on his “wellness farms” so it’s basically just going to be the troubled teen industry all the way down.  Will there be any oversight? Nope. Standards of care? Nope. Investigations into abuses/deaths? Nope. Studies on efficacy? Nope.,Ja3k_Frost,2025-05-02T13:27:14,15
"It’s honestly just money. Paying money to help poor people, scamming for money for useless private services that cost too much, making money using tax dollars to fund private schools to shutter the public school competition.   It’s not some deep conspiracy to alter us mentally and culturally. It’s just the same old casual cruelties and exploitation of wanting more money.   Which is not complicated. Just . . .
