"Translation: Be sure to funnel your countries bribes appropriately, by buying $Trump meme coins, to ensure your tariffs are closer to 10% and don't end up being 'much higher'.",zambabamba,2025-05-08T10:49:00,27

So any trade deal at best still has a 10% tariff on imports?  Translation is higher cost for goods for us.  All this assumes he doesn’t change his mind and scrap whatever deal is made. Volatility is why Trump backed off. If he’s not happy he’ll go back to policies that create volatility and we’re back in the shit.,hmr0987,2025-05-08T10:57:53,8

"This is all he has. This deranged, mangled tariff blitz. And make no mistake, when he says our country is in for a world of hurt and we need our “medicine” and to stop buying dolls for your kids, he means he will ensure this future.

Any trade deal made with this admin isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on. He ripped up the trade deals his admin made during his first term. His signature means nothing. ,Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-08T11:02:51,3

It's so crazy how much he's devalued the words of the president. Dude lies so much that the world just kind of ignores most of what he says because it means nothing. He would really benefit from learning the lessons of the boy who called wolf.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-08T11:00:30,7
