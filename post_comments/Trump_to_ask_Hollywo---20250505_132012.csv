"My guess is his buddy Kevin Sorbo called him. Just look at his own shows, past and coming -  * **Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995–1999)** This series, along with its preceding TV movies, was filmed entirely in **New Zealand**. The country's diverse landscapes provided the backdrop for the show's mythological setting. * **Kull the Conqueror (1997)** This fantasy film was shot in **Slovakia and Croatia**, utilizing Eastern Europe's historic architecture and landscapes to depict its ancient world. * **Andromeda (2000–2005)** The science fiction series was filmed in **Canada**, a common location for sci-fi productions due to its versatile settings and production facilities. * **Left Behind: Rise of the Antichrist (2023)** This film was shot in **Calgary, Alberta, Canada**, taking advantage of the city's urban and natural environments. * **The American Miracle: Our Nation Is No Accident (2025)** This upcoming film includes scenes filmed in the **United Kingdom**, reflecting its historical themes.",Melodic-Frosting-443,2025-05-05T13:23:50,3

"Well they definitely aren't going to be interested in reciprocal tariffs that cut them out of 95% of the world's audience.    I would guess most Americans don't watch foreign movies as is, so there's absolutely no upside.  That's why we keep getting American remakes of 2 year old European hits.",Nevarian,2025-05-05T14:43:32,1
It doesn’t matter because apparently the statue he uses for his tariff authority specifically bans films from tariffs.,ennuiinmotion,2025-05-05T16:46:52,1

Rise of the Antichrist wasn't a Trump documentary.   However Sorbo did film a little-known arthouse movie which is two and a half hours of just a close-up of Trump's face as he shits into his diaper.,StoppableHulk,2025-05-05T13:36:30,6
"""But on Monday, White House spokesman Kush Desai said that “no final decision on foreign film tariffs have been made.”  Desai also said, “The Administration is exploring all options to deliver on President Trump’s directive to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.”   LMFAO. I wish they'd stop trying to make things great. Like please we don't need any more greatness..Just freaking stop already.",Potential-Lack-5185,2025-05-05T13:52:08,4
