"We say it’s just for murderers now, but where does the line stop? Rapists? Thieves? People of a certain race or status? History has shown us what happens when a government starts deciding who is “worthy” of life. Are we really okay walking down the same path that led to the camps in Nazi Germany? This isn't justice, it's the start of something far darker.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T10:21:44,11
Let's not post sources that calls its own viewers cousin fucking terrorists and had to pay almost one billion dollars for lying.  No one thinks fox news viewers are dumber than fox news does.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T10:37:22,9
So... who is getting deported? I'm confused because only rapists and murderers were getting deported according to the admin.,InsideAardvark1114,2025-05-09T10:24:34,7
And since they've decided due process is unnecessary...,MrLurid,2025-05-09T10:22:09,3
Due process?,WmnChief,2025-05-09T10:28:41,3
I fail to see how being in the country illegally is an aggravating factor warranting a harsher sentence. At the most it should be a separate crime carrying its own sentence.,DartTheDragoon,2025-05-09T10:30:46,3
"So is the administration deciding who's a murderer like they're deciding who's a gang member, or...?",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-09T10:53:53,3

Tim McVeigh went through due process,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-09T10:39:31,-4
"I agree.   BEING in the US ""illegally"" isn't even a crime, it's a civil offense. ENTERING illegally is a misdemeanor with like a 6 month max sentence for the first offense.   The government is really raiding homes solely over civil offenses and misdemeanors.",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-09T11:02:26,3
"I think this is a means to grab more publicity for instances in which this happens so that they can pretend that it is more frequent than it actually is.  So, just a form of fearmongering.",WhatRUHourly,2025-05-09T10:43:24,1
"Probably. It seems like the GOP is setting things up so they can round up any political dissidents, claim they are criminals, and then immediately execute them without due process.",TranquilSeaOtter,2025-05-09T11:24:07,1
"It’s not just about whether the death penalty exists, it’s about how it's applied. If we start fast-tracking execution based on political pressure or targeting certain groups disproportionately, then due process isn’t just eroded, it’s weaponized. Justice has to be impartial and deliberate, or it stops being justice at all.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T10:41:59,5
Yes.,DartTheDragoon,2025-05-09T10:45:21,10

What about Tim McVeigh?   He got due process and it worked.,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-09T10:44:54,-3
Tim McVeigh getting executed was a mistake?   What about Nazis getting executed? ,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-09T10:51:50,-3
