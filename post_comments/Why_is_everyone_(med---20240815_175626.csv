"What you really mean is that, if a candidate is going to be addressed using _only_ one name that name is commonly their last name.  So while the NYT might refer to ""Donald Trump"" ([and frequently does](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=%22donald+trump%22+site%3Anytimes.com)) when shortening that it is always to ""Trump"" and never ""Donald.""    Both Harris and Clinton have encouraged the use of their first names in their own campaigns.  There's plenty of reasons why a candidate might want to do that but the most common is that it makes them feel more approachable.    As gendered as it might seem, it's not entirely thus.  ""Mayor Pete"" obviously branded himself around his first name as did ""Jeb!"" Bush.  Likewise Senator (Elizabeth) Warren prefers a last-name-primary mode of address as did Feinstein, Duckworth, Blackburn, Murkowski, Collins, etc.",Killfile,2024-08-15T19:52:17,192
Kamala is much more unique and distinctive than Harris,kosmonautinVT,2024-08-15T20:02:58,60
Kamala is memorable and kinda rolls off the tongue. Harris is just sorta there.,bappypawedotter,2024-08-15T20:02:45,43
It largely depends on preference. She has stated she likes Kamala. It seems to be a mix. Bernie definitely is more recognizable than Sanders.,JustRgJane,2024-08-15T20:34:29,34
"It's almost never going to be one thing.   There's a general wave of candidates turning more towards branding themselves as first name forward - especially now when the feeling is that the public wants someone to break through as 'real' rather than a generic politician, they want something personable. And that makes candidates going by first name seem more approachable and down to earth. You often hear the old adage of people wanting 'someone they could grab a beer with' - and that feels closer as a first name person than a last name person. Bernie. Mayor Pete. etc.   And that's actually a reverse of what the usual wisdom would be, that first names are often too common. A candidate just going by Mike is going to be hard to claim as their brand. Mike! Mike who? Mike Johnson? Mike Pence? Mike Bennett?   And there's certainly a gendered aspect to it, and in this case, a racial/ethnic one. There is a marked trend in women candidates being more commonly referred to by first name. Some of that is certainly a bias - some of that is, to the point above, there have been fewer women and frankly even fewer women from backgrounds with non-anglosphere  names. That makes it easier to brand off of. And also, the push really came in response with Harris to people mocking her for her name. She ran ad campaigns off of people intentional or not messing up her name.   But also for some, like Harris, she herself actually prefers to be referenced as Kamala",PhiloPhocion,2024-08-15T20:54:40,14
"Don’t know why exactly.   I called George W Bush “Dubya” I call Barack Obama “Obama” I call Donald Trump “Trump” I call Joe Biden “Joe”, sometimes “Biden” I call Kamala Harris “Kamala”   I often called Bill Clinton “Bill” I always called Hillary Clinton “Hillary” I always call Bernie Sanders “Bernie”  Most other candidates and presidents I just use their last name.

It depends on the candidate I think and how they want to brand themselves.  Hillary Clinton used Hillary too I think.  Maybe you could argue it's a male vs female thing.,ThisIsOnlyANightmare,2024-08-16T00:21:31,2

"With men it can be a pro propaganda,  Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson became known simply as Boris which helped him win the mayoralty in London and later become Prime Minister.

"Lots of candidates use their first name. If you look at the [2016 Republican primary participants' logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries), you have some using just last name (Trump, Kasich, Gilmore, Cristie), some using just first name (Jeb, Rand, Carly) and some using first and last (Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee). On the Democrat side, Clinton's logo is an H (for her first name) and Sanders' logo is ""Bernie"". It was common to hear things like ""Bernie supporters"".  Campaigns make a choice at how they want to be represented and media tends to at least partly defer to that. Sometimes the reason is because the first name is more specific. For example, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton all used their first name a fair amount because Ron Paul, George Bush and Bill Clinton are prominent existing politicians. Or, for example, because Jeb Bush might have been not looking to play up that he's part of a dynasty. It's also the reverse, Christie didn't go by Chris because there are a lot of people named Chris out there. Kasich didn't go by John because there are a lot of Johns out there. Other times, it's for branding reasons. My guess is that Jeb and Bernie were trying to create a more personable brand, so they went with first names. Meanwhile, somebody like Trump was running on the family business legacy so he might prefer his last name.  Kamala Harris may find that Kamala is more memorable and unique, sounds friendlier and reminds people of her ""diverse"" background in a race against a white dude (Biden then Trump). Not to mention that there is presently a [congressman Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Harris_(politician)).",CreativeGPX,2024-08-16T12:59:36,1

And no this was never a ""just call me Elaine"" thing. It is an attempt diminish her authority.

"It's become a lot more common lately. Buttigieg, Clinton, Sanders, Bush (you know which one) and more have all focused on their first name over their last. Part of it is probably a branding preference--Kamala is much less generic than Harris, and Hillary, Bernie, and Jeb probably all felt similarly. Part of it is that these are all candidates that had to focus on relatability, and calling people by their last name so only relatable if you're a bro in a high school locker room.",mormagils,2024-08-17T20:50:37,1
