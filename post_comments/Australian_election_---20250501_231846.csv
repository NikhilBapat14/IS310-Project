"For the second time in a week, Trump is looming over an election in another country. Australians go to the polls on Saturday.  The Australian Labor Party (ALP) had been struggling. But in the past few months the ALP has nudged ahead of the three-party grouping consisting of the Liberal Party of Australia, the Liberal National Party of Queensland, and the National Party of Australia. This grouping in political discourse is usually referred to as The Coalition. And the two parties with ""liberal"" in their names are more like the pre-Brexit UK Conservative Party. Just remember that **Liberal â‰  liberal** down under.   Trump's interference in Australia is nowhere near as intrusive as it is in Canada, but he's regarded as a political polecat by Australians who prize stability. Because the Coalition has occasionally been identified with some positions reminiscent of MAGA, that has been enough to cause support to drop for it.   So if the ALP wins on Saturday, that will show that Canada was no fluke.",clamorous_owle,2025-05-01T23:38:33,9
