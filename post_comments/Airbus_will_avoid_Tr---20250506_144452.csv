"From a very quick google search doesn't look like it, only restrictions that come up are needing specific safety certs which isn't hard for US based airlines to abide by, and the only other restriction I could find was foreign airlines not being able to make domestic flights for goods or people, but if it is a US based airline that wont apply since it did not mentions planes specifically. If I am wrong though and someone has better info please correct me.",BJYeti,2025-05-07T00:58:00,2

It seems far more likely he's given examples to use to justify a decision he was already determined to make.,Describing_Donkeys,2025-05-06T17:34:43,6
