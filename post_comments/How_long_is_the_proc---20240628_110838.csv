"[Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed in 30 days.](https://cnn.com/2020/09/19/politics/supreme-court-justice-confirmations-timeline)  All the other sitting justices took between 66 days (Gorsuch) and 106 days (Thomas). Roberts took a total of 72 days, but only 23 after his name was submitted for chief justice.  [The shortest ever confirmation process was zero days, twice](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/02/07/up-until-the-postwar-era-u-s-supreme-court-confirmations-usually-were-routine-business/). Edward Douglass White was confirmed for associate justice by voice vote the same day his nomination was submitted, and then again for chief justice by voice vote on the same day his nomination was submitted.   Brandeis was the longest successful confirmation process at 125 days.  CNN and Pew are counting days differently, CNN from when the president announced the nomination and Pew from when it was officially submitted.",NYSenseOfHumor,2024-06-28T12:47:05,3
> Edward Douglass White  It would be more helpful to at least [cite the wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edward_Douglass_White#United_States_Supreme_Court) for him rather than an article that just mentions him.,AuditorTux,2024-06-28T13:49:27,0
