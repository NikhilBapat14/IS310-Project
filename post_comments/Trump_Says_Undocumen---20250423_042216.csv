"1. These are not jury trials.    2. No one has claimed that barring entry is not due process or that you have to have due process to be turned away at the border.  Many people are even okay, but to a lesser degree, with laws that allow for the expedited removal of immigrants found within 100 miles of the US border who have only been in the US a limited amount of time.  Unfortunately, the US government under several presidents have chipped away at these rights with most recently Trump expanding this to include anyone who has illegally entered regardless of location who has been here less than 2 years.  That expansion I consider to be an overreach and a violation of the US Constitution.  3. What happens in England or France is not relevant because we're discussing US laws and what rights are afforded to people within the jurisdiction of the US.    4. Despite it not being relevant, many countries take in asylum seekers and allow those asylum seekers to live in the country pending an asylum hearing to determine whether or not their asylum claim is valid enough to allow them to stay.  Both the UK and France do this.  In fact, France is one of the main asylum countries in the EU.  5.

To answer your question directly, no I wouldn’t expect that England or France would let me walk in without an ID or passport.

"According to the ACLU situation that you are referring to they state: “Fairness and individualized due process must be restored to the system. Expedited removal should be limited to cases where individuals are apprehended at ports of entry or land borders. All individuals must be screened to determine whether they are eligible for immigration relief or prosecutorial discretion, especially if they have US-based families or have lived in the U.S. for a substantial period of time. Individuals without a lawyer should be advised of their rights by a judge before agreeing to stipulated removal and there should be an appeal process. Anything less is un-American.”  So you agree with the ACLU when it was criticizing Obama but not when they state the literal exact same thing many Reddit users are telling you now. You ignore that part. Many people would hold Obama to the same standards as they are holding Trump, not everyone is part of the cult like you.

">he was handed a deportation order. Three weeks later police arrested him at his home.  =  >21 days written notice of deportation with the option to appeal  You've just described exactly the type of due process that I, and the court system, are suggesting is required. I'm not saying that you aren't allowed to deport people who are in the country illegally. I'm not saying you can't change your policy on who gets deported or why. I'm saying that you have to tell someone they're being deported, why they're being deported, and give them some opportunity to make their case. What the current administration is doing is literally picking people up off the street and flying them to a prison in El Salvador with no option for recourse. The point is that governments make mistakes, and people (yes, all people) have to have the opportunity to correct those mistakes *before* they are deprived of life or liberty. It's *literally* in both the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. We have a country that is fundamentally built on, among other things, the principle that we can't trust individual government actors to act unilaterally to take away people's rights.  The Trump administration is trying to reframe the conversation as ""we don't have the resources or obligation to give everyone slated for deportation a years long criminal trial."" No one is asking them to. They are being told by the courts that they have to give people due process (i.e. written notice and a chance to pre-emptively correct administrative errors) before depriving them of liberty, and then they are being told what that due process could look like based on established examples.  Fundamentally, the point is that by depriving people of any due process, there's no mechanism to correct the government's mistakes. And under the current administration, the stakes of those mistakes aren't being sent back to your home country where you could theoretically work with US or local officials to correct that mistake post hoc or choose to re-integrate into your native society. The consequence of the government's mistakes as it stands today is life in prison without criminal charge or conviction in a country that may or not be your home. If you think that people shouldn't be given so much as written notice and a couple weeks to prove that the allegations against them are untrue or to leave the country under their own power before being sent to prison for life in a country that has proven that they're unwilling to collaborate with our government to correct any mistakes, I think Thomas Jefferson and James Madison would have a hell of a lot to say to you. Fortunately, they wrote down their thoughts a couple hundred years ago, and it only takes like a half hour to read both key documents.  ETA: I had just scanned your link before originally commenting. Now that I've read it in full, I want to point out how deeply it contradicts the Trump admin's position. France has recently significantly expanded the scope of who they are targeting for deportation. They have increased deportations by roughly a quarter in the last calendar year. The people who have been deported have been sent primarily to their home countries. In those home countries, they are living freely with the ability to challenge the findings of the French immigration courts, call their loved ones, visit consulates, apply for Visas, etc. Regardless of whether you agree with the goal of cracking down on immigration, this pattern in France is proof positive that you can dramatically ramp up deportations while still following procedures that allow people to do things like stay with family and get jobs in their home country as they try to sort out their status. The Trump admin is completely depriving hundreds of people of these options by sending them to a black site in a third country under cover of night. I may disagree with the current French government's goals (doesn't really matter since I'm not French), but the actions described in this article would not make me concerned that they are sending innocent people, including legal residents, to prison for life with no charges or option for recourse.  Edit 2: Also, I just realized that you cut out the part where I said ""in case they were deporting me by mistake"" before you said the thing about the ""mechanism"" being to not live there illegally for decades. A major part of the point of due process in these cases is that it's possible to be put on a list for deportation erroneously. If that had happened under the current paradigm that deprives individuals of the due process necessary to prove the government's mistake, what would have stopped those people from ending up in CECOT?
