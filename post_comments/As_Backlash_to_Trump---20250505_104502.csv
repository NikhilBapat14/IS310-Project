They have an app that folks use in France to check if the product is made in the US. You simply scan the code and it identifies it.  https://www.youtube.com/live/Zy_qQOy0gOM?si=wYOOE-r_8_sus5nu,williamgman,2025-05-05T11:08:16,24

Trump is a rapist.  He probably just expected the rest of the world to take it.,clueless_in_ny_or_nj,2025-05-05T11:19:20,4
The main impact will be discretionary visits to the USA and Tesla simply because it's very straightforward to find perfectly good alternatives to both.   Services are trickier as the big names have made their various streaming platforms very good and are very established. There's never going to be a genuine European YouTube competitor ditto Netflix. That said it's perfectly possible to have local versions of both (and similar) registered and taxed in a particular territory for example. Ford of Europe isn't being boycotted and won't be subject to any tariffs by the EU being a GmbH in Cologne.,qwerty_1965,2025-05-05T11:12:08,7

I don’t assume he has a plan. I think he’s a fool. But that doesn’t mean he can’t accidentally make things better in some small ways. I’m crossing my fingers for that.,indierockrocks,2025-05-05T13:28:49,2
