"> “Nothing happened for a long, long time, you know, for at least over an hour. And then, you know, after that, they finally told us to leave, and I told him I was leaving, they came outside the gate and arrested me,” Baraka said during his appearance on MSNBC’s “The Briefing” Friday night. “So it looked like it was targeted.” >  > He later added that ICE officials “obviously targeted me.”  >  > “I wasn’t the only one out there. They came directly to me and tried to arrest me … no one else. Me,” the mayor told host and former White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “And so, I honestly believe, you know, I was targeted there.”  Certainly wouldn't surprise me that ICE would target a recognizable local politician, and it is a terrifying omen given the lawless approach of this administration. Hopefully this is a watershed moment that starts to make more Americans stand up against the wannabe dictator in the white house's regime",UWCG,2025-05-10T11:37:53,1
Now they're arresting their political opponents...It's starting to look an awful lot like the 1930's around here.,pragmatichokie,2025-05-10T11:56:59,1
"You should see the ""theories"" over on the conservative subreddit. They're not at all upset that a mayor was arrested for no reason but rather ""Well now he's gonna be made into a Martyr.""  Some are even admitting it doesn't look like he committed a crime and they just arrested him to throw around their own power, and their main concern is still that he would be a martyr and ICE are the bad guys, in turn making the Trump administration look bad.",Virtual-Pie5732,2025-05-10T12:03:11,1
Go straight back and make them arrest you again. Don’t stop the fight.,StartButtonPress,2025-05-10T16:00:04,1

"The general populace of Americans aren’t going to do anything until it this administration affects them personally in a big way. I tell my friends and family when the protests are, I tell them to boycott companies, I update them on the EOs. They don’t show up, they don’t slow consumption, they don’t read the EOs.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-10T12:42:58,1
Every single human on that verbal pool of hate is a willing contender for every horrible plan that negatively affects other humans solely for monetary “gain”,Nervous_Tax3843,2025-05-10T12:45:51,1
Same. Locally people just tell me they refuse to engage with the news at all.,leechmilyfe4,2025-05-10T13:29:13,1
I hate when people are embarrassed to talk about current events so they say something about they aren’t involved in politics. Bitch it’s your civic duty to be educated and engaged.,Internal-Quantity743,2025-05-10T16:54:14,1
