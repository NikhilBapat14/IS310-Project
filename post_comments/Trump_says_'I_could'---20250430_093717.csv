Is to get rid of MAGA, the GOP, and the republican party they only wake America go backwards— we could be the best country if only we continued to move forward under a party that valued— this day and age— where equality- and the lives of every day Americans mattered.",mlineras,2025-04-30T11:43:10,3
Okay. Contempt. Charge everyone involved in obstructing a court order with contempt. Isn’t this how it should work normally?,Flat-Emergency4891,2025-04-30T16:55:06,4

So impeach the bastard,Karl-ge,2025-04-30T19:48:12,1
He should have been impeached on day one of his first term for his emoluments clause violations.   There is nothing that says we have to wait until he does something new to impeach him for high crimes and misdemeanors. You don't have to only impeach for something he did during the current term.  There isn’t a statute of limitations on any of this. Even double jeopardy doesn’t apply.,specqq,2025-04-30T11:28:09,15
"You need republicans, and specifically the speaker, to want to impeach. Or wait for 2026.",chmod777,2025-04-30T12:22:14,3
"So the government works where the Democrats have to be in the majority in Congress to Impeach a republican president. The republicans are in the majority in Congress.  This is why we have to turn states blue locally to get a Democratic majority. To overturn Congress, so we can impeach.  Democrats have absolutely no power. Unless thr Republicans impeach him, which likely won’t happen",whatishappening2022,2025-04-30T16:00:15,1

"I think everyone is waiting for him to make a bad decision, bigger than anything he has currently done, that has the majority of the country going crazy. It will take that for Republicans to participate.",Lebarican22,2025-04-30T19:50:46,2

"I wonder if Senators fail to do their job, is there anything legally we can do to remove them from position. ",Lebarican22,2025-04-30T13:14:46,1
We can dream. I think the kkkult is absolutely brain washed and with him to the end no matter what.,Karl-ge,2025-04-30T19:51:56,1
"Impeachment starts in the house.   Some states have recall processes. But you need to live in the state/district.  The congress can eject members as well, but again requires the gop to not be shitty.  So best case is 4 gop senators decide to spend time with their families, or 5 gop reps do. And are replaced by dems.",chmod777,2025-04-30T13:23:12,1
