"Honestly I don't think this is that bad really. I say this because there are a few truths about Hydrogen that people don't realise.  While it is true that the combustion of Hydrogen is clean, the production of Hydrogen is far from it. The bulk of Hydrogen production comes from natural gas, this process involves reactions with water at high temperature and pressure, in most cases the heat comes from the burning of natural gas so there is a carbon footprint for that, but it doesn't stop there, the reaction itself also produces CO2 and not a small amount of it. Approximately 44 tonnes of CO2 is produced for every 6 tonnes of H2 and this is just the reaction, this does not include the carbon footprint for the heating etc.  I'm not against Hydrogen if it is produced cleanly which it currently is not, it is still the fossil fuel industry destroying the planet to make a buck.",MajorPain169,2025-04-26T21:23:07,4
