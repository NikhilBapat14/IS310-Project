">A two-minute-long takedown of his trade policies on MSNBC sent the president into a rage on Friday.  >“Donald Trump is backed into a corner,” said MSNBC business host Stephanie Ruhle. “His grand plans of ‘tariffs, tariffs, tariffs,’ aren’t working. You’re seeing day in and day out more business leaders—whether it’s Warren Buffett, or Jamie Dimon, or Ken Griffin—on big global stages saying, ‘This is going to crush us economically.’ And then you’ve got congressmen, senators from every state, saying to this White House, ‘Our small businesses are strangling, are dying here.’ I’m not saying Donald Trump has changed what he thinks in his heart, but he’s backed into a corner and he needs to get off this crazy tariff train, and he knows it.”",thenewrepublic,2025-05-09T15:28:20,2751

"Trump must be impeached. Here's why:  He is an adjudicated rapist.  He defrauded banks and evades taxes.  He was best friends with the pedo-pimp Jeffrey Epstein.  Many women have made convincing rape/harassment accusations against him. This is supported by a hot mic recording of Trump saying ""When you're famous, they let you grab em by the pussy.""  He has had numerous ties to the Kremlin throughout his life.  He had unsupervised unrecorded meetings with Russians at the White House with no translators present.  He extorted the Ukrainian President in an attempt to get him to spy on Biden's campaign leading up to the 2020 election.  He tried to steal the 2020 election by extorting GA officials and forging electoral certificates.  He incited an insurrection.  After the crowd had started chanting ""Hang Mike Pence"", Trump continues to blame VP Pence, effectively encouraging the crowd in their bloodlust.  He waited 187 minutes after the breach of the capitol before calling off his cult.  He was impeached a second time for the insurrection. 57 out of 100 Senators voted Guilty, but since a super majority was required, this wasn't enough for a conviction.  He hoarded classified material in a bathroom at Mar-A-Lago and when federal authorities came to collect the material, Trump willfully obstructed them.  A hot mic recording revealed that at some point, Trump had shown a portion of those classified documents to a journalist, and that he was aware of the secret classification of those documents.  He had his lawyers dig up dirt on GA prosecutor Fani Willis, to stifle the proceedings of a case he has no good defense for and ultimately delaying the case's trial till after he leaves office.  He was found guilty of 34 felony counts in a NY case where he paid off a porn star to deprive the American people of the truth of his affairs while he was campaigning in 2015.  His own appointed Judge, Aileen Cannon, neglected to recuse herself from overseeing Trump's MAL Documents case. She then did everything in her power to delay the proceedings and showed extreme bias for Trump's side.  He colluded with Elon Musk late in his campaign. Musk ran an illegal lottery and also bribed voters. He would dodge guilt by claiming that the lottery winners were actually ""paid spokespeople"" and that the bribes weren't payments for voting but for ""signing a pledge"".  He said of Elon, ""he knows those vote-counting computers.... and we won Pennsylvania, so thank you Elon!""  All this was BEFORE he took office again and started shitting all over the Constitution.  Oh, and he is a disgusting cruel petulant frat boy going on 80 with progressive dementia and incontinence.  So, as far as my grievance with tariffs and Trump's waffling, throw it on the pile.",mothyyy,2025-05-10T01:56:52,7

"Leadership means taking responsibility for your choices, being accountable for the outcomes, and maintaining the established structure.  Trump’s entire presidency has been defined by the opposite.  The man has perfected a new dark art: deflecting all blame while claiming all credit. He treats the Constitution, monogamy, and polysyllabic words with equal disdain.  Failures? Those are the domain of Democrats, losers, and anyone unwilling to swallow the gospel according to MAGA.  This warped perception of leadership is what you get when a life of unearned entitlement meets insecurity, cowardice, and what is, by most accounts and all indications, assuredly a micropenis.  It's past time to push back on this sad imitation of strength. Because this sorry bastard is just making stuff up, backed up by a cast of characters from Fox News whose only moral compass has always been defined by viewership and degrees of outrageousness.  And when the naked emperor’s castle finally, inevitably collapses, good luck finding anyone who’ll admit they ever supported his ludicrous reign.

"Who are these advisors to Trump?    Peter Navarro - He has a zealous belief in tariffs as a fundraising tool and protective shield to restore US manufacturing. Author of “The Coming China Wars” and “Death by China”.   Howard Lutnick - asked whether tariffs would cause a recession he replied, “These policies are the most important thing America has ever had — it’s worth it.”  Scott Bessent - is thought to be the most reluctant of Trump’s senior advisers on the sweeping tariff plan.  “Across a continuum, I’m not worried about inflation,” he told the Economic Club of New York last month. “Can tariffs be a one-time price adjustment? Yes.”  Jamieson Greer - is one of the key ideological proponents of funding the US Treasury not with personal taxation but a universal American tariff program.  “until about 1913 the United States government was almost entirely funded from tariff revenues, including during the latter part of the 19th century, when America truly was exploding as an international industrial powerhouse and we had a relatively high tariff rate.”  So in a nutshell we have a consorted effort to force a re-industrialization of the US.  Is it possible?  Not without improvements in efficiency.  These factories would have to be highly automated and employ as few people as possible.    And what will the impact on the economy and working class people be?  I don’t believe they really know.",128-NotePolyVA,2025-05-09T21:49:11,1

"I’ll just comment once again that *every single American* needs to be lighting up not just their federal rep’s phones and mailboxes, but their state governments as well. You need to be calling your governors, especially.   My governor, the infamous Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, is still fighting to get Trump to approve disaster aid for our state, weeks after a series of horrific spring storms unleashed tornadoes, floods, and hail that destroyed homes, businesses, vehicles, crops, equipment, and infrastructure across the state, with flooding wiping out entire bridges and sections of highway.   Now you might think, eh, she won’t listen, and neither will my red state governor, but hear me out.  These people are insulated by a small, core group of loyal sycophants, but if *every* state citizen is blowing up their voicemails and flooding their mailboxes with letters, *they’re gonna listen.* They have no choice.  Red state governments like mine are already being tossed in the trash by Trump’s government, no matter how loyal they are to him or their personal connections with him. With enough pressure, they’ll work behind the scenes to get Trump out of office at least, and while the whole admin needs to go, *that would be a great start.*  So, please, I am begging you guys to get off of Reddit, and spend that time doing something useful. Yes, I am doing my part, because I believe in democracy still despite it all, and I love my country. No American should want this nation to fail, and we *can* have a democratic government that works for all of us, but you guys have got to quit with the APATHY, because apathy *will* be your doom.",definitelynotahottie,2025-05-10T09:48:44,0

"Remind them they aren't White or Rich, and never will be by Trump's definition, or the definition of the truly rich.  They'll say ""but bro, look at my skin!""   And you can tell them ""Italians weren't considered White when they arrived in America. Rich racist assholes (RRA) called them 'garlic eaters.' They only became 'White' when rich racist assholes needed to push back against the rights of other minorities.""  The same is true for Irish folks. The Irish Potato famine was literally caused by RRA in England who deliberately caused the famine, then subjugated and arrested those Irish folks who fought back or stole food to survive. Hell, Mel Brooks did a straight up semi-ironic call out of this in Blazing Saddles. Irish folks were considered ""lesser barbarians"" by RRA up until they needed to subjugate others in America, Australia, etc.  Then hit them with the darker, deeper truth. Being ""White"" is what a RRA uses to enslave people into the system and keep them from becoming rich enough to actually walk around the true rich. That when you label someone as ""White"" you automatically point out the fact that they aren't ""of the blood"" (royalty or old money rich). That they can't even marry into that space because the ""of the blood"" RRA only allow an incestual level of intermarriage to keep money out of the poor folks' hands. That poor isn't even about how much money you have, but how much power you have just because of who you know.   Elon Musk's family aren't even allowed in RRA circles, because they were poor until they functionally enslaved their African neighbors.   Trump, Musk, Bezos, all the tech bros, etc. They aren't even allowed into true RRA circles, and all of their efforts to date are to get into that space. Trump's family will be ostracized and destroyed by RRA after Trump dies of dementia, because no one wants their genes in the RRA gene pool. Ditto Musk's.   To call yourself White is to chain yourself into slavery by others who will use you for atrocities that merit hell at the very best.   ""But bro, I don't want to be poor!""  We are all poor compared to RRA, and will remain so. My grandfather worked his ass off to rise from true poverty into serious privilege, but he was never rich in the truest sense of it. Rich is when you never need to worry about money, because someone else will always fall on their sword to keep you wealthy. People stole from my grandfather, and no one fell over themselves to restore what he earned (whether or not the amount he earned was truly reasonable). I don't regret not getting his money, because I saw [first hand] that 'privilege' for what it truly was. Rich is evil. Rich is stepping on the backs of others. Rich is being a callous, awful person, because you can reliably ignore the sacrifices of those around you.   They will never be Rich. They will never be ""of the blood.""

"I am pretty convinced it is just an effect of brainwashing. They do not actually lack empathy any more than a normal person (we all have empathy ""bandwidth"" as if we *felt* empathy for every person who deserved it we would be crippled) the trick they have managed to pull is that they have boxed up a bunch of stuff into political abstractions/icons and so bypass normal intellectual thought. More than that, they have made those abstractions the core of many people's self-identification, and so they react violently to having them challenged, even if that challenge is just recounting contrary facts.    So most of them are not arguing about things happening to real people any more than I would be if I talked about non-humans in Harry Potter. They are not seeing real people, they are just seeing the icon that has been reinforced by constant repetition.    So, it is not wrong to say it is a failure of empathy, but it is likely not something purely inherent to them, but rather a learned behavior from the informational context they live in. It is a cult, and cults are really good at teaching people to self moderate thoughts.    I think it is an important distinction because I think it is waaaay to easy to do the exact same thing in reverse, and to see all the MAGA people as an icon too. And while from a political and strategic standpoint only absolute rejection of that worldview is tolerable, I think fisling to recognize how it happens just leaves us all vulnerable to the next political cult. We need to get better at recognizing the Genesis of this at an earlier stage than when everyone has already become a fascist.    I am not sure what to do about it exactly, but I think it is something everyone needs to think about in the hopes that we will be able to avoid this next time if we all survive.",Caelinus,2025-05-09T16:59:12,127

Empathy is something that can be learned and unlearned — and even villainized. And this is doubly bad because it isn't just a failure of empathy but critical thought. There is no room for nuance in a cult that others and reduces language to those binary icons.  This isn't the first political cult in history, and you'd hope we would have learned something from those other incarnations, but sadly, it appears we didn't. There were a lot of intelligent, well-informed, articulate, and public people calling out the genesis of Western fascism over the last decade. Many people were aware and sounding the alarm, but fascism is a mass popular enthusiasm, and it isn't easy to reason with the allure of anger.  Overcoming this will require some cult deprogramming, which means changing the current legal, industrial, and technological structure of our information and communications architecture.

Although, the fascist shift really began in the 70's Nixon. When the 90's rolled around, the internet really started driving more of society. ""Driving"", is a very important point. Americans are marketing monsters. Manipulating people is a massive business in the US and it's primarily driven by the internet. The Internet has become a playground of manipulation. Many Americans are still living in some hyperreal state and they don't even realize that we're in trouble.   You gotta keep in mind, many fascist shifts are more like a frying pan and we're the frogs in it. Subtly ... Over about 50 years ... Fascists have sat there quietly pressing for More ...

"> What happened to you guys  Really, it's a bunch of things, most of it orchestrated by the republican party over teh past few decades, but some of it has it's basis in the very construction of out government.  First-past-the-post voting has forever kept the USA from having more than two political parties.  The Senate was a horrible idea, a concession to the slave-states before we had the guts to put an end to them.  Here's a cut and paste of why the Senate hurt us:  -----  -----  There are 340.1 million in America  -----  The five most populated states (127.1 million people, or **37.3%** of the US population) controls just **10%** of the senate:  CA- 39.4 million	  TX- 31.3  FL- 23.4  NY- 19.9  PA- 13.1  -----  The ten least populated states (9.69 million, or **2.84%** of the US population) controls **20%** of the senate.  NH- 1.4 million    ME- 1.4  ~~MO~~ MT- 1.1  RI- 1.1  DE- 1.0				  SD-0.9   ND- 0.8  AK- 0.74  VT- 0.65  WY- 0.6		  -----  Because of the Senate, a very small percentage of the US population has had a VERY outsized influence on what happens, and what is prevented from happening.  -----  Another issue that has been brought up, but seems to be forgotten easily is that we've been brainwashed. We had right-wing radio feeding people rage-bait and lies every day for 30 years while they drove to and from work.  Fox News jumped on the coattails of RW radio, and then became the default news station on every TV at every doctors office, dentist office, automotive shop, barber shop, etc.  The right-wing media said that other news sources couldn't be trusted, so then the brainwashing was complete - there was no one to tell them differently from all the right-wing bullshit they've been fed for decades.  After all this time, it became ingrained.    Everything they've heard for decades said democrats were evil and stupid, yet somehow clever and cunning and dangerous.  They have to protect the country from the evil, and the right-wing media will tell them how to do it, who to vote for.  The republican politicians will save the country from the evil democrats, and so everything they do is justified.  We're fucked.  Good luck guys, try to make a better world without us, would you?

"I might be using the wrong word honestly. There is a metaphorical overlap that might have caused some kind of cognitive glitch and overwritten the word I mean.   Icons are pictorial representations of complex ideas turned into simple images. So when you see an icon of a tree, despite it possibly being as simple as a green triangle and a brown rectangle, you instantly are able to understand the concept of a ""tree.""    In a similar way, when you are looking at a forest, you are seeing dozens to hundreds of trees. But unless you look at them directly, in your mind they are simplified into a bunch of ""trees"" without perfect detail. They are shorthand for what you are seeing to prevent drawing focus away from your actual conscious thoughts. the word for that *might* be icon in something I have read in the past, or I might have overwritten with the metaphor. Googling it is problematic as google just interprets icon in the first way.    My idea is that humans tend to do this with a lot of things. We categorize almost compulsively to allow us to think about complex topics quickly and easily. But this can be abused to make people think badly. So when people who watch fox news constantly hear certain key words, it overwrites the normal thought process and replaces it with a simplistic mental representative concept that shortcuts their thinking. So instead of hearing Black Youth and thinking of a young, normal black man with any number of personality traits and angecy, they think of the mental representation given to them, which is a stereotypica black ""urban"" gangster.   It is not a real person. It is a caricature, or what I am apparently calling an ""icon"" rather than an actual living human. And because it is a fiction, it is basically unassailable by facts. Even having them meet or see actual black youths with not over come it, as that ""icon"" is not related to real people. So that person they just met becomes real to them, but the collective does not.",Caelinus,2025-05-10T00:09:14,1

I will say that the “Bernie Bro” disparagement—as well as “Obama Boy” before that was disrespectful to Democratic primary voters and, as another commenter mentioned, probably drove away a lot of young male voters.   There are things I like about her, but two things always gave me pause. One was when she and her daughter told people at a rally that if they voted for Sanders, he would make sure all of their healthcare would be taken away. That, of course, was a pretty brazen lie.   The second was when she expressed such joy over Gaddafi’s assassination. She laughed and publicly bragged, “We came, we saw, he died.” Although I could understand that his death was nothing to mourn, it seemed unprofessional and below the dignity of her office to be so publicly crass and boastful.   I don’t have a problem with people liking her, but I think my reasons for being a bit uncomfortable with her are perfectly valid.

"Ok so first detaining illegal immigrants when they break the law is called enforcing the law and second they are not  citizens they do get due process in a immigration court like the garcia guy who got deported to el Salvador 2 judges order him to be deported they also found he was a member of ms13 or at least he affiliated he has the gang tattoo on his knuckles the court also denied his asylum request and his appeal. The only reason he stayed was another court put a stay order from deportation to el Salvador as he said he would be in danger or until the situationthere changes, a stay order doesn't mean stay in the country it means he has to go to another country like Mexico. So the only mistake the administration made was not to have another hearing to tell the judge look all the criminals are locked up the situation has changed he can be deported to el Salvador. So as to checks and balances let's look at the department of education, congress passed a bill creating it but it's up to the executive branch on how to run it, ie: if Trump wanted he could keep tell everyone in the department to spend all day juggling. Or take war congress only  can declare war but it's up too the president how to execute the war since he is the commander in chief. As to loyal leaders yes Trump is doing that but so do democrats like the multitude of Soros funded DA all across the country or like the AG  or DA of new York ran on Leticia James I think literally ran on putting Trump in jail, how are you supposed to uphold the law and be unbiased when you openly try to jail Republicans cause not only did they try to get Trump they tried to put his lawyers in jail for conspiracy i think I know they tried to use Rico against the lady lawyer. As to the Courts they're screwed when everyone realizes they have no enforcement mechanism if the president and congress don't listen to them the courts don't have a police force for their ruling they rely on the executive and goodwill of the people. Now as to the ""detaiment camps"" I am assuming you had just as much of a problem with them when Obama used them as they are quite literally the same camps, in fact in Obamas first term he deported more illegals than Trump in his first term, funny nickname I heard for Obama was the Deporter in Chief, also Obomber because he expanded the war in the middle east and greenlighted more drone strikes in fact he killed two American citizens by drone strike somewhere in the middle east said they were ""suspected terrorists"". Now too the baby thing is believe it's the 14 amendment that deals with birthright citizenship and there is quotes from the guy who wrote the amendment that birthright citizenship is only meant for those people who are under the jurisdiction of the USA, so if a diplomat comes to the us with his pregnant wife or she's the diplomat that there kid won't automatically get us citizenship or a pregnant lady doesn't make it across the border so her kid gets citizenship and she gets to skip the immigration line I'm sorry but they came here illegally go back and come through a port of entry I have immigrant friends who came here legally and it's a slap in the face to them that others get to just skip to the front of the line. Now about those books this is just one book so it is a anecdotal example but there is a children book for like under 10 yrs old that teaches them to do filaccio, so some books are not appropriate for children. But I understand as some of the first books the national socialists burned were books on transgenders as one of the sex changes was done in Germany in the 1930.
