Chapo Trap House called this kind of thing ‘medieval peasant brain’ and I haven’t been able to forget the term. It’s astounding to me that we are in a place where people see an odd-looking object and immediately think witchcraft is afoot.,Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-07T14:56:53,30
America really does have some of the stupidest rednecks on the planet.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-07T14:59:38,11
Dumb is going to dumber. Worth building a huge fake one with some sort of Takeshi Castle obstacle course all around it then film them trying to assault it. Would make some great TV.,EthicsGradient009,2025-05-07T15:09:48,7

I posted this earlier in the day and it got removed. Good luck!  It is relevant because it shows how loony-tunes things are.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-07T15:09:53,1

I wonder how armed groups like this would react if the government started actually kidnapping people and shipping them to foreign prisons without trial.,TheCairoKing,2025-05-07T15:43:05,1
I get it  but…  Medieval peasants weren’t walking around with pretty much super computers in their pockets.  These folks are more like mid-evil know nothing misanthropes to me.,LuvKrahft,2025-05-07T15:19:02,7

"Don't let them off that easily. I grew up in the lingering lead paint, lead in the soil from fumes, etc and lived in a city with water so polluted with industrial runoff that they made a movie about it (Dark Waters).

"The stereotype of the medieval peasant is that they were parochial, superstitious, conservative, and easily moved to group violence. Technology is different, but large parts of the US population still definitely fit that profile.",Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-07T15:56:19,9
