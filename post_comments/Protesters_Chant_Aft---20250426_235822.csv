"*Allegedly* having a conversation with him in a courtroom that witnesses documented was already echoing ""ICE is here."" Not to mention, having a conversation with what seems to be a criminal defense attorney who could advise his client within his ability on the situation that was unfolding. Additionally, it's not uncommon for Judges to meet with attorneys in their private chambers etc., Given the non-routine circumstances, rescheduling, and potential implications from witnesses who may have had to testify, it'll be interesting how that burden of both intent falls and how it was concluded to be certain. Whether that happened in the ""shortly thereafter"" doesn't seem to be mentioned in the affidavit or possibly known without statements/testimonies from the Judge, Flores-Ruiz, or his attorney (as those areas were extensions of a private area that were outside of the warrant).   Regardless, the individual seems to have been in a private location where the warrant could not have possibly been served and had to eventually somehow enter a public location. I'd expect it to fall on those serving the warrant to have a full understanding of the very few exits of that private location. The Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force clearly states that developed a plan to arrest him in a public location and should have been aware of all public exits surrounding that private perimeter. And clearly positioned to intercept him at an elevator.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-27T02:32:42,8

"Sure, but we can and should punish judges through impeachment or sanctions. Most judges *do* enjoy judicial immunity as delegated in the Constitution, and the solutions I provided are typically the proper tool to discipline judges when they step out of line. We don’t really need the president to direct his corrupt DOJ to prosecute them. That oversteps the separation of powers and encroaches on the independence of the judicial branch.

"The problem with impeachments and sanctions is that those matters are decided internally by the Judicial Branch; often by colleagues. The system is not only mired in bureaucracy, it’s also rife with conflicts of interest. The power of the Judiciary is not truly “in check” as result and Judges get away with Violations of Constitutional Rights and illegal activities on a daily basis as a result. I understand most people haven’t spent any time in a Courtroom to experience it as I have, but if you spend anytime in the Lawyertalk or Family Law subs you can see what I’m talking about. Lawyertalk is particularly eye opening when you realize Courts are mostly arbitrary and lawyers are too afraid to uphold their own Ethics obligations are filing these complaints against Judges because they go nowhere.  Based on the information available about this particular Judge and case, it sounds like she aided and abetted someone who was not only wanted by Federal Authorities, but was also in her Courtroom on Assault charges. She was right not to let ICE in her Courtroom or to stand outside the door, but committed a crime when she ushered him out the way she did. The issue with assisting a Respondent in on a Criminal Charge the way she did should be enough for Sanctions, but willfully and intentionally subverting Federal Authorities constitutes a crime you or I would 100% be arrested for no matter who is President.",SaltyinCNY,2025-04-27T12:50:26,-1

"Because it WAS unprecedented and politically motivated. Judges have immunity and proper channels for punishment which are not arrest.   No one has an obligation to assist police or ice to arrest someone and obstruction has to be a physical act on the federal level.   This was done to scare other judges and show separation of power doesn’t exist. They had no legal authority to make an arrest, only impeach or sanction the judge for their actions.

"Doesn’t matter if she was or was not. ICE warrants are administrative warrants that they themselves sign, not judicial warrants. It allows them to attempt to apprehend but nobody is under any obligation to aide them in doing so. The judge viewed the bullshit warrant, told them that it has no real authority in her court, which it didn’t, and then made a decision about how said warrant would be interpreted in her court, which she has the right to do as a judge. She’s within her legal rights to tell this person to use the back door of her courtroom to exit.

"If it were you or I who did it, we would absolutely be arrested no matter who was President. I can agree that the guy should be protected while in her Courtroom during her Proceedings ; maybe even in the Courthouse, but once that matter Adjourned and he stepped outside he was under the jurisdiction of Federal Agents. The guy was in for Assault Charges. If he was guilty and sent to Jail she wouldn’t be able to protect him; instead she skipped the matter and helped the guy try to evade.  I think the problem is too many people have blind faith and a lack of understanding of the system and process for Sanctioning and Impeaching Judges. There’s a ton of red tape; it’s expensive; it very rarely ever happens because those matters are handled internally by the Judiciary; and Judges have Immunity. They are largely unchecked and get away with a ton of illegal activities. It kills me to hear lawyers like Letitia James claim “no one is above the law” when she knows full well about the Immunity Judges are granted.

"FBI has more ""power"" in terms of responsibility and areas of scope, however ""citizen duty to assist"" remains the same.  I've had to review some situations from an adjacent approach and my assumption is that the exit used was marked as an exit or at least understood by courthouse staff that it was commonly used as an exit. This basically means the agents on site did not do their job of securing the site. They assumed the target would walk right to them, in a public building, which by law has to have multiple public exits.  It may be considered ""unfair"" for the target to be allowed to use an alternate exit route, but good luck determining it was illegal action by courthouse officials.",donnerpartytaconight,2025-04-27T07:41:12,1
