Under Biden's economy Rubio only needed 1 job to make ends meet.,Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-04T16:02:13,1973
"***From Rolling Stone’s Peter Wade:***  Secretary of state, acting administrator for USAID, acting lead archivist, acting national security adviser. Marco Rubio, the politician Trump once dubbed “little Marco,” has become the president’s go-to guy for big roles in the administration. But Democrats are casting doubt on whether it is possible for Rubio — or anyone — to balance all of those jobs.

It's probably impossible to walk the tight rope of being palatable to people who hate Trump while staying on Trump's good side in federal politics. Why Rubio would trade a relatively secure senate job for Secretary of State to a moron who likes to play the you are fired game is one of the bigger head scratchers I've ever seen. I can't tell if Rubio genuinely saw this as some duty to check Trump's worst impulses or if he was dumb and saw this as an opportunity for the spotlight. Regardless it made no sense. Rubio's whole brand was being the respectable establishment Republican. Knifing Ukraine in the back was never going to endear him to his base of his support and he's never going to have genuine populist bona fides.  It's somewhat unfortunate as prior to this I kind of respected Marco. Yeah he's a political survivor who read the room correctly in 2021 and carried water for Trump but he's one of like 3 Republican senators who writes serious legislation.
