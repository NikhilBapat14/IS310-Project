The Conservatives won 20+ additional seats in parliament than they had.  In any other cycle this would have been a huge win for them.  The issue that propelled  Liberals to history wasn’t Donald Trump it was the collapse of the nonsense third parties in Canada.  The NDP and Bloc both collapsed and their votes went to Liberals causing their win even though they underperformed in their own traditional strongholds.    To put it into more American terms the Liberals lost seats in Toronto which would be like the Democrats losing in New York and Los Angeles.  But because they’re not a two party system up there the little offshoot parties falling apart meant those votes had to go somewhere and so the Liberals still won.,Grease2310,2025-04-29T06:22:49,200

"Libs were doing bad while Poilievre sat there doing nothing and stayed out of the spot light. This was fine and pushed people towards a conservative vote. Once Trudeau stepped down, Carney stepped up, there was a lot positive attention for the libs and cons still sat there doing nothing. Poilievre spent the last 4 years with the slogan of “Fuck Trudeau” but didn’t have the spine to stand up against Trump’s 51st state threats. The cons were coasting on a do nothing win and when the political landscape changed they had nothing ready to go and didn’t pick up on the easy PR within Canadian media.   Carney also did a good job of pulling back swing voters by introducing popular conservative policies into his own campaign and meeting more in the middle. Many Canadians were looking for a middle ground unity in the face of threats to our sovereignty and Carney provided. It’s honestly just a showing of how incompetent Poilievre was as a leader and it’s been a problem with the cons for the last few elections.   Canada and USA are not the same political landscape and our recent conservative administrations have failed to notice that. They need to stop trying to follow in the foot steps of American politics and just come up with their own platforms that are popular in Canada based on what their constituents want.",psyfi66,2025-04-29T13:46:57,45

Bloc lost a lot of seats because Quebecers only listen to far left news in French who brainwashed them 24/7 with ''Trump bad!!!'' rhetoric, and NDP nuked itself in order to prop up the Liberals again.

"I don't understand why people think carbon tax is a liberal policy and not a conservative one. In the US it has mostly been moderates in both parties who have supported it, and there have been plenty of Republicans who have supported it.  Carbon tax can go hand-in-hand with conservative policy, as you can use the revenue from it to lower other, more damaging taxes such as payroll tax and income tax. You can also pare it with removal of pollution caps and things like fuel efficiency mandates.  If done right, carbon tax can be a win-win where the free market leads to a greater total reduction of pollution, yet with an increase in wealth creation and business activity. I have trouble understanding why so many people still oppose it, and yet support the status quo of our *incredibly high* payroll tax and income tax. Like doesn't payroll tax make you just fuming mad? Taxing work and employment at a very high rate? Isn't this the exact opposite of what we want? We're punishing businesses for creating jobs and punishing people for working?

Even though it's not true, Carney was seen as the change candidate not Pierre who came across as a typical politician.

Look at France and Romania where they literally have to ban the populists from running...  This is the third time in a row the Canadian ""conservative"" party has run a Mitt Romney campaign.

"> Trump is the moderate conservative  Explain to me how non-stop executive overreach so extreme that you have a 6-3 conservative majority on the supreme court, and the court is still ruling against you, is ""moderate""?

Do you even know what the word ""moderate"" means? Just because you can pin Trump's policy stances on a board and average them and find they are somewhere close to the middle does not mean the man is moderate, and just because they're right-of-center doesn't mean he is conservative. In the case of Trump, it's more because he's incoherent and his stances are all over the map, and always have been. And many of his stances are extreme, bizarre even, and he changes them as fast as he replaces the people in his administrations. This kind of wild instability is neither conservative nor moderate and it makes me feel like my head is going to explode that so many people don't seem to understand these basic facts even when they're staring them in the face and have been for years.  The moderate candidate was John Kasich in 2016. I voted for him in the primary. There has not been a moderate on the GOP ticket since then. In the current US political environment, a moderate on the GOP ticket would win any general election in a landslide.

I would imagine that campaigns are likely acting on the advice of their internal polling and making decisions based on that. You’re right that the media narrative is what is driving the anti-Trump thought in Canada, but the unfortunate reality is that people are susceptible to the influence of media in Canada. If the last three election campaigns have shown anything, it’s that the CBC has the majority of the electorate in the palm of its hand.   I will say there is some previous political precedent for this type of movement not working back when the Reform and Canadian Alliance Parties existed in the 1990s and early 2000s. Preston Manning and Stockwell Day led truly right wing parties that dominated the political scene in Western Canada, but were not able to ever break through. They had one seat in Ontario after 1993 and lost it in 1997, essentially becoming a regionalized western political party. It was when the party merged with a more progressive party to form the Conservative Party that they gained national recognition.

If not, there'll be a Democrat Congress that would put an end to many of the tariffs and impeach the President literally one second after they take over.",cathbadh,2025-04-30T15:22:50,2
"What does that have to do with a price of bread? Poli was running for election in Canada. If Trump did a mistake, it doesn’t excuse Poli from making one. It’s ok to admit that there may be differences with Trump, instead of folding and losing the entire lead in less than 3 months. ",Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-29T06:03:38,-20
"Canadian elections just don't matter that much. I'm sorry to break that to you but this means quite little to the US at the moment. I'd be considered if the POTUS was stopping to think about what the Canadian electorate thought of his actions. He is not, and that is the correct choice.",Jibrish,2025-04-29T08:45:55,-11
That will happen before the end of this year. China is already sitting down factories and could experience a recession this year. There no reason to think Canada will fair better.,DickCheneysTaint,2025-04-30T15:43:20,0
The problem is they see Trump as a threat.  At first the 51st state thing was funny and trolling Trudeau was comical but Trump should have let that go after Trudeau left.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-29T07:45:02,63
"> China is already sitting down factories and could experience a recession this year.  A recession?  Their economy expanded 5.4% this quarter, exceeding expectations, while ours contracted.  They still have the rest of the planet to sell to, and, with Trump doing his best to drive away every single trading partner we have, many of them will turn to China.  Hell, I bet China would give Canada fantastic deals, especially if they decided to give them military basing rights.  It's wild you think everything will be better for us and everyone else will be destroyed somehow in about a year and a half when the numbers are already trending the opposite direction as a consequence of these non-conservative economic policies.",cathbadh,2025-04-30T19:09:58,2
But Trudeau didn’t leave. Carney replaced him. It’s basically Trudeau 2.0,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-29T13:31:43,-2
