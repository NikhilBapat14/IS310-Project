"It is odd that we have more 4 star generals right now than we had at the height of WWII, when the military was multiple times larger than it is today.    It's almost like ranks were handed out as a form of political patronage. ",Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-06T05:21:52,170
"We have more admirals than we have ships in the Navy, which is ridiculous.",WoodEyeLie2U,2025-05-06T05:53:05,78
He should start with 20+yr flag officers who have never drawn hostile fire pay.,crash______says,2025-05-06T06:56:07,23
Excellent. Need to cut that back to the same ratio as prior to or during WWII of generals to soldiers.,deadzip10,2025-05-06T07:12:52,8

"Prior to WWII, the Army Chief of Staff was the only 4 star general, no there was no 3-star generals, save for brevet promotions iirc. The highest rank obtainable in the army was 2-star.",MartinLutherCreamJr,2025-05-06T17:14:25,6
"Reminds me of a corporation I worked for, years ago. They had so many VPs and Directors, it was ridiculous.   This included people who were “Director” or “VP” over a one-person department…not in charge of anyone. It was stupid. They collected the pay and enjoyed the perks of that position but didn’t have to manage any people. It was a handout position for political purposes, no doubt in my mind.",ITrCool,2025-05-06T06:55:25,24
"I'll agree it's how they get rid of problems today. That doesn't mean it *should* be that way. The correct response to incompetence should be public humiliation and removal from command, not  quiet promotion and a leisurely stroll to overpaid consultancy.",Yoinkitron5000,2025-05-06T09:13:38,13
Sounds good to me ….,deadzip10,2025-05-06T18:41:05,2
