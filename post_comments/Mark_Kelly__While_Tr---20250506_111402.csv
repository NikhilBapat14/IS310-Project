"He knows what he is doing.  Despite interviewing with Welker, he is speaking to his base (via the clip\[s\] being picked up and run by Fox).   He may be a lot of things, but underestimating Trump's intelligence when it comes to the media and messaging is not a good tactic.   And remember, if you disagree with the message you are not in the target audience.",crucial_geek,2025-05-06T12:44:52,3
I want to see commercials running in red states with Trump saying kids don't need 30 dolls. It's so utterly tone deaf.,hansn,2025-05-06T11:32:37,1
I‚Äôm going to disagree with this. He‚Äôs declared bankruptcy 6 times. Been given millions of dollars in legal penalties. Hell his own lawyer covered the bill for payoffs at one point.  He‚Äôs just never felt consequences because of a non-stop grift and faucet of feeble minded enablers.  Consequences are just something he can‚Äôt comprehend because they don‚Äôt apply to him. So he doesn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶ nothing hurts,mzcuriosity,2025-05-06T11:48:33,1

All these stupid statements and Pope dress up etc is actually flood zoning. Media bites one out of ten. Directs focus away from Project 2025. The want the V amendment and they are getting closer,trastamara22,2025-05-06T20:14:13,1

"Trump is a good showman moron whisperer, sure, but it does not require skills or intelligence to do that type of messaging. Proposing real policy is hard. Making up fake issues is easy.  People in the US have already been conditioned for decades by right wing media to absorb logical fallacies and vile talking points.   All Trump has to do is repeat the same lies over and over and the media carries the water all the way for him. It require no effort or intelligence to get them to do that, they're already poised to do it by default because they all compete and crave the ratings.   He's just profiting from the media ecosystem that was already there and they're more then happy to promote him.",baz4k6z,2025-05-06T14:17:20,2
"For as much shit as Trump talks about the so called MSM, he says yes to nearly every invite.  For every click bait headline question he is asked ""uh, are you seeking a third term?"", he knows to play with it because his response will get more clicks and get jeers from libs and cheers from his base.  Trump goes to sporting events.  He did photo ops at a McDonalds and riding a garbage truck.  Granted, it doesn't take that many working brain cells to do, but he does not shy away from receiving attention.  People from all sides report that he is pleasant and respectful when off camera.  So call it what you want.    About right wing media.  Sure, it's been around for a while but it was mostly an 'other' thing.  It didn't really start to become what it is now until the 2010s and then Trump.  Fox News as a cable channel did not pop up until 1996, and mostly came into fame for their non-stop, CNN like reporting, of 9/11 and then later the Iraq War.  The far-right integration didn't happen until around 2020 or so.  As for media in general, and I am not talking about the independent outlets, You Tubers, etc., is that they are ultimately controlled by the board and parent company.  In way or another, it comes down to money, and right now if your outlet is owned by Disney, Paramount,  they want their journalists to play nice so their mergers and acquisitions are approved.",crucial_geek,2025-05-07T12:19:40,2
