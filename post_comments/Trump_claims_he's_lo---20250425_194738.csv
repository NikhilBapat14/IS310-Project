"Why are they even asking this stupid question. Title should read ‚ÄúTrump lies again‚Äù .  Every one of us goes to the market 1 or many more times a week.  Like it‚Äôs written in stone‚Ä¶ the prices are right there. Egg prices have not fallen 92%. Maybe 92 cents. He don‚Äôt know the difference, and that‚Äôs just another problem.   Groceries‚Ä¶.

"> Betteridge's law of headlines is an adage that states: ""Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.""

">On Sunday mornings Squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. The animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion. All the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food.",Still_Mix3277,2025-04-25T20:16:24,2
"Of course not. Any incidental lowering of prices on any given goods are absolutely not something he caused. His policies have been almost entirely inflationary, and usually severely so. It's a miracle prices haven't skyrocketed.",enjoycarrots,2025-04-25T19:53:04,1
The fat fuck has no idea what things cost. When was the last time he bought food? Never. I bet he hasn't picked up a check at a restaurant in 30 years. I take that back. He bought McDonald's for that football team once.,papaHans,2025-04-25T20:16:19,1

"He's lowered European oil and gas prices, which is nice of him.   He's lowered the price I pay for exchanging my currency to USD when paying for things in USD.    He's also lowered share prices on the US markets.   So yes, for once his claims are accurate. I'm not sure if this is what he had in mind though.",XenorVernix,2025-04-26T05:44:45,1
