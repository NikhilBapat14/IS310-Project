"Isn't ""charity"" a word Republicans use as codeword for ""a little somethin' somethin' on the side, wink wink""? Look at Trump family's ""charities"", and various politicians in red states siphoning money to theirs and their benefactors' pockets. And wasn't there that Las Vegas council woman who was pardoned by Trump after using ""charity"" to pay for her plastic surgeries?",Niceguy955,2025-04-30T16:28:21,13

Leave Desantis alone! Nothing wrong with politicians washing taxpayer funds as long as it’s not a dem doing it! Desantis is rich and smart so is his wife and you’d all do the same thing he and Rick Scott did,Resident_War5075,2025-04-30T17:24:07,1
