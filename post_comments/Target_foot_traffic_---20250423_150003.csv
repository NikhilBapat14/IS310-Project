"I was already avoiding them because they kept blasting shitty country music. In california. I have no idea why they became so obsessed with taking Walmart's customer base when they already had their own, stable customer base that hated walmart.   The people who shop at walmart aren't going to hear the country music, or see the anti-DEI bullshit, because they are shopping at a walmart as we speak.  But the entire target customer base is fucking pissed. Absolutely baffling.  I hate that most shopping consists of the Amazon/Walmart/Target trifecta. When they're all fascist supporting scumbags it becomes a lot harder to just easily pick something up.
