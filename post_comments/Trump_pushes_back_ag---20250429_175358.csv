"How exactly is China gonna eat those tariffs? Like they would voluntarily lower their own prices before selling to the US to offset OUR own tariffs?  As comedian Josh Johnson quipped, ""...maybe don't get in a math contest with China.""",utti,2025-04-29T18:01:42,46

"Stop letting that fat orange fuck push back, and start (and don't stop) pushing HIM back. Who gives a shit if he storms out of interviews? You don't counter a petty, thin-skinned narcissist by being nice. You counter them by absolutely destroying their veneer of self-righteous bullshit. Talk over him. Insult him. Make him rage. You have to bully the bully. Nothing makes a narcissist fuck-up more than that. And the more he fucks up, the harder it will be for others to keep sane-washing him. And that will lead to an even steeper decline in support. Enough so, that the GOP sycophants in the house & senate might stop coddling his balls if they see his outside support dwindling.  ",overfiend1976,2025-04-29T18:05:57,26

"At every opportunity given, Trump displays no depth of his understanding of the situations he has deliberately created.

He’s so mindblowingly stupid. China is not paying the tarrifs. We are. It’s been explained over and over again to him and he refuses to understand basic logic.  UPPAbaby and Nina have jacked their prices up already for tarrifs. Hexclad is saying they’re gonna raise prices because of tarrifs. Those prices likely won’t ever come down. We’re getting screwed.  Congress could stop this literally today and refuses to do their job.,greyhoundbrain,2025-04-29T18:05:13,9

"Funny thing is if he did something like 2-5% they MIGHT get some suppliers to adjust prices a bit to help. Hell, China might even subsidise it. It would be a kerfuffle and comes would see price creep, but it would not disrupt trade with China in a major way.   Nobody is going to ""eat"" 145% and at that point except for a very narrow category of goods, it is effectively an embargo rather than a tariff.   And no matter how many times people who have some basic grasp on world trade and economics try to explain this to people who do not, these dumb motherfuckers are just going to keep drinking the Trump Kool-Aid until the shelves are literally empty.

"As a Chinese, I think your president is sick in the head.  Manufacturing typically makes 10-20% profit, and producing a 10 RMB item typically sells for 11 or 12 RMB.  Now you place an order with China, pay the Chinese supplier 12 RMB for an item, and at the same time ask the Chinese supplier to pay your customs 18 RMB in tariffs.  Instead of making a profit, we make a loss of at least 45% on the production of an item.  What business would accept such an order?  Why don't we go home and sleep?Or to manufacture orders from other countries?",bjran8888,2025-04-29T20:01:13,1
