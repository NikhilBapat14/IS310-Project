It's a funding thing.  It's much easier to direct/appropriate funds for declared disasters.,gsfgf,2022-08-16T10:15:58,38
"There are funds which are only accessible under state of emergency. Including some federal funds.  On top of this it allows the executive, for a short time, to take actions which normally are not allowed without state legislature approval. Essentially it allows a short term dictatorship to allow things to move as quickly as the emergency requires.  Typically they must be short lived or redeclared every 30-90days, depending on the rules of the state.",korinth86,2022-08-16T10:27:50,30
It gives the government emergency powers amongst other things. The wikipedia article has a great breakdown of the legal implications for multiple countries:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency#United_States,TScottFitzgerald,2022-08-16T10:24:10,8
Everyone is mentioning funding but it is also for the deployment of the national guard if required....,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T10:37:11,5
"In my state, the governor gets to bypass Congress (or the mayor gets to bypass city council) to speed up the process and allocate funds for emergencies   Congress has a check in place that they can vote to revoke the emergency state",[deleted],2022-08-16T11:28:45,2
"Access to funds, troops and other amenities become available through this declaration. Governors can allocate reserve funds and divert other resources to aide. They can  request special federal assistance for anything falling within the purview of said declaration.",MonetaryMust,2022-08-16T16:22:28,1
You get to do a bunch of shitty things you don't normally get to do. Actually I meant the government. Not you. You actually get to do fewer things you used to be able to do.,hahaha01357,2022-08-16T20:40:55,1
"A bit concerning. I'm still reviewing the wiki which is huge, but my first thought is that a governor or other leader would be inclined to declare a state of emergency, or perhaps facilitate one being created, in order to receive these funds. I'm curious how this declaration is vetted or what checks the federal government conducts before accepting the declaration.",dataBlockerCable,2022-08-18T09:58:42,1
I'm assuming state defense forces have a similar requirement?,ArchdukeAlex8,2022-08-16T11:17:33,2
To get federal money it also has to be a federal declared disaster.,gsfgf,2022-08-18T10:12:42,1
"The national guard is the state defense force. They are run by each of the governors. The federal government cannot deploy the national guard without approval of the governor in which the guard originates, even when called up for active duty abroad.",DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T11:21:47,2
"This is both true and not; after the partial federalising of the National Guard, 'State Defense Forces' were legalised by the US Congress in 1956, and 22 states have them. If you are ever in the US and you see someone in a military uniform but with a state flag on the shoulder instead of the national one, they're in the State Defense Force and not the National Guard or the professional services.  Michigan's is called the [""Michigan Defense Force""](https://midefenseforce.org/).",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-08-16T11:46:53,9
We have a separate state defense force.  They're civilians and mostly do disaster recovery stuff.,gsfgf,2022-08-16T11:55:27,2
Very interesting - I did not know this existed. Thank you for enlightening me! Wow.!,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T12:25:10,2
Found out that it's 22 plus Puerto Rico!,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T17:14:29,1
Where do you live? In the states?,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-16T12:19:38,2
