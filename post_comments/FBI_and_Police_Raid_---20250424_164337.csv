"All of that over a stupid ass protest? Most colleges have student activists protesting something. Not unusual at all, but they are acting like these kids are pro-ISIS or pro-Taliban or some shit.   The only way I could see this being justifiable is if someone showed up to a protest with a Hamas flag. That's someone worth looking into.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-24T16:47:30,7

"Michigan Democrat AG Dana Nessel ran the operation.  \----------------------  *Nessel has refused to confirm whether the raids were connected to Palestine activism thus far, but her office has aggressively targeted the movement. Last fall, Nessel introduced criminal charges against at least 11 protesters involved in the University of Michigan Gaza encampment.*  *An investigation by The Guardian revealed that members University of Michigan’s governing board had pressed Nessel to bring charges against the students. The report notes that six of eight regents donated more than $33,000 combined to Nessel’s campaigns.*  *After the regents called for action, Nessel took the cases over from local District Attorney Eli Savit, an extremely rare move, as local prosecutors typically handle such charges.*  *“The University of Michigan’s alleged frustration with local prosecutors stems from a November campus sit-in at which Ann Arbor police arrested a group of 40 protesters,” explains The Guardian investigation. “\[Savit had\] announced in May that his office would dismiss 36 cases and recommend four for diversion programs where they faced a light punishment.”*  *“That incensed U-M’s pro-Israel regents and police department because they wanted swifter, tougher charges, according to sources with knowledge of the process..,” it continues. “They then asked Nessel to take the cases and university police sent warrant requests to her office.”*",MentalTourniquet,2025-04-24T17:08:01,14
Every Pro Palestine person I know who was shitting on Biden on their instagram stories stopped posting them shortly after the election. Those fuckwits finally realized they only had one realistic option and they just blew it for the sake of a purity test.,DREWCAR89,2025-04-24T17:43:46,8

"Florida fascist rapist republican Donald ""Putin's cock sleeve"" Trump provided cover for this shit.   > The mounting repression in Michigan comes amid a wider, nationwide crackdown on the Palestine movement from the Trump administration.  > In recent weeks, the government has revoked hundreds, possibly thousands, of student visas, many from individuals who have protested against the genocide in Gaza or criticized Israel publicly.  > This week Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) and Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) Jim McGovern (D-MA), Troy Carter (D-LA), and Bennie Thompson (D-MS) traveled to an immigration facility in Louisiana to meet with Tufts doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk and recent Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil, who are both facing deportation proceedings over their support for Gaza.  > “We can’t stand by while the Trump Administration violates free speech and unlawfully detains people with no due process,” tweeted Pressley.",Ok_Mixture4917,2025-04-24T17:23:22,0

"They are not being prosecuted for protesting. There’s allegedly $100K in damages. But since we luckily have a democratic administration in Michigan, they will get their day in court, and the facts will come out. If innocent, they should get some sort of restitution.  IF they are guilty, I want the book thrown at them.",inconsistent3,2025-04-25T06:11:27,-1

"I know they aren't being prosecuted for protesting, I read the article. You also cannot be prosecuted for that lol. But I find it hilarious that so many commenters are defaulting to ""and they said x about the dems"" in response to this, which makes no sense when the AG is an elected democrat. You understand the lack of sense there?  As to the rest--I never heard of FBI prosecuting vandalism before. It's so unusual though, that the protesting feels quite relevant here--this feels like intimidation, bc the property damage excuse is really thin. This is a dramatic overreach by any standard.",bouguerean,2025-04-25T08:51:54,0
