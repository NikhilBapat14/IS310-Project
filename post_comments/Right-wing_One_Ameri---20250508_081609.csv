"Protests should be held at these right wing propaganda outlets since they’re the ones rotting our friends, family, and neighbors brains.",Be-skeptical,2025-05-08T08:24:33,28
"People have a tendency to blame Fox for the brain rot. Truth is, One America News and NewsMax far outweigh Fox in the sheer depravity of their deceit. The propaganda is vile, and the morons are glued to it all day. Viewer base is enormous.   Now they will spew their brainwashing to the world?  This is really,  really, bad.  Edit: We shouldn’t be dismissive of the implications of this. The sensibilities of Democrats are going to really hurt us in the long run.  We are deer in the headlights of pure evil. ",lr99999,2025-05-08T08:37:35,14

Makes sense have a right wing anti immigrant Xenophobic Media organization provide the feed to the Voice of America. Who better to send the message to the World stay away we don’t want foreigners and immigrants to our great country. We’re the City on the Hill with our beacon of liberty that will welcome you with a Gold Card citizenship for the pittance of $5 Million dollars.,johnn48,2025-05-08T18:14:32,1
"I question every day why is it legal for companies / judges / officials outside of a direct political career to have any political affiliation? Voting is private, you aren't allowed to decide what others should vote for so why is manipulating it to the point of almost no choice legal? Even at work I turn on my PC and MSN is posting political opinions as news.   I've been voting since I was 20 years old, every 2 years, and after almost 20 years of doing it I have to say I'm very disappointed in our choices, I only really vote Democrat because Republicans legitimately stand against the things I want, but Democrats are in no shape or form a representative of what I would like, nor have they been very useful to stop republicans, even when they win. I truly feel if we had better leaders to vote for, this ""news"" would never have even existed.",RainbowIcee,2025-05-08T08:56:06,0
"This is a coup. What we think doesn’t matter. This is all about our Congress.  Seven Republicans could end this. It’s all about Compromat.  They have been compromised by money, threats, and being on the “in” during our destruction. Why do you think they have done nothing while Trump has stolen their power? I mean, they let him set the fucking tariffs?!   I live in a red state. A few of these traitors live within 5 miles of me. ",lr99999,2025-05-08T08:49:09,11
Fox was the first and set off the slippery slope. Does it bring a twisted satisfaction that even it is being left behind? Sure.,manticore16,2025-05-08T08:42:18,4

">I've been voting since I was 20 years old, every 2 years,   You know that elections are held every year, right? One of the reasons we're in this mess is that people don't bother to vote in state and local elections and even fewer vote in primaries. Those are every bit as important as the Federal elections. Want better candidates? Vote in primaries and tell your friends to do the same.",Sad_Importance7789,2025-05-08T10:17:53,1
Rush Limbaugh was the real beginning. His initial financing was paid for by the  original American Nazis.     Thinking about Rush makes me wish there’s a hell.,lr99999,2025-05-08T09:02:31,4
"To vote in preliminaries you have to join the party, I won't do such as I sadly don't believe neither have good intentions, I hold off on the chance some non R or D will rise and I'll support them. Which is my complaint, Dems don't do what people vote them for.   State elections (senators and representative) are every 2 years not every year.   Other elections are dependant on City, State and municipality, some don't happen for a long while such as Mayor or judges.   Where I live there aren't elections every year, that's either some odd coincidence or in the middle of too many political circumstances ",RainbowIcee,2025-05-08T10:51:38,1
