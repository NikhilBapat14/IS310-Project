Judges can also deputize whoever they want. Time for them to build their own mini-armies.,InfinityComplexxx,2025-04-25T11:13:26,438
"> There is no evidence that Mr. Trump has contemplated revoking security from judges. But Judge Sullivan’s remarks were an extraordinary sign of the extent of judges’ anxiety over the threats facing the federal bench. And they highlight a growing discomfort from judges that their security is handled by an agency that, through the attorney general, ultimately answers to the president, and whose funding, in their view, has not kept pace with rising threats.  The FBI just arrested a judge for letting an immigrant and their attorney escape a Gestapo (ICE) raid on the court.   > “Cutting all the security from one judge or one courthouse — stuff like that hasn’t happened, and I don’t expect it to,” said Jeremy Fogel, a retired federal judge who directs the Berkeley Judicial Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, and is in frequent contact with current judges. “But, you never know. Because it’s fair to say that limits are being tested everywhere. Judges worry that it could happen.”  Yet another expert who thinks the system is still intact despite all the evidence to the contrary.",ExZowieAgent,2025-04-25T11:24:57,85

"Not a Downer question. Essentially, they would attempt to arrest each other, each claiming authority to do so. The judges would claim their orders weren't being followed and violated, and would correctly be in the right in this regard. The DOJ would weakly try to claim the judge's orders wouldn't be valid.  The SCOTUS would have to step in and give their weight, which would assuredly be supporting the lower judges (knowing the recent 9-0 ruling against Trump, it seems SCOTUS isn't having any of Trump's BS).  If Trump/DOJ refused after THAT in addition to trying to arrest the deputized officials, we would then blown past a Constitutional crisis and basically enter a full-on mini-civil war. At that point, it'd be the military hopefully stepping in.     SO basically, it could get very ugly, very fast. But that all depends on what Trump/DOJ do. The end game, if they take it as far as I outlined, doesn't look pretty to them.",InfinityComplexxx,2025-04-25T14:37:35,3
