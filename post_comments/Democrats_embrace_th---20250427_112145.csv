Dems should have embraced it a long time ago: Fuck Trump.  https://preview.redd.it/azc9nbmy5fxe1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0996c47fd8a442fa55d05a8ba9fd72ad46a504f2,dantekant22,2025-04-27T13:18:07,12
I guess this is indicative of the party being less concerned with things like etiquette which is a small factor into how we have lost the working class and why young people don’t feel at all passionate about democratic candidates. A lot of people younger than me recognize the Dems as being more sane but find them “cringe” which translates to them not at being enthusiastic about voting and so they don’t even try and influence their peers or want to talk about politics with them.,KarachiKoolAid,2025-04-27T12:27:33,15

"When I was a kid the f bomb was fart.  It was illegal to say on TV.   How times have changed.  And in a related story, several high ranking Conservative officials, noted for their constant use of racial slurs and their condemnation of the ""woke mob"", have come out and condemned the Left for their use of profanity, claiming it is inappropriate, indecent, and needs to be banned from public discourse.",tinyE1138,2025-04-27T16:50:02,2

Wonder if anyone has a count of how many Republican elected officials and high-visibility supporters like Evangelical preachers are caught with CP or actually molesting a child or attempting to. Seems like a new one every week.  But what else should we expect from the party of family values and Christian morality that elected Epstein's best friend and someone who openly sexualizes his own daughter and walked into an underage beauty pageant dressing room and then bragged about it.  Grand Old Party? Gang of Pedophiles.,Agnosathe,2025-04-28T03:08:21,3

> “cringe”  It’s more like they just don’t know Dems because they rely on social media and alternative media where Dems have very weak presence compared to Republicans.

"Well yeah the major issue with a lot of young people is that they are not politically active or aware. Whats “cringe” is that often the type of outreach Democrats engage in feels outdated. For example elements of the Harris campaign felt like it was being targeted at young people in 2016 not in 2024. While Republicans come off as psycho they often come off as more sincere. A lot of the democrats messaging, especially on social issues does sound very academic and sometimes it comes off as “we know what’s best for you because you don’t”.",KarachiKoolAid,2025-04-27T20:30:15,2
