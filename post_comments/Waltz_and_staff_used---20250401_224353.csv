"Obligatory ""but her emails...""  Archive link: https://archive.is/wYPqC",undercurrents,2025-04-01T22:44:40,6
It astounds me to this day that the government hasn't contracted an in-house software development team specifically for the creation of a proprietary and secure means of confidential communication. The fact that we can even speculate about the use of a commercial email service by the people with access to our most dangerous information should be embarrassing.,Dirk_McGirken,2025-04-02T01:12:45,4

I'm pretty sure the US government has dedicated secure encrypted email servers and other communication methods.   These guys are doing worse things than Hilary did with her email server.,blocked_user_name,2025-04-02T05:05:13,4
