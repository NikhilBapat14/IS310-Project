"I hate this.   His campaign staff were *brilliant.* They flipped a Senate seat in an extremely tough year, when their candidate had a fucking stroke and could barely speak during the debate.  I loved them. Every one of them busted their ass for a cause they believed in, and they won.  This is the thanks they get? This is the result of all that work? Talk about demoralizing. . . I hope all of those staff are picked up and have great careers. Given what they accomplished in getting him elected, they deserve it.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-08T09:10:47,134
"Guy had a stroke and it fucked up his brain chemistry. Not unheard of.  Hate to say it but the MAGAs were right on this one. After his stroke he probably was unfit for office. It was better he won than Oz, that hasn't changed, but Fetterman is obviously no longer the same guy as he was before the stroke, his brain has deteriorated. That video of him refusing to put on his seatbelt so a plane could take off is not normal healthy behavior. His brain has been turned into mashed potatoes and who knows what reality he believes he's living in anymore",TaxGuy2930,2025-05-08T09:21:22,29
"Fetterman has clinical depression and is told to relax from his job.  Millions of other Americans have clinical and or worse ( stage 4 depression) dysthymia and they're just told to go with the flow and deal with it.

" > Fetterman, a 6-foot-8 former college offensive tackle, *started yelling at the group of five union representatives, asking what they wanted from him as he banged his fists on the table.*  People who have strokes often suffer from an increase in selfish, petulant and outburst behaviors. He has no business remaining in office if he thinks it’s okay to behave like this. I’ve had a weird vibe ever since he was allowed to dress like a slob in the name of “accommodation”, this is too much.   >“*Here’s what is true: We had a spirited conversation about our collective frustration with the Trump administration’s cuts to our education system,*” Fetterman said in a statement to The Inquirer. “As a proud product of PSEA, I will always support our teachers, and I will always reject anyone’s attempt to turn Pennsylvania’s public schools into a voucher program.”  If you need to start your sentence with “this is what’s true”….",indicatprincess,2025-05-08T12:20:25,8

"In fairness to Fetterman it's not like he's doing this intentionally, nor is it reasonable for them to have expected this after his stroke. You don't know how someone's brain is affected until much later, and unfortunately we're now seeing it play out. He's not a healthy individual, and now it needs addresses, but I would hesitate to blame or criticize him for it directly. He wouldn't choose to be like this. He's likely having early dementia symptoms.",TaxGuy2930,2025-05-08T09:23:51,36
"I mean, his staff have been covering up the fact he’s clearly unfit for office and broke his wife’s spine probably while reading tweets on his iPad while driving. So I would hope that his entire staff never works in politics ever again. ",captainInjury,2025-05-08T18:08:31,1
"He was also an asshole before the stroke which people seem to not know about or ignored. So his change in personality probably looks more severe than it is.

"If you knew  you were sick, and still continued to do your job, because people relied on you, you'd think you were a hero.  He's sick. He's not doing his job and people are in critical condition right now and him not showing up hurts.  Every time he doesn't vote, it feels more like he's just surrendering to the republican whims.  At this point, he should just live in the office and have someone roll him into vote. They do it with those senile republicans, why not do it with a stroked' democrat?",SunshineSkies82,2025-05-08T09:44:03,32
"I understand. But there’s a decent chance that some of his campaign staff are now on his actual staff, and they’re either being traumatized on the regular, or asked to cover up behavior until they can’t cover it up anymore.  That can also be a hard bell to unring. I’m not judging Fetterman, I just feel terrible for his staff.  That moment where his own staffer broke down crying was likely a culmination of quite a bit of smaller problems.  Imagine being that person. Imagine how hard this is where your boss changes positions, says erratic things, and there’s a pretty good chance you’re going to get thrown under the bus for it. All the trauma of being a caregiver for a loved one with none of the empathy from anyone around you. . . just a judgment of how they might be able to exploit the situation. And if you’re not politically convenient; you’re gonna get thrown away like toilet paper.  Imagine how hard that is.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-08T09:33:07,8
"I comment on this further down the line.  This is not something that happens all at once. And “cover up” is a cudgel of a phrase that does not adequately encompass the lived experience of a long term, mental decline.   I also explain that your reaction is precisely what will happen to all of them. Young kids, basically, who got into politics to bust their ass and make a difference. . . and here they are, in the fucking firing line, 26 hours days for peanuts and living in hostels, now forced into a series of small impossible decisions.   They didn’t hide the stroke. And for all they knew, it was temporary and part of his legit diagnosis.   I think they deserve sympathy. Unless you’ve had the lived experience of a family member of close relative fall into the slow decline of dementia or the slow and steady alterations of personality as they slowly sundown over a couple of years, the hope is always that they become the person they were.  To suggest that it was a super easy set of choices for any of them to finally get to this point is to not care st all about the details.  Shit, I don’t know the details either. But I sure as hell don’t want to prejudge.  I give them love.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-08T18:53:41,11
