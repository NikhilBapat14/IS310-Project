"Yeah, about that.   >Separately, the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group “took a shot” at the Truman on Tuesday, four of the people said, despite President Donald Trump announcing an apparent ceasefire with the group hours earlier.       [https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/second-us-navy-jet-is-lost-at-sea](https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/politics/second-us-navy-jet-is-lost-at-sea)",CapnTugg,2025-05-06T22:04:47,6
Would be an interesting PR move for the White House to give DOGE credit for this cost savings. But I believe that would too close to calling the bombing wasteful for comfort for them...,invalidreddit,2025-05-06T21:45:08,3
Things are not matching up here. We've lost a second plane today from that same aircraft carrier just outside Yemen that lost one earlier this week.,pinetreesgreen,2025-05-06T22:23:48,2

"If we want to peotect American trade, we are bomving the wrong target.  No one has done more to disrupt American shipping than Trump.   It would take the Houthis ten thousand years at their current pace to match the damage Trump has done American trade in one hundred days.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-06T22:13:06,2

"Israel is trying to start a full take over of Gaza and was trying to arrange strikes agianst Iran behind trumps back. This is trumps team pushing back against the ongoing temper tantrum of Israel. We never saw this type of push back with the Biden admin. Its surreal that they lied to us every day about working towards a ceasefire. Because if they were, this is what they would have started doing. ",KidFromDudley,2025-05-07T00:28:43,0
"Trump is too scared to wage an actual war so he made a deal with terrorists.   Shockingly, it seems the terrorists already broke the truce.",falcobird14,2025-05-06T22:55:02,-1
"First sentence of the article:  >The United States and Houthis in Yemen reached a deal to halt American airstrikes against the group after the Iranian-backed militants agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea, President Trump and Omani mediators said Tuesday.  Allegedly they got a deal with the Houthis to stop attacking American ships.",Naurgul,2025-05-06T21:48:00,8
Because its probably too costly.  The U.S. lost 22 Reaper Drones which cost 30 Million each.  And they lost 3 F-18 Jets.  All while the Houthis have not been dismayed whatsoever.,BlackAfroUchiha,2025-05-07T18:27:43,1

Yes but I'm confused how that ever flew with Trump.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-06T21:53:28,3
"As long as he feels he ""got a deal done"" and ""won"". Here's what Trump said:  >“They just don’t want to fight,” Mr. Trump said. “And we will honor that and we will stop the bombings. They have capitulated, but more importantly, we will take their word. They say they will not be blowing up ships anymore.”",Naurgul,2025-05-06T21:58:10,7
In the signal chat last month the participants talked about their view the the bombings are chiefly of benefit to Europe to the detriment of the US.,Rahodees,2025-05-06T22:08:48,3
