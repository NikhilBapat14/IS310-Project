No definitely not. Having some arbitrary quota feels performative at best.   Absolutely there should be more diversity of thought in politics given the dominance of old white dudes but the solution is providing ways for more diversity to get into politics and encouraging more people to get into politics not trying to rigidly enforce some set number. Thats how you get turned into cannon fodder for republicans culture war propaganda,ninjadude93,2025-04-14T06:36:53,21
Quotas around race and gender are a bad idea but I would like to see tighter requirements for running for office. Too often a person who doesn't truly even live in an area is able to run and represent it.   That shouldn't be allowed. There should be rules in place that one must be an established resident of an area for a full decade prior to campaigning for office. Part of being an established resident should include employment in addition to primary residency.,8to24,2025-04-14T06:41:42,8
"I don’t support quotas of any kind for any job. In my personal life, I hire based on references, availability and cost. I’ve hired men and women as well as different races as long as they can speak English or Spanish. I will not hire someone I can’t communicate with.  It’s insane to have quotas.",baxterstate,2025-04-14T07:03:58,4
Proportional representation solves that problem. If you want to organize as the black party or the female party and you get 10% of the votes then your party should get 10% of the seats. Up to you then,MxOffcrRtrd,2025-04-14T07:04:50,3
"Gender or racial quotas of any kind is just sexism and racism. If someone gets a job based on their gender or skin color, and someone else loses out on a job based on their gender or skin color, then what's being done is sex based or race based discrimination.  If everyone has the same rights to run for office, and the decision is based on merit, anyone who wouldn't get the job without the quota, but would get it with the quota is in fact not qualified. If someone would actually be qualified, they could get the job no problem without any kind of quota.",FreedomPocket,2025-04-14T09:47:57,3
"Quotas can feel unfair in the short term, especially to qualified individuals who are passed over. But if the system itself has historically favored one group, then quotas are a way to level the playing field—not forever, but long enough to reset the balance. No one wants a surgeon or a pilot hired just to meet a quota, but politics is different—representation matters as much as competence. If half the population is women, but only 20% of leaders are, that’s not meritocracy, that’s a systemic issue. Quotas aren't perfect, but they may be the push needed to fix deeper problems.",Only_Economics7148,2025-04-15T01:37:38,3
"No, but I do support giving all groups a fair shake at showing they’re the most qualified candidate for the job.",Arkmer,2025-04-14T06:57:54,2
"Any quota's would simply be a form of racism. Hiring a individual based on gender or race is the dictionary definition of sexism/racism.   If you truly want equality, you need to figure out a way to run a campaign without a name, a gender or a race even being announced, basically a no name candidate with record of (insert resume here). The candidate runs on merit alone and it is a surprise at the end to see who the person is and what they looks like.  That would eliminate  1. All bad ""isms"" (racism, sexism, etc.)  2. Media bashing and misinformation  3. All ""I am famous"" factors  Hell, have fun with it, run it like the masked singer, LMAO.",Balanced_Outlook,2025-04-14T10:47:18,1
"I do not support it.   Politicians are elected by the people, and though some or many be prejudiced, they have that right to weigh that in their selection of candidate choice.",neosituation_unknown,2025-04-14T15:39:49,1
"Every country on the globe is in competition with every other country. Over the long haul, anything other than objective criteria will put that country in a competitive disadvantage.  Speaking from the USA point of view, The USA is already at a disadvantage against China and India because more people in India and China speak English than vice versa.  Hell, Americans have trouble with Spanish, an easy language to learn.",baxterstate,2025-04-14T16:19:38,1
I support encouragement (conceptual & principle) in place of enforcement (quotas). As the latter usually only results as a weapon of unfair discrimination.,Sublimotion,2025-04-14T20:41:45,1
"Quotas have been proven to work in Australia. The two left of centre parties, Labor and the Greens both have gender parity quotas and they're both sitting at 52% and 53% respectively of their federally elected members being women. The two main right wing parties who refuse to have quotas, the Liberals and Nationals (in a permanent coalition with each other) are both sitting at 29% women in their parties. As a specific result of this, last election the Liberals lost almost all of their inner city electorates to Independent candidates who are all women.     The quotas flat out worked and the numbers proved it.",rigormorty,2025-04-18T00:03:44,1
"The problem with racial and gender quotas is that they don't address the underlying problem creating disparity of inclusion.   In the 1950's, the US Supreme Court moved to end segregation in American schools. Yet today, American public schools are still largely segregated. All of the laws passed and programs funded to end segregation, ignored the simple fact that financial success and generational wealth were as much a factor in school segregation as racial animus.   In the 1990's, the main Post Office in downtown San Francisco had a staff that was 80% black (African American). Under the Affirmative Action laws of the time, a number of lawsuits were filed. None of them were successful, because the the investigations showed that 80% of the people applying to work at that post office were black. The staffing there accurately represented the pool of applicants applying, and Affirmative Action quotas could not be applied, without disadvantaging the people those quotas were meant to help.   And this why DEI programs are a much smarter and more measured way of working towards inclusion, in a manner that would best reflect the needs of a healthy society. A DEI program at that Post Office would have asked the question ""In a racially diverse city, why are 80% of our applicants from the black community?"" It is possible there was a racial bias in effect, but it is also possible a bunch of other factors (like the racial balance of the community living closest to the Post Office, etc.) could have been the cause.   Quotas can be used as a temporary stop-gap measure to work towards inclusion, but in the long run they lack subtlety and nuance, and are inherently unfair to the people being affected, both the people they advantage and the people they disadvantage, and not always in obvious ways.",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-14T12:41:46,0
"Since we have two senators per state in the US Senate, I would not be opposed to a quota that demands one be a woman and one be a man. I think it would be extremely controversial in the US as a whole though, and any race-based quota would be even more so. I know a lot of countries with ethnic minorities mandate that a certain amount of seats in the legislature go to these minorities, but I don't think that would ever fly in the US and would also be a bit hard to implement due to the localization of elections here.  I think the Democratic Party does prioritize diversity (at times though in a way that puts diversity above candidate quality unfortunately) but the Republican Party does not at all, and it'd honestly serve the party a lot to start. The Conservative Party in the UK made a lot of efforts in the 2000s to promote more women and non-white people to stand for election to parliament, and now all three women PMs have been Conservative, the first non-white PM has been Conservative, and the party is being led by a right-wing black woman, whereas Labour has not been led by anyone who isn't a white man. It's just very interesting to see as a American given the state of American politics.  I feel like the Republicans would have much higher ground to stand on when arguing their culture war positions if they weren't overwhelmingly white and mainly male. Plus many black Americans are culturally conservative and the party could maybe make even more inroads in that community if they shed their ""we're racist"" image. If the Republicans got a decent portion of black voters, the Democrats would be in a lot of trouble.",lionhearted318,2025-04-14T07:00:34,-3
"I mean, this would basically eliminate the usefulness of this culture war argument because it would apply to republicans too. Not sure I’m on board with the idea, and I’m definitely not on board for elected positions, but defusing the partisan valence of the “affirmative action” talking point is an argument *in favor* of this sort of rule.",Polyodontus,2025-04-14T06:44:56,1
"It amazes me when carpetbaggers win local elections. My primary criteria for any local representative is you love our town/county/state. Out of all the places to live, you voluntarily chose to live here before you even thought about running for office.   We had Oz and then McCormick in PA who both were shopping for a place they thought they could win. A couple of rich guys who would never chose to live here if not for a shot at power. That should have been instantly disqualifying for every voter.",che-che-chester,2025-04-14T15:32:47,2
"If the voters are concerned about someone not being in the district, they can vote for someone else.
