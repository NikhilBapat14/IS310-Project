Why hasn't Hegseth also been fired? Is there a limit on the number of incompetent hires Trump can let go in a day?,AllynCrane,2025-05-01T13:34:57,1
Damn. Wonder who will play him in the Snl skit. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-01T13:34:07,1
Can't wait for him to send chat invites to North Korea and Iran instead of a reporter.,jwferguson,2025-05-01T13:36:57,1
I hate reading these hopeful headlines that act like a normal reaction is worthy of expecting.,2ndprize,2025-05-01T13:42:28,1
Technically he’s a leaker. He should be Bondi’s first case under her campaign against whistleblowers.,NorCal_commie,2025-05-01T13:53:14,1

"The lot of mid rich white men:  You fuck up, the only way to deal with it is give them a promotion or else they'd have to admit the people who hired them fucked up.",Federal_Drummer7105,2025-05-01T14:00:30,1
"That's right! It wasn;t a firing or a resignation, just an unrelated personnel adjustment.   The next one will be worse than Waltz, and I bet a dozen dems confirm them.",anemone_within,2025-05-01T14:19:30,1
"Trump loved to fire people his first term, and there’s no lack of sycophants to replace them. I’m kinda curious why he’s barely fired anyone this time. Too busy firing middle class civil servants, I guess.",snarky_marmot,2025-05-01T13:46:24,1

"If you see his cabinet meetings it's easy to understand why. Instead of talking about policy, the Cabinet members praise him like it's North Korea.",TranquilSeaOtter,2025-05-01T13:50:55,1
