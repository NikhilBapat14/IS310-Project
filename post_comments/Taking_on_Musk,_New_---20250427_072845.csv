I don’t totally disagree with this but how will the state reconcile pulling the service and support rug from under hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicle owners?  Tesla does not make their service details public (not even vehicle alignment) and pushing them further out will hurt a lot of consumers - many of which purchased these cars many years ago and helped bring about adoption in electric vehicles in NYS.  ,fujidust,2025-04-27T07:51:14,14

Better to get large investors to sell all their stock. Tanking the Tesla company itself is a roundabout way as the stock doesn’t follow the company performance that well.   As long as the share price is high it doesn’t matter to him or the board how bad it gets at the company.  He also has a bunch of other companies that contribute to his extreme wealth.  It’s his combined extreme wealth that makes him problematic as he is purchasing power.

"I agree with you on the Tesla part. Dealers are a cancer to us all and if we had direct to customer sales, cars would be cheaper on average. The dealers are the reason the average car transaction is almost $50k now. I went to my local Toyota dealer just to browse cars for my nana because she wants to replace her 2004 Highlander with over 300k miles. This dealer had 2025 Highlanders on the lot with $10k markups. So I went to look at RAV4s because it’s a RAV4, it’s supposed to cheap and reliable. Well cheap it was not. A BASE RAV4 had a sticker price $5k more than MSRP for absolutely no reason. It’s madness lol  She’s keeping her Highlander",Kavani18,2025-04-27T14:46:52,1
"My dude if you think any car is worth an additional 30k markup I have a bridge to sell you. If demand is that high for 3 series I would order the m3, place deposit, and then buy a cheaper 3 series I’d trade back at or just below purchase when the other car arrives.   That seems crazy to me also but it’s still less than $30k.",fache,2025-04-27T12:47:14,2

"Makes sense, thank you for sharing and clarifying. Sounds like there should be a process to review on some timetable if those EV protections, which the one you cited seems to resemble the infant industry argument for trade, still hold water as the industry/company grows.

"Yeah, I just dunno if direct actually ends up fixing it, because it is such an inventory centric industry. You'd either have to order months out always, or you are still going to have inventory sitting _somewhere_ which will drive sales tactics. Also you need some ability/ place to do things like test drives and such.   The above sticker also is the same thing as Ticketmaster -- it's not without reason, the reason is people pay for it. it's the other side of the supply/demand curve that causes below MSRP cars.   In general across all things we (America) do put up with way too much predatory sales / capitalism. Personally it's gotten to the point where I don't really like engaging with purchasing  _anything_ as I _always_ assume that vendors are trying to screw me now. But I'm at least doing capitalism right and responding by buying less shit",the8bit,2025-04-27T15:13:08,1
"Well with all the paperwork and depreciation you'd likely lose 5-10k on a 3 series doing that.   I waited for mine but many people are willing to pay for the extra months, really depends on how you value things it's not tremendously insane. Certainly no worse paying 20k over MSRP for something you can sell at MSRP a year later vs paying MSRP and losing 20k in depreciation over the first year. Same net result just one is more normalized :shrug;",the8bit,2025-04-27T13:14:25,3

"But they’re not banning those sales. Those are already banned. If people want a different law, they can change it. This is just making Tesla play by the rules instead of giving it a special privilege. Fix it long term - take the time to do it right, figure out the goals of the policy, the costs and the success metrics, and you’re good to go.   Elmo got special treatment because it was felt that the environmental benefits outweighed any negative impacts of going around the law. His change of direction has eliminated that argument, period.   It’s like if you give an athlete a full ride football scholarship, then he turns into a schlub, gains 400 lbs, and can no longer leave his dorm room. It’s fair that he lose his scholarship. We might additionally think that colleges should be tuition free for all students, but that will take some planning. It certainly doesn’t mean that the schlub should keep his scholarship in the meantime.",LimbaughsLumpyLungs,2025-04-28T16:05:54,1

If you bought your car AFTER 2020 you knew exactly the type of man Elon Musk was so I don’t feel pity. You bought the car KNOWING you were handing your money to a dude who was supporting far right ventures and conspiracies.   Once again, stop trying to discredit the assistance towards Facism by saying you didn’t know any better if the car was bought any time after 2020.  Never said go after peoples cars, never said anything of the like (though fuck yeah destroy Cybertrucks, those are the only time I will make an exception)   Don’t make assumptions of people you know absolutely nothing about.

"Whose fault is that? The consumer? Or the man using the company as a tool of his own wealth and spreading ideologies that are obviously unpopular? Because the value of Teslas have been going down since he started spreading his hateful bullshit, not since they started getting burned down (again, not okay….unless it’s a CyberTruck)  I will admit it’s not the consumers fault that it’s happened, but the consumer has seen it coming for years in advance.  The other guy that replied to me? He was looking to buy a new one TWO YEARS AGO. We were well into Elons bullshit at this point but it didn’t matter to him.  I am absolutely for amnesty for people who got caught before he took off the mask. They did not know any better (though the Thailand incident should have been peoples wake up call, but I digress).

Now, as I actually said in this thread, trade/sell the car to who?  You people, and I’m 100% sure that includes you specifically, are targeting the cars and the innocent people who own those cars; so why would anyone accept such a trade or buy the car when you crazies are threatening that?

If you bought a Tesla before his mask came off I absolutely and utterly will give amnesty because you got caught with your pants down, you quite literally didn’t know the man you were dealing with. But if you bought a Tesla after Elon Musk slide into being a hateful and facist person, you don’t deserve sympathy and I’m not looking to try and find it.  Why is that so hard to accept? Oh right, because you were actively purchasing his cars after he became a madman.  Once again, I don’t act on assumptions, I act on evidence. The evidence shows you were looking to buy a Tesla after the mask came off, trying to put money in the mans pockets. You almost had my sympathy because I thought you were someone looking to get out of dealing with the monster. But you don’t actually want to, you are cool with him as long as he doesn’t hurt the value of your car.

The issue is you go after the person who is being the shithead, not innocent people who in any other circumstance would be an ally.  But you go off Queen and make an enemy from an ally… it’s a great strategy to win.  Edit: in case you forgot or are too young to know, Tesla single-handedly kicked off EV ownership in this country and around the world.  This is not debatable.
