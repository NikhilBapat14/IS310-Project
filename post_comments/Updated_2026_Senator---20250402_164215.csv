"The 2026 map is pretty red, so GOP normally wouldn’t be too worried. But Trump just decided to torpedo the economy through tariffs and gutting most federal programs. While MAGA and average GOP voters cheer now, it could be a very different story by fall of 2026 when impacts of Trump’s actions are going to be felt.",Background-War9535,2025-04-03T05:38:07,44
"D's have a pickup opportunity in Maine, and maybe North Carolina. Everywhere else is a stretch. GOP majority will probably be maintained. Senate elections are like the Electoral College these days -- it doesn't really matter how well or poorly the party does, most of the states will hold the line.   Some think the tariffs will cause a deep recession. If Trump doesn't change his mind for the ten millionth time and pull them back, then it will. But in our hyper-polarized times, I don't know if a recession is enough to make people betray the party that they've now made an integral part of their identity. It really depends on how well they can rationalize that it's somehow the opposition's fault.",TheOvy,2025-04-03T16:48:10,13

"Whenever Trump does something bad it takes a few days for conservatives to get on board with it, to distribute the right language to reframe it as something that isn't Trump's fault.  I wouldn't expect these first few days of seemingly rational thought from conservatives to be predictive of votes in 2026.   I also think there's a very good chance Republicans will manage to frame this as Democrats hurting the country. I think they may use arguments like this:  * Trump is trying to save American manufacturing jobs, and Democrats are cheering for a collapse * The tariffs aren't working because other countries are waiting out the election and believe Democrats will repeal them * Republicans are geniuses and the economy is *still bad*, can you imagine how much worse if a Democrat who is and idiot **hates America** were in charge?!  I'm just curious if more abstract arguments or emotional appeals will win out over what I assume will be people's lived experience. I feel like re-electing Trump either means we have a goldfish memory or collective delusion. I don't have high hopes.",PinchesTheCrab,2025-04-03T10:12:54,7

"The map is very GOP friendly. I think Dems will be able to hold most of the swing seats they have like Michigan and New Hampshire, but Georgia could flip to the Republicans depending on who the GOP nominates. If Brian Kemp runs, there’s a good chance he wins.  I don’t really see many opportunities for the Democrats to pick up new seats. There will probably be chatter over Texas and Florida but I highly doubt that is happening anytime soon, and that’d leave Maine and North Carolina as the only real opportunities.   With Susan Collins running again, she’ll surely have a leg up with her name recognition and moderate credentials, plus there is no widespread anger directed towards her now like there was when she was running in 2020, and she still won that by a large margin.  North Carolina is maybe the *best* chance of a Democrat pickup but I don’t think it’ll happen. Thom Tillis has become a bit of a moderate in the past few years (maybe just to save his seat tbh), but NC is always kind of a state that Dems think they can win and then it never happens outside of gubernatorial races. So I have doubts here too.  I wouldn’t even include Iowa or Ohio in the potential discussion.",lionhearted318,2025-04-03T05:55:07,7
"Ranked from most to least winnable possible pickup opportunities.   1. North Carolina: As long as Cooper runs, I would be surprised if Democrats do not pick up the seat. Tillis is hated by both MAGA and non-MAGA crowd, and the State moved leftward even in a Red Wave 2024 year. In a disastrous Trump midterm, it should be an easy win.  Matchup: Roy Cooper (D) vs Thom Tillis (R) Prediction: Roy Cooper (D) Win (75% probability)   2. Maine: Susan Collins has never been weaker. She has lost the support of centrist Dems, and MAGA hates her. Only issue, no one really wants to run against her. Golden or Mills would easily sweep the floor with her, but they are not interested in alienating her. Jackson also is looking at a Governor run. I think Mills might still do it, and win handily.  Matchup: Janet Mills (D) vs Susan Collins (R) Prediction: Janet Mills (D) Win (65% probability)   3. Ohio: After that, it starts to become really hard for Democrats to have any pickup opportunities. Dems have two excellent candidates for Ohio: Brown and Ryan, but Husted is a pretty popular candidate, despite his controversies. I'm hoping the Trump presidency would lower his support, but not really hopeful of that.  Matchup: Sherrod Brown (D) vs Jon Husted (R) Prediction: Sherrod Brown (D) Win (51% probability)   4. Texas: I can't believe I'm saying this, but as unlikely as it is, for the first time ever, flipping a Texas seat is not impossible. Cornyn is in a tough spot with the primary challenge from Paxton, and Allred is by far the best candidate Dems have put through there in decades. It's not very likely, but who knows?  Matchup: Colin Allred (D) vs John Cornyn (R) Prediction: John Cornyn (R) Win (70% probability)    5. Alaska: Honestly, there are no other pickup opportunities, other than major upsets, I doubt it can be flipped. Sullivan is well liked, and only Peltola has a chance, if she even wants to run in the first place.  Matchup: Marie Peltola (D) vs Dan Sullivan (R) Prediction: Dan Sullivan (R) Win (70% probability)   6. Nebraska: Now we are just daydreaming. No way on earth Nebraska elects a Democrat, or even an independent with ties to the Dems. But if anyone can do it, it's Osborn. Rickets is a meh candidate, but it's Nebraska.  Matchup: Dan Osborn (I/D) vs Pete Rickets (R) Prediction: Pete Rickets (R) Win (75% probability)",Lethargic_Logician,2025-04-04T14:54:42,3
"Every Senate map is incredibly friendly at the moment. Democrats baseline numbers are something like 40-45 seats where they actively can compete in.  Which means that they need extraordinary times and effort to win in the many states where they 10-20% underdogs or worse. And that may not even take them to 50%.  The generic ballot is currently around Democrats +1, which is far below where they need for even a slight majority (+5 to +8). Currently, that means they lose seats even though the GOP is defending a bunch of seats, simply because the left have lost that much ground from 2020.  To put it bluntly, because things are so colosally fucked for the Democrats, they are at risk of losing the seats currently held by Ossoff, Peters, Smith, and Shaheen and only have mild shots at picking up the seats held by Collins and Tillis.   Or in other words, if they do great they'd have 49 seats. If they fall short, they'll have as few as 43.  This is because they have simply become uncompetitive in too many states. This is not a 'good map for the GOP', they are defending more seats. It is a bad country for the DNC. You can't draw a map that is good for them because they just don't have positive momentum in enough states.",ManBearScientist,2025-04-03T08:30:53,6
"It is far too early to even bother with this.  Everything will come down to the economy.  If nothing with the tariff insanity changes over the next year and we're in some serious economic recession or even depression, the GOP gets its ass kicked across the board.   The election would look like 1974- right after Watergate.  The Democrats added 45 seats to their majority in the House and four Senate seats their majority there.   If these tariffs go away, if the current Congress finally finds some balls to check Trump's power; or if Trump drops dead and we have Vance, that changes things.   Then I think the House still goes to the Democrats, and the Senate could do anything- from staying as is (53-47 R) to Democratic control- 51-49... (only if there is massive Dem turnout)",NYC3962,2025-04-04T06:04:28,2
"I think the Dems will take back the Senate, possibly by a convincing margin. We are on track for a massive recession, and the vast majority of voters vote on economic vibes. The last time a Republican crashed the economy with tariffs, we got four terms of FDR, the New Deal, and 60 years of Democratic control in Congress.   In 2018, Trump hadn't even done nearly as much as and the national environment was D+8. Keeping in mind 2024 was R+1.5, the recent 10-15 point swings in Wisconsin and Florida, and that the economy was doing alright in 2018, and I think we might see a swing in excess of 10 points. That would put states like Alaska and Ohio as extremely winnable, and make states like South Carolina, Kansas, Florida, and Montana in play. Hell, Nebraska could be a tight race if Dan Osborn runs again; he only lost by 7 points last time. Even a 2018-style environment would tilt it towards him.  Also, it is important to keep in mind that Democrats have the highest propensity voters these days, not that their base has switched to be more educated and plugged in to politics. The MAGA base often only turns out for Trump himself; this can be seen in the number of 2024 voters who voted for Trump but left the rest of their ballot blank, leading to relatively mild Democratic losses in the Senate and a nearly split House.",MemeStarNation,2025-04-05T12:57:59,2

"Roy Cooper will definitely win. Then again someone like Wiley Nickel or Jeff Jackson might run instead (they would probably both lose). I think Susan Collins will easily win. She was expected to lose by a 5 point margin to Sarah Gideon and was down in almost every poll. She won anyway. A lot of people in Maine will say they don’t like her but also think privately that she has accomplished a lot. I think Cornyn will probably lose a primary to Paxton. It will probably be close (especially if Trump endorse cornyn) but I see Paxton coming out on top. The general election will probably be close but I see Paxton winning by a 52-48 or 53-47 margin. Absent Mathew McConaughey, I don’t see even the most popular democratic politician in Texas winning. The Alaska race won’t even be close unless Peltola runs for Senate. I don’t think she will though because she wants to run for Governor.",tegg23,2025-04-04T20:58:12,1

"I voted for Fetterman and donated to his campaign. He was mayor of the town next to mine for a super long time and he and his wife did great things there. It was a really dangerous and rundown area and still kind of is, but it’s not anywhere near as bad as it was before them. He was then a passable Lieutenant Governor. I voted for him to do for the country what he did for Braddock. I HOPE someone good primaries his ass. I wish his wife would psychologically ruin him because the entire reason she ended up married to him was because she reached out to him, having been interested in his politics and wanting to work with him. I’m not sure that Casey will come back and go up against Fetterman. Fetterman, despite how he’s been voting right now, supported Casey’s re-election campaign and showed up for him many times. They are friends. I don’t think Shapiro will run for senate. He’s up for his second term in 26, and I think he has bigger goals than a senator. He has been very vocal about his lawsuits against the Trump administration the last two months, and I think plans to use his record of protecting Pennsylvania from the worst policies as momentum for a presidential bid. He would have to give up half his second term as governor to run for either, and it’s not worth it to do that for a senate seat. He is also friends with Fetterman. He worked as Attorney General under Fetterman as Lieutenant Governor, and he was able to run as Governor *because* Fetterman got out of the way and ran for senate instead. It would be nice if Fetterman retired and his wife would run in his place. It would be the most graceful way for him to disappear. It would be similar to Mark Kelly running after someone attempted to assassinate his politician wife. And I would still trust Gisele. She is a founder of several local non-profits, is an activist, and was covered under DACA as a child. She’s written to Congress asking them to address immigration humanely and not separate families. She’s GOT to be so pissed at her husband behind the scenes. I know he’s talked about the changes being a result of his stroke. I can’t imagine how she feels, but if I were in her position and my husband changed his views overnight, particularly ones that have firsthand impacted me during my most formative years….. I don’t know how long I would be able to just sit there hoping that the medical field could undo what the stroke did to his brain so I could have my pre-stroke husband back. It’s a really sad situation, but political views are 100% a very valid make or break in a relationship, and generally people who feel very strongly about their political views are the ones that it really matters for.    TLDR: I have a lot of feelings about the Fetterman comment because I watched him and his wife do so much good for the town neighboring mine. I don’t think Casey or Shapiro will primary him, but hope somebody will. If he wants to go out gracefully, he should retire and have his wife campaign for his seat because she didn’t stroke out and lose her progressive values.",CremePsychological77,2025-04-03T09:30:59,0

"Fetterman also voted in favor of the Laken Riley Act, which I feel like is a total slap in the face to his wife, who was covered under DACA as a child, and has written to Congress begging them to handle immigration humanely and not separate families. Fetterman said he would never vote in favor of something like the Laken Riley Act *because* of his wife, and then he did. I can’t imagine how hurt she must feel that he did that. Immigration policy has to cut to the core of her very being. She grew up here, undocumented, and her husband is voting in favor of legislation that would mean someone could accuse her of stealing a candy bar and now she’s locked up without due process with ICE. Someone could accuse her dad, his father-in-law, of made up SA, and now he’s arrested, given no due process, and taken to an ICE prison cell. Fetterman’s own children are half Brazilian. I’m not sure how white passing they are, but kids are getting snatched up too. ICE just snagged a little girl in Boston when she was going to school the other day, and maybe a month or so ago, they sent secret service agents to an elementary school in Chicago trying to get a child because he made an anti-Trump video on TikTok or Instagram or something. This is straight up Gestapo shit, and Fetterman voted in favor of it. It’s just like the American South used to be, before the Civil Rights Era. A white woman accuses a black man of looking at her the wrong way, and he gets “punished” — no court date, no burden of proof, no defense attorney, nothing. It’s indefensible that he voted in favor of that imo, especially considering his intimate connection to people who may be harmed by the same law.",CremePsychological77,2025-04-03T09:51:35,4

"You’re putting way too much emphasis on identity. Beto and Biden both got these good margins because the conditions were favorable to Democrats in the years of their elections. 2018 was Trump’s first midterm year and 2020 was the year where Trump lost a bunch of swing states due to opposition to his covid policies, and they all swung back in 2024 once conditions changed.  Beto ran for governor in 2022 during conditions that were far less favorable to Democrats and he was destroyed, so clearly this is not about him being a particularly good candidate. 2026 will probably be pretty good conditions for Democrats given it’s another Trump midterm but I don’t think there’s anything to suggest Texas is winnable given what others have said about Latinos drifting rightward, nor is there anything to suggest Beto or another white guy would make a better candidate.",lionhearted318,2025-04-03T09:17:43,3

The main point is Dems need to get out of this “this race is not winnable” mindset. Arnold Schwarzenegger won California. Laura Kelly won Kansas. Florida just went D+18.

"One of the biggest mistakes people make when looking at elections is trying to apply localized outcomes nationally.  Schwarzenegger won California in a recall election over 20 years ago to replace a highly unpopular incumbent due to the California energy crisis. He was a movie star who was well-connected in the Hollywood elite and a household name for all Americans, plus a moderate Republican who did not alienate Hollywood liberals. But once again, you cannot use a 20 year old election to make points about today. California was not as solidly blue in 2003 as it is now, and a Republican won by a 15-point margin in the state just 9 years prior to Schwarzenegger's election.  Kelly also only won in Kansas because of the immense unpopularity of her Republican opponent. Kris Kobach is a psycho who alienated far too much of the Kansas Republican Party, to the point where numerous Republicans in the state refused to endorse him and supported Kelly instead. With that being said, her first term win also came in a Trump midterm year with favorable conditions for Democrats, and with only about a 5-point margin with a moderate independent candidate at 6% who likely siphoned off votes from the GOP. She was reelected by just a 2-point margin due to incumbency advantage and good approval ratings (about +14 in 2022).  Special elections have proven to us last year that they do not always predict actual conditions. Democrats overperformed in nearly every special election during the Biden presidency but then we all know how 2024 went. This is likely due to low voter turnout in special elections, and the demographics that are more likely to vote in them (highly-educated, politically involved people) are demographics that are more likely to vote Democrat.  So no, I do not think you can apply any of these results to the 2026 elections and presume that we will get a repeat scenario. Analyze every election as an individual election with its own circumstances. Once we see who the candidates are we can get a much better sense of what will happen, and 2026 likely will have favorable conditions for Democrats, but most races that seem unwinnable *probably* *are* unwinnable without extreme circumstances going on in the state or in regards to the candidates.  Not to mention, state elections are far more fluid than federal elections are. We see a lot more states voting against their typical partisan lean in gubernatorial elections than we do in senatorial and presidential elections. Two of the examples you cited were both gubernatorial elections, we do not see many blue states electing GOP senators or red states electing Dem senators anymore. The best recent example would be Doug Jones winning Alabama, but this was because the GOP literally nominated a child molester as their candidate. Absent extreme circumstances like that, I do not see any reason to predict such a radical shift in the 2026 senatorial elections as of today.",lionhearted318,2025-04-03T10:11:42,2

"The main point is we need to organize and focus on every election instead of counting any one election out. That was the biggest mistake in the last 10 years.

One thing that democrats have become really good at is fundraising. They are not “running out of money”. Howard dean started the 50 state strategy and then the last 4 DNC leaders got away from that and focused more on fundraising instead. The whole platform Ken Martin ran on and was elected (by state parties rebuking national leader endorsement) was on bringing democrats back to the 50 state strategy rebuild state parties  I don’t think you could make the argument that democrats today are better off not doing a 50 state strategy compared to democrats in 2004,blu13god,2025-04-03T11:08:49,1
"The problem at this point is less money and more decent candidates, especially in red states—there is a very real possibility that Stacey Abrams winds up running for governor in Georgia for the third time in a row in 2026 when Kemp leaves office simply because she has the most name recognition.     The other possible contenders are Jen Jordan (lost the state AG race by 5.5 points to one of the R frontrunners for governor), Jason Carter (last ran in 2014 and lost by 7 points to the incumbent), Lucy McBath (a nonstarter due to her position on gun control) and Keisha Lance Bottoms (former mayor of Atlanta who was forced to forgo reelection in the aftermath of her poor handling of the Rayshard Brooks shooting).     That’s inexcusable in a state like Georgia, especially with one of the two Republican frontrunners being a fake elector and the other having willingly defended the heartbeat abortion ban among other things.     You’ll find similar stories across the south as well as out west in the traditionally Republican states (ID, WY, ND, SD, OK, etc.) A party cannot reliably win nationally or on a state basis when there is no bench even if they have unlimited funding.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-04T00:52:42,2
"In my opinion, I feel as if Democrats have completely lost their ability to message properly in that time period. We haven’t really run a charismatic candidate since Obama in my opinion. Republicans banked on the email controversy for Clinton and narrowly won as a result, and banked on the inflation crisis and immigration in 2024 to narrowly win. Democrats aren’t very good at responding appropriately in times of crisis, not at least since Obama ran in 2008, who was a charismatic politician who motivated voters and was good at messaging albeit the financial situation also benefitted the party. Biden won off of Obama nostalgia, he wasn’t in his prime anymore though, and opposition to Trump generated from a variety of factors. Democrats haven’t been able to effectively formulate a solid policy platform, appearing to flip flop on several issues and it alienates large groups of voters, combine that with independents who need to be convinced and our mistreatment of third party candidates only further sent potential support away from us in 2024. I think we have a solid chance based off the whole anti-Trump, anti-Elite platform but if we pull it off, we will need to work to reestablish our ground for 2028 and beyond.",XxCaptainJayxX1,2025-05-05T19:59:23,2
