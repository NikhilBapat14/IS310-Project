"Yeah...  if Johnson and congress could get some of their stuff done, that would be great.",SleekFilet,2025-04-28T09:11:02,191
The problem is that almost all of it can just be undone if dems take back the presidency,SecretConservAccount,2025-04-28T10:14:20,64
"Yea it'd be nice if congress can get it together too, literally all of these executive orders will be gone on day 1 on January 20th, 2029 if a Democrat wins the next election.",Rare_Cobalt,2025-04-28T13:02:58,11
"Yeah, no thanks to BLM Johnson.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-28T15:10:54,-3
"More flooding the zone. Needs to be Hurricane levels of flooding. Daily executive orders, set the auto-pen on auto-pilot.",thinkingisthehardest,2025-04-28T20:45:58,-1
"Trumps back is probably killing him after carrying this terrible congress. Really the headline should read “congressional laziness and apathy moves president to action” of course when congress literally does nothing, the other branches of government have to pick up the slack. We see the same with the judicial. If congress just passed laws dealing with immigration, then activist judges couldn’t do shit. Instead the congress, which by the way is supposed to be the branch that MAKES LAWS AND IS THE PRIMARY WAY FOR REGULAR PEOPLE TO INTERACT WITH GOVERNMENT does nothing. What a disgrace these guys are, no wonder people are open to a Trump 3rd term, what’s the alternative? Sitting and watching our congress people literally die of old age in office while they achieve nothing?",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-28T11:14:35,-22
None of what Trump has done will matter if Congress won't get off their asses.,pdawg43,2025-04-28T09:27:28,78

"Except it would be very unpopular to undo things like the ban of men from women's sports, affirming that gender is binary, and securing the border among many other things.     If nothing else, Trump put the nail in the coffin of gender ideology and woke.",Leftrighturn,2025-04-28T22:55:19,-6
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the plan with much of the Never Trump crowd. Try and wait out the clock as much as they can and keep Congress stagnant except where they have no control and must take a vote.,ITrCool,2025-04-28T13:09:14,5
I’m 75% sure they’d remove the sports ban and 100% sure they’d say gender is not binary and remove some of the border security.,SecretConservAccount,2025-04-28T23:04:53,7
