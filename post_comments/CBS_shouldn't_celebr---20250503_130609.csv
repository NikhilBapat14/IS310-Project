Lol. Just shows how much integrity the Emmys have as well.,RandolphE6,2025-05-03T13:27:45,25
Gob smacking idiocy. I can hardly believe this is real.,Blarghnog,2025-05-03T13:42:24,13
Are you talking about the interview that they swore was unedited? ðŸ˜Š You canâ€™t even make this shit up.,melie776,2025-05-03T14:20:32,11
"I am kinda wondering if this Emmy nomination was actually on purpose. They knew they would get a ton of flak, but now they can say that it was supposed to be edited all along.",Nectarine-Fast,2025-05-03T14:31:35,5
"The modern age is stuck in a validation death spiral - anyone saying *""I don't think this is such a good idea""* will be silenced/purged while anyone cheering for the team gets rewarded/promoted every step of the way.  Aside from giving us the cartoonish insanity we see in politics today, it also leaks out into regular parts of life. It's the crazy lady fighting the police like it's her heroic last stand, the old western movie brawl out of nowhere *happening anywhere,* the random nobody with a god complex creating a public disturbance because he's high on his own fumes.  All of these people had the internet validating their brains out before they went on their grand spirit journeys.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-03T13:17:38,4
Kind of the same with the Pulitzer. They gave them away for the Russia Collusion Hoax stories.,Leroyf1969,2025-05-03T18:15:45,7
"And the Nobel Peace Prize, which they gave to Obama for being black. Well, half-black.",Strange_Chemistry503,2025-05-04T06:40:26,4
