I am just glad that they are not acting like this is all the tariffs and has nothing to do with Donald Trump openly threatening to destroy Canada so he can Annex it.  The tariffs are bad but compared to that they are next to God damn nothing.,Deinosoar,2025-05-05T09:04:33,99
"Canada and the US have maintained win-win relationship for decades, with a few minor bumps in the road we've mostly paved over in the past. Now America has a president that has no interest in win-win relationships. Trump's philosophy is a zero sum game where there must be winners and losers.  The best summation of Trump's style I've seen comes from negotiation lawyer and teacher David Honig:  “I’m going to get a little wonky and write about Donald Trump and negotiations. For those who don’t know, I’m an adjunct professor at Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law and I teach negotiations.  Okay, here goes.  Trump, as most of us know, is the credited author of “The Art of the Deal,” a book that was actually ghost written by a man named Tony Schwartz, who was given access to Trump and wrote based upon his observations. If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call “distributive bargaining.”  Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for the construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.  The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it, not a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.  The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked. Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.  One of the risks of distributive bargaining is bad will. In a one-time distributive bargain, e.g. negotiating with the cabinet maker in your casino about whether you’re going to pay his whole bill or demand a discount, you don’t have to worry about your ongoing credibility or the next deal. If you do that to the cabinet maker, you can bet he won’t agree to do the cabinets in your next casino, and you’re going to have to find another cabinet maker.  So when you approach international negotiation, in a world as complex as ours, with integrated economies and multiple buyers and sellers, you simply must approach them through integrative bargaining. If you attempt distributive bargaining, success is impossible. And we see that already.  Trump has raised tariffs on China. China responded, in addition to raising tariffs on US goods, by dropping all its soybean orders from the US and buying them from Russia. The effect is not only to cause tremendous harm to US farmers, but also to increase Russian revenue, making Russia less susceptible to sanctions and boycotts, increasing its economic and political power in the world, and reducing ours. Trump saw steel and aluminum and thought it would be an easy win, BECAUSE HE SAW ONLY STEEL AND ALUMINUM - HE SEES EVERY NEGOTIATION AS DISTRIBUTIVE. China saw it as integrative, and integrated Russia and its soybean purchase orders into a far more complex negotiation ecosystem.  Trump has the same weakness politically. For every winner there must be a loser. And that’s just not how politics works, not over the long run.  For people who study negotiations, this is incredibly basic stuff, negotiations 101, definitions you learn before you even start talking about styles and tactics. And here’s another huge problem for us.  Trump is utterly convinced that his experience in a closely held real estate company has prepared him to run a nation, and therefore he rejects the advice of people who spent entire careers studying the nuances of international negotiations and diplomacy. But the leaders on the other side of the table have not eschewed expertise, they have embraced it. And that means they look at Trump and, given his very limited tool chest and his blindly distributive understanding of negotiation, they know exactly what he is going to do and exactly how to respond to it.  From a professional negotiation point of view, Trump isn’t even bringing checkers to a chess match. He’s bringing a quarter that he insists on flipping for heads or tails, while everybody else is studying the chess board to decide whether its better to open with Najdorf or Grünfeld.”  — David Honig  [Source](https://www.cmpartners.com/negotiation/the-importance-of-value-creation/)",biscuitarse,2025-05-05T09:26:09,100

"Trump looks at the trade deficit between us in Canada as ""getting ripped off"". The actual numbers are not clear because of e-services but around 420 billion exported from Canada and approx 350 billion imported by Canada leaving about 70 billion deficit and not the 200-400 billion+ depending on the day of the week Trump claims. Also the numbers don't tel the whole truth. The crude oil imported by the US from Canada are heavily discounted and are piped directing into US refineries that employs millions of jobs... that alone is a huge boom to both countries. Cheap, reliable oil shipped at low cost from a friendly nation. All of these resources by mere fact they can be shipped at low cost to the US are an added benefit that Trump just doesn't put into economic reality.  In short we need to get back to working with each other. The world is already in chaos and we need to stick together as friends more now than ever. China is gaining ground in EV markets and technology and Russia has expansionism in it's purview.

"The thing is, canadians are responding fairly aggressively (at least by peace-time canadian standards). The most recent election saw the Liberals win a near-majority, when but a few months ago it would have been Pollievre's Conservatives winning a landslide. Military spending is being increased, and theres a larger focus on getting stuff from other allies, like the UK. Plus theres a fair few people who've suddenly found in interest in getting their PAL licence for firearms.  Economically, supply chains are shifting to become far less dependent on the US. On the consumer side of things, canadians are mostly boycotting american goods and not traveling to the states, and aside from the liquor being pulled off the shelves in some provinces, most of that consumer action is entirely grassroots.   I'd hazard most canadians are taking things seriously, but quietly.

"Lots of Americans are saying this but far too many Americans are divided and completely silent on this. Not nearly enough Americans are speaking up loudly enough and making their voices heard to their spineless and pathetically weak ass politicians.  You see how Trump significantly united most Canadians since the beginning of the year and how our patriotism and sense of duty increased exponentially?  The people in charge in the US have overwhelmingly been silent on Canada because they are weak af and afraid to publicly speak up against king orange.    The US has deeply betrayed and offended Canada on the world stage, and that’s just a fact that too many Americans can’t seem to grasp or just simply don’t give a rats ass about. But whatever, we will suffer but survive and become more resilient thanks to this betrayal. The damage is done, some Canadians will forgive or forget or let things slide and continue to spend money on American goods (including US travel), but far more will never forget or forgive this betrayal and will avoid the US and US made products like the plague for the foreseeable future, well beyond your next election (if any) and a return to a far more stable and sensible government.",Financial_Screen_351,2025-05-05T14:50:54,4
