"So this guy is a Republican Christian and not a Jesus Christian, obviously.  There’s a big difference.",dbuck1964,2025-05-09T09:39:08,32
"Anyone with the slightest modicum of self-respect or sense of decency will simply not attend the World Cup being held in the U.S. -  as a way of giving the shit-hole Trump-MAGA crime regime a gigantic, collective middle finger. That would be the right, decent thing to do, imo.",haiku2572,2025-05-09T09:47:11,28
"It would be much more helpful to us if you just didn't come. Don't come here, don't spend any money here, just don't.",taz_78,2025-05-09T09:38:02,40
Why the fuck would anyone want to stay here anymore. Thanks to these clowns people won’t even come just for the games.,cwatson390,2025-05-09T09:46:56,12
"For once i agree with Vance, don’t come to this country, this country is now a MAGA infested shithole and there are far better options to visit out there anyways",DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-05-09T10:17:52,12
"Nothing boosts a struggling economy like scaring off tourists. Maybe JD Vance can hand out MAGA-branded “Welcome to America (Enter at Your Own Risk)” pamphlets at the airport. Real five-star hospitality vibes, just bring your own bunker.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T11:10:18,7
"Yep, this is ripe for American to show how much it has fallen under this regime. Is there a betting pool for how many embarrassing interactions at the border will happen?",BringOn25A,2025-05-09T09:45:08,4
"I would not recommend coming here, it's not safe anymore.",Succubus-Love,2025-05-09T10:04:08,6
Maybe FIFA should skip the world cup. But it will not happen because the are whores of the rich.,turbo662025,2025-05-09T11:37:36,3
I think it would be a strong message sent to us if we had a World Cup with empty stadiums.  If I were a South or Central American athlete or tourist I’d be very nervous given how they loosely interpret gang affiliation. To me there’s nothing in this world where I’d want to risk being detained over.,hmr0987,2025-05-09T11:54:21,2
Boycott? Move it somewhere else?,Weird-Ad7562,2025-05-09T13:13:40,2
I'm sure some people traveled to Berlin in 1934 to see the Olympics as well.,CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-09T10:00:46,1

Lol dude hate to break it to you but look how many people went to Russia and Qatar,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-09T09:48:43,11
Didn't they tell you that it is only the club World Cup? They pretend as if it were a big business.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-05-09T11:00:12,5

I went to South Africa and Brazil for the world cup. Skipped out on Russia and Qatar. Wasn't purely a political stance but just 0 desire to even go to those countries but maybe that feeling was subconsciously due to who they are,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-09T10:13:02,7
