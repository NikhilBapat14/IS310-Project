"Of course they will, and they don't need convincing.  But they needed soundbites and headlines saying they were against them.  They take the stance now, then pass the cuts eventually.  Even when confronted, they'll say it's tough times and we gotta tighten our belts, they'll say it was forced and necessary, they'll say it wasn't that bad, they'll say they barely touched it.  But realistically, the biggest thing doing numbers will be the soundbites.  Like saying Project 2025 wasn't the plan, and his base believing that. To this day many of them still believe that, if they can even remember it exists, despite how blatantly it was and still is the fucking plan.  So yeah, these headlines are intended to create a narrative that they're not making major cuts.  When they inevitably make major cuts, they then gaslight that truth.  Eventually their base, even while suffering as their healthcare is cut from under them, will be angry their particular benefits were cut ""incorrectly"", as their politicians told them it wasn't going to get cut! They'll then blame Dems and ""bureaucrats"" not implementing it right.  Meanwhile, they'll praise everyone else who loses benefits as cutting fraud and abuse.  These are deeply stupid people and the cult is perfectly fine drinking the punch.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-07T18:32:44,5

"The US is going the way of all empires. The reality is that even had Trump lost, the economic effects drawing the U.S. to its sunset would still be trending in the same direction, only slower. Perhaps another 10-20 years before our lack of competitiveness in the wage market, our debts getting called in, and losing our reserve currency status brings things to a final close.  It's not the end of the world to be a fading Empire; the UK has been mostly okay (until recently) for the last century as their Empire slowly evaporated.  But, having Trump in power is like slamming on the accelerator towards an open gap at the end of the freeway, instead of taking the last off-ramp to a retirement home.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T18:34:26,2

"No Empire has ever managed to reverse its decline, and I'm not sure how we could do it without 3 massive changes: gut Medicare/Medicaid, gut the Military and raising taxes on the wealthy. These 3 things run bills into the hundreds of billions each, while literally everything else we argue about combines to be barely into the billions. The math just doesn't work out. Who gives a shit about Meals on Wheels and other small social programs costing millions. It's peanuts.  Every time people talk about fixing the U.S. deficit they never seem to acknowledge the fundamental reality in difficulty in achieving some/all of the above. The majority of people don't want either of the first two happening, and the rich and powerful don't want the third happening. My hopes are basically nil that such a thing can happen.  So, the only options left are catastrophic collapse, or gradual decline and soft-landing among other developed nations.   With Trump and Republicans in power at this pivotal moment, my money's on the former.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-08T09:18:11,1
"Most people are aware of where all the money is going but politicians on both sides are intransigent when it comes to changing the status quo. That goes for most voters too. I'm on Social Security and Medicare, I certainly don't want those to go away.     The cans just keep getting kicked down the road but in less than a decade, they're going to hit a brick wall.",jarchack,2025-05-08T09:54:23,2
"Right, that's my point; there's really no future version of the U.S. I can envision where this path of ours reverses course; we're just going to keep putting everything on the credit card, and in order to avoid defaulting on our debts, we'll just keep printing so much money the value of the dollar collapses. Or, with this Administration, it collapses even sooner because other countries start selling their dollars (calling in our debts) because they're no longer convinced the U.S. is a country for adults.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-08T11:03:14,1
