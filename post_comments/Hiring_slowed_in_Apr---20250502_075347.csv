Beat the estimate though by 39k (177k actual vs. 138k estimate)  Crazy the article doesn't even mention that lol,themagicalpanda,2025-05-02T07:57:36,-5
"This was a very good jobs report. Low unemployment as well. It was a solid report. Not saying it won’t decrease, but the economy is still pretty stong",Current_Animator7546,2025-05-02T08:08:07,-3
"""It was less horrible than expected"" isn't exactly a win.",ZebTheFourth,2025-05-02T07:59:10,7
How many jobs were lost leading up to that? How many federal workers were suddenly without a job in March?,_C2J_,2025-05-02T09:16:10,3
"Honestly strong to a level that I don't believe it.  There is simply no way with companies that are freezing or reducing spending in the face of the tariffs market uncertainly, as well as adding 6 digits worth of DOGE government cuts, that the numbers are good.  The books feel cooked.",Serapth,2025-05-02T08:13:30,4
"No it actually wasn't less horrible than expected.   The estimate was 137k. It beat that. Put it in perspective - April 2024 jobs report was reported at 175k. Even with everything going on, the number is better YoY.",themagicalpanda,2025-05-02T08:04:10,-1
"The DOGE cuts have largely put people on administrative leave rather than outright firings, and there's a constant game of back and forth on ""you're fired,"" ""no you have to rehire them because you cant fire them like this.""  Anyone on administrative leave who's being paid through the FedGov doesn't count on these reports.",Areyounobody__Too,2025-05-02T08:15:28,2
"It's down 51,000 from last month.",ZebTheFourth,2025-05-02T08:05:40,6
"""It beat that""  Can you explain to me why you believe the numbers?   Trump is the one that controls this, so why wouldn't he direct them to release data that makes him look good?  You actually think they are EVER going to release anything that makes him look bad?  This type of thing concerns me because it makes me wonder if people actually do not really understand the type of authoritarian government we now have",[deleted],2025-05-02T08:09:59,1
"That’s not uncommon though. 177K is very good. Last month was exceptionally good. I hate Trump, but this was a good report. It may get revised down later. It best estimates by 30K. We will gaze to see though. Tariffs haven’t really hit the economy yet ",Current_Animator7546,2025-05-02T08:11:08,1
"The jobs number came in better than expected for this month. So even with everything going on, the job market is still very strong. Unemployment rate stayed the same.  And if you read the BLS report, March was actually revised down from 228k to 185k.  I'm still not sure the point you're trying to prove.",themagicalpanda,2025-05-02T08:11:06,0
March was revised down from 228k to 185k FYI.,themagicalpanda,2025-05-02T08:11:46,2
"Wipe your chin, bro. He's not going to replace your absent father. You can't magically bullshit your way into convincing anyone that Trump's economy is good.  > And if you read the BLS report, March was actually revised down from 228k to 185k.  So you're confirming that last month was worse than initially reported and this month is still worse than that. And will probably be revised down even more. Got it.  Go back to your daytrading subreddit and try to convince everyone else to go long. How underwater are you?",ZebTheFourth,2025-05-02T09:42:10,1
