"Looks like some grunts screwed up and tried to cover their tracks.   The problem here is Israel not doing the right thing and prosecuting their own, that's all that would be needed to close the loop.  Problem solved, move on.",DRKMSTR,2025-04-20T21:54:53,60

"I don't discount the tragedy that happened.  BUT this has been hanging the news cycle for how long now?  When some Muslim fires a rocket into an Israeli neighborhood of innocent people or a terrorist blows up a bus of children, it barely gets a single segment in the news.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-20T16:57:32,187

While this is a tragic accident (from many months ago) I’m much more worried about the stuff Hamas is doing intentionally every day.,UltraAirWolf,2025-04-21T08:14:49,2
It doesn't happen often that countries will prosecute their own during war time. Look at the bombing of Dresden. War is simply ugly.,The_Asian_Viper,2025-04-21T02:15:50,5
"Israel may have pulled the trigger, but it was Hamas who killed them.  Remember that.  They use human shields.  They are the war criminals culpable for that for their brazen abuse of the Laws and Customs of War.  Edit: to all the downvoters, as an exercise, please look up perfidy and who bears the responsibility for the consequences of it.",ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-20T19:19:03,-174
"I think part of the reason it feels like it has been lingering in the news cycle is the “discovery” aspect. At first the allegation was denied. Then further and further information came to light, each time breathing new life into the story.",MCRNRocinante,2025-04-20T18:25:21,235
I mean Israel has much more influence on our gov,Florida__Man__,2025-04-20T17:01:02,214
"It's a hard line to walk.  We should expect more of an ally or any nation that we do of a terrorist group. That why the terrorists deserved bombed to hell and a country does not.   Shitty people doing shitty things isn't newsworthy enough to continue being a story, especially when you can just report on the shitty thing they do next.  A responsible and good government doing something shitty is rare and thus newsworthy.  The other side of it is accidents happen, as do poor decisions. Treating them the same as intentionally slaughtering children like terrorists do isn't fair either.  And then there's the Israel part. They always get more criticism of what they do than anyone else.",cathbadh,2025-04-21T06:44:52,11
"And 6 out of those ""paramedics"" were Hamas terrorists. They frequently disguise themselves as paramedics and use the ambulances to get around because they figured it's a clever way to avoid being attacked.",Long_Most1204,2025-04-20T17:33:30,-34

"Israel = modern civilization.   Palestine/Gaza = Hamas, terrorism, clinging to ancient traditions and Islamic reversal of civilization to centuries ago, where women are property and not allowed in public alone or uncovered, children are objects, and men bow to a moon god many times a day HOPING said moon god will look down on them pleased when they die.",ITrCool,2025-04-20T19:44:27,0

So when a bomber kills a bus load of Israeli children it should be part of the news cycle? I am asking what you are saying. What does your comment have to do with what I posted?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-20T17:05:58,-72

Spin the money all you like. I’m still siding with Israel if forced to pick between the two. No way am I going anywhere near what Hamas believes and does. They’re not justified in any way. Not even remotely.,ITrCool,2025-04-20T20:49:40,20
A plurality of Israel's population are the Mizrahi Jews who fled the ethnic cleansing campaigns against them following the failures of the Arab League's wars to wipe out Israel.  But of course you'll never complain about that.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-21T07:52:37,2
"""Had their homes stolen from them"" and that's all we need from you to know you know less than fuck all about the topic. Thanks for playing better luck next time.   When you side with the people who literqlly call for the eradication of an entire race in their governing documents you should probably make sure you have the facts before you start with your word vomit.",The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-21T12:23:58,1

"I guess you haven't been paying attention to the West Bank. Bus depot bombing about a month or so ago,  it was mis-timed, so no casualties.  There's been plenty of other bombings in the West Bank since the October 7 attack.   Unrelated, but similar,  Hezbollah killed a whole soccer field of children with a rocket just within the past year.   This is an ideological war, and the Iranian government is at the center of it with all these proxies. I hope the people of Iran overthrow that regime and bring stability back to the region.  Otherwise, this will continue, it seems.   Before you call anyone out on fake news,  maybe you should be watching an independent source like TBN Israel on YouTube.  Watch the boots on the ground report with Yair Pinto. I've watched it since shortly after the attack. Every day. Before you claim they're IDF propaganda, Trinity Broadcast Network is a U.S. based Christian network.",vialentvia,2025-04-21T09:30:41,-4

"I guess you didn’t read this subthread carefully.   Guy talked about a bomber killing a bus load of Israeli children.  I pointed out that that hasn’t happened in a generation.  You gave other random examples of things that aren’t a bomber blowing up a bus load of children.  It’s not that complicated.   Yes, I’m probably just being upvoted by fucking liberals, but I’m trying to make sure we stick to the facts here.",Harvard_Med_USMLE267,2025-04-21T11:16:02,7

"Please provide all accounts of the Gazan people openly denouncing them, turning them in to the IDF, and protesting Hamas’ activities in the region.   Last I saw, they had openly elected them into their provisional government and praise what they do.",ITrCool,2025-04-20T21:05:57,35

"You do understand that for most Palestinians who dislike Hamas, their preferred choice is something like Lions Den, Islamic Jihad, or some other organization *more* extreme than Hamas. It's not like they all like Fatah / Palestinian Authority, which to be clear is noticeably better (though still not *great*).",zVitiate,2025-04-20T21:27:51,28
"Thank you for your contribution, fellow conservative  75 percent of Palestinians supported the october massacre.  60 percent of Palestinians supported hamas at the time that poll was taken.   They also elected them.  But please, continue with your astroturfing campaign.",chii0628,2025-04-21T07:09:11,11
"Does it really matter that it's specifically a bus load of Israeli children?  I'm not giving a pass because it seems like splitting hairs when there's so many examples of just that very terrorism exclusively also involving buses or children.  It's like comparing OKC bombing to the first WTC bombing.  They both involved bombing a building,  but because one killed children, it's somehow different?   Rockets landing in schools, etc.  Sure, the IDF has bombed Palestinian schools.  The difference is the IDF told them they were going to do it and allowed them to evacuate.    These ""first responders"" ran into soldiers amped up from an earlier ambush attempt. There's so much drone footage of Hamas using ambulances and one of them actually being Hamas in this incident. I give them a pass on this one because how do you know who is who when Hamas hides in the population?  Bottom line is that the Palestinians voted for this and still stick by them indiscriminately killing Israelis to see to the destruction of the Jewish state by any means necessary. It's fair game in my book. The IDF has done a MUCH better job at minimizing casualties than the Allies did in Europe. This shit is ragebait.",vialentvia,2025-04-21T11:29:57,1
