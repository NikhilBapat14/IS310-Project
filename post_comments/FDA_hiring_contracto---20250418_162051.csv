Call me crazy but when I was a contractor doing freelance work I charged about 4x what I make as a salary.  I feel like it woulda been cheaper to just *not* do this.  So.. which one of the president or his lackey's friends are getting a big payday?,DasRobot85,2025-04-18T16:29:38,20
Iâ€™m confused. Whatâ€™s the point of the FDA if not to do safety inspections?  Also WHY IS DOGE JUST ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY CUTS ANYWHERE!? That goes far beyond their congressional mandate,annaleigh13,2025-04-18T16:23:51,7

They donâ€™t have a congressional mandate at all. Theyâ€™re a criminal gang that keeps infiltrating the government and people keep following what they do (when the police and fbi arenâ€™t backing them).,freexanarchy,2025-04-18T16:35:45,7
Technically theyâ€™re a renamed division with the mandate to upgrade the federal software systems.,annaleigh13,2025-04-18T16:36:36,1
