Don’t people get it? (Of course they don’t). Trump is a fucking white supremacist and he doesn’t believe non-white people belong in this country other than to be subjugated. “Mistakenly deported” brown guy? 🙄  Come on folks.   The “illegal immigrant” and “border” trope is manufactured bullshit to disguise the real desire of these people - no immigrants (unless you’re from Russia or Norway or the white parts of Europe).,SoftwareHot,2025-04-07T11:47:19,17

It's unlikely this individual is dead yet in my book.

"The answer is PRECEDENT  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent  The process used to determine who and how an individual was selected and removed has not been disclosed which is truly frightening.   However I did read that somehow tattoos are assigned ""points"" and a determination of gang affilliation is being assigned by a points system.   Makes you wonder what the criteria really is if they're not looking at criminal records.  Due Process has not been applied.  Equally so, no one has been returned.  The FIRST TIME something shifts this process by judicial review and order, sets PRECEDENT. This then means anyone else can ALSO cite this instance as the reason they too should be allowed the same, equal treatment. In this case, returning the individual to the US.  If you don't let ANYONE out, there is no PRECEDENT.  They are working hard to make sure that no one will, even if they screwed up.",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-08T04:09:29,2
