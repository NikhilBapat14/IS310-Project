"I'm doing my part. Another year of not buying a Tesla and it gets easier every day.  And like, really important to note, this is not only because the company is owned by a reprhensible nazi prick whose careless actions are going to get a lot of real people really killed.   It's easier not to buy one because of how clearly the company sucks. Musk has sucked all the life and value out of it. Tesla used to have a reputation as a shop of the most talented engineers in the world, making the next generation of vehicle.   Musk has thoroughly enshittified everything about the company. Their new products are nonexistent. Their last major release was the ugliest, stupidest looking vehicle I've ever had the displeasure to lay eyes on, designed extremely poorly with some of the most unjustifiable engineering decisions in auto-making history. It will go down as a business legend in terms of fuck-ups.   And that's what the company is.  If this were 10 years ago, it might be tough for me to let go of wanting a Tesla. Today, it's not. I have no desire to own one entirely on the merits of how shitty a company they are and how clearly trash their products are.  This is why this isn't just going to go away with Musk. His entire ethos has seeped into the entire way the company operates, and they have on their own merits lost a great deal of the respect they used to have.  And it's really sad. If Musk had only kept pretending to be iron man in public and just fucking off from social media and the world with his billions, they'd still be a world-class shop.   Instead, this one man soaked in like a cancer, ensthiffiying the product itself, the business practices, the reputaiton. Everything that makes a company special.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-02T16:26:06,65

Elon got control of Tesla after the cars were a reality. He only was involved with the engineering of the truck that arrived 4 years after it was promised and has turned into a rolling and sitting nightmare,Musty_track,2025-05-02T22:39:57,10

"To be fair to the insufferable prick, he was heavily involved in the Model 3 and Model Y. Those were the days when he would sleep at the factory. Those cars were a big success, but those days are long gone. The new models are refreshes, which is interesting considering how supposedly valuable the company is on paper. If the company was so rich, you would think they could be all new designs. But alas, the nazi is too busy with actively harming everyone in the US and in reality probably bored of Tesla.",aquilles10,2025-05-02T22:55:12,4
