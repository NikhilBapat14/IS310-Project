"Imagine entering Disneyland (even illegally) and demanding that the Walt Disney Company be required to admit you inside and allow you to remain until a judge determines whether or not you have had ""due process."" That is: Imagine that you demanded that you can reside inside the park as long as you wished until a judge determined whether or not you have a right to be there.   If that were permitted, the lines in Disneyland would be much, much longer than they are now. In fact, few people would pay admission because the park would be filled to the brink with freeloaders seeking ""due process.""  That is what happened to our immigration court system.",chrismireya,2025-05-07T16:32:22,8
"CORRECTION: A liberal judge appointed by Joe Biden declares that 12,000 foreign citizens who are applying for ""refugee"" status must be admitted and then have their cases individually adjudicated.   A good solution for this would be to say that they can still have their cases adjudicated -- but only at U.S. consulates and embassies. In other words, these foreign nationals could still get their ""day in court"" but not in the United States. They will have to wait their turn.",chrismireya,2025-05-07T14:48:28,16
