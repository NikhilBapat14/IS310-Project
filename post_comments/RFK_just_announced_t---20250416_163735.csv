"I like trump but the this stuff is ridiculous.  The reason autism diagnosis is so prevalent now is because the diagnostic criteria changed as they have understood it more.  It was changed in the 90s, and then in 2013.  If we had known about it in 1970 the way we do now the numbers would have been similar.   This entire thing is a non story  EDIT: since certain people in this sub have accused me of being a brigader, im just gonna add this in here:  The reason you see more autistic people now as opposed to 20-40 years ago is because in those days autistic people were rarely in school, many of them were (and in some places still are) incarcerated, beaten, forced into all kinds of horrendous, inhumane kinds “therapy” and were not even entitled to attend school in many cases  RFK is going through it to find out what has been hidden from us about it, the rates will appear to have gone up (because of the previously mentioned diagnostic criteria)  The possible causes will absolutely have been hidden away by sketchy pharma companies who may have a hand in it, but to pretend this is a recent phenomena is liberal levels of stupid.  There is a level of ignorance about this subject among conservatives. It does not make you conservative to ignore the way the medical community does diagnosis, and making anecdotal points about “muh daddy said there were less autisms in the old days” makes you look as ignorant as liberals when they call you an anti vaxxer for not wanting an untested drug being poured into your system.",Xander_hades_,2025-04-16T17:21:33,204
"They have been saying the ""diagnostic criteria"" change lie for as long as I've researched and followed this, which has now been about 20 years.    It's funny as hell they point to this scapegoat, which only explains a small amount of the increase, then pretend that can account for the massive increased prevlance.  Beyond that one excuse, they have no ideas what it could be.    But they are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE what isn't causing it.  😏",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T17:47:02,-9
"There's speculation that with Autism we might be seeing the next stage of Human evolution happening before our eyes.  Studies are ongoing, but we're not likely to have an answer in either direction without hundreds of more years of data, at minimum.  Autism doesn't typically hinder breeding, except for in the most extreme cases and often leads to greater cognition, which is an advantageous trait.  So in terms of natural selection, it adds up.  Although, as we develop socially and technologically as a species, we are increasingly pushing natural selection to the side.  Our modern medical technology allows some people, who without medical intervention, would have died in infancy, to live to breeding age and beyond (and I'm not saying that this is a bad thing, not at all, just highlighting that this is one way that we might be taking control of our own destiny as a species and potentially lessening the role of natural selection).  Societal safety nets designed to protect those in genuine need (which, again, are a good thing, for those that do genuinely need it), can be exploited by the feckless and lazy.  It's true that some people 'make a living' by just pumping out kids and living on government benefits.  These people aren't usually our best and brightest, but in terms of breeding, these people are 'successful.'  They also tend to treat their kids as a statistic, or a meal ticket, so don't put effort into raising them right, so the cycle perpetuates with each generation.",ExcellentEffort1752,2025-04-17T05:51:18,0
"While increased diagnostic criteria can explain some of it, ignoring possible catalysts due to this lazy explanation is just stupid.  We heard the same thing about why does everyone in the US have a peanut allergy now, and then it was proven that the increase was due to everyone putting their children in a bubble so they’re not exposed to peanuts.",SetOk6462,2025-04-17T06:53:27,0
"""there were less autisms in the old days""  when someone said ""this person is autistic""   everyone knews what you mean.       now, its ""you have a quirk""  because the range of it self-diagnosed all the way to can't communicate/feed yourself/wipe yourself.",TooHotTea,2025-04-18T18:25:01,4
"The autism rates aren't fully explained by changes in screening, and you seem to acknowledge it to an extent with the ""sketchy pharma companies"" addition. Autism is a pretty broad diagnosis, so I could envision it as an ensemble of causes working in concert. Even if pharmaceuticals were one of them and the data was buried, there are probably some environmental factors that are correlated that might be addressable. I think the most defensible critique is that some people just don't trust RFK to carry out an honest investigation. I don't share that fear, so in my view I think a lot of good can come from having a public dialogue about all of this.",Brilliant-Diver8138,2025-04-17T02:59:17,12
"I’m sorry, but your take is absolutely fucking ridiculous. The “we just diagnose it more” absolutely fails the eyeball test. In fairness to you, yes rates of autism are up **partially** because a lot of high functioning kids with autism were not diagnosed in the 90’s as they would be today, and were instead considered hyperactive or classified as ADHD (which is very common with autism as well). The moderate to severe cases were almost unheard of then, and are absolutely more common today.  Talk to any long term pediatrician, or any school teacher who worked for decades, and ask them how many kids displayed signs of what we now consider moderate to severe autism in the 1980’s, 1990’s vs today.  You’re entirely off base with the “it’s just diagnosed more”. Yes, it’s technically true an extent for high functioning individuals. But over all, it’s blatantly obvious that that’s not the case when it comes to children with moderate to severe cases of autism.",LysanderSpoonersCat,2025-04-16T19:37:01,10
also there is seems to be strong correlation on diet with autism. More ultra processed foods (especially sugar and fructose) to an abnormal brain development,LastManSleeping,2025-04-16T18:58:06,-5

The reason its more visible now is because back in the old days they would literally lock people away for having more serious cases of it,Xander_hades_,2025-04-16T22:46:31,44
"BUT it hasn’t exploded in the last 20 years because of anything other than diagnosis criteria, and anyone who says they didnt see it much before then is usually an ignorant boomer who ignores the massive abuses and incarceration of autistic people.  The general fact that it’s way more prevalent than we knew means either people have been exposed to something sketchy in food or vaccines for the past half century (which would explain liberal hysteria over the vaccine research being looked at) or humans are just way more defective than we realize, since they already proved a while ago there is genetic cause of autism.  Ultimately, and I can tell you this as an autistic person, most of the excess diagnosis will not be anything to do with chemicals or vaccines, it will be down to a mix of parents abusing their bodies during pregnancy (alcohol and drug addiction) and these pathetic TikTok/pinterest morons that decided they are autistic, got an assessment after carefully studying others who actually have it and then got a real diagnosis so they could claim welfare and then lord it over the rest of us and claim “high functioning” and “aspie” is offensive to us when no one gives a fuck.  Sorry for the rant but in any case it isnt a new phenomen",Xander_hades_,2025-04-17T07:13:38,31
"Hey man, get that logic out of here!    The ""diagnostic criteria"" scapegoat that has been used in the face of ever rising incidence over the past couple decades.  Doesn't matter that it makes little logical sense and can't explain what is clearly visible.  What matters is that it allows people who don't want the burden of having to really think about it to be uncomfortable and rethink any basic tenants of possible causality.        This sub is totally lost to astroturfing and brigading.  May as well call it r/politics at this point.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-16T21:09:06,12

I imagine the diet and drug use of parents contributes as well.  ,Junknail,2025-04-26T08:28:08,1

"Really?  That's all you got?  Regurgitated talking points from a one page google search?  Yep, I saw you shilling that in your other comment.  The liberals and bots in here loved it, that should be your red herring.    When it first started being seen it was called Cold Mother Syndrome and had a relatively rare prevalence.  Over time it increased in prevalence.  I'm not going to go diving for actual numbers, but since I haven't exactly been presented with any from Redditors telling me I'm wrong (big surprise) I don't feel the need to be more evidence-based than thou.  It was 1:300 or something in the 80s/90s.  When the early 00s it moved to like 1:130.  Then it progressively ticked up to 1:30 recently.  This new data released saying 1:12.  The last time I really looked at the data the rate was somewhere in 1:90 range.    This entire time the only commonly accepted and largely pushed theory of explanation was diagnostic criteria.  This is convenient for people who have a vested interest in the skyrocketing prevalence not being analyzed.    Just from a logical perspective this is bonkers.  It's insane that the overall prevalence can be this increased and everyone is more than happy shrugging their shoulders and saying ""we've always had it like this, we just know about it now"".  You can keep making this argument, but it's a dumb argument just snatched from the conclusion portions of sociological journals and regurgitated by mainstream media to discredit alternative explanations.  The only reality where this is a comprehensive explanation for the phenomenon is one where the criteria has been altered so dramatically as to deliberately skew data, which demolishes the credibility of the argument anyways.  No reality exists where an intelligent person can stand on the data presented and say it is all accurate methodologically and explains a prevalence increase this extreme.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-17T08:07:24,-4
"I’m the guy from your other comment, but it actually has “exploded” in the past 20 years or so, so I’m not sure why you’re saying it hasn’t.   And while I haven’t even mentioned the vaccines, I think that is kind of your defensiveness on the topic, and it is at least  curious that when vaccine makers were given complete liability protection in 1989 (or around there) we also immediately and significantly increased the number of childhood vaccines that were recommended by like fivefold, which also correlates with the rise of autism of those kids born after that and came of age or diagnosis in the early 00’s.  Now again, I’m not saying correlation = causation, but to just be shut down immediately and dismissed by bringing those actual facts up because the golden V word is involved is really bizarre to me.   I’m not even blaming vaccines necessarily (because I know vaccines are sacrosanct), but the fact that people can’t even dare say anything about them is just really weird to me.  Frances Kelsey was a “nut job” 3/4 of a century ago for recommending that kids don’t get injected with Thalidomide, but thank God she didn’t care how she was portrayed, because she saved an entire generation in this country.  *Edit: just to put a period on my comment because I don’t know when I’ll be able to respond:*  *I believe that vaccinations are a net positive, but I also believe that we are giving young children way, way, way too many vaccines starting at birth compared to what we used to do*",LysanderSpoonersCat,2025-04-17T16:32:12,6
"Yep, watching my comment go to -7 within maybe 2 minutes, and eventually going to +10 overnight where it sits now was just more proof of how brigaded this sub has been for the last 3 months or so. Not that I needed any more proof.   But on the actual issue, you’re 100% correct. It’s truly bizarre to me that people actually can’t even acknowledge that it’s blatantly obvious that autism rates are significantly higher than they used to be, and just saying “it’s diagnosed more now” makes absolutely no sense. If moderate to severe autism was always the same and it’s just because we “diagnose it more” then I’d like someone to show me where the correlation drop is in whatever they were diagnosed with before. Forget your eyes, just someone show me the corresponding drop that makes the numbers make sense.",LysanderSpoonersCat,2025-04-17T16:26:10,2

"Sigh, ok so let me see. You start by saying “I don’t like that you are repeating a point from google and therefore it is wrong” then it’s “I think you are a liberal and so you are wrong” then you move on to saying “I don’t have actual numbers but neither do you so it’s fine” and “nobody gave me a reason I’m wrong so I must be right” then you go on to basically say “I don’t like your explanation and that people accept it and I think that’s crazy” then you finish strong by once again saying “you are wrong because you share your opinions with sources I disagree with” not a great argument here bud.
