"* [Exclusive: DOGE staffer 'Big Balls' provided tech support to cybercrime ring, records show](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-staffer-big-balls-provided-tech-support-cybercrime-ring-records-show-2025-03-26/)  > The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.  * [DOGE software engineer’s computer infected by info-stealing malware](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/doge-software-engineers-computer-infected-by-info-stealing-malware/)  >Login credentials belonging to an employee at both the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Department of Government Efficiency have appeared in multiple public leaks from info-stealer malware, a strong indication that devices belonging to him have been hacked in recent years.  * [NLRB whistleblower claims Musk’s DOGE potentially caused significant security breach](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/nlrb-whistleblower-claims-musks-doge-potentially-caused-significant-security-breach)  * [A whistleblower's disclosure details how DOGE may have taken sensitive labor data](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security)  >Meanwhile, according to the disclosure and records of internal communications, members of the DOGE team asked that their activities not be logged on the system and then appeared to try to cover their tracks behind them, turning off monitoring tools and manually deleting records of their access — evasive behavior that several cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR compared to what criminal or state-sponsored hackers might do.   ...   Within minutes after DOGE accessed the NLRB's systems, someone with an IP address in Russia started trying to log in, according to Berulis' disclosure. The attempts were ""near real-time,"" according to the disclosure. Those attempts were blocked, but they were especially alarming. Whoever was attempting to log in was using one of the newly created DOGE accounts — and the person had the correct username and password, according to Berulis. While it's possible the user was disguising their location, it's highly unlikely they'd appear to be coming from Russia if they wanted to avoid suspicion, cybersecurity experts interviewed by NPR explained.  The data they're taking from us is going straight to foreign threat actors.",brain_overclocked,2025-05-09T15:10:24,23
