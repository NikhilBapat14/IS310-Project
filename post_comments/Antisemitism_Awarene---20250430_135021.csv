"So basically Republicans didn't like it when Bernie Sanders introduced carve-outs that said it wasn't antisemitic to protest Israel's actions in Palestine, said it wasn't antisemitic to distribute written material on college campuses concerning the issue, and opposed the renovation of student visas on the issue.   Republicans don't give a shit about antisemitism - they just care about covering for Israel.",walkallover1991,2025-04-30T13:55:55,12
Antisemitism needs awareness because of those who conflate anti Israel/Zionism with actual antisemitism. Good for Bernie.,Rick_McCrawfordler,2025-04-30T14:04:29,1
"Here is the beginning of the story:  Senators on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee postponed a final vote on advancing the [Antisemitism Awareness Act](https://jewishinsider.com/2024/12/how-the-antisemitism-awareness-act-fell-apart/) after approving four amendments that could jeopardize GOP support for the bill and leave its future passage once again in question.   Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the committee’s chair and a major proponent of the legislation, told *Jewish Insider* after the meeting that he needed to postpone the vote because Republicans could not return to the committee room quickly enough to vote for it, with just minutes remaining before a two-hour cut-off to the meeting. Democrats refused requests to waive the two-hour limit.  “I couldn’t get my people back. And Democrats have limited debate until noon as an obvious tactic to defeat the bill,” Cassidy said. “They don’t care if Jewish students are harassed on college campuses. And so that is a procedural way in which, if you limit the two hours and we can’t get our votes back, then we can’t have the vote.”  Cassidy, who opposed all of the approved amendments other than a largely technical one he introduced, said that they were “problematic” and that he would have to survey other committee members to determine whether they would still support the bill.  He vowed in a statement after the hearing that he would continue working to pass the bipartisan legislation.",jewish_insider,2025-04-30T13:50:45,-3
"Little w for Bernie on this issue.  If everyone in congress thought like him today (or more boldly to the left of this), I would think we might have a ceasefire today",KingThar,2025-04-30T14:01:34,4
"And Israeli media is now reporting that Biden did little to nothing to encourage a ceasefire.  Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Herzog said, “God did the State of Israel a favor that Biden was the president during this period. We fought \[in Gaza\] for over a year and the administration never came to us and said, ‘ceasefire now.’ It never did. And that’s not to be taken for granted.”  Biden did basically nothing, gave Israel essentially whatever they wanted, provided international cover, and *still* got fucked in the ass.",walkallover1991,2025-04-30T14:07:43,6
