"Putin is trying to make a deal with the U.S. to invest in Arctic oil and natural gas.  Exxon, Shell, and Chevron have been wanting access to this for decades.  Exxon alone currently operates in 60 countries.  This is also a part of the larger picture for how Greenland plays into it.   Also, Russia is a superpower in military only.  They have practically no industry other than oil and natural gas and maybe vodka.",crucial_geek,2025-04-09T08:26:04,2
