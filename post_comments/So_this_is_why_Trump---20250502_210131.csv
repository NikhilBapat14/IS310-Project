"Either he is extremely impulsive or his West Wing is incompetent. I don't know what's more likely.  We know Donald Trump is not playing with graphs and figures by himself. He didn't graduate past crayons and construction paper. Someone gave this to him. A staffer, obviously. And clearly a senior staffer if they had ready access to him (unless the whole chain of command is dumb). It is very disturbing that this White House is this incompetent.  I mean, in 2017 he was still Trump. But he had James Mattis at Defense and Rex Tillerson at State and Mike Pence who's a dick but knows how to lead. Sure there was chaos in his communications office, but now it's everywhere. RFK, Noem, Hegseth, Miller, and a bunch of billionaires in the cabinet and elsewhere in the West Wing. It's a mess. Little Marco Rubio is really the only politically-knowledgeable adult in the cabinet room. Thank God he's at State.",KR1735,2025-05-03T00:08:17,15

This is just him lying, and possible his team knowing that if they have to they can say well it‚Äôs this figure so it becomes a half truth where his supporters will just say oh so he wasn‚Äôt lying then and just keep supporting him more.
