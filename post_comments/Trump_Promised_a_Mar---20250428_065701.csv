"From Bloomberg News reporter [Esha Dey](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASwsU2kC03Q/esha-dey):  Donald Trump promised Americans a “[boom like no other](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/SSYOACTVI5MO)” if they elected him president. But based on the stock market’s performance during his first 100 days in office, it depends on what you mean by “boom.”  The action certainly has been explosive — just not in the way investors were hoping. By April 30, Trump will have closed out his first 100 days in office. Despite last week’s rally, the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPX:IND) is down about 8% since his inauguration and on track for its worst run during a president’s first 100 days since Gerald Ford in 1974, following Richard Nixon’s resignation.  It’s a U-turn [few on Wall Street saw coming](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/wall-street-bets-on-new-riches-ahead-in-markets-all-in-on-trump) after two straight years of over 20% gains and what was expected to be a pro-growth agenda. Instead, markets swung wildly as Trump slapped tariffs on basically every country where US companies operate — and then suspended some, carved out exceptions for certain industries, and ratcheted up the trade war with China.  The disruptions, combined with the administration’s aggressive push to deport undocumented workers and its mass firings of federal employees, unnerved investors and sent the S&P 500 spinning into its [seventh-fastest correction](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/us-stocks-hover-near-correction-territory-as-tariff-risks-mount) since 1929.",bloomberg,2025-04-28T06:57:28,4
"Well, he wasn't lying. Boom can mean several different things depending on how you interpret it.  The word ""boom"" is commonly understood as an explosion, so if you for instance were to explode an old casino that was bankrupt and meant for demolition, then the boom doesn't mean that the casino gets even bigger and more beautiful, it means that it actually gets destroyed.   So, Trump was quite correct when he said there would be a big boom on the stock market within 100 days.   Promise made, promise kept....",sniffstink1,2025-04-28T07:07:27,3

"Not just damage. Trillions in damages so far.  If only we had some example to go on for how Trump is economic poison.  Oh yeah, we did. His first term.  He did over 5 trillion in damage to the economy with his first round of trade wars (pre-COVID, though his mismanagement of that crisis also did trillions in unnecessary damages).  He has never been anything but a bane to America.  But it’s getting the 1% richer by leaps and bounds through market manipulation.",llahlahkje,2025-04-28T09:51:50,2

"Markets to rebound, and if they do Trump will take all the credit, but it will be in spite of not because of.       But then there is the issue of competent leadership, in the past, economically the US has had competent leadership, and yea some of you are going to disagree, but by and large that is the case, at least in the face of steep downturns. With Trump we did not elect an A-Team, and he did not appoint even a C or D-Team, so the chances of a rebound in the short run are slim.",rgvtim,2025-04-28T10:42:40,1
