"Nuclear power plants are incompatible with war if you plan to occupy the land.   Nuclear power doesn’t just turn on and off. Nuclear power is made by boiling water with rocks. Not flame.   Russian soldiers “shutting down” a nuclear reactor is actually kind of stupid because if Russia tries to shut down the Ukrainian reactor, the fallout from the explosion could pollute Russian farm land down wind from the reactor. For a long time.   > [Chernobyl Accident 1986 - Ukraine](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/chernobyl-accident.aspx)  Russia is also occupying land that relies on that nuclear power plant for electricity.   Almost all the heat to boil the water for power comes from the decay of radioactive iodine and cesium, which have half lives of 8 days and 30 years respectively. The reactor is often housed inside a large concrete dome to contain the explosion that will occur if cooling water is shut off while power is being produced by iodine decay.   > [Radionuclide Basics: Iodine](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclide-basics-iodine)  > [Radionuclide Basics: Cesium-137](https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radionuclide-basics-cesium-137)  Boron can be used to speed up the shut down of the reaction by scrubbing neutrons, but it doesn’t work like in the movies because there are long delays.   > [Boron in nuclear energy](https://www.borax.com/products/applications/nuclear-energy)   It takes around 6 weeks to “turn off” the nuclear power because you have to wait several half lives for most of the iodine to decay. The cooling water still cannot be shut off because cesium decay produces enough heat to melt the fuel rods for almost a century.   The electricity to run the water pumps in the later part of shutdown process usually comes into the nuclear power plant on the electric power lines from other power plants, but there are emergency generators with a few days of diesel that can run the water pumps in case a power line becomes inoperable.",nanoatzin,2022-09-18T11:59:57,18
"Their presence in a working nuclear plant is a rather ghastly reimagining of the concept of a human shield, and to that extent, a form of leverage the benefits of which outweigh the utility of shutting the plant down.",[deleted],2022-09-18T15:32:39,4
"Nuclear fission is created by introducing a stream of neutrons through uranium which causes it to split apart, which then releases a ton of heat. Water is introduced into the mix to create steam which powers massive turbines that generate electricity.    The heat in the uranium just doesn't stop when you shut down the reactor.   The uranium rods are so hot that they must be constantly cooled for a very long time. If you don't cool them then they melt down and then you have a worse situation and the potential for explosion which is what happened at  Chernobyl",Yggdrssil0018,2022-09-18T12:28:32,2

They could do a proper shutdown that takes weeks. I don't think OP is suggesting they blow it up.,tehboredsotheraccoun,2022-09-18T19:17:31,7
"An explosion is pretty unlikely, if not impossible - that was a quirk of the reactor design/circumstances at chernobyl. Nonetheless, a meltdown is plenty bad enough.",Trotskyist,2022-09-18T17:26:26,1

It might blow up on its own if they interfere with the power lines.   The explosion would be from ultra heated steam combined with hydrogen produced by oxidizing the fuel rods.  Nuclear power plants cannot explode like a nuclear weapon.,nanoatzin,2022-09-18T21:33:19,1
