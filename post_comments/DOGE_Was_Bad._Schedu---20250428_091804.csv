When did we start ruling by presidential decree? Someone take this idiots sharpie away.,mkstot,2025-04-28T09:25:32,134
"Concerning aspects of this executive order:  >President Donald Trump hyped the new order on Truth Social. “If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the President, or are engaging in corrupt behavior,” he wrote, “they should no longer have a job.” In the interregnum before Trump’s second term, the original Schedule F proposal was kept alive in Republican policy circles, notably by the Heritage Foundation’s influential Project 2025 document. Now rebranded as “Restoring Accountability to Policy-Influencing Positions Within the Federal Workforce,” the order focuses on the president’s authority to remove traditional civil-service protections from about 2 percent of the federal workforce and terminate them at his discretion. (The policy allows exemption for certain classes of government employees, such as Border Patrol agents.) > >Civil servants swear an oath to the Constitution, and are required to apply the laws of the United States as enacted by Congress. Their salaries are paid by all U.S. taxpayers. These obligations are every bit as important as loyalty to the president: Part of their job involves speaking truth to power, even when the facts they convey may be inconvenient and the policy choices difficult. The new order’s priority on personal fealty is clear in its grant of power to federal agencies to fire an employee for “subversion of Presidential directives.” If far more civil servants can be summarily dismissed, they’re less likely to risk frank conversations with senior administration officials. The quality of their advice will suffer, and their chief interest will be in preserving their jobs by pleasing their political masters. To an extent, the Trump administration is responding to legitimate concerns about performance and accountability within the federal bureaucracy, but replacing tens of thousands of people with political hires is highly unlikely to fix what ails the government. > >... > >A heavy reliance on political appointments can have significant downsides. Scholars have found that agencies with large numbers of political employees tend to be less successful. The average tenure of political appointees is about 2.5 years, whereas career managers tend to serve for longer periods, providing greater stability and continuity to see through major reforms. Career officials typically bring more in-depth expertise and institutional knowledge, and the agencies they lead tend to have more satisfied employees. > >The United States, in fact, already has a much higher turnover among senior bureaucrats than other advanced industrial democracies. Some 4,000 federal government positions are subject to political appointment, and roughly 1,300 require Senate confirmation. Although the U.S. civil service is about four times larger than the United Kingdom’s, for example, it has nearly 28 times as many political appointees as the U.K., which has only a few hundred such posts. The cumbersome American system of recruiting and confirming these senior officials also results in long-standing vacancies and numerous acting assignments. To scale up at-will employment across the entire federal civil service would be at best premature without more analysis and planning. > >... > >The American public likes the idea of pursuing government efficiency in the abstract but, according to polls, strongly opposes the moves that the Trump administration is now making. The most recent annual survey from the Partnership for Public Service found largely positive attitudes toward civil servants. About 95 percent of respondents thought that civil servants should be hired and promoted on merit rather than according to political beliefs, and 90 percent said that civil servants should serve the people more than any president. Only a quarter agreed that presidents should be able to fire civil servants “for any reason,” whereas 72 percent disagreed. The public does not like what Musk and DOGE are actually doing, and believes that the cuts go too far and have put sensitive data at risk.  Replacing employees with appointees is not going to make the government more efficient or responsive to public needs. All it will do is to make the contractors more compliant to the wishes of those holding the reins of power at the time, which will likely amplify any peaks and valleys rather than help calm them down and to keep things working regardless of political leadership.",Hrmbee,2025-04-28T09:22:15,18

"Federal employee here. This is a proposed rule. Before the rule becomes final, there is a period where the government has to solicit comments from the public. Those comments are supposed to be considered by the government and shape the final rule. If you want to help us keep fighting this regime, we need you to submit comments on this rule.  Here’s some info on submitting an effective public comment:   https://www.cogr.edu/sites/default/files/Tips_For_Submitting_Effective_Comments.pdf  https://www.regulations.gov/assets/files/Public-Comment-on-Federal-Regulations_Final.pdf  While submitting ‘fuck trump’ as a public comment is cathartic, you have the opportunity to have a greater impact and help us feds out if your comment thoughtfully identifies problems/impacts of the rule. Public comments have to be reviewed and addressed in the final rule. If the government fails to adequately address concerns raised in public comments, that can help support future legal challenges to the rule. Thanks!",YoullHaveToFireMe,2025-04-28T17:49:10,7
