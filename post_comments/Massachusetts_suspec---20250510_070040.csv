"This entire story is horrific tale of online radicalization. They got disowned by their family after transitioning, then their fiance(e?) committee suicide literally on election night because Trump won. Saw communists inciting people after the United Healthcare CEO was assassinated, and that was the final straw to ""do something.""  Completely brainwashed by left-wing propaganda online. The note left behind mentioned ""Nazis killing my \[t\] sisters"", just total fake news bullshit. Likely they blamed the suicide on Trump and not hysterical fearmongering about him by the left.  It is interesting that they chose to turn themselves into authorities before going through with it, though.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-10T12:06:36,7
