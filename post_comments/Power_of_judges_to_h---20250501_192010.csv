Never before has a country shifted to dictatorship in such clear and well documented public view  I can’t wait for all the crying of “I was just following orders” when this all over,JelloBelter,2025-05-01T19:42:56,45
Sounds like taxation without representation to me.,Mr_Horsejr,2025-05-01T19:28:59,19
"> Notably the language is retroactive, so if it became law, it would hamstring a court’s ability to hold the administration in contempt for defying a court order issued before the bill was enacted if the judge had denied bond.  Notable indeed. It’s yet another slice to help democracy bleed out faster, with more to come I’m sure.",downhereforyoursoul,2025-05-01T20:25:25,11
"Please read the whole article if possible as the headline doesn't tell the full story.  Update!  Bits from article:  he ability of federal judges to hold the Trump administration in contempt for defying their orders could be undermined by legislation approved by a House Republican-led committee late Wednesday in a bill that may be impossible for Senate Democrats to filibuster.  Republicans say that the provision is aimed at discouraging frivolous lawsuits. Democrats and the administration’s legal opponents charge that GOP lawmakers are seeking to give President Donald Trump the green light to engage in illegal conduct that had been prohibited by courts.  “Instead of providing support for the judicial branch, this Judiciary Committee bill seeks to strip to strip the courts of their power to hold the administration in contempt when the President violates court orders,” Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, said before Wednesday’s vote.  The legislation comes amid a multi-front campaign by Trump and his allies to attack the legal institutions that are serving as a check on his aggressive use of presidential power. That has included smearing judges who have ruled against his policies and issuing executive orders targeting law firms that represent his political foes. The Justice Department has also at times resisted providing courts with information relevant to the disputes before them.  The House proposal would defund the enforcement of contempt orders if the judge had previously not ordered the plaintiffs in the case to put up a security bond with a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order granted in their favor – essentially making it more expensive to challenge administrative policies.  Notably the language is retroactive, so if it became law, it would hamstring a court’s ability to hold the administration in contempt for defying a court order issued before the bill was enacted if the judge had denied bond.  The Trump administration has already faced the possibility of contempt proceedings for allegedly not complying with an order from Judge James Boasberg that sought to halt the deportation of certain migrants.  Procedural and legal hurdles:  There are several more legislative steps before the proposal becomes law as well as procedural and legal hurdles.  It’s unclear whether the provision complies with the Senate rules that limit what lawmakers can pass via the reconciliation process. The Judiciary Committee was voting on a package of provisions Wednesday that would be its offering for the larger House reconciliation bill. But the provision could be stripped out during its journey to the Senate or when it’s in the upper chamber.  There are also questions about its constitutionality and whether Congress unlawfully is stripping an inherent authority of the judiciary, according to Weissman.  The committee voted down an amendment offered by Democrats that would have removed the provision from the larger reconciliation package the committee was considering.  “MAGA Republicans are trying to use this spending bill to keep Americans from using the courts to constrain Trump’s illegal actions,” said Georgia Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson. “They’re saying that, unless you hand over a lot of money when Trump and his administration violate your rights, they can just keep on violating them.”",Anoth3rDude,2025-05-01T19:20:35,11

"Treason, this is Treason. Trump said we should bring back a certain kind of justice for traitors. I agree 100%. Everyone who votes for this, and every other enabling bill is part of this coup.
