"James can shut the fuck up. She has no leg to stand on considering the fact that her office is in the middle of YET ANOTHER CONTROVERSY, but THIS TIME with the boys at Unsub! All she cares about is getting Trump, NOT the boys and girls in buffalo’s schools getting sexually assaulted and being DEATHLY close to getting kidnapped.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-05T06:51:44,52
"Technically, she is right. The Trump administration IS threatening her way of life. Grift, racism, nepotism, and failing upwards. Unfortunately, not /s",flylink63,2025-05-05T08:38:26,35
Gonna sue to keep their criminal racketeering going.  Don’t touch their cash!,j3remy2007,2025-05-05T06:36:18,60
And this is how democracies collapse. In an ocean of lawfare. Nothing is being done. Nothing changes. All is fine until the left figures out how to use the court system to destroy the country. This pattern is repeated everywhere in the west. And in Europe things are even worse than America. Courts have stopped some vital projects and megaprojects with power that they should have never gotten.,dankhorse25,2025-05-05T07:22:51,26

I hope she goes to prison for a long long time.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-05T08:27:23,12
"Well, when your way of life is both morally and legally wrong, I see no problem with threatening it.  Authorities who don't threaten the way of life of those who do wrong, particularly those who knowingly do wrong, aren't deserving of their authority.  After all, we don't entrust authority to people just so they can sit back and let the corrupt and unjust continue to be corrupt and unjust.  Sooo... In short... Good job, Mr President, at doing your job if they feel you're threatening them.",Shadeylark,2025-05-05T09:01:29,8
