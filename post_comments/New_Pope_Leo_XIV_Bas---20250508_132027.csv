"To give more context: *ordo amoris* is a term that appears in St Augustine's writings once, and he doesn't use it at all to mean ""love your family, then your community, then your neighbors"" at all; rather he just uses it to say that the love of God should be the center of the believer's love towards His creation, ors something along those lines. St Thomas Aquinas expanded on the idea with his *ordo caritatis* which can be interpreted as ""you should not love the stranger so much that you neglect loving your family, and more importantly you should love God/Jesus first"" (I'm far from a theologian but that's what I gathered when I researched the question).¬†   Despite what some ""opinionated"" websites might say, it is not at all a big guiding principle of Catholicism or anything like that. It definitely ranks orders of magnitude behind the big hitters like ""love thy neighbor""\* or the Good Samaritan parable, which unlike this *ordo amoris* are very clear in their lessons: you gotta care about everyone, even if they're strangers, even if you don't like them personally, even if they're smelly.   All that to say, in this as in so many other things, Vance is wrong and weird.   \*the use of ""neighbor"" in the Bible is interesting because in some other languages (e.g. French and German) the wording is more ""love the person who is next, the person coming after you"". The concept of ""neighbor"" is *temporal* rather than spatial, and to me that very much removes this idea of ""you should care for the people next to you first"" and instead communicates the idea of caring for people who will be going through the same things as you soon, regardless of who or where they are.",ShatnersChestHair,2025-05-08T15:06:41,69

They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. ‚ÄòLook after him,‚Äô he said, ‚Äòand when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.‚Äô  36 ‚ÄúWhich of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?‚Äù  37 The expert in the law replied, ‚ÄúThe one who had mercy on him.‚Äù  **Jesus told him, ‚ÄúGo and do likewise.‚Äù**",crazyprsn,2025-05-08T15:55:06,3

"The Bible really isn't inconsistent.   The central teachings are the Gospels--Jesus's actual story and lessons. He had a very clear lens on morality that focused on the marginalized.   The Old Testament gives context for Jesus's religious roots, but are not necessarily intended to be used as lessons in their own right.  The New Testament is mostly commentary on the Gospels, written by various apostles, and usually targeting small Christian cults around Anatolia and Greece to give advice to those communities on growing the Church and on Jesus's teachings. As these books are always tailored to cater to specific communities, they should ALWAYS be read with that lens in mind.   The real problem is that people take the historical context and the commentary and weigh them the same as the thing the Bible actually cares about--the Gospels. Jesus's whole purpose was to found a new church and forge a new covenant, so it makes literally no sense to cite the Old Testament against Jesus's teachings as I often see fundies do. And as I said, with the New Testament, you should always keep in mind who the intended audience was in their commentary.

"I think the moral is his self sacrificing nature is what saved him. He was hospitable, and treated his guests with extreme hospitality. It's probable that they'd have killed him for anything less.  It's a parable in my mind. He treated the guests, people he didn't know, and foreigners, better than himself and his family. And therefore he was treated well in return.  He also did try to bar the door iirc, but the people broke in, and would have killed them or worse if the disguised angels present didn't blind them all  I've also heard it talked about by some scholars that it was a domination thing. The people wanted to show the newcomers their place, beneath them, and it was just played up to horrific levels. Lot was displaying humility at the same time as hospitality. This then echoes Jesus sending the apostles out to find worthy people that let them stay with them on their journeys  But no as a kid this didn't make sense to me either.

"> Wait, why does it have to end with raping?  This is like hearing the story of the 3 little pigs and then arguing that the fluid dynamics needed to blow down houses of straws or sticks would be too much for a wolf to blow. This misses the point. The story, like the 3 little pigs, is meant to be allegorical and one could argue obviously so just like the 3 little pigs.   The Torah was assembled in the post-exile to Babylon times. It probably contained stories from both Jewish (though they wouldn't necessarily have identified as that at the time) kingdoms: Israel and Judea. This is actually quite obvious as there are two origin stores for the Jewish people; one coming from Egypt and the other from Babylon.   The Bible was assembled by Eastern Roman theologians that excluded various texts and writings because they just didn't fit with the world view. Most well known were gnostic texts or teachings. As a note the 'Gnostics' would not have identified as such as they saw their beliefs as true.   Fundamentally, a reasonable secular reader comes to the conclusion that all of these stories were allegorical and intended by some priestly class to teach some sort of lesson to normal people that the priests thought would make those normal people better people. Assigning literal-ness post-facto would be like reading Hansel and Gretel and then trying to find the witch's house made of candy somewhere in Germany.   Or one takes a non-secular view and sees basically a master plan by a literal god to do something that also somehow always aligns with their own world view and putting their people (whoever they may be) at center stage for some grand historical-theological story (spoiler: no, you are a thinking machine made of star stuff that is also self replicating, if that isn't enough for you then I really can't help you).",PuffyPanda200,2025-05-09T07:27:32,1

"Plus the entire conecpt of race and ethnicity was just wildly different in antiquity. As in, the whole concept as we understand it just did not exist, and would not exist for over 1000 years. That is not to say that they did not have equally arbitrary divisions between people, but it is weird when people try to use it to justify modern (post 1600s) conceptions of ethnicity.  There is this burgeoning drama I saw between a professor on youtube and a bunch of people who are angry at him for saying that Rome was not a ""European"" empire. They are fixated on the fact that Rome, the capital, is located in what we now call Europe, but that distinction is completely arbitrary. They did not divide their empire up that way, and the people to the north were more foreign to them then the people in the African parts of the empire.  It seems to be really difficult for people to conceptualize a pre-colonialism idea of identity. So they see groups of people from different areas as being different in a way that ancient people would not have thought of. They were much more concerned with maintaining the integrity of their kingdoms and the influence of their geographically local deities. Normal people could just wander around, there were no border patrols. As long as you knew the language there was not much stopping people from just going places.  They rarely went far, obviously, but that was more of a problem of capacity rather than any sort of restriction on movement.

It is different for other demonimations. Most Catholics I knew, for example, did not care.¬†   The actual problem is much, much, much more insidious. As an Evangelical the way you are taught the Bible basically kills your ability to critically think about it. It is always in reading plans, guided devotionals, alongside the pastors sermons, with accompanying commentary, or focused heavily on certain passages to guide interpretations of others.   The trick they have is that they prime you so completely to adopt a certain interpretation, preventing critical analysis or thinking, which makes it so you cannot understand the books despite reading them often.

"Technically it has only been a few times at most. The translations are usually Hebrew -> Greek -> English, Greek -> English, or Hebrew -> English.   Most translation is done from a collections and recreations of the oldest documents we have access to, and so there is only a single leap into whatever language you are directly translating into, as those old copies are in their original language or are only a single language removed.¬†   That is not to say that many changes were not made over time, because there have been. They were just down within the original languages prior to the copies we have.   As an example, which I mentioned somewhere else in this thread in less detail, this is a plausible explanation of how we got the first bit of Genesis:   Originally there were likely 3 different creation stories. Genesis 1, Genesis 2 and then everyone with Cain and Abel. These three things would have been oral traditions. At some point, all three were written down, probably separately. They were collected, and when it came to be time to copy them, they were all copied into the same scroll. Later, when it needed to be copied again, the editor thought they were all the same story, and so made minor changes to harmonize them and make them flow. So there stories, from different times and traditions, became one story.   That explains all the weird bits.¬†   The same thing happened with Joseph being sold into slavery. There were almost certainly two stories that got folded into one by interlacing their sentences for some reason. You can actually split that one apart now and get two complete stories that make way more sense than the combined version.   Anyway, tldr is that the errors are generally from transcription, redaction, addition and editing rather than translation.

"Exactly right. They treat the biblical texts with an almost comical level of disrespect in order to *force* them to mean what they want them to mean.

In a way it is kind of true that they are not reading the Bible in a metaphorical sense, as they are reading their own opinions superimposed over the top of it. Like the comic book inside the math text book trick.¬† But I think it is important to be accurate with this as a lot of people will just adopt the cliche and misunderstand how deep the indoctrination actually goes. If people assume that all they need to do to counter the ideology is show them verses that contradict it, believing that they must not know those verses, then they will be unprepared for the avalanche of cognitive dissonance that will explode out of the person they are talking to.¬†",Caelinus,2025-05-08T18:32:08,1

"I always hated this.  Had a relative talk about how he purchased a gun because he had to drive through Cincinnati while coming to visit.  I was like, WTF for man.  He said, you know how those blacks are.  He did not use the word black there though.  Then got pissed.  Later mentioning rapes by them.  I mentioned how another relative was raped by a white guy.  Should we label all white guys?  That really pissed him off.  He is the one that later told me people like myself should be shot and killed for supporting Biden and giving this country away.     They also call themselves Christian.  Some go to catholic churches and that is their denomination.  But they never follow the teachings.  It is not surprising though when you hear some of it.

"I was referencing a specific sect of Catholicism, Opus Dei, that flourished during the Spanish Franco and Chilean Pinochet regimes. Gareth Gore's book ""Opus: The Cult of Dark Money, Human Trafficking, and Right-Wing Conspiracy inside the Catholic Church‚Äù is excellent. Summary from freedom from religion:   **A thrilling expos√© recounting how members of Opus Dei‚Äîa secretive, ultra-conservative Catholic sect‚Äîpushed its radical agenda within the Church and around the globe, using billions of dollars siphoned from one of the world‚Äôs largest banks.**  For over half a century, Banco Popular was one of the most profitable banks in the world‚Äîuntil one day, in 2017, when the Spanish bank suddenly collapsed overnight. When investigative journalist Gareth Gore was dispatched to report on the story, he expected to find yet another case of unbridled capitalist ambition gone wrong. Instead, he uncovered decades of deception that hid one of the most brazen cases of corporate pillaging in history, perpetrated by a group of men sworn to celibacy and self-flagellation who had secretly controlled Popular and abused their positions there to help spread Opus Dei to every corner of the world.  Drawing on unparalleled access to bank records, insider accounts, and exclusive interviews with whistle-blowers from within Opus Dei, Gore reveals how money from the bank was used to lure unsuspecting recruits‚Äîsome of them only children‚Äîinto a life of servitude. He also tracks the ascent of Opus Dei within the United States, exposing its role in bankrolling many right-wing causes, including the Supreme Court‚Äôs overturning of¬†*Roe v. Wade*. \[look up Leonard Leo (Trump‚Äôs ‚Äújudge whisperer‚Äù) of the federalist society and Teneo Network for more on that scope.\]",Huge_Excitement4465,2025-05-09T07:44:20,3

Also, those laws never applied to the majority of people in the first place and were for specific tribles of Israel and not Gentiles.   It‚Äôs a common misunderstanding, but in Matthew 5:17-18, Jesus says he came to fulfill the Law,  not to keep it all going unchanged forever. The word ‚Äúfulfill‚Äù (Greek: plƒìro≈ç) means to complete or bring to its full meaning, not to perpetuate every civil and ceremonial regulation.  The laws given in the Old Testament were part of a covenant with Israel, not universal for all people, and not permanent. Even in the New Testament, this is made clear. Gentiles were never under those laws to begin with, and after Christ's fulfillment, believers are under a new covenant.

Stated that the divine did not wish Attila to do so and that he should exercise restraint lest the divine judge him and he being of a more open religious perspective. That is the pagan sorts were. Probably agreed with the assessment and left.  Considering he started the war over no tribute being paid vs the Eastern Roman Empire who record that tribute was payed and everyone knows it and we know when the west paid off barbarians before. The answer is that the reason people talk of Leo using miracles and so forth is because of the disease ravaging his force and the answer is the military winds just didn't favor him because he would have been stuck in a very urbanized, very mountainous place while the Eastern Roman Empire was mobilizing against him in the Danube and was likely to align with the Western Army if Attila took to long and box him in in italy.

"I wasn‚Äôt too familiar with the Leos, but I do know that popes tend to pick a papal name that indicates which popes in history they favor policy and personality wise. Like, in general, you can assume that if a pope picks a name that‚Äôs been previously used it generally means they want to continue that pope‚Äôs rough policies.   With that in mind the Leos are pretty wild. Leo the Great who challenged Rome and held the church together while the Roman Empire was in decline. Leo 9 who led the papal army himself, was instrumental in the Great Schism which split the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches and was one of the most important Medieval popes, and then Leo 13, who the newest Leo likely chose his name for, who was a staunch supporter of the poor and working classes, a union supporter, who promoted workers rights, and while he criticized communism he also strongly condemned laissez faire capitalism too.   That‚Äôs a really bold choice of a name. Assuming here that Robert is aligning himself with these great Leos he sees himself as the kind of leader who‚Äôs going to go toe to toe with global powers in support of the poor and working classes while working on keeping the church together.

"Even John did not have a high christology either. His version of Jesus's divinity was more akin to an emobodied idol (as in Jesus is a divine proxy acting as God) or a demigod.¬†   Part of the problem we have in interpreting it is that we are on the other side of a radical shift in the basic assumptions of theism. Monotheism as we understand it was not really a thing at the time, and their system of beleif was more akin to what we would call ""Monolatry."" Many Gods, but only one of them was the best God.¬†   But that has some radical implications for how we view the nature of Jesus, as most of the trinitarian stuff comes *after* the text is written by reinterpreting normal superlative adoration of the deity as being expressions saying that the deity was the only deity in existence. Once you make that shift, Jesus must become God in a literal sense or you are suddenly a polytheist.¬†   But if you toss off the assumption that the Bible only references a single divine being (it factual references a lot of them but all those verses are reinterpreted) then everything said about Jesus in John and later makes WAY more sense and you do not even have to invent any extrabiblical hypostatic union nonsense.",Caelinus,2025-05-08T18:40:48,1
"You‚Äôre mistaking literary layering for contradiction. The presence of parallel accounts, multiple voices, or overlapping traditions doesn‚Äôt negate structural unity. It reveals it.  The Joseph story isn‚Äôt a mess. It‚Äôs a woven form. It reflects Hebrew narrative technique, chiastic structure, mirrored layers, typological echoes. You‚Äôre seeing editorial seams and calling them fractures. But seams are necessary in any embodied form.  The Gospels vary not because they program Jesus differently, but because they refract the same ontological event through different lenses. Matthew shows fulfillment. Mark shows action. Luke shows inclusion. John shows essence.  These are not contradictions. They are multi-angled witness, which is exactly what you‚Äôd expect if something infinite entered finite form. The variation proves authenticity. No real event compresses into one flat account.  You cite ‚Äúoriginal languages‚Äù but miss how Hebrew and Greek operate differently from modern Western reductionism. Semitic narrative holds both/and tension on purpose. It was never trying to satisfy Enlightenment-era criteria of harmony. You want a Western textbook. The Bible gives you an icon layered, veiled, structural.  So no. I‚Äôve read it structurally. What you‚Äôre calling contradiction is actually ontological plural form, a hallmark of divinely inspired witness. If you expected symmetry, you‚Äôll call it chaos.

"It's really much simpler than that and i think you're overcomplicating it.

Atheism = Based on available information, i don't believe there's any factual proof of god. Therefore i choose not to believe.   Agnostics can choose to believe or not believe in god but still retain the stance that they accept they can be wrong.  As an Agnostic myself, it really is that simple. It's just accepting that the answer is unknowable one way or the other so we don't try to claim one way or the other.  Whether you believe in god or in the big bang, you have to accept ""something"" be it god or matter, just always existed in order to create the universe when it did. And then that leads to how matter or god just ""always"" existed then and how they began. Which is beyond our comprehension. Thus it's unknowable whether god truly exists or not.  That's all Agnostics accept. That the answer is unknowable so we simply accept that regardless and simply choose to believe or not believe of our own volition while accepting we could be wrong.  Theism and Atheism are typically more adamant in their belief that the god exists or that logic and science make god impractical.",ikarikh,2025-05-08T15:04:32,5

"You are confirming exactly the lens I identified. You treat layered narrative as failed editing because you assume ancient writers aimed at the same linear coherence you expect. That is a modern bias.  Being a Biblical Hebrew major gives you linguistic tools but does not settle the hermeneutical question. The Church Fathers, Jewish sages, and even modern scholars outside materialist frameworks recognize purposeful duality, not accidental contradiction.  Of course Genesis reflects oral tradition. That was the point. Genesis weaves multiple voices into a single icon of truth through multiplicity. The presence of differing details forces the reader into contemplation, not dismissal. That is deliberate ancient literary technique, not clumsy patchwork.  You accuse apologists of starting from the endpoint. Yes. The endpoint is Christ, the Logos, the fulfillment of Scripture. Without that ontological key, the text collapses into fragments. With it, the fragments reveal a unified form that transcends surface inconsistencies.  You are reading for collapse. I am reading for consummation. That is the real difference.",Key-Item8266,2025-05-08T23:55:20,1

"One of the links I sent literally says he housed a priest that was accused of rape back in 1991. Knowing full-well that the guy committed the rape, in 2000 Prevost let him stay on church property located near an elementary school.   ‚ÄúAccording to diocesan records reviewed by The Pillar, Ray had been restricted in ministry for nine years by 2000, and had been accused multiple times of sexually abusing boys, at least one of them for years. He had admitted to bringing at least one boy to sleep in his rectory bed, but said of one allegation that he ‚Äúdid not recall‚Äù having sexually assaulted a child with whom he admitted to having ‚Äúcuddled.‚Äù Ray did admit to diocesan officials that in 1993 he engaged in sexual activity with a man while on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje, a supposed Marian apparition site in Croatia.   A July 2000 memo from a Chicago archdiocesan official indicates that the Augustinians at the friary said they would permit Ray to rent rooms in the building after they received permission from their provincial superior, Prevost. Ray actually moved in two months later.  The friary was the second choice of a residence for Ray, who was required to move in 2000 because of the pending sale of the diocesan property where he had been living under supervision. The first rectory proposed for his residence was rejected by the archdiocesan review board because it was on the same property as a parish school.  Archdiocesan records say the Augustinian residence was considered suitable for Ray because ‚Äúthere is no school in the immediate area.‚Äù  PREVOST KNEW THIS PRIEST WAS A RAPIST AND STILL SUPPORTED/HOUSED HIM.

"Camp near Sharpsburg October the 14th, 1862  My Dearest Sarah,  It is with a trembling hand and heavy heart that I put pen to paper this day, for I must relay to you grievous news. By the grace of our Lord I yet draw breath, but I have suffered a wound most grave in service to the Union cause.  Whilst advancing upon the enemy line last Tuesday past, I was struck by a lead ball, cruelly and without warning, in the most delicate region of my person. The pain was searing and immediate, like the wrath of Providence itself, and I was soon taken to the field hospital where the surgeons did their grim work.  It was there, amidst the cries of the wounded and the stink of ether, that a kindly but determined medic‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîwas forced to amputate my left testicle. He told me plainly there was no other recourse, lest I lose more than the Lord intended. I did not cry out, Sarah, though my soul wept for the loss of my God-given orb.  You will be glad to know that I yet retain my right, and the doctors assure me that, with proper rest and prayer, I shall still be able to fulfill my husbandly duties, should God see fit to return me to your loving arms.  Though I grieve the loss, I reckon it a fair price for my brothers-in-arms, and for the Union. As I lay upon the bloodied cot, I thought only of you, and how sweet your voice would be if I could but hear it again.  The boys in the company have taken to calling me ""Ol' One Shot Johnny,"" and though I laugh with them, inside I know I have sacrificed something dear. But fear not, my love, for I remain your devoted husband in spirit and in strength‚Äîalbeit half-equipped.  And now, as I close this letter, I must confess, I have seen things on this battlefield‚Ä¶ things that would chill the blood of even the fiercest rebel. Sarah, I swear before God himself, I thought I might see the Undertaker throw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummet 16 ft through an announcer's table.

"The idea that ""maybe we'll figure it out eventually"" is a moot point though. Because Atheism, Theism and Agnosticism is based on our current understanding of the world. Of which, we currently are not able to comprehend how time, matter or god just ""exist"" with no origin. And we don't have a way to definitively prove god's existence or lack thereof. Only Science that FAVORS a lack thereof but can't outright prove it.  If we got definitive proof of whether god exists or not, there would no longer be a need for atheism, agmosticsm, theism etc because we'd have our answer and would all be forced to accept one way or the other.  Since we DON'T have a definitive answer, we have Agnosticism.  Lastly, you said ""This is literaly athetism. If you don't believe in god/deities....""   That's not what i said. Accepting the answer is unknowable =/= lack of a belief in god nor does it mean a belief in god. It simply means just that, the ANSWER is unknowable.  You can be an Agnostic and still believe in god. Being Agnostic does NOT mean you don't believe in god.   It's really as simple as:  Theist - Believes their is a god and has faith it's true  Atheist - Does not believe in god and feels science backs that up  Agnostic - Believes it's impossible to say one way or the other. May or may not believe in god but accepts they may be wrong if they do/don't.   I don't understand why you're making it a bigger thing.   I'm Agnostic myself and CHOOSE to believe in god for my own personal reasons. I'm anti-religion but pro-god. But i accept that despite my choice to believe in him, he may not exist and i really don't know for sure what will happen when i die.  Agnosticism =/= atheism  In simpler terms, Atheism and Theism are black and white beliefs while Agnosticism is Gray. Theism of any kind involves taking a firm stance for or against god. Agnosticsm stays in the middle saying basically ""Hey i'm not really sure"" and doesn't take a firm stance one way or the other.",ikarikh,2025-05-08T16:44:34,1

It's so fucking wishy washy, say what you mean and don't dance around it.  But if you are going to look into his past, you should contextualize that the vast majority of Catholics (which his family were) were at odds with the Nazi party, and by all accounts he was an unwilling and delinquent member of the org he was conscripted into.

"I do not assume disunity as a default. The evidence is for disunity. There is no evidence for ""layered meaning"" whatever the hell that is supposed to mean.

But if all of that was true, and the bible is crazy science fiction for 2 paragraphs, then surely a God could have expressed it better then by just mixing two random oral traditions together poorly.   Here is another question: Who killed Goliath? Because the Bible says it was both Elhanan and David. With David being the *later* telling, with an aditional even later mention that added an addendum to try and rectify it by adding ""brother of"" to Goliath in manscripts *after* a certain time period, with the earlier ones just saying ""Goliath.""  What mystery are we supposed to learn from that? That the people who kept that book of the Bible were willing to alter it in order to lie to make it seem more consistent then it was? Because that is the truth.  I mean, there are a lot of these. So either God is a liar, or he had no control over the text.   To reiterate: I was a religious fundamentalist. I assumed perfect unity and attested as such. I attended Bible College, majored in Biblical Theology and Biblical Hebrew and minored in Greek. The reason I realized the bible was not unified or univocal was because I studied it *under the assumption* that it was both, and found that the bible falsified my assumptions.

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Therefore, even doctrine that is not explicitly mentioned in the Bible is a part of Jesus' teachings, so long as they originate from the Church that Peter founded.

"I think we're misunderstanding one another here.  Atheism is a lack of belief in god. By saying you're not convinced, you're taking a firm stance in saying until proven otherwise, you don't believe in god.   You're correct that Agnosticsm still requires theism or atheism, i'm not disputing that. I never did. As i mentioned repeatedly that an Agnostic may believe in god or not believe. As many feel agnostic is a form if atheism, when it's not.  Only that the ""middle ground"" / ""gray"" part stems from Agnostics even in their theism or atheism, accepting they really don't know if they're right or wrong despite their choice to believe or not believe. That the answer is unknowable and they are simply going with what they feel in their gut if they choose to believe or not believe.  I'm not sure how to explain that any better.  I understand what you're saying and I agree with the overall message you're trying to convey.   Just as someone who is Agnostic and believes in god but fully accepts he may not exist and science favors him not existing, i think that's the important detail that a lot of people don't understand.  Despite my choice to believe in god due to personal experiences and reasonings which i have a strong belief in, i accept that in spite of those reasons, it's likely he doesn't exist and when i die, most likely it'll be like anything else, i just stop existing. No grand scheme, no answers, no happy ending etc.  It's a reality i prepare for despite my belief in god and hope for more.  And that's where the ""gray"" area comes from. You kinda live in both worlds.  I accept that it's impossible for me to know and i simply need to accept both possibilities as possible regardless of my personal choice.   A solely theist or atheist can have a similiar experience with pondering it all, but they tend to ultimately strongly favor their choice and expect it as the end result.

"You‚Äôre citing a real textual issue, but it‚Äôs not the wrecking ball you think.    1.

Early manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls show the tension existed early. Later scribes harmonized, which was normal in ancient cultures. They saw it as preserving truth, not deception.  2. Does this mean God lost control of the text?  No. Catholics do not believe God dictated the Bible word for word. The Church teaches Scripture is free from error in what God willed to reveal for our salvation. Minor historical or scribal differences do not break that.  3. Why would God allow this?  Because Scripture is meant for encounter, not perfect legal precision. It forces the reader to wrestle with it. God works through human history, not outside of it.  4. You rejected fundamentalism  Fair. So does the Catholic Church. But you‚Äôve mistaken that for the Church‚Äôs view.

"...the fuck are you even talking about?  Materialism has a well known definition that genuinely *doesn't* have anything to do with the definitions of theism, atheism or agnosticism.   And bringing it into the conversation *will* confuse matters because there's literally entire branches of theology; christian included; that would consider themselves to be materialist.   Being a materialist doesn't say anything about whether you believe there is a god or not. Being a materialist isn't incompatible with believing there is a god.   Appealing to ""well popular usage"" is just repeating the same problem that led to this thread of messages in the first place: the popular (to some) usage of 'agnostic' and 'atheist' are *incorrect* usage of the terms. And the popular usage of 'materialist' is *insufficient* to address the issue of whether one believes in a god or not.   You'd just be replacing 'atheist' or 'theism'; terms which *actually* answer the question of whether one believes in a god; with 'materialist', which *does not*, on the basis that you think its popular usage implies a belief in a science based universe that does not allow for a god to exist? That's just complicating things when you have a perfectly working and simple word to use already.",nybbleth,2025-05-09T03:25:33,1
"> Atheism is a lack of belief in god. By saying you're not convinced, you're taking a firm stance in saying until proven otherwise, you don't believe in god.   I disagree. It can be a firm stance but that is not universal or required. You're simply unconvinced, which isn't a stance on its own.  > Only that the ""middle ground"" / ""gray"" part stems from Agnostics even in their theism or atheism, accepting they really don't know if they're right or wrong despite their choice to believe or not believe.  Belief is not a choice but something that happens to you. One can choose to pretend to believe but one cannot choose to believe. Nor to not believe. Accepting that one doesn't know something is always a good idea, independent of religion.  The way I see it, theism and atheism are absolute positions, while agnosticism is relative to a proposed god concept. One can be agnostic about one proposed god concept and gnostic (or non-agnostic if you prefer) about another.   So in my view it doesn't even make sense to say ""I'm an Agnostic."". One can say ""I'm agnostic towards this specific god."" and for a different god one can say ""I'm certain this god cannot exist."". There are too many different god concepts to have a universal agnostic position towards all. Some are obviously false.",burning_iceman,2025-05-08T19:29:31,1
"You flatter me, but being a good person requires more than just trying to be kind. Sometimes, that includes courage. Not already being an ally was cowardly. I realized in that moment both how harmful my behavior really was, how pointless it was as a futile attempt to be accepted by bigots, and that gay friends (or even *no* friends) would be better than a bunch of assholes who didn't act much like friends at all. I think the best part was what happened next. I was in a room mostly full of people who hated me, and I thought nearly all of them were homophobes, but nearly 2/3 applauded me. They actually literally got up and clapped, but one told me not to push my luck when I tried to say more. I noticed a little less homophobia in the school after that, and a lot more confidence in that other person. Now that I think about it, that's not who I said it to. I called the boy who most often called me gay ""gay"", and this other person was sick of all the casual homophobia and crossed the room to get right up in my face and complain. I briefly overcame my social anxiety to give that speech, but the person who provoked it was the brave one, especially considering that I was surrounded by fash where I was sitting.  Edit: I joined the sub just to upvote you. I never did before because I'm not American. It feels wrong.

"Well bt that notion you can do the same for theism in saying you believe in the christian god but don't believe in other deities.  For me, being Agnostic is an important distinction. Because i'm anti-religion but pro god. While also believing i don't really know if i'm right or not in believing in god. And it's actually something i think about a lot.  So simply saying ""I believe in god"" is VERY misrepresentative of my beliefs as it implies a ton of things that simply aren't true about me.  Wheras stating ""I'm Agnostic but choose to believe in god"" is a far better simplified descriptor for my beliefs in its simplest form and doesn't hold all the implications of being a christian or a devout that simply saying ""I believe in god"" does.  And that's where the original gray area distinction came from. That when it comes to your belief or non-belief in god, the agnostic distinction matters. Because it's more complicated than solely believing or not believing.  It's kinda why labels in general exist. Because we as humans like to put each other in boxes we can easily understand.  If you just force everyone into ""Believes in God"" and ""Doesn't believe in God"" as the only acceptable responses, it forces a lot of implications on both. Wheras Agnosticism shows a different logical thought process when it comes to the concept of god.   If you tell someone you're an atheist, immediately you're put in a box of no belief in god. Wheras if you state you're an Agnostic Atheist, you are seen as not believing in god but open to the possibility.   Thus the black/white/gray comparison.",ikarikh,2025-05-08T20:47:50,1

"Actually, I never argued the Bible is univocal in the modern sense. **Quite the opposite.** I explicitly acknowledged tension, development, and scribal variation.

"When did I say that it being inconsistent was evidence that it could not be divinely inspired? It only means that it cannot be inerrant.

But if your theology is built on the basis of univocality and inerrancy, as US Christian Fundamentalist do (the exact group I was talking about, as I was talking about my personal experience) then that theology *does* collapse upon examining the Bible.

"Thanks for the clarification, and I see more clearly what you‚Äôre trying to say now.  Just to be precise, I never claimed the Bible is inerrant in the modern, fundamentalist sense. I‚Äôm Catholic, not a fundamentalist. The Catholic Church‚Äôs position is that Scripture is inerrant in what God willed to reveal for our salvation, not in every historical, scientific, or textual detail. That means human fingerprints, including tensions, developments, and even contradictions, are expected in the text.  So if your critique is aimed at the fundamentalist doctrine of strict inerrancy and uniformity, I actually agree with you. That framework can‚Äôt survive close reading of Scripture. But I‚Äôm not defending that view.  What I am saying is that recognizing contradiction or textual complexity does not disprove divine inspiration unless your definition of inspiration requires mechanical perfection. And again, the Catholic tradition has never taught that. It teaches that God speaks through human authors, not by overriding them.  When I said earlier that your argument seemed to imply collapse, it was in response to your language about ‚Äúthrowing out a bunch of it‚Äù and ‚Äúforcing an interpretation.‚Äù That sounded like the implication was the Bible is unusable unless warped. But if you‚Äôre just saying interpretation is always shaped by a framework, yes, that‚Äôs true of all texts, sacred or secular.  So if your point is ‚Äúfundamentalism doesn‚Äôt work,‚Äù agreed. But if your broader claim is ‚Äúthe Bible is necessarily incoherent unless imposed upon,‚Äù I‚Äôd push back. Interpretation can be faithful, not just imposed. Especially if the unity is Christological, not literalistic.  In short, I think we were aiming at different targets.
