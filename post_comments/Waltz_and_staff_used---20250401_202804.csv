How incompetent and careless can this administration be? It just shows they could careless if Putin or others get access to our intelligence information,Economy_Swim_8585,2025-04-01T20:30:11,6

"Gmail? Signal might make sense, but Google admits they snoop on Gmail for advertising purposes.   What ads do you get when you discuss bombing someone?",Animats,2025-04-02T00:59:00,1

They used out of government messaging sources the first administration so why is anyone surprised,tinacat933,2025-04-02T09:54:52,1
"I feel like this really does show how lax our elected officials get, on both sides.   Back to the Hilary emails days, I, even as the leftest, was one who was critical of that. Not to the point the right was, but in general, our elected officials on both sides need to stop being so lazy with their communications. They need to take security risks seriously. I'm sure many of them get too comfortable with their communications. They wanted the position of power in the government,  and they need to take it seriously. I've seen people in other industries that don't deal with governmental issues get fired because they used Gmail. I had a friend fired from an well-knownn cosmetic company because she didn't use her VPN for a couple of  weeks when the box was broken.   If corporations take their security seriously,  the US government should be taking it even more seriously.",Bookshelfhelp,2025-04-01T20:56:04,0
