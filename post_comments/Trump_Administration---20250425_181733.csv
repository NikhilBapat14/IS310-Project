"Despite this positive development, Kurlan clarified that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) still retains the authority to terminate student records for other legal reasons. These include violations of visa terms or involvement in activities deemed contrary to U.S. interests.  You can and still be deported if you violate US law, don’t kid yourself.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T18:54:49,49
The liberal press downplays this insanely. I read a CNN article that says that people are being deported for “minor violations such as shoplifting.”  If you’re a foreign student on a visa and get arrested for shoplifting you should be sent back. WHAT KIND OF FUCKED UP STANDARDS DO WE HAVE?,cofcof420,2025-04-26T09:21:49,14
"I don't get why anyone is defending people like Mahmoud Khalil. These people are member of organizations that consider the 7 October attack by Hamas to be a military and political victory. If I had filled that out in my visa application during the Biden administration I would've gotten rejected as per Immigration and National Act section 212(a)(3)(b) and rightfully so. That's not about free speech, that's about not inviting terrorists into your home.",The_Asian_Viper,2025-04-25T23:00:59,14
"Agreed. Hopefully foreign students don’t get the idea that they’re somehow “immune” to deportations now. They need to be here to study, not take part in protests and anti-American movements. If they want to do that, they can kiss their visa goodbye.",ITrCool,2025-04-25T20:32:41,5
So you think that people that shoplift anything should get the harshest punishment possible?,packet23,2025-04-26T13:29:06,0
"The left is desperate for validation, so they do whatever will get them headpats.  Those controlling the distribution of headpats steer them towards collapsing their own country by flooding it with criminals and terrorist supporters.  They have no minds of their own and can't explain why they care about one issue but not another.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-26T02:12:07,6

"The harshest penalty possible?  If you’re a guest in our country and break our rules, then yes, you should go back home.  If I visit a country and break their laws, I should similarly get deported.",cofcof420,2025-04-26T16:00:24,4
