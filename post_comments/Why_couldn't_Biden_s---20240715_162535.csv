"That legal scholar has no credibility if he has forgotten the plain text of the Constitution disallows anyone to be nominated VP who is ineligible to hold the office of president. Obama is ineligible by simple fact that he is already served two full terms.  The 12th Amendment reads that, ""[N]o person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice president of the United States.""",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-07-15T16:54:59,174
"The short answer is - for every 1 pundit that thinks the constitution allows such, there are 200 federal judges that would say nope.",SovietRobot,2024-07-15T17:48:00,25
"The article you linked is very much not in the mainstream, and the wordplay it relies on (""the 22nd Amendment doesn't say the candidate is *ineligible,* just that they shall not be *elected*) is a little non-sensical. Saying that a candidate ""Shall not be elected"" is synonymous with saying they're ineligible.   Beyond the plain reading of the text, if that argument is accepted it makes the 22nd Amendment meaningless. The scheme that you're laying out is exactly what the 22nd Amendment was passed to prevent. Beyond the legal issues (and maybe even election certification issues) that would cause, voters would likely not buy it.   And finally...   > The current dynamics of the Presidential race require Biden to make a bold change if he's to stand a chance in November.  Report's of the campaign's demise have been greatly exaggerated. [The fundamentals are very pro-Biden, which historically offsets the polls which are not great, but four months out](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo)..",Arthur_Edens,2024-07-15T17:07:07,15
The problem with this theory is that the legality would be tested in the Supreme Court and lose regardless of its technical merit.,SMIrving,2024-07-15T20:04:16,4
Could you convince a more favorable Supreme Court to go along with this? Probably. Could you convince the current Supreme Court? Not in a million years.,Yangervis,2024-07-15T18:22:16,3
And they say the right wingers are the threat to democracy… What do you call sneaking Obama in to a third term?,enemy884real,2024-07-17T10:41:55,1
">And in that worst case scenario, wouldn't Obama just be required to be replaced by a different Vice President?  If Obama ascends to the presidency, is ruled ineligible, then what?  If GOP control the US senate then they could blockade any VP confirmation.    Thus, it would fall to the speaker of the house, if that is republican...  or the Senate pro-temp who is next in line.  What if the succession act is also unconstitutional?  That could handover control to the GOP.  This would also set the precedent for Trump to effectively be president many times.",captain-burrito,2024-07-17T17:02:11,1

Do you really think Obama  would want to be VP? I don't.,FeatureOdd4479,2024-07-19T23:11:54,1
"Because voters would see it as a cynical ploy to try and circumvent the constitution even if by the letter of the law it were legal. Perception is reality.  For example, the fake electors scheme by Eastman, et al. It might have been legal but it looks like they were just trying to cheat and that’s the perception we are left with.",ace1244,2024-07-22T19:14:05,1
Can Obama run again as president?  It was be 2 terms since he ran last.,TexasYankee212,2024-07-16T12:34:22,0
If you're ineligible to be president you aren't eligible to be vice president....  Basic government civics classes teach this very simple concept.,cuteman,2024-07-16T00:22:33,-1
Nobody wants another Biden presidency though. They just don’t want Trump in office.,Professional-Ice1392,2024-07-16T09:22:21,-1
"I was surprised at that oversight, and he does address the point.  The argument he makes is that the constitution says ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice”, but there is another clause that address the question of eligibility, so they treat eligibility (age, residence and citizenship) separate from the prohibition from being elected more than twice.    Not saying I agree with it.",solid_reign,2024-07-15T17:07:44,21
"And in the event that the GOP retains the House but this Biden-Obama ticket wins and Obama is disqualified, then a Biden administration with no VP will not get a VP, because the republicans have nothing to lose by keeping a Republican (the Speaker) second in line for the Presidency.  Although, if Obama was ruled ineligible prior to the electoral college vote then I’m not sure if the next highest vote-getter in the VP race would become VP. It’s certainly uncharted territory.",PoliticsDunnRight,2024-07-15T19:53:26,4
"Basically,  the DNC is holding tight to Biden because they've invested this much into him.  Should he resign after taking office, that will be up to him.  What the right fails to realize is that their former poster boy of conservatism, Reagan, served two terms while suffering from early stage Alzheimers.",Swiggy1957,2024-07-15T20:04:14,5
New polling has Biden up on Trump by 3 points even after this week of bumps to Trump.,cadmachine,2024-07-15T20:20:03,4
It would lose for a democrat. But in 2028 the supreme court will allow it for trump.,Lucy_Heartfilia_OO,2024-11-07T08:30:26,1
I don't think it would be sneaking or a threat to democracy.  It would painfully obvious what the play would be and no one should doubt that Biden wouldn't last the full term.    I don't think Obama would be any bigger threat to democracy than he was the first 2 times.  His halo even for many democrats has faded but then again they are desperate.    That said I doubt he'd even want it.,captain-burrito,2024-07-17T17:08:09,1

I don't understand the argument?  Just because it's covered in 2 separate sections doesn't inherently cancel out or add subtext to either to make it plausible?,cadmachine,2024-07-15T20:18:12,10
"I’m not surprised by the oversight at all. The constitution is pretty bad when it comes to these sorts of things. For example, if someone beyond the Vice President becomes *acting* President…:  1) Do they keep the office that placed them in the line of succession?  1A) If not, by virtue of resigning from their office to act as President, do they not then forfeit the position that that allowed them to act as President?   Also, since the constitution states that no legislator can hold office in the executive branch, the Speaker and President Pro Temp are probably unqualified to hold office, and again, if they resign their position to act as President, then they no longer hold the office that is in the line of succession.   2) If a cabinet member becomes acting President, and a new Speaker of the House is elected, does the Speaker then become acting President since they are higher in the line of succession?",Tired_CollegeStudent,2024-07-16T15:21:25,2

"They're treating ""being elected"" and ""being president"" as two separate issues. The Constitution says you can't be elected president a third time, it doesn't specifically say you can't become president by some other means.",wdn,2024-07-16T09:31:54,8
"I am far, far from an expert, but if I had to guess, and if the above commenter was quoting accurately that the first part says ""no person shall be **elected** to the office of the President more than twice"", then in the case of the president stepping down and the vice president taking over, the vice president would not be being *elected* to the office of the President, so the statement ""no person shall be **elected** to the office of the President more than twice"" would still hold true.   If the wording was ""no person shall **hold** to the office of the President more than twice"" then there would be no question.  Again, just a guess, but I know how important specific wording can be when interpreting the law!",lindymad,2024-07-16T03:40:01,7
"Maybe I didn't explain it clearly, sorry about that.  They're saying that the constitution has a specific clause for eligibility.  That clause is about age, residence and citizenship.  They are arguing that the 2nd clause, about being elected more than twice, is not about eligibility but about electability.  They argue this because the first clause specifically talks about a person constitutionally eligible, but the 2nd clause talks about how no person shall be ""elected"".",solid_reign,2024-07-15T20:38:22,6
"Obama is not ineligible to be president, just ineligible to be elected president. He could become speaker of the house for example and if the president and VP both resigned become president. So the argument is he’s therefore not ineligible to be elected vice president. This same logic had been floated as a way to keep Trump president forever.",Mimshot,2024-07-16T17:19:06,1

"It's weird, but it's also weird that the constitutional amendment was written that way. There's no reason to include the word ""elected"" at all if they didn't mean to specify it.",wdn,2024-07-18T14:01:09,0
