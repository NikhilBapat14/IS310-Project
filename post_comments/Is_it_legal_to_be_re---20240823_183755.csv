"You will automatically be purged from the Pennsylvania voter rolls over time as part of federally required list maintenance. As long as you only vote once, in the place of your primary residence, you're all legal and good",JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-08-24T11:30:37,34
The legal honus is on the election board from where you departed to expunge you. You don't have to do anything.  Though if you tried to vote on both places you'd be arrested for voter fraud.,federalist66,2024-08-24T14:12:44,15
"You may cancel your Pennsylvania voter registration using the form at https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/vote/resources/documents-and-forms/Voter_Request_to_Cancel_Registration_English.pdf . I don’t know that any state *requires* you to do it, but it prevents operatives of a specific political persuasion from comparing registration lists, and going “Aha! Klickytat was registered in two states, so they clearly committed voter fraud!”.     (And remember, when you hear claims that  thousands of people voted twice, it’s almost always based upon comparing voter registration lists, not lists of who actually voted.)",phoarksity,2024-08-24T14:14:38,10
"It's illegal to vote twice, but not really illegal to be registered to vote more than once. Your case is a perfect example of why. There's no real mechanism for a state's internal administration to be regulated by any other state, so when you move to NY and register to vote, PA doesn't really have any way of knowing and NY doesn't really care. This is why most states will periodically purge their voter rolls of inactive voters, and why lots of voter lists have inactive voters in the first place.",mormagils,2024-08-26T13:01:19,3

Hey there. I moved from PA 5 years ago.  I am just now getting a letter from them telling me I MUST fill out the form they mailed to me and mail it back to them in order to be removed as a registered voter in PA.  And technically I am still a registered voter in NJ.  I registered when I was 18.  Moved to PA for a long time. Now live in southwest for 5 years and NJ never removed me after 20 years of not living there.  Call your ex county in PA and ask them to send you the form to be removed.  Or next election you will get hounded with texts and calls from BOTH states.,Advanced-Attitude-90,2024-11-03T13:54:24,2
"It’s not legal to vote in 2 states, I’m not sure being registered in 2 states is illegal.  I’ve switched states a number of times.  I always register but have never unregistered, not sure how to do that.  I understand that Mark Meadows,trumps Chief of Staff was registered somewhere outside DC and also in a NC town where he kept a trailer.  Rumor (can’t confirm) is he voted twice in 2020, so perhaps the voter fraud danger is subject to review. There was also some guy in NC who collected mail in ballots from people and filtered them illegally, in another example of potential voter fraud.  He also was not prosecuted. I wouldn’t try it personally.",stebak52,2024-08-26T14:48:32,1
FYI you can vote twice if you leave NY and they don’t require ID so you can just vote twice bc NY doesn’t purge anything,TakeOnBigTechdotcom,2024-08-27T21:01:27,1
"Does anyone know if it’s legal to vote in both states but different elections? Vote for president in PA, but for state senate in NY?",steelers3279,2024-10-14T21:18:35,1
You'll eventually be purged out of your previous states registration. Voting twice consiltitutes voter fraud and can land you jail time. Just vote in your new state and don't worry about the previous state.,jocrow1996,2024-10-16T11:16:40,1
"If someone is register in one state but votes in another, what happens?",HaWt_SaWcE62,2024-11-05T13:39:28,1
You could probably vote twice I doubt the systems even cross check. They don’t require ID many states,[deleted],2024-10-30T00:57:42,2
Don't think that's true. I have now been registered in Florida for 7 years and still receive voting ballots in WA. Voting by mail is fraud. Make sure to go in,Sweet-Obligation5570,2024-11-03T09:02:33,2
Incorrect.  It’s been 5 years for me in AZ and PA just FINALLY sent me a letter stating I need to fill out their form and mail it back to be removed.,Advanced-Attitude-90,2024-11-03T13:50:29,2
How would they figure that out?,ProLifePanda,2024-08-25T18:44:33,1
"What if you just vote in one but it is your previous place of residence? I just moved from PA within the past couple months to TX and am currently registered in both places, but would really rather mail in my ballot to PA bc my vote would matter more there. Lol I'm guessing it's not the best idea though....",gingerbread1001,2024-10-04T11:25:54,1

"That’s what I was wondering, if you legitimately only vote for president in one state, but want to vote in local in both states because you perhaps live in both states part time and you want to weigh in in both states",BeautifulRow7605,2024-11-10T06:33:55,1
I believe that the handful of people who try this every year got caught because the state Election Boards share data so if someone votes twice they ding on both Boards' computers.,federalist66,2024-08-25T19:03:47,5
Yeah but there’s no controls to prevent it’s just an honor system and  someone else can just walk in say that’s you (no id requirement in NY or CA),TakeOnBigTechdotcom,2024-11-05T06:19:50,1
"Alot more than a handful and they don’t share info with other states, they do share with other counties within the stat though. I worked the polls last election and you would be shocked how easy it is to vote multiple times and get away with it. Im almost positive people have voted 50 times before. One mail in ballot at the last moment to every state.",FineSupplements,2024-09-25T21:38:11,0
It’s sad how easy fraud is…I can’t believe in 2024 we have nothing better,[deleted],2024-10-30T00:59:25,1
"That’s BS. I’ve worked the pills in PA for decades. No one can vote twice unless they moved and registered in their new location. And even with that, they’d have to drive back and forth to each polling location to vote. NO ONE can walk into a polling location 50 times and vote. You check in and they look your name up. I’m so sick of people like you saying it’s easy to cheat with voting. IT IS NOT",[deleted],2024-11-02T07:29:08,1
No. I’m sorry that person’s comment is 100% wrong. I’ve worked the pills for decades. No one is voting 50 times. That statement is complete BS. Tells me all I need to know about that person’s maga leanings because it’s just not true what they wrote. Period.,[deleted],2024-11-02T07:30:46,1
Reading comprehension is obviously difficult for you. Who TF said anything about walking in? Go take a spelling and English course before you come at me with a made up rebuttal.,FineSupplements,2024-11-02T09:26:53,1
Oh great. Another democrat working the polls.  I assume 80% of the poll workers are anti Trump.  So much for fair.  You guys holding the keys to all the doors huh?  Yep,[deleted],2024-11-02T12:02:57,1
