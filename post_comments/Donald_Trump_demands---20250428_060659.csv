This is that little bit of reality sneaking in to his moronic bubble. When he discovers that the rest of the world won't kiss his ass like his sycophants and fellow travelers do, he will react with mindless rage.   Combine that with the dementia and it gets even worse. He's going to continue declining and raging and there's not much we can really do about it.

And if anybody caves due to his lawsuits/threats then we know we can‚Äôt trust polling from them anymore. If that happens the pollsters need to quit‚Ä¶  And why tf can‚Äôt we get any pro-democracy billionaires or orgs to set up a legal fund for people/institutions thst come under attack? That would be a smart thing to do and maybe it‚Äôs happening behind the scenes but we need to reduce the costs of litigation from the regime; it‚Äôs quickly become one of its main weapons.",airbear13,2025-04-28T08:47:22,1

"""Vote for me, I'm not a Republican"" has been the entire platform of the Democrats for decades. They've never relied upon what they've actually accomplished to get voters, because they don't accomplish much or even try to accomplish much even when they have the reigns of power and thus are perfectly capable of accomplishing a lot.     The Democratic party has always sat on their asses doing next to nothing, let the Republicans get in and screw up the country, and then use that to get back in where rather than taking measures to stop the Republicans from screwing up the country again, they at most clean up after the Republicans until the Republicans get back in and the cycle continues. As a result, the Republican party has been chipping away at our freedoms for a long time, leading to Trump ever even being a possibility. The vast majority of what Trump is doing right now should have and had grounds in the past already to put measures to stop whether Trump had all three branches of government or not.      The Democrats could have stopped all of this just in the last four years but did next to nothing, as they always do, because doing something takes effort. The fact that the Democratic party has survived solely off of letting the Republicans put the noose around their own necks for decades meant they never felt like they had to put in effort.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T22:24:21,1

I mean you could see it live. Zooming in on it let you see that it was definitely the distinct weird green color of Adderall. Like I said, rumor has it he snorts it. Those rumors preceded his Presidential campaign although they really only started getting published after because before who gave a shit. Oh some mid celebrity does drugs BIG SURPRISE.  There's also the number of times that he's gone on a 2am fucking bizarre tweet binge which has happened enough that it's just considered a regular day in Trump world.

He and Musk were hanging out a good bit for a while there at the end of the campaign, Trump doesn't drink alcohol and Musk has a fairly not all that about it attitude about alcohol as well, they're both into Diet Coke in a big way but what I was gonna say is that it's my experience that when it comes to hanging out/travelling together, especially when you're talking about people as rich as those two, people who are users tend to hang out with other people who are also users, it gets annoying hiding everything.

He probably has self-deception.  It works like this and is close to how his supporters work as well:  1. Initial Dishonesty: The person deliberately tells a lie - usually for gain, avoidance, protection, or to manage how they are perceived.   2. Repetition and Rationalization: They repeat the lie to others and themselves. Each time, they rationalize it internally (""Maybe it did happen that way,"" ""It wasn't really a lie"").   3. Cognitive Dissonance Reduction: Holding two conflicting ideas (""I am honest"" vs. ""I lied"") creates discomfort (cognitive dissonance). To reduce that, the mind starts reshaping memory, feelings, and interpretations to align with the lie.   4. Memory Distortion: Over time, false memories can form. The brain ‚Äúfills in gaps‚Äù in favor of the lie. This isn't intentional anymore it‚Äôs subconscious.   5. Identity Integration: The lie becomes part of the person‚Äôs narrative identity. They now sincerely ""remember"" it as true, defending it emotionally and cognitively.   6.

Trump decided to have a rally for Veterans instead.  He amazingly raised $5 million for the organizations and then only paid out after he was sued.   Trump about that time threatened to run as an independent but Priebus (then the RNC Chair) and Ailes of Fox convinced him to stay with the GOP because it woud have handed Hillary a win.

He also stated his strategy to ETHNICALLY CLEANSE GAZA and built resorts and casinos.

"Sure the Democrats tried to warn us about it. They also had the opportunity to stop it for four years and did absolutely nothing about it. Biden alone could have gotten Trump on trial and in prison with ease at any point in Biden's presidency but didn't because he didn't want to ""seem unfair."" Even though he had every cause to do so entirely legally and fairly.       All Biden really would have had to do was fire Garland and replace him with someone who would have gone on the warpath against Trump rather than obstructing the legal proceedings in every way he could like Garland did. Something Biden could have done with the stroke of a pen, and Trump would be in prison right now and certainly would have been disqualified from running for president.     We also slid into fascism because the Democrats included allowed money into politics because they stood to benefit from it, and then sat back while the Republicans kept eroding our freedoms and allowing corruption to take root. There's a number of things the Democrats could have done to not only stop Trump as president from ever being a thing, but to stop Trump even if he did somehow still get in from doing the vast majority of the garbage he's doing right now. Providing measures that force the president to actually follow SCOTUS orders would be one, and means to get rid of presidents like Trump without requiring impeachment or 25th amendmenting them.         Getting rid of gerrymandering and voter suppression is another big one, it's the only reason Republicans have a chance of winning basically anywhere. There are already laws against these but it's not enforced because there's no measures to ensure Republican controlled areas don't engage in it.     That's before we get into the fact that the Democratic platform for decades has been ""The Republicans suck!"" rather than ""look at what we've accomplished!"" They let the Republicans and to screw up the country with little to no real push back because it lets them do this strategy, where they don't have to actually put in effort to get into power, all they have to do is look like the sane alternative, and then sit on their asses whenever they ARE in power.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-28T22:51:57,2

There was discussion of using it after the January 6th insurrection.

If they had gone that route it would have been enough to last to the end of his term.  Talking about it now is pointless. Impeachment is the only constitutional remedy for a criminal president.  Technically the 25th was not intended exclusively for temporary medical conditions although it has only been used as such.

"You have to understand, to his supporters nothing has happened yet that would be seen as something to revolt about.   A lot of Trumpers can justify them deporting immigrants, even if they have legal protections, because they weren't born here.   A lot of Trumpers can justify deporting U.S Citizen children if their mother was born in a different country.  I would wager a lot of Trumpers **won't support** deporting US Citizens with no criminal record and no ties to other countries.   We haven't reached a tipping point yet for a lot of people, but it certainly looks like we will get there.  You also have to keep in mind, that, while yes the rest of the world is laughing at us, most of that same world isn't accepting nearly as many immigrants into their countries.   Most of the the developed world are just as racist, if not more racist than Americans. (look at South Korea, or Japan, which still have restaurants and businesses that won't let white people even step inside).

It's actually slightly harder to find the number of citizens than residents because it's not collected in census data. However, [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/State_demographics_by_citizenship_status) indicates that of the US population 86.9% are natural-born citizens, 6% are naturalized citizens, and 7.1% are non-citizens. We'll just assume that this proportion of the total population is the same as the percentages in the voting age population, giving us an estimated total of 234.3M voting age citizens.   Of course, not all voting age citizens are eligble to vote due to being disenfranchised from the vote by virtue of felon status, with [approximately 8%](https://news.uga.edu/total-us-population-with-felony-convictions/) of the adult population having a felony conviction. We'll assume that this percentage is equal amongst adult citizens and non-citizens, and we'll further assume that none of these people are eligible to vote. That drops the total number of voting age citizens who have the franchise to 215.5M  That means Harris received 75M out of 215.5M votes, or 34.8% of the potential voters.

"It seems like you think she should feel safe now, and her peace of mind should be restored?  Well...UNLESS and UNTIL he directs violent words (and thereby violent goons) at her again?  I'm not a fan of Cheney, but she showed tremendous integrity taking on Trump, and she has gotten thoroughly punished for it.  She has been physically threatened recently, and will always be 'under threat' from Trump or his nutzo followers, possibly even after he's dead and gone.  That said, I'm not sure what evidence of 'active punishment' would satisfy you:  does she need a daily physical threat, or maybe a DOJ investigation, like Chris Krebs, Trump's former Cybersecurity Chief - is getting for refuting Trump's Big Lie?  Let's just suffice it to say that he's vindictive, and he never fails to threaten and harass and try to professionally harm anyone who speaks out against him -- especially in his own orbit.

"And it‚Äôs evident through pretty much every rise of a Facsist state, human beings are creatures of comfort, especially in the modern age.

"When that guy who wrote *How to Talk to Your Kid about Fascism* did that AMA, he said that it tends to end with the fascists' base turning on them. Which confirmed something I'd been thinking for a long time: they're better organized, more willing to use violence, and *pissed off* about having been taken for a ride. I mean, they were already looking for an enemy to fight. People think it's impossible for them to turn, but, no? I mean, I'm sure there will be *some* holdouts, but rural Republicans are already turning faster than I expected. Because it's affecting them. Drives me crazy how so many people just throw up their hands when most people haven't even been affected much yet.",newyne,2025-04-28T11:45:14,6
"I do think it's important to note there's a kind of selection bias involved as well. ""Successful"" fascist regimes are more likely to get studied. They're more likely to actually get far enough with their agenda to be indisputably fascist in the first place, even.   (For example, I think it's a lot less likely future historians would be talking about this current Trump administration as fascist if he had ended up losing the election, so all these things people have been warning about never came to pass. And I think it's even more likely they will describe it as such if there is not a successful resistance movement before they escalate to the point of killing people.)   This means history provides an at least slightly pessimistic outlook by focusing on regimes where early resistance movements were unsuccessful because too many citizens thought the risk of resisting outweighed the risk of complying. While it's important to learn from history, it's also important to keep this in mind. Otherwise you risk serving the regime by propagating the kind of pessimism and hopelessness that keep people from resisting by normalizing their inaction and undermining their hope for success.   So far, your country is still at a stage where a lot of the risks can be mitigated by organization and mutual aid. There's power and safety in numbers, and it's much easier to participate in something like a general strike if you have a support network that will keep you from starving in the process. Go to protests not only to voice your displeasure but also to find like-minded people and build the kinds of networks that enable direct action and make it easier for others to join in.   Civil resistance has a mixed track record, but there are plenty of cases where it has effected meaningful change, and non-violent resistance tends to have much better results in the long term. This site has some useful resources: https://www.nonviolent-conflict.org/icnc-publications/. The framing essay for the 2023 Copenhagen People Power Conference is a great read for anybody who is feeling like people have no power against their governments or violence is the only useful means of resistance.   I'd highly recommend including some kind of feasible call to action in comments like the one I'm replying to, so they don't end up as self-fulfilling prophecies that ultimately do more harm than good. Ordinary people have been absolutely crucial in all kinds of civil resistance movements, and waiting for extraordinary heroes to swoop in and save the day doesn't tend to work very well.",as_it_was_written,2025-04-28T13:17:29,5

Like it doesn't even matter if the worm did or did not eat part of his brain, or if he was just lying to cover up his chronic infidelity issues.

"> You lump together. I wouldn't lump them in and say 2/3rds were against you. By that logic I could easily say you got how many people registered, I guess I should count you and I against democracy too if neither of us helped to get those people registered.  There is a difference between being a superstar and doing your basic civic duty. It's reasonable to draw a line at being responsible for your own actions. It is absolutely fair to say that people who voted for this, chose not to vote, or didn't bother to vote are worthy of derision on some level.   I acknowledge that voting isn't as easy as it should be in many places. I moved from Mississippi to Washington state and it's amazing the difference. I went from what is objectively one of the hardest places to vote to one of the easiest. I went from a state that only had excuse required for absentee/mail-in ballot (even during COVID!!) with polling only open on election day to a state where you're by default registered to vote when you get your driver's license, everyone receives a ballot by mail, and they send a freakin' book outlining everything on your ballot. But I still managed to vote in either location. It amazes me that in Washington state, where it is SO easy to vote that still only ~70% of eligible voters vote. Compare that with my former state where it's a lot harder, they have a 57.5% participation rate. For how much easier it is to vote in WA, it amazes me that it only moves the needle for ~ 3 in 20 people.  As much as we like to talk about the difficulty in voting, most states actually do have decent access to the ballot with early voting periods / mail-in ballots, and at some point there is a problem amongst the citizenry not caring.",mitrie,2025-04-28T13:33:04,1
