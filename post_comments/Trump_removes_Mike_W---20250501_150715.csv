"There were 'signs' of this in Goldberg's Atlantic interview of Trump ... Waltz had ""just left the room"" and it was easy to tell - even in print - that Trump was taken aback by the interviewer's interest:  >**Trump:** Waltz is fine. I mean, he’s here. He just left this office. He’s fine. He was beat up also.  Yup.  Beat up by the manbaby-in-charge.  These Trump water-carrying dummies need to look to their left, and to their right.   Leftie will find out he's fired by having a cellphone news article pop up, while he's working.  Rightie will be given the holy ""executive privilege"" blessing, and get sent up on Contempt.  Buh Bye Trumpies...  Don't let Z Teslas hit ya on the way out....

"Just like Trump wearing a blue suit to Pope Francis' funeral, boorishly demanding a front-row seat, then falling asleep. Brings new meaning to the term ""Ugly American"".",Nerd-19958,2025-05-01T23:59:45,1
