Everyone who saw that Biden was cognitively impaired and refused to acknowledge it placed the nations security in peril. Those aides who concealed the fact should be held accountable. Their names should be released to the public and should never be allowed to hold any position in the government.,STGC_1995,2025-05-04T15:25:28,11
"It's amazing just how many people were involved in the cover-up of Joe Biden's declined. His own staff, the media, newspapers, news stations, influencers. The Democrat Party deceived and found so many people to help them further deceive the masses. Truly amazing. Some dark stuff going on there.",GeoChallenge,2025-05-04T15:19:39,33
"Why take a test that you already know is not going to end with the results you’re hoping for?  They knew… like FULLY knew all the way back in 2020… that’s why they kept him stashed in the basement. Anyone trying to play off, “oh… we didn’t know.” Is either brain-dead… or just a fucking outright liar. I’m speculating it’s the latter mostly.",fearless-penguin,2025-05-04T15:49:22,28

Well ... ya gotta maintain plausible deniability ....,Phil152,2025-05-04T15:47:28,10
That seems like a totally easy way to find out if he really had cognitive decline. (They were claiming at the time that he didn't) It's like they didn't even want to know,Far_Tap_9966,2025-05-04T16:28:14,5
"Then acting like it was a big revelation when he shit the bed in the June debate. Half the country had been shouting from the mountaintops about his senility since 2020.   The democrats like to feign innocence by throwing him under the bus. But they didn’t replace him on the ticket because of his mental health. They replaced him because they became unable to hide it.   All these tell-all books will be fascinating, and all the authors will be guilty as sin of the cover up. This isn’t FDR and his wheelchair. A wheelchair isn’t as impactful to your ability to do to the job as much as *whether you’re fucking lucid*",f1sh98,2025-05-05T06:33:21,8
Covid was the perfect excuse for the way they hid Biden throughout the entire 2020 Presidential campaign and then continued it throughout his presidency.,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-05-04T18:59:00,10
"Agree, but I’d add many are extremely influenced by a super lefty biased media, and as they say - denial isn’t  just a river in Egypt.",cliffotn,2025-05-04T15:53:43,6
