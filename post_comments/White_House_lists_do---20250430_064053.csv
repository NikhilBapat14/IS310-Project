I'm just here for some downvotes since we know how these facts will upset the usual suspects.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-04-30T07:29:05,55
"Having looked at the list, it's everything the average redditor believes and parrots. Given the revelation of the widespread nature of AI bots being used to shape opinions on Reddit, it's no wonder than 90% of the views on this platform are so out-of-touch with anything approaching reality.",squunkyumas,2025-04-30T08:14:41,15
The Left is pretty upset that MAGA won't Nazi for them. They have to fabricate it.,AppState1981,2025-04-30T07:03:46,10
"The problem is that the low information people who consume MSM info believe the hoaxes. Even if an outlet corrects the record it's done in an offhand way and the narrative lives on. Then moron Democrat politicians, i.e. Adam Schiff, continue to make false claims, flat out lying about them. WaPo and the NYT both got Pulitzers for their coverage of Russia Russia Russia and do you think they gave them back when that was disproven? Not on your life.",social_dinosaur,2025-04-30T07:17:31,7
"All of the mainstream media outlets have pounded the President's administration with negative coverage. Well over 90% of the coverage has been negative. We need honesty and integrity in the ""free"" press.",StillTruthSeeking,2025-04-30T07:02:49,2

"While I identify with your anger & assessment of the media, just do away with that pesky first amendment huh?  (I imagine that's why the downvotes)",bozoconnors,2025-04-30T08:26:37,42
It's okay. Just means the left is reading the truth for once.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-30T08:04:58,6
