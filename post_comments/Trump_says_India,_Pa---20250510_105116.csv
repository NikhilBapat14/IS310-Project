"You mean the terrorist harboring country reacted to Trumps boast by sucking up to Trump to look like he has a bigger friend?   India has stated the US did not lead the negotiations as I'm sure it was their OWN agreement to ceasefire with other countries along with the us as witnesses to their talks.  You know like having a disagreement with a coworker and bringing in other coworkers so you both can check yourselves or have witnesses.    It's no surprise the terrorist harboring country of Pakistan sucks up to the US because they are surrounded by many other countries who are a threat. Israel, Afghanistan and Iran.    My country isn't their bigger brother. They can fuck off.    Pakistans neighbors cant stand them.  ",Witty-Revolution8742,2025-05-10T16:58:34,1
