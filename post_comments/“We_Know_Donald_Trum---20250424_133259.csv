"“We Know Donald Trump Wants the Story to Die”  Democrats return to El Salvador, looking for gay makeup artist thrown into CECOT.  Andry Romero, a 31-year-old Venezuelan makeup artist was classified as a gang member because he has tattoos that say “mom” and “dad” with crowns. He has been documented to have no history of criminal activity. No one has heard from him since March 14.  “Everyone is extremely worried about him. We’ve had no proof of life in over a month.”  https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-wants-story-to-die-democratic-members-congress-el-salvador-cecot-kilmar-abrego-garcia-andry-hernandez-romero?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web",HunterS_1981,2025-04-24T13:33:57,980
"Yes, exactly.  This is very important: **The trump administration wants everyone to forget about the men sent to El Salvador.** And they're trying to send more, although that was blocked this past weekend by the Supreme court. But there are people who have been at CECOT since mid-March. CECOT is a concentration camp designed for physical and mental suffering, and the only way out is to die. (Kilmar Abrego Garcia is the exception; he was transferred to a different prison.)  The trump admin would **LOVE** for Democrats to stop talking about this. Everyone's supposed to just say ""They were gang members. Oh well. It's good that they're gone."" And we're all supposed to forget about it and move on. If the public forgets about this story, that gives the trump admin the green light to send more and more people to be imprisoned in El Salvador and other countries. To be clear, they can send anyone to a foreign prison. Including people who have never committed any crimes. Including people who immigrated legally. Including American citizens.  **Keep this story in the news.** As soon as the public forgets, the trump admin can disappear *anyone.*",sachiprecious,2025-04-24T13:49:01,947

No gang connection. It's beyond foul.  And even if he WERE a member of a criminal gang, he would STILL absolutely need due process. And if charged and tried of crimes, sending him to CECOT would still be an abject violation of his basic human rights.

"It's actually kind of crazy how badly Trump and his ICE Nazis misjudged this particular policy. Since the inauguration, Trump's approval ratings on most issues have dropped drastically, and he even singlehandedly reversed the positive approval rating that all Republicans tend to have on economic policy. But for a while, his approval rating on immigration policy was still positive, showing that most Americans like it when their leaders are pointlessly cruel to non-white immigrants.  But by some miracle, the sustained focus on Kilmar Abrego Garcia and other innocent people sent to the CECOT concentration camp hurt Trump's approval rating on immigration. And he hurt himself even more by refusing to back down and instigating a full-on constitutional crisis, which his base loves but most Americans don't.

People who don't pay attention to news can still understand that if someone was deported by mistake, and the US either cannot or will not bring them back, either way, that's bad. Other people may also be deported by mistake and then not brought back.  So I think that's why the story broke through.

"I think it's worth talking about to consider what will happen if the world finds out they murdered Romero in that jail.  How comfortable is MAGA with a confirmed death camp being run by Trump and the president of El Salvador? And how comfortable would they be with the fact that a non-criminal was sent there to die?  What happens next after *that* news breaks? That the United States has literal death camps that they're sending non-criminals to?  My guess is MAGA will cheer. They'll ask for more. Because it's not them being deported, it's those ""bad"" people. Right now on the Conservative sub they're doing their usual Olympic level mental gymnastics to try and say immigrants don't deserve due process, even while being totally aware that Trump's gestapo is deporting US citizens and non-criminals. They really, REALLY, hate brown people. I don't think a confirmed death camp will sway them in the slightest. They'll want *more*.
