"No other President has done this at even 1% of this scale.      I hear so much about Pelosi's getting rich on insider information (me-not a Dem and don't like Pelosi) but where are the MAGAs complaining about this?      Hey, Bud? Want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge? I also have bitcoins I got for free that I will sell you for $100 each - nowhere to go but up! Want one with my face on it?      OK, waiting for the true and false ""Yeah, Buts"" ...",Last_Lonely_Traveler,2025-05-02T10:54:29,18

"This is the number one story about Trump that every responsible business and political journalist, as well as every media outlet should be highlighting.  This is about abuse of public office on an eye-watering scale, on a scale that has never been seen before.   Trump is dipping his grubby hands into the business of government, taking every opportunity to enrich himself at the expense of the American taxpayer.  If allowed to continue like this, he will use his position during the next four years to siphon off hundreds of billions of dollars into his own pocket.   This is no longer about politics of the right or left, this is about politics of the right or wrong and what Trump is doing is monumentally wrong.",crazybones,2025-05-02T14:29:33,5
