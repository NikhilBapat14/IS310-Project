"So, there's a little difference between how vacancies in the Senate are handled, compared to the House. The Constitution provides:Â    >When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate, the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies: **Provided, That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct.**   This means that the State governors can make temporary appointments to the Senate if they're authorized by their states law. [Here](https://ballotpedia.org/Filling_vacancies_in_the_U.S._Senate) is an article that breaks down what each state allows their governor to do with regards to Senate vacancies.   In the House, all vacancies have to be filled by elections. Governors may not make temporary appointments to the House like they can with the Senate. When these elections are held are determined by state law.",PaleontologistOk7794,2024-11-14T06:04:59,13
"The law varies by state, but typically there's a special election for House members. If a Senator leaves, sometimes the state's governor will name a replacement who fill then have an election for the remainder of the term.",meelar,2024-11-14T06:06:17,4
