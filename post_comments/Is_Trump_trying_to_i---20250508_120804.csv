"Trump is a narcissist. He can’t imagine people disagreeing with him. He would not expect a riot. Now, Stephen Miller might be inciting a race riot.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-08T12:10:36,47
Trump wants martial law. He is obviously bigoted but any one who defies him will be his target.,RodeoSex,2025-05-08T12:13:30,30
All of Trump and the GOP's power comes from convincing ignorant white people they're losing a race war that doesn't exist and they're living on the precipice of an apocalypse.,Jubal81,2025-05-08T12:41:59,13
"He wants enough violence to trigger the imposition of martial law. It needn’t be racial. In fact, he will probably make highly exaggerated remarks about a nearly innocuous situation to portray it as a riot. Look at the lies coming out of Jessie Waters at Fox regarding a Columbia University library that was occupied. He’s portraying it as violent with destruction and resisting the police. Everything is an “emergency” to this man with impending doom unless he overreacts.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-08T13:01:28,6
Usually.,AINonsense,2025-05-08T12:10:20,3
"Whether it's started via racial inequities, financial inequities, or political inequities, he wants civil unrest to help him declare martial law and implement his draconian policies he's unable to carry out now during peacetime.",PansophicNostradamus,2025-05-08T13:03:57,4
"Since he's been calling immigrants and refugees an ""invasion,"" he's been inspiring mass shooters. (Such as at the Squirrel Hill synagogue, or Christchurch, or El Paso, or Buffalo, or El Paso again, or so many others.) I have to assume he wants that, and he wouldn't mind a Tulsa-style race riot/pogrom either.",Ananiujitha,2025-05-08T13:05:12,4
Any excuse for martial law will do.,Weird-Ad7562,2025-05-08T13:35:40,4
He wants a reason to send troops into sanctuary cities.,AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-08T16:01:55,4
"Obviously trumps trying to speed up a race riot in order to kill more innocent protesters, minorities and women   Save the fbi and the government a lot of money busing in these people from out of state to riot lol",Fabulous_Witness_246,2025-05-08T12:15:40,7
Yes,PrideofPicktown,2025-05-08T12:16:29,3
Yes.,NorseYeti,2025-05-08T12:35:02,3
if trump does do that it will be a start of a new civil war. and possibly marshal law,saiyanscaris,2025-05-08T16:29:21,2
Yes,TrashAcnt1,2025-05-08T19:28:29,2
Duh,melvinscam,2025-05-08T12:14:11,2
He wants chaos and unrest to justify emergency powers for himself.,Thisam,2025-05-09T09:50:40,1
Yes. Especially if one side of that group calls him leader and looks up to him and admires him,OldschoolScience,2025-05-09T20:42:53,1
"I'm really doubtful of this conspiracy theory, which to me just seems like people are wishing for drama or violence, but either way it seems like a good idea to, you know, not riot in that case since it would easily help Trump's popularity at a time when he's sinking.",Scarlettail,2025-05-08T12:19:59,-9
"Oh, Trump fantasizes using his big, beautiful military against people he doesn't like or have a use for.  He tried hard to make up excuses to shoot George Floyd protesters. I would expect him to send both military and camera crews to Minneapolis when he pardons Chauvin.",Revolutionary_Air_40,2025-05-08T12:36:46,21
"I suspect Stephen Miller, along with vought is the primary architecht for much of what has been going on. He is absolutely using Trump for cover in case the regime falls and we go looking for him.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T20:52:12,4
"I would counter to say he’s the type of narcissist who does imagine people disagreeing and banks on it. That discourse landed him in office twice. People are fully entranced by his self serving hatred on both sides, for various reasons, but I think it’s because the dissonance caused by recognizing white supremacy as an arbitrary confine/miscarriage of justice/ governance and not a heuristic trait of society dissolves the base of many identities which have built foundations on its teachings of meritocracy and conformity. The people who see it can’t understand those who don’t, and those who don’t are either deeply misinformed or only feel powerful in proximity in a landscape where ismistic systems are normative.",Zealousideal-Mix2338,2025-05-08T13:58:27,3
It would let him declare martial law. It would let him suspend the constitution. Yes he wants any kind of violent protest. He’s goons will try and force the issue by throwing the first rock every damn time.,AVGuy42,2025-05-09T06:32:40,1
He’s waiting for people to take shots at ICE agents so he can justify a real crackdown.,Marginallyhuman,2025-05-08T14:26:29,7

"I don't think it's Trump's goal, however, I'm not sure when it comes to the Project 2025 people that surround him.",RawChickenButt,2025-05-08T12:30:12,9
"Yes yes, quietly get onto the trains to the death camps. We know. We haven't forgotten how the good German thinks",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T20:55:19,3
Trump cannot pardon Chauvin for the convictions at the state level.  I doubt Governor Tim Walz is going to agree to such a thing.,recovername,2025-05-08T21:43:58,4
"You only have to watch the EO signings, he has no idea what he is putting his signature on.  There is always someone there to explain to him what is in the order, sometimes he will utter those immortal words, ""Oh, this is a big one"" when it lines up with something he has gone on about for ages.",kuulmonk,2025-05-09T05:41:47,2
"Absolutely.  And the first time it happens, no matter how justified all police and military members will be on board with it.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T20:54:29,1
It doesn't need to be imposed across the entire country just the 7 major metro cities that house 80% of the actual **people** living in the country.   They don't need brownshirts combing the farm fields in Nebraska for example ,Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-05-08T12:25:32,20
Part of the Heritage Foundation 2025 plan I'm thinking.  Ppl need to pay attention to the scum behind the scenes.,CatoblepasQueefs,2025-05-08T12:35:13,17
"There’s a very detailed written plan, should you care to read it.",sylbug,2025-05-08T14:54:58,7
"Yes, it is. Along with police and militia if necessary. You don't need to cover everyone, just enough to instill fear in the rest. That is how dictators manage to secure power.  There aren't more of them, they're just more violent.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-08T20:54:00,5
"Is the U.S. military even homogeneous enough to turn against their brothers? Least of all for an oligarchy?  Regardless, at a minimum the military is sworn to defend the constitution.",No_Anxiety285,2025-05-08T12:55:19,3
"Correct.  However, that won't stop Trump from pardoning for the federal crimes, which is enough to aggravate the locals.  Of course Trump will likely harass Walz because he won't pardon the state convictions, but there is no love lost between those two guys, so that part won't matter.",Georgina_17,2025-05-09T16:51:21,1
">Regardless, at a minimum the military is sworn to defend the constitution.  So is POTUS. How's that going?",Generic-Username-235,2025-05-08T16:45:45,2
