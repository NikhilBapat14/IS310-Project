Trump and Hegseth said fire them.  What reasons do they always use? Come on guys you know it's just to purge any opposition.  Not a purge for any other reason than that. ,arilupe,2025-05-07T07:03:10,11
"Trump and his handlers are positioning themselves to be able to pull off something BIG coming up; like cancelling the midterm elections, dissolving/arresting members of Congress, or arresting/nullifying  the Supreme Court.   They need as many dependable (personally loyal to Trump over the Constitution)  command assets in place as they can get before they flip the switch on an op like that.     When that happens, there will likely  be a military coup attempt by members of the military still loyal to their Constitutional oath if Trump tries any of those things, and having more Trump ultra-loyalists already in power positions  within the military structure can minimize the impact of a coup against him.

I think they’re going to have elections and rig them. When people go to protest the obvious bs results they will call on the military to suppress the people.   Trump has already let slip he rigged this one twice already and it happened in the morning both times when dementia patients are often more lucid.,Nords1981,2025-05-07T09:09:04,5
