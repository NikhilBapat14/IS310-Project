"I would get in his ear and tell him if he really wants to be better than Biden he should do the things Biden couldn’t do. Like codify Roe and get socialized healthcare.

"He never takes advice. His trade adviser, Peter Navarro,[ has literally said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/experts-agree-trump-has-made-washington-hostile-to-experts/2018/03/27/1cb60912-3138-11e8-8abc-22a366b72f2d_story.html) his job is to take Trump's ""intuitions"" and find the analytics that best support it. Because Trump does not conform to evidence and expert advice, he expects his lickspittle advisors to adhere to his whims, no matter how insane.  So if there was one piece of advice to give Trump, if he *had* to take it, it would be to *listen to fucking advice.*",TheOvy,2025-03-14T16:59:40,12

"A joke would be better:  One day the ordeal of being the President of the United States and all the obligations and duties it entails really got to Donald Trump. He was dealing with low poll numbers, other members of the government weren't too happy with him, and even his friends and family were distant. So he decided to seek counsel from previous American presidents who were truly great so he could copy them.  With this in mind, he first went to the Washington monument and asked George Washington for advice. Washington replied ""Trump, you should always be honest and tell the truth.""   That wasn't entirely pleasing to Trump so next he went to the Jefferson Memorial and asked Thomas Jefferson for insight. Jefferson replied back ""Trump, it's important to maintain human rights and follow the constitution.""   Here again, this wasn't exactly what Trump was looking for so he headed to the Lincoln Memoral next. For the third and final attempt, he sought wisdom from Abraham Lincoln. He explained that he already consulted with Washington and Jefferson but they were of little help and he really needed a lot of assistance here.  This time Lincoln paused for a little bit and replied ""Trump, I honestly think the best thing you can do is go see a play.""",Otherwise_Trust_6369,2025-03-14T17:12:15,4

"I would advise him to use some radical technique like hypnosis to figure out how to love himself. He so clearly can’t stand himself. And so the closest he can come to amusing himself is by being entertained by watching others suffer. If he could love himself, then he would be more likely to make better choices for himself, and for others, including those who voted for him, and all other Americans. His power seems to come from the fact that nothing can neutralize his hatred, which looks to me like it comes from self-hatred. You know what they say? Self-haters gonna hate themselves. But imagine all the great things he could accomplish if he was able to change. He really could make America great again, instead of breaking it up and stripping it for parts, which is what he’s doing. And he appears to be stripping it so Musk and a few of his cryptocronies can get off the planet, dooming it in the process. So a related bit of advice would be to get rid of other self-haters in his orbit, especially the insufferable vortex of duplicity and grandiosity that is Elon Musk.",Metatronathon,2025-03-15T16:23:09,1
