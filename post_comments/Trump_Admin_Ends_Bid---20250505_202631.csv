"There needs to be a financial literacy class requirement before taking out student loans.  I remember back in college people thinking they'd hit the big bucks after school and deal with it then. I was cautious about loans due to getting so far into my degree and realizing I hated programming and didn't want to do it as a career.  I've got a brother in-law who went to the same school, taking out loans and still appears to be dealing with them 20 years later.",Nate0110,2025-05-06T02:27:48,14
"I paid for my college, you can pay for yours.  Self important little twats whining about their debt.   Put on your big boy or big girl pants, behaved a little bit like an adult and pay your debt.  It’s not my debt, it’s not the nation’s debt.  ![gif](giphy|HW05UrUSfAzZu)",cliffotn,2025-05-05T23:36:44,11

There’s actually a mini-financial literacy primer as part of the FAFSA.  It’s clear the risk you are taking.  People just want a free lunch and Joe made it clear he would play ball if you voted for him.,Holiday-Tie-574,2025-05-06T08:21:09,2

"I believe you. But the way you describe it, its like the casinos that have to advertise help lines for problem gamblers. Yes, it does exist but obviously the casino is still doing just fine.",OliverMonster1,2025-05-06T08:53:04,5
