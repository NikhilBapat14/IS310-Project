"This stupid man is trying so hard to find a demographic that'll like tariffs when the supply chain disruptions start. Everyone will be paying more and seeing less options, but Trump needs rich elites to message in favor of tariffs. It's a dumbfuck plan for dumbfucks.  Every time he talks about his signature move, putting tariffs on imports, it's a goddamned simpleton explanation that contradicts itself. Every time.",localistand,2025-05-06T21:59:24,24

"Is it me or does he still have an ax to grind against an industry where the overwhelming majority of stars rejected him as a joke when he was on The Apprentice and have rejected him as an authoritarian idiot during his political career? He clearly always wanted to be accepted as a star and Hollywood in the main wouldn't have it, so he's happy to try and burn the house down.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-06T22:24:43,2

"Some one may have pointed out to him that movies, not not being a physical good don't go through customs. Could put a tariff on DVDs, I guess. For someone who loves tariffs he really appears to not understand how they work at all.",econoquist,2025-05-06T23:36:34,2

"Don't forget in addition to wanting to be allowed into the NY Elite's circle, the Casino Elite's circle, he also wanted to be allowed into the Hollywood Elite's circle.

"Like i can kind of understand other tariffs, because it does make sense from a 5th graders standpoint how other tariffs might work.  You make it harder for people to import, suddenly more money Americans.  No need to go into details we all understand about why it doesn't work in practice.         But movies?  It's already like almost entirely American dominated.  It's probably our most important export globally because it pushes our culture onto the world and onto other countries.   Literally nothing to gain by tariffing it.",Lance_J1,2025-05-06T23:47:55,0

He has beef with literally anyone he thinks insulted him at some point in his life.  His entire first term was dismantling everything Obama's team had built simply because Obama made an offhand joke at Trump's expense that most people would have forgotten in a week had Trump not gotten so pissy over it.,ERedfieldh,2025-05-07T07:57:38,1

"Hey, I've seen what happens when you light the green candle!  Slowly, as the candle burns lower and lower, the Green Ranger loses his powers.  When the candle burns out then it is bye bye Green Ranger.  What Trump doesn't realize though is that the Green Ranger will not be gone forever, he will just evolve into the 5x more powerful White Ranger!  Its over, John Trump!
