"No, that's not really what the article is talking about if you read it. Actually, it doesn't mention voting at all. Because there's far more work, and really 99% of the work, that's done prior to election day that actually gets people to show up. And about the actual effective pushback to the administration that can be done *now,* long before election day.   It's about an actual Resistance lead by the Civic Society and is calling out members of that civic society, those who really have the most influence, who should be the ones speaking out and organizing and currently are not doing their part. Do you know who is in the civic society? The article explains...  I don't care how often I get downvoted for saying this, but people really need to read articles before commenting and just assuming they know what they are about based on a headline. Because it's how you learn actual information. And learning actual information is what incites people to act, teaches you what to look out for, and makes connections and revelations you wouldn't have made on your own since it informs you the specifics of what is going on.   Don't have a subscription? You can always use archive.is to read any article. While in no world can everyone read every article, a huge start is not commenting on articles you haven't read.",undercurrents,2025-05-09T20:11:18,2
