In a certain technical sense parts of it are true; but it's not the case that it was any result of Trump's policies being good or Biden's being bad.  In particular during Trump's presidency the economy had been on a steady uptick after recovering from the 08-09 issues all the way until covid.  Its steady improvement during that timeframe was not affected by Trump significantly.  Mostly I'd say it's a result of a well known fallacy in political science: people ascribe far more credit/blame for the current state of the economy to the president than the actual effects a president can have.,zlefin_actual,2024-08-15T09:35:32,45
Any discuss of this is going to start (and maybe end) with a massive footnote... because of COVID.  It torpedoed the economy at the end of the Trump presidency and the recovery made the first part of Biden's look like nothing before.  Accounting for that is often a debate on its own.,AuditorTux,2024-08-14T20:54:31,13

"The question is way too simplified.  First, you'd have to define [what metrics](https://www.vox.com/politics/24094752/biden-trump-strong-economy-2024-inflation) you're using to evaluate ""the economy."" GDP, unemployment, inflation? Or is it just perception?  Then there's the question of what's going on in general, both within the US and outside it. Is there divided government? A global pandemic? No two administrations are playing on the same field.  And underlying it all, there's considerable debate over [how much of an effect the US president even has on the economy.](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/02/05/how-much-control-do-presidents-really-have-over-the-economy/)",nosecohn,2024-08-15T17:11:05,3

The biggest factor of the market is the head of the federal reserve. Which you know what was the same guy under Trump as Biden. They both kept the same guy in charge.,MrNaugs,2024-08-16T00:45:21,1
"Congress, Lobbing, Money. No president controls any of those. Further, I have yet to hear a president or even a candidate make a statement that shows that he has any understanding of markets or finance.",Aruba808,2024-08-16T18:38:15,1
"Personally I don’t believe in making the rich richer so they might pay us a bit more. That’s the premise of trumps economic policy. I personally believe corps will be as greedy as they legally can so if you don’t force them to pay a fair wage and taxes, then the money will never “trickle down”.   I’d also say presidents are also beholden to congress and senate in terms of what they can accomplish and also COVID destroyed the economy and made the election a layup for Biden. That being said Biden didn’t do much for Americans, so I think people doubt Harris because they don’t see much improvement. I think both candidates got screwed by external factors and then their own age eventually. I just don’t personally trust a big businessman to take care of the poor, and you shouldn’t either. Why would he? He doesn’t have poor friends that’s he wants to help out lol. The guy hired an oil tycoon to run the EPA. I also disagree with republicans on abortion and forcing Christianity into public schools, as well as being obsessive about genetalia and trans people. It’s just really strange the obsession, I mean literally a GOP congress person in a random interview pulled out his photos and showed the reporter a trans blowjob… that’s right on air. Like you’re just wierd for having that on your phone.",Quinticuh,2024-08-17T15:51:26,1
The president doesn't affect the economy that much. Trump was president during very inflationary policy so the economy was good. Now we are in a stagnating economy it doesn't matter who's president.,Bigvardaddy,2024-08-17T17:36:06,1
"Total lie. Even the ""great"" economy ""before COVID"" was inherited from Obama. We were seriously crashing into a depression with over 10% unemployment from COVID (not to mention egregious death rates) before Biden took over.",tuna_tofu,2024-08-16T16:41:30,-1
"Oh for sure.....the economy is way more complex than ""who is sitting in the white house""......but for whatever reason this thinking persists forever. Sure, the president will have SOME effect on what happens, but it's not really in their control, as much as people would like to think it is.",noodleq,2024-08-15T18:24:36,4
">Accounting for that is often a debate on its own.  Yeah, I'd wager most people don't understand the economy enough to get a good feel for how COVID affected it and the future of the economy, let alone how a President could have affected it.",ProLifePanda,2024-08-15T09:05:05,5

"Trump cut taxes in every income tax bracket despite democrat lies to the contrary. He also significantly cut corporate tax rates. Corporations, especially manufacturing, reinvest most of their “profits” back into their facilities and product design which significantly stimulates the economy.  Think of all the jobs this reinvestment creates to make new products and build and maintain their  manufacturing facilities and production lines.   Both of these cuts significantly impacted the economy more than anything Obama did. Obama did nothing in his 8 years to stimulate the economy…if anything he delayed the recovery. Name one single policy under obama that directly improved the economy in a significant way.  This war on corporations by democrats is silly and misplaced. Corporations make millions of jobs and generate our economy. The government on the other hand does little but take and poorly and inefficiently redistribute wealth.   Billionaires tech company CEO’s vote for democrats while self created hard working  “millionaires” who own small local companies vote overwhelmingly for republicans. Think about why.",Dapper_Ad_6304,2024-08-21T20:47:37,1

"Go look at the tax rates. That is a flat out lie.   All brackets were lowered and the standard deduction went up as well as child tax credits.   The only people who saw their taxes increase were from very high property tax states that abused the salt deductions to lower their taxable federal income. Get upset at your state for over taxing your property, not at the federal government for lowering your federal income taxes.  You never should have been able to significantly reduce your federal taxes because you paid a lot in state taxes. The notion is ridiculous and goes against the Democrats mantra of paying your fair share. Why should you be able to stiff the federal government because your state taxed you a lot? Salt deductions are a joke. It let states run up massive property tax bills without penalty.",Dapper_Ad_6304,2024-08-22T07:30:29,2
">Most people got no tax refund and many owed.  I'm going to take a second and really squeeze down my CPA hat and explain why this is not the fault of the government in *any* way.  Not Trump, not Biden, not that dude down the street that goes on crazy political rants.  Whether you get a return or owe money is based solely on a comparison of two things:  1. What your calculated tax is (based on income, deductions, etc), and 2. How much you paid to the government during the year (whether through estimated tax payments, withholdings, etc)  It is entirely possible for your tax owed to go down but end up owing.  But that's not the government's fault, that's the taxpayer's.  And its *entirely* the responsibility of the taxpayer to make sure that they're withholding or paying their estimated tax.",AuditorTux,2024-08-22T11:35:08,1
