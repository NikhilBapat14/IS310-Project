So Trump is negotiating with terrorists?,BryteInsight,2025-05-07T01:29:55,9
"WHAT a shiz-show!  As with trade ""war"" with China, Trump unable to admit he lost.  Bragging about punishing Iran for Houthi strikes didn't help his Iran negotiations so ... he just lost that card.  Instantly tired of wasting money and equipment (1/3 of US fleet deployed on ""Operation Rough Rider""?) rolling rubble to 'protect' a shipping lane he doesn't care about, and with the losses only revealing how useless his DoD chief is (as if the world hasn't already seen that.)  ""Heckuva job, Hegseth-y!""  In his haste, Trump forgot to inform the Pentagon:  >On May 6, after the ceasefire had been announced, a Navy F/A-18 crashed off the deck of the Truman while attempting to land—the third Super Hornet lost from the carrier during its deployment. Both aviators in the aircraft suffered minor injuries, the Navy said.   .. AND Israel <BOOM>  * Deifullah al-Shami, a member of the Houthis political bureau told Al-Mayadeen television Trump's statement shows ""he wants to save face because of the failure of U.S. aggression against Yemen."" * Al-Shami said Trump ""is lying"" in order to get out of the situation he found himself in. ""Whatever he says — we will not allow any ship, any Israeli ship, to arrive to its port until the aggression against Gaza is stopped and the siege is lifted.""

"Seems like some details are unclear about what exactly the agreement covers. It might only cover US ships, which would not really be solving the whole problem.

"The problem is this happen over and over again. They strike the ship, US hit back, they agree not to strike again. But then it is just buying time because they need time to refill and regroup.

"Did you read the WSJ article? They've been doing this operation for 50 days, and UK joined, and the ship path is safe for now. Temporary stay, temporary truce.  From your own citation's article:  >Dubbed Operation Rough Rider, the campaign against the Houthis has drawn on U.S. Navy and Air Force warplanes and drones in the region, which have hit 1,000 targets and killed hundreds of Houthi fighters since it began March 15, according to the U.S. military. The strikes were ongoing as of May 5, defense officials said, and the Israeli military bombed the Houthis on May 6 for the second day in a row in retaliation for a Houthi ballistic missile strike on Tel Aviv’s airport, the Israel Defense Forces said.  And you said:  >Deifullah al-Shami said ""he wants to save face because of the failure of U.S. aggression toward Yemen  Are you seriously taking the Houthi terrorist's word? Guy, the U.S. was going after the Houthis, not Yemen. If the U.S. forces wanted to hurt Yemen, I'm pretty sure they'd be capable of doing so.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T02:28:02,-3
The truce doesn't include the Israelis. But the US and UK ships (should include UK since they're also now involved in air strikes) should be able to get supplies and trade through the Red Sea.,lady__jane,2025-05-07T10:26:15,0

(Reuters)  We're more worried about Iran - and they did immediately offer cooperation when Trump was elected, so that may be what he was talking about.

What part of any article or statement said ""the ship path is safe for now""?  THIS IS - at best - A BILATERAL TRUCE between Trump and Houthis (which BTW the US declared is a ""Foreign Terrorist Organization"").  PERHAPS retreating US Navy are ""safe"" -- there are ZERO assurances that the Red Sea or Gulf of Aden are ""safe"" (if that's what you are calling ""the ship path"").

"Um - most of what you said, I said. Are we disagreeing?  >THIS IS - at best - A BILATERAL TRUCE  That's the point of the article. We performed missile strikes for 7 weeks, then the UK joined us, and now our ships aren't bombed. A temporary stay is better than what we have had for a while.  >shut down Ben Gurion's main control tower with a hypersonic missile..  Yeah, that Houthi missile on Israel is a present from Iran. That's an issue. That's the main issue of all of this proxy war on the Houthis - and why this is posted as a ""heads up, people - shit may be getting real soon."" Iran is funding the Houthis, and Iran is creating nuclear weapons. Iran and co. are probably funding Hamas as well.

"? Rubio doesn't want to fight. He thinks the U.S. will have to defend Taiwan and so doesn't want to go into Ukraine and split the force in two. China has been arming in earnest for the last few years.  Most analysts believe we will ultimately need to remove the weapons from Iran - and will that be through war? Trump ordered a kill shot of the second in command back in 2020 to avoid an attack (from report). He didn't want a full fight. He doesn't want one now. What people believe is that there will be fighting to get the nukes stopped. If he can do it through talks only, he would deserve the peace prize he so desperately wants.  I stan Rubio as a person who can actually heal the country by bringing both sides together. I don't know of another Republican who can. I can't think of a Democrat who can right now - hopefully one will emerge.",lady__jane,2025-05-08T01:20:50,1

"More 'alternative facts'?  Trump apologists are really good at making things up as they go, it seems.  Didn't you just ask me:  >**Are you seriously taking the Houthi terrorist's word?**  Perhaps you should be asking **TRUMP** that same question?  THIS TIME you write how confident you are about TRUMP's truce with ""Houthi terrorist's word""  (your words)  And ""now **our** ships aren't bombed""?  So you figured out that ""THE ship path"" is NOT safe?  BIG DIFFERENCE between ""our ships"" and ""the ship path is safe"".

"> Has there ever been a case for American military action as strong as the case for our hitting the Houthis? Pick an ideology or worldview at random, and you’ll find that the cap fits.  Yet another conservative warmonger.who claims to see the flaws in prior US foreign policy while arguing for further mistakes  but can’t even recognise the basis of the Iraq war.  > Yet critics of the war — mostly but not exclusively Democrats — have also failed to face some inconvenient facts: that the war was not based on lies or malevolent motives, but rather on a good-faith effort to confront a significant if overestimated threat  > Yet understanding that **squandering the hard-won gains in Iraq** was also a blunder — and that **the dangers of overlearning the lessons of that conflict** are as grave as the dangers of underlearning them — is equally fundamental.

"Rubio was confirmed as Secretary of State [by all 99 senators present](https://people.com/trump-cabinet-nominees-confirmation-process-tracker-8775134). That's a feat. He was a senator and could have picked up some enemies but didn't. [This is a good BBC article on him.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg5kzk42xdo) I hope he considers running for president one day because we need someone both sides like. Democrats really don't like Trump. Republicans didn't like Hillary. Here's [Rubio talking about Cuba](https://youtu.be/cgWJztGsUd4?feature=shared&t=315) to the Senate - good guy.  Rubio (I assume) talked to the Houthis and worked out a deal where we would stop air strikes, and they would stop bombing. I don't know when we've had a similar agreement. They've been bombing our cargo ships.   Edit: They're also bombing Israel, but that's not yet part of the truce. That's another stage.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T04:00:23,-3
"Rubio used to be a decent guy, which is why so many senator's voted for him. Since joining the Trump administration, he's been busy backing up a lot of Trump's terrible acts, so he's no longer a good guy at this point and a lot of those senators have expressed regret over their vote to confirm him.",Moccus,2025-05-07T08:30:41,2
"Two - Chris Van Hollen and Chris Murphy - regret the vote. They expressed it again in March and May. They don't like the Ukraine issue. They knew Rubio wanted to end the Ukraine conflict - voted to do so back in 2024 because he said they were losing or at a standstill, so Ukraine needed to come to an agreement or lose the whole country. He didn't change that.  I'm not sure who else could make everyone happy or do the job so well. Trump will fire people who go rogue, though Rubio's acting in line with what he's said before. Trump doesn't want to get involved in a war - doesn't want one in Iran either. As of the January BBC article, Rubio said he doesn't because we need to keep main forces for the Taiwan conflict against China, and he sees China as the greatest threat.  >backing up a lot of Trump's terrible acts  Trump hasn't done any terrible acts overseas, unless you ask the Houthi terrorists.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T11:00:37,0
"> Two - Chris Van Hollen and Chris Murphy - regret the vote. They expressed it again in March and May. They don't like the Ukraine issue.  It wasn't just those two, and they weren't only concerned about the Ukraine issue. They've expressed concern about the gutting of USAID, the removal of people to a foreign prison without due process, and the revocation of student visas as a consequence of people exercising their freedom of speech/expression, all of which Rubio has been an eager and willing participant in.  > He didn't change that.  He's been out there defending Trump after Trump called President Zelensky a dictator and blamed Ukraine for starting the war, which is a complete reversal of Rubio's position from his time as a senator when he acknowledged that Russia started it.  > Trump doesn't want to get involved in a war - doesn't want one in Iran either.  He tried multiple times to start a war with Iran in his first term and had to be talked down by his subordinates. Now that he's surrounded by a bunch of yes-men, I expect he'll start one if the mood strikes.  > Trump hasn't done any terrible acts overseas, unless you ask the Houthi terrorists.  There's more to being Secretary of State than war, as I noted earlier. I would consider violating people's constitutional rights to be terrible acts. The USAID thing I would consider less serious, although it's certainly terrible for all of the people who are losing that aid, and the consequences of turning a blind eye to illegal impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds is potentially terrible if allowed to continue.",Moccus,2025-05-07T12:41:15,2
