"In theory, there is no upper limit except relative populations.  She could have ever voter in the blue states she wins vote for her and only get 49.9999% of the states she loses.  So long as the EV of the states she loses equals 270 or greater, she'd win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College and the Presidency.",AuditorTux,2024-10-31T08:32:34,1
"The absolute theoretical maximum would be to get 100% of the votes in all the big states and 50% - 1 of the votes in all the small states. I don't have updated numbers, but according to [this CGP Grey video](https://youtu.be/7wC42HgLA4k?feature=shared&t=259) it was 78% in 2012. Of course, this is an extreme edge case that would never happen in practice.  Edit: Actually, the *absolute* minimum would be if there were three or more candidates, one of them won 50% + 1 in Wyoming, no one else won a majority, and the person who won Wyoming was voted president in the House.",po1a1d1484d3cbc72107,2024-10-31T23:01:47,1
