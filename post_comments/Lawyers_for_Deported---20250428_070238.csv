"***From Lorena O'Neil for Rolling Stone:***  *As Marco Rubio insists two deported Louisiana mothers voluntarily brought their children with them, attorneys for the families say that’s a lie.*  Three U.S. citizen children were illegally removed from Louisiana and flown to Honduras last Friday, their attorneys say, in a story that has swiftly caught national attention.  Legal counsel for the two Louisiana families tells Rolling Stone that both mothers say they were not given the option of keeping their U.S. citizen children in the country. They say the mothers were told their children were being deported alongside them, despite their citizenship status and even though both families had lawful custodians willing to take custody of the children.

Of course they were. I'm sure they were told thst unless they took their children out of the country they would.be separated and their kids taken by the government.  They were never allowed to give the kids to another guardian.  ,MoonageDayscream,2025-04-28T07:20:13,32

"Somebody needs to ask him ""As both the child of a refugee, and the Secratary of State, what do you have to say to the innocent American Citizens fleeing persecution by the government IN THE UNITED STATES"".  I was having a discussion with my room mate about making sure we have our passports on us (at the very least) from now on while traveling between states, and this was both a perfectly normal conversation and CONCERN.   They're even a Mexican citizen so EXTRA FUN!! (and an American Citizen, and a German Citizizen....things get weird when dad's a mexican diplomat, mom's american and you were born in germany).  but thank fucking god they're white presenting.  WHAT THE FUCK!?",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-28T09:13:48,12
Rubio is a piece of shit. He was these kids. His parents weren’t citizens. They were cuban refuges.,Twodogsonecouch,2025-04-28T13:34:54,2
He's not the child of a refugee.  That's the disconnect.  He loves to pretend that his parents were *exilos*.  They left before the revolution and Castro took power.,DragonTHC,2025-04-28T09:56:39,11
"I saw a guy that use to do my yard work a few weeks ago, while out walking my dogs. He stopped and thanked me for encouraging him to get his US citizenship application submitted in 2019 when I also applied for mine. (In the USA for 55 years on a Green Card from Canada)  I was terrified Dumps would win again in 2000 and we would have all this shit happening then.  Thank god we received our citizenship before that Fascist became President again.",IRUL-UBLOW-7128,2025-04-28T09:58:37,5
No they weren't Cuban refugees. He loves to lie about it though.  They willingly left Cuba before the revolution.,DragonTHC,2025-04-28T14:51:25,2
