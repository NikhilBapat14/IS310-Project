no no no he has 200 trade deals for 195 countries,ElPlywood,2025-05-05T09:48:30,76
"But I thought that the trade hotline phone was ringing off the hook and everybody wants ""a deal.""  I would be absolutely shocked to hear that Trump may have been a bit dishonest.",I405CA,2025-05-05T09:49:50,30
What a loser. He literally could have stayed in bed and watched TV all day and he'd have a high approval rating.,30mil,2025-05-05T09:52:57,12
Trump is a colossal failure at this point. He torpedoed the economy without any exit plan.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-05T09:50:23,11
"It's been over a month and not a single trade deal. Wait until he finds out a single trade deal can take years, never mind trying to do hundreds of them simultaneously. The easiest one they should have started with was Heard & McDonald Islands. Pretty sure the penguins would have been happy with just a few more fish in exchange for dropping all of their tariffs on American products.",mkt853,2025-05-05T10:04:18,10
And he did get one big bill through. South Korea is selling their nuclear subs to Canada now.  Making Canada great again!,SwvellyBents,2025-05-05T10:04:42,9
but they said they had many!  Just wouldn't name names,2cigsaday,2025-05-05T09:50:55,6
"You guys don't understand him yet. The point is to provoke riots and foment rebellion which will allow the totalitarian control he wants to be put into place.  Destroying the US economy is the point. They aren't looking for deals or to make money, they are looking to create a fortress to escape accountability from all the enemies they have made. This goes for Trump all the way down to the lowly GOP supporter.  It's about trying to achieve control.",ShoppingDismal3864,2025-05-05T09:56:45,15
Or what?  He shits himself?    Thought out loud and answered myself.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-05-05T09:51:24,12
"The GOP Congress is kissing his ass and enabling him. The department of Justice is in his hands. Trump doesn't need shit, he's immune according to scotus.",Immediate_Concert_46,2025-05-05T09:59:28,3
"Here's the deal. I don't know what the deal is. There might be a deal, and it sure seems like a big deal, so the deal is, until there's a deal I won't know what the deal is, but once there is a deal I'll make a big deal out of making sure you hear about the deal. You know the deal.",FredUpWithIt,2025-05-05T10:03:55,3
"Hell, we're still just 2 weeks away from the best infrastructure deal, the repeal and replace Obamacare plan and the 10% middle class tax cut from the first Trump admin.  I'm holding my breath in anticipation of the greatness he's re-making Murica.",SwvellyBents,2025-05-05T10:02:19,2
I hope it hits zero so all of this piled up shit finally falls on him.,Toasting_Toastr,2025-05-05T11:15:58,2

Loser lol,Perpetual_change9009,2025-05-05T10:14:57,1
Don't worry folks. The biggliest deal will happen in 2 weeks.,antlestxp,2025-05-05T10:51:12,1
What kind of losers would vote for Trump? I blame those guys. You would’ve been stupid to ignore any of his actions from the past and think that he was the right guy for 2025 and on.,Forward-Weather4845,2025-05-05T11:22:45,1
The Presidential ass must be getting chapped from all the kissing.,Imacatdoincatstuff,2025-05-05T12:25:41,1
I’m sure he’s offered $1m to the leader of many of the countries that fall into the 10% tariff group. He’s bound to get a statement from them that they’ll import more Trump hats/Flags.,janzeera,2025-05-05T12:27:38,1
Ninety deals in ninety days! 200 countries begging for deals! Countries kissing his ass to deal with him!   Crickets.,ciopobbi,2025-05-05T13:20:44,1
he will just announce one,saxovtsmike,2025-05-05T13:58:28,1
Bingo,Sea_Coug,2025-05-08T10:02:13,1
Looks like he’s going to get one. China just backed down on its 125% tariffs this morning.,Batugal,2025-05-05T12:30:43,-2
it's just that those 200 countries don't know about it.,bickering_fool,2025-05-05T09:50:11,23
"You wouldn't know those countries, they go to a different earth",TechNoirLabs,2025-05-05T10:07:52,12
"Those penguins are looking to play ball, that trade deal will be ""yuge"".",Archer1407,2025-05-05T10:57:13,3
"Wait, what?   He’s the President of the United States. His is the commander in chief of the largest military on earth. He’s answerable to voters in a democracy, and I’d think even his most devoted supporters would be *pretty mad* if he was ever dishonest. Gosh!  If he was ever caught fibbing, our free and fair press would be taking him to task, and. he’d be held accountable and face real consequences.  It only makes sense.",Weekly_Rock_5440,2025-05-05T10:03:10,15
"Sorry, I can't talk on the phone I'm too busy kissing ass mmmm",MrVeinless,2025-05-05T10:33:46,3
"The problem is tariffs on ChapStick are preventing world leaders from kissing his ass.   For a guy who wrote Art of the Deal, a guide for every Boomer on Facebook Marketplace, he has a 50 year record of some of the worst deals ever.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-05-05T10:50:37,3
"Trump has an exit plan, for Trump. He’s accepting bribes through his meme coins. His chode sucking kids and washed up wife are all cashing in too.  So many self validated crimes committed, but Congress hasn’t done dick fucking squat.   We’re currently fucked.",industrial-complex,2025-05-05T13:07:17,5
"I don't know about that, penguins can be quite formal. I've never seen them arrive anywhere not wearing a tuxedo.",GeneralCommand4459,2025-05-05T12:44:44,2
"Actually they're ""selling"" it to Canada",White_Meteor,2025-05-05T11:14:55,2
"Nah, I thought this at first too, but I think it is pretty clear at this point these people took all their political ideas from right wing influencers and social media posts, and are just idiots that think they know everything bumbling their way through all this.    Pure incompetence and ignorance maskerading as malice.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-05-05T10:10:24,13
"It’s crazy to me that people can’t understand this. Destroying the livelihoods of the people who voted against him AND for him is the point.   They want political unrest so they can crack down and claim vast emergency powers.  The alt-right hasn’t spent years spreading fantasies about civil war to their most crazy followers for nothing. The rich doesn’t have a newfound fetish with building safe rooms and bunkers because they think everything is smooth sailing from here.   Speaking of the rich, they are all in on it, too. We saw them all line up behind Trump, and why wouldn’t they be? They laid the groundwork for his return. They were reporting record profits, meaning they were making MORE money than ever, but still claimed they needed to raise prices due to inflation. And the stupid fucks in this country lapped all that up along with the 4 years of propaganda convincing them that somehow it was the fault of Democrats in power. It wasn’t enough that our resilience powered us through a pandemic and the global economic effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We kept spending, we kept living, and we kept making the rich richer. But being richer isn’t enough for them, they want to own every dollar of wealth we create (meaning they’ll essentially also own every person too.)",ddark4,2025-05-05T10:53:30,3
Can you link me the source? Looking for it.,Extra_Toppings,2025-05-05T15:39:52,1
Those countries' leaders have all been reading fake news. Once they switch on NewsNation they'll realize they already signed the deals,gradientz,2025-05-05T10:51:23,3
"You don't know her, she doesn't go to our school",anonMLMhater,2025-05-05T11:11:19,2
He met them at summer camp on Mars.,BourbonRick01,2025-05-05T10:12:19,4
"Agreed.   For example, everyone would be really upset if Trump had promised to build a wall 10 years ago and never followed through.",gradientz,2025-05-05T10:53:43,3
You are correct! My bad! I'll edit my response. Thank you.,SwvellyBents,2025-05-05T11:19:37,2
We sent you a 24hr opt out email...we never heard back from you.,bickering_fool,2025-05-05T11:31:00,3
"I also seem to remember he said someone was lined up to pay for it...  Also, is next week infrastructure week?",WallNumerous3230,2025-05-05T12:25:07,3
