Because the secret service does not fuck around with threats and you don’t want to be sniped from a roof because of optics.   If you are arrested do not put up a fight. Do not say anything unless you have a public defender assigned to you or your own lawyer.

The reality is, this administration is weaker than it look, but it loves to put all of it's eggs in one basket and push. Add in that Trumps gang of idiots aren't smart enough to know that shooting tank rounds into a crowd of a million people is the fast way to a revolution and a very painful suicide for the soldiers involved. Things like fluid dynamics and 'crowd crush' get involved.  But if things go down that way, we're never putting anything like a country back together again. The bad blood will go so deep the various American Nations will be at war for each other for the next century. Probably longer. And yes, things can get worse. So much worse than you can imagine even now.   But without protests, we're fucked because the politicians need to be aware of the citizens as much as Trump.       So, the answer is to never provide Trump a opportunity where he is allowed to dream of the 'swift, decisive victory', where he feels he can just let the army loose and kill everyone. Massive protests in every city in the US? He can't and won't split up his forces enough to fight that. Too much of a chance of non loyal troops being isolated from the controlling infrastructure, too much of a chance of his precious military toys being captured and him looking the fool. He'll just hunker down, afraid, and pontificate as his mind goes.  The more he hunkers down, the weaker he looks.

"I don't really understand what you mean with ""not a single country on earth has total control"". Many totalitarian dictatorships have had near total control the last 100 years. You could argue that during the last 100 years more people have lived under the oppression of a totalitarian regime than in democratic societies with free speech.  There's no need for total control for total oppression. Fear is the motivating factor. If people are afraid there will be total control in a practical sense. I feel you have a pretty bad grasp of how a tyrannical oppressive society works.  It relies much on the populace oppressing each other to keep their own head down. I think maybe you are so used to having free speech that you have trouble imagining the possibility of not having it. But imagine a point where ""woke opinions"" are considered  treasonous. What are ""woke opinions""? Who knows? Whatever the powers that be consider uncomfortable.   Imagine if people who are outspoken start dissappearing. There are no courts to rely on for a due process because their function is to legitimize the oppression by playing along. Now imagine you hear your coworker say something ""unpatriotic"". What do you do? Do you inform on them? or do you put yourself at risk by interacting with someone you know harbor unamerican sentiment.  Now imagine your children are being tought in school that their loyalty lies with their country before anything else. They learn that it's heroic to tip of the secret police if they hear anything unamerican. They learn that they should even betray their parents if they are ""terrorists"" that want to destroy america. What do you do at home? Even if you trust your children, will you put that on them? Suddenly you can't even speak freely in your own home.  Then you get a ban on public gatherings. The libraries are being emptied from literature that might give you some thoughts of how a different society might look. Then search results are getting strange. History aren't described as you remember it, but everyone else is just playing along. Information you knew existed before arent avaiable to you anymore. People forget very fast and adjust just as fast you know. In a couple of years it's just normal to self censor.   Imagine if there was tools that could look through your entire social media and look for ""unpatriotic"" opinions. And the government has access to this (in america this is already true that the goverment have access to all your private data even though you aren't a suspect in any crime because of the patriot act). Now will you go on facebook to rant about Trump? No because you might dissappear for a couple of years to a work camp. Picking the vegetables that noone wants to pick or working in some random mine.  I realize I sound like I'm exhaggurating, but it has happened MANY times in other countries and there is nothing in the current state of the US that shows signs that there are any breaks what so ever on this development.

According to [Antonia Fraser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Fraser), the notorious story of the ignorant princess was first said 100 years *before* Marie Antoinette in relation to [Maria Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa_of_Spain), the wife of [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV), citing the memoirs of [Louis XVIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVIII), who was only fourteen when Rousseau's *Confessions* were written and whose own memoirs were published much later.[^(\[3\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake#cite_note-fraser-3) Louis XVIII does not mention Marie Antoinette in his account, but says that the story was an old legend and that the family always believed that Maria Theresa had originated the phrase. However, Louis XVIII is as likely as others to have had his recollection affected by the quick spreading and distorting of Rousseau's original remark.  >Fraser also points out in her biography that Marie Antoinette was a generous patron of charity and moved by the plight of the poor when it was brought to her attention, thus making the statement out of character for her.[^(\[13\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_eat_cake#cite_note-13) This makes it even more unlikely that Marie Antoinette ever said the phrase.",Condottiero_Magno,2025-05-06T14:17:04,20

"Ah, read it again. The first occurrence was in the mentioned bibliography of russou. But he wrote that while Marie was ten.  From another source (translated):  "" The cake saying can also demonstrably not be attributed to her. There is no evidence as to when Marie Antoinette might have said it to whom. However, there are many letters in which she speaks out on behalf of those in need. Finally, the sentence can be found in the memoirs of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau: ""At last I remembered the makeshift solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread and who replied: Then they should eat brioche!"" Rousseau wrote this in the 1960s, when Marie Antoinette, just ten years old, lived in Vienna, by no means a ""great princess."" The book was published in 1782, when Marie Antoinette was already under continued suspicion of wastefulness.   Other sources attribute the phrase to Maria Theresa of Spain (1638-1683), the first wife of Louis XIV. After the Revolution, Louis XV's daughters were married. with that in mind.
