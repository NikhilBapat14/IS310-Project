"Like yeah that's fucked up but I don't know I think 'legally' trafficking both illegal, legal migrants, and citizens to concentration camps and another country is a little bit worse though. 🤷🏼‍♀️",Murky_Rent_3590,2025-04-28T04:13:31,184
"Please actually read the article and not just comment something like, ""again?"" or ""so what else is new?""

"I think the problem with statements like this is it invites people to quibble. Is this really more corrupt than Spiro Agnew? Is it really more corrupt than the Tea Pot Dome scandal? We need to reframe these things. Donald Trump is the same thing he’s always been, a con man, a snake oil salesman, and a guy who gets off on fantasies of violence. What does that mean for us? It means he’s going to get us into a war while ripping us off. Noting he says when he’s on a charm offensive is true. Any time there is an opportunity to be violent to a minority male, he’s going to take it. Anytime there is an opportunity to sexually harass women and girls he is going to take it. Is he corrupt? Yes. But everyone knows that and a major party in the US still put him up as their candidate after he’d been found to have committed rape, defrauded kids with cancer and veteran’s charities, after he got undercover CIA personnel killed by giving their identities to Russia, after trying to rig an election. So, how do we get to Republicans?",t92k,2025-04-28T08:38:49,5
"Nothing will happen as a result of this. If charges were somehow brought against him, he will say ""I did it to keep the country safe."" SCOTUS will say, ""Oh you did? Okay cool. Carry on, nothing to see here.""  We are broken beyond recognition.",dumb__fucker,2025-04-28T06:52:53,12
"Our democracy is failing before our eyes.  Republicans sacrificed our democracy for power.  At no other point in history would Trump's blatantly illegal activities and breaking of norms be accepted by Congress.   Yet here we are, and Republicans are solely to blame.  They substituted actual principles and patriotism with ""owning the libs"".",joecool42069,2025-04-28T09:28:29,5

"I absolutely think Trump is a criminal and does not deserve to be in the White House. That being said, I cannot find an article that shows HOW his crypto scam is ILLEGAL. Most economists (and the average sane American) can agree that it is unethical, but what is unethical is not necessarily illegal. If Americans are to fight back specific laws need to be cited when they are broken. If anyone can point to the law broken, that would be appreciated.

These headlines are not going to move the needle. Trump is openly corrupt every day.  That is the strategy. He is flooding the lanes with corruption every single day.  It’s intentional so people get exhausted and it works so long as congress is also corrupt.  Any given morning with the Trump regime should end with impeachment and removal.  But republicans refuse to hold him or his henchmen in this regime accountable for naked corruption which itself is corruption and dereliction of duty for members of congress.,JDogg126,2025-04-28T05:56:18,29

"> In any case, articles are for reading beyond titles. You know, the learn actual information.  I'm going to disagree with you on this point. For any given issue, I typically read a few articles about it (more depending on the issue). Obviously, im not going to read literally every single article about each topic. So it's nice when a headline indicates the topic, so I can choose to read or keep moving. It's not about a refusal to ""learn"", it's about learning efficiently.   > Um, you literally have to post article titles word for word and not editorialize per subreddit rules.   True, but you can pick better articles. Even worse than the headline is the content. The sub-headline and the first 3 paragraphs dont even say what they're talking about, they're just teasing the reader and setting the stage.  So yes, I read the article and am discussing it.
