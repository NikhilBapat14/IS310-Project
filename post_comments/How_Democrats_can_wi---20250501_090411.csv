"Lolol. The level of cluelessness in this article is astounding. Do Dem politicians even try to find out what MAGAs actually say and believe?  I'm hardly an extremely online person, and I can't avoid reading one MAGA thought after another because I'm constantly bombarded with it.  What do these politicians do all day?  This is basic research into the opposition. If climate change was a big enough issue for GenZ MAGAs that it could move them, they would have already been moved.  GenZ MAGAs don't care about it or they think it's a Dem plot to drain their bodily fluids or something.",mlawus,2025-05-01T09:50:02,8

"The way things are going with this admin’s pure chaos and incompetence, I genuinely don’t think the Dems have to do much. They should have a huge blue wave in the midterms unless things materially change. People have over-analyzed the 2024 election way too much. People just wanted changed. I am highly confident the same thing will happen again in 2028. I’m not saying the Dems should sit idly, they should absolutely fight every second. All I’m saying is there shouldn’t be this crazy analysis and attempt to find the “perfect” message.

">One of the main reasons Obama won in 2008 was because he had a MASSIVE team of volunteers going door to door and to college campuses. He didn't assume that people automatically knew his policies, or that young people were already going to vote for him.  So did Harris, though? I'm really not sure where all this pre-election amnesia is coming from (in general, not just with you specifically). Like, it was being reported all across the board that she had a monumental ground game while Trump's was floundering. Going door to door and visiting college campuses were both on things she did extensively. She also didn't ""assume"" that people already knew her policies, she went out of her way to explain them at every chance she got and directed people to her website where they were all laid out in plain detail.  I think this is all a misinformation issue more than anything, especially post-election, because the fact that people even think that what you're saying was ever not the case with Harris is kind of telling.",AmTheWildest,2025-05-01T13:40:56,5

"Of course, she didn't call them ALL deplorable. That's not the point. Even Trump will qualify the insane things he says, but of course it's the soundbites that matter. When you run for President, you don't say things that seem to confirm the opposition's worst claims about you. You don't give the opposition inflammatory rhetoric to rally behind. I mean, you don't if you're not Trump. Trump voters were looking for any evidence that she and Dems didn't respect Trump supporters and were unwilling to listen to their concerns. Once she said that, it was easy to suppose that her administration wouldn't look out for them and listen to their needs. Any voter that was up for grabs who had similar needs that Trump's policies more directly addressed said ""screw it. He may be a liar but at least he wants my support."" And maybe you don't know Dem voters like I do, but the majority absolutely believed Trump supporters were low-class morons. It was just part of the discourse to mock those kinds of people. They may have thought that was a negligible minority of conservative voters, but of course they were way wrong. It was an alienating statement that still resonates. Any Dem that wants to win HAS to undo the perception cast by ""deplorables"". They have to have a candidate who can portray a respect for and comfort with those people. Newsome, for example, doesn't look like someone who can do that. See, enough of these voters just want to have their voices heard by the Dems.

"I know that Harris actually did have a way better ground game than Trump, and she did lay out her plans.   But maybe having way more behavioral scientists on the team would have helped, and better segmenting and targeting the electorate.   The misinformation epidemic is absolutely real, without a doubt. The DNC is working on fighting this as we speak, but they need to really draw from behavioral research and social science. This is one of the key things that helped Obama win both in 2008 and 2012. They can use it to their advantage for fighting disinformation, and getting people out to vote.
