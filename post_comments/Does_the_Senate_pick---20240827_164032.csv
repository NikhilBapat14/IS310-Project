[25th Amendment Section 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) specifies how to fill a VP vacancy.,NYSenseOfHumor,2024-08-27T17:37:27,8
"They do not.  Only a President, per the 25th, can pick a replacement VP. The President Pro Tem just presides over the Senate when the VP isn't around.  Though your logic does make a certain amount of sense. From the Washington administration until the Cleveland administration the President Pro Tem, since they perform the role the VP does when the VP isn't around, was the next in the line of succession after Vice President.  Curiously that original Succession Act called for a special election if the Presidency and Vice Presidency were both vacated and resetting the four year term based on when the special election was held.  But, no, the Senate can't pick a VP. From the election of Adams until the 25th Amendment if the VP became President or the VP died or resigned that office was just vacant.",federalist66,2024-08-27T19:16:41,2
You provide Article 1 but the 17th Amendment ended Senate selection of the VP and left it in the hands of the voters.,tuna_tofu,2024-08-28T16:53:35,1
