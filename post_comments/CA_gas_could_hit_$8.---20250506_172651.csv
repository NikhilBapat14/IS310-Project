"Well of they would stop insisting on only using the special California blend gasoline that is only produced at one refinery in the whole country and used the normal stuff the rest of the country uses, maybe they wouldn’t have this problem. Good lord am I glad I left that commie hellhole for free America back in 21.",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-05-06T18:00:10,40
Yet many of these people who flee CA will go to a Red State because of the lower taxes and better living then start working to pass laws and change the State to what they had in CA.  This is called insanity.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T21:49:31,11
"Democrats want higher gas prices because it's their way to push people towards electric, which is ironically worse for the environment.",RandolphE6,2025-05-06T17:44:32,42
"Don't worry, they're still in the process of outlawing gas vehicles. Despite the electrical grid not being able to handle it. At all. The lawmakers refuse to listen to the power company when they say ""No, the grid *can't handle it!*""  I wonder how long it will be until California's grid fails completely due to the obscene demand.",Nianque,2025-05-06T19:00:04,12

Poor fruitcakes.  They get the government they voted for.  ![gif](giphy|7k2LoEykY5i1hfeWQB),j3remy2007,2025-05-06T19:38:01,2
"Everyone reading this and about gas prices, if gas prices do not go down in your state or go up in your state or stay the same, then DO NOT blame the Trump administration that is your state government causing that, not the Trump administration. If they go up in your state, your state government did that and you voted them into office.   If prices do not go down in your state, that is because your state doesn’t want them to go down and taxes it to death.  DO NOT BLAME THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. IT ISN’T  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAUSING IT, IT IS YOUR STATE! THE STATE OFFICIALS WILL BLAME TRUMP BECAUSE THEY HAVE TDS!   “Over the last 30 to 50 years, the California state excise tax on gasoline has increased by 253%, the number of motor vehicles has grown by 38%, and our population has increased by 24%,"" Mische wrote..  235% because California doesn’t like you and is fine with $8.44 per gallon gas, ⛽️, why not round it off to $10.00 in Cali?    You voted for it in California by voting for the whackos that enact those laws, now pay for your gas.⛽️ a twenty gallon tank might cost you as much as  $180.00 in Cali!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-06T17:35:18,-6

">And further, Dems want chaos because they can always say it's somebody else's fault.  And further still, they want chaos so that people will eventually snap and be willing to give up their God given Rights, freedom, and liberty for a semblance of order and safety.
