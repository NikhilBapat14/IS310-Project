"I wish this was true, and would actually matter. But nobody will do anything. Their whole party is a dumpster fire with conflict and controversy being their motto. It’s like if the WWE had a political party. And your basic repub voter eats it up.   God I hate being this nihilistic.",Physical-Object8171,2025-04-22T19:44:01,7
"The rats will eat eachother, just like last term.  The revolving door of his new administration has started - only 100 days in.  The one thing you can be confident of working for a Trump admin is that you WILL be thrown under the bus at the first opportunity.  But hey, maybe you can write an insider tell-all book and make a mint after that happens",manwhowasnthere,2025-04-22T19:50:15,2
Im sure that he will soon pivot to being more Presidential.,centexgoodguy,2025-04-22T19:57:31,2
"Saw this coming. Me, on Nov. 15, last year: ""I’m trying not to laugh as Trump names his cabinet nominees. If I were given sway to name them myself, and my sole intent were to sabotage his administration from day one, I couldn’t do better.   It’s like this. You’re playing cards with someone, a real dummy,  bonafide loser, who keeps making a scene, begging to be allowed to deal himself his own cards from a deck that’s face up, and in the end, you look at his cards, and he’s smiling like a moron, laughing at you gleefully because he thinks he’s dealt himself a royal flush when it’s really just a load of crud because the only royal flush he knows is some tacky-ass gold toilet bowl in some tacky-ass gold bathroom in some tacky-ass hoighty-toighty type country club for insecure attention whores with unresolved achievement issues. And then you have to wonder how on earth all these toxic masculinity bros have come to associate a guy like this with guys like them. I mean, if they won the lottery and the next day moved into a place like Mar-a-Lago, and had their friends over for a visit, wouldn’t they laugh their tushies off?  So Trump is dealing himself one hell of a hand because this is what he’s wanted all along, absolute power, and a bunch of dipsticks ignored every sign - of which there have been thousands - that Trump was a perennial failure, and have now given him the power to bankrupt the whole world. And what has he done? Pfft. I know it sucks and that a lot of people are going to suffer badly, but take my word that I’m not laughing at that but at the fact that someone can be so dumb that when he finally gets to be the Fuhrer he’s always wanted to be, he sabotages himself better than his worst enemy could have. So yeah, it’s funny, and I’m laughing.""",SirsatShake,2025-04-22T20:00:53,2
"Fake news, everything is going terrifically well. The tariffs are already saving America! The glorious and brilliantly competent president is bringing back the American dream…… hey Pete… you really think they’ll believe this shit?…. Come on…. Really? What you mean it’s the truth? You fucking drunk again? …. Me? No you go fuck your self….",Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-22T19:37:48,2

"So Musk is right about at least one thing - Peter Navarro is an absolute idiot. Before joining the Trump Administration his only job was in academia as a professor at UC Irvine. Not exactly a powerhouse of economic thought leadership. And unlike pretty much every other top economic adviser of recent administrations, until the first Trump Administration he had never been a working economist, i.e., he only theorized and never provide policy advice that was actually implemented in the real world.   He is the walking epitome of the phrase “those that can’t do, teach.” ",No-Marketing-7515,2025-04-22T21:19:37,1
