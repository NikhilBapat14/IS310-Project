"As these cuts go into effect, I expect not only will work place injuries go up but so will industrial accidents. Poor storage of industrial chemicals and waste is literally powder kegs waiting to go off. Both urban and rural populations will suffer.",Khorondon01,2025-05-03T22:20:18,12

What workplace hazards?  Trump wants to bring back jobs with no workers comp benefits and no  obvious job hazards.,Expensive-Cap3159,2025-05-03T22:15:43,3

"Since my job is entirely focused on ensuring the health and safety of my employees and ensuring environmental stewardship, I, for one, am really excited about all these cuts. I hope they just remove all regulations and support systems. I can just sit back with my feet up while my team gets poisoned, and we pump whatever we want into the air and water. I mean, why would we want to go through all this trouble to actually PROTECT industrial workers? Psshh... this guy gets it. Yea.  /s",MushLoveRedDog,2025-05-04T08:24:28,1
"So, I'm guessing this is designed to slowly eliminate workers in those industries - to open up for all those white workers whose jobs were stolen by immigrants and minorities - so they can bring all their expertise and stellar work ethic to play in making America great again.",phosdick,2025-05-04T08:43:23,1
