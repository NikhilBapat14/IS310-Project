"Archive link [https://archive.is/3L4Bp](https://archive.is/3L4Bp)  >Trump said he would announce the supposed 200 trade deals in the “next three to four weeks,” but he seemed confused about whether the deals were actually done.  >“And we’re finished, by the way,” Trump said.   >“You’re finished?” *Time* asked.   >“We’ll be finished,” Trump clarified.  >“Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks,” *Time* said.   >“I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I’ll consider that, but I’ll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We’re a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history.
