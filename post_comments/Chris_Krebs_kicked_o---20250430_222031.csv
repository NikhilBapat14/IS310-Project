"> Krebs, a Republican appointee in his first term, received bipartisan praise for telling the truth about the 2020 election, which aroused the ire of Trump, whose lies about the election led to the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. On April 9, Trump signed an executive order instructing his government to punish Krebs in various ways, including ordering the attorney general to investigate him, though there is no evidence he has committed any crime.  > Time magazine recently asked the president if his order wasn’t exactly what he accused President Joe Biden’s administration of doing to him.  > “I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country,” Trump said. “I think he was — I think he was terrible. By the way, I don’t know him. I’m not — I don’t think I ever met him. … I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient.”  What Jake Tapper doesn't explain in this article is Krebs (the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under Trump 1st term) said the 2020 vote was ""the most secure in American history"". For that statement he was fired by Trump because Trump needed Krebs to lie to America so Trump could overturn the election Trump lost to Joe Biden.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-01T01:19:41,13
Not petty at all.  Chris should strike up a conversation with CSE-Cyber Security.  I'm sure he knows all the players there...,Postom,2025-04-30T23:02:22,7
