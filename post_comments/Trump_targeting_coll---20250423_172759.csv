"This is what the order directs: >  The executive order asks the secretary of education to “hold higher education accreditors accountable including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination for poor performance or violations to the federal Civil Rights Act,” the White House official told CNN.  > It also “directs the attorney general and the secretary of education to investigate and terminate unlawful discrimination by American higher education institutions, including law schools and medical schools,” the official said.",aleph32,2025-04-23T19:12:04,1

">The order, [first reported by the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/trump-accreditors-executive-order-universities-4e4366cc?mod=breakingnews), targets the federal government’s process for deciding what colleges and universities can access billions of dollars in federal student loans and Pell grants  Students wont be eligible for federal loans if they attend those schools. It's attacking indirect funding the schools receive through students.",SwimmingThroughHoney,2025-04-23T17:59:01,23
"Colleges are mostly run by states but are driven by federal funds and grants. If you have ever heard of a student needing to fill out a FAFSA it is a federal application for student aid; so Trump may not turn off college funding per se, but they can decline to fund the individual loans and grants for those students who go there.   Also, Trump doesn’t give a fuck about the law. He could sign an executive order and have it enforced at any level at this point because this Supreme Court is too chickenshit to stand up to his bullshit.",animalslover4569,2025-04-23T17:59:33,15

"Wait, so this means that if I pick a school that ends up losing its accreditation I won’t be able to access Pell grants, and my degree will be useless to get into law school?   So I’ll be taking out loans for a useless degree…",Candy_Stars,2025-04-23T23:40:06,2
