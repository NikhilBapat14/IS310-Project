"when israel is committing genocide, and people are opposed to genocide, it's not antisemitism. weird how an organization meant to have integrity and report facts seems to omit the entire story. i guess trump's shoes won't shine themselves.",IlllllllllllllllllI1,2025-05-07T12:36:46,1
It is not anti-Semitism when people are protesting against Netanyahu's inhumane treatment of Palestinians. It is humanism. Netanyahu is a criminal.,smithpd1,2025-05-07T12:53:27,1
Eliot Asher Cohen is an American political scientist. He was a counselor in the United States Department of State under Condoleezza Rice from 2007 to 2009.  Need we say more?,TintedApostle,2025-05-07T12:40:13,1
"The report is quite lengthy, and the blurb cited in the OP goes into no detail about it. The blurb vaguely references incidents of anti-Semitism but provides no quotes from the report or context (unless I'm only seeing part of it).  I don't doubt that there have been incidents of anti-Semitism on Harvard's campus. However, after the past couple years of pro-Israel voices declaring every criticism of Israel to be driven by anti-Semitism, I'm a bit skeptical that this blurb fairly summarizes the report.",def_indiff,2025-05-07T12:45:31,1
"just call it prejudice or bigotry.  all antisemitism means now is criticism of the israeli government. so it's becoming hard to known when an article is talking about actual hate, actual bigotry, or if it's just israeli propaganda.",Virbillion,2025-05-07T12:41:39,1
There is no anti-semistism at Harvard.  Why are they humoring Trump's charge of anti-semitism which he uses as a reason to pull aid? They should not give an inch to Trump's bullshit.,wizgset27,2025-05-07T13:07:54,1
"Israel and Biden dropped more tonnage per square kilometer on Gaza than any Nazi urban area sustained in 2000 days of Allied bombardment, in the first 200 days of their genocidal retaliation for Al-aqsa Flood (in which the Israeli military were the predominant killers of Israeli civilians per Hannibal doctrine invocation that weekend).",whatareyousomekinda,2025-05-07T12:41:44,1

i think it's more antisemitic to imply that the colonizer state that teaches its children to hate arabs represents the entirety of judaism. it would be antisemitic to allow war criminals to use an entire religion as a brand.  i've seen orthodox jews in israel be brutalized by the israeli police for protesting their government's actions. that's antisemitism.,IlllllllllllllllllI1,2025-05-07T12:45:29,1

"in the history of israel, more jews have lived in the us, only in the past few years has israel maybe got a slightly larger population of jewish people than the us. that is due mainly to religion in general being in decline.   so, yeah. i can only associate that word with israeli propaganda at this point.",Virbillion,2025-05-07T12:58:52,1
