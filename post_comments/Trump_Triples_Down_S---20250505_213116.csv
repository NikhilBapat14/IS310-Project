How about Trump and all the other billionaires go with fewer millions?  Stop the tariff war. Create a top capital gains bracket of 35% for the super wealthy. And a personal income tax bracket of 55%.    And an estate tax that eventually increases up to 90% for any estate worth more than a billion dollars.,raistlin65,2025-05-05T22:58:08,12
"Weren’t Republicans b1tching about shower heads, light bulbs, and gas stoves like five minutes ago? Imagine if any Democrat suggested what Trump is? I can just see Bernie or AOC being immediately labeled a communist if they said Americans will just have to get used to having less stuff or not being able to buy what they want. Remember when Republicans said Obama was gonna force everyone to live in a hobbit home and survive on bugs and tofu?",mkt853,2025-05-05T21:54:21,10

"So, for years now, the Republicans have been popularizing this idea that there’s a war on Christmas when stores advertise something as innocuous as holiday sales.

"He says toys, but is also less educational or stem toys, less clothing, less sports equipment. Less household goods for their parents and so on.

Trump Antionette slurs and word salads and destroys his way through every day and the GOP absolutely refuses to hold him in check but then they’ll go and *privately* say how upset they are and how scared they are for midterms.

"We’ve been steeped in individualism for too long. Too many folks are busy “putting on their own oxygen masks” (so to speak).  When the country was new, and even partway through last century, parents had a much higher chance of outliving one or more of their kids. It wasn’t any more pleasant than now, but at least in the backs of their minds they were surely aware that it might happen.  Comparatively, broadly speaking, parents of today seemingly go to great lengths to make sure their kids are far safer, more prepared, and better informed than the generation that birthed them. I infer that a lot of folks don’t plan on endangering what they have... be it their lives, property, or offspring.  “Giving unto Caesar while turning the other cheek and avoiding judging, envying, or aspiring to hoard wealth“ is also a plausible factor. How utterly convenient for an ever-present ruling class that Cosmic Santa for Adults waits to mete out final judgement after physical life is over, after the exploited peons can no longer rise up in protest.",Circular-ideation,2025-05-06T00:42:46,1
