"Not a terrible idea, generally - it can certainly be a bit annoying when someone tries to ""win"" a discussion with a reply+block (and I've been on the recieving end of such a block quite a few times), though what can you do aside from move on, and maybe put in an edit to the comment they were responding to to address a particularly egregious strawman they made in their final reply.  That said, it's a big site, not everyone is as civil here as other places, and there are definitely circumstances where blocks are warranted.  For example, there was someone I had to block maybe 6 months back because they were stalking me in every subreddit I posted to for several days, trying to endlessly continue an earlier (unproductive) discussion we had.  I don't see a problem with blocking in cases like that - I don't feel like I should have to put up with a person ad homming me and inserting themselves into any conversation I have anywhere.  Not everyone on reddit is looking to engage in good faith discussion.  Blocks are 100% warranted if you're being stalked, if someone is harassing you over your religion, gender identity, race, sexuality etc.  Report any TOS violations, but also block to stop the abuse, since it's not like admins respond to these claims instantly (though they do act pretty fast sometimes).  That said, I see no reason to believe at this time the mods here will be overzealous in enforcing this rule, so do what you will.",Zeydon,2024-11-08T14:46:32,5
"Ugh, thank you. The way the reddit block feature works is terrible, and I wish more discussion-oriented subs were doing this. (This is the first and only time I've seen a sub take a stand against it.) I refuse to block anyone because the way it works is just fundamentally wrong.",curien,2024-11-08T16:47:08,1
"I apploud this, why? Because politics should serve the population and is not by silencing people that you dont align with that you make politics.  Im tired of people blocking others and feel empowered and have a positive connectation. Is not, is walking away and avoid tought conversations and should be comdem highly condem, not praised.",Yvtq8K3n,2024-11-10T04:04:27,1
"It really is a crappy thing to do. I wish Reddit would change the way that operates. You’re in the middle of a discussion, and someone doesn’t like something you say, so they disagree vehemently, then block, and you have no ability to reply. It’s really obnoxious. Everyone should get a chance to respond once and then that’s the end of it. If that person doesn’t want to be notified, that’s fair, but to handcuff your ability to reply is rude.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-11-10T13:57:09,1
"Is abuse allowed? I have been an activist for a long time so I have hard skin when it comes to differing opinions, even when they are nasty but I feel like there are some circumstances where a block is necessary. Like I've experienced a sort of stalking where someone comments and attacks everything you say & the comments are not points of contention, they are just insults, like they're claims abt your personal life or you're crazy, stupid etc.",E-V_Awen,2024-11-11T06:58:54,1

That's a good point and I think falls under our ""if by some bizarre coincidence..."" at the end, I think this sort of thing would be easy to prove and would result in the stalker getting a permanent ban.",AuditorTux,2024-11-08T14:50:50,3
"Exactly that reply and block shouldn’t be allowed. Everyone should be entitled to one more reply, even if that person chooses not to be notified about it.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-11-10T14:14:44,1
">It really is a crappy thing to do. I wish Reddit would change the way that operates.  There's a reason every major social media platform has a block function and why plenty of places, like the EU, require it by law.  The alternative system that you're proposing is far worse.",HDK1989,2024-11-10T18:20:54,1
"No, it is not.  Please report anyone doing what you are saying and we will evaluate and ban if needed.",AuditorTux,2024-11-11T11:23:35,2
"This is very good and I think you could probably focus on handling this if such a case is reported during a discussion (where it's clear someone used the block in an unfair/dishonest way to ""win"" an argument), or if a person can report such a block from a past instance.  To narrow it down to such cases would probably be better than to simply look for any and all blocks, and then try to resolve the bizaare cases from there.  It's a slight difference in approach but I think it makes a major difference in resolving both concerns, as well as easing your work.",fletcher-g,2024-11-08T16:28:11,1
"Disagree.  If I wanted to use this as an object lesson, I would just disagree with you stating a bunch of incorrect information to back up my position and then block you. It’s really annoying.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-11-10T20:45:51,1
"In this case, the user posted their response and another responded, including additional citations.  *Exactly* what we want here.  Rather than engage and debate, the first user decided to block.  Absolutely *not* what we want.  We'll deal with it on a case by case basis, but if someone does the reply-block approach, they're gone.",AuditorTux,2024-11-08T20:20:43,1
">It’s really annoying  I don't disagree, but the prevention of targeted harassment always has to be first when it comes to social media.  This is a public forum, but you do not get access to me if I don't want you too. As soon as you abandon that principle the worst people act in the worst ways.",HDK1989,2024-11-10T21:18:02,1
"Yes I've had someone do the same to me on another sub, the democracy sub (and even on Facebook they do that a lot, and funny enough I've only noticed that from fellow Americans), so I understand.  One guy in the democracy sub in particular often posts false info and arguments that are very easily refuted by anyone knowledgeable on the subject. But he doesn't want his comments corrected with facts, evidence or fair argument. So in order to have the last word with no one ""able to counter him"" he'd just block such a person.  So it's a really good call you made, I haven't seen any other mod make that call, I thought it was brilliant.",fletcher-g,2024-11-08T20:36:18,1
"So, if a person wants to block, then they should be allowed to block.  If they want to reply and then block, the blocked person should be allowed one more reply.   That’s not targeted harassment, it’s preventing someone-an immature person-from leveraging tools to cheaply get the last word.   I’m quite confident there’s more of that nonsense happening than targeted harassment, and if there’s harassment-true harassment-surely the person blocking wouldn’t want to make one more comment before the block.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-11-10T22:21:25,1
