"As Pope’s go, he was a pretty good one.  Hopefully a turning point in the ugly and hierarchal aspects of the Church.  His message stands, despite the history and the hypocrisy.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-28T12:33:24,36

"The Pope had a few words about compassion relating to GAZA, as I recall.  Did Genocide Joe  forget?  >""the defense must always be proportional to that attack.""  >""When there is something disproportionate, there is a dominating tendency that goes beyond morality,"" he said.
