"Growing up near The Georgia-Alabama border, my dad always joked the welcome signs said ""welcome to Alabama, set your watch back 50 years"". (The state border is the eastern/central timezone)... Oh the irony of my dad being a stubborn Republican.",O918,2025-05-01T20:47:56,4
"So other, natural citizen, workers complain about low pay and hard work... and your response is you want to make undocumented immigrants to be your labor force since **YOU** can scam them with low wages and long hours for these difficult jobs?  You either need to focus on improving wages for these jobs or improving the US citizen intake process to naturalize more citizens at a faster rate. What you are suggesting is racist and wrong ""yeah let the at risk and undocumented workers do the work others don't want to!"" Signed -@williamgman",Ryno_D1no,2025-05-02T01:17:06,2
Don’t. I’m a Bama alumni and all these folks know exactly who and what they support. They think it’s funny. Of course this is not every Bama student/alumni but Trump chose this school for a reason. He knew he would be welcomed.,Motor-Explanation851,2025-05-01T22:36:16,7
