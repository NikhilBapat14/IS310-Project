The church actually means it. They’ve had this fight before with other governments (ironically the Nazi Regime in Germany being one of them) and they didn’t back down then either. These laws will take a real hit the first time they try to prosecute someone because the priest will refuse and end up in jail and the church has enough resources to make the legal and public battle very problematic for the government.,deadzip10,2025-05-07T17:09:29,199
"Religious confessions are traditionally privileged information, seeing as how people won't do them otherwise *and part of a priest's private sector role is steering people away from wrongdoing.* This law just means there's going to be a conflict between the state government and (**one**) religion, if the state gets their way then what priests do with followers in the confessional booth will just grind to a halt.  Immediate government machine output -> there's going to be drama in courts for a while.

"I don't see how this wouldn't be challenged and overturned in court as a violation of the 1st Amendment. In spite of the negative headline, the Sacrament of Confession has hundreds of years of precedent. The Sacramental Seal prevents any priest from disclosing, talking about, or revealing the contents of what is said in the confessional. And you can say that it's not right or dubious, that priests should have a moral duty to come clean, but this is a clear and cut case of a violation of freedom of religion and the State prohibiting the free exercise thereof.  And to see ""fellow conservatives"" arguing for the State to dictate, control, and target religious practices is not what we should stand for. Making the arguments that protecting the free exercise and practice of religion is enabling criminal behavior is an attack I would expect from the left, not the right.",MetallicaRules5,2025-05-07T14:54:27,56

"It always seems a very tough place to be in as a Priest. On one side, you have your obligations and vows to God to NOT report anything. Confessional is Inviolate. But on the other side, your conscience has to deal with it.  The left constantly harps about separation of Church and state and now they, the State, is trying to FORCE Priests to violate their Obligations and Vows to God.  In regards to the State, that sounds very hypocritical.  And it is long been part of the Church that violating the Confessional DOES and HAS always had the penalty of being excommunicated.  I would hate to have to make this decision and I am not Catholic.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-07T12:14:14,57
"Stupid law and the only way it could be enforced is if the state deliberately sets up a priest via entrapment. Confessions can be done anonymously and the penitent does not confess names and and exact details.  If a priest hears an anonymous confession, unless he recognizes a distinct voice he will have extremely limited details that wouldn't be of much help in an investigation.  The other side of the coin is that if someone is confessing to such a crime then they are likely truly penitent and are willing too go to the police, which the priest can encourage.   To truly enforce the law, the state would need to send people into confession, note which priest was performing confessions, and then have them charged if they fail to report a crime with practically no details within the time they are required to confess.",ChewieWookie,2025-05-07T16:46:09,18

"No, the Church provides no exceptions or liberties. Once the confession is over, the sins are either absolved or not (very rarely does a priest not absolve and certain criteria would need to be met such as how repentant they are).

Can’t happen to us Catholics, because our priests are bound by vows to God to never reveal what they hear in the confessional. Priests act *in persona Cristi*. It is Christ who is present with them and grants absolution of sin through them when a penitent seeks reconciliation. The thing about Christ’s mercy is that it is extended to all men, no matter how evil.

This is not true, they specifically stated that their reason for blocking is to not be labelled something they are not, because this is obviously an emotionally charged topic for a lot of people.",DannyDootch,2025-05-07T14:56:21,29

So you agree confession to disciples and to Jesus is biblical. Confession to priest is not.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-07T15:38:22,-8
"No.  They just recognized you had no intention of debating in good faith.    Your intention from the start was not to get to the truth of the matter, it was to portray them in a bad light... Because you've already decided what you think the truth is, so you have no intention of listening to his arguments in good faith.  And you would not hesitate to bend the truth, misrepresent, or straight up lie, to accomplish that goal, because your purpose here isn't related to the truth, since you've already decided what is true before anyone else even opens their mouth.  **Making them look bad for disagreeing with what you've already decided is true before he even say anything is your only reason for being here.**   **You are not here in good faith and they are absolutely in the right for not giving you the time of day because of your malicious intent.**  **You don't want a debate, you want a fight... And just because he wants a debate instead of a fight doesn't mean he can't debate.**  And that said, we're done here before I get drawn into a bad faith argument with you.",Shadeylark,2025-05-08T07:50:30,0
"No, I don't agree. They handed that authority to their successors. We see that when they replace Judas.  We see that with Linus succeeding Peter in 2nd Timothy. Jesus didn't abandon His Church at the Ascension.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-07T15:49:58,21

You said he gave that power to his disciples.   You said not only catholic priest are disciples.  So it cannot be true that you must confess to catholic priest.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-07T15:55:42,-4
Where in the Bible does it state this? I understand there are lots of Catholics and they believe this I am asking where is it in the Bible. I have lots of comments and downvotes but no scriptures? funny how the Catholic Church operates isn’t it you think it would be super easy to link scripture to back it up.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-07T16:00:27,2
"The power to bind and loose, they used their power to bind to pass it on and gave authority for it to be continued passing on. That's why the 266 successor to Peter is going to be announced any day now. It never stopped.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-07T15:58:44,6
"We are all called to be disciples of Christ. But priests in particular are the *successors* of the *apostles*.  Jesus had many disciples, but only twelve apostles. And while we are obviously called to let the example of the apostles guide us as laypeople as well, the apostles shared their *responsibilities* that they got from Jesus himself with select people and transferred them to their successors.",Borcarbid,2025-05-09T05:42:40,0
"You keep asking ""Where in the Bible"" but that's already been answered, you've literally been given the Scripture passages. And since is the Bible the ONLY doctrine regarding the Church? You have Canon Law, the Magisterium, various councils, and thousands of years of theological writings that have enumerated this.   As Conservatives, we believe in an originalist interpretation to the Constitution. But we also look at the writings of the founding fathers outside of the Constitution to understand and interpret it for the areas that are not as well defined and to answer legal questions. Canon Law and tradition has been built up on similar beliefs from Jesus' actions and words.",MetallicaRules5,2025-05-07T17:16:59,8
So you are back tracking and only priest can be disciples now?  Still waiting for scripture that’s says you must confess to priest.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-07T16:02:06,2
They linked scripture that said nothing about priest because it IS NOT in the Bible. There is nothing wrong with going to a priest for confession but to claim something is biblical it needs to be found in the Bible. Tradition is fine but that does not make it biblical. Like there is nothing wrong or sinful with playing baseball but it’s not biblical.,Hobbyfarmtexas,2025-05-07T17:32:11,6

"I have not  backtracked, you're just asking the same thing over worded differently.  I've given you scripture even though sola scriptura isn't in scripture.  The magesterium and Tradition also have authority.     I'm sorry I don't see this progressing in a positive manner and honestly don't want to bicker with someone who isn't engaging in debate/discussion in good faith.",NotRadTrad05,2025-05-07T16:09:26,9
"You're obviously not a Catholic.  While scripture serves as the basis for all church law, church law encompasses much more than what is in the scripture itself.  From papal ex cathedra decrees to Cardinal law, the church interprets scripture for lay members of the faith.  There is church law that does state that only a priest, or some other *ordained* member of the clergy, can administer the sacrament of confession (also known as the sacrament of penance, or the sacrament of reconciliation)  Just like how only a priest can perform the sacrament of the Eucharist, or the sacrament of matrimony, in spite of there being no clear scriptural prohibition against lay people doing so, or any of the seven sacraments.  Specifically, cannon law 834 and 861.  If you think an ordained priest and a lay person are the same, fine, that's your belief.  But it is not a Catholic belief.  **And you have no right or authority, either legally or spiritually, to compel anyone else to violate their spiritual beliefs in order to better align with your own.**  You can disagree all you like... But the beauty of the 1st amendment is that your disagreement with the practices and beliefs of my faith does not grant you the authority to tell me I cannot practice my faith in accordance with its beliefs and practices.  Edit: and I'm going to leave it at that, because I have no interest in either a) converting you, or b) submitting my religious beliefs to your unsolicited scrutiny.  2nd edit: because I saw some of your other comments I feel the need to clarify something.    As a Catholics, we believe the gospels e.g. the Bible, were written by *humans* acting under divine inspiration.  This is opposed to, say the Muslim belief that the Quran is the literal word of God spoken by the prophet.  So when you keep saying *it's not biblical* nobody is disagreeing, but as Catholics we say that there is more to God's plan than the narrow interpretation of events recorded in the gospels by the mortally-flawed apostles, and thus the Church finds its purpose.  There are sects of Christianity who believe that all of God's plan is encompassed within the gospels and therefore there is no need for church law to interpret the scripture.  But, do not try to make Catholics agree with that statement, because that would be asking us to commit heresy.",Shadeylark,2025-05-08T07:02:00,2
