"That article can't be right. Everything I've read here on Reddit has told me the next 100 days will be:  \- Rounding up all the alphabet people and putting them in Gitmo.   \- Arresting judges for no reason other than they disagree.    \- Deport or send to Gitmo any US citizens who disagree.   \- Still going to be declaring martial law, even though he never did it on 4/20 like we said prior to 4/20   \- Cut grandma's social security checks by at least 1/3   \- Invade Canada and Greenland.    \- Ruin everything.",PartyOfFore,2025-05-03T17:36:55,48

This administration will do AMAZING THINGS if they focus on 100 days at a time. They will accomplish a tremendous amount of things if they keep that mentality. Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can accomplish today.,VerusPatriota,2025-05-03T18:27:13,3
