Quote: Prime Day is losing its luster among a critical group: sellers.  Some third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods during Amazon's premier July shopping event are sitting it out this year or reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they offer.,DrThomasBuro,2025-04-28T10:04:29,13
"Unfortunately there's going to have to be pain for people to understand the magnitude of Trump's damage.    What we've seen so far have been anticipatory changes in value on Wall Street.  What's coming next are jobs reports, earnings reports and price inflation as the Find Out phase begins.    If people are telling pollsters that they're unhappy with his handling of the economy **now**, just wait until the shit hits the fan.",Searchlights,2025-04-28T10:11:10,10

Time for Bezos to buy some more Trump meme coin to get these tariffs lifted.,AllynCrane,2025-04-28T10:37:54,1
You do realise that most of the shit in your country isn’t *made* in your country? How do you buy local to avoid tariffs when you want a laptop dock but have to make do with a pumpkin?,lepobz,2025-04-28T22:54:23,3
