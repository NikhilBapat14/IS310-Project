Let's be real: he doesn't even understand what he's saying half the time.   He's so senile I doubt he actually understood the question he was being asked.,GhoulLordRegent,2025-05-04T11:47:09,1

He has zero integrity. That oath meant nothing to him.,TasteTheBizkit,2025-05-04T19:10:05,1
He is not a king.  He is a convicted felon who is corrupt af.  People like Don the Con do not need or want the Constitution because it impedes their corruption.,ResidentKelpien,2025-05-04T11:49:52,3
I would argue that he has been very certain. He’s just lied in the past because he knew he was supposed to say that he would uphold it,Lysol3435,2025-05-04T12:58:08,2
"While we shouldn't ascribe malevolence to what could easily be seen as incompetence, we have to remind ourselves that this man ran multiple successful campaigns for the President of the United States.  He had previously stated that should he run for President, he would do so as a republican because they are the dumbest voters.  This is the man who successfully committed Treason by calling forth a group of people to overthrow the Constitution over a job he didn't get.  This guy right here successfully argued that the President of the United States is immune to the consequences of violating the law.  This person who bankrupted themselves multiple times managed to accrue and maintain enough money from domestic and alleged foreign donators to be able to know beyond the shadow of a doubt that his actions would be manipulating the stock market.  This guy right here successfully embezzles millions of dollars from the federal government every weekend, laundering it through his own business, just by playing golf.  This person stated from the get-go that he would act as a dictator and is being granted a military parade in his honor.  This guy created an alleged form of bribery through creating and manipulating his own fiat currency.  This fucker, Donald J. Trump, decided that he needed to obstruct justice and demanded that Congress obstruct it for him, and instead of passing a reasonable budget in a timely manner, the house of representatives obeyed him and went home.  This guy, who says mean things on the internet about judges, and they face death threats as a repercussion.  This man, who has been convicted of fraud and over thirty other crimes, I allege to be successfully Defrauding the United States. This is seen through publicly available information.   This guy right here has sentenced people to life in prison simply because he wanted to.  This guy, still, Donald J. Trump is succefully commiting Contempt of Court against the Supreme Court. He is dunking on these fools who refuse to have him face the repercussions of his actions.  This guy put one of the richest men in the world, known for his cruelty to his employees in charge of how to fire people.  This is the person who decided to abuse the office of presidency to retaliate against everybody who has been perceived to have slighted him.  This is the guy who signed an executive order that states people born in the United States aren't citizens because their parents were here illegally and therefore not subject to our laws.  This person publicly stated he could murder someone in broad daylight and still win the election.  This guy who replaced the secretary of defense with an entertainment personality.  This motherfucker uses an unsecured phone application to plan wars to get around documentation laws.  This guy knows he's supposed to enforce the Constitution; it is a core component of preserving said document. He is not incompetent. He is extremely competent at committing his crimes. So far, he's gotten away with every federal offense he's performed and even escaped his sentence for the state felonies he has been convicted of.",BananasAndAHammer,2025-05-04T14:29:10,1
"""It's a beautiful thing, The Constitution...it's so important and special to the people of our country. It really means a lot. It's right there in the name: 'Constitution.' It means we 'constitute' some things, and we 'shun' other things.""",KyotoGaijin,2025-05-04T12:16:20,6
