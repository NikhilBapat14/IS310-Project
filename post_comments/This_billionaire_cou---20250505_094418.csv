">What’s so special about Pritzker? First of all, and most important, he’s more clear-eyed about Donald Trump and the Republicans than many in his party.   >Around the start of the president’s second term, when many Democratic politicians were rejecting the idea of another sustained resistance, Pritzker was already anticipating that Trump would govern in an authoritarian way and promising to be a bulwark against him. Others in the party now sound more like Pritzker did three months ago.  >But even as the administration destroys federal agencies and ignores judicial rulings, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, both Democrats from New York, have to be begged by activists to say or do anything really aggressive.  >Not Pritzker. “Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now. These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” the governor said in a speech last week in New Hampshire.  JB Pritzker’s speech in New Hampshire, April 27, 2025   https://ericzorn.com/jb-pritzkers-speech-in-new-hampshire-april-27-2025/   >So when I was here about eight months ago, at the AFL CIO Labor Day breakfast, I laid out the bleak situation that we would find ourselves in if Donald Trump returned to the White House. Now, well, here we are. I gave it to you straight last year, and I’m going to give it to you straight again tonight. ***In this fragile moment, the direction of this nation will turn on who we choose to listen to, whose stories we decide to tell about what is happening, who we elevate and who we ignore, who we find noteworthy and who we label as just noise. Who we listen to will shape the way we react to events as they unfold***.",tech57,2025-05-05T09:57:03,53

I like some of the stuff that Pritzker’s done, but it shouldn’t be forgotten that he’s a billionaire who had all of the toilets in one of his houses removed so that he wouldn’t have to pay taxes on it. You don’t become, let alone stay, a billionaire without having a deeply unhealthy relationship to wealth—there’s a reason why billionaires are driving climate change so heavily.

"Um, no one is ever going to ""bring back jobs to America"".  Trump and his tariffs aren't going to do it.  Good paying jobs with  benefits don't have to be done in factories.  Unions can have a role in elevating the standard of living in human centric positions, particularly services where they have already had an impact.  American workers are too expensive to produce products at a competitive price for the markets businesses want to sell to.  Since the 70s and 80s, workers have been replaced with automation where possible, shrinking the number of factory jobs that need humans to work.  If a job can be done by someone without an education, it's done more cheaply abroad, wherever that may be.  An awful lot of money is being spent to create human-equivalent robots that work 24 hours a day at a price much cheaper than an American worker.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-05T10:18:57,4

As far as the notion of  “wealth = inherent authority” , well that means more to the maga crowd than me.
