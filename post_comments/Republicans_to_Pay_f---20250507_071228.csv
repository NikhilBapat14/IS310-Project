I live in Idaho and lived in Texas. Almost all recreational land in Texas is privately owned.  Game wardens are always writing trespassing tickets to folks hunting and fishing on private land.    Idaho briefly did this and the buyers were rich liberals that closed off access thru their property to public land. That pissed everyone off and caused the State to get involved.   The local rednecks think they're going to be able to afford untouched wilderness and I just laugh. Arnold Schwarzenegger would buy up most of Sun Valley and all of Mount Baldy and close it off to everyone.   Henry Winkler comes to Idaho to fly fish.  He has a blast. He could buy petty much all land made available and still have money left over.

In all, the committee’s legislative package would raise more than $18 billion through increasing federal oil, gas, and coal lease sales as well as timber sales and other means.

"This has been part of the plan since his first term. He appointed an oil industry attorney and lobbyist to head the Dept. of Interior. They appointed a guy to head the BLM who not only has strong ties to oil and gas associations but who also wrote multiple books calling public lands a scam. He moved the Bureau of Land Management HQ from Washington DC to Colorado where it literally shares a building with Chevron and other energy companies. A massive conflict of interest. This is the game. Take our land that belongs to us and let someone else profit off it and we don’t see a cent. It won’t even make oil and gas cheaper.   Then there’s issues like what people are facing in Montana. Ultra wealthy people and venture capital firms doing land swaps with the government. The Crazy Mountains is a recent example. It used to be public recreation for all kinds of activities in that beautiful range. Now it’s restricted and privately held. A resort. Then there’s The Yellowstone Club in Big Sky. It too used to be public land. How’d it happen? Big money will buy some absolute dog shit public land in some shit area with nothing to offer. No water, no mountains, no growth, no game, no access. Then they’ll “lobby” a government official to swap that dog shit plot of public land with the good public land they want. The acreage is the same so on paper it looks like a fair swap. But for the Crazy Mountains and Yellowstone Club, the land it was swapped for wouldn’t have made the billions that the current land does.

No, he did not roll back the continuing growth of inequality, but he *did* do far more than any Democratic president since the 60s to protect labor and redistribute wealth. And in a democracy, even a failing one, this is what we always have, compromises and choices. If your choice is between Biden and Obama/Clinton for the working class, you can point out how feckless Biden was, you can point out how none of these are good choices, while still realizing that voting for him would be preferable to the other two.  And the exact same can be said about the Democrats. They are a terrible, terrible party that is almost entirely in the pockets of the rich. But their political opponents happen to be worse.

Written in New York in 1940 and first recorded for Moe Asch’s Folkways Records in 1944, “This Land is Your Land” evolved over time, dropping verses protesting private property and poverty after the war in favor of a far more patriotic tone.

If these aren't worth fighting for...what is?  If you're waiting for the line, where is it?  I've asked a lot of Americans here ""Why aren't you all protesting? Why do other countries get 5-30% of their populations in the streets but you can't even manage 1%"" and they tell me ""I have to look after my kids!"".  This isn't looking after your kids.  This is dumping all these problems on them.  So they'll have to grow up and protest under a more tyrannical government and make more difficult choices.  You're literally making your life easier and your children's life harder.  And still nothing.  I'm tired.  It won't do anything.  That's what they want.  I'm busy.

Once the taxes are gone, they're never coming back while the GOP holds office, and unlikely to come back while the Dems hold office (if we don't go full fascist).  Dems know *raising* taxes scares away the middle and neolibs, so only the actually progressive ones want to do it.  In the end, the GOP knows they win on messaging when the Dems try to raise taxes (even if it's only on the ultra rich).     Anyways, *because* the GOP will never raise taxes back up, but we suddenly lack funds, it will then be an excuse that we ""have to cut services."" It's all self perpetuating by the GOP.  They never lower the debt¹, they just campaign about how bad it is.  DOGE supposedly cut all this stuff but never once floated actually putting those savings towards the debt - because they want rich tax cuts instead, always.  And to distract, they talked about sending a check to everyone (that would disproportionately go to the rich). Because cutting services and then pledging those funds to debt reduction over decades means you can't cut those taxes.   So we get this loop of cut taxes - oh, not enough revenue?  Cut services. Surplus from cutting services?  Cut taxes.  Repeat until they've fully destroyed the good that is public investment and servcies, and privatized for profit so much of what was once public.   Watch.  When tariffs revenue isn't high enough next year - AFTER they've forced through trillions in rich tax cuts that they're on record about being determined to push through this year - they'll say we don't have the money, er can't afford Social Security anymore, or Medicaid/Medicare.  Or they'll sell the Postal Service off to private interests.  Mind you, they'll do all of it, it's just a matter of which they're going to do first.       ¹*To be fair, no one pays down the debt, it's not valued at the ballot box because there's no tangible benefit.  Just taxes that suddenly disappear in math and only chip a small amount of the debt.  It NEEDS to be done but, everytime we run a surplus, one party says tax cuts while the other puts more into social programs. No one ever pays the bill and that's why we're projected to pay $952 Billion in interest this year.  It is likely next year we'll break $1 Trillion a year in interest, which makes everything Musk broke to save $5 end up even more worthless.  We have to tax the rich and the large companies, they took that money through gains without proper taxes on them due to GOP fuckery.  They need to pay down the debt, not just service the interest, through permanent taxes until it's paid down.*",DebentureThyme,2025-05-07T16:33:57,1

This proposal deeply concerns me. Public lands are an essential part of our country’s natural legacy, providing recreation, supporting local economies, and preserving vital ecosystems. Selling them off for short-term fiscal reasons—especially to fund tax cuts—sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the public good.

"A few things of note here:  1. You're right about billionaires wanting to balkanize the US. They see it collapsing and want to be able to set up Corporate City-states of their own, reinventing both the company town and feudalism but to a corporation.  2. American apathy has been slowly trained over the past 50+ years, beginning with restricting protest rights and arresting and killing protesters back in the 60's and 70's for being against the Vietnam war.   3. The people who are ""too busy"" sometimes really are too busy. The system is designed to make people uncomfortably close to insolvency all the time so that they cannot take risks. A majority of Americans still don't have enough savings to pay for a major unexpected expense. The expectation is to go into more debt if your roof starts leaking, if your car breaks down. And that's for the lucky people who own cars or homes. The further into poverty you delve, the more desperate people are. Often working multiple jobs for 60+ hours a week, on top of trying to maintain their home, take care of kids, and meet their legal obligations.   4. Neo-liberalism is very effective at sedating the masses. We are spoiled with choice living in the Imperial Core. For many, it's literally drugs, for others it's gambling/betting or drinking. People are victims of societal excess, and our culture glorifies and encourages it.  5. People don't understand what's happening because the American Education system is awful at explaining political systems and the context of protesting or rebellion to children. There is not glorifying of civil action, with maybe the two exceptions of the American Revolutionary War (possibly the Civil War, depending on where you live, because some states still glorify the Confederacy), and the Civil Rights Movement. But even among those events, violence against the system and most political speech that isn't expressly Patriotic is not taught. Hell, they're purposely trying to make it worse right now by federally banning negative mentions of slavery and the horrors of racism through their Anti-DEI initiatives. They literally do not want us to learn about our own mistakes because they want to make them again on purpose.   I hope this clarifies for you.",spikus93,2025-05-07T10:13:48,38

"A lot of great comments here responding to the points made, but I just want to add one thing to contrast the American Civil War with today. As many have said, it was started by the succession of the southern states, but it also had pretty distinct battle lines. Southern states on one side of the conflict, northern states on the other with a pretty clear line of demarcation.   We no longer have the luxury of such clear territories. I happen to live in a purple area of one of the most red counties in a very blue state. I am literally a long bike ride or short drive from one of the most liberal counties in the country. And the dividing line between those two counties literally divide the next town over in half. Look up a 2024 presidential election map by county. There is no more line of demarcation. The entire country is islands of blue surrounded by seas of red. Add in the giganticness of the US, and you will start to see the problem.   A drive to protest in DC from where I live would be a 25 hour drive, not including stops to eat or rest. It's a 2 or 3 day drive in each direction. So in order to protest in Washington for 1 day, I need to take 5-7 days off work. And I live in the central US, it is worse for those on the west coast. LA to DC is a 40 hour drive. 4 days each way.... that's just not doable for most people.",crazy_urn,2025-05-07T11:51:33,3

"Because I'm a social democrat, not a socialist. For a social democrat, the end goal is not monopolistic state control of all companies and institutions, because that concentrates too much power and wealth. For a social democrat, the end goal is to preserve many institutions, rather than destroy them. The end goal, and happy medium, is to have strong public ownership of resources and the economy. For example, our government could have a sovereign wealth fund and own minority stakes in major companies, and benefit from their untaxed, buy-back filled capital appreciation.   Norway has a sovereign wealth fund, they are only allowed to withdraw a tiny percent per year, and it funds 25% of their budget. Public ownership is important. But eliminating capitalism and radically changing a competitive system is not the end goal for a social democrat; it's to increase competition and increase the wealth of the long and oppressed tail of an unusually compacted Pareto distribution of wealth. Inequality now is worse than right before the Great Depression, but the Pareto distribution now is similar to the Guilded Age, which was also followed by economic collapse.   It would be nice to avoid these historical extremes and it is very practically feasible, but only if enough people change their minds.",Fauster,2025-05-08T13:25:50,1
"It's not my fault that the GOP is gearing up to sell land that I freely use as Western-state citizen to try to maintain Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts that were never paid for, adding to my future tax bill, with 83% of that stolen money going to the top 1%. In case you think you have a realistic potential to be in the top 1%, I can assure you that you do not, unless you make most of your household's money from capital appreciation to the tune of $700k+ a year in income. This is not typical doctor or lawyer money. If you are paid mostly in salary and not stock options, then you are the sad and pitiful loser under this regime. Keep in mind, that the LT inflation is dominantly caused by increases in M2 monetary supply created by banks, with a small portion caused by unfunded treasury sales. The rich and the banks are responsible for this inflation, because under the ever-present Pareto distribution, most money goes to those with tangible generational wealth that serves as huge collateral for huge cash infusions. People getting loans for houses and cars that are backed by their salary are only responsible for a trickle of inflation.    If Republicans think they can sell off our national parks, forests, and public lands, which are extremely popular even among West-Coast rednecks without risk, then they should be swiftly be disabused of this notion. Selling off public lands is an enormous boon to the very rich, who don't need public land with their sprawling ranches and estates, the large corporations that will buy it, and the banks that will fund the transactions. These parties need to be made aware that these transactions will involve significant risks of profound capital depreciation. Also, the push to divest the U.S. of our public lands heritage should be countered by a push to increase our public lands and punish developers and speculators.   Like I said, the goal of this is to start playing hardball, because we are already playing hardball. Currently, as a public citizen who doesn't have a liquid net worth of $13 million, the amount needed to make $750k a year from 7% average interest in stocks and bonds, I am a victim of the utra-high-net-worth individuals ($10 million+ assets, cherished by banks), who have been instituting polices to accelerate wealth inequality and decrease real wages since the fifties.

the spread out part is such a huge aspect that non americans just can't seem to grasp. if it only takes a couple hours from anywhere in ur country to be at the capitol protesting then its not that big of a time/money/expense sink. it is unrealistic to expect joe blow dem from arkansas to fly to washington DC and protest for a week.   joe blow from arkansas could go to the state capitol and protest there with the 200 other dems protesting but it just doesn't hit the same in such small groups. you don't get national coverage for a bunch of tiny protests.,Calcifer643,2025-05-07T14:18:40,3

However, if someone is going to buy government property, it is likely with the purpose of either stripping it of resources (clearcut, oil extraction, etc.) or improvement - building something.

"Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and the larger Great Lakes region used to be *the* major U.S. industrial hub, but much of it was outsourced to Japan and later China, and Canada and Mexico under NAFTA. Buffalo, Tonawanda and the Lockport area also used to be a major shipping hub via the Erie Canal, but most traffic now goes through the St. Lawrence Seaway and doesn't spend nearly as much time in the area.  As a result the buffalo niagara region is full of unused and decaying industrial and logistics infrastructure, and the poverty spread from there. Much of what was left was just the low-paying service and support sector jobs without the manufacturing and logistics economic engine that used to drive the region. There are conversion projects aimed at repurposing a lot of these old abandoned commercial buildings into service venues and switching the area to an upscale service based economy, but it's slow going and it will take a lot of time to return wealth to the region, and of course there's always the concern of gentrifying too quickly and causing more issues by driving out the existing residents before they can benefit.  If you're wondering how Trump wins the great lakes region, this is why. The democrats used to be the labor party but a lot of people in the region with blue collar history (justified or not) feel like the democrats have sold the region out by embracing international trade.

Biden also did an incredibly impressive amount while in office. You guys just do everything in your power to ignore it and pretend it never happened.   But Dems got me affordable healthcare. They've banned hundreds of different ways corporations had been ripping us off (just look at the trillions of dollars the CFPB had saved us before trump gutted us). They capped drug costs. They gave us child tax credits (until republicans took them away) that took half of kids out of poverty. Free school lunches. Great foreign policy - russia was going to take Ukraine in a week and thanks to the worldwide network of arms donations and intelligence Biden put together, they still haven't succeeded. Biden never even had a true majority in congress and he still fixed the entire nation's infrastructure, and did it with high paying union jobs. Biden fixed the economic landslide that trump started by ignoring the pandemic. He got everyone back to work after covid and then some. I mean we had the worst pandemic in over 100 years and ended up with *lower* unemployment than before thanks to Dems. Biden brought manufacturing jobs back to the US that trump lost us. He brought chip manufacturing back, which is absolutely crucial in this tech heavy world where Taiwan completely dominates the market - though now trump has killed it again out of spite for his predecessor's success.   Dems got rid of junk fees in your utility bills and from airlines. They made it so all subscriptions have to be as easy to cancel as they were to sign up for.   Dems have also organized lawsuits that have stopped most all of trump's horrible executive orders. Them stopping republican tyranny is probably the best thing they do.

What often times ends up happening is that the rich avoid the wealth distribution and the middle class and upper middle class who are just starting to get ahead get stuck with the bill.   That's why it's so hard to get people on board with it. They fear they will eventually get the tax increases.

In my hometown in rural Alabama they applied for and got a grant from Obama to build a new fire dept. Building. There was nothing wrong with the old one and it still sits empty, but the reasoning they stated at the Town Hall meeting was that if they didn't get the grant someone in California would.  Another town got a grant to build a 62 million pedestrian bridge across the main road in town. This is a bridge no one really was begging for. Alot of people are now upset because most people are scared to cross it because of the prostitutes and meth heads who tend to hang around. This is a town where everyone has a car and if you said you were going to walk .1 of a mile people look at you like your crazy.  The city is building the bridge because it's mostly subsidized and the shot callers are probably getting a kickback. If you had put it to a popular vote the residents of the city would have never spent 62 million of their own money.

Even if they get unemployment, they are then on the hook for their own health insurance.  America is not the land of the free and hasn't been for a very long time.

Steel is heavy. So it would be way cheaper to just make it on the moon vs put it on a rocket and send it up. Thats just steel. There are all kinds of minerals on the moon. The more space you control the more mines you have. Also right now we have a generally good idea. But we cant conduct sub surface geological surveys with any kind of accuracy compared to a survey conducted on earth right now. So the more land you initially have. The more likely you are to have that supe rich mineral mine in your territory by luck.  The larger your territory the easier it will be to land on the moon without impinging on other nations air space. Easier take offs and landings. There are more desirable latitudes because the temperature swings are less extreme than the poles and the equator. Also less sunlight means less radiation.

So the South seceded and then attacked Fort Sumter which the North was holding because they didn't believe secession was legal and then the war began initially to preserve the union without any special emphasis on ending slavery which Lincoln made sure to dance around/ensure the population wasn't why they were fighting.   Eventually though his views began to shift and he did eventually sign the Emancipation Proclamation but again, that only freed slaves on rebel territory and he obviously died before fully ending it.

You aren't protesting climate change or indigenous rights right now instead of posting on Reddit. Do you care at all?                        I've been there at my congressman's office asking why he doesn't talk to people who live here and doesn't hold town halls. Even the worst person who's ever sat in his chair did that stuff, the current guy doesn't engage with the people who live here at all. It's over 1,100 miles to his office in D.C. where he spends most of his time and he might actually see his protest, instead of just the annoyingly rude lady who answers calls at his office here in Minnesota.            The bottom line here, if you want to bitch about what people are doing in another country, then here. This will help you understand the country:          People aren't out protesting by the millions here because the U.S. is 50 smaller countries that are all also separated into tinier districts where everyone lives in their own even smaller information bubble. There's no leadership to drive the movement; there's no party calling for nationwide general strikes, there's no voice to rally behind that is driving the conversation on opposition. It's all fractured pieces and small groups designed to combat single-issue causes; one group will protest immigration rights, another labor issues, another union labor issues, another maybe minimum wage. Another group protests abortion and women's rights, another wants to protect national forests. None of them make a cohesive movement and all of them are under attack separately, spending time and money and people fighting for individual causes without being able to unite against the one big national catalyst creating them. One group might be in Washington or Oregon, another in Minneapolis, another in Florida or Arizona.         A week ago, and about three weeks ago, we had *thousands* of protests across the country with disparate groups rallying in most major population areas, with hundreds of thousands of people protesting. Most news organizations here barely covered it at all. Of the three local news stations where I live, I think one ran a minor story on it. Congress and the presidency is entirely controlled by Republicans, who are united in ignoring any of it.           And if you're in Canada I don't get how you don't understand people needing to drive to protest here. If the same thing was happening there, how much of an effect do you think people would have if they put together a protest about what was going on in Ottawa by standing with signs in front of a government building in Wood Buffalo or Moncton without any organized national movement? Even in those situations a good chunk of the people there would have to drive into the city from elsewhere in the province to put together any kind of meaningful protest.              For a real, meaningful protest there'd need to be a movement that put millions of people in the streets in Washington D.C. for that to happen. Most people can't afford to just pull up and go there to make that happen, there's no united front organizing people to be able to do that anyway, and even if they did... it's Donald Trump. He's not going to change his mind because anyone wants him to, because people ask, or even because it's the right thing to do. I've been out and protested when physically able to do that, but nobody out there has any delusions about it changing the country. This isn't a government that cares what its citizens want or is going to be swayed by anything other than measures that destroy where we live entirely. You'd think it'd be understandable why people don't immediately jump directly to that step, because you wouldn't do it and aren't doing it either.",Oodlydoodley,2025-05-07T13:36:11,5

"> Absent an actual conviction for insurrection, a person can be on the ballot.   That's absolutely not what the constitution states. Requiring a conviction for insurrection was left out on purpose. And the supreme court did not specify a conviction either, they claimed that it was up to congress.  The sole role of congress was already explicitly specified:  >No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. *But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability*.   Trump was determined by *multiple* courts of law to have engaged in insurrection, and even the supreme court, when given the opportunity, refused to overrule those findings.  Instead the supreme court bullshitted and passed it off on congress. Which was bullshit because congress can't be both the sole party to grant an exception for an insurrectionist, and simultaneously be the sole party that can vote to determine one. Because then the circumstances specified in the amendment can never actually happen.  > Otherwise, states will start concocting reasons for A or B to not be on their state's ballot and presidential elections would boil down to which party controls which states.

"It was written to take care of former Confederate soldiers. I'm not sure they envisioned someone sitting in the White House chewing on cheeseburgers and watching TV as being insurrrective. A decision of insurrection by a state court has limited weight considering it's an offense against the federal government.   I agree, the concept is a total mess and highly subjective (considering only a handful of states contemplated it and only one took it far enough to be challenged).  But plenty of what going on the last few years (including the process Jan 6 tried to stop) are ambiguous and open to interpretation.   What happens in 4 years if there's a VP with far less respect for the constitution (wouldn't happen, would it??)  who decided he had the right to arbitrarily refuse to accept some states' votes?  The process for the congress to decide on who wins if the electoral college fails IIRC is biased toward one-state-one-vote.   What happens if because the POTUS decides there's an ""invasion"" by MS13 he has the right to suspend Habeus Corpus?  What happens if the speaker of the house decides a single day is actually the entire length of the sitting of the house? What happens if the DoJ refuses to prosecute its own side's transgressions and starts instead trying to trump up (sorry) charges against the other side? What happens if SCOTUS decides the rule of law does not apply to POTUS?

That's kind of my point though.  These numbers are hard to get accurate and measuring them differently changes the results drastically   This is why I brought the 260 days of work a year into question.  This feels incredibly likely that the method of measuring is playing a huge role.  It's suspicious that 52 weeks in a year x 5 days a week = 260 days a year.,UnsafePantomime,2025-05-07T18:50:40,1
"I don't care what the other person said, because it was never the point I was making. You said people could go somewhere else if they wanted a change. I challenged *that* point. No, most people can't.  The working issue has some relevance. Just because we aren't working doesn't actually mean anything to your point, because we have plenty of other infrastructure problems, too. Some of us need to go to appointments. Some of us need to do car maintenance, or head to the DMV, or whatever. These places are open during work days. I *am* protesting, but I can understand plenty the people who aren't able to because *I live here and I get it*. And it's harder now, because I work a full-time job and just took a second job for extra income. If you don't work a full-time job, not only do you not get health insurance, most employers don't give you leave either. So if you're working 2-3 part-time jobs, you get no leave; when you have spare time you do the things you need to do. As important as protesting and rejecting these illegal actions is, sometimes it just can't be our priority. Try living here in this fucked up system before casually tossing around statistics that you don't have the context for.",ThinkyRetroLad,2025-05-07T12:37:43,6

"So he didn't win because of the electoral college, but because most Americans voted for him. Your arguement also applies to conservatives in blue states, so it would cancel out. Most Americans voted for Trump. Even if he had lost, the fact that it was even close is dumb.",robendboua,2025-05-07T13:57:23,1
"You know, the primary difference between our politics is that I am concerned the Democrats are not doing enough to effectively oppose the Republicans and you can't abide any criticism of them. Which is why since the 2016 primary, I have maxed my political contributions on Democrats. I have contributed my time and money to special elections and in particular to supporting progressive victory in their efforts to contacting voters for the contested North Carolina supreme Court race. And what have you done, but run cover for Democrats and sap the energy for reform?  I look at the demographics, popularity, and actions of elected Democrats and I'm worried that the entire party apparatus is a decade away from being able to mount a meaningful opposition to whatever Republican administration may be in power in the future, much less field their own candidate with the notoriety and record to be electable.   I am concerned that the most prominent and popular voices in the democratic party have already been sufficiently demonized by the right that their electability is in question, and there are no up and coming candidates with the experience, record and politics to replace them. I have fundamental worries about how the democratic party is going to adapt to the changing political landscape and already they are so far behind. Already we have backslid decades on policy and frankly, we don't know how long it would take under democratic governance just to return to where we were in 2016.   As someone who voted for Biden and Harris, they were the best the party could muster. That is a tragedy. While the rest of us acknowledged we were voting for a sundowning old man, I was getting a very similar tone from the gaslighters, saying he was mentally fit. People with eyes knew it, the party knew it, the opposition knew it. And even though the party had 4 years to plan for 2024, they ran a farce of a primary claiming Biden intended to be reelected, robbing from democratic constituents the opportunity to pick their next presidential candidate, only for Biden to drop out 43 days after the primary ended. Putting Harris, one of the least popular candidates in 2020, at the top of the ticket with 107 days until election—a maneuver which has never resulted in the presidency in the history of this country—was the most unforced error of a hailmary I have seen in my life. Sure, the Republicans lie, cheat and steal but the Democrats can't even play a straight game well. That needs to change.  TL:DR: I am more concerned with the longevity of the party and its ability to meaningfully adapt to the changing political landscape, than citing the changing political landscape as an excuse for their failures. There is no value in an excuse if no action is taken to address the material issues with democratic electability. I think that rhetoric you are pushing is not constructive, fails to recognize the shortcomings of the party and is an obstacle to the necessary changes the party must go through to adapt to a changing political landscape that is biased more and more against Democrats.",DahDollar,2025-05-07T19:48:16,1
"Please stop treating me like I'm being obtuse. You said ""People are not trying hard enough"". That statement is incredibly condescending to people who are trying but arent living up to your arbitrary standards. You followed it up with ""Very Very few people are trying hard enough and no one is shitting on them."". So by your own logic, there is an overwhelming majority of people who arent doing enough to please your standards of ""hard enough"" and the only people youre not shitting on is the people not in the aforementioned group.  Unless you have talked to and assessed the life to political rebellion quota of all Americans, do you really believe you should be the arbitrary decider of who is and isnt ""trying hard enough""? Again, Im using your words here.   Do you think you have a complete and comprehensive idea of what everyone is doing and if its all theyre capable of? If not then your original post is incredible presumptive and dismissive of many people you claim you weren't condescending too.  I apologize if explaining the opinion you openly offered in a discussion forum is annoying but you havent given me an actual response to the points I'm making.

I know what you're saying. I just don't think that the majority of Americans should be averaged out when the disparity in income is so high it's ridiculous.
