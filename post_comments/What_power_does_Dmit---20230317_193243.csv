"I’m not too educated on Russian politics so take this with a grain of salt, but from my perspective, it seems like Putin finds Medvedev to be reliable, he’s been around for a while and has been going along with Putin the entire time. Putin is just rewarding him, and keeping someone he can “trust” in positions of power that he can’t occupy himself. I don’t see any “power” that Medvedev could have over Putin.",Phantom78611,2023-04-10T15:43:27,2
