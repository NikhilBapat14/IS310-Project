He does this a lot lately. It makes him look as small and weak as he really is. But at least he gives the other guys a break from kneeling.,moreobviousthings,2025-05-08T10:57:13,33
Since optics are so important to him I'm surprised he doesn't have his chair higher.  He looks like a 8yo trying to sit at the grownups table for thanksgiving.,Ianthin1,2025-05-08T11:18:31,20

It’s so weird how he does this.,tommyalanson,2025-05-08T11:22:13,5
He does it to look like a “king”. It’s so funny how many things he does cause he thinks it makes him look strong but it’s the exact opposite,everyoneneedsaherro,2025-05-08T11:30:39,6

He even slouchs when he's at his desk. What a slob.,Monamo61,2025-05-08T12:09:26,3
"You’d think he would want them all to appear lower than him. But whatever, maybe he can’t stand very long anymore, and we’re in a “suppress info on his physical condition,” mode a la FDR.",freexanarchy,2025-05-08T12:13:44,3

"Hiding the diaper, the lean, and the dragging of his right leg. Even at rallies, there is a red, white, and blue platform built just high enough to camouflage the lack of control and movement in his right leg.

It's got shit on it I suggest it be burned once he is gone as well as all his gaudy things and portraits.,Kannazuki1985,2025-05-08T13:29:16,1
"No one in the media talks about how much he is sitting, usually hunched over. Often sleeping. Hair falling out. Dark bruises on his hand. Long, incoherent rants. He is severely diminished. He looks small here. They are clearly covering up his decline.",LodossDX,2025-05-08T13:41:26,1

It's not so much a break as it is he needs the scabs on their knees to heal so they don't bleed in the oval office after all the head bobbing he make them do.,BorntobeTrill,2025-05-08T12:39:20,6
