"This dude is a cartoon villain. He helped setup a charity to save a veteran's dog, stole the money and the dog died.  https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/18/politics/george-santos-veteran-dog-gofundme/index.html",baz4k6z,2025-04-25T16:59:56,29
He’s an unethical man who lied and cheated his way into politics. He stole and cheated the very people who put him there. I hope they feel as stupid as they were for voting him in without doing due diligence.,Biotic1,2025-04-25T16:42:01,18

"The man got what he deserves. Corrupt officials should be removed and procecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Him being removed while he was actively destroying the country was an added perk, despite that not being the reason. Remember, Al Capone was only convicted for tax evasion, despite being guilty of much more, like this moron",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-25T16:26:34,13

"If he was white and straight sure, but unfortunately for Georgie Porgie here he's a queer Latino. It's why he's the very very very rare time sadly, the GOP decides to actually hold someone accountable. And it's not even accountability, it's making an example of. They have been using this Jabroni as the ""See we police our own"" example. If he was white and straight they would be defending him against ""the woke mob"".",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-25T17:48:57,6
