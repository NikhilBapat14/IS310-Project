It can be. Cutting benefits and firing tons of employees for very minor infractions is a trend in the wrong direction. Would be nice if the power dynamic could be shifted more toward workers like it was for some during the pandemic. ,StormOk7544,2025-05-09T07:03:51,16
"Could there be such a thing as ethical capitalism? I know what most will say, but what if? How could such a concept be defined? I know all the reasons we ""can't"", but if we were tasked to draw up the ""rules' for such a society, what would it look like?   I ask because too many wealthy people think we want what they have at the levels they have it. This is not true. I believe in capitalism, the freedom to advance upward and decide how to get there, etc. But what most of us want to be comfortable, healthy, housed, fed, clothed does not require much at all in comparison to the top 2% standards. The uber rich can remain uber rich, remain many, many floors up from me or you, remain the wealthiest. But does this require so much death and suffering? I don't want what they have, never have. How could this translate into policy? Again, I know the reasons and mentality of immediately saying no, and even my dog could answer that. But for sport, let's talk about how ethical economies could look. Just a little Friday fun. I'm curious what others think.",sassafrass14,2025-05-09T10:48:17,2

"I worked as a printing specialist at USIA and State as a member of the Foreign Service for 28 years mostly at the FP02/01 (GS-14/15 equivalent) level with my last six as special assistant to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration at State and had a lot of contact with senior level Schedule C political patronage employees of both parties in the Regan though Obama administration. They are the real source of inefficiency in the Federal Government because they are all party ‘hacks’ who care more about their party’s agenda.    The agenda during the Republican administrations was privatize as much of government as possible, not downsizing it, just putting it in the hands private industry which makes political contributions.  Those given the ‘plum’ jobs in the Republican administrations tended to be ‘financial bundlers’ who had some level of business experience.    The agenda during Clinton / Gore administration was the promotion of women and minorities with the Sch. C jobs filled by community organizer types who were ‘vote  bundler’ getting people to the polls to pull the D lever on election days. That’s because in the late 1960s - 1970s there was a wholesale abandonment of the Democratic Party by the pro-segregationist antebellum white ‘Jim Crow’ whites in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964 by psychopath LBJ who had to be well aware that would happen.  George Wallace running as an independent in 1968 split the Democratic vote North to South winning 16% if the popular vote and allowing Nixon to beat Humphrey with only 43% which pretty clearly delineated the hard core racist and Republican base demographics.  The shift in party allegiance in the South became evident in 1972 when Nixon got re-elected with 62% and a 48-2 landslide in the Electoral College.    It was Nixon who declared the war on drugs which became the justification for militarizing police forces and increasing the US Prison population by 3X in the process de franchising thousands of minority Democratic leaning voters. The EPA was also create under his administration which cleaned up the air and water but also made made it impossible for US producers of Steel and Aluminum to compete with overseas production. I worked in a Chicago area Steel Mill in the summers of 1970 and 1971 and it was already clear to me those industries were going to disappear in the US my lifetime, why in 1982 I took the job in the Foreign Service spending 11 of those 28 years in Manila were the State Department established a large printing center in part because labor costs there were 1/10th that in the US.    Over my career I supervised the printing and distribution to every country with a US Diplomatic presence copies of the Constitution, Declaration of Independence and History of the US which where distributed to ‘influencers’ in those countries prior to 1995 when things transitioned to the Internet.    Reading the Constitution hundreds of times over those years I came to realize there actually wasn’t anything DEMOCRATIC in the original plan.  The only part directly elected by popular vote were the House Seats, but non-citizens and slaves as 3/5 of a person where included in the Census used to determine distribution of House Seats between the States with the States allowed to Gerrymander the boundaries to keep the incumbent party in power.  Also the Constitution originally called for one House Seats per 30,000 people (not citizens) counted in the Census which had seats not been capped at 435 in 1929 by a House Bill (not an ammendment) there would currently be 1,100 seats in the House.  The Senate is even less Democratic because every State got two Senate seats irrespective of number of citizens or geographic area.  I concluded the Constitution was really just a plan by the white male elite ruling class of CAPITALISTS to keep the levers of power in their hands forever.    The power centers of Capitalism have shifted from the Colonial South in the 1700 to the Industrial Coal Fueled Steam powered NE and Midwest in the 1800s and then to California and Texas in the 1900s after the discovery of Gold, Oil and Gas.  WWII and the Cold War added the Military Industrial complex. Over time wealth and political power became concentrated in fewer and fewer dynastic families and increasing those in public office became whores who wore different Red and Blue suits and dresses but with same green $$$ undergarments  What is happening now is the Capitalists trying to dismantle the welfare stated created in the 1930s and 40s under the 32 year rule of FDR and expanded by the Democratic Party after losing the white southern votes. The only way for the Democratic Party to stay in power after the election of Nixon in 1968 was to go all in pandered to minorities and the fringe left and open the borders to increase the number of new Democratic leaning legally Naturalized immigrants and Birthright Citizen children of illegals. It failed to anticipate the backlash that would cause and stupidy ran Hillary who even most Democrats couldn’t stomach against Trump 2016",VA_CHP,2025-05-09T08:04:25,0

The various ""Communist"" states did not and do not claim they've achieved communism; just that they intended for the world to achieve it and then they'd disband.  In addition, in individualism, mutualism, and collectivism, 1. ownership is more dispersed and no longer creates a distinct economic class; this may involve more small-scale private, union, or community ownership, and more market-based or non-market based forms, and 2. there is no ruling class.

"I think you're now confusing capital and currency.   Accumulated money *can* be capital, but it is not the only form of capital. Real estate, factories, tools, technologies (that you hold a patent to), debt (that someone owes to you) are all examples of forms of capital. The goal of capital, in whatever form, is to generate more wealth.   Markets exist for people to trade products for other products (or currency) of equal value. If you have chickens and I have goats, then I can trade my goat milk for your eggs and we've established a market. It doesn't really have to be more complicated than that, and in this example didn't include any currency changing hands.   If 10 more goat farmers move into our valley, then all of a sudden my goat milk will probably be worth less eggs, and your eggs will be worth as much goat milk as you feel like having because they're scarce. The change in relative supply has changed the price of both these goods. If one of the goat farmers learns how to make cheese (and keeps the recipe a secret), then they will be able to trade cheese for eggs at a much better ""price"" than they could have paid with milk. This is a free market at work.   I recommend reading Debt by David Graeber for a really good look into the history of debt and currency to flesh out my very crude explanation. Though I'm also willing to answer any more questions you have to the best of my ability.  As far as ""Who owns the means of production"" that is the question that determines what kind of economy you're in. In capitalism, the elite (""capitalists"") own the means of production and use it to enrich themselves, then use their wealth to make sure they can become wealthier regardless of the effect of this process on the rest of humanity and the Earth. This is exactly the state of the world, if you're paying attention.

">Ensuring that everyone has access to necessities is definitely profitable.  Everyone doesn't have the ability to pay for necessities, so how would it be profitable?   If you want to provide for everyone, you'd have to be willing to take significant losses. If it was profitable, we'd already be doing it.  >Access to necessities always depends on one's ability to acquire them, whether through force or an economic system.  You're oversimplifying the issue. First, I said pay for, not aquire. Paying is a specific method for gaining access to goods and services that is tied directly to one's purchasing power.  If you don't have sufficient purchasing power to pay for it, you can't gain access.   So capitalism ensures that those who have sufficient purchasing power have access, and ensures that those who have insufficient purchasing power do not have access. Which contradicts your claim that the purpose of capitalism is to ensure EVERYONE has access.   Ensuring that everyone has access to necessities would mean guaranteeing that everyone can receive them, regardless of one's ability to pay for it.
