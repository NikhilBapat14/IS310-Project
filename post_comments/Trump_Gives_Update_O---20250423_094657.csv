"Such an awfully worded title from the DC. He didn't give an update. He just deflected the question. Reporters need to keep hounding him on this. He promised a full release, and the American people deserve a full release. Their stalling is becoming questionable. I understand the need to protect the identities of victims, but that wouldn't take months if a group were motivated the get the information out there.",HereIGoAgain99,2025-04-23T11:22:39,171
Either the fbi successfully destroyed the files or there are too many government officials on it to release. Either way I don’t think we’re getting it. They have had more than enough time to do whatever it was they needed,AlchemistJeep,2025-04-23T21:41:09,13
"""President Donald Trump told Daily Caller White House Correspondent Reagan Reese on Tuesday he would need to consult with Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the timeline for releasing additional Jeffrey Epstein files.  While taking questions in the Oval Office, Trump emphasized his administration’s commitment to transparency but deferred specific details to Department of Justice (DOJ) officials.  “I don’t know, I’ll speak to the attorney general about that. I really don’t know,” Trump said when asked about the timeline for releasing the remaining Epstein documents. “I know that we’ve done the RFK, the Kennedy, Martin Luther King is out there very shortly, so we’ll find out. But … we’ve really really announced, we’re doing them in full transparency.”  .  Video:  https://x.com/DailyCaller/status/1914794149024325909",Ironman650,2025-04-23T09:47:29,8

"Yep we can keep thinking otherwise but the reality is it won't happen. Very disappointing, this isn't a left or right thing, the American people deserve to know. The swamp has no party loyalty",krazyellinas23,2025-04-23T18:20:33,13
That the world might implode if that list is released because 98% of our world leaders (previous and current) are all evil p3dos,sowellpatrol,2025-04-23T22:36:51,10
