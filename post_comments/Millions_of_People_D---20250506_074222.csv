Great Lakes are only 80% of NA's fresh water. Our oligarchs can make millions more if we get rid of all the water and waste regulations. So it's basically a no-brainer- plenty of other drinking water options but limited ways to increase profit margins fast!,verygoodverygoodyayy,2025-05-06T10:34:23,6
