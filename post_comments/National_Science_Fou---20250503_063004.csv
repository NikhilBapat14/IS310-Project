"Original Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01396-2  In simple terms, this kills American academic scientific research. Without funding, researchers simply can't do their work. Some institutions like the Ivies and select others may be able to self-fund using their endowment, but even they will show a steep drop in output. This also means that non-tenured faculty at most universities will likely face termination unless they can find new funding through private industry, foreign grants, or something else.",LoganJFisher,2025-05-03T06:32:56,151

Even if you are a GOP dipshit nationalist how do you think the US will continue to remain technologically dominant in the world if we don't fund any research in order?

Not only research but also future researchers. I work at a top 5 public university and I lost most of my funding in January but this will kill thousands of student fellowships at my university alone.

Unless you are packing up the communities to move to france too, there is no way for that research to be moved. Let alone any research on north american specific wildlife or invasive species.  -edit- while the scientists may be easily moved, their life projects can be reliant on what they set up in America to study a population, location, environment, etc. If they are lucky and it is easily moved stuff like bacteria, or something more virtual, they can move it to another nation.",MockDeath,2025-05-03T09:47:22,18

"I mean, sort of. Again, working in research there will be great scientists that can come. But the last 10 years of research they were working on may not be salvageable.  For instance, if someone is doing a long term study on exposure to X because of manufacturing near by, testing people and tracking peoples health in the area. You can't just pick that up by moving to Europe. You have to either start over, or keep with the same population. You can do some stuff depending to merge a new and old set of people together.  But I am not joking, a very large amount of research can't be lifted and moved. Only the scientists and SOME science can. ESPECIALLY for anything longitudinal.",MockDeath,2025-05-03T16:00:28,6
"This will also hurt the vast array of companies that supply and service technical equipment and manufacture consumables that research labs rely on. Delivery companies like FedEx and UPS are going to lose money. Companies that supply liquified and compressed gasses, etc are losing major business. Plant operations at universities employ plumbers, electricians, HVAC techs. You environmental health and safety workers. You have people laundering lab coats, and sanitation workers. These are blue collar jobs that are a crucial part of running our world class research labs and make universities hubs of economic activity funded largely by the government. This is a bone-headed decision made by people that have never set foot in a lab and a disgusting waste of potential.",meTspysball,2025-05-03T15:28:05,6
