"There is a lot that can be said about the failed democratization of the Russian Federation in the 1990s and the subsequent autocratization under Putin since the 2000s. A few good easy reads are [McFaul (2021)](https://journalofdemocracy.org/articles/russias-road-to-autocracy/) and [Snegovaya (2023)](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/why-russias-democracy-never-began/).   Some of the most important aspects before Putin came to power were:  \- The lack of an independent judiciary and respect for the rule of law, instead of a rule by law and presidential decrees.   \- A political system that put too much control in the hands of the president and too little in the parliament. Any person in that position who does not like the idea of democracy can thus easily change the course of the nation.   \- The economic reforms by the 'shock doctrine', which caused all state wealth to become concentrated in the hands of oligarchs, whilst at the same time led to enormous economic hardship for the average Russian citizens. The economic meltdown as well as the lawlessness and rise of organized crime gave many Russian citizens an association of chaos and poverty to the idea of (liberal) democracy.   \- Parts of Russia claiming to be independent, for example Chechnya, or given special constitutions, which meant that the Federal state no longer had much say in these places. This led to a war the Russian military lost with the First Chechen War.   Since Putin came to power:  \- Eliminating all media freedom, instead turning the state TV into his own propaganda channel. Designating any NGOs with funding from abroad as 'foreign agents' to discredit them.  \- Creating not only his own political party, but also fake alternative political parties or weak candidates to run in Russian elections, to keep up the appearance of a normal democratic process, even though these are not free or fair elections at all.   \- Removing and prosecuting any oligarch who dared to oppose him and locking them up or forcing them out of the country.  \- Bringing Chechnya back into the fold with the brutal Second Chechen War.   \- Create a power vertical in which personally appointed governors get to run parts of Russia, implementing Putin's decisions, while bypassing the official local electoral institutions.  \- Changing the constitution by referendum to allow himself more (and longer) presidential terms, even if he already had served the maximum of two presidential terms.  &#x200B;  I'd say it is a lot less likely in Western countries, especially if they have healthy and competitive elections, if the rule of law and an independent judiciary is respected and if there are no severe economic crises, lots of political violence or territorial losses that can make ordinary citizens disappointed in democracy. Still, a strong presidential system can lend itself to executive aggrandizement (refusing to relinquish power even if defeated in an election) and referenda that allow more concentration of power in the hands of the president should not be trusted much. Peculiar first-past-the-post electoral system engineering can also lead to supermajorities with an incentive to entrench their rule and making the next vote just a little less fair.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2024-06-05T19:19:05,23
