At this point you have to wonder if Trump is even consciously lying or if he just literally losing his mind.  I’m inclined to go with the latter at this point. The delusion is real.,jediporcupine,2025-05-03T08:25:32,15

"I wonder what goes through the mind of the average Republican when they read him say things like ""the price of eggs is way down"" and ""gas is under $2 a gallon"". All of them know without a doubt from direct experience that it isn't true, they buy gas and eggs all the time. Is the idea that if you just believe in something stubbornly enough it will become true?",entr0py3,2025-05-03T09:37:39,10
"> The U.S. imports more oil from Canada than any other country, meaning Trump’s relationship with new Prime Minister Mark Carney could impact future gas prices — especially in regions that rely heavily on Canadian gas, such as the Midwest, the Rocky Mountains and New England.  Canada has sold a record volume of Canadian crude to China in just the last couple of months Carney has been interim and now elected leader of Canada. I don't expect that momentum will change.   Meanwhile, the economic benefits to the US of buying Canadian crude oil at a deep discount have been astronomical. America gets cheap gasoline and refines its own oil to sell on the world market at a mark-up. This sweet deal for America has played a major part in also creating a trade surplus in Canada's favour which Trump has penalized with tariffs because 'trade deficit bad' (are you seeing the lunacy yet)   So if we can sell less oil to America and more to China we can get rid of our surplus with the US. This in turn will mean less profit for America and higher gas prices while the justification for tariffs on Canada evaporates.   Personally, I love the diversification for Canada, but does this make any fucking business sense at all for America? I'm beginning to think that this is not a very smart man you have running your country.",biscuitarse,2025-05-03T08:33:45,15

"Fun fact, the US doesn't refine it's own oil.  We ship our good oil (sweet light crude) to other less advanced countries because we can sell it for more as it takes less refinement.  Our refineries are advanced so we refine the crap (heavy sour crude) oil from Canada and the mid east.    This means that Trump's tariff war will push the cost of the imported oil we refine and decrease the value of oil we export, drive up the cost of fuel and decrease the profit the oil companies make.
