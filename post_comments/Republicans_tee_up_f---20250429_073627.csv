That is disgusting.  They should cut their own pay and benefits first.,thieh,2025-04-29T07:40:56,46
"Republicans ran this playbook at the state level in Wisconsin in 2011. It plays well with the Republican base, and ties in with forced redistribution to the wealthy, a hallmark of Republican policy for the past 45+ years. One would think the wealthy and their wealthy heirs would be well-positioned after 4+ decades suckling at the government tax-cut teat, but they've long atrophied their ability to fend without their huge crutch.   Anyways, the public sentiment runs against the smallest group, and the federal worker group is a small percentage of the population. It does not matter to base MAGA conservatives and their Jan 6 cohorts that wage and benefit stagnation and regression occurs when there is no upward forcing on those items in either the public or private sector. It does not matter that making the federal government jobs less appealing as an option creates more competition for job positions in the private sector.  It's wrongly-focused retribution for the last 45 years of wage stagnation, benefit regression and chasm-wide inequality between the beneficiaries at the top income levels (who get the tax cuts) and the working-class. But, MAGAts will savor the feeling of sticking it to people who willingly sign up to work for the betterment of their country. Sad.",localistand,2025-04-29T07:54:49,14
"I have never understood the logic of ""paying for tax cuts"".   If the country needs the revenue from taxes, stop cutting them. I can't stand corruption in the guise of populism.",Binks-Sake-Is-Gone,2025-04-29T08:43:46,12
"Federal worker here with 25 years of service. I was going to retire at 60 with 29 years of service thanks to the FERS supplement. With these changes, it’ll be hard to do that. So, the government will instead pay my full salary for those two years. And if I wait until I’m 62, my annuity will be slightly more too. I imagine these changes will disincentivize a lot of people from retiring early, so I’m not sure why they think some of these changes will yield any cost savings.",Tall_Pineapple9343,2025-04-29T08:28:09,8
Can we cut congressional salaries and benefits instead? They're not doing their jobs. They shouldn't get paid.,Ouibeaux,2025-04-29T07:52:31,9

They aren’t thinking about that at all. It’s just word play and misdirection.,luri7555,2025-04-29T09:27:23,3
