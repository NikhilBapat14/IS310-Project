Throwing people you don't like in prison just because you don't like them sounds like fascism...,Zerogates,2025-05-09T14:10:29,1247
"I have a liberal friend from church, when we started our friendship some 15 years ago he wasn't so Liberal but his wife certainly is and it has rubbed off on him a lot. Anyway, we try not to bring up politics but he has a habit of assume that everyone believes the same as him. I am not white and he is VERY white, so he will assume my political views sometimes based on Liberal assumptions that people of color all fall in line with the Liberal narratives.    Anyway, He brought up Elon and how I better not have any Tesla stock, I told him I do now. He looked at me shocked and said but he's a fascist, I asked him to explain what he meant and why he is a Fascist he was like don't you follow the news...    The other thing he just assumed that I would be against deportations, he knows my wife got her citizenship after we were married, she entered the country LEGALLY and we got married and after that she took her citizenship test and now is a proud American.    He said well given you and your wife's circumstances I thought you would be against what Trump is doing, I said Absolutely not, I said even more so, I said we did everything legally and right so why would we support those who don't especially gang members. I told him given my heritage I am even more against them being in the country illegally because of who they target, they tend to target their own kind, I said your son may not be influenced or affected by it in the long run but my son will be. He looked at me like if I was reading Mein Kampf",4thdegreeknight,2025-05-09T14:19:41,505
"Entirely emotional. No actual charges or reason why.  “We want him thrown in prison because……we just don’t like him, his support for Trump or MAGA, and his stupid DOGE project shaking up our way of life.”",ITrCool,2025-05-09T14:07:35,224

"This is nothing new. Since 2016, the democrats have wanted to throw Trump and every single one of us in prison for daring to step to the establishment that oppresses us. They’ve been saying since 2016 that every single one of us is a danger to this country, that we don’t deserve to be free men and women, and that we don’t deserve the right to life without due process condemnation. And as far as I’m aware, they won’t stop until every single one of us is eradicated from this world.",Ok-Willow-4232,2025-05-09T14:11:43,37

"That is insane. Not liking someone isn’t a reason to throw someone in prison. As someone said above , it’s an entirely emotional reaction  I wish the richest man in the world wasn’t hanging out in the Oval Office just due to the optics of it. But he’s an asset to the USA. We don’t want him building rockets for another country. He’s not a leach getting rich, he / his companies have changed our country in significant ways. I support him for that.  We aren’t paying Russia to fly our astronauts anymore and that is due to spacex.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-09T14:19:33,15
