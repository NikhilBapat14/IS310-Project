It was obvious that this second term was going to be nothing like the first.  The result of this is that he was underestimated (in terms of how willing he was to do these things) and got graded on such an insane curve by everyone that nobody actually took anything he said seriously (despite him being a former president, and multi-time candidate, which should have been enough to be taken seriously). All that‚Äôs happening now is that he‚Äôs executing on the things he openly said he would do on the campaign trail.

"Stop... stop blaming America as a whole, please... as I, an American, have been looking at the rest of the world, groups like Maga are honestly everywhere... hell, Canada has a good number of them, sadly.   I think the issue is that someone gains power somewhere, right? Then, they use that power to influence the area around them... now, they could use it for good, like funding public schools without a weird background request, agenda, or making the school use their specific tech... OR... they could start influencing things poorly... like book burnings, removing certain things from being studied, and so on... or also buying a media platform... then this person with all their greed gains the attention of other bad, greedy people.... and like a cancer, it grows almost uncontrollably...  Now, what happens next really sucks ass... due to the lower education in those areas, while probably taking taxes away from public schools and pushing them into private schools, so their child can be smart and successful, while another child who could be poor, for example, has even fewer resources now. All these various programs that help people usually end up bringing the lower class ... up.. helping people escape poverty, get decent educations without being in debt, etc... but instead, those are slashed in those small areas.   This epidemic happens in splotches everywhere, and it grows, again, like a cancer...   Basically, whenever you start to see education targeted by.. taking things away, it's a bad sign.. hilariously, if you see religion being forced in, it's also a bad sign, as has been shown literally worldwide...   Anyway, as an American married to a loving canadian, i hope any of this helps you understand that a small group can fuck over your whole country if it's left to fester...",OzzieGrey,2025-04-27T12:22:13,6

Americans are fighting (speaking to POWER, not to EACH OTHER -- we need to cross the aisle and gather support for the cause, not rage at our countrymen), but the billionaires own the media too.
