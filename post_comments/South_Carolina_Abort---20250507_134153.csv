"This is called a missed miscarriage. I had my second one of these 11 years ago, in Alabama. I was four months pregnant when I found out the baby had died.  My super religious doctor wouldn't perform a D&C, nor would he release me from his care so someone else could do it. Even after I passed out and wound up in the hospital, he refused to let me have one.  He forced me to carry my dead baby for two weeks. When he finally relented and scheduled me to have the procedure, he treated me like utter shit. As if I were somehow to blame for all this happening. His disgust with me in the OR was palpable.  It was a very traumatic experience. He died a couple of years after that from cancer. I hope he suffered.",MNWNM,2025-05-07T15:06:47,142

"medical intervention for a miscarriage IS referred to as abortion. let me say it again, miscarriages in the medical field ARE referred to AS ABORTIONS.   I’ve been repeating this for years. abortions are not 100% of the time someone who didn’t want to be pregnant; abortions ARE a LOT of the time occurring due to a complication/loss of pregnancy in which the woman’s life is at risk. some abortions literally SAVE lives.   total abortion bans are criminal IMO. abortion should ALWAYS be safe and accessible to women. it shouldn’t take women dying/almost dying to have access to that healthcare. I guess this is a controversial take these days but if you do not want to be pregnant, I do not think the government should force you to be. you and your doctor should explore your options because EVERY pregnancy is different. it’s not some black and white issue.",lauren23333,2025-05-08T04:34:05,4

"There’s these people talking about this story on another app and their only ‘argument’ is that “This is fake. It can’t be true because the idea that SC has a law that prevents a miscarriage D&C being done at early ultrasound to wait for a viable heartbeat is untrue”. I was just reading it and while I haven’t read it all yet, it does already say it without being explicit. It basically says that if a doctor performs an abortion with the reasonable medical knowing that it has a probability, even slight, of still being a viable pregnancy then the doctor can still be charged.
