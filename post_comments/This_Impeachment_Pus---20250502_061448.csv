"This guy has $800,000 in campaign debt and used the stunt to fund raise. Anyone who has been in Congress for 5 minutes know that he could never get it passed in a Republican House (if he could even get Speaker Johnson to get it on the floor for a vote) and would never get 67 votes in the Senate.  What a joke.",StedeBonnet1,2025-05-02T07:03:53,146

Maybe next time (and you KNOW there will be a next time) they shouldn't have their front person be an animal abusing freak.,BohdiOfValhalla,2025-05-02T11:06:22,16
"What we are witnessing is the Elite unable to cope with an outsider being elected.  The continued effort to undermine and thwart a duly elected president in every possible way is a huge middle finger to the voting population.  Those who don't support Trump need to take note as well, because this behavior by the elite will be extended to someone a non-Trump supporter likes in the future, who is an outsider; for example, see Bobby Kennedy Jr.",letmeinfornow,2025-05-02T06:26:32,101
"The entire left platform is just anti-Trump. They have built their cult and identity off hate. That's it. That's all they have. No answers, no electable politicians, no plans, nothing.   Leftists are a plague to the democrats who have catered to the extreme ideas and hatred. They are drowning and desperate.",chances906,2025-05-02T06:38:34,97

"The funniest(?) thing to me is when he went on Piers Morgan and the guy just completely fell apart when asked the most basic questions about why he filed in the first place, and started strangely saying something about poll numbers.  It’s one thing to pull a stunt, but if you’re gonna pull a stunt like that how could you not even at least have bullshit answers prepared for the most basic questions you have to know you’re going to be asked?  The entire panel wound up roasting the guy, and his performance was so bad that even that tub of shit from TYT was laughing at him.",LysanderSpoonersCat,2025-05-02T09:12:58,46
I really and truly think the whole overreaction to COVID in 2020 was an opportunistic attempt to unseat Trump and the type upheaval of the establishment he represents.,Creeepy_Chris,2025-05-02T06:34:45,91

"Absolutely.   He had beaten impeachment,  the economy was great and he was going to cruise.  Covid was a massive opportunity,  but they ALWAYS overplay their hand.  The emotionality with which they view the world and makes them leftists to begin with almost demands they go full tilt.   All of which directly led to Trump winning the popular vote.",TedriccoJones,2025-05-02T16:56:33,8

"Bernie is, and has been for a long time now, a lapdog of the elite.  They trot him out from time to time to work up the hard leftist lemmings, but never let him off his leash.  He is 100% inside the elites circle.  He is also a complete POS.",letmeinfornow,2025-05-02T09:12:39,29
