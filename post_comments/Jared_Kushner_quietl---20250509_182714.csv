"Lucky Jared - gets $2 billion untaxed dollars for his brilliant advice to the Saudis and MBS-a hacksaw murderer. The rapist traitor said publicly that the Saudis owe him because he stopped the investigation of the murder of J. Khashoggi. The best part is that the Saudis have bought the rights to the water in Arizona so they can have golf courses in the desert (some of these leases are being stopped but not all).   The war in Gaza is more about a land grab than Oct. 7 - something that Bibi was warned about weeks before it happened - but he has been a war monger for decades and used the attack to justify razing Gaza for his and rump's profits. No I do not stand with Hamas but I surely do not stand with those who murdered 50,000 people on the grounds that they were all terrorists. Were all the journalists, relief organizations and doctors - all precisely targeted - terrorists - no. Speaking the truth does not equal hate speech.   #",Maoleficent,2025-05-09T18:50:21,8
