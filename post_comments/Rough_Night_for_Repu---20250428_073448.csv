"> Mr. Lawler took a turn shaking his head when members of the audience chanted “Tax the Rich,” a liberal rallying cry in opposition to Republicans’ plan to extend and expand Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.  >“Folks, taxing the rich is not going to close our budget deficit,” he said, offering a discursive explanation about why cuts to federal spending would be more effective.  Hell, idefc if it *doesn't* solve the budget. Make them pay their *fair* share like the rest of us. It's not like they can't fucking afford it!",KungFuSnafu,2025-04-28T08:17:49,45
Wow. Starts the town hall off with some grade school bullshit when there are serious issues that need to be discussed. What a fucking coward.,addled_and_old,2025-04-28T07:43:03,23
"The ""democrat agitators did all the yelling"" that will predictably flood social media today is getting pretty tired especially when the Republican dipshits holding the town hall absolutely 100% personally know a lot of the people asking questions and shitting on trump  Lawler absolutely knows the crowd was mostly pissed Republican voters but he, like all the others, is too chickenshit to publicly object to anything trump does  Mid terms are going to be a fucking slaughter",ElPlywood,2025-04-28T07:45:43,28
"From the article:  *“No one was expecting a love fest when Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, faced constituents in his suburban swing district on Sunday night. Still, even he seemed surprised by the night’s first clash — over the Pledge of Allegiance.*  *“Please tell me you’re not objecting to the Pledge of Allegiance,” Mr. Lawler asked incredulously after some members of the audience inside a high school auditorium audibly groaned when he suggested reciting it.*  *They acquiesced, and several hundred attendees labored to their feet to say the pledge, but not without indicating why they believed its words had come to ring hollow.*  *“Authoritarian!” one man yelled, an apparent reference to President Trump.*  *“Support the Constitution!” bellowed another.”*",mgwccnv,2025-04-28T07:36:41,24

Lawler knows that the golden age needs to come before the next midterms.  Lawler also knows that the market got hurt bad and will not recover by then.  Lawler probably already planning his retirement party for around the holidays.,kmp11,2025-04-28T08:52:31,3

"Dems should take the lead on this and very adamantly demand the Pledge be recited - in its original written form by Minister Francis Bellamy - every morning by every student in the U.S. But only if it’s in Minister Bellamy’s original form and not the 1954 revision. Stress that it was disrespectful to change the Minister’s original version and since he was a man of God, that’s surely how God wanted it written.",scrume71,2025-04-28T12:02:21,0

Isn’t it a bit weird to force grade school kids to pledge their allegiance anyways?,Ok-Tourist-511,2025-04-28T08:25:15,12
Calling your republican constituents democratic agitators is a fantastic way to keep their votes.,ShyHuhLewd,2025-04-28T11:41:07,5
why the fuck do you need to say the pledge of allegiance before a town hall,ElPlywood,2025-04-28T07:41:09,22

"If you take taxes on the rich to wartime levels, like 90%+ it can harm investment. But that's absurdly unlikely. They are just being pissy little bitches at the little people trying to reduce their power over us.",PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-28T09:24:09,5
