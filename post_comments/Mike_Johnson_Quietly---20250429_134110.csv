"Not surprising. What is going to make it bad is some on the left will then use this to blast Democrats for 'doing nothing' when Johnson is using every lever, button and weapon he has to stop them. Don't get me wrong, Schumer can take his 'sternly worded letter with hard questions' and fly off to la la land. But people have also got to realize that there isn't a huge amount the Democrats can do right now, not having control anywhere. I recently had an interaction on Threads where someone was blasting congressional Democrats for 'not stopping Trump's EO's'  I asked them what they were supposed to do... and Johnson won't let anything come to a vote, and even if it did it would die in committee since Republicans control the House. The response was ""Excuses... stop him watch people not vote in 2026!!""  Which of course... just means more of the same.",WebRepulsive8329,2025-04-29T14:07:09,97

Elections have consequences buttercups, you should have voted more wisely and voted your ass off. Democrats don't have the numbers to do much when you decided to protest vote or abstain for ""reasons"". I'm dismayed by the lack of political brinkmanship and bipartisan strategy from the Democrats, but expecting them to have some sort of effective means of stopping anything when they're in the minority and captive to a complicit Republican party is a bit delusional. I'm mainly chuckling at these citizens screeching about this because again, they just don't understand how anything works or have enough respect for their freedom, rights, and democracy to be bothered with watching a fucking YouTube video that explains this shit like they're 5.   Schumer can get fucked, but until we have an opportunity to vote more Democrats into office during the midterms (if we have them at all, or at least with integrity) we are massively shit out of luck regarding any hard actions the Democrats can take.
