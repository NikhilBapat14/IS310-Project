">U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued an injunction in March on behalf of 23 states that sued the federal government after the White House moved to pause aid to states, ruling that the move ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúfundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government.‚Äù  >On Friday, McConnell found that the Trump administration disregarded the court order, with at least 19 states, all of whom with Democratic attorneys general, presenting ‚Äúundisputed evidence‚Äù that they were not receiving FEMA funds already appropriated by Congress.  *""fundamentally undermines the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government""*  Republicans oppose the constitution. They don't belive in having a constitutional republic. They *want* a king.   Failure to fully accept this truth is why democrats always seem to be bringing a procedural manual to a gun fight.",MrYdobon,2025-04-12T15:02:24,125

He's just pushing it more and more and more and it's almost like he's daring somebody to arrest him. Which would of course lead to that person being tried for treason rather than Trump,G0-G0-Gadget,2025-04-12T20:12:32,5
