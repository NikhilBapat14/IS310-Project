"[Here is the order in full.](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25938651-afge-v-trump-order/)  Noteworthy summary from the order:  “In sum, no statute gives OPM, OMB, or DOGE the authority to direct other federal agenciesto engage in large-scale terminations, restructuring, or elimination of itself. Such action is faroutside the bounds of any authority that Congress vested in OPM or OMB, and, as noted, DOGE has no statutory authority whatsoever.”",EntropicDismay,2025-05-10T16:54:11,1
