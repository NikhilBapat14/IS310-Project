"With Trump, I assume the worst, underhanded motive -- that's usually spot on. This might have been Trump's insult to the beloved late Pope in return for the dust-up about VP Mascara's ignorant remarks about St. Augustine's ""order of love"" providing a convenient excuse for terminating foreign aid \[and its recipients, btw\]. Pope Francis responded strongly at that time.  Trump is not a Christian, it's just a disguise for his ignorant, ill-informed base. Trump's ""spiritual advisor"" Paula White-Cain preaches a hateful extension of the prosperity gospel, namely, not only are the rich blessed by God, but the poor are being punished by God for their misdeeds. That provides a convenient, if heretical and false, justification for terminating aid to those in need.   Oh, and she sells blessings for >$1,000 on her website -- warning that if you don't pay the extortion, ""something might happen"" to you.
