If you want to go down some wild rabbit holes look up what Palantir does and the people who run it.,ShrimpieAC,2025-05-05T18:40:26,44
"""Early Palantirians understood the ethical weight of building these technologies,"" the thirteen former employees wrote in the letter. ""These principles have now been violated, and are rapidly being dismantled at Palantir Technologies and across Silicon Valley.""  Uh, what? I am pretty sure Thiel has never understood the ethical weight of a goddamned thing.   That said, good for these folks for speaking out. It can't be easy given who they are speaking out against.  And I'm glad to see Palantir finally getting some of the attention it deserves. People are always focused on Trump, and I get why, but it is hard to understate how evil PT and this company are. They should be facing way more scrutiny than they get.",Bitter-Flounder-3546,2025-05-05T18:43:45,19
A bunch of libertarians who got rich creating a tool for an authoritarian police state to take away everyone’s liberty.,Containerstorejams,2025-05-05T20:08:49,7

"Y...You're... You're the ones who chose to work for a company named after a magical item in a book series that had its primary associations with the villainous entity who used them to see the world outside of his tower to commit evil against it. What the *fuck* did you think was gonna happen??? What did you think this shit was gonna be used for? Benevolence? Why the fuck would they name it 'Palantir', then???",Uturuncu,2025-05-05T21:12:18,5

"At no point in time was Palantir a ""good"" company. None of these people can claim, with a straight face and in honesty, that they didn't realize they were working for a company run by power-hungry technofascists looking to make the world a worse place for everyone but themselves.",Prior-Tea-3468,2025-05-05T21:27:16,3
There was no point at which the unethical aspirations and intentions of Palantir and its founds were not widely known and understood.,tmdblya,2025-05-05T20:18:53,2
"The Nerd Reich and Dystopia Now podcasts have some really info on Thiel, Musk, Yarvin, and all the rest of that disturbing ilk.    So does the Book of Revelations.",IJustLookLikeThis13,2025-05-05T22:33:50,2
"Here's some inside info. Worked with some palantir data and interfaces. Imo, what I saw is almost worthless. An api that aggregates mostly useless dirty data. We couldn't even find a way to integrate it it's so crap and the company paid millions for access. I get they see scary and all and I'm sure there's that aspect hidden away, but what I've seen is vaporware investor bait that does almost nothing, and is mostly just same API's for publically available data.",notbadhbu,2025-05-05T21:42:34,1
"former, so they don't care.",justaheatattack,2025-05-05T22:27:47,1
Anyone that volunteered to work for them is a piece of shit anyway.  It's not like they were hiding the evil with the name.,SnooCupcakes7018,2025-05-05T22:42:33,1

Look up Curtis Yarvin and the dark enlightenment. There really is no tldr version of that that does justice to it...better to read it yourself. It's not exactly hidden; Wikipedia will give you the gist of it.,Bitter-Flounder-3546,2025-05-05T18:46:16,21
They make the targeting systems used in Gaza.  The ones that equate children as fighters.  They either make very bad faulty tech or very evil tech. I’ve heard a mix of both.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-05T18:46:42,12

For a party that is so obsessed with the deep state they sure elected it into office.,menagerath,2025-05-05T19:49:10,11
It wouldn't surprise me if Peter Thiel legit thinks of himself as Sauron reborn.,LordSiravant,2025-05-06T07:29:49,2
Yarvin is horrific but not involved with Palantir. Theil just likes what he says.,timbervalley3,2025-05-05T19:17:51,12

"Yes, true. I mentioned it because of Thiel's role in co-founding Palantir, but you're right that the company isn't directly related to Yarvin. I confess I'm less familiar with Palantir itself, except that they appear to be involved in a lot of very questionable surveillance  activities (as the article OP posted gets at).",Bitter-Flounder-3546,2025-05-05T19:29:29,5
" Eh, that’s like saying nuclear weapons are t bad, they’re just used in bad ways. Yeah, technically right, but also misses the point that any weapon, while not inherently bad, becomes bad in the hands of man, which is every weapon known to man.",Myrtle_Nut,2025-05-05T19:48:27,3
"Someone from Tlön went to go work there, I know this because... reasons. I wouldn't be surprised to find them on this list of people objecting.   Anyway, I subscribed to /r/YarvinConspiracy just to find out what all the fuss is about, and this is far from confirmation that Marvin has something to do with Pandora or whatever it is we're talking about here.",yebyen,2025-05-05T22:46:20,4

That is a fascinating subreddit that I did not know about until now. I just want to recommend it to other people who might read this. Just be prepared--going down this particular rabbit hole is not easy to come back from.,Bitter-Flounder-3546,2025-05-06T07:25:45,2
"A) That’s beside the point. Pick something like sarin gas instead, or novichok.   B) MAD has worked for about 70 years. Let’s not premature crown nukes.

"I got to know the man via Urbit once, I didn't think he was all they made him out to be. But I'll admit, I don't read what he writes off-Urbit. And he's not really on Urbit anymore, so my entire schtick is practically a thinly veiled advertisement for Urbit.  Shop at \~del's planet store.
