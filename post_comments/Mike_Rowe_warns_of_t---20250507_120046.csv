">Rowe claims over 7 million working-age men have left the labor forceRowe claims over 7 million working-age men have left the labor force  ***If you're looking for these people,*** you can find some of them in the underground/roadside markets where they've plied their skills for the past 20 years while blue economic deserts have rendered the aboveground markets barren.  My town has an under-construction shopping center frozen in construction, multiple completed shopping centers with no tenants, a falling-apart minimall with every other unit out, the abandoned husk of another minimall, *one 35-year-abandoned ruined parking lot where a defunct anchor store burned itself for insurance fraud,* one burger cluster by the freeway onramp, *and it has entire hundreds of little prop-up canopies where people sell hot meals school supplies toys airsoft paintball and designer jewelry.* I was thinking hobby jewelry could scrounge me up some change in the canopy market but when I did my homework I found there were already multiple good people doing it locally.  People in this town very clearly want to work, there's just no stacking blocks on top of each other in this regulatory environment (and whatever else needs to be done to run a business.) Therefore there's no brick&mortar establishments operating, therefore there's no brick&mortar *activity -* **no real jobs**. Get a little old pickup and an easy-up, then either fire up a grill or start peddling goods you can pick up wholesale. (The latter was how someone first tried to mentor me into swapmeeting in the 2000s.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T14:19:11,11
