"I watched the entire thing. They suspended for probably 25 minutes to find out if Crocket's insinuation that MTG was insider trading could be struck from the record. It couldn't. And they're in charge of the hearing.   If you want to see how fucked government is right now, watch it. She bangs the gavel over herself multiple times, makes up rules, denies the basic fact of time, and has her mic 200% louder than anyone else.  To be clear, this whole hearing was about a single trans person at a single fencing match, which receives no money from the government.   DOGE",rwjehs,2025-05-07T19:35:47,1074
"From the article:  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) banged her gavel almost 50 times in an effort to silence Ranking Democratic member Melanie Stansbury (N.M.) during a House subcommittee hearing Wednesday afternoon.  The hearing, which focused on trans women in sports, devolved into heated crossfire between Democrats and Republicans on multiple occasions.  However, the hearing got especially intense when Stansbury began speaking over her allotted time, which led to Greene, who is chair of the subcommittee, to interrupt the Democratic member.  “The gentlelady’s time is expired,” Greene told Stansbury, who continued to speak over her.  When Stansbury accused Greene of going over a minute into her time, Greene fired back that Stansbury “wasted” a minute of her time “on a non-point of order” and attempted to recognize Rep. Lisa McClain (R-Mich.).  Still, Stansbury refused to stop talking, which led Greene to bang her gavel repeatedly.  “Time was not wasted,” she said, with Greene still gaveling. “And to the trans community, we stand with you, with the LGBTQ+ community, we stand with you.”  “You can break my eardrums all you want, Madam Chair,” she added, speaking louder. “But we stand with the LGBTQ+ community and you can gavel me until the cows come home and it won’t stop it.”  Greene bangs gavel almost 50 times to quiet Democrat in House hearing",kootles10,2025-05-07T19:33:05,179

"I watched the hearing as my kids have been in fencing and know a bit about the case.   I think there is a case to be made that there should be further restrictions on trans athletes in some competitions/sports. I don’t agree with the case but there are some valid points.   However, there is no way to have watched that hearing and come away supporting the Republic committee members point of view. Only one member asked any questions (Burchett). The rest gave no space for testimony and only seemed interested in shouting down any replies.   I haven’t watched any other hearings from this committee or any other.

"First off we have to play their game. (Unless we flip the board over but that invokes an entirely different game) That is the consequences of our system of government.    Secondly, saying they want government to be ground to a halt, is a surprisingly difficult concept to untangle.    They certainly want the democratic, and public service aspects of the government to be useless. But they're fully in favor of the authoritarian and corrupt elements (as far as they benefit them) to hum along.    So yeah gumming down the works of the government feels icky, at least when all parties are well meaning.    But if we don't grow up and use it strategically to slow down the growth of facisim. Grinding to a halt a patricular mechanism of the goernment if someone is trying to use it spread facisim seems valid to me. Otherwise it'd soon be board flipping time.",WonLastTriangle2,2025-05-07T23:23:26,16
