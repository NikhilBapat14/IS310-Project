"""Only 39%""? That's still a lot of idiots.   Shooting yourself in the foot is not something anyone should approve of.",bytemage,2025-04-29T06:12:45,50
"I’m honestly convinced half our country has the collective IQ of a goldfish.   He was FULLY OPEN about his intentions from day one, HELL even before then. We knew what his plans were and yet our country wanted this maniac elected anyways.   and now they go “oh well that’s not what we meant we said deport them all and tariff everyone.   THEN WHAT DID YOU MEAN.",EvieParkour,2025-04-29T06:04:58,25
What's shocking is that 39% of Americans support Trumputin destroying the American economy.  Propaganda works.,1-Ohm,2025-04-29T06:10:17,12
"Way too high.  39% of Americans are disastrously propagandized, dumb, or a healthy dose of both.",Stranger-Sun,2025-04-29T06:42:25,9

"39% is still too high for the level of damage this man has done. But as we all know, his fervent Maga supporters are never going to lose his support.   But the majority is basically in a free fall. Literally last week the last pole I saw that showed us popularity was at 44%.  Also it's gonna go down amongst his supporters when his policies and actions result in people dying. From poor healthcare to stripping away food stamps... Doesn't matter how popular you are amongst a group. If said group ain't even around to cheer you on.",Virtual-Pie5732,2025-04-29T07:55:12,2
It's important to keep in mind that \~30% of the people responding would sya Trump was doing a good job even if they were somehow expressing their opinion after Trump had destroyed the world in nuclear fire.,obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-29T10:32:19,2
"They are all likely broke ass MAGAs who never enjoyed a good economy themselves, and hate seeing an immigrant succeeding where they couldn’t.  However, wait until their SS checks don’t show up and then repeat this poll.",yorapissa,2025-04-29T11:12:17,2
"Polls are lagging indicators and people honestly haven't experienced the pain yet. This is largely people saying ""hey! eggs are still expensive, what gives!"" As shelves empty and  prices increase even more you're going to see this number collapse.",Round-Rule5494,2025-04-29T06:44:39,15
"Trump promises to play stupid games, and he promises to win genius prizes. His voters believed him on both counts. They were half right.",BaronGrackle,2025-04-29T07:40:50,3
