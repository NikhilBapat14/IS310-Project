"I can't believe people are still buying the junk from that place. I thought everyone tries it once, finds out it's just junk and never goes back.",DaRiddler70,2025-05-02T22:17:41,56
I can finally be free from these awful temu ads.,whippingboy4eva,2025-05-02T19:08:19,119

Good hopefully it will stop some counterfeit coins from hitting the market.,Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-02T18:23:50,113
"My wife ordered two things from one of those sites. I can't remember if it was Temu or Wish or Alibaba but whatever it was, it was absolute garbage; just useless junk, so shoddily made that she couldn't even use it. It took up space until she eventually threw it away.  Whenever I walk through Walmart nowadays, I look around in disgust at how much useless, cheaply made garbage is flooding into this country. These tariffs are a step in the right direction. We need quality over quantity.",JoeWinchester99,2025-05-02T21:31:12,69
Shit is starting to get real in China.    China does not have a market to replace the USA.   Because it simply does not exist.    You think debt in the USA is bad.   China is worse.   And we are not even going to get into China's population implosion.,old---,2025-05-02T19:02:01,187

"Good. My daughter is gonna be born in June and my mother keeps buying shit clothes from there. Iâ€™ve told her many many times to stop not only from their quality being bad, but also how often temu crap is literally covered in lead and other toxic chemicals.",Lord_Gibby,2025-05-02T20:47:43,44
They should also halt the spyware they install when you download the app,sowellpatrol,2025-05-02T23:05:21,11
Thank god. Probably 90% of all advertising on twitter just went away. ðŸ˜‚,jcr2022,2025-05-02T22:37:21,9
Oh my....anyway,AppState1981,2025-05-03T09:12:35,4
I don't know where this tariff ride is going and I'd have implemented them much differently but it's worth it for all of the other benefits of this administration.,kaytin911,2025-05-02T18:45:11,32

"The change is not as much a trade strategy as it is an attempt to stop illegal shipments, according to the White House. The administration's release on the change pointed to drug smuggling as a primary issue.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T18:57:30,21

The 99% of Reddit that's leftist infested thinks that China is all powerful and kewl and doesn't need us at all.  They are absolutely gleeful at the prospect of a single empty store shelf which will surely turn America against Donald Trump and return the Democrats to glory.,TedriccoJones,2025-05-03T06:53:10,19
"I spent a winter processing clothing returns in an Amazon warehouse. The synthetic smell from all of that clothing was *bad.* It was rare to find anything made of cotton, or even a cotton blend. The quality was abysmal -- crooked seams, etc.   Look back at photos from the 1950s-60s and the way people dressed. We have lost so much.",Willow-girl,2025-05-03T06:47:50,9
Exactly this - pick organic materials that have zero synthetics in them. Won't find those as cheap imports from China.,_philia_,2025-05-03T02:53:58,4

"A buddy who used to work in the medical profession and I were walking past one of those fast fashion clothing stores and the odour coming out made him suddenly go ""formaldehyde"", as in the clothes have that on them to keep them from getting too wrinkled during transport.  So if your clothes have an odd odour, that's the stuff!",ussbozeman,2025-05-03T07:48:12,5
