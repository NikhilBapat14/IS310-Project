"That’s not true at all. The Republican majority is very small.  There’s a lot they could be doing. Leadership has made it clear they’re waiting for approval ratings to reach the point where republicans will cross Trump.  Basically they’re largely sitting on their hands. Why is it that when republicans are in a minority position they’re able to effectively fight?  I don’t buy this whole narrative that democrats are helpless here. Schumer is out of touch and nobody in power is willing to call out the leadership.  Jeffries filibuster should have been the event that triggered a change in tactics, but nope. Nothing has changed.

"I'd be fine if they went by the book. But they're not.  A perfect example is DeJoy. Now, IMO there was ample grounds to remove him for cause. But fine, you don't want to even slightly go outside established norms and appear to, in some people's minds, overreach. So then the completely by the book, normal, routine way to remove him would just to be to nominate new governors who wanted to replace him in due course of filling the vacancies that occur due to the normal expiration of terms. But **Biden refused to even do that.** He *chose* people who supported DeJoy. So DeJoy remained even after Biden's nominees became a Senate-confirmed majority.  What's especially irritating are the Democrats who never bothered to update their excuse making so to this day still excuse it with ""bUt He CoUlDn'T fIrE hIm"" which to the extent it was ever true, stopped being so 2 years in.",fafalone,2025-04-28T09:40:08,5

The ones who aren't get laughed at by Republicans for not capitalizing on their positions more.

"This is such utter, transparent nonsense.  As a quick test as to what they care about look at the last couple times each party had a trifecta and what they did:  1) GWB: cut taxes for rich people. 2) Obama: expanded health care access for the sick and poor. 3) Trump: cut taxes for rich people. 4) Biden: expanded child care funding for poor people and invested in infrastructure.
