"""glam countertop""  Let's talk about that shall we?  Well, let's jut talk about ""glam"" in the military.  I've sometimes thought that the US Air Force should have a squadron of A-10 Thunderbolt II close air support planes crewed exclusively by WOMEN, painted Mountbatten Pink and, instead of those ""shark teeth"" noses would have sparkly unicorn nose art (or maybe fin flashes -- or both).  The A-10 ladies would be going about their prosaic, day-to-day close air support business of **mopping** things up (as WOMEN are meant to do) and suddenly an enemy fighter would come upon them.  The enemy, noticing the girly unicorns and pink paint would laugh but them Blam!, BLam!, GLAM! The Warthog ladies would show the enemy what 30mm of depleted U238 can do.  Not laughing so much any longer, eh?  And, just like from the beginning of time when a kiddo upchucks, the Warthog lady would go back to the thankless task of mopping up the mess on the ground.",Catspaw129,2025-04-24T22:38:32,2
