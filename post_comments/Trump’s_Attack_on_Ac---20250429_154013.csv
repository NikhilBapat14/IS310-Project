Trump’s flimsy “data” on an alleged ActBlue “fraud” comes from a dark money super-PAC bankrolled by Elon Musk.,Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-04-29T15:41:54,67
"This isn't surprising at all. This is what the GOP does. They lie, point fingers, and then do exactly what they accuse the Dems of doing.",Happy_Weed,2025-04-29T16:18:59,29
">Republicans quickly touted the order as cracking down on hidden sources of funds in US elections. “The Democrats’ Dark Money scam has gone on long enough,” Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley [said](https://www.instagram.com/p/DI2KLXUtZtR/) last week.  Wow. If it weren’t for double standards, Republicans would have no standards at all.  Ever since the Roberts Court’s disastrous *Citizens United* ruling, the GOP and its regressive enablers—like the corrupt Heritage Foundation, Federalist Society, and a slew of shady 501(c)(4) fronts—have been drowning in dark money. That flood of untraceable cash has fueled their power grabs and an ongoing coup against democracy.  And yet, these GOP narcissists expect us to believe *ActBlue*, which is transparently funded by small, individual donors, is somehow the real beneficiaries of dark money?
