Theater is all this is and cruelty. Garcia was at Home Depot in the parking lot looking for odd jobs to provide for the American girl he impregnated and her two American children with special needs.

"This is about due process.  This is about our democracy.  In this trying time, what we need is a leader that can inspire us.

Someone that'll inspire us to do the right thing and bridge the gap created by social media algorithm, so that we can be united as one nation.  And still we have these professional politicians ""strategizing"" over what is the right ""strategy"" to win the most amount of power, and when they do so, they use the power for their own personal gains.  No, this isn't the kind of politician we need. We need someone who can stick to the principles and uphold what is written in our constitution.

"To add to that, this isn’t just about deportation without due process, it’s about incarceration in a foreign prison without due process.",Jumpy-Coffee-Cat,2025-04-22T08:25:23,13
"I think what is fucked up is, as Jumpy-Coffee-Cat pointed out, that he is not just being deported, but is being sent to basically a foreign death camp despite his only wrongdoing being that he left his home country to find a safe place to live.  Legally speaking, the Trump admin does not have to prove he is MS-13 or that he's a bad guy or anything like that.  All of that is irrelevant, legally speaking.  The only reason it has been relevant in the past is because they used this line of reasoning to keep him incarcerated rather than release him pending his hearing.  However, if they want to deport him now all they have to do is show that the circumstances in El Salvador have changed and that the stay of his deportation is no longer warranted.  Given that, allegedly, the gang that was targeting his family no longer exists, the court could certainly rule that his stay should be lifted and that he should be deported to El Salvador.  That being said... with the fact that the Trump admin is not just sending people to their home country, but is sending them to a death camp, I don't think that should be the bar anymore.  Not just for him, but for anyone they are deporting.  There is a big difference between the US saying, ""Look, you're not here legally, so we have to send you back to your own country and you can't live here anymore,"" versus the Trump admin saying, "" You're here illegally, so we're sending you to a maximum security prison in another country despite the fact that you've committed, no crimes, and we certainly haven't convicted you of any crimes, which would warrant your incaceration.  In fact, we're paying the dictator of that country to keep you incarcerated and there is nothing you can do about it.""",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T09:38:56,3

"Wow, I didn’t know he was charged with beating his wife. Big if true. (It’s not true.) That’s also not why he was deported so it’s hardly relevant.

"Then I would have the horrifying knowledge the GOP would undoubtedly win and have to find someone else to use as the face to bring back everyone. Because, again, this is about the optics of persuading America to turn on Trump's dictatorship and you need to play the propaganda game.

"Then he obviously needs to be dealt with to the fullest extent of the applicable law. There should be zero tolerance for domestic violence or, indeed, active gang membership. But, crucially, that's not something the President or an individual law enforcement officer can just decide and declare on a whim because they feel like it. They have to follow the legal process, and if he's accused of a crime, he needs to be charged with it and given the ability to face his accuser and defend himself. If he's then found guilty, by all means, lock him up and throw away the key, or even deport him, if that's what the law allows. Domestic abusers don't deserve anything less. But right at this moment, he has not been charged with, let alone found guilty of, any crime whatsoever.   The right wing is trying to spin a narrative that this is about Mr Abrego Garcia as a person. It's not. Mr Garcia is just a placeholder for every single legal resident in the United States, whether that is an asylum seeker, Green Card holder or US citizen. Because whatever the outcome of the Garcia case is becomes precedent for 350 million people currently residing in the United States.   If your mother feels very strongly about this, I would tell her that this could be her. Or you for that matter. You could get snatched from the street, put on a plane to El Salvador and there would be nothing anyone could do to bring you back as things currently stand.

"There is really no way to find out that he is because there is no cause that has been adjudicated that has ruled that he is a wife beater.  There were some filings for restraining orders, but those were dropped were otherwise never litigated.  An accusation does not mean that a person is guilty.  Which really just gets us right back to the due process argument.  A lot of accusations have been levied against Garcia, but almost none of them have been adjudicated.  Despite the fact that none of the accusations have been adjudicated, he's still been sent to a maximum security prison for the rest of his life.  Is that really how we want our country and justice system to work?    Also, another part of the constitution protects against cruel and unusual punishment.  Another way to put that is that the punishment must fit the crime.  So, even if he is found guilty of being a 'wife beater,' does that warrant life in prison in one of the world's most dangerous and cruel prisons?",WhatRUHourly,2025-04-22T09:47:27,2
"The lack of consistent standards is also tiresome. If people were consistent in their belief that scumbags don’t need all their due process, that would be something I guess. I would strongly disagree but applying that standard consistently would be something. Instead, people might concede that the optics around a person they like aren’t ideal but they’ll say “well, he’s not perfect, but hey I believe everyone should get their full legal rights and day in court.” And then with a person they don’t like: “he sucks, who cares about allowing all of his legal rights.” If conservatives won’t defend all the trial rights of people they happen not to like, I’m going to run out of patience defending the trial rights of anyone affiliated with MAGA. ",StormOk7544,2025-04-22T09:08:18,3

If a final determination had been made to deport him, this would have been communicated to him and he would have presumably been taken into custody pending removal from the country.   But in the context of this case, it doesn't even matter.
