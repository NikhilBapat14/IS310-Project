"You may recall when Donny ordered all government workers who were working from home to return to the office.  Donny did not trust these employees to put in a full days work without supervision.  So Donny, in a perfect example of leadership, takes a weekday off to play golf.  Friday, April 4, to be precise.  The day the stock market suffered it's biggest loss in 5 years, and the entire world is involved in a trade war, initiated by Donny himself, in which there will be no winner.  Hire a clown, you get a circus.",dirtythoughtdreamer8,2025-04-04T21:08:05,34

"What is the good faith explanation for the tariffs? Like, how does Trump Co benefit from any of this? Is he pocketing the (supposedly) increased tax revenue somehow? And if so, wouldn't there be a less-PR-damaging way of doing so?  I don't believe the goal is to simply destroy the economy, because he's not interested in anything that doesn't directly benefit him.   So what's the plan here? Is it really just Russian influence? Even that I don't quite believe because there's probably way more money to be made by Trump if he just helped grow the economy and earmarked a shitload of tax revenue for his companies and pals...?",SjurEido,2025-04-04T22:56:42,1

It‚Äôs the fault of the Democrats we voted in for this. If the working class was on their mind at all in the last 20 years they would have been able to prevent this with a common sense candidate instead of the swill at the bottom of Biden‚Äôs repugnant chalice of regret. There is nothing we can do except hope we get another election but honestly we probably won‚Äôt and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs actually fucking horrible and inane we must live through this but it‚Äôs what this God forsaken mess of a republic deserves don‚Äôt @ me.,yt_phivver,2025-04-04T21:49:26,-7

"The ""working class"" is certainly never on Republicans' minds, yet they find ways to get votes--despite Biden being the first president to join union workers on a picket line. It's also interesting that when it comes to demographics, Black working class voters in particular routinely get the message and support Dems overwhelmingly while other people back MAGAs despite their utterly toxic economic platform.",jml510,2025-04-04T22:49:10,4
