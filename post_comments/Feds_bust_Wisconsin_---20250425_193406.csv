"This is extreme bullshit and will not stick.   If a bunch of cops from an unrelated agency and jurisdiction show up in a judge's courtroom during a hearing, and the judge doesn't immediately comply with their whimsies to their satisfaction, that's obviously not a crime.    It's the judge's courtroom and they can take their unrelated business outside.",KriosXVII,2025-04-25T19:42:45,26
https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-post/  >Overall we rate the New York Post on the far end of Right-Center Biased due to story selection that typically favors the Right and Mixed (borderline questionable) for factual reporting based on several failed fact checks.,BukkitCrab,2025-04-25T19:47:12,13
"Wanna know what people mean when they say biased journalism uses loaded wording and editorialized reporting? Read that headline. It leads one to believe that guy punched the victim 30 times. He may have, but they completely leave out it was a mutual fight, not a one sided assault. It is also completely irrelevant to the story being reported.",blade944,2025-04-25T20:10:04,9

"They remained outside the courtroom and did not show up during a hearing. The judge confronted them outside the courtroom, told them to speak with the chief judge, went back inside, adjourned, and escorted the individual and his attorney to leave through the jury exit into a private corridor.

"We haven't heard Dugan or the county's account of the story yet, but there were a few things that I picked on.   > While Attorney B was busy preparing for that morning’s docket, Attorney B heard someone announce, “ICE is here.” Shortly thereafter, Attorney B heard Judge DUGAN say that she wasgoing to call the Chief Judge before leaving the courtroom.  Their non-silent presence was causing a distraction in the court room, which the Judge has to keep track of to ensure procedures are properly followed. Inside that courtroom was a Victim Witness Specialist, victims, and accused offenders that are necessary for  outcomes of trials needed to protect the public. One of the judge's duties is to ensure that those individuals, members of the public, etc., are safe. Naturally, I think it's very reasonable for a judge to respond a bit aggressively when a courtroom is echoing ""ICE is here"" with their very public appearance rippling through her courtroom and around witnesses about to testify. Not to mention, the personnel on hand. It sounds like a mess where the courthouse was *completely* put on the spot, the correct personnel to handle the legal ramifications had be *called on a cellphone,* Justice Dugan had to inform them where they could and could not operate (which is not her job in the first place), they had day-of co-ordination with her her supervisor, and all of that led to a non-routine and high-tension incident that a legal-minded individual would want to make sure is handled properly - for any errors could result in a lawsuit, judicial reprimand, a stripping of certifications, potential liability or criminal repercussions (as she is now seeing), and the exact massive MAGA mess we now see here involving an individual who has a solid career serving both the courts and the public.   >I am familiar with the floor plan for the sixth floor of the courthouse and believe the door Judge DUGAN entered led toa non-public hallway from which she could access her courtroom and chambers.26. DEA Agent B, who had remained in the hallway and had not been recognized as a member of the arrest team, reported that Judge DUGAN walked around the hallway and appeared to be looking for additional agents before she returned to her courtroom.  This is one of those things I picked up on: her checking non-public areas that another individual believed she was checking to make sure that there were not individuals who could not operate there. By becoming aware of their presence, due to lack of co-ordination, and potential other unmentioned details from Dugan's of the story, this witness was under the impression that she may have begun clearing the building for unlawful presences in private areas. Remember: it is partly her duty to ensure the safety of individuals in her court room and compliance with local, county, and state laws (which she could not do judicial review on in such a short period). In that period, she made efforts to ensure it was handled properly with her chief justice. Whether this influenced her decision to allow the exit through a door that's also used for ""detained individuals,"" which she was made aware of their intent to detain, we'd have to rely on her testimony or comments. Again, this is a legal-minded individual trying to juggle court cases, this case itself which could be in jeopardy of a mistrial depending on unknown and unidentified individuals in the building who did not identify themselves, a failure to co-ordinate with supervisors (including legal advice from the chief justice), etc.,  Further, unless there is a completely private exit that she authorized the individual to use and led the individual though - the door she led him out leads to a public areas where the warrant can be served regardless.",postsshortcomments,2025-04-25T23:19:25,3
