"I owe 50k in student loans. I went to wmu for accounting. I have a 3.6gpa, I dropped out as a senior. I saw rampant grade inflation. Most classes were easier then high school. I should say I took ap calculus in 12th grade. So I was good at school.  I wanted to dropout after my 2nd year but was afraid.  In 12th grade I wanted to do an apprenticeship in a skilled trade. My stepdad and grandparents told me that skilled trades are for losers and everyone is unemployed. Every teacher and counselor told Me the sane.  I'm starting welding school next week. It's 17 weeks and 40 hrs a week. I'm 31 years old.  HOWEVER IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY THE 50K. I DO NOT SUPPORT STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS.

"Get a degree that has the potential to **make** a higher income, and one is happy to pay off big loans.  It goes against the Instagram “living my best life” mentality, but one can still work summers in High School, save every penny, work full time summers during college, part time during classes, and maybe even live with Mom and/or Dad, and come out with a degree and zero debt.

"Because it’s predatory. They make it “affordable”, so people pay for decades on interest, with none of it going towards principle.  There needs to be an interest cap. Once the government has collected a certain amount of interest, it’s time to let the loan go by putting 100% of the payments towards the principle. Otherwise, people are in student loan debt for their entire lives while the government gets rich off of gullible 18-year-olds.  Yeah yeah, personal responsibility - pay off the loan you take out. I get it and normally agree. But these are literal kids taking out tens of thousands of dollar loans.

But the loans are predatory.  I agree about the responsibility you're talking about but the problem is we never apply this level of scrutiny and call for responsibility  when it comes to business and corporations.  Ever.   ",GorillaHeat,2025-04-22T06:20:22,94
"The problem with student loans is that they get special treatment when compared to other loans.

I agree that if you borrow money you should pay it back.

Especially not for the worthless overpriced pieces of paper that most institutions are printing nowadays.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-22T00:46:39,103
That’s not really the issue though. A whole generation of people were conned by the government and educational institutions. Where I don’t really blame parents not knowing when every single thing aligned with “college degree = only way to success.” Then they were forced into a corporate structure where you couldn’t even apply for a secretary position without a 4 year degree.   To simply tell an entire generation saddled with debt “too bad shouldn’t have borrowed” is a gross oversimplification of the problem. Not full debt forgiveness but the federal govt and universities should be held somewhat responsible and in some capacity.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-21T19:03:04,555
"Join the military for 4 years like the Air Force or Navy and get access to chapter 33 benefits aka Post 9/11 GI Bill. Also, college is paid for while you're active duty. Yes, the military is not for everyone. However, if you're of able body and mind, you can do 4 years in the Air Force or Navy just fine.  You can also go get your degree as a civilian and then sign up for an officer program and have your debt paid for with a service contract.

"Because if they were nobody could lend to students besides the government. There is no way to recoup the loss. A student can go for 4 years and still not graduate, making the money they spent useless. Nondischargable debt is the only way to allow anyone to go to college no matter how stupid they are or what garbage degree they want.   My college tried to shut down their library sciences degree because the average salary was 40k and required a masters degree. There was an outcry among the students and faculty so they kept it.   Back in the olden days, you had to go to a bank with your grades and major and they would decide if you would get a loan.",LeeroyJenkins11,2025-04-22T10:05:49,7

"In essence, you're arguing that we should give them taxpayer money now (student loan forgiveness) because they're going to make a lot of money later (and end up in a high tax bracket).

"Yeah, the whole program is brain-dead.  Very few lenders would lend money to 18 year olds without credit history and with low income.  So the government provides incentive (backing) to the lenders to loan the money.  But the government doesn't want to get stuck either, so they make them non-cancel-able in bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, the institutions don't have to worry about providing an effective education, because the government is willing to guarantee payments of *any amount* for an education of *any effectiveness*.  So tuition goes through the roof, while endowment funds reach record levels.  The right answer would have been to subsidize schools based on their success rate at raising people out of poverty via education, measured in the long haul.     If you want cost-effective education, reward the behavior that makes it cost-effective (the cost and the effectiveness).",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-22T07:45:43,27
"> They can't be discharged in bankruptcy  They can, but only under extreme circumstances.  >It's despicable that they are different from any other personal loan  It is not.

Sure. But in this case it’s an inescapable lesson that will ruin millions of people’s lives. Saddled with life long debt  which will mean being ridiculed for living with their parents longer.

Except bond yields are ~4.5% on the 10 year and the government won't come out ahead. Student loans are risky because they are not backed by assets. Do not take a loan you cannot or will not pay back. And it is insanity to say the government should guarantee loans that otherwise wouldn't be given privately. On top of that it massively drives up the cost of a higher education. Every single angle you cut this from it's a horribly stupid idea that only causes ruination.,cplusequals,2025-04-22T08:08:59,10

It can either happen now, with the cooperation of the older generation, or it can be forced off by the older generation being uncooperative... And it will still happen, but the impact on the older generation will be viewed even less sympathetically relative to the necessity of doing it.  You can either figure out a solution now, no matter how painful and hard to swallow it may be, or you can try and wait a decade or two for the millennial generation to become the dominant political power bloc and have a solution forced on you with no regard for how painful and hard to swallow you may find it.

"Lol, of boomers had the power to fuck over their kids, I guarantee you that millennials, who are an even bigger generational cohort, will have the same power.  And, much like how boomers don't view their actions as fucking over their kids, neither will millennials see what they do in that way.  And 39% of millennials have at least a four year degree.  That is by far more than enough to ensure that shit happens.  Especially when you consider that the percentage of Americans who needed something like Obamacare was far lower, almost single digit percentages, and it became a political rallying cry so powerful that nearly two decades later we still haven't been able to get away from it.  So, once again, there is no world where this doesn't happen sooner or later.  It's not a matter of if, but when, and how painful you want it to be.  I'm all for the scammers being held to account now and fixing the problem now, but again, that's not the point I'm making... The point I'm making is that the next generational cohort to wield power, millennials, will solve the problem, at least to their own satisfaction, one way or another.
