"From the article:  A federal judge has halted President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services – the agency which provides federal funding to libraries and museums across the country.  On March 14, Trump issued an executive order calling for the elimination ""to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,"" of seven government entities, including the IMLS. In response, attorneys general from 21 states sued the president to stop him from dismantling three of those agencies – the IMLS, the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.  District court Judge John J. McConnell Jr., who was nominated to the court by President Obama in 2011, issued an injunction on the EO Tuesday, stating that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act.  ""It also disregards the fundamental constitutional role of each of the branches of our federal government; specifically, it ignores the unshakable principles that Congress makes the law and appropriates funds, and the Executive implements the law Congress enacted and spends the funds Congress appropriated,"" McConnell wrote.",kootles10,2025-05-06T17:07:37,16
"Good. I told my Trump supporter dad the cuts were probably going to impact his beloved local rural library. He uses it for computer access and was not happy. Well, too late now, dad.",JRE_4815162342,2025-05-06T22:58:04,2

"Good.  On a related note: it turns out my local rural library is a Carnegie library and they still fund their libraries a hundred years later.  So, my library got the word out that we would not be affected much.  However, this does not apply to the rural libraries that were built later and not by the Carnegie Foundation.",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-06T17:20:22,12
