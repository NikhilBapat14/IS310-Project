"The article's use of passive voice is so annoying. ""Then came a scandal""   A scandal didn't come. They embezzled $10M from taxpayers.",ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-27T12:57:30,79
What's the statute of limitations on this crime?  Because Pam Bondi isn't going to do shit about this unless Ron makes trouble.,thingsorfreedom,2025-04-27T13:28:33,23
Normal Florida stuff.  Scammiest state in the country.  Lot of nice people there but simply the scammiest place in this country.  I speak from personal experience.  Carl Hiaasen called it quite a while ago.  No coincidence that Trump makes it his headquarters.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T13:59:13,11

"Maybe the Florida AG?  Oh wait, he ran the political committee that received $5.8M of this $10M scandal and then paid out $1.2M to Casey DeSantis PAC.   In case you wondered what it looked like for the fox to guard the henhouse.",NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-27T13:46:12,23
