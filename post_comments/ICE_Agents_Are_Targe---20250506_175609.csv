"I can verify this. Police vans lining U-Street (and other popular destinations on my route). ICE agents come in posing as I-9 inspections, trying to get in to non-public parts of the restaurant without a warrant. They're putting people out back in case people try to run.  And they're not just ""targeting illegals"" because they have no idea who is legal or not. They're harassing anyone brown. This is a wide net, not people who they think are illegal",Threeseriesforthewin,2025-05-06T18:00:50,52
Doesn't seem like they're going after MS13. I guess restaurants are easier.,30mil,2025-05-06T18:09:55,25

What about red states?,homebrew_1,2025-05-06T18:12:24,7
One of these plainclothes SS agents are gonna get shot soon and that‚Äôll be all the justification presi needs to create a police state. Mark my words,Rocket_League-Champ,2025-05-06T20:24:05,6
How about the people who hire illegals? How come they never get arrested? Not all illegals have fake SS numbers. many are paid under the table.,papaHans,2025-05-06T18:35:05,19
They‚Äôre sending in the losers that couldn‚Äôt make it in the actual military or federal law enforcement and have declared war on local restaurants. The history books will tell of the valiant heroes that fought at the Battle of North Applebees.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T18:12:01,8

"In Germany we once called those guys ‚ÄúGESTAPO‚Äù , shortcut for ‚ÄúGeheime Staatspolizei‚Äù means secret federal police . They did exactly the same in search of Jews and political opponents .",corvus66a,2025-05-07T05:15:53,8

"100%. They were never going to go after the gangs because guns. They just care about numbers and fear, so going after people who are working is easy and safe for ICE.",DaBingeGirl,2025-05-06T19:52:10,4
No. Only blue states are attacked by trump goons.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-06T18:27:35,18
Because they don't care about the illegality.  They need to feed racism and cruelty to their base of white nationalists.,Oi_cnc,2025-05-06T19:03:11,14
