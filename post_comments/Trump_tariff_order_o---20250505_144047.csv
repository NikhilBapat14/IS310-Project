">The entertainment industry reacted with a mixture of alarm and bafflement on Monday after President Donald Trump said he would put a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., but issued few details on just how such a levy would work.  How the hell do you put tariffs on entertainment itself?  Tariffs are placed on a good as a means of taxing the value of the good.  To place tariffs on something that isn't even a service seems completely illogical.  If they try to tax the ticket sales, that is just a sales tax, which I'm pretty sure does need to be approved by Congress (though don't let something as pesky as the law get in the way of this administration).  At best, they could put it on materials that are used in the making of the production but that just encourages production outside of the US.    I'm not saying I'm surprised they would make a useless announcement like this but it is surprising how few people even question these dumb as shit announcements.  If they are still trying to use these types of announcements to flood the zone, it seems like people are slowly waking up to the process and are not being so overwhelmed by the misinformation.",SelectIsNotAnOption,2025-05-05T17:04:04,1
Desperation knows no bounds.  We are saving hundreds of billions of dollars by eliminating trade with China according to him.  So no tariff money there.  Everyone else is cutting off trade with us too.  So no tariff money there either.  We are down to movies filmed outside the US.  The mental gymnastics required to classify this as a threat to national security and therefore under his fake power grab is huge!,grasshopper239,2025-05-05T17:43:02,1
