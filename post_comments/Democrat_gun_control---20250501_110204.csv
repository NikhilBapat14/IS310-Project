"The starting problem remains the DNC can't define ""Assault Weapon"" in any sensical way. SCOTUS has already warned the US Courts the AR15 as the most popular rifle in the US, is therefore in common usage, and therefore unbannable. These childish restrictions just haven't all been challenged yet, I expect all these BS laws to be soon removed.",AZULDEFILER,2025-05-01T14:35:06,15
Pretty sure that defining an assault weapon is a tough as defining a woman.,_Diggus_Bickus_,2025-05-01T14:56:43,12
"A common theme in liberal parties' policy platform is that they never actually ""solve"" the issue they profess to want to solve.   That would invalidate having that policy in their future policy platform at best, and at worst would show the policy to be a failure (eg, assault weapons ban doesn't stop mass shootings).   So we get consistent pushes for bills or policies without the intention to ever actually pass them or solve anything - assault weapons ban, nationally legal abortion, DEI for systemic racism, etc etc.  These aren't policies as solutions, these are policies to pimp their voters, often as a foil to the opposition party.  They have no intention to actually pass them in full, no intention to actually solve anything.  Overturning Roe v Wade was actually the Democrats' dream, for example.  Not because they want to ""solve"" the issue with a Congressional bill, but because they want an issue to scare their voters into voting for them.",CallMeCassandra,2025-05-01T11:16:54,28
"Stop calling it gun control and call it what it is... ""Democrats continue suggesting constitutional violations with reintroduction of weapons ban.""",MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-01T11:35:15,30
Common sense gun control… Don’t let democrats near firearms.  That would solve 90% of the problems right there.,daspes1269,2025-05-01T21:23:53,6
Semi-automatic sporting rifles are almost never used in mass shootings.,Squeezer999,2025-05-01T12:09:30,13
The 2A is one of the bastions of freedom that seems to be hated the most by the tyrants of today.,AstraVolans_21,2025-05-01T12:24:06,8

"They were successful once and next time they won’t allow a sunset date.   It sucks but until we get the Supreme Court to rule on this, our gun rights are just one election away from not being a thing anymore.",UpvoteMagnet99,2025-05-01T13:37:00,2
