"This is not a breakdown of the system. It is what the system was built to do. When success is measured by how much wealth one can extract and power is granted to those who manipulate the rules most effectively, corruption is not a side effect. It is the engine. The removal of oversight and the gutting of protective agencies is not an accident or a flaw. It is a feature. Those in power are not failing to govern. They are succeeding at something else entirely. They are using the tools of government to enrich themselves and protect their allies. The result is not chaos. It is extraction disguised as leadership.  What people are witnessing is not a sudden moral collapse. It is a natural process that unfolds when public institutions are slowly converted into private assets. The courts, the agencies, the watchdogs were never built to withstand this kind of pressure. They were always vulnerable to capture. Once the people who benefit from fraud and influence are the same people who make the rules, there is no need to hide anything. The grift becomes official policy. Regulation becomes a weapon used only to protect friends and punish enemies. Trust collapses not because people are cynical but because they are paying attention.  This was never just about one man or one moment. It is a structure that allows those at the top to rewrite the rules in real time. People now live under a government that is stripping itself for parts and selling them off. It will not stop on its own.",mackinnon4congress,2025-05-07T13:26:35,9
