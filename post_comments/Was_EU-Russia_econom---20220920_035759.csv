"I heard this from a European expert but can't find the article so take my word with a grain of salt.  Western Europe post-war, after some time passed, had a mindset that the lesson of WWII is they need to integrate. Both wars were started because nations believed in their individual supremacy and felt that entitled them to conquest. And so while there was certainly an economic component to things like the EEC and EU, a lot of the language used by people pushing it was that this would be the way to ensure none of our nations get in their head they should start another war. That the consequence for another war could be 1 in every 3 young people dead or disabled as had happened twice already. This was the pan-european ethos that began building up in the latter half of the cold war, a belief that war can be avoided with interconnectedness and believing in something larger than your individual nation.   At the end of the cold war, those pan-European institutions began expanding eastward. They seemed to generally share these values and so nothing was openly challenging Western Europe's assumptions about the lessons from WWII.   So the natural order would be continued integration with all of Europe, including Russia. After all, Europe made complex things Russians would buy in droves, and Russia had vast raw resources greater than anything Western Europe had within their borders. More than half of all Russian imports came from Europe and more than half of all Russian exports went to Europe. So, thinking this was just an expansion of cooperation and integration, many nations developed with an assumption that they could always count on those raw resources from Russia.  But 2014 changed that calculus. They invaded, occupied and declared soverignty over Crimea and had a years long war in Eastern Ukraine. It changed some nations views regarding Russia, and many slowly started becoming less dependent on Russia. But the steak through the heart of the idea of peacefull integration of Russia came in Febuary.  Because that story of WWII that western Europe has is not the perspective Russia has on the Great Patriotic War. It wasn't a tale of nations believing conquest was justified. Russia started the war on the side of the Nazis, expanding eastward for the baltic states and part of Poland. But Russian history doesn't consider that part of the Great Patriotic War. That war didn't start until Germany betrayed Russia and attempted to invade. It wasn't a lesson about the folly of expansion, after all they got to keep what they expanded into. It was just a tail about Western Europe being threatened by Russian might. And so the solution is not a universal disarmament and cooperation, it's to say that Russia's authority shall not be challenged.   So Western Europe thought integration with Russia *was* part of their security. And what they're realizing now is they aren't as similar as they thought they were.",auandi,2022-09-20T14:03:40,3
"Most of this is my opinion from what I've read, or been taught, it's not a list of facts which I can provide citations for.   I think that the evidence is rather self evident in the founding purposes of the EU.   The whole idea of the EU, originally the European Communities, was to intertwine the economies of Europe so much to make going to war the least attractive option.   Think about if you had two neighbours, neighbour A has a pool, and neighbour B doesn't, but wants one.  ---  In Europe before the EEC.   Neighbour B pulls out property records and discovers that land has been stolen and that half the pool is actually on their land.   B wants their land back and the pool as recompense - so both sides spend tens of thousands in court to try and get/keep what they want.  Eventually the judge orders that the pool be demolished and the original property line be restored.  Neither side got/kept what they wanted and they spent a lot of money in the process, so now they both need to sell their homes anyway because they need to cover the debt.   ---  Meanwhile Post-EEC/EU.  Neighbour A tells B that they built it as a communal pool and everyone can use it, even neighbours C and D, all A asks B to do is pay 20 Euro a month to help pay for the upkeep of the pool.  And they all live happily ever after.  ---  A lot of the Russian Gas and Oil coming into Europe has been doing so since Russia was still the Soviet Union. The pipelines going through Ukraine to Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary, existed when it was the Ukrainian SSR and long before any of those countries considered joining the EU.  Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the aim has been to tie Russia's economy to Europe in the aim that Russian leadership would recognise that they could prosper more together than they could apart.  Which is a sound idea on the face of it.  However, they neglected the possibility that Russia would simply try to cut out the middle man and just take it all for themselves and try to return to the old world order where resources and access weren't gained by negotiation, but by pure Conquest.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-09-20T08:19:16,6
"The short version is that those in the EU who supported this thought it would lead to closer ties and reduce the chances for war -- Russia wouldn't attack its biggest customer.  Plus, the EU got cheaper gas.  This was very deliberate and was debated at the time at least in foreign policy/political science circles.  I suppose the Russians thought the same thing -- the chances for war would be reduced if the EU became dependent on cheap Russian gas.    Then, NATO advanced (peacefully but provocatively given Russian history) all the way around three sides of Russia.  Russia got fed up and invaded Ukraine rather than let Ukraine become a NATO member (just as they said they would do for a decade or more).  Mearsheimer does a great presentation on this on YouTube.   Of course, we'll see how it all shakes out.  Maybe the EU will cave after a cold, destructively expensive winter.  Maybe Russia will finally cave due to economic sanctions and internal political opposition.  Or must maybe the Ukrainians will really make things interesting by rolling up the Russians from the North to South and retaking Crimea.  They sure seem to want to before the EU gets cold feet (pun intended).",phreeeman,2022-09-20T16:47:45,1
"Close economic ties between Russia and West Europe largely came about since the *Neue Ostpolitik* of the Federal Republic of Germany. Chancellor Willy Brandt, advised by Egon Bahr, sought to lessen tensions between West Germany and the Communist Bloc, especially the USSR and GDR, by more or less accepting the political situation as it was by then. Economic ties might help in changing the incentives for states to cooperate. This is not a very strange idea. Recall that European political integration was the goal, but increasing economic cooperation the means as set out by Schuman.   After the dissolution of the USSR the question about what to do to guarantee security in Europe became very relevant. Russian supplies of hydrocarbons to Europe was one way to keep Russia as much economically afloat as possible, while also providing cheap energy to European industry and households.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-09-20T18:27:28,1
"The problem is that going to war is only the least attractive option if you have to keep your citizens relatively happy to retain power, as in a functioning democracy. If the people either don't know what's happening and/or can't do anything to remove bad leaders, it all breaks down.",kamahaoma,2022-09-20T10:23:05,1
"Besides, they - Russia, and some others - don't want to agree with the modern Western view that homosexuals are regular human beings; they have the ""Family Values"" conference, etc. They need that ""conservative"" fake Christianity to crusade according to.

Russia got fed up and invaded Ukraine rather than let Ukraine become a NATO member (just as they said they would do for a decade or more). Mearsheimer does a great presentation on this on YouTube.   This is false.  NATO rejected Ukraine's applications to join NATO and the issue was considered resolved after 2008.  It only came up again after Russia annexed part of Ukraine in 2014.  Mearsheimer, while a respected IR scholar, is not really an expert on the matter and has been criticised for not actually understanding what Russia's actual position has been during the time.",Naliamegod,2022-09-20T19:07:14,2
"I see it like this then. Even if there wasn't specific document that explicitly states that EU-Russia economic interdependence would lessen the risk of a new war between them, we can see that such decision was in line with other contemporary policies like Neue Ostpolitik or Helsinki Accords. This still doesn't answer what aspect was more appealing (cheap energy or secrity concerns), but maybe it's impossible to tell exactly what was the main reason behind this desicion",salkcid,2022-09-22T13:17:30,2
"It was an assumption that Russia would move to Western democratic norms after the collapse of the Soviet Union, however they didn't anticipate such regression.  Then, after seeing it, they thought they could temper such regression and convince Putin and the Russian leadership that prosperity came from cooperation.  Both were nice ideas in principle, and next to nobody doubted them at the time.  However, as we have learned, they were wrong.  Hindsight is 20/20 and now it seems obvious that they should have cottoned on back then.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-09-20T10:48:25,3
Which is a bit rich considering their militant atheism under the Soviet Union.  It seems to me that Putin is learning from the yearning for religion during that period and is basically trying to have Conservative Christian Communism.,NuclearRobotHamster,2022-09-21T05:45:02,1

">what aspect was more appealing (cheap energy or secrity concerns)  I'd say both were important. If post-Soviet Russia was on its way to becoming a 'normal' European country in the early 1990s, there was no reason not to trade, as the free trade mantra was a clear policy priority in the neoliberal ideas of the Washington consensus and the continuous expansion of the European markets since the Maastricht Treaty. Cheap energy was also the way the sick man of Europe (Germany) could kickstart new growth and become the motor of the EU economy again. Economic growth was all the more important when the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 morphed into the Eurocrisis.   Liberalising the energy markets and operating fully in the neoliberal paradigm of free and privatised markets know best, the cheapest provider of gas became the most attractive, so reliance on Russian hydrocarbons just kept growing. And no politician wants to say that their constituents should pay more for their energy for no reason if there is a cheap provider on the market.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-09-22T17:54:41,1
"*Faulty Powers: Who Started the Ukraine Crisis?* by Michael McFaul and Stephen Sestanovich is a direct response to Measheimer.  [This article](https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/what-putin-fears-most/) by the Journal of Democracy also does a good job at explaining that Russia-NATO relations before 2014 wasn't always hostile, and that even as late as 2010 the two sides were cooperating on numerous issues.",Naliamegod,2022-10-04T20:36:45,2

"Interesting read.  Makes a strong case that there were mixed signals from Russia.   Putin in 2008 said, after NATO welcomed Ukraine and Georgia's application for NATO membership, that he considered Ukraine and Georgia NATO membership to be a ""direct threat"" to Russia.  Doesn't get much clearer than that, and even the article you cite argues only that NATO expansion hasn't been a ""constant"" source of tension, only a variable source of tension.  So, I may have oversimplified and overstated my proposition, but I think you go a bit beyond the article in saying it proves that NATO expansion had been ""resolved"" in 2008.  My claim can be debated, but is not disproven by your article.  Of course, unless someone can read Putin's mind, no one will ever know for sure.  Another interesting discussion here, including on the claim that Putin was motivated by fear of democracy:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2H5ZB1ZDc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL2H5ZB1ZDc)",phreeeman,2022-10-05T16:00:47,2
