Nope. People on both sides. Only thing the political elites on both sides agree on is protecting themselves.,Sd022pe,2025-05-06T19:48:39,249

I don’t think you’ll ever see the Epstein files. He ran in very high and very broad circles. I suspect that a release of  a “list” would ultimately include many innocent along with the guilty.,gouf78,2025-05-06T16:45:34,124
There are no existing incriminating “Epstein files” and it’s damaging for Bondi and Kash Patel to have hyped them up as much as they did. I’m not being hyperbolic in saying that most comments I see on Bondi’s social media just harass her for not releasing the files.   Those files may have existed 6-7 years ago but there’s no chance any incriminating info was left out there.  EDIT: Ok so she came out this morning claiming there are “tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children and CP that the FBI is working diligently to release”. I truly doubt this but sure whatever you say.,LS100,2025-05-06T20:03:44,50
No shot.  Epstein files most likely implicate one of our closest allies in the Middle East.   Qatar.    /s,Best-Guava1285,2025-05-06T17:58:16,35

"I don't know, but what are we really going to learn? That there's a connection between rich, famous and powerful people and gross sex stuff?

"There are no ""Epstein Files."" People imagine he kept a book with a bunch of pages like ""And then on February 4th, 2009 Joe Blow had sex with this 14 year old girl.""

"Pretty much, just like today's news conference, she praised the organisations that did the work, but yet while others can do their jobs, she can't pick up a file that has been on her desk from day one. We see all the accusations of so much government corruption, theft, fraud, but not even one arrest not to mention prosecution.

"Backwards. Maybe I am misunderstanding your sentiment, but I see this rhetoric as having conviction. If someone from the right or the left is demanding the files, both anticipate that both people they do not support, and people who they do support politically will be incriminated.   It’s as simple as clearing the air. We want accountability. That means accountability even if it’s your own grandmother stealing a bottle of shampoo at the grocery store. Eye for an eye.

"> Side conversation — what is your view on our current political climate as a Canadian? Views considering Trump’s stance on Canada becoming 51st?  Covered in a comment from a few days ago (go to my profile and search ""blame Trump""). But the ""51st state"" comment never meant much to me personally, and initially I viewed it as a playful jab to start getting Canadians to think about the beaurocratic/globalist stranglehold going on in our own country. Shame that a sizable chunk of people (mostly dumb and selfish Boomers) fell for Mark Carney saying ""I will protect you from the big bad America trying to get you!"" in response to Trump's comments -- I pray most Canadians aren't dumb enough for them to use that as a smokescreen to implement Globalist policies.  >Maybe I am misunderstanding your sentiment, but I see this rhetoric as having conviction.   I'm not saying the Epstein files aren't important, but at this point everyone already knows we all want the files, and that we all are craving some convictions. But it's done so incessantly that it just feels like noise at this point, and it distracts/trains us to think that saying ""Where Epstein?!?!"" will make any real difference. It's no different from a Lefty putting a Ukrainian flag in their bio, and saying ""it's important because it shows our conviction towards a righteous cause"".  ___  Anyway, if it helps, Jones had some people on talking about the Epstein files a while ago. Apparently after the FBI raided, well, the FBI in Southern New York, a whole bunch of floodgates got opened up, and many terabytes of files and other material had become available for FBI field offices around the country to volunteer to comb through it all (one FBI dude that was interviewed also said he was Epstein material accidentally shared via a Shared Drive folder, which goes to show how widely circulating it is internally).  That's pretty much Order 66 if you ask me, because historically Epstein matters would 100% of the time CONVENIENTLY go to Jamies Comie or his daughter Morine Comey, and it'd just get silently punted without anyone knowing about. James ""Dig In And Resist"" Comie's since been given the boot, and there's been lots of pressure on Morine Comie punting Epstein shit, so it leans towards something been done this time, instead of just being silo'd at a high level and then forgotten.  So there's that, at least. I hope the gubmint ain't yanking our chains again, but I'd like to believe that it will at least take a while to go through, because there's many terabytes of utterly horrifying and physchologically-scarring shit in there, and it's being worked on in a volunteer-only basis due to its terrible nature.",NoTime_SwordIsEnough,2025-05-07T02:48:58,1
"Man, the 51st state stuff is just trolling to the nth level. Nobody with 2 brain cells to rub together believes in that shit.   If anything, the people pushing for it to happen should be smooth brained leftards like AOC and Newsom, because that's literally their best chance of getting elected.

Then why would she say they're on her desk and not release them? You think she's just gonna tease that and then leave them sitting there and do nothing for months?,cossbobo,2025-05-06T16:56:49,-28
