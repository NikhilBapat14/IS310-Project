You want to know when things are about to get really bad? Talk to a trucker (who isn't in the cult) - they see it first,gradientz,2025-04-25T18:02:02,24
they don't sound thankful for the gift of trumponomics,ponyflip,2025-04-25T18:02:35,23
Maybe they should protest with a caravan,Closet-PowPow,2025-04-25T18:04:09,17

Good. Most of them probably voted for Trump... sorry to the ones who didn't. ,StrangerFew2424,2025-04-25T18:52:44,8
">""Right now, we are looking at some change. Something is changing. Maybe it'll be good for us drivers,"" truck driver Jordy Camelo said.  Yeah, no chance of that, Jordy....nothing good will come out of this, this is all just a waste of time.",TheCommonGround1,2025-04-25T20:00:57,6
They should make a big train with their trucks and drive across the country protesting about it.,Luke_Cocksucker,2025-04-26T03:52:16,5
Wonder what percentage voted for Chump,Visual_Dependent5468,2025-04-25T21:43:24,3
"Truck drivers are one of the backbones of commerce in this country.  It would be very dangerous to lose any aspect of that infrastructure.  They are worth listening to, and they aren’t a monolith, politically.  Same with farmers.  They aren’t all right wing nut jobs.  Trump’s economic “strategy” is likely to be damaging to them too, and they are not all a bunch of morons.  So don’t go full schadenfreude on those groups.  This country needs them and they are worth listening to.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T19:02:09,8

Layoffs will be for as long as China says FU to Trump’s foolishness.,yorapissa,2025-04-26T19:07:50,2

They should ask some Canadian drivers lulz,DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-04-25T19:15:23,1
We probably won't be able to make a vote that gets countedin the future.,toxic_badgers,2025-04-25T18:37:41,9
"Hey now, I’m a trucker and sure as hell never voted for this imbecile. I also just deliver for a local factory so I’m not affected by the shortages….yet. Most likely I’m about to lose any leverage for an increase in pay as more and more experienced truckers become available and desperate. I hate all of this.",curlyfat,2025-04-26T19:40:39,2
"Yep, truckers and strippers are often good barometers on the economy on opposite sides of the economy. Truckers see the volume of products and strippers see just disposable income.",ianrl337,2025-04-25T18:19:32,17
The Venn diagram of truckers and people who didn't vote for trump are two entirely different circles,im_a_squishy_ai,2025-04-25T18:14:15,10
Yes if your goal is to spend more time with your family and less time making money.,jayhasbigvballs,2025-04-26T10:51:13,3
"My apologies for contradicting you, but they are willfully morons. They will cut off their nose to spite their face, and face the pain with pride since they think that ""eventually"" their fantasy will come true. Yes, they recognize the immediate pain. But they gloss over it with idiotic rhetoric. I've been a truck driver for over 6 years, and I hear it all the damn time. And when they lose their trucks/contracts, they blame the Mexicans and queers, just as they've been brainwashed to do.",AEternal1,2025-04-26T09:21:47,5
Thats why we cannot afford to be complacent.,[deleted],2025-04-25T18:44:59,3
If that’s the case we have a much greater responsibility than voting to take care of.,SellaraAB,2025-04-25T19:02:42,3
there's def more than a few truckers who arent trump supporters but they're mad rare for sure,Own-Review-2295,2025-04-25T18:15:43,13
"Everyone is waiting for the one event thats so outragous that something snaps and resets... but nothings snapping. ICE is raiding houses without warrants, judges are being arrested and somehow we havent collectively went and ripped these people from their high castles.",toxic_badgers,2025-04-25T18:49:21,14

"Rare enough that I've never met one, despite working truck gates for the past 6 years.   At least not one that would admit to not supporting him at any rate.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-25T18:21:06,10
"   [here's one that runs a youtube channel](https://youtu.be/yJw9syxlXhI?si=8ksyKTRQx_Y5rA27)  my buddy is a truck driver based in NM and has a big ol' sickle and hammer tattooed on his face. got another buddy based out of FL who isn't a hardline socialist like the NM dude but he's still staunchly anti-trump. They're out there. They're definitely rare though, i agree with you on that. And with you being in the profession for 6 years, i bet you've met more non-trump supporters than you think (respectfully)   i say all this not to argue but to help you feel a little better. We have a lot more blue-collar support over on the anti-trump side than we realize. It may not feel like it, especially for someone like you in your profession or for me here in rural IL. So. Keep your head up.",Own-Review-2295,2025-04-25T19:41:52,8
"My husband is one. They're out there. They're rare, but they're there.",ReginaldDwight,2025-04-25T22:12:21,6
Most of us that aren’t in that cult are smart enough to not haul general freight and have secured more stable contracts in specialized areas of the industry. We’re out here and it’s not going to be good. The warning signs are showing already.,slayerofthefluff,2025-04-26T01:44:28,1
