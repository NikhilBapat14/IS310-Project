"This is exactly why I *was* a Democrat. I believe in fiscal responsibility, which in my lifetime only the Democrats ever have shown, and I believe is social freedom, which Democrats want for all people and Republicans want only for themselves.  I am a Democrat *now* because it's the party that still believes in the Constitution. The Democrats are fighting to preserve our Constitutional Republic as the Repubs are erasing Constitutional Amendments with executive orders.",MrYdobon,2025-04-27T08:42:33,419

"It's great that there are subtle movements of people away from the current Republican party. But this guy still seems to believe things that have not been true for a long time.  Republicans have not believed in fiscal sanity or financial responsibility for as long as I have been alive. They consistenly make the national debt worse, they reduce our government funding, and they spend money on unnecessary military and law enforcement efforts that would be better spent on better diplomacy and social services.  I was a Republican, and I believed all of the things that he believed. But, after being educated, I learned that those things were not true. Breaking away from the party is great. Kudos for that. But, we are never going to get past this partisan bullshit if people don't break away from ""alternative facts.""",rogue203,2025-04-27T08:28:04,22

I switched parties in 2012 and voted for Obama after having voted for republicans since 1992.  I guess it took me twenty years to figure out that trickle was another word for dribble and that both of those terms meant that  the poor and middle class were getting shafted.  That was during the same time that I went back to college and got my Bachelor‚Äôs degree and started viewing the world differently.    As a republican I thought I had to accept all the ugly parts of conservatism as well but personal growth with bouts of emotional maturity eroded decades of racism and homophobia.  My eyes opened to ignorance and I started to develop a new sense of who I wanted to be.    Instead of judging gays I started taking queer theory courses so I could better understand them.  Instead of judging homeless people I started working soup kitchens.  I worked in the Native American community in my spare time while in college and even had a Capstone course on Native American environmentalism.    I honestly believe today that we have the winning platform.  I wear the term liberal with gratitude.  I‚Äôm a liberal because I care about other people besides myself.  I‚Äôm a white male and I‚Äôm educated now.  I understand why Civil Rights Act is important.  If we‚Äôre not all eating at the same table then we have work to do because either we all have the same value as human beings or none of us do.   We are for human rights.  These are the fundamental rights granted us in our constitution and the rights bestowed on us through Congress and the courts in the past 250 years.   We are for workers rights.  These are rights and benefits chiefly granted us through legislation and organized labor and a lot of those rights we have today were created out of necessity due to human suffering and tragedy.    We‚Äôre for equality because we have the humility and compassion to understand our own history.   We‚Äôre for the environment because this planet is our only home and it belongs to future residents just as much as it belongs to us.,Christ_on_a_Crakker,2025-04-27T11:14:40,51
