"“While there are still pride events and the ""Tapestry of Pride"" is still a go, the Kennedy Center is no longer hosting anything of the sort.  Add to this all of the other non-Pride but still woke acts that are self-canceling from the venue.”  And the winning continues!!",dottedoctet,2025-04-28T07:19:09,17
">'There would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,' he said. 'Otherwise it is a hostile performance space.'

"He’s conservative that’s the problem for them. If they’re not being pandered too, then it’s not inclusive. You can’t just treat people like people you know.",jacksonexl,2025-04-28T09:05:22,12
">If they’re not being pandered too, then it’s not inclusive.  I think you're right.
