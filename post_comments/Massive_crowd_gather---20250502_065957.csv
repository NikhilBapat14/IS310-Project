"Food for thought for you both, but setting aside the potential disruption of emergency services involved with blocking traffic (which is a big one), it isn’t as simple as people prioritizing their “convenience” over being oppressed.  As you’re likely well aware of, there are tens if not hundreds of millions of people out there shackled to the indentured servitude system of healthcare that we have in this country, where coverage is tied to employment. There are likely many people, if not the majority, that are also in agreement with you on the importance in standing against the same things you are, but being late for their jobs could mean losing employment and potentially lifesaving meds or healthcare for themselves or their families.  So no, the point is not to “disrupt people’s lives” simply because it is important, especially when none of those people are involved or have any way of bringing the changes you want.

You made a point of how my post could be misconstrued. I understand that, im not the most elegant and getting my thoughts out of my head into a physical format. Honestly, i'm probably have undiagnosed autism, but that is neither here nor there. The way you worded things tells me you sort of understood where i was trying to go. In my head at least, the mere fact that this is even a discussion just shows how the focus is so easily shifted from the important thing to the actual action. No one is ever going to be like thank god those people blocked traffic and caused change. Where with the lunch counter example the action is associated with the cause very clearly. Does any of this make sense, probably only in my head. But still thank you for actual thoughtful discussion. People need to take notice of this.

A protest is an intentional disruption of a system, which is in opposition to complacency. Clearly protestors aren’t putting themselves in harms way for fun: they are there for a cause.

"So brave of you to chime in with the downvoters without actually telling me what you think I’m wrong about. The reality is that yes there is value in disrupting the normal flow and cadence of the country to get things heard and acted on, but it’s also true that intentionally blocking traffic will come with outside costs and risks to people both uninvolved and ultimately unable to do anything to enact the changes you want and that they may themselves agree with. You and the others here seem to have accepted that cost, despite the existence of alternative protesting methods that don’t have those costs and risks while generating the same affect. So be it.  This is one of those issues that people like to stand strong on in a vacuum or hypothetical, until it comes to affect them personally. Everyone loves the idea of shutting the country down to finally be heard about their specific most pressing issue, until suddenly it’s them personally stuck in traffic behind one of these stunts with a child having an allergic reaction and needing immediate medical attention.   I’m fine with the general disagreement, but my point still stands, and it’ll at least get people thinking about ways to accomplish their goals of protesting while being considerate of harm they might cause to others.
