"Definitely targeted.  Let's face it - there certainly is waste in government. But most of it IMHO comes from the way Congress passes bills. In order to get enough votes to pass a measure, there's always pork barrel that goes to the districts of various representatives and senators as a quid pro quo to get their votes.  Not only do both parties do this, but *we the people want it as well*. Come election time we - all of us - will want to know what our elected official has done for us. If our representative or senator is up for election and says ""I shut down the government facility in my district putting people out of work but it cut the deficit"", he or she would not get elected.  Anyway, DOGE isn't going after these pork barrel projects, but rather against things Musk thinks - with no evidence - would be run more efficiently by private enterprise. Also, it feels like things in prosperous blue states are being targeted.",formerrepub,2025-04-04T18:03:26,127
"As others have already pointed out most of the US budget goes to Medicare, Medicaid, social security, and the military. What has DOGE cut? They've gone after USAid and the CFPB. USAid is about financial aid to other countries like providing AIDES treatment in Africa. The CFPB doesn't make laws, it enforces existing ones. Furthermore it gets it's budget from the Federal Reserve and has returned Billions of dollars to consumers. Neither of these agencies actually cost that much but both are an anathema to the Republican party.",MartialBob,2025-04-04T19:52:49,24
"The thing that I see as a federal worker and understand as someone with a background in public policy is that a lot of the ""waste"" is by design. An enormous amount of the much-derided red tape and litigious specificity comes from congress, and especially the conservative end of the aisle, demanding more and more and more checks and hoops to access programs or verify that they're doing what they're supposed to do. That's not bad in and of itself, but it is darkly hilarious how much bloat comes from shit like work requirements that in effect cost a shit ton of money and are ultimately counterproductive.  Beyond that, there is no intellectually honest way to argue that this isn't targeted at harming the enemies of ideological conservatism. The places DOGE has cut, and the ways they have gone about it, are fundamentally guided by a willful misunderstanding of government and how the public sector works. You can treat the government like Twitter all you want, but that won't make your ""reforms"" work.  If DOGE were actually out to cut waste, they would have started by cutting themselves and ended it there.",TheSlyNewt,2025-04-04T20:58:01,12

"If you think the government is bloated, what you should do is study each department and determine whether or not they are performing functions that are not essential. At the same time, you should be reviewing the workforce in the department and determining which employees are not up to snuff. Then, you could eliminate the non-essential functions and get rid of the number of employees performing that function out of the pool of employees who are deadwood. So if you discover the Department of Health and Human Services is conducting underwater basket weaving classes and has 100 employees performing and supporting that function, you should require that they stop performing that function and also that they get rid of 100 employees. But the crucial thing is this: you should get rid of 100 low performing people across the entire department, not necessarily the hundred employees performing that function.  DOGE isn’t doing any of that. It’s pretty obvious that they are just getting rid of functions that Elon doesn’t approve of, and they’re deleting all of the employees that perform that function without regard to how good they are. What Elon is doing then is an abomination. He’s not doing anything about bloat, so he’s lost the opportunity to do so.",Dr_CleanBones,2025-04-05T10:05:26,6

"You would be surprised that a whole lot of Republicans actually do care about things like Medicaid and SNAP, especially if the economy crashes, but it's viewed as a partisan attack because the Republican party looks down on the poor despite their people making up a ton of their constituents.  They're using it in as partisan a way as they can, and they assume everyone in the government is basically partisan, but they're also just haphazard with it and don't know what they're doing.  Ultimately it'll probably cost us money to undo the damage they do.

"Well here’s kinda the thing  * ~40% of the federal budget is entitlements (excluding social security, since is funding is separate) * ~15% of the federal budget is redistribution to existing state programs to augment them (education, etc) * ~5% is the administrative overhead of those two things.  So *right off the bat* 60% of the budget is liberal ideas.  Okay, of the rest: * 15% is national defense * 15% is interest on the national debt * 3% is national infrastructure (faa, etc) * 3% science & energy  * 3% is the entirety of the judiciary and law enforcement  * 1% is foreign aid + misc  Okay so, unfortunately we can’t debate interest in national debt. That’s cumulative penalty for the unbalanced budget and why we’re having this conversation to begin with.  Defense, national infra, and like the basic law admin & judiciary is the 20% of the budget that *is* the federal government itself.   So all you can do is trim foreign aid, non critical (fluffy) science, and entitlements - but all that together is *by far* the biggest part of the budget.  Liberals do like to constantly bemoan the defense budget - but it’s at near historic lows relative to GDP and kinda essential unless Europe contributes more.  Most of the the “waste” in military is in procurement of military hardware that seems silly given lower tech adversaries, but that money is both (1) the most direct scientific funding in the government that gave us the internet / gps / space (2) generally focused on higher precision to reduce civilian damage or staying ahead of China technologically.  There’s fat to be trimmed in the military like everywhere else, but line it’s a lot less than you’d expect. A rather lot of the military budget is in personnel - and soldiers make very little money.  DOGE cannot unilaterally decide the biggest costs - which basically require reviewing Medicare coverage & eligibility - without Congress.  It’s limited to cutting money that Congress didn’t specifically allocate. If the law says “give X dollars to each person that qualifies for SNAP under criteria Y” - DoGE can’t modify it.  But if Congress says “executive branch, you have up to X dollars to spend on problem Y” without specificity, then DOGE cans say “cool - we don’t need to spend X, we can spend less”.  So DOGE might not be able to solve the biggest problems - but what it can do is find lots of little waste and shift the culture.",Kman17,2025-04-04T19:00:54,-4

You should check out [https://usafacts.org](https://usafacts.org) to learn more about [Federal Spending](https://usafacts.org/government-spending/) and where it goes before trying to power hit that fastball.  Federal spending, without regard to what it is being spent on is designed to create the maximum amount of economic activity in the most congressional districts that could possibly contribute labor to fulfill the need.  Hence the military is one of the largest high ego jobs programs (make work) that ever existed.  Even after base closures, military spending is widely distributed through troops, arms manufacturers, consumables, etc.  The VA is part of the military budget and has facilties in every state. These programs have two missions 1) Spend money so stragglers are employed.  2) Actually do the thing we are paying to be done.    Your liberal 'entitlements' include the farm bill which is a very Republican benefitting spending bill since it buys crops from \[Republicans\] at fixed prices and gives it to anyone who can convince their state that they need food \[Republicans/Independents/Democrats\]. Everybody eats.    DOGE isn't dealing with any of this according to any plan.

Government spending invariably cycles back into the real economy, and ending government debt pushes that precise debt onto regular civilians.  The idea that the federal government has become significantly more bloated over time is meanwhile not supported by the numbers. When we look at the percentage of the U.S. population working for the federal government (excluding military), the numbers show almost no change over 60 years:  2024: 0.72%  1960: 0.70%  And if federal payroll were truly a massive budget burden, cutting it should have a significant impact. So, what portion of the federal budget is actually devoted to payroll (excluding military)?  2024: 4.25%  This means that if we eliminated every single civilian government job tomorrow (excluding military), we would save only 4% of the federal budget. That’s far from a silver bullet for reducing debt.  If we were paying significantly more for federal employees today than in the past, we’d expect the payroll burden to be higher. But when we compare the percentage of the federal budget devoted to payroll:  1960: 11.9%  2024: 4.25%  That’s a 64.3% reduction since 1960.  Comparing payroll costs to the size of the U.S. economy gives a clearer picture:  1960: 2.03% of GDP  2024: 1.02% of GDP  That’s a 49.8% reduction in federal payroll as a share of GDP.

Certianly not in the United States federal budget.  >  The top marginal tax rate in 1970 was something like 72%; This enabled and sustained a robust middle class with a corresponding spending power that kept capital in circulation and not pooling in some offshore tax haven, or laundered through real estate holdings, yachts, art and luxury goods.  This ""robust middle class"" was an anomaly, not a standard.  At least in the United States, the middle class is shrinking now, yes, because there are more people moving into the upper class.  That's a *good thing*.  > Last Year Elon Musk paid just 3% tax on his personal income and Tesla payed $0 in tax while the average American owes something like 24% their yearly income to the government   Okay, and what?  Sounds to me that Elon Musk paid a lot more in taxes than he should have, and since the corporate rate should be zero...",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-06T12:37:59,0

"   Citizen's United decided Money=Speech and so buying politicians is now protected by the 1st amendment.     >""Why does this (the rise in wealth disparity) matter?""... What austerity?""   Ignoring your complete lack of irony in juxtaposing these two questions; Austerity,  manifesting as - stagnant wages, inflated housing costs, lack of investment in public infrastructure or healthcare,  price gouging by drug and insurance companies, the destruction of the public education system, the selling off of public lands etc. etc. -- all matters because society suffers as a consequence of letting money pool in obscene sums around a relative handful of individuals.  >the middle class is shrinking now, yes, because there are more people moving into the upper class. That's a *good thing*.     This is kind of bullshit or creative spin on a statistic dispelled by the fact that an average worker could afford a home start a family on median yearly salary in the mid 70s and now people are forgoing kids, are trapped paying inflated rents while their student loans haunt them for decades; who are absolutely controlled and subjugated by debt.  [People born in 1980 are way less likely to earn more than their parents did by age 30, as their parents were less likely to earn as much as their own boomer parents. ](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2020/09/social-mobility-upwards-decline-usa-us-america-economics/)  If there are more affluent people now there are still way more people who's disposable income has been stripped and are now hovering around the poverty line or below.        > Sounds to me that Elon Musk paid a lot more in taxes than he should have  Why should the worlds richest man pay only 3% of his personal income in tax while someone making under 6 figure a year is disqualified from similar tax loopholes and must pay closer to 24%? - Seriously? Who in good faith can advocate for that?  His obscene wealth is emblematic of [a broken economic system](https://inequality.org/article/billionaires-sign-econ-failure/) not least because that wealth as been syphoned out society; but also as mentioned, the Citizen United decision gives now allows that wealth to distort or completely undermine democracy.",pomod,2025-04-06T14:23:08,1
"> Citizen's United decided Money=Speech and so buying politicians is now protected by the 1st amendment.   This is not true.  What *Citizens United* did was say that electioneering expenditures could not be limited in the way the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act stipulated, aligned with decades of precedent.  > Austerity, manifesting as - stagnant wages, inflated housing costs, lack of investment in public infrastructure or healthcare, price gouging by drug and insurance companies, the destruction of the public education system, the selling off of public lands etc. etc. -- all matters because society suffers as a consequence of letting money pool in obscene sums around a relative handful of individuals.  So is your issue with austerity or with... all of those things, many of which aren't even true?  Austerity means something, and it's not this list.  > This is kind of bullshit or creative spin on a statistic dispelled by the fact that an average worker could afford a home start a family on median yearly salary in the mid 70s and now people are forgoing kids, are trapped paying inflated rents while their student loans haunt them for decades; who are absolutely controlled and subjugated by debt.   Should we pull women out of the workforce, then?  Re-institute racial discrimination to reduce all the demand on housing and push wages back up?  Or is it perhaps that you've been fed a lies about what ""changed"" in the economy?  > Why should the worlds richest man pay only 3% of his personal income in tax while someone making under 6 figure a year is disqualified from similar tax loopholes and must pay closer to 24%?   No one under six figures is paying ""closer to 24%"" unless you're also adding in payroll taxes on Social Security and Medicare and adding in the employer contribution. It's even less if they're married or have a kid.  Your entire perspective is based off of this, and it's incorrect.  > His obscene wealth   What's obscene about it?  Is it obscene because the number is arbitrarily big?  Is it obscene because he's made his billions off of lowering fossil fuel usage and improving efficiency in space technology?  Is it because we dislike the president?  > not least because that wealth as been syphoned out society  Syphoned out?  Is he keeping $300 billion under the mattress?  I thought his wealth was all in stocks and ownership stakes in his companies?   That's... the opposite of syphoned out!  > the Citizen United decision gives now allows that wealth to distort or completely undermine democracy.  How so?
