Democrats are out here citing the Constitution like it‚Äôs a terms-of-service agreement, while MAGA‚Äôs already hacked the platform and rewritten the algorithm. There‚Äôs no leader on the left because no one knows what to do in the face of a democratic collapse.",newellz,2025-05-09T00:46:25,4

I haven't seen that since my 90s=00s alt movie phase. I think I'd appreciate it a bit more now that I'm an adult who's done adult things. I wonder if *Adam and Steve* aged well... I vaguely remember a lot of unnecessary fat jokes.,mai_tai87,2025-05-09T02:47:46,2
