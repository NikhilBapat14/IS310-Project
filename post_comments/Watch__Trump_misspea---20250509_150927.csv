Misspeaks? He's a moron.,Mike_Pences_Mother,2025-05-09T15:13:10,235
"He's been doing this for years - saying the wrong names, ranting about nonsense, getting names wrong, facts wrong, making no sense at all.   And it doesn't have any impact on his support or his popularity.  Because his supporters either don't care because they're getting what they wanted from him; or don't know about it,because the people who are getting what they wanted, make sure the rubes never hear about it.",La-Boheme-1896,2025-05-09T15:15:47,92
"That was a hell of a fuck up. It's one thing to say ""country"" and mean ""corporation,"" it's a whole other thing to make up a whole fake story about a non-existent country threatening to impose countermeasures.   He didn't misspeak. He meant every word because *he has no idea what's going on*.  Can we PLEASE agree that his egg is scrambled and be fucking done already?",Frickin_Brat,2025-05-09T15:20:14,64

"Trump is threatening to tariff individual companies. While that's probably not legal, he could still threaten an industry over one company's decision. He's threatening to destroy sectors of the economy on a whim.   Corporations should cease all donations to Republicans until Trump is removed from office. Trump would be out in a week.",RedLanternScythe,2025-05-09T16:02:03,10

Misspeaks is a word used for people who are usually sound and reasoned. Trump is not either. He is just stupid and doesn’t know how things work.   To say “misspeaks” is to sane wash him and pretend that he is usually sound or reasoned,OldschoolScience,2025-05-09T20:46:00,4

"Whelp he’s a fucking idiot. Though this slip is pretty benign, let’s focus on him not knowing if he needs to defend the constitution despite going through the oath of office twice. Or when he thought asylum seekers were people released from insane asylums(Particularly dangerous because it started a narrative that stuck).",sadetheruiner,2025-05-09T15:40:13,7
Are you sure he didn't see a promo for the Barbie movie and think she came from the land of Mattel?  Someone check and see if he tried to put a tariff on that too.,Za_Lords_Guard,2025-05-09T16:39:45,3

"The media spent ten years covering up Trump’s idiocy and dementia. They would quote a few words then summarize the rest of the blathering into what they wanted to believe he actually meant - or wanted us to believe he meant. It’s only been in the past month that more outlets are posting video clips of entire questions and answers. And damn - when he speaks, he’s a fucking idiot. He has no idea what he’s talking about.  I would pay good money to have a journalist ask “what’s a tariff?” Or “what’s a trade deficit?” He doesn’t fucking know!",wiscopup,2025-05-09T17:55:23,39
