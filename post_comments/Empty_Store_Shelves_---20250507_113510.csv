"So we’re now bracing for shortages coupled with price hikes of existing goods. The dollar keeps depreciating, which ordinarily would lead to an uptick in exports, but other countries are no longer talking to us. Plus, the US brand is toxic in many parts of the world. We’re expected to see an economic downturn that may lead to wide-scale job losses at a time when all aspects of the social safety net are being gutted. Factor in the accelerated adoption of AI by companies now working with tighter budgets, and the economic picture looks even uglier. At the same time, Trump and his associates are engaging in outright corruption by amassing billions from their meme-coin bribery scheme and using their official positions to shake down every business and institution in this country solely for personal profit and pleasure. The political backlash to this better be spectacular, or there’s absolutely no hope for this country.",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-07T12:25:58,94

The plan is to cripple the American economy, lower wages, destroy any semblance of labor rights, raise prices, and ultimately get you to accept a lower standard of living.   Make America “great” again for the ultra wealthy means pre labor-rights movement domination and exploitation of the working class by rich industrialists.   They killed striking people at the turn of the century rather than give them labor rights. They’ll do it to you too once they’ve stripped the constitution down to the studs and you have little to no recourse for their overreach.

"Hate to break it to you but lots of grocery stores and convenience stores , as well as pharmacies and such run on maybe a week or so before replenishment is needed, average according to internet is they plan orders to arrive every 3-6 days. Sure initially some stores may have planned ahead but this depends on cash flow for buying, logistics , supply chain, and labor.   Read an article years ago about one major chain saying they only plan for 2-3 days of stock as they rely on replenishment every few days. Granted the topic was about concern of shortages in an event like our grid goes down which would disrupt logistics and basically grind everything to a halt for who knows how long. No one really thinks about someone intentionally trying to cause shortages like Trump administration is doing ad so the impact of that might be different.  Obviously things like electronics and furniture may sit for months in a store , but actual stuff we need day to day isn’t as well stocked as you might think.  Not trying to scare people or cause alarm, but yeah modern logistics and movement of goods and services coupled with software and running as close to what need vs out of stock has reduced the amount of extra stock grocery stores and such carry.  If you have a co-op or local grocery store that isn’t a big box chain or supermarket, they tend to be able to pivot more quickly and also tend to stock and source goods from local vendors and businesses overall. Big supermarkets and big box stores have massive logistics  abilities but this leaves them more vulnerable to shortages and disruptions in being able to keep shelves stocked than small co-ops or local shops.",SayVandalay,2025-05-07T14:20:02,3

"Like with toilet paper during COVID. The fact that the supply chain was messed up delaying deliveries of everyday consumables led people to buy obscenely unnecessary amounts than they would otherwise on fear of never being able to buy TP when they need it, causing demand to far overextend beyond what the supply chain could keep up with and leading to an extended ""shortage"".  And oddly enough, when the first cases broke out nearby, (as our metro area happened to be one of the first areas in the nation to have cases confirmed) there was another panic rush to the local grocery stores resulting in a shortage of... Milk, bread, eggs, rice, beans, formula, canned foods, instant noodles - on fears that there was going to be a lockdown where nobody would be allowed to travel and needed to have months of supplies to live off of by tomorrow.

"Ha, I'm not vegetarian either but in an effort to get healthier, reduce my cholesterol, etc, I'm meatless four or five days a week and with that time I make a ton of tofu stir frys.    Best way to get a nice crunchy tofu is to cover it in something starchy (I use corn starch) and fry in oil in a very hot wok. However, all that oil often defeats my purpose of eating healthier so I've taken to baking it instead. There are tons of youtube videos on how to do this which is where I learned.   Beyond that, I'll use the wok to stir fry whatever vegetables I want, use whatever store bought sauce I'm using that night and im good to go. The fun thing is that there's no shortage of variations you can do with this. My favorite is still mixing soy, dark soy, a little honey, a little fish sauce, and a little Sriracha. Glad I started doing this a few years ago since meat is getting prohibitively expensive and tofu is still pretty cheap.

"It's simple math. I also love how folks downvote me when I simply state FACTS.      2026 is going to be the worst map for Democrats in decades. They’re defending a bunch of seats in deep red states, while Republicans have almost no vulnerable seats.  Here’s the breakdown:  * Democrats (and independents who caucus with them) are defending **23 seats**, including in **deep red states like Montana, West Virginia, and Ohio**—states Trump won by large margins *twice*. * Republicans are only defending **11 seats**, and most are in solid red states. There are **no obvious pickup opportunities** for Democrats unless there's a political earthquake. * West Virginia is already functionally lost—Manchin isn’t running again, and it’s one of the most pro-Trump states in the country. That's already one flipped seat for Republicans. * Even if Democrats hold *every other seat*, they’d still be **losing ground**, not gaining.  So to *win* the Senate, Democrats would have to:  1. **Hold** every single vulnerable seat (e.g., Montana, Ohio, Arizona, Nevada). 2. **Pick up** at least **two** seats from Republicans, when there are virtually **no winnable targets**.  Statistically speaking, that’s not just unlikely, it’s next to impossible, even *with* Democrats as the opposition party in a midterm. Midterms *usually* favor the party not in the White House, but in 2026, the map is so brutal for Democrats that even that advantage likely won’t matter.",jmcdono362,2025-05-07T13:46:18,-2

"I get where you're coming from, Trump's presidency could absolutely create backlash and mobilize opposition. But even massive public outrage doesn’t change which seats are up in 2026. The problem is geography, not just mood.  The most vulnerable Senate seats are in deep red states like:   West Virginia – Trump won it by nearly 40 points. Manchin’s likely out. Republicans basically already banked this seat.   Montana – Also solidly pro-Trump; Tester is a strong incumbent but still very at risk    Ohio – Trump won it twice. Sherrod Brown is a fighter, but he’s on razor-thin margins.  Democrats aren’t just fighting public sentiment, they’re fighting the basic partisan lean of these states. Even in a 2018-style ""blue wave,"" Dems lost Senate seats in ND, MO, IN, similar kinds of red states.  Meanwhile, Republicans are defending safe seats in places like:   Utah    Mississippi    Nebraska    Texas (maybe ""lean R"" at best)    No obvious pickups here, even in a bad GOP year.  Unless Trump’s regime craters in some never-before-seen way that shifts deep red states into blue territory, which there’s zero polling or precedent for, it won’t be enough to flip the Senate. The House? Maybe. The Senate? Still a structural fortress for the GOP in 2026.  I looked at both Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball ratings for each 2026 Senate race. Here's where things will end up based on their ratings.  Republicans: All 23 Republican-held seats up for election are projected to be retained, maintaining their total at 53 seats.  Democrats: All 12 Democratic-held seats up for election are projected to be retained, maintaining their total at 45 seats.  Independents: The two Independent senators, who caucus with the Democrats, are not up for re-election and thus retain their seats.  No net change in the balance of power in the Senate, with Republicans maintaining a majority.",jmcdono362,2025-05-07T14:58:14,2
"Where am I talking about the 2024 election?      I laid out the Senate math for 2026, and that math is backed by reality and reporting, including Politico.  “Senate Democrats’ already difficult 2026 map just got even worse.”   Politico, March 12, 2025  Democrats are defending tough seats in red states like Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, and they're now losing seats in traditionally blue states too, like New Hampshire, Michigan, and Minnesota due to retirements:  “Then Sen. Jeanne Shaheen piled on... forcing the Democrats to defend a third Senate seat in 2026, in addition to retiring Sens. Gary Peters and Tina Smith.”  And even Democrats admit how dire the situation is:  “It’s no secret that we face a tough map,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.)  ""The map is better in ‘26 than ‘24. It’s not as good in ‘26 as it will be in ‘28.”, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)  There are at most two real GOP targets (Maine and North Carolina), and flipping both still wouldn't deliver a majority if Democrats lose even a single vulnerable seat. Politico calls 2026 a “stepping stone to their actual shot... in 2028.”  So yes, the numbers and even the Democratic leadership agree: winning back the Senate in 2026 is statistically next to impossible.",jmcdono362,2025-05-07T14:31:42,1

"There are no Democratic senators in Ohio, Montana, or West Virginia right now. This is easily verifiable information and I don’t know why it’s included in both of your posts.",Jyarados,2025-05-07T17:54:43,1
"Fair point, bringing up West Virginia, Montana, and Ohio muddled the timeline. Those were part of the 2024 cycle and are already factored into the current GOP majority.  But the core issue still stands: 2026 is a brutal map for Democrats. They're on defense in multiple traditionally blue states due to retirements, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Minnesota, while Republicans have very few competitive seats to defend.  Even Democrats are calling it a ""stepping stone"" year, not a realistic shot to flip the chamber. As Politico reports:  “Democrats’ biggest challenge was always going to be a limited number of pick-up opportunities... winning both \[Maine and North Carolina\] wouldn’t win back control of the Senate on their own ,  and neither are slam dunks.”  So yeah, the math is still bleak. 2026 remains a defensive cycle for Democrats with almost no offensive upside.",jmcdono362,2025-05-07T18:55:09,1
"You're absolutely right, those seats flipped in 2024, and Democrats no longer hold them.  So I will redirect to 2026, where the map is still extremely difficult for Democrats. They now have to defend open seats in Michigan, Minnesota, and New Hampshire, all of which are competitive due to retirements, and they have very few realistic pickup opportunities. Maine and North Carolina are long shots, and even flipping both wouldn’t guarantee a majority.  So while the specific states I mentioned were outdated, the bigger picture hasn't changed: 2026 remains a near-impossible path back to the Senate majority for Democrats.",jmcdono362,2025-05-07T18:57:24,2
