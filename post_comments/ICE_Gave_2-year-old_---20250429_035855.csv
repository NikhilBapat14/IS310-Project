"Did they feel it? The thrill of power that comes with doing evil?  Like this scene, these agents of our own government hunger to exercise arbitrary power and petty evil. Perhaps the excitement of pressuring children and parents to make inhuman choices and to betray their own and themselves is unlike the euphoria of any drug or any conventional pleasure.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ9bht5H2p4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ9bht5H2p4)  And a REAL Sophie's Choice played out in 2019:  ""At a Border Patrol holding facility in El Paso, Texas, an agent told a Honduran family that one parent would be sent to Mexico while the other parent and their three children could stay in the United States, according to the family. The agent turned to the couple's youngest daughter — 3-year-old Sofia, whom they call Sofi — and asked her to make a choice.  ""The agent asked her who she wanted to go with, mom or dad,"" her mother, Tania, told NPR through an interpreter. ""And the girl, because she is more attached to me, she said mom. But when they started to take \[my husband\] away, the girl started to cry. The officer said, 'You said \[you want to go\] with mom.'""

The CIA promoted prosperity gospel evangelism throughout the US and Latin America in order to combat what they saw as the socialist ideologies of the Catholic Church. You can argue the Catholic Church isn’t any better than the rest ,and you would be right, but Jesus cared more about the sins of the rich against the poor than he did about sexual sin. Also never mentions homosexuality or abortion…just saying.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-29T10:26:31,8

"Yes the Bible does give instructions in Numbers but that wasnt Jesus. A link I’m not sure I have, reading up on the John birch society and Phylis schlafly, the Banzer plan was an operation in Bolivia that was funded to fight against liberation theology and progressive clergy. St. Oscar Romero  and St. Stanley Rother were both killed by cia funded far right contras. There was a report written by the Brazilian catholic bishop association spelling out the claims as well. behind the bastards podcast has a few episodes on this, but mostly I know this from books and zines and people I’ve met who were in the region in the 70’s.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-29T12:16:09,3
"Again I said Jesus not the Bible . If you’re asking me personally, Paul was specifically speaking to the church of Corinth (Greece) so it’s a specific cultural and historic moment in church history. I also don’t accept a single utterance of Saul of Tarsus, mans was a grifter.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-29T17:53:31,2
Where does what you think you know about Jesus come from?    Even Romans 1:26-27 was addressed to the Greeks?    Why would Jesus be more credible than someone (Paul) who claimed to be his apostle and preached in his name?,nicoppolis,2025-04-29T18:04:45,0
"I don’t “know” anything about Jesus, I’m not an authority and I shouldn’t be expected to defend my stance as one but I’ve spent my entire life in the church and have committed much of my teens and younger years to the Catholic worker movement. I was raised in Latin American churches and see the faith through the praxis I was part of. Saul of Tarus never met Jesus and claimed himself to be an apostle, while Mark Peter John and James acknowledged his ministry there is clearly a dividing line between the teachings uttered by Christ and what Paul claimed and became cannon. Out and out I don’t like Paul’s ideas and I don’t really accept his authority. I believe the four canonical gospels are where the real meat of the faith lies.  Edit: I wrote Mark here that was a mistake. Leaving it in because mistakes happen.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-29T18:23:10,2
"Supposing that Mark and John, the two supposed authors of the eponymous gospels, had personally known Jesus (let's say so), what about Matthew? And Luke, whom you ""forgot"" to mention?  Is Mark's name mentioned among the apostles?    Why, if the first two actually knew Jesus, did it take them several decades to write down their respective ""testimonies""?",nicoppolis,2025-04-30T09:36:56,0
"There is no mention of Paul and Matthew ever exchanging letters or meeting, some believe Mark (John Mark) , Luke and Paul worked together others don’t. I didn’t “forget” I just didn’t mention, again I didn’t know I was defending my thesis to some random.  Mark (John Mark) was a known follower of Peter and a scribe and a well known Christian from early on. Marks gospel is alleged to be the accounts of Peter told to him by Peter.   I don’t know why it took decades but we’re talking about a spiritual rebel group (Jesus and followers) that spun off from another messianic group (John the Baptist and followers) full of the less liked people of an incredibly stringent society under an oppressive regime supported by an even more oppressive regime. Most of these people did not read and write and the church was mostly an underground network well into 300AD and the gospels were shared as oral tradition. This is also just what we can surmise based on cannon and research based on cannon, there are dozens on non canonical gospels that the church refutes and then all the heretics who had different interpretations of the faith but not the power structure of Rome backing them.  Edit to Add: I don’t think I answered this one question directly, Matthew and John were direct followers of Jesus, Mark joined up with Peter in the aftermath and Luke admits he wasn’t in the fold at all but went out to gather eyewitness accounts after to have them collected.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-30T11:15:20,1

"What exactly are you trying to prove or do you think I’m trying to prove? because I have no intentions here. I’m not a theologian and I don’t even consider myself a moderately “good” Catholic. Do you find validity in the ideas of Socrates, Confucius, or Siddhartha Gautama? None of them wrote anything down either, what we do have was written by literate disciples.  I don’t see what your aim is here or who you’re trying to defend but this has nothing to do with my original comment. So what gives?",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-30T16:54:05,1
"No one in their right mind would worship Socrates as the son of a god. Just as neither Confucius nor Buddha claimed to be the son of a god.

"Your looping to make it appear like I’m not answering your questions or making sense, that’s unprofessional. If you have questions ask them, also I was never debating anyone in any of my comments. I made a comment about Christ specifically never mentioning abortion or homosexuality. If you have an interest in Christ and the faith ask them and I can try me best to answer them with the caveat that I’m neither a theologian or someone who necessarily believes the authority of the Church. I was raised a Catholic Anarchist and honestly a folk catholic at that.",im_a_teenagelobotomy,2025-04-30T17:44:21,1
