"This title is brilliant.   Also, ""The MMR vaccine contains a lot aborted fetus debris and DNA particles, so they don't want to take it""  LMFAO Bro What?!?! I know who this is coming from so I don't take it serious, but even for RFK Jr. That's a wild ass take. What is actually mentally wrong with him?",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T14:14:24,31
at the end of the day when people knowingly allow someone in power to spread lies that will kill children how do you not call them evil?  i thought one of the parents of those poor kids who dies from measles would wake up and turn their back on the orange cult but they said it was fine.  some days i truly think we are done as a society and there is no way to fix this maga death cult damage,AngryTomJoad,2025-05-02T14:21:46,9

Can’t wait till the brain worm fetus particulate starves his brain from further O2. Dudes going to have hundreds of thousands of Americans dead at the end of four years.,Stalwart_Wisdom,2025-05-02T21:36:42,1
"DNA particles is very funny because if you want to avoid taking in dna particles you’d need to stop eating, because all food is from living things and thus contains dna or at least dna “particles”. Also don’t breathe because you’ll inhale some bacteria that contain dna.",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-02T14:33:48,17
"Secretary Pestilence has a parasitic worm that consumed part of his brain.  He also gave himself mercury poisoning, which does a number on a person's mental faculties.  He was also a heroin junkie, which he claims makes you smarter (!)  Hear that kids, heroin for everyone!  The Secretary of Health and Human Services says it makes you smarter!  His role in this administration is to kill as many Americans as possible, since Trump's attempt during his first administration only killed a million.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-02T14:56:23,4
"He went to the measles kid's funeral and took a smiling photo with the family, all the adults, parents and Bobby brainworm were grinning like it was so great. The kids, the siblings of the dead child , looked traumatized. They know their parents wouldn't have cared if they were the one that died. It's sad and gross.

"""Three out of four of our children survived, so we don't regret not vaccinating them""  Absolute lunatic stuff. When my dog ate one out of several baby cactuses that I was growing from seed, I realized that I'd fucked up by putting them where the dog could get at them and immediately moved the survivors. To keep going down the same idiot path when it's cost you one of your own children . . . the mind boggles.",tinfoil-sombrero,2025-05-02T14:41:22,3

Bet those types eat salt by the handful and drink only patriotic petrochemical ethanol. They’d huff 100% pure no-additive added O2 straight from a  tank but that sounds like wearing a mask and that is woke.,BrujaSloth,2025-05-02T15:22:17,6
DNA is scary stuff.    Even more scary than chemicals.     You don’t ever want to put either of these in your body.   ,Malumeze86,2025-05-02T14:48:21,3
Also don't have se- nvm RFK definitely will never avoid taking in DNA particles.,DifficultyNo7758,2025-05-02T20:11:44,1
"For actual sane takes from a vaccine skeptic long before vaccines were as safe and normalized as they are today, you can look to Benjamin Franklin.  > “In 1736, I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if the child died under it: my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.”  In 1736 I wouldn’t have judged anyone harshly for being a vaccine skeptic. They were still new fangled and there were real risks associated with them. Now almost 300 years later… none of that remains true.",RoadkillVenison,2025-05-02T14:54:56,3
