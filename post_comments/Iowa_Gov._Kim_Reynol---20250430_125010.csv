I'm in favor of no phones in school but it should be school policy instead of a State law. Based on the reports it looks like they did it the right way.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-30T13:33:01,23
Never had phones except the main office or nurses office. Didn't hurt us to not be in communication 24/7.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T15:30:49,11

"Good for them.  The only students who should have phones are those who use them for medical devices, and it should only be allowed for that purpose only.",thechaoticstorm,2025-05-03T11:45:39,1
"Oh man, as far as I knew allowing cell phones in school is the standard, and it takes a lot of effort to have them banned.",atcmaybe,2025-04-30T14:35:14,11
They were borderline mandatory in my high school as teachers regularly had phone-assisted activities,Skyrimosity,2025-04-30T17:47:47,4
"Why? If a parent needs to get ahold of a child, they can call the school and get the child out of class. It worked for  decades before smart phones.  Let them focus on school.",uponone,2025-04-30T19:28:06,17
Maybe times have changed? I went to high school in the late 2000s.,Zaphenzo,2025-04-30T15:38:50,7
"I graduated in 2013, they were not allowed at that time, and they didn't appear to be budging on the rule at all. This change has probably occurred over the last 6 or 7 years. This is the parents' fault. Parents feel like they deserve the right to communicate with their children at any moment during the school day, and there is an argument that they are right. My opinion is that the negatives of kids having phones at school outweigh the positives. High schoolers need to learn to be independent from their parents and communicate with those around them, developing real social skills. Kids are drinking less, smoking less, and partying less than they have in the last 80 years, but they are also more depressed than they ever have been. The days of forming core memories during those crucial years of your life are over for the majority of kids.",gaytheistfedora,2025-04-30T20:15:37,13
