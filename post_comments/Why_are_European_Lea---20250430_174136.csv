"There was a global pandemic which triggered massive inflation due to supply chain crisis and at the same time that this was going on, many nations suddenly faced a massive influx of immigrants from war torn or otherwise struggling countries.  These became hot button issues all across the world and in many cases, the incumbent leaders paid the price for a situation that was frankly largely outside of their control.   My best guess is the low ratings today are a result of either lingering effects of that or the result of the new leaders who ran on alleviating such problems failing to deliver quickly enough on that promise.",DinkandDrunk,2025-04-30T20:01:09,15
"The current Western political consensus is collapsing under the contradiction of Neoliberal economics. What once worked, poorly imo, is now not working at all. There needs to be a shift to a new economic system and political consensus and none of the major parties are really giving alternatives. The only alternatives we're broadly being given is re-warmed Fascism. The current European leaders aren't giving options and therefore aren't popular.

"Structurally it’s not very different from why Trump was elected.  If you look at the long trend, globalization has brought billions in the hands of a few (in post-industrial countries) and the working class and middle classes have been drained, by a stagnation of wages and creeping inflation. It has slowly stifled consuming AND made accumulation of capital and access to property harder every year in the past 30 years.  So middle classes fear the backslide while working classes live increasingly paycheck to paycheck, with the knife of unemployment at their throats. And not that many among these have ideas how to change that but they’re thrashing ; their instinct is that “something has to give”.   A mass of panicking discontents ready to accept scapegoats and simplistic explanations, and roll with far-right agendas promising them to turn the tables on those “experts” and “elites” telling them “that’s just the way it is”. A mass that far-rights historically easily capitalize on.   And that movement is structural and can be observed everywhere in “the west”. The USA had a vulnerability with their 2 party system ; but now even the other democracies have issues holding their extremes at bay. The old “left of the center” - “right of the center” parties have shown themselves unable to really change that slow stagflation strangling the median 50% income slice ; and it shows in the voting booth.  The longer it goes, the harder it is for measured political parties to articulate any project without being simply perceived as “pro status-quo”, while extremes advance (under cover of being “disruptive”) agendas of actual malice.   This isn’t unlike the whole climate of the 1930’s ; and it won’t be “fixed” quickly, and definitely not painlessly either.",Brisbanoch30k,2025-05-01T02:46:35,3

"Well, I'm from Romania. I think I can share a point of view here.  We got our Presidential elections canceled in December, and things have become dirtier since then. Our elected President resigned in February due to his huge unpopularity (according to the polls, around 15% of the entire country felt sorry for him when he left). He wrote a public letter before the parliamentary elections last year, in which he apologized for not fulfilling our expectations during his 10 years presidency. He won his second term with more than 60% in the second round in 2019. Why? Because his opponent was our resigned prime minister, Viorica Dăncilă, a woman from the PSD (social populist party). She was quite a shame, sometimes she could not put two words together, so technically she was the perfect opponent for Iohannis.  We have 7 parties in the Parliament: 22% PSD, 14% PNL (center-right liberal), 12% USR (liberal), 18% AUR (far-right), 6% POT (far-right), 7% S.O.S. (far-right), 6% UDMR (we have a Hungarian minority, and it's their party) - these are the election results from December 2024. The entire mass-media divides them between Pro-Europeans (left and centre-right parties), and nationalists (far-right). They picture each other as the biggest enemies of all time.  But it's not that simple. The PNL and the PSD, despite representing exactly the opposite ideologically, are the two main governmental parties since 2022. Before forming a government, they had bullied each other every single day for more than 10 years.  And there is more... The first opponent of Iohannis was Ponta in 2014, the former leader of the PSD, former PM, and former advisor of the current PM (PSD). He is running for the Presidential Office, and he is a huge fan of Georgescu (who would be the AUR's Presidential candidate, and rumour says his last campaign was financed by the PNL, but he's not allowed to run anymore). And the current leader of the AUR was captured by a paparazzi leaving Ponta's house a few years ago, when Ponta did not have any important role in politics. And lastly, AUR was offered votes from PSD in the canceled Presidential elections last year (why would you give votes to your biggest enemy?!).  The USR wants to join the governmental coalition after the Presidential elections.  Putting these together, we do not have a clear, democratic choice. It doesn't really matter who we vote, we choose the entire establishment anyways. They distribute every single position between them, and by finding the perfect opponents, we vote with the ""least shitty"" ones in every single time. The rest is just theater.  This is why the Romanians are not satisfied with any leader or political party. We do not have a voice or a choice after all.",LegalFun1822,2025-05-01T21:36:35,2
"People are unimpressed with the lives they have due to the superstructure of Capitalism.  Capitalism is the cohesive political force of the State.

"TL;DR: politicians mostly represent the very wealthy, so wealth inequality is becoming increasingly intolerable.   There are a variety of specific domestic issues (like Brexit in the UK), but the main factors I would point to are covid and wealth inequality.   Covid shut down countries economy while they printed money. This caused a lot of economic hardship and inflation for everyone except the already wealthy, whose wealth exploded during the pandemic. This exacerbated the underlining problem of wealth inequality.   European countries, like the US, have generally allowed the rich to siphon off massive amounts of wealth to the top while the rest of us suffer, via rent seeking, market manipulation, tax dodging, corruption, etc. etc.   For further info, I recommend Garys Economics on youtube",Wogley,2025-04-30T18:24:41,2
They dont need to be popular.  Their party just need enough support (usually in a coalition with others) to attain the right to govern.  That usually pans out to be around the 20% mark (in most parlimentary systems wih more than two parties) wich would in turn also equate to the percentage of the population that think they do a swell job.,ren_reddit,2025-05-01T00:19:40,1
"There is also a correlation between a high standard of living (HDI) and freedom of the press, as well as a lower approval rating for the presidents due to a more critical media landscape.   This means that although people in many European countries tend to be more dissatisfied with their presidents, they have a higher standard of living than people in Russia, for example, where Putin is said to have a relatively high approval rating among the population. This may also have to do with the fact that in european democratic countries is greater freedom of the press, meaning that the population is better informed about the government's mistakes and therefore views the government much more critically.",Xrdhz,2025-05-01T15:53:15,1

"In my country (Norway) there are 10 different political parties represented in the Norwegian parliament. 40% support would be massive for any party. However, people often support a popular prime minister even if they didn’t vote for his/her party. I think the unpopularity of European leaders has to do with several things: 1) Inflation. Rising prices will always make politicians unpopular. 2) Immigration. Some say it’s too high and that we’ve let in too many from Africa and the Middle East. I believe this problem is a bit overblown. It’s scapegoating. The wave of American right wing propaganda in social media did reach Europe as well. 3) The wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

"For the UK.  \- Mass Immigration from Carribean and Middle East. Entire cities are basically having natives ""forced"" out, there are entire areas of the UK where white people are a minority now. London alone is now majority Immigrant. On top of this, Mass immigration has led to Ethnic enclaves that collapse very rapidly into crime, poor maintenance, rubbish everywhere, wetmarkets etc and completely destroyed whatever local culture is in this place.  \- Bad Faith ramroading of Multiculturalism and rewriting history. Now Black people were seemingly 40% of the population in medieval England according to British Television. ""UK is a nation of Immigrants"" all through museums and such with black people and muslims in traditional english garb through history. My friends and I love counting demographics in commercials now, and if you go by commercials, the UK is easily 80% black. Everyone hates this even the most ardant lefties and it feels like mass gaslighting.  \- Bad Faith political leadership. Starmer and the Labour Right destroyed Corbyn and the Labour Left through a mass effort of bad faith antisemitism smears (See what Trump is doing? This played out between 2016-2020 in the UK) and other sorts of bad faith allegations along with rampant backstabbing especially around Brexit. They won the leadership on bad faith positions, they spent their time in leadership of the opposition being vague but alluding to previous positions, they got into power and pretty much laughed in the publics face for believing what they had said, and have become even further to the right than the Tories they had beaten. The Labour right are a pathologically bad faith, frankly, narcissistic political movement that have been gaslighting the British people for a decade now. Luke Ackhurst, one of their most rabid, sociopathic attack dogs, was parachuted into one of the most traditionally left wing areas in the UK (It has Marx and Engels as icons in their local parade), and now the council has been lost to Reform of all parties.  \- Political leadership refusing to actually do anything but do the Tories, but ""harder"". UK needs massive structural and transformative reform. Everybody knows this. The Labour Government is completely uninterested in even bringing up any structural topics that aren't ""austerity but harder"". Starmer was a massive proponent always for HoL reform, but now it's completely gone.  \- Gaza. Frankly, everyone and their dog can see the Labour party and much of the British Establishment are completely caputred by Zionist interests in particular the Israeli embassy, it led to mass interference in 2 elections working hand in hand with the media and Labour Right (2017 and 2019) and the UK now has a large muslim population that is seeing genocide being carried out on an culturally arabized population with full throat support of the UK. Starmer even stood on stage with Pro-Settlers as they spouted genocidal rhetoric against Palestinians, denying them even personhood and Starmer supported Israel's use of starvation as a weapon. ""Gaza independents"" have become a huge issue for Labour especially as the Labour core base is very pro-Gaza.  \- Prices and Wages. UK has atrocious wages, the average Brit outside of London, as the same wealth as people living in the poorest US states, but UK cost of living is equivilent to Australia. You can basically bounce to Australia and get 2x the wage of a senior position in the UK in an entry level job, and even more if you move to the US,  and many Brits know and do this. UK is one of the most University, degree holding, highly skilled workforces on earth and has some of the worst wages in the developed world. The Labour party is in power and what are they doing? Trying to fight *""Wage inflation"".*  \- Housing Crisis. Not unique to the UK. The UK like most Anglosphere countries, moved to a FIRE based economy using Real Estate as a giant ponzi scheme. Now most people's wealth is locked up in the house so they oppose any and all house building, leaving pretty much anyone 45 and under completely borked with insane rents or mortgages. With Mass Immigration, people's rents are rising far faster than wages. You are looking at 30% YoY rent growth in UK cities. Are peoples wages going up 30%? Nope.",VampKissinger,2025-05-05T03:47:31,1

"AOC's little case study poll after the election is a fascinating insight into this very dynamic. The people in her district that voted for Trump but ALSO voted for her did so because they felt like she and Trump alike would take a wrecking ball to the establishment. They didn't care that Trump was talking about tariffs and mass deportations. They didn't care that AOC and Trump are in many ways completely ideologically incompatible with each other. They just wanted change so bad they pledged their vote to whomever was better at promising it.  This is also why Obama's campaign was so strong in '07. He ran on a platform of change. McCain was just another old white Republican that represented the status quo. Obama was a (relatively) young black(!) man who ran on a platform of shaking up the system and making things work for the American people. Of course those promises never panned out. But he did enough good that it got him reelected in 2011.  The public also has a very worrying trend to believe that the things that can only be spoken about in whispers are the actual truth. It doesn't matter how outlandish or inhumane an idea may be, if you can't talk about it in polite society? Then it's because the elites don't want you to know about it. Acadameia = elites, and Academia says fascism bad, so maybe fascism good???

"What you suggest is mutually exclusive. How do you even theoretically envision ""rebalanced the economy in favor of those who work""?    To find economic balance, you need people and economic ressources. If you pair demographic change with lower immigration, you have a massive shortage of people. Hence, you can only try to allocate economic resources away from the old to the working population, so cut pensions, reduce healthcare, higher taxes, etc. You would have to lower the life quality of the old, to increase life quality of the young. But the old are more numerous and have more to lose, so how do you square that politically, and how would that make anyone more popular?   Your last hope now is to change the demographic factor, which is both unfeasible and economically dangerous, because you cannot undo a trend of decades within mere years, even if you pay the biggest incentives to have more children, but at the same time, more children now would make the system collapse, because you pump unproductive people into a system that has labor shortage, hence 2 decades of increased struggling for kindergarten spaces, education, affordable housing, healthcare, etc. Ironically in this context, children are unproductive people leeching ressources for decades, while migrants are labor potential that can be deployed to the market within years or months if we really wanted. So, upside down world, but thats not new, that things are the exact opposite of what blind people claim it to be.    The problem really is that no one ever thinks things through and expects politicians who make politics for those who don't think to do any better.

But because of France’s second-round style elections, a lot of people on the left thought he would be the lesser evil than a far right like Le Pen as president. So look at the parliament: very much divided in numerous parties.  The Netherlands, where I live, has a prime minister that is not even member of a party. People who support one of the four coalition parties might think he’d be doing a good job, but they usually blame him for not doing what their party wants - and the opposition blames him for leading this government in the first place.

Currently too much tax money is spent keeping the elderly alive through pensions and healthcare. Not enough money is spent on infrastructure.  If we reduced the pensions and healthcare slightly, taxes on working people could be lowered.  It’s not a radical take to say the government currently does too much to keep the elderly alive. That should be something your family does or doesn’t do. End of life should be something you prepare for personally, not sponge off the state.  The economy is currently set up so that working people spend an ever increasing percentage of their income to support an ever increasing pool of elderly people. It can’t go on.

"For France, the problem is that 40% will vote for the far-right as first choice, 10% will vote for the right, 20% will vote for the centrists, 15% will vote for the left and 15% for the far-left.  And since all of them will run at least one major candidate and the first round of the presidential election keeps the two candidates who obtains the most votes for the second round, then it means the second-round will be the far-right candidate vs the centrist candidate, with the votes of the far-left, the left, the centrists  and most of the right going to the centrist candidate and voting them in power.  But only 20% of the country wanted the centrists in power, it is just that 60% would rather have had the centrist in power than the fascist.  Then Macron made an alliance with the right to govern the country with center-right policies, excluding the left from power, which makes the left mad at him for basically taking their vote for the second round of the presidential election for granted and never making concessions to them afterwards, instead treating them as enemies. But the left often makes alliances with the far left which the centrists hate as much as the far right, so it is not entirely Macron's fault.  So in the end, you have 40% of far-right voters and 30% of left and far-left voters who hate Macron for being their political opponent, and there is no way for him to ever have more than 30% popularity.  The system was more stable in the past (meaning 30 years ago), because it was dominated by the right-wing and the left-wing parties which each easily gained 20% of the votes, and the far-right was at 15% and never got the second round of the presidential election. But then the far-right vote started to rise, and there were a series of bad presidents both on the right and the left that ended alienating most of their voters who then moved permanently to the far-right, the far-left, or the center instead.  But the system is still stable. We have a centrist president (Macron) and a centrist prime minister (Bayrou) heading a minority government backed by an alliance between the centrists and the right. This centrist prime minister can only be overthrown by an alliance between the far right, the far left, and the left, which can only happen if he tries to take controversial measures and pisses off everyone else, as his predecessor, the right-wing politician Barnier eventually did.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-05-01T03:16:32,2

"As someone involved in Canadian politics, you're kinda missing what the collapse of the NDP and the Bloc actually represents. Especially in the case of the NDP, Canadians tend to run to the Liberals when they're scared. Because we use a First Past the Post system, a vote for the NDP or the Bloc in a race they don't have a clear win in is generally effectively a vote for a Conservative, since the major right wing parties amalgamated 20 years ago. So when presented with a Conservative party the majority of Canadians see as too closely aligned with the MAGA movement and generally too extreme, they turn to the center-left party that will at least acknowledge their goals and values as legitimately held even if they disagree about how to pursue them. A Dipper would prefer, say, building more social housing to solve the housing crisis than the government acting as a developer for private housing, but it's still better than 'cut taxes and let the free market sort it out'. Similarly, a Bloquiste may in their heart of hearts want an independent Quebec, but Liberals will at least give concessions to Quebec interests they don't trust the Conservatives to. The collapse of the NDP and Bloc *is* a rejection of the Conservatives, it's just expressed in NDP and Bloc voters holding their noses and voting Liberal to make sure the Conservatives don't get in.",VodkaBeatsCube,2025-05-02T07:25:07,1
"The problem with using the raw GDP value is that its very susceptible to currency exchange rates fluctuations, which makes it pretty useless for saying if there is actual growth or not. Using that stat the EU has 10% higher GDP now than three months ago, not because of actual growth but because the dollar dropped 10% in value so EU's X euros of GDP is now worth more dollars even if they dont actually produce more than three months ago. PPP fixes that problem as its not based on the spot rates.  Great example of that is 2002-2008, if you take a look at that period the [EUs nominal GDP grew from $8.1T to $16.37T](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=EU), an annualized growth of 12.4%! No advanced economy can actually increase its output by that much in that short of a time frame. The reason behind this huge growth is that the [EUR/USD went from 0.86 in Jan'02 to 1.58 in Mar'08](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DEXUSEU). And then in 2008-2020 the reverse was happening, the EUR/USD was steadily dropping back to about 1.1 which made it seem like the EU's economy had no growth even if in reality it did, it was just masked by the dropping exchange rates.  It can be argued that its better to use euros directly instead of PPP. This has its own flaws, as not all EU countries use euro, but let's say we're fine with that. In **real** euro terms, [the EU recovered in 2014](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CLVMNACSCAB1GQEU272020), in nominal terms - [in 2011](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPMNACSCAB1GQEU272020). The growth rate wasn't very good (about 1.4% annualized in real terms since q1 2009, 3.5% in nominal), but it was not terrible (US had 2.2% real growth rate for context).  Edit:   You can also see it like this - if you did the same thing in reverse (i.e. calculate the US GDP in euros) then you could conclude that the US had a gigantic recession in 2002-2008 where the economy contracted from 12.5T euros to 9.4T euros in nominal terms (or 16.7T -> 10.7T in ""real"" terms), but that doesn't make sense, does it?

">Don't confuse a general alliance for an actual party.  It literally doesnt matter, this alliance basically work as one party during elections and effectively create a ""two party system"" - if you not as political party member of any of those two alliances, there is very small chance to actually get any of those seats. And thats all what matters. ""Two party system"" doesnt mean there will be actually legally two parties, it could be two factions as well.

They keep their structure, but they together as coalition effectively work as one party.  >in the Philippines  What I meant you cannot promote a Phillipines as a good example of exception, because its not pure FPTP system. Even its only slightly mixed, it can widely change the strategy of voters, which wont be as much maximalistic as in the pure FPTP system.  Also two-party systems happens only if both parties and voters are rational.  Thats means that party wants to maximalize their turnout in whole country and especially in swing districts, meanwhile voters wants to promote the policies which are closests what they supports and prevent parties which are against what they support (I dont want to use word ""want"" because it can be misleading). Thats eventually by every elections should in FPTP lead to two-party system, because voting for prefered small party means that party you as voter hate has bigger chance to win and another third moderate party you are okay with lose.  If there is country as philippines, which is divided among strong regional identities, where parties are not universal to whole country, but operate mainly in their home regions.  And those which are catch-all universal parties like Lakas are constantly breaking apart, due to internal disagreements inside the party. If you look at parties in parliament most of the parties with biggest turnout in parliament (National unity party) are just split off branches of Lakas or Nationalist party with strongmen and strong personalities, which constanly oportunistically divide and merging together.

"What you are describing is recent history in most places.  There are far longer histories of the development of political parties in Europe, with certain centuries and decades of history, say, varied and various types and degrees of Revolutions, Wars, and, really quite importantly, the events of the period commonly described as the Cold War.  In the U.K, for example.  The Conservatives tend to represent business and the rich.  Labour, at least historically, following the Industrial Revolution, came to be the Party seen to represent the workers.  Then came other parties for other interests.  There was a Fascist Party before the war.   There are Social Democrats and Greens and others.  Other nations have other histories.  The significant history of Europe has had significant impacts on the resulting expression of political thought through political parties and concepts of governance.  The idea is, to the People, that by supporting smaller parties to be part of the political process, it can represent specific interests.  In some countries, there are a lot of specific interests based on a lot of very varied groups of social and political history, cultures and identities, and it makes sense for them.  It works.  Multiple party governments are supported by the State because they have the required number of members to constitute a political party.  They have supporters.  They represent them.  It works because if parties lose favour and support, then they no longer have the numbers to summon State support.  That doesn't mean that money doesn't play a massive role in Party Politics, of course, but it does not eliminate smaller parties or the people who's interests they represent.  It functions because parties team together on things of mutual import in some places, and that tends to be of importance to a lot more people than one party alone.  It depends on the system.
