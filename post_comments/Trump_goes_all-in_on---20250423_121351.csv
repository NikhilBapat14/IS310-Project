"Here’s a simple rule for complex times:  You know that a thing is a lie if you’re hearing it from a president with a ‘perfect’ medical, who shits his pants in public.",AINonsense,2025-04-23T12:23:25,11

Can someone explain how covid is a deadly diabolical Chinese plot while simultaneously being harmless/“like the flu”? Which is it?,washu_z,2025-04-23T14:15:42,6
I never understood this.  There is a chance it came from a lab. There is bigger chance it didn't.  The fact remains Trump F-Ked up the response and a lot of people died.    It reminds me of wildfires that wipe out whole cities.  Were they started by some idiot's cigarette or by lightening.  I really don't care. I care more about putting the fires out and saving lives.,Captain_Aware4503,2025-04-23T13:12:08,7

"It has more holes than substance. And it has about as much substance as if you were to put one Tylenol pill in Lake Tahoe, stirred, waited 10 years, went to a different part of Lake Tahoe, filled a 10 millileter dropper with water from that part, and tested said water for the active ingredients on Tylenol.",NeoMegaRyuMKII,2025-04-23T12:27:56,1
Now that Trump is spreading the theory then you know it's false.  I think the whole world knows that covid started from a man eating bat soup.,dbag3o1,2025-04-23T13:05:21,1
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Even liberal Pro Publica has reported that a lab leak is the probable cause.,failures-abound,2025-04-23T12:26:24,-3
"See that is the whole point.  If Trump though it was a biological attack scenario he basically let it happen in total.  Not only that, but he removed the pandemic response team in advance.   Kind of what he just did with the cyber-security team.",TintedApostle,2025-04-23T12:33:17,12
"> Even liberal Pro Publica has reported that a lab leak is the probable cause.  The [Pro Publica article](https://www.propublica.org/article/senate-report-covid-19-origin-wuhan-lab) basically expounds on a Senate Interim report saying “the hypothesis of a natural zoonotic origin no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt”.    Thing is, Dr Fauci and everyone who discusses the issue have said all along that a lab leak couldn't be ruled out, but viral transmission from animals to humans is most likely because it happens all the time  The Senate report statement isn't conclusive; it's leans more to a lab leak than Fauci's statement but we're talking shades of grey  And it's fair to say Senate report was prepared during trump's first term, and we know trump likes science to agree with him",nucumber,2025-04-23T13:11:02,6
"> Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  PoopyPants is right twice a decade or less.  (*btw, a stopped clock is still wrong 86,398 seconds per day.*)",AINonsense,2025-04-23T12:45:55,2
"> Kind of what he just did with the cyber-security team.  Except, (I believe) his ditching pandemic response teams and measures was just his inimitable dumbass vandal fuckries.  Unlike cyber security, I don’t expect Vladimir told him ‘Smash that. Day 1.’",AINonsense,2025-04-23T12:44:23,4
