"I really want AOC to run in 2028. A Vance v AOC debate would be hilarious. And AOC is not nearly as popular as she thinks she is. She thinks having a big Twitter following means she gets that many votes. While that wouldn't be nearly enough votes to win, it's also the case a large chunk of those followers are bots and foreigners.",Zaphenzo,2025-04-30T13:47:00,6
