"Misleading my ass.  The news needs to stop saying ""misleading"" and ""deporting US citizens"".  They are misleading by using these phrases.  The proper term for saying exactly the opposite of a truth is a ""lie"", and the US citizens are not being deported... if they were, they would still be here, in their country of origination/citizenship.  They are being kidnapped and exiled without due process.",ultralightdude,2025-05-03T15:17:00,211
“We have a meeting in the conference room” is a misleading statement to get someone to a surprise office birthday party. “Your prices are lower because of me” is a just a big fat orange lie.,TeslaProphet,2025-05-03T16:29:59,31

"Can we change misleading to lie or misinformation?   >Trump claimed last month that gasoline prices had fallen as low as $1.98 in a couple of states. On Friday, Trump voiced a similar assertion on social media, saying, ""Gasoline just broke $1.98 a Gallon, lowest in years.""  >The nationwide average price of a gallon of gasoline stands at $3.18, AAA data shows. No state boasts an average price close to $1.98, the data shows.",kupomu27,2025-05-03T15:49:44,14

The talk of “harboring illegals is a crime” has already started in MAGA circles. Years of conditioning to believe the rules don’t apply when dealing with “criminals”.
