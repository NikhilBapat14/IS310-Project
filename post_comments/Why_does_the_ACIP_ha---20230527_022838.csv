"The ACIP is an advisory committee. These sorts of committees are set up to give federal agencies access to expertise outside the government, but advisory committees don’t actually *run* anything and membership is closer to “occasional volunteer work” than “job.” Actually running a federal research enterprise is a full-time job that involves lots of bureaucracy and administrative work, and that’s not what the doctors on ACIP volunteered to do. Their job is just to read the research and make recommendations. If they think more research is needed they can ask for it, but that research would be managed by other parts of CDC (or by NIH, other federal agencies, universities, and/or private companies).   Because research is managed by full-time federal employees (either running labs or issuing grants) and not by ACIP, ACIP’s own expenses are very low. Voting members are optionally paid a token amount ($250 per day spent attending a meeting, which works out to like $1500 a year), and non-voting members are unpaid. The only significant expenses are travel costs for the three annual two-day in-person meetings and the costs for a handful of federal employees to support the committee itself (stuff like organizing the meetings, distributing information, running mailing lists, dealing with travel expenses, etc.)",cpast,2023-05-30T22:17:04,1
