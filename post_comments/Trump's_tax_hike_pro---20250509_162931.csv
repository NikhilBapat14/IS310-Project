Bush sr literally ran on a “I won’t raise taxes” campaign. Trump has never done such a thing. My dad still bitches about him capping the salt tax deduction his first term. It’s also not the 80s it’s 2025 and people are pissed at how badly billionaires and their corporations have raked over the middle and lower classes. The only people pissed are the super rich- there’s not that many of them and not all of them are even in his camp.  And most importantly- he doesn’t need to worry about reelection so he can do whatever tf he wants…like he’s always done even when there was something to lose,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T18:33:50,18
Not a fan of higher taxes but Bush got screwed by the Dems by believing their lie that if he increased taxes they would lower spending.   This is why nobody should again trust them until AFTER they lower spending. Which they will never do.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-09T18:11:20,7
Well there goes Trump's chances of being re-elected,woailyx,2025-05-09T17:18:25,12
Bush was a cut and dry neocon and Trump is a borderline populist. Sure their both Republican presidents but this sells a lot better as a populist policy.  I don’t think it happens (in a meaningful way at least) but I do think Trumps style of politics and the current state of the GOP voters gives him a lot more wiggle room,BlubberWall,2025-05-09T16:48:28,10
"Wasn't the whole thing with Bush SR. that he said that then Congress overpowered him? The way I recall, I don't think it was his fault taxes were raised.",Nianque,2025-05-09T17:53:30,3
Dang an extra 2.6% if I make over 2.5 million dollars. It affects so many.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-09T19:43:59,4
