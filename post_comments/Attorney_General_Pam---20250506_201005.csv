Weird to see a drug bust that actually removes harmful drugs from the streets rather than them busting an illicit pot farm and acting like they did anything other than make junk food companies profits drop half a percent.  Rare DEA W indeed.,Notlookingsohot,2025-05-06T20:36:27,4

"70,000 people died from Fentanyl last year, but Pam Bondi claims she saved 258,000,000 lives with her drug bust, sucking up to praise Trump.",TodayTerrible,2025-05-07T07:26:06,1
"[Here is the C-Span version](https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/attorney-general-bondi-holds-news-conference-on-drug-enforcement-efforts/659533)  TLDW - they found lots of drugs labeled as one thing but laced with fentanyl. And be aware that illicit drugs could have fentanyl .  They seized 11.5 kilos (25 lbs) of fentanyl including **3 million fentanyl pills marked as Oxycodone** - the fentanyl was in various amounts. The drugs were located in Phoenix, Albuquerque, and (sic) Utah.  From the Sinaloa organization. The lead was in Salem, Oregon, where they found 5 million dollars in cash.   They found 35 kilos (77 lbs) of methamphetamine, 7.5 kilos (16 lbs) of cocaine, 4 kg (9 lbs) of heroin, 49 rifles and pistols.   So - if you or your kids are in **Phoenix or Albuquerque or Utah (or Salem, Oregon)** - heads up on the safety of street drugs. They didn't list other places where the group sold drugs.",lady__jane,2025-05-06T20:11:19,0

They show the bags and pills and puffed up chests. There'd have to be a lot of liars.,lady__jane,2025-05-06T23:50:25,2
"She got the math wrong on people saved. She didn't lie about the bags of fentanyl pills. Too many people around. It's believable. 7,500 pounds (from another broadcast) in 100 days is good but not freakishly good. Biden's take for all four years was 64,000 - so 16,000 pounds a year. I hope this doesn't mean the cartels are expanding.",lady__jane,2025-05-07T00:12:13,2
"She messed up badly on her life-saving estimates - we only have about 330 million people here (or 360 million with undocumented estimates). The amount of drugs are of actual weighed bags and should be actual, not estimated. Maybe 25,800 lives? 2,580? lives?",lady__jane,2025-05-07T10:38:45,3

Did you accidentally write meth twice or did they actually say it like the full name and abbreviated names were different drugs?,cyanescens_burn,2025-05-07T02:15:55,0
"There's a lot of angst there... But... Yeah. In the last 60 years, Americans have bought into the following toxic ideas:  - Self sufficiency is a virtue -- meaning we are unwilling to ask for help for we don't need it. - The primacy of the nuclear family -- meaning we are unwilling to ask for help for we have everything we need from our partners and we must make it work. - Protestant work ethic -- meaning we are unwilling to ask for help for we just need to work harder. - American Exceptionalism -- meaning we are unwilling to ask for help for we are perfect.   Guess what? We need help.. but drugs will also work.",Grandpa_No,2025-05-06T20:33:32,7
"Plus, you know, our government historically running operations/experiments with the actual intent of drugging people or spreading drugs. And the whole opioid crisis thanks to our healthcare system.   Considering all the factors at play, it’s kind of impressive more people aren’t on drugs.",Emilia_Violet,2025-05-06T20:29:47,2
She claimed it was 258 million in the first 100. Another 25 million is a strong start to the next 100 but they have to double the pace if they want to save everyone on the planet without dipping into his third term.   At the current rate they won’t quite even reach 4 billion lives saved.,specqq,2025-05-06T21:47:15,2
