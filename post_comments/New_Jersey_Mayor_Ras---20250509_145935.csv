They arrested him on public property as he was not in the gates. What was the charge?   Bet there isn’t one and they just wanted a photo op and scare tactic.,DelightfulAbsurdity,2025-05-09T16:26:21,18
"“The agents started intimidating and putting their hands on the congresswomen. There was yelling and pushing,” Martinez said. “Then the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.”  So they can attempt to intimidate anyone they choose but as soon as someone calls them out they are in handcuffs. Insanity.",cap123abc,2025-05-09T15:04:52,34
