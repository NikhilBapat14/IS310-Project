The EPA should have been dismantled under the first Trump administration. It is nothing but the government weaponized against business.,HonoraryNwb,2025-05-09T18:39:06,2
"They should stick to the real mission, I absolutely don’t want the EPA scuttled, they do awesome things like close down those polluting rivers and streams with toxic chemicals, make those asshats pay for it, then drive the fix/changes, and if needed cleanup.  I’m good with limiting pollution when it’s not clearly being used as a tool to shut down entire industries.",cliffotn,2025-05-09T21:42:53,2
