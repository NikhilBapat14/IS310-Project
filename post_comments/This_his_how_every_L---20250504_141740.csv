Sit down and shut your lips. An atheist who just watched Conclave has something important to tell you about your religion.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-04T17:33:24,19
Democrats are Catholic when it supports their world view. For the most part they don't follow any religious group 100%. They tend to just create their own tenants as they dictate. Unfortunately Republicans can fall into the same category.,AdagioVast,2025-05-04T15:29:48,-1

"Let me prove it so that this is not a controversial statement.   1) Democrats tend to support values like abortion and transgenderism, when these are clearly not tenants of the Catholic church nor should they be in the Christian sense. Abortion violates the sanctity of human life, and transgenderism denies the fundamental existence of oneself by accepting an existence that is not in congruence with reality. Therefore you would think they would be against Catholicism in a sense, and generally they tend to be very vocal about the Church.  2) Republicans tend to not support abortion and transgenderism, but they seem to be rather harsh towards immigrants. The USCCB even came out against the GOP for their rather harsh rhetoric towards migrants. The USCCB have been outspoken against the GOPs actions against cuts in social programs that help the poor.   Granted the GOP does a MUCH better job at keeping to the tenants of the CC, however they still seem to have a cafeteria style mentality that also forgets other tenants. I would argue the DNC is a far worse offender.",AdagioVast,2025-05-05T08:40:25,-1
Wrong. Not many of us cared about the pope pic. And no one said ditch Christianâ€™s thatâ€™s a way to lose elections. We say take the foot off the pedal of the abortion issue. Itâ€™s hugely unpopular amongst libertarians and moderates and only serves the far end of the voter spectrum. Donâ€™t misrepresent thatâ€™s what democrats do,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-04T15:27:21,-6

"No one is saying abandon Christians. You keep intentionally misrepresenting it, and Iâ€™m pretty sure youâ€™re doing it on purpose. Weâ€™re saying Christian values shouldnâ€™t have a chokehold on the party. Separation of church and state all day long. Secularism. Conservative principles should drive the legislation not Christian religious beliefs. Ofc there is overlap between the 2 but religion doesnâ€™t drive the party bus. We are a party of conservatives that has some Christians not a party of Christians who are conservative. The difference is imperative.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-04T15:42:53,12

"To be fair, even most Democrats agree with having reasonable restrictions on abortion, but it's the radical ones in charge they keep trying to remove all restrictions on abortion, which causes the Republicans go hard the other way.",scrapqueen,2025-05-04T16:14:05,-3
Oh look at you misrepresenting and saying stuff literally no one said again. You sure you arenâ€™t a progressive cause you sure argue like one? In terrible faith. Have a nice night.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-04T15:53:10,6

"Harris wanted to expand abortion rights beyond even what Roe v. Wade allowed, create federal laws that limited state's rights to regulate abortion, make the abortion pill more easily accessible, and get rid of the Hyde amendment which prohibits the use of taxpayer funding of abortions.  Walz, as governor of Minnesota, signed into law a bill making elective abortion legal through all nine months of pregnancy and not requiring doctors to provide life saving care to infants born alive during a late term abortion.",scrapqueen,2025-05-04T16:55:43,-2
