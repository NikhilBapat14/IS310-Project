The worst part is that they are basically immune to criticism (and obviously any political repercussion).   They blamed Hunter for trading and dealing off of his dad’s name when the Trump spawn literally run a company emblazoned with their dumb family name. It’s absolute hypocrisy.,NoCoffee6754,2025-05-05T11:22:53,6

"Trump himself is manipulating markets, and launched a meme coin when he took office.
