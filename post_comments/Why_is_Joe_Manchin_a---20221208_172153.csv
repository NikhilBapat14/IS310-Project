Is that ""legitimate?"" Well, Manchin seems to think so, but there's hardly an objective answer here. Studying the effects of raising the minimum wage is a frustratingly hard thing to do, and at a certain point you kind of have to pick what information you think is relevant and what isn't.",mormagils,2022-12-12T09:29:59,3
"One of the arguments he made last time around was that the cost of living is not the same everywhere in the U.S., So a $15 minimum wage might make sense in NYC or SF but not in West Virginia. (He is right about the cost of living being higher in some places, but I believe $15 is still below the cost of living almost everywhere).   He said he could be open to a more modest increase, but the Senate parliamentarian ruled that a Minimum Wage increase coulden't go in a reconciliation bill, and Manchin said he would not provide the vote to overrule the parliamentarian.",loselyconscious,2022-12-16T04:17:42,1

"Manchin is in favor of big businesses and protecting his home district (West Virginia ).  There are plenty of instances in Europe where they have a $15+ minimum wage, and their citizens enjoy a much higher standard of living.

"My question these days is, how much of the country pays anything less than $15 in *effective* minimum wage anymore?    The argument against it used to be that businesses couldn't afford an arbitrary increase and it would kill jobs.  Also that it would cause inflation. Well, the price of everything inflated despite no MW increase, and so now businesses HAVE to pay more or no workers.  I'd be curious who among you can hire anyone for any job for less than $15?  In my area they need to offer $18 to get even get a sniff from high school kids.",Ok-Hurry-4761,2022-12-23T00:33:15,1

1. This article in from Feb 2021 so is almost 2 years old. 2. If an emplyee works for tipps the employer must make up the difference up to minimum wage [https://labor.wv.gov/Wage-Hour/Minimum\_Wage/Documents/Fact%20Sheets/FACT%20SHEET%203%20-%20TIP%20CREDIT%202017.pdf](https://labor.wv.gov/Wage-Hour/Minimum_Wage/Documents/Fact%20Sheets/FACT%20SHEET%203%20-%20TIP%20CREDIT%202017.pdf) 3. Very few people (less than 2%) actually make minimum wage. The real minimum wage should be zero.,StedeBonnet1,2022-12-12T13:35:20,-2
"1. Yes because that was the last time a minimum wage increase was seriously considered by the Senate and Manchin made his views known. It’s still relevant, Manchin hasn’t changed since then. 2. Ok but if the minimum wage is low that doesn’t matter regardless. 3. No. In the real world, a minimum wage of zero leads to slave labor. That is bad. There are many benefits from a minimum wage and no discernible benefits from a zero minimum wage.",dunpyklungo,2022-12-12T20:29:35,8
">No. In the real world, a minimum wage of zero leads to slave labor  Wrong, in the real world wages are a function of skills and experience. In a capitalist society higher minimum wages amounts to discrimination against the inexperience and unskilled. As a result a high minimum wage essentially prices those people out of the workplace. There is no way an unskilled worker can be productive enough to earn $15.00 /hr. So they must start at a lower wage to learn. Minimum wage was actually intended to be a starter wage an entry level wage NOT a living wage. In fact the original wage was intended to keep blacks out of the workplace,",StedeBonnet1,2022-12-13T05:55:06,0
"Sounds like the employer in that case doesn't know how to handle human capital. The economy serves humans, employees included, not the other way around. It's not a tool to extract the most value out of the population, but to create value within that society.  Also, when using terms like ""blacks"", you'll have a very hard time in a sub that is structured around good faith engagement and you'll likely end up getting banned, sooner or later. Just so you know.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-13T14:55:08,4
">Minimum wage was actually intended to be a starter wage an entry level wage NOT a living wage.  That's not true.  https://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/blog/posts/what-did-fdr-mean-by-a-living-wage.htm  In particular:  >It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By 'business' I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white-collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages, I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.  FDR, the creator of the minimum wage, said it should represent a livable wage, and the ""entry level wage"" you're talking about SHOULD BE a livable wage.",ProLifePanda,2022-12-13T16:51:21,5

"Except your article contends that ""it seems that the minimum wage was only intended to serve as the bare minimum for what society would deem an acceptable wage to avoid the exploitation of vulnerable workers and to ensure that no working person would starve in the United States.""  Also, ""This is further evidenced by the fact that FDR continued to propose a rash of other economic programs during the New Deal era and that he touted the minimum wage as a means to spur further economic activity. **In other words, the minimum wage was used as one tool among many** to address the economic plight of Americans.

"Well, I looked it up and the information I found does not seem to support your claim, since those effects were not intended, while indeed harmful to non-unionized workers, largely comprised out of these minority groups.

Less than 2% make the Federal minimum wage. 31% make less than $15 an hour. So 31% of Americans make somewhere between $7.25 and $14.99.,Shakezula84,2022-12-14T11:07:39,2
"Nothing you wrote contradicts his point, tho. Not sure what you’re trying to argue, objectively speaking you’re wrong about the original intent of the min wage still.
