I don't think that Donald Trump thought this all the way through because the reason why Alcatraz closed in the first place was because of his deterioration and major repairs that needed to be done.. Even though it is a tourist attraction now after five decades there is most likely more deterioration and a lot more repairs that need to be done.. The point being is that if this happens and he is able to reopen Alcatraz as a prison all of those repairs and everything else that it needs will take probably a decade to do in which he will no longer be in office and the next president may end up closing it again and making it a tourist attraction again... So it would be pointless for him to do this.,weirdospacebeing,2025-05-04T19:42:28,2

"This is absurd. Had he been watching too many movies?  Alcatraz is a crumbling ruin that’s been shuttered for far longer than it was in use. It was closed because operating it was a major financial drain. Its location resulted in ongoing deterioration from salt water that required regular repairs as well as the need to continuously ship all supplies needed to operate the facility to the island; both of these issues collectively help to raise costs through the roof.  On top of the impracticality of reopening “The Rock”, Alcatraz is today an official U.S. National Historic Landmark and an integral part of the Gateway National Recreation Area, a popular U.S. National Park located along portions of the San Francisco Bay. The park is a magnet for tourism ro the Bay Area and Alcatraz is a notable part of the draw that the park holds.  If Alcatraz was to be reopened, it would first need to be seized from the National Park Service and transferred to the Department of Corrections. The iconic historic facility would then need to be destroyed in its entirety so a new, very costly modern facility could then be built in its place. Not only is this “plan” absurd, it’s just wrong.",DragonDayz,2025-05-04T22:20:34,1
