"The Abundance Agenda is very clearly just monied interests fleeing the Republican Establishment and throwing a bone to progressives.  “Cut regulations and we’ll build your high speed rail! This will be a different country by 2050!”  Read the whole book, liked a lot of the ideas, did not see them happening the way it’s laid out. In reality Big Business would be like “Can we get a tax cut first?” and then they’d be like “So we tried this and it didn’t work. Oh well.”  To me, a big issue is that we’re gonna build all this shit, and that’s gonna devalue people’s houses. Which would be an acceptable trade-off for what is *proposed* but there’s no mention of an accountability structure to make sure the right shit gets built. What if they decide your vertical farm won’t be profitable enough, so they devalue your neighborhood to build luxury condos?",FawningDeer37,2025-05-09T14:19:49,9
How could the Democratic party be sunk any lower than it already is? Politically the Democratic party is a complete no-op at this point.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T16:03:17,4

">Our fear is that this billionaire-backed project is being explicitly used to undermine the kind of populist rebrand necessary to shed Democrats’ reputation as feckless cowards who can’t be trusted to fight for working people  That's powerful writing. I haven't yet read Abundance, but I'm familiar with the discourse around it and understand that monied interests have corrupted pretty much every facet of politics and have created perverse incentives for Democratic politicians.  I guess I'll have to sail the high seas.",Ratermelon,2025-05-09T14:41:50,1
"they can fuck right off. The anti-GOP coalition doesn't just need workers to succeed, it needs billionaires to fail. The success of billionaires means the exploitation of workers. There is no happy ending for everybody, and the oligarchy must be destroyed.",iKill_eu,2025-05-09T14:39:28,0
"*Could* sink?  Can anyone point out any internal leaders keeping it afloat right now? Schumer? Pelosi? Jeffries?  The people are the top who choose the messaging can’t agree and just keep preaching “civility” and voting to approve trumps picks.  You can argue for individuals (Aoc, Bernie, etc) on the national level, and also for certain states and local officials being active - but the party at the top sucks. The dinosaurs that have exponentially grown their wealth and enjoy the attention at the top have made this party weaker every day they’ve been in charge.",Lucky-old-boy,2025-05-09T14:23:33,0
