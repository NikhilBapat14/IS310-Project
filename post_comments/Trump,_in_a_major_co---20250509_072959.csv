Trump is starting to backpedel.,No_Friend4042,2025-05-09T07:44:51,13
"80 percent is still going to bring a recession to the table... the slow traffic at ports is a sign of an economic downturn, not more money being saved.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-09T07:36:42,11
He’s desperately trying to back peddle his enormous fuck up and also hang the blame on Bessent.,SpottedDicknCustard,2025-05-09T07:56:55,10
"LOL - that's like saying, ""It won't be a Bajillion dollars, it will be a Gajillion dollars"". - He is just preparing to throw Bessent under the bus.",DraganTaveley,2025-05-09T08:13:05,4
"There doesn’t seem to be an actual number that Trump cares about. And China doesn’t seem to care a whole lot about offering one. Great job, Donald!",ranchoparksteve,2025-05-09T07:41:36,4
That’s still an insane level of tariff,Browns45750,2025-05-09T07:54:44,3
The buck stops... elsewhere.,steve_ample,2025-05-09T08:15:04,3
"Whatever progress Bessent pulls off, even if somehow equitable, Trump will trash it once the news breaks as a flex. Time and time again... MO.  On the outside, Trump is sounding reasonable. On the inside, he's crying because he can't get a direct face-to-face with Xi... who is now BBF with Putin and the rest of the world.",livelaughoral,2025-05-09T07:33:25,4
I'm hoping for something like agreeing to help fight fentanyl (which doesn't come from China) or three pandas.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-09T07:43:00,2
didnt bessent just say he doesnt choose the tariff rate? lol clowns,QuarkTheFerengi,2025-05-09T07:56:16,2
Then drop it to whatever it was before he fucked everything up holy christ.,Skraelings,2025-05-09T07:58:07,2
"He's knows he can't blame everything on Biden forever, so he needs to position some minions to throw under the bus. Bessent is the first of many.",Alu_sine,2025-05-09T08:10:57,2
The small businesses that recently paid the 145% tariff must be happy to see this.  His flip flopping on tariffs is making the situation exponentially worse.  His tariffs are dumb but it’s better to pick a rate & stick with it rather than increasing/decreasing based on who flattered him recently.,pollingquestion,2025-05-09T08:30:38,2
"Yeah, he knows he has to back down, but does not want to be seen as such, so he pawns it off to Bessent.",CurrentlyLucid,2025-05-09T12:39:12,2

Accepting all the blame for intentionally f**king up economy is a small tariff Bessent has to pay himself for the loyalty.,Plastic_Ad_1106,2025-05-09T07:41:07,1
Ah yes! The art of the deal in action.,ajpathecreature,2025-05-09T07:58:35,1
Bessent can do the funniest thing ever here,EPICANDY0131,2025-05-09T10:28:57,1
What a face-saving crock of shit.,SnooWoofers3339,2025-05-09T11:22:07,1
Bessent had a relatively *good* reputation in Wall Street before he joined Trump's administration from what I understand.   And then he threw it away to join a fascist clown show. You can't make it up.,spherocytes,2025-05-09T07:35:40,29
I think the “concession” here is the opening for them to be reduced or removed by Bassett.,Cypher_Blue,2025-05-09T07:39:45,19
Exactly right.,-Gramsci-,2025-05-09T10:29:58,1
"I think he means he wants it at 80%, but Bessent convinced him to cede control and it will be lower.",meTspysball,2025-05-09T09:31:09,6
"Yep, setting up his ‘it wasn’t my fault’ defense.",KCGeezer,2025-05-09T13:15:30,1
just goes to show that good reputation is worthless. the world is run by charlatans,ancash486,2025-05-09T08:19:50,7
He had a good reputation before this because he was relatively controversy free. Now he's radioactive.,Traditional-Level-96,2025-05-09T08:31:43,2
I mean a reputation with who though....,Slumunistmanifisto,2025-05-09T08:41:43,1
