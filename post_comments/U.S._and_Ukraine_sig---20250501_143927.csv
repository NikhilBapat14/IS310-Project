Extort.  Extort is the word you're wanting.   U.S. and Ukraine sign extortion minerals deal after months of horrible negotiations.,HonoredPeople,2025-05-01T15:25:06,2
Now Trump is going to obsess on the fact that Russia is squatting on one-third of his precious minerals. Should be interesting.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-01T14:46:14,1
This is a partnership like Jeff Dunham partners with his puppets. Except his puppets aren't aware they're being taken from behind.,jp_in_nj,2025-05-01T15:44:44,1
Trump will have some explaining to do to Putin.,jshultz5259,2025-05-01T14:44:14,0
Has there ever been a deal Trump made that he didn't break? Remember his big beautiful trade deal with Canada and Mexico?,Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-01T14:48:44,0
Just another deal that Trump will say is terrible in a few days.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-01T14:50:25,0
"So letâ€™s see, Elon Musk and Tesla just built a large lithium processing plant in Texas and it went in production in late 2024 and the deal includes lithium and graphite :-)",Catzendo,2025-05-01T15:03:16,0
"You are correct it is extortion.   However, I think in the current world climate its probably not an awful thing for ukraine short term. Russia clearly doesn't have a moral compass so sacrificing wealth for some protection may be worth it",Major-Counter-585,2025-05-01T15:42:52,3
"The deal would likely take a decade to even bare fruit...its symbolic, and allows Trump to support Ukr.  I'm glad USA is at least ""getting something"" in return.    If this was the Biden/Harris show; EU would still not be ramping up defense spending, buying Rus energy, loaning money to Ukr.  While the US would still be sending armaments and money to support the war with our only return being it is relatively cheap to disrupt Rus.",johnnybayarea,2025-05-02T01:18:47,1
Also a future US president might simply dissolve the deal.,putin_my_ass,2025-05-01T22:14:11,1
