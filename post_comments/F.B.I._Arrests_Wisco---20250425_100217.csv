"He doesn't have power to do a lot of things he's doing.     Let's be real: he tried to steal the 2020 election by sending fake electors to GOP state legislatures. When that failed, he tried to get Pence to not certify. When that failed, he tried to delay Congress' certification by encouraging his brown shirts to storm the capitol.  He's a seditionist.

"Yeah they totally shot themselves in the foot. My partner used to babysit her nieces 1-2 times a week for free while her brother and sister-in-law  went to doctor appointments, or took an extra shift at work. Then once me and my partner moved in together they suddenly “didn’t need help” and actually didn’t want us around the kids anymore (we had to spend thanksgiving and Christmas alone). I’m a teacher, I’m great with kids, but I’m too gay I guess. 🙄They’ve recently been flying in family members from Chile to help take care of the kids because they are so overwhelmed. At what point do these family members say “it’s too scary for me to travel to the US”. I feel so bad for them. I genuinely do. Their commitment to hate makes their life so hard.",cloudsunmoon,2025-04-26T09:37:04,2
"Yep, that's part of the family lore.  We're also Catholic so they were already hated over there anyway.  According to my aunt (our self-appointed historian), everyone with our surname was banished from the country.  She described it as ""everyone who was left"" throughout the country.  Our surname changed when they got here.  My aunt was young when she was told this but it inspired her collect as much info as she could, going back to when they got here in the 1600s.  She was probably one of the first users when Ancestry was created lol.  Then they got here, had a fuckton of kids and started farming, all the way through my generation.

"“Fascism” doesn’t have the military on its side. Fascism is an operating political philosophy that seeks to intimidate their opposition into submission. Which it often does by projecting more strength than it has. Which is why rule one of the article I just shared is literally “do not obey in advance. Most of the power of fascist governments is freely given.”  It’s an extremely well known and well researched sleight of hand trick authoritarians across the globe, across history have attempted, some successfully, some not.  You’re asking which fascists movements that have successfully pulled this trick off were toothless. The answer is they all were, until the moment they weren’t. And then most of the time they were again after a period of time. Mussolini was a joke until he intimidated the King of Italy into making him the Prime Minister. The King didn’t have to do that! He could have fought him and likely would have won. But instead he allowed himself to be cowed (and made what he thought was a strategic decision) into handing the reigns of government over. Then Mussolini was all powerful until 1943 when the military abandoned him. He was so toothless he was executed by a vigilante mob  That’s just one example, but that’s how it always happens. People believe the myth of strength, they capitulate thinking it will save them, but it doesn’t, it makes fascist stronger.   Accepting the erosion of norms, panicking, allowing yourself to be afraid are all forms of capitulation. They want you doing that because they know if you fought they’d probably lose.",AntoineDubinsky,2025-04-25T12:23:48,6

"Yea, I get that fascists primarily gain power by having it given to them, and that we shouldn't obey in advance. But I wouldn't say that makes them toothless. If they were toothless, they wouldn't be able to get to a position of power in the first place. They often use intimidation tactics, which wouldn't be very intimidating if they didn't have teeth.",Mavian23,2025-04-25T13:49:59,1
