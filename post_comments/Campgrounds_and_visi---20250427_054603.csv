- National Parks are a pure money maker and to save a few bucks they are losing 100x that amount...what else  could be the outcome of morons making moronic decisions. Its not like we did NOT KNOW what was going to happen. IT was clear as day in project 2025,decaturbob,2025-04-27T05:59:25,63

The point is to make the park private where the companies run while Trump gets paid for commission.,kupomu27,2025-04-27T07:32:50,8
Don’t tell the r/nationalparks mods this. They’ll ban you for “politics”.,Neither-Ordy,2025-04-27T07:47:12,9

Budget cuts to reduce federal income? Makes sense coming from a guy who bankrupted casinos.,Seeksp,2025-04-27T12:34:04,2

"The goal is to make the parks a steep cost which will require additional funding, which gives MAGA easy talking points. They’ll push that line for a while, showing low usage and low visitor counts. Someone will have the great idea to sell off leases to resource companies to destroy them for short term gains. Problem - Reaction - Solution is how they are going to privatize everything.",zffjk,2025-04-27T07:14:21,25

americans dont care about freedom anymore. they want to spread hatred. have control. and gain money.,saiyanscaris,2025-04-27T06:30:20,0
I’d agree with this. Posted a piece about public lands up for sale”sale” per Doug from DOI- 2 weeks before the info went public. Was told it was an “opinion” and that it was taken down and I’d be banned.,Esty80,2025-04-27T09:09:46,5
They've got a stickied post just for this. It seems like the mods would want to know. Maybe they just don't want the sub intended to promote and celebrate the parks to be clogged up with political posts. Did you get a ban and now are mad about it?,ToNoMoCo,2025-04-27T08:09:52,0
I also thought why not let Don Jr run a hunting endangered species charter for some extra coin?,Coconutrugby,2025-04-27T08:14:06,3
Yosemite Valley is a developer’s wet dream. Imagine the luxury hotels and mansions that could be built there.,Conscious-Coyote9839,2025-04-27T07:35:33,13
- National Parks generate 10x the money that is needed to operate....the intent is drive Park usage down and then declare we need to sell them,decaturbob,2025-04-28T08:16:22,2
- will be an auction fire fight and will happen sooner than later unless Congress steps in as so much of what trump is doing is beyond the constitutional limits of the executive. He does not have line item veto power or the ability to defund authorized spend as set by congress....the SCOTUS has a clear path to rulings as the demarcation line is pretty clear in the constitution. GOPers in congress are pussies right now but that will slowly change as they see the writing on the wall in 2026/2028 if we are not under martial law by then with no elections,decaturbob,2025-04-28T08:15:02,2
Trump is manufactured by rich people that ran up a bill they never planned to pay.,butnek,2025-04-27T08:20:34,3
Not all Americans.  Most of us are simply comfortable in our ignorance and complacency.  There’s also a lot who are actively frustrated and angry but feeling impotent and exhausted.,Caira_Ru,2025-04-27T14:56:02,1
"Ads on the faces of El Capitan and Half Dome, mansions on the Point Reyes Peninsula, high rises on the edge of the Grand Canyon- there’s so much *opportunity* to grow wealth! Just requires the last stages of selling out our national soul! /s",beard_lover,2025-04-27T10:23:59,0
