"trump is coming across like a fucking moron  wandering all over the place, talking about Obama's library, claiming US doesn't buy much from Canada, the border is just some dumb imaginary line someone drew, etc  just a fucking imbecile  and not including carney at all in the conversation  journalists are all fucking idiots, asking about Houthis when the Canadian prime minister is sitting there",ElPlywood,2025-05-06T11:38:23,25
Watching this live.  There has to be a point where his ramblings become unseemly to everyone.  He is free styling about whatever.  This is the best the republican party has to offer?,jpcapone,2025-05-06T11:37:13,16
"Trump is off his rocker, insane. Someone needs to step in and shut him the fuck up. The 25th Amendment is needed. Now!",SAJ-13,2025-05-06T11:40:52,12
"This is such an embarrassment. I know why Carney won’t just smack Trump down live but I wish he would just unload on him. Trump is so insulting and belittling. He believes he can complain and say how he wants to harm them economically and annex them, and that they should just roll over.",strandedinkansas,2025-05-06T11:41:39,9
"Carney choosing his words well calling Trump a ""Transformational President"" referencing the economy and border security.",ConsciousCoat8173,2025-05-06T11:40:17,7
"One of the key takeaways that I am starting to notice with the way Trump talks (and I am assuming how he gets his following) is the use of buzz words. Just take note next time of how many times he uses words like;  \- tremendous   \- billion   \- the best   \- the greatest  \- in history  \- strongest   All of these words remind me very much of just simple over compensation mixed with the inability to ACTUALLY know what is going on around him. It is so scary, his naiveness mixed with narcisstic capabilities at the strongest position in the world (arguably) is just a ticking time bomb",solarspade,2025-05-06T11:42:34,5
Dude. Someone needs to scoop him up... he's acting like my MAGA uncle after 4 gin and tonics on Thanksgiving.,AnteaterPositive6939,2025-05-06T11:46:44,4

"Watching this from outside of the USA, it's disgusting watching trump talk down on canada, calling our border an artificial line, claiming canada loves the USA. Never say never to becoming the 51st state ? Some how he believes we would be better off being the 51st state? Delusional. ",Bisexual-Bop-It,2025-05-06T13:48:00,4
Trump seems to have more respect for Carney than anybody I've seen him address. Low bar though.,ConsciousCoat8173,2025-05-06T11:38:32,3
I hope he brought his deck of cards and says thank you.,KingLenidas,2025-05-06T13:07:34,3
How many press conferences is this orange sociopath going to poison?     What kind of progress does he think will be made off camera after that rambling debacle?,Blueskyminer,2025-05-06T11:46:11,2
"Not sure what to expect from this meeting but it can easily be summarized as Trump's typical ramblings of the 51st state and Carney kissing his ass.   Certainly not the ""Elbows up"" movement Canada has been shouting for three months.",ReqHart,2025-05-06T17:22:43,1
"The funny thing is Carney only won the election because he promoted himself as the only one who could talk to trump , I knew he has no sway on anything just another liberal lier in power yet again",AssociationInner5959,2025-05-06T22:07:25,-1

Yeah. I don’t even know what he’s trying to say. Verging on completely incoherent.,Trick_East_3185,2025-05-06T11:37:56,12

We can crow all we want but the fact is none of wormy sycophants around him have the balls to use the 25th amendment,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-05-06T12:06:11,3
Because Carney doesn’t care Carney is and always will be for carney ,AssociationInner5959,2025-05-06T22:14:00,-1
"Carney basically said Trump gave Canada the impetus to decouple from the US, on trade, on the border, and on the military.  I'm so sorry our Canadian friends. We've done this to you and I know our relationship will never be the same. Only decades of Canada friendly presidents can even try to heal the damage, but moreover we need Canada friendly Congresses who will slap ANY president down for this kind of talk. It should be an impeachment and a conviction for the kind of rhetoric he has spewed forth about our neighbor.",Orzorn,2025-05-06T12:05:24,7

"ah yes, the ""*Duh shows you how insignifcant Canadá really is. Literally a brother was down syndrome*"" comment  always an incredible read",ElPlywood,2025-05-06T22:44:50,2
I feel embarrassed for us as a country.  The fact that people will continually support him is beyond comprehension.,jpcapone,2025-05-06T11:46:42,9
It's weird I stopped hearing anyone talking about presidential coherence and mental capacity after january,deekaydubya,2025-05-06T12:26:26,2
"No, he isn't. But Trump is unstable, and his words matter. His rant today continues to prove how unfit he is to hold office.",SAJ-13,2025-05-06T11:52:23,3
"I’m hoping that without the Trump cult of personality, support for MAGA might fizzle?  Also, I seriously doubt he’s going to sundown and announce impossible tariffs on social media in the middle of the night.",HearTheBluesACalling,2025-05-06T13:43:37,3
"The Vance memes have more personality than the man. So, it would be a significant downgrade for the GQP/MAGA crowd and definitely not an improvement for them or us.  He has less charisma than a soft potato, is a klutz and killed the Pope. He's also a shameless windbag politician that will say anything in the moment to benefit himself and conveniently forget having held the opposite view on every single subject.",Mustard_Gap,2025-05-06T11:59:20,2
"I think it would be a net benefit. There are a lot of imbeciles out there who only agree with the insane shit this admin is doing because Trump said it's good. Coming from anyone else, especially a soft and spineless little cretin like Vance, they'd have a much harder time swallowing the bullshit",Walter_Melon42,2025-05-06T12:08:24,2
"The guy who got uncomfortable at every “we will have them one day” comment doesn’t care? The guy who went “never, never, never” after Trump said “never say never” doesn’t care? You do realize he was calling us the owners of Canada when he said “I spoke to the owners of Canada, and it is not for sale.” Right?",Easy-Gear230,2025-05-07T07:47:32,2
I guess more so now more than before hahaha,solarspade,2025-05-06T11:56:49,2
"Also watched it live and that was an absolutely incoherent mess from the American President. He jumped from talking about woke construction of Obama's library, to a failed rail system, to forest fires in the span of seconds.   I think some of my favourite lines were:   - ""China only sells to the USA. They don't really make the dollars from any other countries""   - ""good mean hard tough construction workers, I love those construction workers, don't I Rubio""   - ""I don't know if we're going to be dealing with the USMCA"" after Carney had stated that's what needs to be discussed   - ""Raising Cane, you know he was incredible, we defeated Isis in three weeks""   - ""We don't do much business with Canada, they do more business with us.""",AlkaSelse,2025-05-06T11:57:45,2
"> ""We don't do much business with Canada, they do more business with us.""  Question: Google, who was the largest export market for the US last year  Answer: Canada was the largest export market for the United States. Following Canada, Mexico was the second largest export market, and China was third. These three countries accounted for a significant portion of U.S. exports in 2024, with Canada receiving 16.9% of total exports ($349.4 billion), Mexico receiving 16.2% ($334.0 billion), and China receiving 7% ($143.5 billion)  Jesus Murphy, the nonsense we have to put up with.",biscuitarse,2025-05-06T14:46:44,3

I also wasn't aware that business was a unilateral effort. Is it the one that's buying that's doing the business? Or is it the one that's selling?    Edit: this is sarcasm,AlkaSelse,2025-05-06T14:59:09,2

"The point is we buy more from America than any country in the world and we're 9 times smaller.   Not good enough? How about this to fix the trade deficit (or subsidization as your knucklehead president keeps referring to it.)   We stop selling America deep discounted crude that you refine which keeps American gas prices down and also allows you to refine your domestic oil to sell on the world market at a great profit and presto there's no more trade deficit.   You now have the trade surplus Trump wants, America gets reduced petroleum profits and more expensive gas prices.",biscuitarse,2025-05-06T16:30:20,3
"I'm Canadian, not American. And I probably should have added a /s to my previous comment.   Otherwise I totally agree with you! I'm eager to see Canada pivoting away from the USA and embracing new trading partners. Canada has already made strides in March to narrow that trade deficit, while expanding alternative exports. It's great to see.",AlkaSelse,2025-05-06T17:09:15,3
