Republicans see eye to eye on how to allow landlords and banks to raise fees and rents.,TintedApostle,2025-05-07T06:17:53,4
Its more important to get rid of right wing dems than maga at this point. Well never make any progress with corrupt dems holding us back.,KidFromDudley,2025-05-07T09:33:22,2
The Dems are useless and Americans are not smart enough to count to 3 so we can't get third-parties elected.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T06:22:17,-1
"No, we absolutely do, we just have DINO's in office.",NolChannel,2025-05-07T07:17:36,0
"Our system inevitably results in two parties, if Americans want more parties to be viable then we need to change  how we vote and allocate power.",thrawtes,2025-05-07T06:38:54,7
"There's nothing to stop us from electing as many parties as we want, especially in the House and Senate.  I agree the Presidency would probably come down to two parties.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T06:42:05,-1
"We use first pass the post voting and we don't have a parliamentary system. As a result, the house and Senate will also inevitably move towards two parties every single time. It's just part of the architecture of how the US government is currently structured, not merely a result of voter choice.",thrawtes,2025-05-07T06:49:21,3
The issue is by a third party entering the fray it will steal voters from the side that is closer to their idealogy inherently giving the other side a massive advantage.,AleroRatking,2025-05-07T07:26:13,2
Many states do not allow 3rd party candidates on the ballot. Other states require you to declare your party to vote in primaries. Its just a fucking mess that guarantees we stay trapped in a 2 party system.,Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-05-07T08:34:47,1
"The House is elected by local districts, same as a Westminster (parliamentry) system, and around the world many parliamentary systems are FPTP.   So I don't see why we can't have multiple parties in the House.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T07:03:48,3
_Many states do not allow 3rd party candidates on the ballot._     Really? I've never heard of this and I think it would violate several amendments. The Constitution is silent on the topic of political parties. What are some of the states you're thinking of?,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T09:30:55,2
"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-us-states-make-it-tough-third-parties-elections-2024-01-18/  Here's a pretty good write up that explains the difference and difficulties in each state. In some states, even if you can get on the ballot, you cant get into debates either. It really works against anyone trying to run against the status quo.",Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-05-07T11:11:47,1
