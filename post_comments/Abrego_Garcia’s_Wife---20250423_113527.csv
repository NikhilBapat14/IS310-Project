"You’re right that Garcia is a citizen of El Salvador and had been ordered deported by Trumps administration. He had a “withholding of removal” that protected him from being sent to El Salvador. But the issue isn’t whether he’s a citizen it’s how and why he was deported, and what happened after. He wasn’t deported under standard immigration procedure, he was sent directly to a foreign mega-prison known for torture and extrajudicial abuse, with no trial or due process, under a legally shaky justification (the Alien Enemies Act).  Even if someone is deported, we still have an obligation under U.S. and international law to ensure we’re not sending people to known torture conditions, especially without legal review. That’s a human rights issue, not a partisan one.  Also, Garcia’s case isn’t the most disturbing part. 238 Venezuelans, most with no criminal record in the U.S. or Venezuela, were also deported not to their home country, but to El Salvador, where they have no ties or legal protections. They’re now sitting in a foreign prison, reportedly being held indefinitely.  Trump defied a federal ruling that halted these deportations for the same reasons I stated.   The question isn’t just “why would we want someone back?” It is do we still believe in due process, human rights, and the rule of law even for non-citizens?

"here's that article wording-    * Hundreds of pizzas sent to judges amid threats * Salas’ son was murdered in 2020 at their home  Hundreds of pizzas have been delivered to the homes of judges and their adult children amid increasing threats to the judiciary, including some sent in the name of a New Jersey federal judge’s murdered son.  Judge Esther Salas of the District of New Jersey described the incidents during an online event on Tuesday aimed at addressing the worsening threat landscape for federal judges, who have been subject to impeachment efforts and viral threats after ruling against President Donald Trump’s actions.  Salas has spearheaded national efforts to improve security for judges since her son, Daniel Anderl, was murdered in 2020 at their home by an attorney who posed as a delivery man.  “Now Daniel’s name is being weaponized to bring fear to judges and their children,” she said during the event. “You’re saying to those judges, you want to end up like Judge Salas? You want to end up like Judge Salas’ son? These are alarming developments.”  Salas said in an interview that at least 10 pizzas have been sent to federal judges and their relatives, with her son’s name listed as the sender. These deliveries have been made across the US , including in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Los Angeles, she said.  Many of the judges who have received pizzas and other food deliveries were handling legal challenges to Trump administration actions, Salas said. However, at least one of the judges who recently received pizzas in her son’s name wasn’t, indicating the threats are part of a broader attack against the judiciary, Salas said.  Salas also said while initially, pizzas were being delivered under an option that requires the recipient to pay cash upon delivery, now senders are prepaying to have food sent to judges’ homes.  “What does that say to you in terms of the levels of threat that these people want people to get this, and they’re willing to even pay for it? What does that even say about the level of intent?” Salas said.  The pizza deliveries come as Trump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, have amplified criticism of federal judges on social media. House Republicans have also filed impeachment resolutions against multiple judges who’ve ruled against the administration.  Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in March that the public criticism “has resulted in increased threats to the lives of judges and their families.” Salas also said she’s been told there has been an increase in threats to judges since January.

Circuit, who is also president of the Federal Judges Association, [recounted](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/judge-describes-alarming-pizza-delivery-as-threats-increase) receiving an “alarming” unsolicited Domino’s pizza at her home on a podcast released earlier this month.",SnooChocolates1198,2025-04-23T13:34:33,319
