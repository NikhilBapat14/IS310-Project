"Democrats like this undercut the argument to vote for Democrats to oppose Republicans. It's the most short-sighted political idiocy I've ever seen.  Has the party been infiltrated, does leadership have no power, or is the plan to just agree with Trump?",Immediate_Cost2601,2025-04-28T21:37:13,75

[Michigan Democrat files articles of impeachment against Trump ](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5271810-michigan-democrat-trump-impeachment/)  Just watched Jessica Denson cover this.

Duckworth being in there is very disappointing. It‚Äôs time the Dems that bend the knee get primaried. Both houses. Even if it‚Äôs a Dem darling like duckworth,Abbey_Something,2025-04-29T05:16:51,4

"Perdue is particularly bad. If I were being generous I‚Äôd guess they think he‚Äôll be particularly bad and ineffective on China and he‚Äôll get through anyway so they want to stack Trump‚Äôs government with bad actors instead of fighting for better nominees.

Unless the democrats primary someone else (hint: they won‚Äôt) then your alternative will be a republican fascist. I‚Äôm not saying I support them or this but we have so little alternative.

They would first need to start the articles in the judiciary committee to get it to the floor for a vote. But that‚Äôs not happening so it‚Äôs dead in the water until next Congress.,freexanarchy,2025-04-28T23:18:20,14

The only one I would quarrel with there is Noem and perhaps Duffy.   You seem to think Democrats should just vote against Republican nominees on general principle. That‚Äôs not how the senate works. If they‚Äôre qualified they get a yes vote.   That‚Äôs the way it works when a Dem is president too.   https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nominations/Biden_cabinet.htm,Gr8daze,2025-04-29T10:20:42,1
