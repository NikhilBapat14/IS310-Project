"    None of our allies trust Trump or members of his Administration. They're not going to publicly announce that they're being more careful about what they share with us, but it is nearly certain they are sharing less than they used to.   The Signal thing will be old news in a matter of days. Trump will jingle the keys by doing something stupid and/or cruel, and like clockwork everyone's attention will shift   That members of the Administration are using Signal to get around open records law should be shocking, but this is my shocked face.

It’s his circus. There’s no real excuse here. The best you can get is “Well it’s not a big deal” but no one can deny it’s an error in procedure.  From an optics perspective, it reinforces the narrative that Trump is out to lunch and that the people he put in positions of power are idiots.

"If there was going to be outrage over it from his supporters, it would have happened already and it would have happened if soldiers died, which none did.   I honestly don't see this war plan leak getting much traction in the right wing media sphere and amongst Trump's supporters. If you go on Fox News's website right now, the War Plan leak only has one story on it and it's not even the top one. There's more outrage about Congresswoman Crockett making a handicapped joke about Gov Abbott than there is about this leak.   The right wing media sphere is going to downplay this as much as possible. If they can't do that, they'll move onto their usual DARVO playbook when their allies are embroiled in a scandal.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO   Hegseth started the Deny phase yesterday by downplaying it. I'm sure Fox and the rest of the Trump mouthpiece will swiftly move onto the Attack phase by discrediting Jeff Goldberg and calling him a leftist saboteur and ""not a real journalist"" because the Atlantic is leftist. Then they'll quickly move onto the Reverse phase and accuse him of leaking this information while they try and paint Hegseth and Waltz as the victim of a leftist smear job   So, in my opinion, if you were to compare this to Trump's scandal of keeping classified documents at Mar a Lago, it's the same level of outrage. For sane people, it is seen as a horrendous mismanagement of sensitive information and a massive security risk. For his supporters that are so far into the cult, it's seen as another leftist smear job and his media mouthpiece will do whatever they can to downplay it and reverse blame.",Tronn3000,2025-03-25T20:09:18,14
"Under Trump's administration, nothing will happen to the people who made this mistake. In fact, Trump never admits to making any mistakes. Trump would only punish someone if they disagree with him or don't worship him enough.  The mistake wasn't that a reporter was accidentally added to a classified high level meeting. The real mistake is that they were using a commercial product on their private phones. A low level officer would almost certainly be fired and probably prosecuted for doing that.  Today, we know that the CIA Director and DNI lied to the Senate. Or perhaps, to be charitable, they are so incompetent that  they weren't aware of what was said in the meeting they attended.  Trump's response? Call it a ""hoax"", attack the reporter, and blame Democrats and President Biden.

Nothing is going to end this administration outside of a 9/11 type attack and they covered it up or a economic melt down. That being said If i were concerned about this and they were my opposition I would do the following:  Hack their signal chats and record everyone of them on their personal phones. Maybe get an Allie to do it so i could use it to weaken the admin over time  I would also in 4 years time have them all arrested for violations of the Presidential Records Act and a few other charges about classified information.   The first thing i would do is put them in jail for a very very long time. Perp walk them and televise the entire hearings.

"A few differences this time.  * This leak is of info that is more specifically-defined than some nebulous ""Top Secret"" documents and this time we *know* (not just suspect) that someone got their hands on it that should not have.  * It involved an actual future mililtary action and not necessarily something from the past, and thus is more clear in how US lives could be at risk as a result.  * It was revealed by a reporter who brought some of the receipts but it's after the election and so is MUCH harder to claim things like ""It's the DoJ weaponized to punish Trump.""  * The original case *did* cause a huge uproar.  It has dimmed with time because the criminal case (remember?  He was criminally charged and almost certainly would have been convicted on at least some of the charges unless there was corruption in the decision) got continuously delayed first by lawyers and then by Judge Cannon who was clearly in the bag for Trump.  He had some chance of evading conviction on the Espionage Act charges, but the obstruction of justice charges were pretty clear and supported by evidence and in any fair trial he would easily be convicted.",ptwonline,2025-03-26T12:28:29,1
I think the smoking gun in this case is more obvious and more damning to senior officials.

"They both warrant scrutiny, however a vast number of people didn't turn out to vote so Trump was able to abscond with not facing justice on the documents (which I am positive he probably still has - and has added to, and most likely sold some to fund his campaign and lawyers).  With Signal, DOD has been very specific from the start that any communications app is not authorized and is (by DOD standards) not Secure. This is on top of the fact that Signal has an ""auto delete"" feature which circumvents (illegally) the PRA.  It is also bothersome that none of those involved seem to have used their secure phones (probably because an MDM -Mobile Device Management- blocked the install of an app like Signal) and instead used their private phones (also unauthorized and illegal) to discuss the Yemen strike.",TalosLasher,2025-03-26T14:13:09,1

Basically it's so bad, they we have no idea how bad it was because the people sent to retrieve the documents did not not have the clearance to even touch the documents physically. Total insanity that such a person was restored to fully presidential level security clearance...Just think about that for a second.  A State Department worker out of the embassy in Manila was caught leaving with one document back to her hotel room to continue working and that document was only Secret (not Top Secret or Top Secret SCI) and the document was only of a diplomatic nature NOT a military war planning document. She was criminally charged, convicted and spent a year in federal prison, in addition to losing her job and health insurance. She's now a convicted felon with zero chance of every being hired by anyone in that field. But Trump? He's in charge of the Signal group people.....   Also, for those who actually read the Mar A Largo documents court filings. This clown car show that happened with adding the journalist is par for the course with the Trump inner circle. At one point in th Mar A Largo case they moved the documents to hide them from Trump's own lawyer because they all knew there were conspicously marked TOP SECRET documents in those boxes and they had just submitted to the FBI legal declarations (lying to the FBI is Sec. 1001 felony) that said they had already turned everything over. The minute Trump's lawyer saw even one of these documents he'd have to immediately call the judge and have an FBI team on site. That would pretty much seal Trump's fate on the indictment and would trigger the crime frauds exception basically requiring Trump's own lawyer to turn him hin. So they did what any bunch of corrupt incompetents would do they allowed themselves to be recorded on the Mar A Largo video and server moving the boxes...the night before the attorney was scheduled to review the documents to certifiy via legal declaration that there were no further Top Secret documents on site.  When they later figured out that security cameras at Hotels is like an actual thing they called the IT director at Mar A Largo and asked him to delete the video (obstruction of justice) and he astutely said ""only if I have a request in writing from Trump Organization in New York"".  The Trump clown car guys said ""oh never don't worry about this"". Then they asked if he was working that weekend...LOL. You can't make shih up.

That was my country at its very best.   The rebuilding of Europe and Japan after the war was called ""The Marshall Plan"", and it was probably one of the smartest political moves in the history of humanity.

"For sure. There will be many many people trying to take his place.   But it's a cult of personality and there is no other Donald Trump and I think the Republican party is going to see another transformation.  People who attempt to fill Trump's shoes will get a similar response as DeSantis.    I think right now we're in the process of a political realignment.  This has happened numerous times throughout American society and we are overdue.  In the beginning new parties would replace the old ones, but around the Civil War the Democrat and Republican parties became permanent, and when the two-party system realigned, only the bones of the party stayed intact but the flesh within changed. The last time this happened was when LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act, and the process solidified during the Reagan revolution.     I think the reason Elon got involved so directly right now is because he (and others like Peter thiel) are trying to make the Republican Party into the tech bro libertarian party after trumpism dies.  Most young conservatives I know don't care about religion, drugs, etc. so realignment is necessary in order to make it  feasible in the long term.  Even with democratic backsliding, leadership still needs to have some legitimacy in the public eye if they want to successfully wield power without the threat of being overthrown somehow.    Elon even [said himself](https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/elon-musk-calls-section-of-maga-movement-contemptible-fools-who-must-be-removed-from-republican-party/) that the MAGA ""contrmiple fools"" need to go from that party about the H1B visa issue a few months back.
