"And the kicker? It will be the Dems will provide the votes to get this over the finish line....  Hear me out:  Currently the GOP tries to push this through reconciliation, but it will fail as there are too many factions not on board with parts of this plan. Moderate Blue state GOP-ers won't go for Medicaid cuts and want SALT caps limited. Fiscal conservatives want to cut more cost and won't go for lifting SALT caps.   Eventually a plan will be found that Trump will push for (he has no ideological stance and doesn't care about debt). But it will result in the GOP not being able to push this through reconciliation and will come to regular order.  But the Freedom Caucus won' tbe on board and will withhold their votes. So the GOP needs Dem votes to get it through... Now, the deal also contains lifting the debt ceiling and not doing so will cause the financial system to IMplode, as our system requires debt to grow.  The Dems will get weak in the knees and deliver the votes to get it through, while the fiscal conservatives can keep claiming they are just that.  At that point, it's 100% clear it's a uni party that hates America.",tommyjaspers,2025-05-02T11:35:57,4

"Hey Democrats, the only thing that Trump wants to spend money on are ICE and the military. Maybe you could run on spending money on universal healthcare instead of the bottomless pit of guns, bombs, and military contractors. Just a suggestion.",Simmery,2025-05-02T10:59:48,2

"Guns not food.  Empathy is a sin.  The rule of law only applies to the poor.  mAGa!  Democrats tried that.  Trump supporters don’t care about the health of others, not even their own grandkids.  They call it tough love.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-02T11:10:36,2
