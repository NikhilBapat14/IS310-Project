"[From the story](https://www.mysanantonio.com/business/article/layoffs-national-parks-20302258.php):   The threat of layoffs continues to loom for National Park Service employees, even after a judge ordered the agency and the Trump administration to reinstate the 1,000 [probationary workers fired](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/protest-san-antonio-missions-nps-20234387.php) in February 2025.   In the three months in office, the Trump administration pushed out nearly 13% of the NPS workforce, according to the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA). The cuts were led by billionaire Elon Musk and the new Department of Government Efficiency, a Trump administration effort to slash federal spending.  And, the layoffs aren't stopping. As first reported [by SFGate](https://www.sfgate.com/national-parks/article/national-park-employees-must-resubmit-resumes-20299248.php), park service employees were instructed late last week to submit their updated resumes by noon Tuesday and prepare for more staff reductions, according to an email shared with the news site.   From the email, Rita Moss, an associate director for workforce and inclusion at the park service, stated the department continues to evaluate workforce ""optimization opportunities.""  After the mass layoffs on Valentine's Day, a federal judge [ordered the NPS](https://www.mysanantonio.com/lifestyle/outdoors/article/national-park-layoffs-texas-20199206.php) to reinstate probationary employees fired, saying the terminations were illegal. However, even with the offer to reinstate, ANPR stated in a release that ""additional massive layoffs"" are on the horizon.",MySA_dot_com,2025-04-30T17:16:26,5
