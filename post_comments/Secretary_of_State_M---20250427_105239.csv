"”Of course they’re entitled to due process” while actively trying to erase it behind the scenes.  Rubio’s public defense of due process rings hollow when the administration is pushing for deportations without a hearing under the Alien Enemies Act, even involving U.S. citizens.  It’s a pattern: strongman rhetoric on TV, quiet erosion of rights in court. This isn’t about safety. It’s about speed, skipping judges, skipping lawyers, and skipping accountability. And once precedent is set, it rarely stops with just one group.",fulltrendypro,2025-04-27T10:54:53,506
