"He can certainly pause funding, but like many cuts he's made this will need confirmation from congress before the end of the fiscal year to hold up in court. Unlike other cuts he's made, these programs might be too popular to get the approval.",Literary_Addict,2025-05-02T09:18:16,59

"We shouldn’t be funding any media companies. None of them are “news” or real journalists, not even Fox.  They are all entertainment companies, sensationalizing titles to entice clicks so they can sell ad space for highest amount.  They write their articles not for truth, but to extract longest as possible “on page time” so they can sell ad space for even higher.",Zachmode,2025-05-01T22:08:58,326
That’s great and all but that’s going to last about 10 minutes without congressional action. It’s a layup legally no matter how much I want this to stick.,deadzip10,2025-05-01T23:58:31,161
"In its pledge drives since forever, our local NPR affiliate has insisted that it receives very little funding from the federal government and thus is dependent on listeners for funding. Lately, however, it has been billing itself as a ""service"" while decrying the threatened federal funding cut. So which is it, NPR?",Willow-girl,2025-05-02T06:25:57,69
I tried to listen to NPR a few times because I like to be informed on views on politics from the other party. But holy. Shit. It was impossible to listen to. I was listening to a segment on policing in America and one of the hosts had the audacity to say that if you're black and you choose to be a cop you're racist by occupation.

"I've listened to NPR on and off over a lot of years.  I noticed that the skew fluctuated depending on who was in office.  However, since Trump became president the first time, the lean to the left stayed that way.  Too bad for them.",Mehnard,2025-05-02T09:12:37,12

"I usually listen to my local NPR station on and off all day. This morning, I was astounded to hear them spend 30 seconds talking about our MLB team and later interview a Republican congressman, a diplomat who served during the first Trump administration, and a Democratic congresswoman who was in favor of ending the de minimus exemptions.

"Recent NPR article slant:  >Eighty years after the U.S. established the modern global order, foreign policy analysts wage nonstop debates about how it should be updated. The discussion often centers on whether the U.S. is still able and willing to shoulder the burden it has since World War II. But, Brands said, if the U.S. abandons that role, no other country can replace it.  Too Bad . . . Cry Harder . . .

"It really depends. Terry Gross interviewed people from all perspectives yesterday regarding the border, and she's generally fair. Ira Glass from This American Life ALWAYS has the other side represented, though he's from American Media. But the news? It's usually so skewed, often with mocking comments. I listened to a piece on budgeting after tariffs, and there was absolutely no discussion of the other POV. I feel like they have no clue or caring of what other people believe. I used to find NPR comforting, and now it just stresses me out. In woke language, NPR is not a ""safe space"" for me anymore.",lady__jane,2025-05-01T23:10:15,12

"> I am not seeing PBS as controversial  You must not be watching any PBSNews. Like at all. Yamiche Alcindor basically spent the entire first Trump administration picking a fight with every single administration member and when Trump started giving it back to her, she did a nonstop tour saying it was because he hates women and black people not that she's a lying sack of shit.   Their coverage is some of the most disingenuous, reddited moments out there for a news organization.
