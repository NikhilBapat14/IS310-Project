"So is the mother going to get in trouble? Fired? Arrested?   I've got basically zero doubt if some other kid stole his parents weapon and shot people, these same police officers/parents of this kid would arrest those parents for not securing their weapon.   Of all people, a police officer should know the importance of securing your firearms.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-04-18T07:41:12,100
"Imagine how devastating of news this would be to the mother, how humiliating it would be professionally, I hope that his family along with all the people injured are able to recover and heal. I cant imagine the pain and chaos all these people are feeling right now.     Edited from father ---> mother, misheard who's child it was, either way devastating for everyone involved.",Stephan_Balaur,2025-04-17T21:30:57,79

"I don't see why she should be arrested. He was not a child. He was a 22-year-old adult. No criminal record. From what I understand, a violent tendencies. Why would his mother lock up guns from an adult son? I know plenty people that don't lock up all of their firearms. They don't have children in the house. Unless she did something illegal, I don't know how she can get in trouble.",BossJackson222,2025-04-18T09:19:40,47
He could have just purchased one as an adult. I’m not saying just leave guns out and loaded everywhere but this is an entirely different situation than the school shooting in Georgia or Michigan where the parents were charged.,RonBach1102,2025-04-18T15:56:55,1

Downvoted for facts. What a shame.,TodaysSJW,2025-04-18T07:03:09,28
This is actually very true. I've seen countless liberals say he was a conservative etc. 100% false. But lying to them is like telling the truth nowadays lol.,BossJackson222,2025-04-18T09:20:17,-9
Yeah not sure what could have been done to prevent this,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-18T07:07:38,19
You're responsible to securing your gear! why tf is this so hard to understand? That shit needs to be locked up and the police officer should face jail time.,Academic-Tell4215,2025-04-21T08:43:12,7

Yeah I saw that too and apparently they want it to be domestic terrorism but how dare you mention what happens in Chicago every weekend.,BigHotdog2009,2025-04-18T17:50:48,-11
It’s just irrelevant. He could have been the biggest trump supporter ever and I would still denounce him.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-18T07:05:19,112

"She should face jail time if it's illegal for her to leave her guns out and not be locked up. If not, she shouldn't. I mean lol, how many people in America leave their guns in a drawer etc. if they don't have children in the house??? A lot of liberals don't own firearms. So they have no idea how things are handled when it comes to firearms. It's one thing to leave it in your car unattended. But to tell someone that you have to lock up your firearms in your own effing house with no kids, that's unconstitutional.",BossJackson222,2025-04-21T16:23:05,1
OK lol. My opinion still holds.,BossJackson222,2025-04-18T18:48:46,14
