"This is not the case at all. The Albanese ALP government was destined for re-election with history showing the likelihood of either a reduced majority or at worst a minority government. It showed none of the signs for a one term government.  The LNP opposition however conducted a very poor campaign with ill-considered and un-costed policies.   Its leader , Peter Dutton , was an extremely divisive character with a poor track record and non-existent salesmanship.  He unwisely considered this election to be one of the electorate punishing the government and that it could coast in without making policy commitments of any substance or costing.  They even met with a Trump election advisor and believed that Trump-Lite policies would increase their electoral appeal.   Some of their daft policies included cutting back or removing entirely work from home provisions and taxpayers funding a one trillion AUD nuclear power generation network.  Then , Trump declared his trade war and a host of other destabilising actions in the middle of a five week election.   This increased anxiety within the electorate and made the risk of protest votes unpalatable when compared with re-election of a stable and positive ALP government.  The ALP campaigned well while the LNP presented a schemozzle. Trump and his global destabilisation creating anxieties in the electorate was certainly a factor but is unquantifiable.  The ALP has now created history by its second term re-election with an increased majority.  Trump may have had some part to play in reinforcing the safety of incumbency but is certainly not the major factor in the success of the ALP in this election.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-03T22:56:11,19

"I'm happy Dutton lost, but Albanese isn't all sunshine and rainbows-he backed bills that allowed religious schools to discriminate based on orientation and identity, as an example. Also, this can't all be pinned on Trump-his opponent was an idiot, Albanese is decently intelligent campaign wise, and based on the polling error (he was decently underestimated) its possible Albanese was ahead all the way since the last election (though not by as much as he ended up being).",IvantheGreat66,2025-05-03T23:37:07,1

It’s true. The first thing he did was to rebuke one of his own followers at his victory speech who was bout to jeer the losing Trumpist dude - Albanese said “no - we treat people with respect here” .. he also opened his speech with the official acknowledgment of Australian indigenous peoples ties to the country. It was brilliant!,Unusual-Ear5013,2025-05-04T03:47:54,38
"It’s worth noting that the Australian electoral system generally rewards centrism and resists Trumpian attempts to “juice turnout”. Mandatory voting means there is no real turnout issues to worry about, and ranked-choice voting means disaffected voters on the fringes usually wind up supporting more mainstream candidates via preferences. Basically, trying to go hard-right like they did was a spectacularly stupid move.",ThoseOldScientists,2025-05-04T06:13:49,17

"The trick is focus on cost of living, and when they do culture war, say: 1. we're focused on COL, and 2. that's up to individuals not the government (such as attacks on Welcome to Country, land acknowledgement in US-speak).",leacorv,2025-05-04T13:13:47,1

"He (Dutton) also suggested the "" DOGE"" approach in cutting federal workers, targeted the trans community by suggesting he would remove DEI appointed staff, and suggested that Politian's should be judge, Jury and execution when it came to removing citizenships (creating second class citizens and taking a major step towards Authoritarian values). Even when he walked back his policies, he had shown that his values were aligned with Trump, for which Australians gave a collective middle finger response.",Adria_Orici,2025-05-03T23:42:37,36

"I strongly disagree the ALP was destined for re-election. Ignoring Albanese’s approval ratings being in the toilet for the last six months.   Looking at the last two years shows a few Western nations leaning to the Right, the US aside: just look at France and Germany- the Right wingers have either lost by a bee’s dick, or at least gained representation. The Reform UK (another Right wing) Party seems to be making headway in ol’ Blighty right now.   No need to discuss Canada’s sudden move from a certain Right wing victory back to the Left at the eleventh hour; we’ve all kept up with the news as to why.   Cost of living, housing unaffordability, the influx of migrants. All the ingredients were there for the Libs to exploit people’s fears to capitalise on. Pretty sure they did something along those lines during the Tampa incident back in 2001.  According to one ABC commentator (I forgot his name) pointed out 6 million voters placed minor Parties ahead of Labor but their preferences flowed to the ALP (mine included) even Liberal voters had their second choices flow to Labor.   There was nothing “destined” about this election result. An electorate near me lost a seat held by the Liberals for over 50 years.   The absolute belting the Libs have copped across the nation says more than “oh, let’s just the  incumbent government another go”   Since post World War II, the U.S. has played a massive role in our Culture and International Relations. Trump’s objectively irrational decisions in the last few months has impacted his Nation massively.   Our election results have shown we don’t want to risk this brand of “conservatism”, no matter how unlikely we would go to those extremes, the *possibility* we could bring people into power who ascribe to that brand is simply not for us.",el_moosemann,2025-05-04T13:16:57,2

"Sure I mentioned this but his campaign was already cooked and you cannot say that Trump was the major factor which won the election for Labor against all of the other factors I have mentioned.  The desperate , Trump-Lite approach did factor into a historic second term increased majority but not the victory and was not the only reason behind it and cannot be quantified.  Policies and their delivery with consistent and targeted messaging contrasted with the shambolic and misguided campaign by the LNP won this for the ALP. Albanese and Dutton were like chalk and cheese on the campaign .",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T04:03:29,5
"The ALP was not shaping up to be a one term government but was facing a reduced majority in its second term , as always the case in Australian political history , or at worst a minority government.   The debacle of the LNP campaign beginning with taxpayer funded trillion dollar nuclear power stations and an inability to promise retention or extension of Medicare funding was just a part of it.  Add to this  Dutton's flip flopping and reintroduction of culture wars when its policies failed to gain traction.   They had nothing to give but cuts and bullshit. Certainly the Get Australia Back On Track slogan echoes Make America Great Again and this helped to seal its fate.  Dutton could not sell a root in a brothel and the arrogant , lazy bastards thought that they could cruise in without any policy development. How wrong they were.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T20:07:16,1
"Yes, foolish and ineffectual but also devoid of policies and costings. It was certainly a factor in tipping it further out of contention but this election was essentially won and lost for a host of reasons. It is simplistic to just point at one factor.  Leading up to the launch of its weak policy launch it opened with a daft proposal to spend a trillion AUD of taxpayers money to fund a network of unpopular nuclear power generators. This was just one of their lead balloons, amongst many.  Analysis of this election will take time and will be the subject to much argument and discussion.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T08:07:45,2

"Of course Dutton tried to blame COL on him. But this failed for a few reasons:  1, Albo listed the things he's done or is going to do to fix COL: energy rebate, 20% student debt forgiveness, free TAFE (trade school), triple the bulk billing incentive (basically free doctor visits), tax cuts, cheaper medicine (reduced cap on prescription prices), cheaper childcare, etc. It's a long list that he checks off often.  2. He points out Dutton opposed all of these things, has no solutions (Dutton's top policy that was 90% of his focus was 25c off a litre of petrol for 1 year, something so small and lame no one can be enthused).  3. Another big part of the message against Dutton was his secret cuts. He had a $600B nuclear plan, which raises the question of what he would cut to pay for it. He promised to fire 41,000 federal workers, like DOGE, and flip-flop-flip-flop on the details of this like 5 times.",leacorv,2025-05-04T13:46:25,3
"As a voter all I can tell you is that I saw Dutton parrot every MAGA selling point.. saw Jacubta whatever get publicity with that MAGA hat and in the last week, see the footage of Trump saying that he sent someone over to help Dutton.

You are entitled to your opinion but without substantial research it is a hard claim to back up.  Sure it was a factor but not the main reason for the ALP success.   It was a combination of shithouse and badly sold policies from the LNP and comparatively attractive and well sold policies from the ALP.  It just added to the mistrust of the electorate and dislike of Dutton which sunk them. Demographics played a role in this with Dutton and his policies turning off women voters and the growing cohort of under 40' s.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T04:19:40,1
