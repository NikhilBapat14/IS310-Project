">Georgia State Representative Kacey Carpenter (R) wrote a letter on Arias-Cristobal's behalf to be read to the judge in her case. He told us  >""The reality is, the conversation has always been that we need to get hard criminals out of the country. Unfortunately, the people that aren't hard criminals are getting caught up in the wash.""  Why do people, especially Republicans, keep saying this? Trump was clear about what he was going to do. Saying this is a mistake or not what you voted for is a goddamn lie.",BryteInsight,2025-05-08T02:13:54,30

"ICE would much rather catch these low level ""offenders"" than go after the actually dangerous criminals they use as a justification for their existence. Up the quota - if they can't round up and deport convicted felons fire them. If they fudge the records to meet the quota and get caught - send them to CECOT.",cyberkine,2025-05-08T08:17:08,1
"When people have positions they know are indefensiby evil, they will often pretend to be stupid because they know that society treats morons better than they treat monsters.  So if you are a monster it is profitable to pretend to be an absolute fucking dumbass.",Deinosoar,2025-05-08T05:21:11,9
">Why do people, especially Republicans, keep saying this?  Because it was never about crime, or immigration, or any of the other bullshit that they parrot from conserva-cuck media that they drip-feed into their brains 24/7. They're just filling the air with words with that noize.  If any Republican actually cared about ""people coming into this country, we don't want them here"" (this is EXACTLY what they say, btw), then their plan wouldn't be to go after the undocumented people themselves. What Republicans would *ACTUALLY* be doing (again, if they actually cared about the issue...which they obviously don't) is they'd be going after the companies that are bringing them into the US, companies that are *HIRING THEM* by the hundreds to do the jobs the companies need done that Americans won't do.  But they'll never do that...funny, how they never talk about that part of the equation.  The real reason? Let's be honest,: it's pure racism, plain and simple.   They want to get as many non-white people out of the US as possible, and they're starting with the obvious transplants. Plus, what they enjoy about it (in a twisted way) is they get to act and look like they're hunting.  They've sucked so far at deporting the undocumented immigrants because they're *UNDOCUMENTED*. With no documents giving them information, they're just flying blind, picking up whoever they feel like pursuing. So far, if you ""look the part,"" and have the bad luck of running into them, they will literally take you off the street and detain you. Then the nightmare starts:  They ""arrest"" you, keep you in temporary housing, feed you, give you medical care (at this point, [they spend about $17,000](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5282847-trump-migrants-payment-self-deportation/) on every person they detain), skip due process (no court, no judge), then they ""remove"" you (put you on a plane to a concentration camp in El Salvador or Rwanda), and at that point, the prison is incentivized to keep you there (paid by the Trump admin)...and now you're stuck in a foreign country where no one in charge speaks your language, there's no legal recourse (as if the Trump admin even cares), and your life in the USA from just a few days ago is now gone. Surviving in one of the worst prisons in the world is your life now.",exophrine,2025-05-08T03:32:53,10
You expect them to go after actual dangerous criminals without a uniform and completely unidentified? That would be way less safe than ambushing students!,GlossyGecko,2025-05-08T09:52:29,3
"It’s certainly racism but I think it goes beyond that.  It’s sadism.  These people dont just want separate water fountains and deportations, they want pain.  They dont just want immigrants out of the country, they want immigrants to be violently punished for trying to emigrate in the first place.    It’s not just run of the mill racial superiority.  It’s finding joy in the suffering of others",Odd-Mode-4924,2025-05-08T04:35:41,9
"Sadism is an inherent part of racial superiority. The whole point of the social hierarchy is lording over your lessers, and there is no purer form of power than being able to hurt someone with impunity. Sadism and racism go hand in hand.",LordSiravant,2025-05-08T05:30:58,2
