That's the entirety of his existence. Something good happens? He takes credit. Something bad happens? He is not involved and it is all someone else's fault.,NeoMegaRyuMKII,2025-05-04T14:10:04,7

My child once blamed the cat for something he did. This feels about the same.,zffjk,2025-05-04T16:00:06,3
I still have trouble believing that the Orange “Two Toys” Turd was elected to be the President of the United States by real people in a free election. He acts like a toddler. How can he still have enough support in the Senate and Congress to allow him to ignore the constitution and the rule of law? The government wants to be fascist?,FicklePop3421,2025-05-04T16:18:52,3
people take this putz seriously....  smdh.,entrepenurious,2025-05-04T14:14:37,2
Is Trump  taking credit for the good parts and blaming Biden for anything bad surprising?  He has always put the blame on anyone else and claimed victory for anything that was the least bit good.,Nice-Lakes,2025-05-04T15:15:01,2
What are the good parts?,ariesbtch,2025-05-04T18:44:17,2
The sad part is that explanation is definitely going to work with the cult,Ok_Arachnid1089,2025-05-04T15:18:08,1

The reason people join his cult is that this is how they feel about the world too.,AdHopeful3801,2025-05-04T17:43:25,1
"Like he has done with everything his entire life: take all the credit for anything good, assign all the blame when it goes bad.",blackmobius,2025-05-04T17:48:35,1
Lmao he's not even trying to come up with a narrative anymore. He's just saying the quiet part out loud.,mob19151,2025-05-04T18:28:49,1
