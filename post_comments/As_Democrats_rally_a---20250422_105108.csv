"“We don’t think people will like that we support the Constitution.”  What the actual fuck, people? This is your excuse for pulling away from this case? Fuck off. Defend the god damned Constitution.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-22T10:55:11,38
"Well CNN, you could try and make it land.",KingThar,2025-04-22T10:54:23,24
"I can understand the concern. With the ignorance and lack of care swing voters have shown for things like the roles of the three branches of government and separation of powers, what are the odds they'll understand, let alone even care about, due process?  **But some things are worth fighting for no matter what.** Due process has to be one of them.",redpoemage,2025-04-22T10:55:35,13
"The article wants to say “Democrats worry that the public doesn’t give a fuck about immigrants and don’t want to bank on providing justice and equality for immigrants, because they might not win with that messaging, because the public doesn’t care about immigrants.”",Timely_Succotash_504,2025-04-22T10:56:56,12
"I want all Democrats that think this way to say it publicly, loud and proud. That way, we can more clearly know who to primary and who to rule out for 2028 and beyond.",PharmPhrenzy,2025-04-22T10:57:23,10
Due process vs outright undermining of the Federal government as a whole  Tough choice,TheFutureIsAFriend,2025-04-22T11:02:04,6
It doesn’t matter what voters think. It’s in the constitution.,Hayes4prez,2025-04-22T11:08:24,7
"""The job of a good message isn't to say what's popular. It's to make popular what needs to be said."" - Anat Shenker-Osorio, political strategist who doesn't feel the need to ask for anonymity to speak candidly.",prettyinacasket,2025-04-22T11:38:43,5
"> Matt Bennett, the co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank, said the Abrego Garcia case was a “tough and complicated cause” for Democrats to take up, but “[Trump] thumbing his nose at the court is a pretty safe place for Democrats to land politically.”   If even Thrid Way is on board, I'm not sure I care about the hot takes from two strategists and a man clearly trying to move rightward for his 2028 aspirations. CNN is trying to create division where it doesn't exist.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T11:11:46,4
As always democrats are letting MAGA control the message. ,Be-skeptical,2025-04-22T11:06:27,8

Imagine a world where journalists reported on a constitutional crisis with more gravitas and seriousness than real housewives of the closeted GOP.,withwhichwhat,2025-04-22T11:05:52,3
"It needs to be emphasized that there's not even much due diligence let alone due process. A lot of people just assume they're targeting ""bad hombres"" with pinpoint accuracy when in fact it's haphazard and hasty.",ChloeGranola,2025-04-22T11:37:04,3
Without due process there won’t be a vote.,notamermaidanymore,2025-04-22T12:11:05,2
"“but one democrat strategist says we should do nothing actually” who gives a shit. These fucking nerds couldn’t win an election even if they rigged it.   “hey you know all that populism shit that’s been working for Trump? You know how our adverseness to populism has made us lose election after election? yeah, we should keep doing that. I’m sure this time it’ll work! I read it in a book somewhere…”   shut the fuck up dork",ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T11:01:21,5
Due process is a god more powerful than democracy though.  I bet most people would support fascism as long as there is due process over a democracy without due process.  You've seen the comments on here.  The cult of due process is strong and I think will ultimately prevail over Trump.,dbag3o1,2025-04-22T10:54:11,3

"Meanwhile the three things that I have seen real debate and dissent about in any of the maga corners of the web I lurk are due process, tariffs, and Ukraine.  The way people actually leave MAGA is to get pushed out over an issue they care about that defies the orthodoxy. The harder those three issues are fought over, the more people MAGA will push out in their purity spiral.",[deleted],2025-04-22T12:04:42,1
Most voters aren't worried about things that don't affect them.   They care about the cost of living at the moment.  So maybe Democrats should run on that.,Holinyx,2025-04-22T11:00:53,-2
I mean the country did just vote for Trump. It's valid to believe voters don't care about civil liberties or democracy. Somehow they need to make the issue about how it could affect you as an individual on a selfish level.,Scarlettail,2025-04-22T11:11:59,-1
"It's the stupid economy stupid.  All the other stuff, while still ideologically important, isn't going to win the election, because clearly the electorate are at least 50% mindless rubes.",ResignedFate,2025-04-22T11:06:04,-4
"This!  And don't let people make it about just this one dude.  Right to due process is in our constitution, and taking that right from one person weakens it for everyone.",L_obsoleta,2025-04-22T12:54:29,1
"Yeah, maybe CNN can try to do what they ostensibly exist to do: inform and educate the public about important topical matters. Instead, they continue with this fucking ""Democrats in disarray"" framing that has served them so well over the past decade.",dietTAB,2025-04-22T10:57:57,16
A proper news agency doesn't try to fulfill a political agenda. Not that there are many proper news agencies left.,18212182,2025-04-22T10:58:45,-1
"A couple of ""strategists"" and Gavin Newsom.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T11:14:30,6
"Idk I've seen the FB posts. They actually dont care a bit about due process, though the maga population doesn't know anything or understand the fundamental problem with him not having the process. They're literally just repeating what leavitt says cuz they heard it on a tiktok or fb reel. It's actually really pathetic because they repeat it verbatim. The power of that lady's words on the idiots is really astounding (though not shocking).",kiramon53,2025-04-22T11:13:53,3
Upholding the constitution isn't ideology.. it's the law.,Grandpa_No,2025-04-22T11:13:29,7
"They were purchased by a conservative billionaire about a decade ago, so I guess that adds up.",Jaded-Lawfulness-835,2025-04-22T11:11:29,11
"Each and every news agency should be trying its hardest to maintain democracy and due process. The role of the press is not and has never been to blindly report facts - and even if it were, CNN has long since given up on being that sort of agency.",raddaya,2025-04-22T11:12:26,8
Correctly identifying that Constitutional rights are being violated is not a political agenda.,Cavane42,2025-04-22T11:17:35,8
I disagree.  A proper new agency can have any agenda it wants as long as it is clear it has it.,KingThar,2025-04-22T10:59:57,6
"How's that working out since the last election?  Not sure why the downvotes. It's pretty simple really. Now I see why the dems lost. Can't do politics properly.  Win the election first on the economy. Then quietly work on the social issues. It's the smart, and pragmatic thing to do.",ResignedFate,2025-04-22T19:27:06,1
"""Are the Democrats wrong for trying to protect and preserve due process? Some Americans think so, click to read more.""  Zero mention of Republicans enabling the erosion of our Constitutional bedrock, and zero mention that due process is in fact fundamental to all our rights.
