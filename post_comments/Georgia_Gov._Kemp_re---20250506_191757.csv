"Eeeehhh... there was that whole business with him being Secretary of State in charge of his own election, and the convenient erasure of voting machine data. He does seem slightly less evil than the MAGA clown show and wants to avoid being outright tainted by Trump & Co. and their chaos. This reads like Kemp is hedging his bets for the future  if/when MAGA crashes and burns, similar to what Sununu and Kim Reynolds are doing.",Ryllandaras,2025-05-06T20:45:55,4

"Any incumbent SoS in GA is going to be part of a team of people who oversee their own election. That doesn't make it nefarious or suspect. It's their law, you cannot hold that against him.  There was no illicit erasure of voting machine data. (You people, I swear). Data on the server was copied by the FBI shortly after the June 20 election and that the server was then returned to the Center for Elections Systems. Because the FBI concluded that the server had not been compromised, KSU officials then erased the data and prepared to use the server for other purposes (commoncause.org, Oct 27, 2017)",TheRealJenneJ,2025-05-09T05:32:39,0
"You know that Kemp's election happened in *2018*, right? You may want to look into voter suppression, his false claims about supposed hacks of voting machines 2 days before the election, etc.   (Also, *you* people, I swear.)",Ryllandaras,2025-05-09T10:01:17,1
