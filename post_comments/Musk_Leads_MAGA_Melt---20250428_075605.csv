Like, he could have been remembered by the history books of tomorrow as one of humanity’s greatest technological advancers of this century.  Instead, he’s let his ego and self importance overwhelm his more rational and logical thinking. He’s taken the approach of imposing his now warped beliefs and ideologies upon the greater population by power projection via wealth multiplier. He’ll be remembered as one of humanity’s worst people if he keeps on this path, assuming he hasn’t already earned that assessment.

"I think when Trump goes the fascist state will simply replace him with somebody else, for example Vance.      Again my operating thesis is that this is a fascist state.   The executive branch controls all of the security and military apparatus so at this point it doesn't really matter what the Republicans in Congress do.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T13:51:24,-2

"What general strike?    I don't understand why Reddit has this fetish with general strikes.   America has no tradition of effective general strikes. The countries that do, have strong labor unions because it's the labor unions that not only organize the general strikes but they also provide the strike fund so that people who live hand to mouth can afford to stay out of work for a week or more. None of those conditions exist here.        Without strong labor union membership, strong labor union leaders and a culture of general strikes you're not going to get them.   Expecting a general strike in the United States is like expecting a ski industry in Florida - the conditions don't exist.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T14:04:33,7

"Colonizing Mars isn't about advancing humanity either. If we have the ability to make another planet hospitable, we could have solved climate change on Earth and kept our current planet hospitable with way less investment and effort. But Musk would rather convince you to dream about colonizing Mars instead of confronting oil companies and tackling climate change on Earth.

Do you know what text/speech pattern recognition is? Did you know that bad actors are using LLMs to scan and aggregate data on social media sites to find and track opposition?  It *is* necessary if you don’t want everything you’ve ever written online aggregated in a folder with your name on it on someone’s desk.

"Why is it so hard for people to separate these two things, the way you just did? It's like abandoning your car because someone *tried* to steal it.  The car is still right there! It still drives!

"It took Hitler a full year to completely weaponize the German government after he became Chancellor.    Trump is only been at it for 100 days. I say by a year from now it will be fully fascist.    He's already arresting judges, starting investigations against liberal funding organizations like Act Blue, and he  forced the resignation of the head of 60 Minutes.    And of course he has deported countless people to a death camp in El Salvador without due process.    So I don't know why you say it's just Trump and not the state that's fascist.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T14:00:19,2

"I have a history degree, I don’t need the lessons.   You’re preemptively giving up hope. I will not. We have brilliant people that still have yet to capitulate to Trump. Donald Trump is incompetent, inconsistent, and chaotic. He will continue to lose in court.   He can break things really quick and it will take us time to recover. People will be hurt and impacted, but we are not yet a fascist state. Does that mean we don’t act? No, do everything you can.",Nate-dude,2025-04-28T14:09:18,9

"_He will continue to lose in court._   So what? His losses in court have no effect on him.    Since you have a history degree then give us something more concrete than ""hope"".    And explain why a regime that arrests judges, sends people off to death camps in other countries, snatches people off the street without a warrant, stops federal funding for universities that allow protests against its policies, and ignores courts is not fascist.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-28T14:18:36,5
