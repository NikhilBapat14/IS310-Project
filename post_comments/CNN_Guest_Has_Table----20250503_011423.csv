"I just wasted my time listening to a dumb anorectic bitch screaming that we should revoke human rights from all non-us citizens. She did this while entangled in a fancy dress, on a social media platform that reaches millions.   This is why I still cling to the hope of funding for scientific studies on high voltage fashion dresses. I still believe they could serve a purpose as surprise, public, correctional executions without due process in authoritarian societies.",Worksnotenuff,2025-05-03T01:55:15,35

"Probably too many syllables for rhetorical purposes — kidnapping is right, but it doesn't give the full picture. I feel like we might need a new word for this.",Kid_Serious,2025-05-03T14:21:07,2
