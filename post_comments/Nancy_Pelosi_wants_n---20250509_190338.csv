And I'd like him to speak out on insider trading and term limits too. But I don't see that happening.,Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-09T19:20:42,130
"That buzzard took an oath to uphold the law. And upholding the law means not allowing people to come here legally. If they do, they get deported.  Every human in the entire universe knows this. But all of a sudden liberals are trying to change that because Trump is an office.",BossJackson222,2025-05-09T20:23:16,23

Pelosi is excommunicated due to her love of killing babies. Sorry but her and Joe aren't Catholics.,chances906,2025-05-09T19:59:28,61
"Low-key funny that the dems are inflating this guy up because he criticized Trump. He is anti-LGBT, and they remain clueless. He also voted Republican on ballots without reps in the area.",Velocipot,2025-05-09T20:49:21,11
I thought Leftists were opposed to religion and religious figures.  Is that not the trendy thing anymore?,Sir_Nuttsak,2025-05-09T21:00:04,7

And I want the Pope to explain why the police were called to her house in San Francisco where they found her husband and another man in a state of undress.,SpecialFree25,2025-05-09T19:30:12,26
Send them to the Vatican.  See what he says about deporting then.,The__Relentless,2025-05-09T20:57:09,4

"You mean like how they wouldn't have been needed had the Democrats actually treated the border is if it were there? But that would have gone against the Democrats plans to have more illegal aliens allowed in the country voting so they would stay in power.  Yeah, I'd love to see him speak out on that. That, and insider trading.",DreadPirateGriswold,2025-05-09T22:09:48,3
Then I would like the Pope to tear down the walls around Vatican City.,krayhayft,2025-05-09T22:14:47,3
"This Pope already spoke out against deportations when he was a bishop. His opinion as Pope bears no more weight than his opinion as a Bishop. Speaking Ex Cathedra, his opinion is just his opinion like any other liberal’s bullshit opinion. We Catholics are free to ignore bullshit opinions no matter who they come from.",shamalonight,2025-05-09T21:46:35,2
"Her home Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone (a staunch conservative) wanted her to be excommunicated. However, she attended mass and received communion at the Vatican when she met with the progressive Pope Francis. Which is… unfortunate. She is not Catholic.",virgothesixth,2025-05-09T20:51:00,24
Was she really excommunicated?,MMcDeer,2025-05-09T20:45:04,3
There are different sins. Inherent sins are sins in themselves.   Insider trading isn't inherently a sin.  I am just explaining the reason behind not going after certain things. You may feel that financial crimes are the worst of the worst. The church keeps things simple. A simple man leading  simple life isn't burdened by inside trading.   Make sense?,chances906,2025-05-09T21:16:01,1
"I’m more interested in the astronomical wealth increase/insider trading. Something she should be held accountable for. So her husband is a freak, most of them are.",virgothesixth,2025-05-09T20:44:13,4

"The church is in a tough spot. They have always warned against the dangers of communism. The three Fatama girls where basically Mary warning against it.  The left in the US is modern communism. But the church has grown fearful of politics. They take a safe road to promote ""love"" and such. I say ""love"" because it is important and does matter.   The problem is they are ignoring the devil they always faught against right in front of them.",chances906,2025-05-09T21:11:53,6
"Officially? I don't know. The church has been clear. If you actively support abortion, you are excommunicated. Unfortunately, the church has been very soft (vocally) on the subject despite it being one of it's strongest stances.  The church is afraid to upset too many Catholics.   Canon law has been clear.   If you support abortion or support those who actively promote abortion, you are excommunicated. It's a mortal sin.",chances906,2025-05-09T20:50:27,13
"I was just saying if we're going to ask the pope for things like he's Santa, insider trading should be one of those things.   Make sense?",Uller85,2025-05-10T05:57:10,2
Not at all. Oh I see where you are coming from. Based off what crazy Pelosi was asking. I get it now. I intuitively disregard her bullshit so wasn't seeing that. Gotcha,chances906,2025-05-10T08:10:59,1
