"Young people tend to be more gullible, shocker. Y, Z, Boomers, Silent and so on were more gullible when they were young too.    Also I despise generational labels, I've met young people with their heads screwed on better than many older people and vice versa.",codifier,2025-05-04T13:12:14,76
What do you expect when a generation is taught how to take a test  and what to think rather than taught information and how to THINK,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T18:20:31,11
"In every single country where there's a right-wing party and a ""conservative"" party, polls show that zoomers vote for the former (such as AfD) and old people vote for the latter (such as CDU)  In every single anti-Trump rally that's been going on this year, the average age appears to be 60 and there's barely a zoomer in sight. Even liberals keep asking where all the young people are.  Which age range has the lowest net approval of Trump according to an April RCP poll? You guessed it, 70+.  No zoomerphobia!",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-04T11:28:10,47
The people who ran up the largest debt in the world are not the most gullible?,snusboi,2025-05-04T15:33:29,9
"First year Gen Z here, (1999) They are absolutely redeemable and learning. A lot of the young men I meet don’t buy into leftist nonsense at all thankfully.  The first years of Gen Z had a lot of Millenial leftist influence in the schools.  Just kinda interesting to watch. I’m sure it looks different elsewhere.",Chkrg,2025-05-04T12:06:52,30
Yep. Experiencing it first hand. Luckily my son also watches the guys who expose scammers but there’s still much to teach.,sWo97,2025-05-04T09:56:42,10
"I dunno.  Boomers probably buy into the manufactured narratives more.  When you look at media consumption habits it's been pretty consistent who the consumers of the ""fake news"" has been, and it's not the younger generations.  I'd bet there's also a bit of ""younger generation more gullible than their elders"" study funded by, if not also authored by, boomers, going on here.",Shadeylark,2025-05-05T06:16:14,2
"""Narrow online community"" but it's also the broad media. In 2015, GenZ was ages 3 to 18 so TDS was part of their development. What happens in 2029 when their media echo chambers are deprived of their Pope King?",Right_Archivist,2025-05-04T10:29:19,3

Learns about large-scale trend backed up by research.  Cites an isolated anecdotal experience in rebuttal.  You are the problem this study is referring to.,BestSeattle,2025-05-04T12:41:36,66
"Exactly my thoughts. Gen Z?   Who was falling for the Nigerian prince scams? Why do millennials and younger generations still get called for tech support? Who can't distinguish between real and photoshopped these days? Who is still giving their bank information to random callers?  There has to be some *very* niche definition  of ""media habits"" being considered here.  *""Gen Z is most gullible generation, when analyzing media habits (through Club Penguin).""*",Critical_Concert_689,2025-05-05T10:16:23,2
