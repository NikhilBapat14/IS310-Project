"Completely agree !  As well, I feel like we broke a bunch of things, like limiting the House to 435 seats.  The senate over and under-represents people as a feature, not a bug.  The House is supposed to be where equal representation occurs, but with limiting the seating, we have areas that are over or under represented in the House as well.   The other thing I think we broke was the Electoral College.  In the Federalist papers it describes the purpose of the Electoral College as the method to prevent someone of low-esteem from coming into power if the electorate is fooled into electing them.  The Electoral College was supposed to act as a circuit breaker in that event.  Now it's more or less a formality.   Of course Congress is supposed to limit the President as well.  If the courts find the administration, or the President in contempt, Congress is supposed to act with censure, or impeachment, as the courts can't directly enforce their orders.  I don't think the writers of the constitution foresaw a congress so under the power of any President.

Sure. I think people should be arrested for producing meth in their basement. I also think people with large quantities of meth should be arrested for intent to distribute regardless of whether they’ve sold it to anyone or not.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:35:52,1
So cooking meth has no victims?,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T10:43:42,1
Who’s the victim?,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:45:30,1
No one? So why do you want to arrest them?,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T10:48:08,1
Correct there is no innate victim from someone cooking meth in their basement.   There is no victim in prostitution either but that’s still illegal.   I could do this all day buddy. Tons of crimes where there is no readily identifiable victim.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:55:01,1
But you still didn't say why you want to arrest people for victimless crimes.,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T10:56:05,1
Would you mind getting to your point? I keep answering your questions then you change the goalpost and I answer it again and well it seems like you’re attempting to lead this somewhere. So why don’t you just get to the point please.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T10:58:31,1
"The most basic question is why do you want to arrest people for victimless ""crimes""? It makes no sense whatsoever. Existing as a human doesn't hurt anyone. Therefore just let people be.",GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T11:00:01,1
Right. So you don’t want people arrested who are driving 50mph over the speed limit as long as they don’t hit anyone.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T11:01:42,1
"Because that is highly dangerous. Adding a huge chunk of high speed metal to the equation kinda changes things. If immigrant babies weighed 1000kg and went 80kph, that would be different.",GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T11:06:04,1
So… where’s the victim though?,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T11:06:59,1
"The dead people killed high speed cars like 50k a year, not sure the real numberx but aprox",GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T11:08:47,1
That’s not what we’re talking about though. Driving 50mph over the speed limit when no one’s around and nobody gets hit is a crime without a victim. Do you disagree?,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T11:10:16,1
No. It carries a high risk. It's a choice to risk danger to yourself and others.,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T11:17:52,1
"So, you agree that risk is an important element to criminality even if there is no victim inherently?",Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T11:19:54,1
"Yeah, within reason.  Just existing does not reach that level.",GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T14:08:01,1
Nobody is being arrested for the victimless crime of merely existing buddy. Not in the US anyway.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T15:17:43,1
So an immigrant baby just exist in the US and you wouldn't consider them a guilty criminal. Do I have that right?,GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T15:19:31,1
An immigrant baby that is here legally sure. If they’re here illegally they should be deported just the same as their parents who brought them in. It’s really not a difficult concept to grasp.,Temporary_Warthog_73,2025-05-10T15:48:53,1
"So when you call people illegal immigrants you consider the baby a criminals too, right?",GrowFreeFood,2025-05-10T16:33:16,1
