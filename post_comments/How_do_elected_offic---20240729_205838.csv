"The answers may vary by state, so asking a local source might help;  generally speaking a fair number of legislators are lawyers, and lawyers are more often self-employed, and even when part of a firm lawyer work, like many other kinds of contract work, are well suited to only being part of the time.  There's also some work kinds that tend to be seasonal, which may fit depending on which months the legislature is active, such as tax work or construction.  Sometimes small business owners can do ok, if they can set it up to run well enoug hwithout them personally present for a couple months.  It's common for legislators to be fairly well off independently, or at least wlel off enough that it's feasible to do such a thing.  It's a known complaint about some states systems that the pay is inadequate.  Sometimes there's a list online of occupation distribution for specific legislatures.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-30T08:37:34,7
"As a New Yorker, let me introduce you to the magical income-enhancing world of graft. If you're any kind of discreet, and make sure the bosses get their taste, you'll get away with it.  Bonus: you get to keep a side piece in the capital, a nubile young junior staffer or summer intern, and there's a gentleman's agreement that what happens in the capital stays there.",knockatize,2024-07-30T19:15:13,2
"They just have to make it work. This is one of many reasons it's difficult for ""the average person"" to run for office. You get a lot of lawyers, consultants, business owners, real estate developers, etc.",[deleted],2024-07-31T05:41:07,1
"The original concept of the part time legislatures was that the legislature met in the winter - after the harvest, before the spring planting, when cities were not as miserable and life was otherwise slower.   It was assumed that only wealthy farmers / planters, or lawyers & doctors and merchants would be well educated enough and be able to afford the travel and lodgings needed.",RingAny1978,2024-08-01T09:34:46,1
"You see, the rich only want the rich making decisions.  They don't want a poor in there trying to raise minimum wage or push for fair taxation, or affordable housing that's actually affordable.  So they set it up to where you have to be wealthy enough to take massive amounts of time away from your job in order to make rules and regulations to keep the poors struggling that way they will keep showing up to underpaid jobs trying desperately to pay for their over priced housing and they won't have any time to breathe, let alone ay enough attention to politics to cause and real change.",NonyaFugginBidness,2024-08-02T19:58:16,1
"This is why the worn out argument about cutting politicians salaries doesn’t work.  I want them to ale decent money ,not get-rich money but good enough an average person can run and live on that money.",OH740DaddyDom,2024-08-04T20:06:15,1
I have the same questions you do. I also have thought about doing it. But it doesn’t seem financially feasible?,Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:17:58,1
That’s ironic. My business is one of the things preventing me from trying. It’d fall apart.,Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:18:33,1
yeah I'm trying to not be like that lol. it seems like basically you need to be independently wealthy at all to run for office??,pattyice420,2024-07-30T20:32:12,1
That explains a lot to me. I didn’t know these jobs paid so poorly until recently. $30K a year is ridiculous.,Playful1778,2024-08-09T20:19:19,1
