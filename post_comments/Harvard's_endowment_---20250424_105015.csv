"I don’t understand why the endowment per undergraduate student number is relevant, most of this money goes towards research.",Unlimited_Bread_Work,2025-04-24T11:57:34,383

"really?  I thought endowment funds were pretty much ever-growing funds that aren't being spent, but are long term investments.",Papa_Ganda,2025-04-24T12:01:21,62
No it doesn’t. The vast majority of funds for research are government funded grants. That’s why the endowment never goes down.,Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-24T12:30:12,25
"So either they aren't spending much on research or accruing more money than they spend. Either way, a fraction of that $7 million per student would be enough to offer free rides to everyone without legislating it and sending the check to the tax payers. You know, if Harvard wanted to.",Panzershrekt,2025-04-24T12:21:39,14
It's hundreds of thousands of dollars per student per year. Imagine each professor gets hundreds of thousabds of dollars from each student in their class per year to do research... you don't think that's huge? The point is to put it into perspective...,day25,2025-04-24T19:04:58,2
No it does not. Those funds are invested in stocks to grow their money even bigger,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-24T21:56:56,1

"Endowments are also earmarked, so they go out to a rich person and say “hey we need $10 million dollars for XYZ” and that money can do 2 things - be spent on XYZ or sit in an endowment fund and grow, allowing them to spend the growth on anything. It turns out getting money from the ultra wealthy is hard if you say “Do you mind giving us $10 million for a new hvac system, some urinal cakes, and general maintenance?” Rich people want their names on buildings - so most of the money can never be generally spent. I have family that does fund raising for another very well endowed (hehe) private university and this is a constant issue for them. They try and open general funds but it doesn’t attract the whales.",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-24T13:18:44,78

"A 1% ROI on $7,000,000 would easily pay for a student's tuition, and they can earn way more than that with government bonds.",GirlsWasteXp,2025-04-24T12:41:21,15
"Most ultra rich people don’t care about funding research (and if they do, they do it through their own foundation). The donors that Harvard gets want their names on things for legacy reasons, so buildings, scholarships, etc. most large endowment funds come from ultra rich donors donating tens or hundreds of millions for specific reasons, and the university cannot just use that money on something else.",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-24T13:23:20,13
"Endowments include both restricted and unrestricted funds. Per the [Harvard Financial Administration](https://finance.harvard.edu/endowment), unrestricted funds comprise about 20% of the endowment and can be used for any purpose. Bearing in mind that most funds are allocated to illiquid investments, that still comes to about $10.6 billion as of the most recent valuation ($53.4 billion), or $534 million in unrestricted investment income assuming 5% annual rate of return.  The problem with government grants is that universities use creative accounting to negotiate unreasonably high indirect cost rates and avoid accountability, so certain operating expenses that could be paid out of endowment distributions are instead borne at the taxpayer’s expense. That was the whole thing behind the NIH’s 15% cap on indirect cost rates earlier this year, which I think is still held up in the courts.  Edits for clarity.",zip117,2025-04-24T14:42:36,13
"If I was a really rich dude, I’d give money but in return want something random named after me, like the mainstream facility or the bathroom in the visitor’s center.",acreekofsoap,2025-04-24T21:27:55,1
"Back of the napkin at 4% ROI they could hire an individual staff member per undergrad student at an average cost of about $200,000 each and have a modest $550,000,000 left over for facilities and research annually.",Awkward-Ad-4911,2025-04-24T13:25:23,4
"Uh-huh, and adding yet another tranche to the fund that gets a donors name on something in exchange for the funds to provide free college would be difficult because?",Panzershrekt,2025-04-24T13:33:51,-2
"Yep, I’m not advocating for Harvard, just want people to be informed. It’s like when the left asks Elon to pay $500 billion in taxes because he has that as a net worth. Is he still unbelievably rich? Yes, but he can’t just snap his fingers and have $500 billion dollars in a savings account.",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-24T14:45:13,16
"I'll show a little more math.  Total number of students = 21,278  Total endowment = $7M * # of students = $150B  Annual tuition per student = $54K  Total annual student body tuition = $1.15B  If you invested the endowment at 4% interest, and only spent half of that (allowing for 2% growth), you could spend $3B. That pays for tuition for every student with $1.85B left over to spend on research or whatever every year.  Why are we giving them any money??",moashforbridgefour,2025-04-24T14:33:45,5
"I’m not an accountant or lawyer, maybe it would be that easy. My guess is that they could be doing more, but there’s a lot of legal hurdles they would have to jump through, and so far they have been hugely benefitting from the status quo. I do think we will start to see universities spend more of their own money as the federal teat dries up.   I was just pointing out that often times the endowment is not just a piggy bank they can use for whatever they want on a whim.   It’s like the left asking why Elon Musk can’t just donate 500 billion dollars to the government because net worth != cash in a savings account.",FlimsyInitiative2951,2025-04-24T13:40:37,9
"Exactly, and that’s just to give a sense of scale. I don’t want people to miss that crucial point about liquidity. While unrestricted funds may not be designated for a specific purpose, there are still restrictions on the spending of principal according to the terms set forth by the donor. Most endowment funds only allow spending of income generated from the original investment.",zip117,2025-04-24T14:59:49,5
