\>A BBC spokesperson tells The Telegraph that the news service uses “a range of eyewitness accounts from the Strip” since its journalists are not allowed to enter.  \>“These are not BBC members of staff or part of the BBC’s reporting team. We were not aware of the individuals’ social media activity prior to hearing from them on air. We are absolutely clear that there is no place for antisemitism on our services.”  Might I suggest a standard journalistic practice....that the BBC should refrain from reporting on events in Gaza unless it can rely on *credible* eye-witnesses.,Vessarionovich,2025-04-27T15:06:12,93
"BBC: <tries to save face after this blunder> ""Well, uh......we didn't know they were gonna say that. We uh.....we.....they aren't members of our staff. Yeah. We're blameless here. We aren't antisemitic at all.""",ITrCool,2025-04-27T17:23:19,32

"There is no carpet bombing.  Hamas could have saved many lives if they would have freed all hostages and move to their sponsors:Qatar and Turkey.  As for the post, it shows  genocidal intent to do October 7 again and again without regard of the impact on the civilians.  It also shows the BBC as a willing participant in this war on the wrong side.",Ask4MD,2025-04-27T16:19:22,49
Every time I see some moron use the term “carpet bombing” I know they can’t be taken seriously.,dottedoctet,2025-04-28T07:34:25,2

"It is not.  Learn the term -  carpet bombing was used by the Alies in Dresden, Tokyo in WWII.    Nothing like that was done by any western armies in the last 50 years.",Ask4MD,2025-04-27T18:11:28,24
They are leveling buildings and indiscriminately killing civilians. Close enough for me.,Highwiind-D4,2025-04-27T18:39:48,-15
People who resort to hyperbole to justify a position usually means they can't do it otherwise.,BestSeattle,2025-04-27T18:56:19,21
">Experts have described the Israeli military campaign in Gaza as one of the most destructive in recent history. By October 2024, Israel reported bombing 40,000 locations within the 360 km² Gaza Strip. Estimates indicate that over 70,000 tonnes of explosives were dropped, surpassing the combined bomb tonnage used on Dresden, Hamburg, and London during World War II. Satellite imagery revealed that approximately 69% of all buildings in Gaza were damaged or destroyed, leading scholars to term the destruction as ""domicide"" and ""urbicide,"" highlighting the deliberate devastation of urban environments  Yeah .. calling this level of destruction carpet bombing is totally hyberbole.",Highwiind-D4,2025-04-27T19:22:57,6

I doubt the children buried under rubble were connected to Hamas' terror attacks.,Highwiind-D4,2025-04-27T19:51:53,1
"Their parents were one way or the other.  You seem to forget the Israeli children that were killed, burned to death or kidnapped and killed by Hamas during their captivity like the Bibas family.  As I said, Hamas is to blame.  You want less civilians killed,  ask Hamas to release all hostages, lay down all their arms like Fatah did in 1982 and move to Qatar and Turkey (their bankrollers).",Ask4MD,2025-04-27T21:26:55,14
