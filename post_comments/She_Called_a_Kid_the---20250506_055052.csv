Disgusting. It is hard to believe people donating money for a person who stabbed an innocent 17 years old teenager to death‚Ä¶oh‚Ä¶wait a minute!,ConcentrateOptimal18,2025-05-06T06:28:58,112

"Sunday afternoon I went to the grocery store and was waiting in line to check out. The woman in front of me turned around and saw her son (I guess?) digging in her purse. She smacked him upside the head and yelled ""GET OUT MY SHIT N***A!""   If I had recorded it and put it online, I wonder if it would have generated as much outrage as this has.   Probably not, they were both black.",OmgIdkLmfao,2025-05-06T06:18:19,65
"So vandalism, murder, attempted murder/assassinations, destruction of property, actively calling for death and violence, riots, etc... that's all perfectly fine but they draw the line on name calling by some random person caught on camera???  I am against the use of the n word and all slurs but come on. Get real. The left is far, far worse and has absolutely no basis for pearl clutching.",chances906,2025-05-06T06:39:05,55

"Wow, in a moment of anger she said a bad word. That doesn't mean she deserves to be doxxed and have her life ruined.  Karmelo Anthony ended a teenager's life and has now raised over half a million dollars. I'd say that's a little worse.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-06T11:11:13,12
"While I don't agree with this...  Why is it okay for everyone to call me a cracker, whitebread, redneck, whitey, white trash and many more.   Plenty of whites find it just as hurtful as the word I can't type out or I will probably get a ban of some sort, at minimum probably censured somehow.  Where is the equality there.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-06T06:02:53,54
And now we have a go fund me set up for a cop killer I think they took it down because I couldn't find anything but now they have over 20k raised for justice for his son who was shot and killed by Cincinnati PD [article about the fathers go fund me and go fund me apologizing ](https://local12.com/news/local/gofundme-apologizes-apology-cincinnati-fop-fraternal-police-posts-postings-raising-raise-money-rodney-hinton-jr-accused-killing-deputy-charge-homicide-larry-henderson?fbclid=IwQ0xDSwKHCUBjbGNrAocJJWV4dG4DYWVtAjExAAEepayasRNJ4HckmP5iFqYXNfD7nwsC75YzHRxzx0Tw7RIV6xqL51OLv65X4cw_aem_1BSWkdb5EBl0D1rARXFbaA),Electrical_Iron_1161,2025-05-06T10:34:39,4
"Something is off with this one...I would love to know who is donating.  I'm a former resident of Rochester, so I'm in several groups for the city.  I essentially watched this story as it happened.  Shortly after the GiveSendGo was created, myself and others started reporting it.  None of my conservative friends think she is a hero.  It doesn't make sense.",Yahkin,2025-05-06T06:40:40,9

"The behavior of being fringe and expressing views different from mainstream society, has evolved into disconnected acts of perceived self superiority. In other words, the artsy creative and fringe type was cool, now it‚Äôs cool to call everyone a nazi and somehow be racist at the same time.",Cuse-Town,2025-05-06T06:47:07,2
"Not gonna lie here, what she did was wrong but the whole escapade is another example why social media was a mistake.    Calling someone any name is a offence but that's why we have the rule of law. Someone does something against the law, you call the cops and then let it go its way.    But now that's it's filmed and on the internet, bubbles will post emotional stuff that will constantly reinforce itself until people do fucked up stuff. That's not justice, that's a lynch mob. There is good reasons why we are not supposed to do that but the internet makes people even more vile than people behind the steeringwheel.",GamnlingSabre,2025-05-06T12:07:59,1
