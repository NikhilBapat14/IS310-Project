"Here are a few points that strike me as different:  * Polling methods have improved since 2016 (and because of it). * Hillary was a poor choice. Of the 20 candidates fielded by the major parties in the 2016 primaries (17 Republican, 3 Democratic), the nominees ended up being the two with the *lowest* net approval ratings. Harris' net approval is higher than Hillary's was. * Trump was an unknown quantity in 2016. Once he was known, he lost in 2020. * Hillary ran a poor campaign. Given the shortened timeframe, Harris has run a much better campaign.  * Trump's 2016 victory was marked by a lot of new Republican voter registration. People registered for the first time just to vote for him. Although this statistic isn't frequently cited, it's especially important, because people who take the time to register in a given cycle have a higher propensity to vote. New [Democratic voter registration has outpaced the Republicans](https://pentagroup.com/insight/state-snapshot-the-surge-in-newly-registered-voters) in the key swing states that will decide the election this year. * [Early voting in the three ""blue wall"" states](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/early-vote) favors registered Democrats. If Harris wins those states, she's highly likely to win the election.  None of this means Harris will win. Everyone needs to get out and vote. But if you're only looking for positive signs, those are some.",nosecohn,2024-10-31T15:23:34,101

In 2016 one could make a semi-believable argument that we should give Trump a chance and that he's not serious about the bad things he says.  You can't make that argument anymore. He lost in 2020 and the worst things he's done occured after he lost.,Alethean,2024-10-31T19:55:54,10

"Hilary didn’t campaign very well. She didn’t really garner enthusiasm. She spent more time catering to donors rather than voters. She also had the baggage of Bill Clinton and the whole emails thing.   Harris has run an amazing campaign and has garnered massive enthusiasm. A new poll came out saying democrats are more enthusiastic to vote now than they were for Obama (marginally higher enthusiasm but that still says a lot). In 2016 dem enthusiasm was pretty low. Hilary chose an irrelevant nobody VP, whereas Tim Walz is extremely favorable.   In 2016 Trump was a much stronger candidate. He disrupted the status quo and that’s what everyone loved about him. He has now been what everyone has talked about for a decade and is no longer disrupting the status quo. He was much sharper and cognitively intact. Now he’s senile and his cognitive decline is on full display. He has become more hateful and more extreme. He keep isolating key voting blocks. He was a terrible president and got voted out. He also staged an insurrection. There are many moderate republicans who hate Trump and will vote for Kamala this election.",[deleted],2024-10-31T14:13:51,59
"They've likely made adjustments to the polling. But talking heads and influencers on both sides are convinced their side is going to win, and they have smart sounding reasons as to why.

"Voter dislike for Hillary and her entitled attitude: the it's my turn message, the super delegates, her ill treatment of Bernie Sanders.

"The biggest issue was that most Clinton supporters thought it was a done deal that Clinton would win in a landslide, so many of them didn't show up at the polls.   Then there were a bunch of other issues, such as what James Comey announced just before the election.  Then there was trump asking Russia to find her emails literally asking a foreign nation to get involved with our elections.   There were a handful of other contributing factors that I don't remember right now. Perhaps others will point some of them out. But this time around we're trying to avoid some of those blunders.",TarnishedVictory,2024-10-31T13:38:41,10

"Here is the key difference as I see it.   Trump was a wild card in 2016. We all knew that he was an incompetent bully but policy wise, we had no idea what he would do. It was all speculation. I think most of us knew that he wouldn't do a good job at best and at worst be totally corrupt.   In 2024, we know what he is capable of so we really know what the stakes are.   In addition, I believe that most people thought that Trump was a joke candidate and that there was no way that Americans would take him seriously let alone vote for him. Everyone was certain Hillary was gonna win. In a perfect world she would have. Technically, she did as more people voted for her but that's not how our broken electoral college system works.   On paper, Hillary was absolutely a better candidate than Trump. While she was not perfect, she was definitely way more qualified for the job than Trump. Political elections are one of the few job interviews out there where skills don't matter. The President isn't chosen by a panel of policy experts. They are chosen by voters who may know nothing about government and economics and vote for weird reasons.   I digress. To answer your question, the key difference is that we now know what's at stake and we are taking Trump seriously",JayNotAtAll,2024-10-31T20:27:19,4
"I'd also like to point out that Hillary Clinton was often seen as just unlikeable and uncharismatic. No one liked her. There wasn't much enthusiasm for her, even for Democratic voters. I voted for her to keep Trump out of office, but I wasn't excited to do so.  There's, at the very least, a different energy around Kamala. I think more people like her and though she still has an air of ""politician that can speak for a very long time without saying anything"", she does a better job of at least seeming like a regular person.  I still disagree with many of Kamala's positions, but I felt excited to vote for her in a way that I wasn't with Clinton.",cparksrun,2024-10-31T14:13:42,5
"I look at it this way, Trump lost in 2020, he hasn't gotten any new voters, and a lot of GOP are saying they just can't vote for him again, if we have the same turnout as 2020 I just don't see how it's possible that he wins.",Inside-Palpitation25,2024-11-01T12:06:47,2

"in 2016 the polls soured shortly before the election, largely due to the comey letter saying the email case was still ongoing; turns out it was ongoing in a manner unrelated to Clinton. it deflated energy and allowed Trump to barely win  this time the october surprise appears to be the racist rally trump threw, and energy in the harris campaign is high.",roastbeeftacohat,2024-11-01T13:05:57,2
"The Democratic Party was much more unified in 2016. The glow of Obama was strong. There was a competative primary, but it did not seriously fracture the coalition anymore than others have. And the electability of Donald Trump was considered a joke to most outside of his base.  There is no Biden glow. If anything, the President has been a hinderance. Every decision in regards to this election has been damaging. This includes his decision to seek reelection at 80, his debate performance, and his month-long refusal to step down before succumbing to pressure from Pelosi & Co.   So without a needed primary, the Party moved forward with VP Harris. This is an important distinction from 2016. In 2016, there was a primary and a respected sitting Democratic President who could and would get on the campaign trail. In 2024, there was no primary and the sitting Democratic President is marginally, if that, involved in the Harris Campaign.  This has created a fissure. The Harris Campaign is stuck in the tricky position of both touting the accomplishments of the last 4 years, but also creating the illusion of change. The baggage of the incumbency, but without the appeal. A candidate that has not received the stamp of approval from voters outside of being selected for VP and Presidential Nominee in '20 and '24.  Of course, the environment is also completely different, in part because of the presence of Trump over the last 8 years.   The Republicans successfully manufactured a culture war over identity and immigration. Dobbs v. Jackson ended federal protection for abortion rights. Inflation has been generally high during the Biden Administration. Global conflicts have erupted with an intensity that wasn't present in 2016. Etc, etc.   Whatever happens, this is an unusual election. A President stepping down months before the vote is unprecedented. A Former (Felon) President seeking nonconsecutive terms has only happened twice before. A gender realignment this massive, including men of color, is strange. And the accusations of election fraud, treason, and the end of  democracy are recent developments. If a country can be in an existential crisis, we are in one right now.",[deleted],2024-11-02T19:47:09,2
"It's not Hillary Clinton  We have a good idea of what a Trump presidency is like   People didn't believe he would win, and thus didn't vote   That, and Trump has added a botched Covid response, economic decline, inciting an insurrection, and being a convicted felon to his resume, which doesn't look too great to a lot of people   Get out and vote, avoid the mistakes of 2016",montgomery2016,2024-11-04T10:01:59,2

"1: Harris hasn’t been the target of a solid decade of character assassination by the GOP before this election. She also isn’t taking the election for granted like Clinton did and is running a better campaign.  2: Since 2016 and since 2020, Trump has performed a coup attempt, which is quite possibly the most unpresidential act in US history. It’s unthinkable that he is still even remotely in the running, but there is a good chunk of independents that probably haven’t forgotten that he has proven himself to be literally a threat to democracy.",provocative_bear,2024-11-01T09:42:17,1

"Let me open with this... I DID NOT vote for Trump. I moved to Thailand and retired at 52 last year. I have no skin in the game... But I do watch the dumpster fire with great enthusiasm. I watch all the major networks from MSNBC to Fox and follow all the pundits on Youtube and X. I will not participate in election or ever pay a penny of taxes ever again. the only way I return to the united states is in a body bag.  Get ready to downvote me. if you want to live in an echo chamber, it is your right. I will give my straight opinion. Before I retired as a paramedic, I spent 8 years in the Army with tours in the Persian Gulf and also worked as a Drill Instructor. I dont candy coat $hit.  How are thing different?  1. This time you have a candidate that failed miserably in the 2020 primary. This time around she didnt even participate in a primary, they just made her the candidate. Tulsi Gabbard shares the video of her demolishing Kamala with every media outlet she can. She has difficulty answering questions. people are tired of hearing Unburden what has been and I was raised in a middle class family. She is not what I would consider a likeable candidate and does not inspire trust that she can take on world leaders in Russia, China or Iran. Maybe to the far left she is the second coming of Obama... not to the average blue collar American.  2. Hillary was secretary of state and a competent politician. Kamala had an approval rating of 8% as a senator and has a 45% rating now. Hilary also had over a decade of name recognition and was married to a president that was beloved by minority voters.  3. The RNC has run circles around the DNC as far as voter registration, vote harvesting, and ground game... This WAS ALWAYS the bread and butter for the democrats. The republican voter registration, early and mail in votes are as high as they have ever been.  4. Meanwhile 19,000 people were in madison square garden and roughly 75,000 out in the streets of NYC in full maga gear and only a handful of protesters. A few years ago, people were putting their health at risk by wearing a maga hat in public. Any dumb $hit Donald Trump might do or say really has no impact anymore. Trump is a brand, he is a supreme troll and a showman. The news outlets that couldnt understand the appeal of the McDonalds stunt or the Garbage truck, or the Joe Rogan podcast will never understand. Look at the amount of views of Kamala's two biggest podcasts with Charlemange tha god and club shay shay... Not even 3 million combined views and overwhelming bad dislike to like and hateful comments from black people. Donald trump and JD vance's rogan appearances have a combined 50 million views on youtube, 3 million combined likes and about 55k combined dislikes. Rally's in California and new jersey with over 100k in attendance wearing MAGA gear. T-pain dressed as Trump, wearing the gold Trump sneakers doing a funny Trump impression on Halloween. People in CALIFORNIA of all places are voting while wearing garbage bags.  5. Joe Biden has done Kamala no favors with his constant gaffes.  6. The migrant crimes against the nursing student, the 12 year old girl, and the 5 year old girl from a few days ago in new york. Was that Kamala's fault? Well a lot of voters think so regardless if it is factual or not. The republican have kept this news front and center. Democrats do have children they might be worried about just as much as republicans.  7. People that might have voted for climate change and abortion rights and social issues dont all have the luxury of affording these kind of policies. They cant pay rent, gas, child care, groceries and medical expenses. They are desperate and dont see the incumbent Vice President as an agent for change.  8. Minorities struggling to get by feel disrespected when migrants are given money, housing, food and jobs. Support among latinos and black men is almost unimaginable from where it was ten years ago.  9. Parents are concerned about title 19. They dont want their daughters to lose opportunites. They all watched the olympics. If they werent insulted by the opening ceremony, watching a man beat up a woman sure did the trick.  10. I think this is far worse than the 2016 election. The DNC see what is coming and can do nothing to stop it. The RNC has 900 lawyers, trained poll watchers, supreme court victories and an impressive ground game. Trump seizes every opportunity to pounce on a Joe Biden gaffe or a migrant crime and JD destroyed a woman on live TV when she said ""Only a handful of apartment complexes have been taken over by migrant gangs""",danbrooks3k,2024-11-04T01:22:53,1
"Hillary was in PA many times.  I saw her.  She was beyond qualified.  Unfortunately, her personality was a big issue for some.  Name recognition as well.  Trump was an unknown that spoke ignorant but relatable to the uneducated whites specifically.  And if you want to know how uneducated his electoral was/is just think of the hundreds of millions they have given him to pay his attorney fees for all his crimes.

The polling has it much closer than it did 2016. In 2016 too many didn't like Hillary & were sure that there was no way the Republican fool could win so they didn't bother to vote or wrote Bernie's name in which negated their ballot all together and enough Nazis & white supremacists showed up & voted to beat the few who did show up & vote for Hillary. In 2024 it looks like the same thing did happen not enough people who care showed up to vote for Harris & the Nazis & white supremacists showed up in full force to elect Trump again.,jacktownann,2024-11-06T04:14:38,1
"I'm someone who really didn't care who wins. Even at this time, it's possible there's an upset and Harris wins. I really don't care either way. I say that to express that my response is pretty non-partisan. It's just the way I see the facts.  The Democratic Party (elites) was dealt a hard hand and mis-played it. The hard hand was Joe Biden's deterioration. Had Joe been as spry as when he entered office, honestly a second term would have been a shoe-in. But, that first debate sealed it, the reality was he was done.  This is where the Democratic elites had to make a decision and they chose poorly. They went with Harris thinking that since she was already vice, had plenty of name recognition, was a woman, etc, they could ride to victory. The problem is,,, no one liked Harris to begin with. Everyone remembers that she wasn't elected, everyone remembers how she did in the primaries. Honestly, she wasn't even in the running.  The Democratic Party had a strategy to mitigate this, and on that front they did unbelievably well. They controlled most media, pushed articles about how strong a candidate she was, how wonderful a person, how smart and so-on. Harris received almost zero bad press. Her rallies were portrayed as having as much excitement as Obama, the polls were,,, let's say,, wrong because I don't have direct evidence of them being doctored (but let's use Occam's razor here).  The media refused to show any positive press for Trump.  So unfortunately, you did have the exact same setup for 2016.  You hit the nail on the head with your statement   ""*I'm mostly looking for reassurance in the differences of this election*""  So was everyone else on the left. This poison was so prevalent that everything you saw and read wasn't reality but wishful thinking and opinion, hopefulness, reassurance, presented as fact.  In the end, the reality is, the system is rigged. Neither Harris nor Trump are even as good as your average person as a candidate for president, but they're your choice, by design, you only get two.  The problem with the Democratic Party is they simply chose really poorly. Any of the other top-5 runners up in the primaries against Joe in 2020 probably would have been able to pull out a win. Yes, they'd require a lot more effort in some ways, but a lot less in other ways, and people would have actually wanted to see them as president. That's the main issue with Harris,, the primaries already proved that too few people actually wanted her as president.",L1Bert,2024-11-06T09:23:20,1

"For one, the ""democratic"" apointee Harris is grossly unqualified for office, she can't answer simple questions and her policy positions change depending on who she wants to pander to, her biggest and only claim is her stance on killing babies.

"1. Pelosi is telling Biden and Harris what to do. People are voting for the Party to be in charge since Harris isn't calling the shots but just the most convenient figurehead for the Party. Notice she just tells in generalities about the basic concepts and party platform principles. She's not really leading but following the narrative that the Party pushes collectively.   Clinton would have been in charge. But more people HATE her including within the same Party similar to HATE for Trump. That's why there are both Never Trumpers and Never Clinton.   Clinton is like the equivalent of Bush Jr in terms of people loving or hating because of their power in govt and public policy.  Harris is probably more like McCain where people are just voting for the Party not the person.  2. As for stakes that are different, Clinton would still have been tough on both the Border enforcement and the Middle East / Gaza as well as China issues.  Harris and Biden are weak and seem as weak and aren't respected as ""deterrent authority of law"" the same way Clinton, Bush and now Trump.  That's why Trump prevented more wars and had the least number of wars/military events than any other President. Peace through strength. Deterrance because Russia and China got his threats and understood he would follow up with full force. Obama and Biden are the negotiator type of leader but not deterrence by force type.  We need Democrats in positions for diplomacy such as VP and Peace and Justice outreach.   But we need strong Conservative ""Rule of Law"" leaders in charge of military, law enforcement and border security.   Biden Harris and Obama serve the public better as Internal Administration for domestic social issues like health care and education and job training, housing and prison reforms for restorative justice that help people personally. That's not the job of federal govt which is for External relations and duties .  The ideal would be to have elected Admin for both internal and external duties of govt so we elect both Democrats for social policies internally between people and within states by party for ""inclusion of diversity and individual choice"",  and Republicans for external duties of govt for deterrence and uniform ""rule of law.""  Trump allows for individuals to lead for themselves.   The Democrats push for collective policy and that's why they are seen as Socialists or Statists pushing policies through federal govt that really belongs to people and states to decide democratically not federal govt.",emilynghiem,2024-11-01T09:18:17,0

"As far as the points go, I think the first and third turned out to be either wrong or not particularly relevant. I stand by the second and fourth. The last two are factually correct, but didn't translate to a Harris victory.  My overall take is that this election *wasn't* that different from 2016, because Trump expanded his coalition in the exact same parts of the electorate he won that year. 2020 was the outlier, due to covid. He would have won in that year if he'd done a better job handling the pandemic.  I don't think OP's fears of Harris being rejected because she was a woman were proven correct. She lost because, after years of inflation and migration all over the world, it's a very difficult time for incumbents right now, and because the Trump campaign had a better understanding of the electorate than the Harris campaign (which she inherited from Biden) did. That latter part isn't too surprising, because they mismanaged Biden's campaign too, but there wasn't enough time to put an entirely new team together.  All three of those elections strike me as signals from the electorate that the government wasn't working for them, so they wanted to make a change.  A few people have replied to this comment with what seems like a post-election ""gotcha"" take. I could have deleted it, but I don't really feel the need to.

Then he dropped out and my enthusiasm skyrocketed because I no longer had to try and persuade myself to vote for a man who was obviously not fit for the job. And there was never a scenario where I vote for Trump.

Trump isn't running on inevitability, he's running on the system being corrupt and ready to cheat him out of a win; I doubt his supports honestly think he's unbeatable, only that he should be unbeatable because ""real america"" supports him.  there aren't parallels to the 08 and nearly identical 2016 clinton campaigns.",roastbeeftacohat,2024-11-01T13:16:06,6
"I voted for Hillary but the way she carried herself was at times irksome. Her surrogates, like Madeleine Albright, also didn't do her any favors.

"The electorate isn't stupid.   Voting against your interest is stupid. Wanting to dismantle the modern world order is stupid. Willingly ceding American hegemony to China and Russia is stupid. ""Investing"" in make-believe assets is stupid. Wishing ill and harm on your political opponent is stupid.  All of them are behaviors exhibited by Trump's base. So yeah, its not wrong to say they are stupid.",ttminh1997,2024-11-03T02:07:52,6
"Hi, strategically I may agree, but first off Trump, like Berlusconi for italians called them, Trump specifically republicans, the mental age of 12 (S. B) for the average Italian, and the most susceptible due to Fox News work of disinformation (Trump) when, I think on 1998 has been asked if he'd ever run for president, he brazenly responded this as the main reason he'd run for Reps than for Dems. Possibly before thinking such demeanor and drclaration would be easily found in the web. Both comfortable they'd be voted anyway due to the ""he's not talking about me"" effect as if declaring wanting to take advantage of ignorance isn't grave. Sure he insulted Dnc more than dem voters directly but he sure got awatly with doing the latter a lot and still gaining registered voters from dems themselves because they happen tp change their mind for whatever reason, be it concern trolling about sjw, wokes /buzzword of the month gone mad, cancel culture, gender, feminism, misandry, inflation etc. all of that enough to forget being insulted. Calling garbage a part of the electorate bad, calling Puertorico a garbage island, still winning enough of their vote despite all wishes them having a sussult of dignity to punish his arrogance, instead getting a red wave because "",but inflation, but illegal alien invasion""  even Arabs voting despite everything he said and done, rationalized somehow as not racist but somehow libs= smug and elitist, or nothing counts because of my single issue.  They don't care Trump himself insults them. I know the gist those are presidential and compassed and pc so they shouldn't let off insult but reach them and reassure them they are included though in different ways for different issues in that woke protection the right concern trolled them in feelinh they are left out, it's not the insult in itself, once those groups turned rep they think marameo! it doesn't apply to me anymore. They even think if so many minorities voted him it means his platform is inclusive and lots more fallacief to wade (Roe went with it) through and address.",Purple-Atmosphere-18,2024-11-07T06:04:46,1

"It's absolutely wild to me how many Republicans need explained to them what a presidential ticket is. They are so pissed Trump is no longer going up against Biden that they're desperately trying to create this fake rage from Democrats because ""we didn't vote for Harris."" Every single one of us voted for Harris. It's like they're just pretending to be stupid or something. Like they're pretending to think that you cast one vote for a presidential nominee and then a second vote for a vice presidential nominee when every single one of them knows you cast one vote for a presidential ticket that indicates you are supporting either of those people becoming president.
