I don't see any protests taking place in front of the White House. Or town halls.  Where's Jill Stein? Abbas Alawieh? Farah Khanh? Why is the Abandon Harris website gone?   They're missing because y'all got grifted. And you're lining up impressionable college kids to take the fall for you..,Grandpa_No,2025-04-23T17:28:08,0
"\> I don't see any protests taking place in front of the White House   There was a massive one in DC on April 5th lmao.   The Free-Palestine movement is still going strong. Maybe instead of being angry at the people who didn't vote for your pro-genocide candidate, you direct that energy at your party being pro-genocide? I thought the Democrats were supposed to be the anti-war party?",xxxIAmTheSenatexxx,2025-04-23T17:50:29,3
