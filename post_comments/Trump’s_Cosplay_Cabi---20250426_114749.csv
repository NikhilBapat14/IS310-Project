"Everything *about* Donald J. trump is kayfabe.  Why would his cast, er cabinet be any different?",allenahansen,2025-04-26T13:46:53,8
"Alternate source without paywall:  [https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-cosplay-cabinet-095527489.html](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-cosplay-cabinet-095527489.html)  ""In Donald Trump’s administration, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem rotates through various costumes—firefighting gear for drills with the United States Coast Guard, a cowboy hat and horse for a jaunt with Border Patrol agents in Texas, a bulletproof ICE vest for a dawn raid in New York City. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posts photos of himself doing snowy push-ups with U.S. troops in Poland and deadlifting with them in predawn Germany. And FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino spars with agents on the wrestling mats of Quantico.""  ""Trump, of course, may be the ultimate cosplayer. His quixotic political rise was fueled, in part, by Americans who knew him as a successful businessman, not through any of his actual business exploits (or bankruptcies), but through the high-flying mogul he played in their living room every Thursday night on *The Apprentice*.""  ""This week, *The New York Times* reported that, in addition to last month’s Signalgate, Hegseth had also shared detailed attack plans on [a second Signal group chat](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/20/us/politics/hegseth-yemen-attack-second-signal-chat.html) that included his wife, his brother, and his personal lawyer—again giving the impression of someone eager to brag about his important new job.""",ChiGuy6124,2025-04-26T11:50:03,5

"It's not a surprise, it's just so on point that this whole group of morons are playacting at being adults, and failing at even that low bar. I mean Trump is trolling us because that is what his base wants, maybe until it hurts their pocketbook and maybe forever, but these idiots don't even get the joke.",ChiGuy6124,2025-04-26T14:07:17,6
