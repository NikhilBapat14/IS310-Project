"As per [original article](https://nypost.com/2025/05/04/us-news/gay-porn-scandal-ensnaring-gop-nominee-splits-virginia-republicans/) 📰:  - Virginia Republicans are splintering over GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s call for the party’s lieutenant-governor nominee to step aside — after the hopeful was accused of posting gay porn on Tumblr.  Youngkin asked embattled candidate John Reid, a radio host in the Richmond area, to withdraw as the nominee upon learning of the images of naked men posted on an account using Reid’s Instagram handle last month.  Reid has denied the account is his and refused to step aside — leaving party faithful scrambling to unify about six months out from the state’s bellwether 2025 off-year election.  “That’s not my account,” Reid insisted after the scandal was unearthed by the Richmonder. “Anyone on the Internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people.  “I’m not going anywhere.”  Allies of Reid have accused Youngkin and his allies of targeting the candidate because of his sexuality. Reid is Virginia’s first openly gay statewide nominee.  But Youngkin has deemed the gay-porn scandal a “distraction” that will likely hurt the party if allowed to continue.  “One of the reasons why I called John last Friday morning was because these kinds of situations, where there is just a historical recognition that social media and explicit, explicit social media content like this is a distraction,” Youngkin told reporters last week.  “It’s a distraction for campaigns, and it’s a distraction from people paying attention to the most important issues, and here we are today talking about fentanyl and saving lives, and the distraction is present,” he said. “He and I had a very serious personal conversation.”  Several key Republicans in the state quickly hit back at the governor for being so quick to turn on Reid.  If this is how the Governor’s political operation wants to close out his term in Richmond — by tossing a grenade into the statewide Republican ticket — it’s truly a shame,” Arlington GOP Chair Matthew Hurt said in an email blast.   Virginia gubernatorial wannabe and current Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, a Republican, refrained from calling on Reid to step aside.  “John Reid is the Republican nominee for Lt. Governor. It is his race and his decision alone to move forward,” she said in a statement. “We all have our own race to run.”  Earle-Sears is locked in a very tough gubernatorial race against former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Dems’ pick in the state race. Youngkin cannot run for re-election this time around, as Virginia governors can’t serve two consecutive terms.  After days of controversy, Youngkin began striking a more conciliatory tone toward Reid and stressed that it would ultimately be the nominee’s decision about whether to stay in the race.  “We’ve got to get on with winning. This is John Reid’s decision. He is the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor,” Youngkin told reporters late last week. “He has clearly made up his mind that he’s going to stay in.  “I think the debate can stop there, ’cause that’s the answer. I have said that I will support the nominees and their ticket.”  Matt Moran, who has been a longtime top staffer for Youngkin and helmed the Spirit of Virginia PAC, denied accusations that he had been conspiring to pressure Reid out of the race.  “I’ve known John Reid for years and consider him a friend,” Moran said on X last week.  “Over the last nine days, I was actively supporting and assisting John as the Lt. Governor nominee of the Republican Party. Let me be clear, facts matter, and they will demonstrate the accusations against me are unfounded.”  Youngkin, who previously served as co-CEO of financial powerhouse The Carlyle Group, won the governor’s office in an upset 2021 election. He is the first Republican governor to win the top Virginia office since 2009.  That breakthrough has sparked presidential buzz for Youngkin and led to speculation that he could be a contender in the 2028 elections.  Meanwhile, he is hoping to preserve GOP gains in the state, which has generally hewed blue in the past two decades.  But Republicans are facing significant headwinds in Virginia heading into the off-year election. The state, alongside New Jersey, is generally seen as a barometer of the national mood that could foreshadow what will happen in the 2026 midterms.  Nestled next to Washington, DC, Virginia has been disproportionately battered by job cuts the Trump administration has made through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).  Virginia is home to about 145,000 federal workers, at least a fifth of whom reside just across the Potomac River from DC. To counter this, Youngkin has launched a website, virginiahasjobs.com, as well as a resource package for those unemployed thanks to the cuts.  The GOP is fearing that voter backlash against the Trump administration could be a boon for Virginia Democrats come November.",T_Shurt,2025-05-04T22:09:27,282

The explicit images The Richmonder viewed were reposts and did not show Reid himself. The Tumblr page appeared to have been taken down shortly after The Richmonder published this story. The posts had timestamps indicating they were published between 2018 and 2020.  So everyone can draw their own conclusions, but in my opinion the VA GOP want to push out Reid, so they can hand-pick their own candidate.",pierre_x10,2025-05-05T05:58:13,19

Winsome Earle Sears may be a black woman but she is NOT centrist. She’s a huge trump supporter and even had her team recently boasting that’s she’s more conservative than he is .,espgen,2025-05-05T07:49:23,6
"Centrist would not be the right term.  More so, right wing with an identity element to get certain voting groups that might normally not vote for them.  It is similar to how Clarence Thomas could become a Supreme Court justice despite a major scandal and being one of the youngest justices ever at the time because people did not want to vote against a black man.  Thomas is not centrist.  Nor is the lieutenant governor.",ADHD_Avenger,2025-05-05T11:26:10,1

"Youngkin won off the backs of the ""moms for liberty"" anti-trans people campaign.   VA has off elections for governors, so turnout is really the most important thing. And in 2021 the Biden voting people largely didn't vote, while conservatives were energized by their loss in 2020 and the aforementioned trans fear mongering.  This year is likely to be opposite, with Democrats energized after Trump's win and many Republicans soured by the first few months of Trump's presidency.",Indercarnive,2025-05-05T06:36:32,36
"Oh there is still conservative elements etc. They are running a conservative candidate in terms of issues (antiabortion, anti same sex marriage) for the governor candidate (Winsome-Sears the current lieutenant governor). They are unlikely to win. Beyond that Youngkin wins because in part the 1 term governor system means we had to elect a new governor. The previous democratic governor was decently popular but the candidate the democrats chose to run ran on a platform of Trump bad when Trump was no longer relevant (at that rime). The democratic campaign was really bad with no real focus on issues. Youngkin ran on fixing VA education (bs antiwoke arguments but it was focusing on a consistent message and issue) which allowed him to win.",cjh42,2025-05-05T07:41:42,3
"Youngkin ran as being more traditional and willing to defy Trump.  Because he came directly from the private sector, he could play that game (sound familiar?).  His main positions were minor tweaks in taxes to make groceries more affordable, and he was seen as a competent fiscal person due to his private sector work.  Once in office, it became exactly what you see.  Virginia governor is a unique position because restricted to one term, unless non-consecutive, so it is used as a jumping off point for people and often comes into play for a change in who is a realistic winner.",ADHD_Avenger,2025-05-05T11:17:36,2
"Yes I did indicate she was quite conservative on her issues. Sears is a right wing conservative. Anti gay marriage, anti abortion, etc...  it is a very odd bunch of republican candidates in VA given they have an anti same sex marriage candidate for governor with a gay lieutenant governor candidate.",cjh42,2025-05-05T07:51:40,1

"It's not even a good one!   Here I got it:  *ahem*  A sin is, by definition, a slight against God.  But we have no verifiable access to God nor any reliable way to know what He wants or considers an offense.  So while ""sin"" probably doesn't exist because God probably doesn't exist, even if I'm wrong it's irrelevant because we have no access to what is or isn't a ""sin"", which makes it a useless concept.    Everyone has their own opinions about what God loves or hates (which always seem to align with their own desires and insecurities, how odd..) but as far as anyone  _actually_ knows, _not_ having buttsex with your roommate's best friend could be a sin.  We have no idea what God is into.     /neckbeard",IJustLoggedInToSay-,2025-05-05T12:35:30,2
"I think we *kind* of got it, which is why VA was like one of the rare swing states that Harris won.  But yeah, the Democratic Party has long been fractured by this ratfucking by ""moderate Dems"" like the Third Way types, backed by the deep pockets of Wall Street, so your observation of the DNC very much feels like a matter of the Upton Sinclair quote ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.""",pierre_x10,2025-05-05T07:48:26,2

"He won’t be tossed out, but he can’t run for consecutive terms, so he’ll be out and a new governor voted in. I’m hoping Spanberger brings out the voters. I didn’t vote for Youngkin, but I live in an area that did, and he’s been more of a disappointing turd than expected by the milquetoast center-right independents who threw their votes his way.",projectedwinner,2025-05-05T06:48:07,16
"Youngkin is gone no matter what. VA has a weird rule where governors cannot run for sequential terms. He could be elected in 2029 though.  But yes, The Republican replacement is very unlikely to win. Both for the stuff I said earlier and that the Republicans here have really struggled to find a half decent candidate to run, and have struggled to find any real issue to run on either since the trans issue has largely died down to economic concerns.",Indercarnive,2025-05-05T06:44:39,3
