This makes me feel better. There is a way forward for us,Rosebunse,2025-05-07T14:49:57,47
"This is just another sign of MAGA having a low propensity voter problem.  Democrats are pretty good at persuading and mobilizing voters that pay attention to politics. It’s why 2022 went so well despite all the headwinds. If 2024 was a lower turnout election, Trump would have lost.",PersonNumber4423,2025-05-07T15:02:30,102
"Get bent MAGAts!  This reminds me of the Cincinnati mayoral election yesterday. Idk what the system is called but basically everyone is thrown in an election and the two who get the most votes go on to run for the mayor.   Anyway, last night one Democrat and two republicans ran (including Vance’s brother) and the incumbent Democrat run 83% of the TOTAL vote. Vance’s brother got 13% in second place. Just a total middle finger to the GOP",annaleigh13,2025-05-07T17:03:24,28

If Texas can’t keep them afloat then we have hope. Hoping GA reelects Jon in the Senate and the governorship goes blue. GA is the drunk uncle of the south trying damn hard to stay out of rehab.,NintendadSixtyFo,2025-05-07T18:01:55,16

Gratifying to see.  Democrats have ignored local elections in Texas for far too long.,Tx_Drewdad,2025-05-07T14:56:14,28
"So we won Texas, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia (not yet but soon cuz MTG) and got insane results in Florida.   And it's been 4 months",Existing-Ad3391,2025-05-07T17:06:15,19
"Have any of the defeated republicans tried to challenge the results yet? Seems to be the norm for them lately. This is really awesome, though!",iguessjustlauren,2025-05-07T17:47:48,8
"Good for them. Let's keep up the momentum. Maybe we can even flip the Senate seat in Texas in 2026, especially if Paxton primaries out Coryn ",PlatformStatus8749,2025-05-07T18:45:37,8

Texas is a national embarrassment.,Holiday-Book6635,2025-05-07T15:37:35,5
"While this is a very encouraging rejection of extremist politics, everyone should be careful about dancing on graves. I know if the tables were turned, people wouldn't likely be so thoughtful. But we're dealing with an ideology built on fear, this is not a rational platform. It is a viewpoint built on the idea of being ""erased"" in favor of ""others."" Mustn't stoke the fear further, this is an opportunity to lead by example. And that example should not be two middle fingers held high in their faces.   Trust me, I'd love to have that attitude, but the only way out of this mess is through engagement, not through alienation. Certain mindsets have no place in modern politics, and they will see themselves out, but only if we show them it doesn't have to be like that. I know this isn't a particularly popular opinion now-a-days, but I promise, the alternative is only further division and entrenched hatred. That should not be anyone's goal.",VengefulWalnut,2025-05-07T16:28:16,4

"It’s more that Trump motivates all voters to show up a lot more than anyone else. When he’s on the ballot, Republicans get a strong boost. When he’s not, Democrats are upset enough to show up for the midterms. It’s a big problem that neither party is able to mobilize people but a reality TV show star is.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T17:41:55,15

Lord that’s spot on. MTG and Hershel Walker. I’m from there and have no idea what they’re doing with themselves,ZeOzherVon,2025-05-08T02:36:07,2
">Georgia (not yet but soon cuz MTG)  I'd be careful counting chickens. We thought the same thing about Trump, ""he's too nutty and openly fascist to have a chance, he's too openly corrupt and criminal,"" twice, and he got in anyway.

"I don't disagree at all. It's been absolutely awful. But this chaotic adversarialism is what they want, and we should be careful not to feed into it. Educating people and cutting through the fear should be the goal. We're all in the ship together, and we all deserve for cooler heads to prevail at the end of it all. Entrenchment only leads to further resistance to the truth. We need to nuture the cracks we're seeing among the MAGA base. Gloating won't get us there.",VengefulWalnut,2025-05-07T18:06:16,0

Sorry that you’re in such a MAGA-friendly state dude. I’m in a deep-red county. I know how it feels (sort of),Dismal-Prior-6699,2025-05-08T06:19:46,1
I’m not talking about our fear. I’m talking about the culture of fear that drives everything MAGA does.,VengefulWalnut,2025-05-07T18:54:25,2
"A culture of pretend fear to cover up the hatred. There is no fear on MAGA's end, there is hatred and bigotry. That's what drives everything MAGA does, the desire to be able to step on people they don't like.  Anything else that MAGA claims is the reason including fear are lies designed to make their hatred look for palatable to other people.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-07T20:02:45,5
The hatred is born of fear. It is the most primal emotion. Simple psychology. That much I promise you. Get to the fear and you unravel the hatred.,VengefulWalnut,2025-05-07T20:10:59,1
