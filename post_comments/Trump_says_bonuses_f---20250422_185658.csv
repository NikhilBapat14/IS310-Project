"You have to not tank the economy for younger people to be interested in reproduction.   It's pretty hard to budget for starting a family when many people can't afford groceries, medications, or the astronomical prices of rent.   In America, an ambulance ride will bankrupt you, but sure, go ahead and give out those mom medals and ""bonuses"" that should help cover the cost of labor and delivery in a hospital.",Financial-Special766,2025-04-22T19:05:51,5

[https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/lebensborn-program](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/lebensborn-program)  The Nazi regime encouraged the birth of children deemed ‚Äúracially valuable‚Äù in order to increase Germany's ‚ÄúAryan‚Äù population. This campaign closely reflected the regime's racial ideology and theories of eugenics. The Lebensborn program was designed by the SS to increase Germany's declining birthrate.,williamgman,2025-04-22T19:02:27,6

Cheap medical care for children, Maternal and Paternal leave easy access to education, FREE SCHOOL LUNCHES!  But only Liberals think of the Children.

and when they get older you can garnish their salaries and savings to pay their student loans...  But really this entire approach is what you have when you refuse all the real working options because they go against your ideology.,TintedApostle,2025-04-22T19:04:29,1

My oldest is 21 and when she was born I had a $100 copay for the pregnancy and everything else was covered 100%. My last pregnancy was about 16k OOP between me and the baby. That and the cost of daycare are two of the primary reasons younger people are t having more kids.,Organic-Class-8537,2025-04-22T19:19:18,4
