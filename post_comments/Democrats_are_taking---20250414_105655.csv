I don’t know if it really has a shot but I think it’s a great idea. Let Republicans argue against their own power in public,blellowbabka,2025-04-14T17:45:54,3
The Republicans aren't ever going to allow that to pass.  They love being allowed to do whatever they want with impunity.,aaron_adams,2025-04-15T08:52:49,2

Is Liz Warren writing a letter to Elon or something? Dems have no power. They can't even reach their own base.,doctorsnowohno,2025-04-15T04:46:06,1

"Democrats should have had introduced at least twenty bills like this within a couple weeks into Trump's presidency designed to stop his and Musk's nonsense. Whether they could have passed or not is irrelevant, constantly striking at the Trump administration is what they should have been doing from day one of Trump's presidency, especially since he gave them ample grounds to do so during the first day, not to mention now.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-18T23:18:27,1

I think so too. Have at it!,mlineras,2025-04-14T15:36:30,3
#47’s check-up reports are always vague & suspicious. Right away his weight & height are always so obviously incorrect it’s laughable. But you can tell a lot more by seeing the list of drugs a person is being prescribed & filling. I want to see Trump’s list of prescriptions & he should have a publicly accessed tox screen results AWA the VP/executive branch & temporary appointments. Anyone who needs/wants a high security clearance.,OptimalRisk7508,2025-04-15T12:55:16,1
