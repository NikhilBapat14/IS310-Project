Third Reich vibes everywhere we turn in this country. We should all be very afraid.,hewasherealongtimeag,2025-04-23T20:52:48,43
"Oof at ""Are you Jewish"" separate from ""Do you practice Judaism"". Bit of a semantic nightmare. You can use less loaded ethnic descriptors like Ashkenazi or Sephardi. But that may be a bit too advanced for whatever brainless goon had the chutzpah to send this out.",handsoapdispenser,2025-04-23T20:56:25,36

"Not illegal for the EEOC to ask. This is part of the process of how they evaluate claims of systematic workplace discrimination. Or, it would be, in a normal administration.  In this one it’s probably some registry of liberal Jews for when RFK gets bored of rounding up the autistic.",not_productive1,2025-04-23T21:13:09,38

"The problem is that the brainless goons, which I agree they are, still have Google search.

"People say it because it's understood that way but ""Jewish"" isn't an ethnicity. I know people who are not of any traditional Jewish ethnicity but practice Judaism (by adoption or marriage usually). Would they not be considered Jewish?",handsoapdispenser,2025-04-23T21:29:43,-3
