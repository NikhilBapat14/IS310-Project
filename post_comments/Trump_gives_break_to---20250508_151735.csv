"There's a famous case [where Marvel tried to (and suceeded) in getting Mutants ruled as non-human in order to avoid tariffs](https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-152/).  Usually, Tariffs are complicated with specific definitions like you mentioned.  Trump has over-ruled those tariffs with his overly simplistic tariffs.  IMO, this is part of the reason why Trump is having so much difficulty making deals, Trade and tariffs are usually very complicated and very specific, Trump lacks the knowledge and ability to be so specific regarding trading deals and doesn't want to spend the day arguing or discussing small but important details.  But, since he's the president, and the dealmaker who makes the best deals, he's refusing to delegate those details to others, resulting in simplistic tariffs.",kia75,2025-05-08T16:46:01,1
