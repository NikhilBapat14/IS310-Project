If Hegseth does get fired I can't help thinking the next one will be just as bad or worse. I just can't imagine Trump hiring anyone competent.,Jasonicca,2025-04-25T02:50:54,8
"When history teachers are making bullet points to teach students how dumb Trump’s administration was, this guy will be the one they use to easily prove it.   Premeditated. He put in a freaking work order in order to circumvent the law. This DUI hire with zero qualifications, who has just fallen on his face over and over is a criminal and utterly incompetent. Yet Trump is too scared to fire him.  Anyone who defends this guy is just admitting how flaccid, weak and impotent Trump is. Any leader with any kind of strength would cut this doofus loose. But Trump knows how bad he will look finally admitting everyone was right about Hegseth.",TheDebateMatters,2025-04-25T01:49:27,6
"I think alcohol just might be hampering Heghog's decision making. That, or he's really fucking stupid. How long will they let him jeopardize our national security before he's given the boot? Who knows, maybe a foreign nation — one who could benefit from his ""mistakes"" — is giving him a financial incentive to make them. Just a thought.",invalidpassword,2025-04-25T01:25:13,6
