"Heres a link explaining it a bit further. According to them it was around 4 million adult Americans that were not allowed to vote but I believe the number is higher. (https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/locked-out-2024-four-million-denied-voting-rights-due-to-a-felony-conviction/) And keep on mind, on the popular vote, Trump was only 2 million ahead of Kamala. If these Americans were allowed to vote it likely would have changed everything.",[deleted],2025-04-24T21:38:59,12
