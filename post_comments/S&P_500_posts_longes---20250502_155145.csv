"Yeah because it just lost 20% of it's value, it seems weird to fucking cite this like some kind of impressive record when it's just climbing back out of a massive self-imposed hole the administration blew into it, I swear to fucking God that the gravest crimes against humanity are being committed right now are being committed by whoever writes these braindead fucking headlines.   Rich people *want* this to go up. Everyone wants this to go up. There's no *reason* this shouldn't be going up.   Because this isn't an actual crisis. The market plummted because one 80 year old fat fuck is literally ruining the entire world trade with his instransigence and incompetence.  This headline *somehow* manages to spin this like a win for Trump, like even the whisper he might talk to China is him setting a world record! When in fact, through his profound stupidity he tanked the market by double digit percentages, and now any sign that he might either come to his fucking sense or keel over from encrusted arteries makes investors desprately trying to push the value back up to where it was before htis fucking moron opened his mouth.  Editors know most readers online do not read much of an article, fi they read it at all. People get ""the vibe"" of the headline, and the vibes of many headlines inform the worldview of a great many people. A terrifying number of people.   And these editors writing shit like this, they *know* what they're doing. They know they're twisting words to form a vibe that isn't true to the reality of the facts. And they do it for clicks, or hoping to get an attaboy from the right-wing billionaire who bought your publication, they do it for all kinds of reasons.   But they know what they're doing and irresponsible shit like this is contributing to our rampant culutral and society rot.  They *know* the vibe of this makes it seem like Trump has made an accomplishment, when the reality is he's the most profoundly incompetent president we've ever had, and because our system is poorly designed and becasue he's stupid, he's subjecting the world to catastrophic economic turmoil and everyone is desprate for this to go away. Any gains the market makes is *in spite of how much damage he did to it*, and these people know that and they twist the words to do something else with it.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-02T15:53:31,53

This is the dumbest take.,accountabilitycounts,2025-05-02T16:17:08,6
LOL the media just loves to spin.  tRump folding like the bitch he is and the markets still being below what we enjoyed with Biden is not a win.  It's a huge loss.  We'd be approaching 50K at the rate Biden was growing the markets.,Richfor3,2025-05-02T16:45:13,6

Market has been trading sideways for weeks  It helps if you look at the numbers?,MittenCollyBulbasaur,2025-05-02T16:08:58,1
knowing things trump probably started to get lenient on things cause all his billionaire friends and corporations are starting to get hurt under the tariffs so china stays winning,saiyanscaris,2025-05-02T16:21:34,1
Yet we are still down from the highs.,individualine,2025-05-02T18:12:05,1
Yup. Literally all the gains from 2024 were wiped out by February 2025 and the market has been struggling to climb out of that hole.,AmrokMC,2025-05-02T16:05:23,11
