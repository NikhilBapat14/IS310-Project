Don't know whether this is good or bad. It reads as well intentioned but its very much a slippery slope as stated. Laws like this get utterly abused. Look at the UK for examples and look at the disgusting mess that is the sex offender registry which tars many people the sensible majority would never consider criminal,newcolours,2025-04-29T16:45:00,23
Oh yea…..this is much more important than releasing the names on Epsteins list…..I wonder why Congress was so overwhelming concerned with this rather than Epstein?  It does not take a presidential action for congress to demand this list released….ongoing investigation be damned….that’s just an excuse and has zero relevance if the individual/s are guilty or not.,tsoxiko,2025-04-29T21:10:36,11

"Like I said, I don't understand the allure of taking or having pictures taken.   That is also splitting hairs.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T10:03:33,1
"Yeah everyone is an individual with their own preferences ofcourse. I just wanted to say that not all revenge porn is full on sex tapes people might make of themselves, and that it's a bit of a broader subject covering various other material",Dutchtdk,2025-04-30T10:11:18,1
