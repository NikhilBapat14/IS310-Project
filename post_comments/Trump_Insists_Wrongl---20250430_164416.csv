I must have missed the memo where that disqualifies him from due process ,SilverhawkPX45,2025-04-30T16:45:57,14
Some Trump aid hands him these BS photos knowing full well Trump is amazingly gullible. They basically punk Trump on a daily basis.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-30T16:51:42,8

He'll never stop telling this lie,Happy_Weed,2025-04-30T16:44:52,6
Crazy that no one is bringing up his mental faculties based on this really as its very Biden dead eye stare into the void.,GrandSekiza,2025-04-30T16:55:32,5
"Wait does he think that the man has the literal word ""MS 13"" in computer text on his knuckles?",kingofcrosses,2025-04-30T17:44:15,5
His desperate appeal of “just say yes” is the ultimate sign of a mentally deranged narcissist.,bassplayerguy,2025-04-30T17:50:04,5
Ask your son about photoshop he understands the cyber.    You don't need to use a sharpie anymore.,LeatherChaise,2025-04-30T16:50:50,3
"I can't read the article, but did Trump look at the picture with obviously overlaid text over tattoos of things like a smiley face and a skull and think that the overlaid text was real?   I don't know if I should expect differently from the Sharpie-r in chief, though.",noage,2025-04-30T16:55:39,4

"Garcia didn’t have that tattoo before, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the guys in charge in El Salvador are having that exact tattoo added to his hand…",Dogitabonita,2025-05-01T06:47:15,0
"To be fair, he does have symbols that represent MS13.  To argue against that is simply intellectually dishonest.  Should he receive his day in Court:  Yes.  Does he have symbols representing MS13 tattooed on his knuckles: Yes",strangersadvice,2025-04-30T20:43:43,-2
"This is the part that the idiot MAGA base continually ignores or claim the Constitution doesn't protect ""illegals.""

"yes- watch the clip if you can - i saw it on a Bulwark podcast, and it even surprised me by how much he insisted on it, and wouldn't let the interviewer move on - he even said things like ""it says M S, right there"".",Fochlucan,2025-04-30T19:03:43,3
"not just think, he argued with the interviewer for a few minutes on it. interviewer wanted to ""agree to disagree"" but Trump wouldn't let it go and insisted that the overlaid text was real",ownagemobile,2025-04-30T17:42:19,6
"You know, this country is half way to getting sold for parts, wholesale Discount/ salvage price and his supporters, if he truly has any, actually think this stuff matters.",butnek,2025-04-30T16:58:08,2
Pretty sure he had the tattoo. It was mentioned very early in this story. Like the day after he was deported.,Happy_Weed,2025-05-01T07:50:54,0
Prove it,lili-of-the-valley-0,2025-05-01T20:10:14,1

"Yes, and I don't feel the need to explain why. You've given up defending your point so have just decided to flood the field with absolute nonsense",lili-of-the-valley-0,2025-05-01T21:38:07,1
"Surely the tattoos must mean something, right... what do they mean?  But my argument is that he should have his day in Court to explain (even though I think he's guilty).  Who am I to say without more evidence.",strangersadvice,2025-05-02T05:37:24,1
