Is it me or is the WSJ really turning on Trump? Pre Trump when I was a more moderate/ right  person. I used to like their stuff. Then the kissed the ring till J6. It seems like they have taken a bit of a stand. I find it refreshing. As they still have a lot of credibility with old school Republicans,Current_Animator7546,2025-05-01T23:00:05,14

"Carlos Uzcategui’s legal journey to the U.S. put the Venezuelan on a collision course with an ‘unprecedented’ deportation plan  On March 15, Carlos Uzcategui Vielma made a phone call from an immigration detention center in Texas to his partner, Gabriela Mora Méndez, at their home in Venezuela. He told her that he thought he would be deported home to Venezuela that day. This was good news—Carlos had been in immigration detention for more than three months. But Uzcategui never arrived. It wasn’t until Mora recognized Uzcategui in images circulating on social media, showing men with shaved heads surrounded by armed guards, that she realized he was being held in El Salvador’s maximum-security prison.   Uzcategui is one of more than 250 Venezuelan men the U.S. has sent to El Salvador to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or Cecot. The U.S. contends that the men are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. In this video, The Wall Street Journal investigated Uzcategui’s story, and found no criminal record or ties to any gang. Our review found no evidence to suggest he should be held in a foreign prison with no indication that he will ever be released. Uzcategui traveled to the U.S. via Colombia, crossing the Darién jungle in Panama as he made his way through Central America. In Mexico City, he applied for an appointment with the U.S. Border Patrol via the CBP One app for processing to cross the border. He waited in Mexico for nearly nine months until he entered the U.S. legally on the date of his appointment—at which point, friends and family say, he was immediately detained because of his tattoos. To examine his back story, we conducted interviews with family, friends and work supervisors in Venezuela and Mexico; verified his journey to the U.S. through emails, social-media posts and text messages; and searched databases in the U.S. and abroad for any criminal records. We verified records provided by his family that show he has no criminal record in Venezuela, and obtained documents from his immigration case, which show that he was deemed removable from the U.S. but made no mention of any gang or criminal allegations.  The deportations of hundreds of men without formal criminal convictions, or even charges, to a foreign prison is “unprecedented,” according to former Assistant Director for Homeland Security Investigations John Tobon, who helped lead the investigative strategy against Tren de Aragua and other gangs before he retired in January.  What brought these particular men to the prison, Tobon says, could amount to an extraordinary case of “wrong place, wrong time,” that traces back over months of a shifting political climate. This video maps the timing of Uzcategui’s journey alongside the growing perception of Tren de Aragua as a significant threat in the U.S. and the resurrection of an 18th-century law to target the gang’s members. Though Uzcategui couldn’t know it at the time, from the day he set out from Venezuela, he was on a collision course with a sweeping deportation plan that would land him in prison as an accused terrorist and criminal.",Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-01T22:57:41,6

"Murdoch personally detests Trump.  You wouldn't know that from Fox News.  But Fox is in the business of kissing Trump's backside and it wants to keep its viewers.   Times Radio in London, another Murdoch property, has constant takedowns of Trump.    Murdoch seems to prefer the GOP from the pre-Trump days.  He has gotten a lot of what he has wanted out of the Republicans.",I405CA,2025-05-01T23:53:52,2
"The Republican party is not what it used to be. Ronald Reagan gave amnesty to many undocumented migrants.   Trump is a modern day Hitler. Not as bad but still similar tactics to obtain supporters.   His policies make no sense and aren’t compatible. For example, undocumented migrants account for 40% of crop farm workers. Agricultural output is expected to decrease by up to 50% because of proposed mass deportation. Domestic labour in farm workers has sharply declined because they do not want to do this type of work, and domestic farm workers are aging.  Decreased agricultural output coupled with tarrifs will force the US to import basic commodities. Americans will pay the price. Most Americans are middle income. And other countries who export large amounts of agricultural products will benefit I.e NZ.   But hey - the US public chose this. And if Trump supporters had an IQ they would’ve known this would be the outcome.",stupidlysmart1,2025-05-02T21:53:21,1
