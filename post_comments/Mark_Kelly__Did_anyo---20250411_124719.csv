Did anyone in the Trump administration NOT profit off the market this week?  Seems like we should be seeking out those disgruntled employees to get them to turn on the boss who doesn’t share his insider trading info with them.,specqq,2025-04-11T13:37:41,14

Dems need to take control of Congress in 19 months so they can fully investigate Trump corruption and chaos. Capitol Hill Republicans are too afraid of Trump to fulfill their duties.   There are 21 House seats which Republicans won in 2024 by 9% or less. Not too early to start doing ground work in those districts.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-11T13:01:13,6

"If we start working now, we can make those Republicans more fearful of the general election than of potential MAGA primary challengers that Trump has threatened them with.   Make them more afraid of angry constituents than of Trump and they will reconsider their rubber stamping of Trump maladministration measures.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-11T13:44:27,2
