The secret sauce to El Salvador’s method is to be a 3rd world country with no pressure to have economic success.  Throw 10% of your male population in prison?   No problem. It’s not like you can become a 4th world country.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T22:39:46,12
"You're all kinds of messed up in the head if you think no due process and up to 20% of those being locked up while  innocent of any crimes(ES government estimate) is ""getting their shit together.""   All Bukele did was make deals with certain gangs to allow them to operate freely while cracking down on others.      https://english.elpais.com/international/2025-05-02/a-gang-leader-released-by-bukele-reveals-his-pacts-with-the-government-of-el-salvador.html",Blueskyways,2025-05-02T22:33:04,21
"First of all, and this isn't really my point anyways, but Bukele took credit for crime rates that were steadily declining before he even stepped into office.  These were noticeable drops too. In part due to some of the previous administration's policies, help from foreign governments, economic upturn and gang truces facilitated by the government.  But that's not as nearly as important as the fact that Bukele is a ruthless authoritarian whose mega prison experiment and election came with some major compromises.  I know this sort of thing probably doesn't mean anything to you, because as long as the president is preaching ""law and order,"" democracy isn't really a priority.  That being said, Bukele is known pretty infamously for using dictatorial measures to undernine the Democratic process.  Like Trump, he's been known to overstep his authority and entirely ignore legislative approval, sometimes even using the military to coerce and bully lawmakers.  He's used state of emergencies to consolidate power to punish dissidents.  Under his reign, many have been arrested and imprisoned without legal recourse or any evidence to support allegations.  He's been accused of countless human rights violations, and his prisons are dirty, disease ridden, deadly, extremely overcrowded and rife with abuse.  Like Trump, Bukele has attacked the press and journalists who are critical of his administration. He's been known to suppress dissenting voices and several media outlets have faced crackdowns and even cyber attacks that have been attributed to his administration.  These attacks and threats against the media have suited Bukele well, as he has better control over how and what information is disseminated to the public and international audiences.  Bukele has spent massive amounts of money on national security and prison infrastructure. The national debt has skyrocketed under his watch. And El Salvador cannot manage this for very long because it doesn't have the same advantages, monetary and fiscal policy options, economic scale and flexibility, access to capital markets, tax base, revenue streams, etc, that a country like the US has.  Despite his popularity, he is indeed a demagogue and authoritarian who has been able to run successfully on a ""law and order,"" populist platform. Crime is a wedge issue for El Salvadorans, couple this with the fact that he's been able to maintain a charismatic image with the public due in no small part to his abuse of power and control over the media, and you've got yourself a recipe for a portion of the general public that is either willing to overlook these things (for now), or is simply not politically informed.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-02T23:13:54,6

Why are they in prison?. You know america has a bad incarceration rate and yet we have many more people that belong behind bars.,Least-Complaint-6566,2025-05-02T22:43:53,-18
What makes our incarnation rate uniquely terrible is that we’ll give someone 10 years for smoking pot and then let people who steal billions in fraud pay minor fines.  Supposedly the FBI actually has loads of files on white supremacists organizations who have a stated goal of overthrowing the government and doesn’t even do anything because they’re scared it will be labeled as “political.”  Which also speaks to the state of our politics.,FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T22:49:29,10
Very precise details there.   “Many more people”  whom an unnamed Redditor thinks belong behind bars. What more do we need to ship folks to torture and death.  All the best countries are doing it. ,benecere,2025-05-02T22:57:09,10
>Supposedly the FBI actually has loads of files on white supremacists organizations who have a stated goal of overthrowing the government and doesn’t even do anything because they’re scared it will be labeled as “political.”  Well it’s also not illegal to want to do that.

"Your ideas on this issue are very dated. You know roughly 50 percent of murders in Chicago go unsolved? That is my hometown, most of these people are black. We had roughly 600 murders last year, most of which involved young black men. How do you feel about that? Do you not think we have many more people that should be incarcerated that are not?
