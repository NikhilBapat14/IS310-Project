Metallurgical coal is a different story, but purity must be high and volume required by steel industry isn’t exactly huge.",ShoemakerMicah,2025-04-30T16:20:35,2

He said he wants the new ""AI plant"" that is going to be built in South Texas to be powered by coal and steam (I just imagine a row of like, 300 old steam threshers lined up in a row, chugging along and spewing out black smoke),,,",justtakeapill,2025-04-30T17:47:57,1
