"There could be a strategy here to do what Putin did in Russia. Let a stooge act like he's got the reigns for 4 years (maybe while Trump is named Speaker), while working to solidify the changes to the constitution needed to allow him to serve further terms. Trump will probably not make it all the way to a 2032 run, which would then set up that stooge to maintain power for 3+ terms if they're popular enough.   The big problem is that no one in the MAGA party has the pull Trump has. No one. The 2024 primaries proved that this is a cult of personality. Look at the Nazi party in 1945. Hitler dies, his stooge takes over the party and almost immediately after flees. No one else is going to be able to keep this up. Trump knows that. And that's why, if they are planning to let someone acting more normal replace him temporarily, that's a last resort. There's plenty of avenues to get Trump into a third term, elected or unelected.   America needs to realize that his promise we'd never have to vote again was a threat to be taken seriously. And when the small percentage of people that could've been swayed to vote the other way have realized that, we then need to come to terms with the fact that probably 90%+ of his voters fully understood that this is what his presidency would be like. They are traitors, full stop. When this is over, they must not be ""forgiven""; it'll be time for a REAL Reconstruction.",alabasterskim,2025-05-04T10:46:27,1

"That‚Äôs one interpretation. On the other hand, ICE is ‚Äúdeporting‚Äù US citizens. This is him testing his control over state power, to do as he pleases.",Ready-Ad382,2025-05-04T15:02:17,0
"I just stated two ways for him to remain in power. One would be ""legal"" (as in, SCOTUS says so), and the other would allow him to shut down anyone who dissented to him holding that power (and then following a suit, eventually SCOTUS would say it's ""legal"").   Why are we arguing what's legal right now? If he holds onto power beyond 2028, it's illegal. What's legal isn't stopping him. Again, the people enforcing the laws are on his side.",alabasterskim,2025-05-04T12:50:26,1
Or it‚Äôs just him disregarding it in one situation. That‚Äôs a leap the size of the Grand Canyon to think that deportations without due process (awful and unconstitutional though it is) means that elections will not be held. Particularly when they‚Äôre held by the states. There is literally no mechanism for what you said will happen to happen.   It‚Äôs impossible.,ElderSmackJack,2025-05-04T15:45:36,1

"I don't see why we're arguing what's possible in the legal framework. He's doing illegal shit RIGHT NOW, threatening to arrest local and state officials because it's states' wrongs now, and in an interview today, when asked it the President has to uphold the constitution, he said ""I don't know""!",alabasterskim,2025-05-04T13:04:12,1
