"You joke but once the “take it down act” is done, that’s exactly what will happen. They’ll use it to remove what little truth we have left in media, and then they’ll start being physically and “judicially” aggressive with anyone who speaks the truth.  Amazon discussed showing the truth of tariffs and it was immediately proclaimed a “hostile” act.  You see the videos of unmarked, plain clothes ICE agents rounding up “illegals”. You see the judges being arrested. It doesn’t fucking stop there. It NEVER fucking stops there.  We’re beyond the point where clever signs on the side of the streets on our days off are going to solve this problem. America as we knew it is gone. A revolution is currently happening. They’ve said as much. But everyday Americans don’t seem to give a fuck enough to fight back.  And democrats aren’t the answer. They voted unanimously for “Take It Down” despite the clear indication it would be used to suppress free speech. PAC’s gobbling up 50501 for fear of what a grassroots movement means for their establishment. They fucked over Bernie for Hilary. Pushed Kamala last minute, without primaries. If those mother fuckers aren’t a false choice, I don’t know what is. Only a tiny, tiny handful of them are actually for the people. The rest are just as bought and paid for as conservatives. They’re like the team the globe trotters plays against.  But eventually, status, wealth, citizenship…none of it will matter. Eventually, everyone becomes the enemy. That’s how fascism works. “First they came for…” I guarantee you the Trump administration cranks up the arrests and violence going forward. They have zero plans of allowing democracy to come up for air. They can’t.

"> Amazon discussed showing the truth of tariffs and it was immediately proclaimed a “hostile” act.  Ironically, showing the tariffs does exactly what the tariffs are supposed to do: it is supposed to discourage consumption of foreign products and nothing does that faster than showing the tax outright. Why pay $5 in taxes for nothing when you could just spend a few dollars more and buy the better quality American-made version?  But no, I think they realize if they show the tariffs, they'll be showing the tariffs for a long time, because they don't intend to bring manufacturing back. They want to tax consumption so they don't need to tax the wealthy, and you can't do that if the products aren't being taxed.",Dzugavili,2025-04-29T16:10:10,11

"That's my point- they did try that with Nixon. Watergate wasn't the first one. Nixon was kinda a horrible president in his own right. Eventually, a scandal caused sentiment to turn against him, tho. Ignoring worked until it didn't. They learned nothing- just retreading an old playbook at a larger scale",whichwitch9,2025-04-29T14:01:54,5
"I’d say they learned a lot.  They learned they needed to stack the Supreme Court in their favor (thank you McConnell), they learned that if they needed to vet every republican member of congress with loyalty tests or they ran another candidate in the primary against them.  They learned that if you surround yourself with enough yes men they will commit crimes on your behalf and you can always just pardon them, and even dangle the pardon carrot to inspire loyalty.  They learned that if they just manufacture enough chaos that the 24/7 news cycle with just move on.  They learned that if they attack the “mainstream media” they can blur the line between news and propaganda and specifically they can present their own propaganda as news.    They learned a lot from Nixon and even more from Trumps first term.",funguy07,2025-04-29T14:28:07,2
