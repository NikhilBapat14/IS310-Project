"While true, that's for NPR proper; federal funding is much more impactful for local member radio stations that play NPR and other public broadcasting.  From the same article you linked to:  >CPB funding comprises on average approximately 8% of a public radio station's budget, and that percentage is highest among rural stations or stations in areas that are otherwise underserved, due to the challenges they face in raising additional revenue.  >Federal funding is an essential investment into local nonprofit, noncommercial public radio and television organizations, who rely on this funding to plan for the additional resources needed to support their operations, and take the actions needed to raise those funds and achieve a balanced budget. For every federal grant dollar received, on average, a public radio station is able to leverage those funds to raise seven times the amount from other sources such as local listener, foundation and business support.  >Eliminating funding or restricting stations from using their federal grants as they determine in their local interest would force those stations to procure or recreate these resources on their own (less efficiently and at a greater cost) or to eliminate public service programming that audiences want and need. The loss of federal funding could undermine stations' ability to procure programming, thereby weakening the local audience service and public media system institution.",pali1d,2025-05-02T04:03:39,40

"Like I JUST SAID, as disagreeable as it is, he had a reason based in misguided fears of worsening economic issues while not having the messaging or control to mediate the terms.   There's literally no point in arguing the semantics of his excuse. I already disagree with it.",StanVillain,2025-05-02T09:15:50,2

"I asked if they can override a majority.  A filibuster is a delay tactic, not an override.  It would have slowed government funding and made things worse for Democrats, but would not have stopped Republicans from passing what they want.  They are trying in the Courts though critics ignore that.",SavageSan,2025-05-02T08:20:27,3
That was one of the most terminally online quotes I've seen in the wild. Also probably the same kind of people who say they won't be blackmailed into voting a Democrat because of the Supreme Court and then have no idea why governing has shifted so far to the right.,Gnagus,2025-05-02T09:36:02,2

Thank you! Studies show US constituents hold zero sway while wealthy donors are in charge of the dems.  So many people on this sub are in deep denial.,FreeNumber49,2025-05-02T16:07:52,1
"These people are probably lost. Harris tried the ""lets get republicans"" thing, that went poorly. I think it's better to appeal to typical non-voters, like Trump statistically did (probably by accident). Much larger block, way more malleability, and lower chance of shedding your consistent voters.",bloodjunkiorgy,2025-05-02T19:20:43,1

"Just that they had no reason when not wanting the government to shut down is a reason. I disagree with it, but it isn't like we have no idea why they did it. The logic reflects one of the greatest issues with Democrats.   Weak, always on the defense leadership that focuses so much on maintaining the health of a decaying system that they fail to rise to the occasion in moments they need to stand up against it.",StanVillain,2025-05-02T09:49:08,3
"So you're saying I shouldn't listen to elected officials that keep saying we ""will"" be in a consitutional crisis soon, as if we haven't been in one for a while now? Or when elected officials hold public hearings only to silence any voices when pressed about needing to stop support for Israel? Or when Schumer himself said he thinks that if things got real bad, the people would stand up? What is the point of voting for these jokers if they're just going to put the responsibility of stopping a tryant on the people anyway? Can you explain why so many Democrats have voted yea on trump cabinet appointees? Why are they so desperate to play nice, when republicans would never ever return the favor? How long until they learn that decorum gets us nowhere?",Dragons_Malk,2025-05-02T10:00:23,1
