">The United States has approached China seeking talks over President Donald Trump's 145% tariffs, a social media account affiliated with Chinese state media said on Thursday, potentially signalling Beijing's openness to negotiations.  What happened to . . .   I mean come on - Trump's been claiming he's been talking to China for over a week now.  And now all of a sudden, he admits he is calling them asking them to call back?

"China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.  This is why USA now wants to play ball. Also, Japan too.  Trump Tariffs Like 'Delinquent Kid Extorting Somebody'—Japanese Lawmaker   https://www.newsweek.com/trump-tariffs-delinquent-kid-extorting-somebody-japanese-lawmaker-2061460    >Oguma in a speech during a parliamentary committee hearing told Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya that the nation should resist Trump's demands, likening the U.S. approach as a ""delinquent kid extorting someone,"" according to a Times of India translation.  >""If Japan listens to this and bends the other way in response to the impossible demands of bargaining and deals, it will set a bad example as a customary and historical precedent,"" Oguma said. ""If you get mugged and put money in their hands, they will come back to mug us.""  >Oguma called Trump's tariff formula ""a mess"" and questioned if it was ""safe for a serious person to go there"" and negotiate with the U.S.  >""Consider every option, but you should never make concessions to someone who is not straight up anyway,"" Oguma said, adding: ""I hope that you will never give in to the American extortionists. I know this is harsh to say, but they are extortionists.""  >""If you listen to what they say, it will be a really bad example,"" Oguma said.  >Iwaya meanwhile has called for a diplomatic approach to the still-developing U.S. trade policy, comparing the regular changes to ""a daily menu."" He previously called the tariffs ""regrettable,"" according to Japanese outlet Kyodo News.

""However, if the U.S. wishes to initiate contact, there is no harm at this stage for China to engage."" >  > ""China needs to observe closely, even force out the U.S.' true intentions, to maintain the initiative in both negotiation and confrontation,"" it concluded.  >Chinese officials have consistently stated that Beijing is open to talks, with the caveat that ""dialogue and negotiation must be based on equality, respect and mutual benefit.""",tech57,2025-05-01T05:22:59,1
