Same mentality that put George W Bush in office back in 2000. What's two wars and a severe recession compared to voting for a Russian sponsored Jill Stein?,RedneckLiberace,2024-10-25T15:19:14,55
"My guess is something terrible.   It's a protest vote. They aren't voting pragmatically, to influence the best outcome, they're voting so their conscience doesn't have to contest with having supported a Netanyahu military ally. It's purely an expression their personal morals and convictions.   There is no deeper political calculus.   For some of them, it's because they think Kamala will win anyway, and they just don't want their thumb in that pie.   For others, they figure that we ""survived"" one Trump presidency and can ""survive"" another.   In any case, it's in a move to soothe their conscience. And while I agree with their moral convictions, expressing them in this way is ultimately selfish, in my opinion.",CloudsTasteGeometric,2024-10-25T10:57:54,139
"The number of progressives I know who probably won’t vote for Kamala can be counted on two fingers. They also live in districts that will undoubtedly go blue. Their rationale is that their vote has more clout as a vote of dissent, (third party) not that they are rooting for Trump.   In their minds, giving material support to a rogue state is reprehensible whether a Democrat or Republican is at the helm. On this specific point, Kamala Harris has not actively or tangibly distinguished herself as being different from Trump. In this way, Harris has not *earned* their vote as a given.   In a vacuum, this thinking might make sense. However, if we’re going for overall harm reduction, this doesn’t hold up.",ManChildMusician,2024-10-25T11:10:10,41
"The rationale behind the strategy is to show to the democrats that the pro-Palestine voter base is a significant enough portion of the electorate that they can sway the election via slim margins in swing states, therefore the Dems need to meet their demands in order to win, and cannot ignore them or take them for granted.  I've spoken to a few progressives who privately told me their threats to vote 3rd party are bluffs and on election day will cast their ballot for Harris, but express support for Stein or West online and when polled to try and boost the movement's apparent size and leverage.  None of them want Trump to win, otherwise they'd just vote for Trump rather than 3rd party or abstaining.  There are three prevalent ideas on what a Trump presidency would mean for Gaza:  1. It indeed would be worse, which is why they want Harris to adopt the right policy so they can vote for her in good conscious. 2. Nothing in Gaza would be any different. You used the phrase 'Trump will ""let"" Israel completely level Gaza'. ""Let"" meaning this is what Netenyahu wants to do, but currently cannot. The belief is that there is already nothing Netenyahu wants to do that he already do, because the Biden administration has let them get away with so much and provided unconditional military support even after he crossed supposed red lines like an incursion into Rafah or expanding the war into Lebanon. If Netenyahu tries to completely level Gaza and resettle it in the next 4 years, Harris will continue the Biden policy of signing off on all the Israel funding bills, vetoing impactful resolutions against Israel at the UN, and refusing to impose any sanctions on them. 3. The democratic establishment would start being anti-war and aggressively against Israeli policy if Trump was the one in office backing it, and that additional attention and scrutiny could lead to a better outcome for the people of Palestine. There is a history of the democrats in Washington and on mainstream media going silent or even being supportive of right wing policies when they're being done by a Democrat in the White House. For example, journalist Jeremy Scahill has recounted how MSNBC would bring him on all the time to criticize the Iraq and Afghanistan wars under George Bush, but stopped inviting him on to discuss US war crimes once Obama was president. Many pointed out during the Trump years that the ""kids in cages"" policy actually started under Obama, yet no one was talking about it. Most recently, you have Harris backing the bipartisan border bill which includes border wall funding that most of the Democratic Party criticized when Trump was trying to build it.",Atmostfear98,2024-10-25T17:02:50,11

"Ultimately, the job of winning votes is the candidate. Progressives who were enthusiastic about Kamala were urging her that she needs to adopt a more progressive position on Israel to win. During the primaries, progressive voters came out in impactful numbers to vote undecided or uncommitted in key battleground states. I can't think of anything more progressives could have done to make it clear what would win their vote.  The Kamala campaign then basically came out and said, ""nah fam, we can win without you"". Now that Kamala is looking less and less likely to win, the same people who made it very clear what their important issue was are being blamed for the bad decisions of the Kamala campaign. Every ounce of blame if Kamala loses is on her and the campaign. They turned away voters eager to vote for her in defense of Israel.",4ku2,2024-10-25T19:12:50,8

"It’s more than that, this is a referendum against Harris and get courting of Bush/Cheney republicans. The DNC has moved sharply to the right recently , Harris wants to militarize the border   , she and Biden increased fracking and drilling, Harris is taking donations from tech giants being investigated for anti trust by Lena Khan and she is now floating the idea of firing Khan (head of the FTC) , Harris is pro war and her stance on Israel and Ukraine is one of supporting (funding and arming) the conflicts as opposed to be of finding peace and resolution which is why the Big 5 arms manufacturers are donating to her in bulk.  By resisting and voting for Stein or the newly joint campaigns of Claudia DeLa Cruz and Cornell West, it sends a powerful message . If she loses and we see a large chunk of progressives voting third party or sitting this one out it will shake the DNC to its core and force them to abandon this rightward shift and get back to being beholden to voters . As a progressive who feels trump and Harris share similar policy , I feel four short years of Trump to ensure a true Democrat ticket in 2028 is very worth it.   Besides , how can any true democrat vote for a woman who is floating the idea of cabinet or high level roles for Dick Cheney, Liz Cheney and Condi Rice . The Dems are becoming the GOP of 2003, so basically we have a choice between two republicans , one a neocon hellbent on war, the other an isolationist hellbent on exiting the global community.

"Many progressives believe that by NOT voting for Kamala they’re sending some kind of message that will move the Democrats further left. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how politics work. Politicians are influenced by their voters, not people who don’t consistently vote. That’s why Republicans win so often - they vote every time. Democrats (especially progressives) do not operate as pragmatically. Thus, by NOT voting, progressives are actually going to be pushing Dems further to the right so that they can score votes of people who show up consistently. It’s wasted money and effort to try to persuade someone who may or may not show up. That’s why progressives have lost seats the past couple of years and why Dems are further right than they have been previously - that’s where the support comes from. If progressives were actually pragmatic, they would know that voting doesn’t mean that you fully endorse every issue and decision. You vote for who is going to get you CLOSEST to what you want, and oscillate for the change you want to see once they’re in office.   If progressives actually cared about the people of Gaza, they would vote for the person most likely to stand up to Israel’s far right government. By not voting or voting for a third party, you’re not insulating your conscience - you’re saying you don’t actually care if Trump gets into office and helps speed up the genocide.",[deleted],2024-11-02T15:41:08,1

"I'd offer that the progressives are the problem here. Most liberals want to see a ceasefire in Gaza and to stop arming Israel in this war of massive civilian casualties and displacement (some might call this genocide, or at least apartheid), but they also recognise that Israel has a right to exist, to defend itself from a sea of Iran-backed aggressors and militias at its borders, and that the acts on Oct 7 were brutal terrorism, marked by legitimate and horrific acts of mass rape and sexual mutiliations of women and girls, despite some cases of misreporting.  It seems like progressives are the problem here, and the reason for their cognitive dissonance in standing idly by as a dementia-addled, rapey, far-right nutcase seeks the highest office in the land is...well it's multifactorial, and it goes pretty deep, in my opinion.  For one thing, they view Israel as an illegitimate settler colony and Hamas as anti-capitalist, anti-colonialist uprising against it. Many seem to think nothing short of the dissolution of the Israeli state is acceptable, and that Israel (as perhaps a puppet state of America and NATO) is the sole bad actor and agressor standing in the way of peace in the region. They seem to think that a forced displacement of tens of millions of Jews, including mostly nonwhite, ethnically Arab Mizrahi Jews, as well as a great number of nonreligious people and Muslims seeking certain kinds of tolerance, from the country is an acceptable consequence, and that enacting violence against civilians is an acceptible means of reaching these ends.  For another, things going back to normal, the temperature turning down, things going well, is all antithetical to their mission. People stopped paying attention to them or needing them during the Biden presidency the way they were elevated, included, and in some cases even centred in the 'resistance' to Trump. When it comes to actually governing and legislating as part of the majority, they offer essentially no actionable policy or strategic value of any kind. Look at the incompetence, infighting, and outright corruption where progressives captured institutions during the Biden presidency (Ibram X Kendi's antiracism institution or the CHAZ/CHOP as examples). Most people are kind of coming around to the fact that a lot of far left ideas and tactics are exhausting and stupid, and they want nothing to do with them. They'd rather win elections and protect healthcare or abortion rights than chase dorm room Marxism.   And anyways, they ultimately they view the decision between Harris and Trump as a fundamentally false one because they see both as tools of the same fundamentally oppressive system. To them, both are capitalist, colonialist, supporters of a police state which exists to protect white property and wealthy capitalists at the expense of the working class, women, BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalised groups. I've noticed progressives are increasingly accelerationist, anticipating or even hoping for the violent collapse of the system into a violent clash between intersectional anarcho-socialists and white fascists. They seem to think liberals and centrists are sort of...de facto on the side of the fascists for some reason? 'Culpable'? Idk. Many progressives also indirectly kinda shun electoral politics, democracy, and legislative process because they don't think they'll ever establish their ideal society by democratic means.",CarelessRaisin,2024-11-05T14:58:46,1

"""Completely level Gaza if he takes office...""  https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/blinken-approves-sale-israel-military-equipment-worth-over-20-bln-2024-08-13/  Perhaps the Trump Administration would approve a $40 billion weapon package? What about all those efforts for a ceasefire?  https://www.npr.org/2024/02/20/1232636543/un-security-council-gaza-cease-fire-vote  The Democratic Party's main selling point on this issue (and others) is  a fear mongering campaign about another Trump Administration. On this issue, the problem is the Democrats are in power. In power, they have completely capitulated to a genocide.    Yes, Donald Trump is dangerous to democracy. He has dictorial tendencies, if not ambition. He has a history of sexual assault and is a threat to women. He is a racist and a xenophobe. If he is elected, he will not even pay Palestine the empty lip service, and sometimes bread and water. I will not vote for him.  But that is not a reason for me to vote for Kamala Harris. Because it is clear whoever you vote for will not improve the situation in Gaza. So if I am to participate in the Democracy the Democrats so nominally cherish, I will find a candidate that is more closely aligned to my values. And that is not only on this issue.  But it's a duopoly! A Third Party will never win! I'm going to let every Democrat, Republican, and everyone in the middle in on a secret. Everyone knows this. Even the politically disengaged. It takes a lot more to stand against the system than it does to pacifically participate in it.   Will a Third Party win this Presidency or any in the forseeable future? No. Can it grow? Absolutely.   One of the key reasons you will always have Third Party Candidates in Presidential Races is because it is one of the few avenues to garner publicity to spread the message.   If this is successful, it will make it easier to garner ballot access in the lower-level races the Democrats have recently become so fond of mocking the Greens over. That doesn't even get into the necessity of national races for party recognition and potential federal funding.   TLDR: If you don't care about empty lip service, the Democrats have proven no better than Trump on Palestine. Everyone knows it's a 2-Party System. There is a legitimate strategy.

"A lot of these people didn’t vote for Hillary and then saw where that got us and voted for Biden. However the end result is now that Kamala is running her campaign to the right of Biden on some key issues (immigration comes to mind). Now those same people feel like their vote doesn’t matter and the democrats will continue to run further and further right if they suck it up and vote for Kamala.   Given this, there is a non-zero chance that Ds could run on overturning obergefell and leaving it up to the states next election cycle but claim you still have to vote for them because of abortion. Would your calculus change in this scenario?   The debate here is not whether Trump is worse than Kamala (pretty much everyone debating whether to stay home or not among progressives agrees he is). The calculus for them is what kind of message it sends to the Dems.

"In every election since I've been able to vote, I've been told that my progressive interests are unpopular and that I *need* to vote for the democrats because the Republicans are dangerous for the country. I have watched as these officials who I voted for go against my interests on a regular basis but still bought into the 'vote blue no matter who' narrative.  This time around, the democrats are asking me to ignore complicity in a genocide. We progressives have been making it clear for many months that this is the grounds on which we will vote, and every single time, the democrats have told us to suck it up because of Trump and we need to give Israel unlimited bombs because some mythical median suburban voter wants that to happen.   We spoke up before the convention in the tens of thousands in vital swing states, showing our voting power. At the convention, calls for a singular Palestinian speaker was not only rejected, but entirely ignored. *Democrat* progressives have been saying not to take the progressives for granted. The campaign and the administration have done *nothing*, literally *nothing* to address our concerns.  So no, I won't accept any responsibility (I live in a blue state anyway) for the Harris campaign and the democratic party ignoring every call for a policy change.

"""Moral superiority"" ... ...  Although insulting voters has been part of the Democratic party's strategy this election, I'm going to assume that accusation came from a place of hurt, and therefore says more about your sense of desperation, which I do understand, rather than an actual attempt to hurt someone else in a misguided attempt to alleviate your own pain.   You ask me to vote for you and other women ... but *I've done that.* I'm very pro-choice.  I understand that acorns are not trees and that most fetal abnormalities can only be identified late in a pregnancy's term. My mom likes to tell people how she took me marching in Washington when I was a little boy, circa 1990, chanting ""Hey George, get out of my Bush"".    And more than that, I believe that our industrial activities have a negative impact on the environment.  I think the fact that we can genetically analyze a deadly virus and develop a highly effective vaccine within a year is one of the greatest triumphs of science.  I support Ukraine 100%.   But now, let me ask *you* to do something.   Go watch some videos of Palestinian hospital patients being burned alive by American bombs supplied to Israel by the Biden administration, and then ask yourself if that's the cost you're willing to pay to have reproductive healthcare rights.   Go watch some videos of Israelis breaking into Palestinian schools and beating women and children with bats, or Israelis throwing Palestinians off of rooftops (alive or not), or read the NYT article ""How Israel's Army Uses Palestinians as Human Shields"" or the CNN article ""More than 130 Israeli reservists sign letter refusing to fight in Gaza and Lebanon"", wherein a solider stated he believed it was ""a mitzvah, or Jewish religious duty, to kill Palestinians in Gaza, including children, 'because they would grow up to be terrorists'"", and then ask yourself if that's the price you're willing to pay for abortion rights.   Go watch some videos of desperate cats and dogs in Gaza literally eating rotting corpses, and ask yourself if that's the cost of your reproductive rights.   Maybe the answer, *for you* is yes.  If so, then *I completely 100% understand*, and I will not judge you one iota.    But, this election, it's too much for **me**. It's just too much.    And I truly feel pain and helplessness for my sisters in this nation because of the dire situation regarding reproductive freedom, *but I have carried my weight on that issue for 24 years of elections.*   For 24 years, with one exception, I have voted against the party of greater evil. But I cannot tell which party that is anymore.  For the first time, maybe because I'm older and wiser (or older and more jaded, more cynical), maybe because genocide really is just too much of a price for me to pay, or maybe because of all that and more, I cannot do it.    Casting my vote in the past few elections has felt more and more like going to the doctor to get a horrible treatment to alleviate the symptoms of some horrible, chronic disease.  And in every cycle, the disease is worse, but so too is the treatment. And I'm sorry, and I'm sorry, and I'm sorry again ... but I'm at the point now, whether I'd rather forego the treatment, and succumb to the disease.    And I see you and other well-intentioned brothers and sisters walking into the treatment room.  Telling me to hang on, telling me to rage against the dying of the light, imploring me to stay the course and continue the good fight.    But I've just spent too much of something inside of me over the course of too many elections.  And if the treatment now is genocide, then the ""light"" is already dead and ""the good fight"" is already lost.

Also really most wars and decisions are based on power with the illusion of peace or good. When really the people who decide if we actually go to war are not doing it as morally perfect individuals.  Also is it possible to have more death in the near future to prevent more deaths down the road, or visa versa? Should we follow the path where 1 million people die in the next year so that only 500,000 people die in the next 10 years. Or a path where 3 million people die over the next 10 years? I don't know. None of us are qualified or well informed enough to make these decisions tbh.

With more publicity more people are aware of its existence and may even look into their platform and candidates.   If that leads to support, it will help bring in funding that will allow for ballot access into races outside of the Presidency. You have to consider Third Parties are typically not funded by anything substantial, like a Super PAC.

"I have republican friends and family, i am not saying there is only one way to do things. There used to be lots of work done across the aisle. It didnt used to be a black and white zero sum game in politics and that is the reason that i believe Trump is the wrong person for the office.  Newt started that tactic and every republican including McConnell have amplified the divisiveness of it and weaponized congress with it. It needs to stop.",seamus_mc,2024-10-25T14:10:05,1

I don’t have to agree on everything. Being anti-Genocide should be a base level requirement for elected officials.   Doesn’t seem like it is for you though. Seems like you are cool with the Genocide as long as Trump is not doing it.,BGDutchNorris,2024-10-28T10:42:27,0

Kamala Harris could distance herself from his foreign policy (lotta people want her to show how she is different from Biden). Especially when Netanyahu is kissing Trump’s ring and not listening to Biden at all.,BGDutchNorris,2024-10-28T17:29:06,1

"Harris is far more equivocating in her policy stance toward Israel than trump is. She is not offering Netanyahu a blank check.   The reality is that the US needs Israel as an ally in the region. We also don’t want to see Israel destroyed (as Hamas wants). Harris does not want, and will not enable, a genocide. She has emphasized that position repeatedly.",Fresh-Preference-805,2024-10-28T20:14:49,1

"Voting for the best presidential candidate (that You may not 100% agree with, but from what we have to choose from) and being politically active, protesting, writing letters, voting for midterm elections, voting for state, county, and local candidates that are in line with your political views are not mutually exclusive. You can do both! Protesting by not voting is literally taking your own voice away, which is the worst thing you can do if you want to have an impact. Big party candidates are not interested in non-voters.",bunskerskey,2024-10-25T14:25:51,3

This is a very caring and thought out answer. Much respect if you do more than myself which is just commenting online and discussing things with friends/family/peers to make more informed decisions and connect with people across the aisle to empathize with each other.  I am a lazy person and assume most people have much more to lose than myself. I am trying to empathize but it's hard to always be fighting and I also don't think people should be condemned if they are too beat down to fight. I try and treat other's the way I want to be treated and tbh I don't like when people try and help me and I am a bit of a hermit to society lmao.,oiledupnik,2024-10-25T14:41:27,0
"The problem is personally I don't care about most things and I can deal with a lot and have lots of privilege.       If I didn't like my local politics I would move or work towards moving. If someone I cared about needed an abortion I would help them cross state lines for it. I would not depend on the government for anything actually to have the best interest in mind for myself and the people I care about.       This is now me attempting to help my fellow man because most people have families or are not as privileged as myself.      I feel like you aren't answering my 1 question.
