Trump do something illegal? No shit. He has been his entire life.,Tomrepo92,2025-04-29T16:01:40,56
"I still have trouble understanding how these institutions get illegal orders, and they just, follow it, then fight after the fact.  They shouldn't just be blindly complying with shit that seems wrong, they should be asking for proof, or written justification before lifting a finger to sabotage themselves.",Gekokapowco,2025-04-29T17:39:54,51
PBS caved and they still all got fired. SMH. When will people learn there’s no negotiation with the mad king?,mexicanmanchild,2025-04-29T17:30:17,18

How?  It’s a private corporation.,B1GFanOSU,2025-04-29T18:19:29,6
So they're suing him? Like in a court of law? With a judge?   What good is that supposed to do?   Trump doesn't care about courts and judges.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-29T18:09:56,4

I am laughing right now. I agree with you. I am getting kind of sick of these types of articles. I need something more surprising in the news.,CautiousToe6644,2025-04-29T17:40:00,2
"Exactly. If I'm at work and some dude walks in and tells me I'm fired and I don't recognize his authority I just ignore it. I never understood why they, knowing he has no power here, would bother doing what he says",BreakdancingGorillas,2025-04-29T19:07:41,21

And an orange is orange.,Xanderson,2025-04-30T01:16:17,1
"I believe that is what they did.  This lawsuit is telling him 'fuck you' we aren't going anywhere.  My personal belief is that in this climate, a lawsuit is a protective move so they don't accidentally get 'lost in some paperwork' in the middle of the night.",CAD_Chaos,2025-04-29T21:11:41,8
