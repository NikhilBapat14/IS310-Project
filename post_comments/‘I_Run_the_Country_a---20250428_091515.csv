"> We made our pitch, which went like this: *President Donald Trump, by virtue of winning a second term and so dramatically reshaping the country and the world, can now be considered the **most consequential American leader** of the 21st century, and we want to describe, in detail, how this came to be.*  It is a well known fact that all you need to do to get an audience is to lie and praise him.",nwgdad,2025-04-28T09:26:22,5
"This blathering megalomaniacal moron.  Yes, *until* Trump you could argue that the POTUS had a large part in ""running the world"".   But *after*? Never again. The entire world is furiously working on cutting dependance on the US, and the US will **never** regain it's former influence no matter how much this orange POSOTUS beats his flabby chest.",Reno_Potato,2025-04-28T10:09:57,5

You can’t lead the free world when can’t even lead a free country!,Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-28T12:32:47,1
"He is literally the president of the United States, so not just some random person on the street claiming to influence worldwide affairs.  But yes, he is surrounded by sycophants and yes men and also delusional.",0002millertime,2025-04-28T09:52:19,4

"The “leader of the free world” certainly used to mean something, and at times rang true. After Bush and Trump however, it’s at best an anachronistic moniker.   I don’t know how anyone can think this about the presidency anymore.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-04-28T10:19:24,2
Quick question   How are the words that you put together to form a sentence in any way relevant to the comment I made?  Thanks.,SaveHogwarts,2025-04-28T09:23:22,10
"Honestly a lot of US influence was based on shared values, mutual defense pacts, stability and *trust*.   All of that evaporated almost overnight as soon as he took the presidency.  I would take Bush in a heartbeat over Trump. The guy is absolutely batshit insane.",Reno_Potato,2025-04-28T10:28:31,1
"Bush was a terrible president and the world would be a much better place if he never took office, however I truly think he meant well and took his job seriously.   Trump on the other hand could give two shits about anything other than his ego. If he has to tear down the United States, and even the entire world to serve his ego, he would do it both willingly, and gladly.",Advanced-Ad-4462,2025-04-28T10:42:43,3
