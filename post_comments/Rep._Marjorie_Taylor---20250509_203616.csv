Even worse for GA people - she's running for governor!,Ok_World_8819,2025-05-09T20:37:33,56
She’s running for Grand Wizard instead ,MrSnrub_92,2025-05-09T20:51:23,37
She got paid off not to run.   Maybe this was her plan all along,velvet_funtime,2025-05-09T20:50:45,16
Can she run right into a brickwall that's painted like a road all acme style? For science.,SundinShootsPing500,2025-05-09T20:53:28,12
"The only thing she should run for, is the hills.  She is not welcome here.",Crim91,2025-05-09T20:56:18,12
"Marge is a loudmouthed idiot zealot, but even she has to realize that she has zero chance of winning statewide there. The only reason she even holds a Congressional seat is because her district is gerrymandered to the extreme.",AkronRonin,2025-05-09T20:48:51,12

"I’m disappointed.  I wanted Greene to run.  Any chance to more highlight her extreme far right, ultra Christian nationalist, Qanon connected, conspiracy theory peddling, complete lack of class ass would have been a great chance.  Shame.    Here’s to hoping she reconsiders.",Resident_Nothing_659,2025-05-09T22:36:42,9
"Greene correctly recognizes that the knuckle-draggers she depends on are concentrated in isolated fever swamps of ignorance and bigotry.     A Nazi troglodyte like Greene can't win a state-wide election in Georgia.  Maybe in Hell, but not in Georgia.",Beantown-Jack,2025-05-09T21:10:18,8

">“Someone once said, ‘The Senate is where good ideas go to die.’ They were right. That’s why I’m not running,” Greene [wrote in a post on X](https://x.com/mtgreenee/status/1920986377707024698?s=46).  Not that MTG every HAD any good ideas.  >“I won’t fight for a team that refuses to win, that protects its weakest players, and that undermines the very people it’s supposed to serve,” she added.  OK, but you've done absolutely nothing for your constituents.  >“It’s really nice to have options, and I’ll make a decision based on where I think I can be most effective,” she said at the time.  I wouldn't even vote for you to be President of your local HOA. The best place for your bleach blonde, bad built butch body, is nowhere.",southernfirefly13,2025-05-09T20:55:49,2

She'd lose.,williamgman,2025-05-09T21:36:57,2
The only way she can get elected is from the ridiculously gerrymandered district that makes it next to impossible for a Democrat to win.,Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-09T21:50:38,2
Damn. It would have been so entertaining.,Bigfoqt,2025-05-09T21:56:20,2

"No, that's excellent news.  Flip the governor seat for once if she does!",thieh,2025-05-09T20:41:28,35
If they were smart they would run a prior-military male that owns a southern fried chicken resultant and says things like yall and yonder. But they will prolly run the only person that can loose to Karen shrek.,Emotional_Insect4874,2025-05-10T07:36:42,2

I hate this kind of shit. They are people exploited by the rich and the religious and then told everyone hates them. And everyone then makes fun of them says snarky shit and is generally just a piece of shit.,Mickyspanicky,2025-05-10T05:29:38,0

"I’m sorry but if you’ve live 20+ years on this earth and haven’t yet figured out that racism, sexism, homophobia, and elitism isn’t good, you can get royally fucked. I don’t care about you or them.

Yes some that aren’t racists fell for the bullshit rhetoric and lies but I swear to all that if you can’t see that blatantly bigoted base for who they are, you are lost to us all   Wake the fuck up, because they sure haven’t and they most likely won’t.

"They carry around little rectangles with the ENTIRE. FUCKING. WORLD in it. Ignorance is a choice.   Walk through a house that has a framed picture of the Confederate States of America. See the copy of ""Southern By The Grace of God' next to their Bible (not that they've actually read either)  These semiliterate fuckwits have given us this evil bitch THRICE. They pine for a day when the antebellum Southern plantations were grand. They dance around the fires Trump sets.

"Those terms aren't mutually exclusive. These troglodytes are both.   We're on the march, as centrists, to find that small sliver of actual citizens that want to seek and understand solutions.
