From Trump's mentor Roy Cohn :  The three rules of PR —      Attack! Attack! Attack!      Admit nothing and deny everything.      No matter what happens you claim victory and never admit defeat. You have to be willing to do anything to anyone.  China is going to hand Trump his ass.,biscuitarse,2025-04-25T18:05:43,15

">Unannounced reduction to zero of tariffs on U.S. imports of certain semiconductor and integrated circuit products  It depends on what you consider caving.  Narrowly tailored technology imports?

"[Excerpts from an article titled China Holds More Cards in the Trade War than Trump Thinks They Do.](https://asiatimes.com/2025/04/china-holds-more-trade-war-cards-than-trump-thinks/#)  Beijing believes it can inflict at least as much damage on the US as vice versa, while at the same time expanding its global position.”  In 2018 the US counted for 19% of China’s export, in 2023 12%  “China also understands that the US cannot easily replace its dependency on Chinese goods, particularly through its supply chains. While direct US imports from China have decreased, many goods now imported from third countries still rely on Chinese-made components or raw materials.”  “By 2022, the US relied on China for 532 key product categories – nearly four times the level in 2000 – while China’s reliance on US products was cut by half in the same period”",cedarhat,2025-04-25T18:40:09,3

"If the reports on the retaliatory tariffs are correct, than this is likely China offering a miniscule concession to begin the process of de-escalation. It's pretty standard diplomacy in these situations and, thus, virtually a guarantee that Trump had nothing to do with it.       See the ""Checkpoint Charlie"" incident in Berlin 1961, where American and Soviet tanks stood barrel to barrel at a bridge for over a day. Eventually, the Soviets ceded something ludicrous (an inch or something) and the US went back another inch. Each side used the initial concession as justification for more further and more dramatic concessions until the bridge was vacated.   As to why China might be doing it--there are dueling fantasies on Reddit that either Trump has all the cards or China has all the cards and, the reality is, neither of them have any cards and the bureaucrats and diplomats who do the day-to-day work of making the world work know that. Neoliberal foreign policy is built on the idea that, fundamentally, we'll be so involved in each other's economies that it would disincentivize open conflict. IF, and that's a big IF, it's true than that's likely what we're seeing in action.",430_Autogyro,2025-04-25T18:58:45,1
