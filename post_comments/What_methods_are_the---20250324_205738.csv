"Well, this is no mean feat.   It's obvious that we're moving away from media in the traditional sense, as can be seen with the decline of legacy media (e.g CNN) and the growth of new media (e.g Joe Rogan).   Social media is offering free ""custom"" news. Of course, this brings with it significant disconnection and bias. It takes views to the extreme. The right go further right, and the left go further left. It means that people get stuck into their viewpoints and don't leave them.  The solution?  I'm unsure, but I think it's very clear that social media is by no means going away. It's growing. I don't think AI's going to help either (because it can be, like social media, individually customised). Yet this isn't going away either.  I suppose one potential is to identify and address bias in the news, to at least push people into recognising that there are other points of view. Moreover, there are platforms such as GROUND news, which state the facts of an event rather than a biased editorial. If these can be adopted by more and more people then we can aim to somewhat solve this issue.  Either way, social media is the path we have taken. It is a path of free and comprehensive information. It is also a path of niched and potentially inaccurate information.   Either way, it is the path that we've chosen, and that can't be changed.",the_magus73,2025-03-25T00:23:26,9

"A number of people here have said “bring back the fairness doctrine”.  We don’t need it. If we really wanted truth we know how to get it. If I’m shopping for a car that has 4 wheel drive, I’m not going to a source that’s predisposed to Subarus. I’m going to seek out information on different cars.  If I’m working with a realtor looking for a home and the realtor only shows me his office’s listings, I’m dropping that realtor. I don’t need the government to force realtors to practice “fairness” in selecting listings for me to see.  If I’m really interested in an issue, I’ll listen to different sources. If I find that one source ignores stories, I’ll drop that source.  If particular source finds themselves losing to another source, they’ll either change or risk losing followers and go out of business.

Subreddit mods have a free hand to craft whatever echo chamber they want. Facebook groups can exclude anyone or any content for any reason.  There are many ways to reduce misinformation and information silos online. Community notes provide factual context without removing the original misinformation. AI could make these tools even more effective. Algorithms could be tuned to promote factual information over clickbait.  Unfortunately, any social media company who makes a serious effort to reduce the spread of misinformation will lose market share to others who don't.

">What methods are there for media reform to improve the quality of news reporting, and raise awareness to more topical and relevant information to the public, without using censorships?  Solely in my opinion:   \- Increase general education. I'm an old guy and my whole life I've watched education get cut and cut and cut. I sincerely thought that one day Americans would realize their mistake but it hasn't happened. Instead, it seems many Americans are now suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect, where they are so dumb that they don't realize how dumb they are. I fully admit I have been extremely fortunate to have been educated as much as I have been. But as part of my education, I was taught how to write an essay with REPUTABLE sources. The American public just needs to go through the same.  \- People need to demand better reporting and demand to have their views challenged. I have often complained in YouTube comments about the topics certain political channels cover. I don't know if I made up the term, or picked it up somewhere, but there is an epidemic of ""rageporn"". By that, I mean, there seems to be a significant portion of the population that is addicted to consuming content that talks about how bad the ""other side"" is and they enjoy bashing them, assumably to make themselves feel better and help their self-esteem. I have often challenged the content creators of such channels with ""what's the point of this coverage? In what ways do you think you are helping the situation?"" Anyway, my point is the current reporting that is being demanded by the public is of the rageporn sort. Until a decent amount of the general public changes their demands, things will continue this way.",ReditGuyToo,2025-03-27T22:29:07,1

"Repeal Section 230 of the telecommunications act.  This section basically gives blanket immunity for all social media for any content on their networks. Contrast this with basically any other news outlet, who is considered the editor of content on their publication and is responsible for printing it.  This has directly led to  social media companies and their algorithms that promote and drive misinformation and polarization.  Facebook should absolutely be responsible for the content it pushes, because it is absolutely editorializing via its algorithm which is pushing a tailored feed to every individual.  If social media presents content based *only*.on who you follow and *only* in chronological order of posting, then they can be considered to be a neutral network.  But as soon as they are pushing content you didn't subscribe to and in an order they seem, that's editorializing.

"Right-Wing radio got the ball rolling, and Fox News took it even further, but neither could possibly have hoped to be as efficient and as widespread as social media has been. And after all, Fox news's greatest accomplishment is convincing not just right-wingers, but also left wingers that all legacy media is necessarily bad. So now everyone gets their news from poorly sourced social media, which drives them further and further into polarization. No one relies on journalism, everyone's so fucking angry, and at the same time, everyone seems to not know what the hell they're talking about.  But I'll tell you this much: in an era that lacked social media, where we relied exclusively on legacy media, Trump would not be president. He owes his entire presidency to twitter, and social media at large.   And no, the old system wasn't perfect. There are voices being heard today that would not have been heard then. But we have sufficiently killed the idea that the internet spreads knowledge far and wide -- it is incredibly outpaced by ignorance, and the anger it encourages. People have never been more confident in what they know, and as a result, they know less than they have in centuries. We need a restoration of humility, and a respect for expertise, and the appreciation of the hard work that goes into good journalism.",TheOvy,2025-03-25T10:04:50,7

H. L. Hunt openly urges big business not to rely on contributions to finance the radical right but to use their advertising funds.

"> Even Sotomayor wouldn't be able to justify it.  She would. Roberts probably would too. In fact, even the Conservative majority has noticed the party eating itself, and just about realises they'll be the next group branded 'RINOs'.   >Well, I disagree that state control of the media is a good thing.  It's like my issue with so-called ""privacy advocates"", they're so busy hand wringing over mythological 'state control' that they never spent any time wondering what the private sector was up to.   In this case, you're dissembling over ""state control"" when the matter at hand is *reasonable regulation*, but in the process what you've done is allow unelected corporations complete control over every word you read or hear.   Even you have to have noticed that the 'American Experiment' is over and that the result is self-destruction entirely because foolish Republicans handed full unfettered control of the media to people like Musk and Bezos. It turns out democracy is for sale, and you're entirely happy with that outcome.  People literally died during Covid choking out denials that the virus even existed or could kill as their last words, because they'd become so addicted to the Republican media sphere.",epsilona01,2025-03-26T13:00:21,0
"> People literally died during Covid choking out denials that the virus even existed or could kill as their last words, because they'd become so addicted to the Republican media sphere.   Fox news didn't spout denial out of thin air. That came from the president making it into a political matter and trying to look good. FN and the like would not have changed their tune under a fairness act when the executive itself is spouting the nonsense.    Furthermore, how is such an act going to work in the age of podcasts and digital media? Are we going to censor kids who blow up in media because they report ""news"" we don't like? Or do we rip a page out of the CCP's book? It is easy to spout fairness act, but a lot harder to figure out how to implement in our society when freedom of speech is a cornerstone of our law.",Sageblue32,2025-03-26T15:18:22,0

"If you have to result to insults at the merest push back, then you are thinking more on emotions than rationale and are not in a proper state to discuss how to achieve your desired goal.    >Radio   As brought up before. Government was able to push more influence through the limitation of the airways and said waves being metered out by the gov. You would not be able to do that today as any tom, dick, and hairy can host their own network and start talking about how little grey men are controlling the world. Multiply that out times the size of the internet vs. ~13 stations that cut off at 9 pm and it is a huge task. In current modern day we only see control states like China attempt it. Or India with waning results.   >Fox   You really want to argue Fox gave Trump his marching orders as opposed to Trump being Trump and refusing to yield or be wrong?
