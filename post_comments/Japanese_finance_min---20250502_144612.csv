">Why it matters: Japan is the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasuries, and even the vaguest hint that it could dump those holdings is powerful leverage with the administration. Following through on the threat could cause interest rates to spike.",AssociateGreat2350,2025-05-02T15:03:12,19

"Japan reached out to Canada during their first dump.  They promptly put out a statement they're working with us to ""stabilize global markets"", as the US seeks isolationism.  The sale promtly stopped during that call.  To stave the bleed, UK and Canada picked up $40b more, each.  We're  ~$400b now.  UK I think is ~$800b.  You know Carney also worked for BoE.    $1.3t + $800b + $400b is not a small number.    I believe Carney is waiting to speak with Trump Tuesday, in person, to determine the next steps.  It's likely in the playbook.  But a rapid dump at different times could damage the investment.  So, he's likely being leveraged to help the exit of those investments.  But, I wouldn't expect a total dump of >$2t of public debt immediately.  As funny as it might be.",Postom,2025-05-02T16:10:46,11
"This is the point I keep trying to make to Canadians. Yeah, the threats to their sovereignty is probably worse to them than tariffs, and I understand why. But MAGA are so incredibly selfish, they don't care that Trump is making those threats. They *will* care about tariffs making their shit more expensive, the world needs to care about this economic warfare because it's an effective way to make MAGA feel the effects of their own policy. ***They're too stupid to understand unless you hit them with a metaphorical brick.***",CoopDonePoorly,2025-05-02T18:33:05,5

"I called the Japanese Consulate today, asking the Consul to please encourage the Japanese Prime Minister to dump US Treasuries. I explained that the only way to stop Trump's  extortion once-and-for-all was to make the Trump cult hurt, bad. Of course, I explained that all Americans would suffer (including me), but unless the Trump cult feels direct and serious pain, Japan and the rest of the world will have to endure many years of Trump-like fascism and extortion.",opinionsareus,2025-05-02T16:19:00,7
Bonds are what you have faith in a promissory note if you will. If you start selling bonds it puts downward pressure on the US dollar. Then all of a sudden it questions the future as the primary reserve currency.  Also it would make borrowing more expensive for the United States government as well as potentially higher mortgage rates.,Broke-Till-Payday,2025-05-02T15:05:38,16
"The more bonds get sold and not bought, the … more costly(?), harder(?)…  it is for the government to borrow, and therefore US firms and households to also borrow. Even something like credit cards, which most have variable interest rates, will get hit with higher interest.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-02T15:26:05,3
"The US government has not able to fully finance their spending with existing tax revenue, so they must borrow money. The way they do this is by issuing bonds. Investors give the US money to spend in return for interest payments.  For example, let’s say US Bonds pay out a total amount ($50) and start at $1000. That’s a 5% return on investment. The US government has to spend 5 cents extra of future income for every dollar raised now.  Japan holds a ton of these US bonds. If they decide to dump them and sell it at say $800, investors will buy these instead of bonds sold by the US government directly. Because the bonds are tradeable on the open market, anybody can own it and get the $50 interest payments from the USA.  In order for the USA to continue borrowing money to spend on their budget deficit, they must start offering the bonds at 50/800 = 6.25% yield. Otherwise investors just buy the US bonds from Japan which cost $800 and offer the same $50 interest. Investors will only accept an equal or better price from the US government.  So in this example the US government has to spend extra 6.25 cents of future income per dollar raised now. This makes it harder to pay back the loans, harder to generate a net positive benefit on the loans, etc.  The other option for the US government to get more money to spend is “quantitative easing” ie print more money. And that is going to devalue the US dollar, cause inflation and tank the US Dollar’s position as the world reserve currency. No country wants to hold US dollars which are getting more worthless every year.",SG_wormsblink,2025-05-02T22:46:03,3

"Not into econ.  I understand the math behind it all, based on my work in software modeling.    *If* my belief is correct, Carney will work to protect assets of allies in the UST bonds market if an exit is planned.  Don't do anything yet, or find a decent asset manager to help divest.  Carney won't direct dumping 2t in US debt overnight.  He'd likely take a trickle approach.  Hence why he seems to have made a call, and UK + CA propped it back up for short term.  If he wanted to, he'd probably be able to direct and have the US bankrupt Monday.  It doesn't serve anyone's interests.",Postom,2025-05-02T20:23:49,2
