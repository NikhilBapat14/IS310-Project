"So that whole fucking four year campaign by MAGA and ""conservatives"" about Biden's ""endless wars"" and massive military funding was all a fucking lie. Every. Fucking. Word.",williamgman,2025-05-02T14:13:47,23

"Donald Trump is an ignorant, vile criminal. He is dishonorable beyond belief. He is not for for any office of public trust. He has cheated the IRS of hundreds of millions of dollars. He is a convicted sex offender in the state of New York and 34-time convicted felon for falsifying business records. He has cheated on every one of his wives. He is a draft dodger, not because he has anti-war convictions, but simply because he wanted other people to fight instead. He steals from his own supporters. Every business venture he has launched has been a scam, a failure or a golf course for the wealthy. Donald Trump still has not filed legally required disclosures of his income and business interests. Donald Trump is guilty of using the office of the presidency to boost his own income. In any other time of America, this vile, horrible, despicable man would be in prison. But in the present-day United States of America, the wealthy are free to break the laws that the working people are subject to its harshest penalties. His cabinet is comprised of economic termites, who eat away at the structure of a once great republic. When we fail, I expect Donald Trump and his family and allies to use their ill-gotten authority to blame others and viciously crush dissent. This is not a great country. This is not a republic. This is a foul, dying empire run by weak-minded, poorly educated, hateful, bigoted racists. I am so ashamed. I thought we could do better than this.",Great_Goat_Scratcher,2025-05-02T14:29:14,2
"I would think, nomatter what party your in, you could agree that humanity needs healthcare, education, and clean energy. Trump and the republican administration is destroying this country.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-02T15:19:15,2

"Trumps  military.   One that will provide ultimate protection against the wealth acquired by the upper 1%. They will steal from us, and we will die protecting what they stoled.",thomport,2025-05-02T20:43:17,2

How in the hell is he growing the military budget while simultaneously devolving European defense to the EU countries (and cutting cyberwarfare operations against Russia)? So much for purging waste.,RScannix,2025-05-03T09:50:07,1
"Always was, every time. It's been lies every Republican campaign since Reagan, And it's been the same lie over and over.But Americans keep falling for it because they pretend to be on their side. While every time they win slowly eroding America to carry out their ultimate goal of turning it into a Christian Theocracy. But now they see the finish line, turning America into THEIR American dream and anyone who doesn't agree with it hates America.      And for the undesirables, if they have their way, our battle cry will be ""We told you so"" As we are carted of to the El Salvadorian Auschwitz 2.0     And after North Carolina overriding an election they lost there absolutely will not be another vote. It's gone past the point of no return and there is no peaceful way out of this. Guess it's time for people to start picking their side. Just remember, no matter how much you are told you are ""winning"" history will be the judge. The question is if it will be humans looking back at that time humanity almost slipped past the brink, or if only alien archeologists will be trying to piece together, where it went so wrong.      Will we be resilient, or will we be a warning. Welcome to the Fermi Paradox in real time",Jushara_iiskra,2025-05-02T14:22:22,6
"So still with all the ""savings"" due to the DOGE cuts they will increase the debt by a large margin.  Idiots and imbeciles at work.",CreepyEducator2260,2025-05-02T15:23:12,2
Could not agree more. MAGA has taken this so far out there... There will not be peaceful political way out of this sadly. The voting option has passed.,williamgman,2025-05-02T14:33:47,3
