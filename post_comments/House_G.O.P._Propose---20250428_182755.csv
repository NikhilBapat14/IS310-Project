"Thank fuck I filed a couple months ago (spousal AOS).   Re: Asylum fees. There’s no good way to do this without congressional funding. USCIS is 100% fee funded. Under Biden’s DHS, there was a massive reorientation towards humanitarian and asylum based immigration. These applicants do not pay any fees (generally) and are tremendously expensive as they typically require substantially more USCIS staff time (on top of judicial oversight). As a result, all other applicants foot the bill, so to speak. Fees went up and processing time continued to climb. The majority of asylum applications do end up being denied. Whether you agree with it or not, the number of DHS asylum, protection, and humanitarian-related claims per year vastly exceeded pretty much every single other category. Just asylum alone saw more applicants than spousal, other family, and work based *COMBINED* at just shy of 500,000. This is obviously tremendously expensive and the money has to cost from somewhere. The number of asylum applications has exploded. 2000-2023 average was 90,000. 2024 was 480,000.   For context, it cost $3300+$5,500 in legal fees to file all of my paperwork (I-130, I-485, I-131, and I-797).",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T18:33:48,7

"Coming at it from the perspective of someone who is going through the legal immigration process: The asylum system is causing enormous problems right now and needs to be reformed. Badly.   Asylum seekers currently do not pay fees. They are also the most costly (Ie, requiring the most resources from USCIS) class of immigrant. 2000-2023 the annual average was 90,000 applicants. 2024 saw 480,000 applicants. That’s more than any other immigrant visa class. That’s actually more than all other classes (work and family) *combined*. Approval rates have dropped to around 30-35% and is continuing to drop for myriad reasons.   USCIS is not congressionally funded. It’s 100% fee funded. Without congressional funding, all other applicants are seeing skyrocketing fees and dizzying application times. Between 2019 and 2024, form I-130 saw processing times increase by 100%.  While I’m not suggesting what is being proposed is good, the current system is completely unsustainable. A minority of applicants are wholly paying for the fees of the majority, who are seeing their forms processed at a faster rate compared to those who are paying. Asylum EAD processing time is 2-4 weeks. I-485 AOS EAD processing time is 3-4 months.  It was ~$3,300 to file all of my paperwork. $9,000 including legal fees.   > would have to pay a $550 fee when applying for authorization to work  That is approximately how much I paid to file for EAD ($520). It would just be removing the exemption. This is just the reality of finite resources being need to accommodate hundreds of thousands of people who do not pay into that pool of resources. You either accept this, or let all other applicants continue to pay for higher fees with longer processing times. Keep in mind, the overwhelming majority of green card applicants are also from poor countries. Fees were already hiked drastically under Biden, and processing time continued to spiral out of control.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T18:49:14,-6

"But the government somehow has plenty of money to detain harmless people for indefinite amounts of time, such as Rumeysa Ozturk for example, plus the people who are being detained in El Salvador, paid for by us. And somehow there's money to deport harmless people, like the moms who were recently deported along with their US citizen children.  This money is being wasted on detentions and deportations of people who aren't causing any harm and could be working and contributing to their communities and the economy. But no, we're instead detaining and deporting people, which costs money. And we're now going to charge asylum seekers, many of whom barely have any money and won't be able to afford the fees.  The system is broken, sure. But charging asylum seekers is not an honest attempt to fix it. It's a way to keep them out. And it's not necessary. The government somehow always finds money for the things it *wants* to do.",sachiprecious,2025-04-28T19:29:43,8

"I get where you’re coming from, but it will never, ever pass. USCIS is fee funded. ICE is not. Whether you agree with it or not, that’s the way it is. One takes taxpayer money, the other doesn’t. However much the US government decides to spend on enforcement matters not to me in terms of however much I had to pay to apply for my green card and however much my employers have paid for my work visas. Different funds entirely.   Congress would have to approve funds for USCIS, which has never happened beyond very small appropriations for e-verify (which is really just a branch of enforcement anyway).",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-04-28T19:34:46,-1
"Companies requesting H-1B (et al) hires and individuals coming into the United States to work should pay fees in order to offset the cost of immigration and monitoring.   But the US is required by treaty to accept with asylum seekers, many of whom arrive with no resources whatsoever having fled environmental, economic, and political hardships.   It is patently ridiculous to expect these two groups to support the same cost structure. It is a violation of federal law and international treaty to turn away asylum seekers because they do not have the money to pay to file for filing asylum requests.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-04-29T00:23:14,4
