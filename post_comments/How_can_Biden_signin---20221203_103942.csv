"[This article](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/weve-probably-averted-a-rail-strike-now-what#:~:text=It's%20pretty%20likely%20that%20the,But%20it%20would%20be%20illegal) answers that question for you. Because Congress has the authority under the Railway Labor Act to enforce an agreement, once Biden signed the legislation into law, it becomes binding. Workers can indeed still strike if they wanted to, but it would then be considered illegal, and the railway companies would quickly get the courts to enforce the law. As the article notes, unions could face major fines if they went ahead with a strike, and workers could lose their jobs.  The article also notes that this is similar to the air traffic controller strike in the 1980s, when Reagan fired all striking controllers and barred them from ever coming back. Once a strike becomes illegal, workers and unions can pay a serious price if they go ahead with a strike anyway.",KaesekopfNW,2022-12-03T14:50:50,53
">What's stopping the workers from still not showing up to work and picketing and all that until they get the number of sick days they want?  Technically nothing. The workers can still go on strike, it will just be ""illegal"", thus the Gov can send in the cops/etc to break up the *illegal protest,* hire scabs, what ever he deems nessasary.  Reagan infamously broke the Air Traffic Controller Strike by firing the majority of them and using what ever means he could to fill in the gaps.  But you question hits at a key issue of, well ALL LAWS in general. How does one   >actually enforce, well...anything?  With force, the Cops, FBI, The Military, etc.",Heckle_Jeckle,2022-12-03T15:26:40,29
"The bill allows the rail bosses to call the cops on the workers and take them to jail and/or to commit violence against them.  Biden and congress just made our rail workers into slaves as long as they want to keep their jobs.  Or they can just quit.  There's no federal govt branch or subsidiary that has the locomotive engineers and conductors needed to ""break the strike"" like the military reserves did for the air traffic controller strike.  Engineers and Conductors: Just quit. They don't have a plan. You'll win.",expo1001,2022-12-03T17:12:29,7
"It is obviously going to cause train derailments and kill people if railway workers can’t get paid time off for illness. That’s just plain stupid.   A similar situation happened when air traffic controllers went on strike for better radar equipment and shifts less than 90 hours a week to prevent air disasters. So Reagan fired them all.   > [Looking Back On When President Reagan Fired The Air Traffic Controllers](https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1025018833/looking-back-on-when-president-reagan-fired-air-traffic-controllers)  Reagan kept air traffic moving by ordering military personnel, with air traffic control experience to take over, violating the Posse Comatatus Act.   > [posse comitatus](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/posse_comitatus)  The only difference in this case is that railroads are privately owned and air traffic controllers are government employees.",nanoatzin,2022-12-03T15:46:46,3

"I'm very skeptical they'll be able to replace everyone if this happens, I don't think them striking will be quite as easy to resolve as people are talking about.  The companies are already desperate for people, they're not going to rehire all their stuff.",Tripanes,2022-12-03T18:54:50,20
"It should be noted that the 1981 strike was absolutely *devastating* to the cause of labor. That strike helped move the public in a very anti-labor direction for at least 3 decades. So much of the hole labor is digging out of is because workers' rights were generally unsupported since that action. The article's mention of the public being more pro-union than it has been in decades doesn't really connect these dots, but one of the reasons the low dipped so heavily was because any time folks mentioned anything labor-related for the past few decades, the FIRST thing mentioned is the 1981 strike.  For example, my father studied cooking in college and is a trained chef. He spent most of his early career in hotels, mostly in union environments, but usually on the side of management, not labor. My whole life, whenever it came up, he would say he's not anti-union...as long as the union is willing to actually work with the business effectively. He would often then continue on to explain examples of bad unions, often mentioning the 1981strike. As I was growing up, this seemed like an incredibly reasonable take--both business and workers should be cooperating, right? I actually did a little dabbling in political roles shortly after graduating, after I worked in a hotel myself, and when I went for an interview with a labor union, I asked him for some advice. I didn't even realize how badly I was missing the interview until they started explaining the role was about being a partisan for labor. I literally would call myself pro-union while taking stances that were extremely anti-labor.  This isn't terribly uncommon. Many folks have derided the corporatist nature of American politics in recent decades, but the reason that turn has taken is because voters reward it. Sure, this article points out that labor union support is very high, but it ignores that this strike is still *massively* unpopular: [https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-lobbying/3752027-us-voters-want-to-avoid-rail-shutdown-at-all-costs-poll/](https://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-lobbying/3752027-us-voters-want-to-avoid-rail-shutdown-at-all-costs-poll/)  Simply put, it's really not surprising that the Dems folded on this situation. The specifics of this dispute are frighteningly close to the 1981 situation which was a devastating defeat for labor. The Dems have had no problem fighting winnable battles on behalf of labor--just this past year, we saw the Dems join labor's cause in disputes at John Deere, Kellogg, and MLB, all of which were resolved in a much more labor-friendly direction than we've seen in a long, long time.",mormagils,2022-12-05T09:51:51,6

"But say they chose to just stay home instead of picketing outside. I get that the cops could come and break up or even arrest illegal protesters but what if the strike was just no one showing up? Surely they can't arrest people for staying home and not going to work, right? It'd have the same consequences of the railways being unable to operate if no one is there and even if they could hire scabs I doubt they'd find enough experienced railway workers, willing to be a scab, to fill all of the jobs or be able to interview, train, and put to work new workers.   How would they enforce no one showing up?",ClutzyCashew,2022-12-03T17:40:48,8

"Yup. Unfortunately, Biden, like most of our elected officials, has been bought and sold. With record profits, the railroad can't afford the sick days pay.?",Swiggy1957,2022-12-03T21:24:14,-6
"No, it costs a lot to train a conductor and an engineer. While the flight traffic controllers was easily broken by pulling in FTC' from the military, I don't think there are any active duty (unless reservists) that are trained to operate a train. The military uses different types of engineers.",Swiggy1957,2022-12-03T20:49:26,15
"Late to the party, but I think it's still worth mentioning that this was honestly a borderline genius chess move and Biden is already foreshadowing why this happened - If trains would have actually been stopped, so short before Christmas, this would have affected almost everyone in the country and their holidays, which would have resulted in a lot of bad blood. Instead of signaling how important rail workers actually are, people would have felt like their are being held hostage, along with the entire economy.   Instead, this move significantly raised the stakes on Biden's plan to ratify mandatory sick days for everyone, including people working for the rails. This automatically creates a ""us"" narrative, instead of making them the enemy. People will also get much less angry when their parcels arrive late, outside of the Christmas holidays. You child not getting their present has a very different ring to it, than people getting their bills a few days later.   All in all, if this plan actually blossoms, rail workers will not only get their cake (massive raises), but get to eat it too, together with everyone, when people get their sick days.   Now, this glosses over the fact that this entire discussion is being had in a kind of disingenuous way, since it's really about sameday sick leave, not the amount of all sick days. But hey, we will see what Biden offered those unions behind closed doors, since the vast majority of them agreed to Biden's plans. If my gut feeling is right, the next decade will be a good one, for these guys n gals and unions will suddenly be seen as a incredibly effective political entities, because of their union with the democratic party.",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-13T15:18:18,4

"And guess who's responsible for it? By the end of 2018, train control technology, called Positive Train Control, was to have been implemented across the US. Almost 3 years later only 45%of freight trainline and only 25% of passenger lines are covered. Gee, you think with record profits, something could be done about that.  Human error is the second most common. This comes from the conductors with little experience, or worse,,with experienced conductors, fatigue.  Third can be reckless pedestrians and drivers. Friend was drunk and got his car hung up on the tracks. I doubt if he was even aware of the train that hit him.  Two weeks later, same crossing, the railroad was working on the tracks. Another friend mistook the railroad worker's signal that it was safe to cross. Both her and her daughter were killed in the wreck. The gates were up, so it was easy to misinterpret. Worst are the uncontrolled crossings.  Crossings with no gates or lights, just the white X sign that says Railroad. Those are the most common RR crossing incidents.   There are other causes, such as suicides, but the number of deaths is roughly 1000 a year.   Knowing that, do you think you could operate a railroad engine with only 6 weeks or so of training?",Swiggy1957,2022-12-03T21:21:30,2
"Right, exactly. The folks opposing Biden's action here are missing that the union almost was 100% guaranteed to lose if it fought, but now they have a chance to build more public support and try to pick a better battlefield. Does it suck that labor was so far underwater in this case? Sure, if you're a fan of labor, I get why this feels bad.

"Reagan had a large pool to pull from. Air traffic controllers from the air force, the Navy, the Marines. Just put them in those spots. Conductors and engineers? Not so much. Military doesn't have their own railroad and the number of reservists they could call on would be minimal. IIRC, it takes something like 6 - 10 weeks to train a conductor and about the same time for an engineer. Nearly every engineer started out as a conductor, and, while most conductors could run a train in an emergency, and often do ""for the experience"" for when they go for a promotion to engineer, there are issues of safety.",Swiggy1957,2022-12-03T20:57:56,4

"Well, it's very understandable. People who are this supportive of unions, probably wouldn't predict the sudden turn of public opinion, because theirs wouldn't change. But most middle-class moderates def value their 'sacred' holiday over the quality of life of a rather small minority. People need to start listening to Biden better, he might talk slow, but he understands the game very well.   I really do hope that people will be able to connect the dots, because this could become a new playbook move for Dems. Getting small concessions to band people together, to then pile those collective interests up to create pressure, has worked out very well for Republicans over the last decades. I am sure they will scream bloody murder, when they realize that what they see as a win now, will turn out to be a double fake-out.

Biden is genuinely a master at knowing when to hold em and when to fold em, politically speaking. He's peerless in that regard. Even in the Obama administration, he was one of the key advisors on putting in the chips on gay marriage when the administration did, and not before, and it worked amazingly as they scored a tremendous and conclusive victory.

"Exactly! It's not something you do part time after school. It is a career and you have to be a professional at all times. I recall when I transported railworkers before I became disabled. Pick Up a crew in Chicago, at the Roundhouse. Got close but a train was blocking the tracks. It wasn't moving! Waited about 15 minutes, called central dispatch. They rerouted me to around the train (no GPS) just as I was getting ready to head over. A young guy came up and introduced himself as the conductor. Engine got a signal that on of the knuckles was bad and he had to figure out which one it was. And then replace it. Okay. I knew the why, made it to the round house, and waited another three hours for them to bring the train in. I hade to drive 10 miles to get to the round house, they had less than a mile.

"Oh, they def do! Sadly, elections are not won by the people who watch closely and while the environment is certainly better, data seems to suggest that the trend hasn't been turned around. Putin's war def put a massive dent into the push for conservatism in Europe, so it would be great to see the US go in the same direction. A labor decade would be a nice suprise.  A big issue for me is probably that I don't live in the states, so it's very hard for me to ""read the room"".. All my input is either filtered through tons of professional analysis already and thus pretty delayed, or raw unfiltered people complaining online and all I have heard here is that clearly Biden is a right-wing hack, for putting those rail workers in shackles.  I honestly don't understand much of Biden's legacy during the Obama administration.. In 2008 I was more concerned with figuring out who orchestrated 9/11 lol But after 16 years of Merkel, I got a much better feeling for how much of politics is about shutting up in the right moment",Original-Aerie8,2022-12-13T16:33:50,2
I really appreciate your insight into Biden. I'm wondering if you could elaborate more on his ability to hold em and fold em?

"Essentially, Biden never really was a big advocate for gay marriage rights...until he pushed the Obama administration to throw its weight behind the Obergefell case that eventually ended up legalizing it across the country. Biden seems to have this talent where he knows *when* to get behind an issue and when not to. He knows how to pick his battles and come out ahead.  Compare this to someone like Bernie Sanders. Sanders is a very talented politician in his own right, but ""I've supported gay marriage for 40 years"" isn't as big a flex as it sounds, because it's basically conceding you've been ineffective at achieving your political goals for 40 years. There's more to it, of course--Sanders is an entirely different flavor of politician so don't take away from this that I'm dumping on Sanders. Rather, I'm celebrating how effective Biden is in expending his political capital to get issues over the hump and deliver concrete policy results.  We see this in a lot of things. Biden accomplished the first gun bill at the federal level since *Clinton*. Infrastructure was an issue for both sides of the aisle. Biden made it his first priority and it was his first legislative accomplishment. The Obama administration wasn't really considering weighing in on gay marriage until Biden encouraged now is the time. I've already detailed how Biden has had officials appear at many strikes over the last year and a half, resulting in a seriously impressive year for labor, even with this recent rail strike prevented.   I forget exactly where I read about Biden encouraging Obama to get involved with gay marriage. It might have been Drutman's *Breaking the Two Party Doom Loop*, or it might have been an Atlantic article discussing GOP obstruction of the Obama administration, or it might have been somewhere else.   Here's an article on it I just googled: [https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/obama-expected-to-speak-on-gay-marriage-076103](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/05/obama-expected-to-speak-on-gay-marriage-076103)  This is how Biden gets so many allies. Sure, there are other guys more aligned with gays for a long, long time before Biden got involved. But Biden was the guy who pushed it over the hump to completion. He knows how to read the room and deliver legislative or other policy victories and rarely supports the wrong side or miscalculates.",mormagils,2022-12-14T16:16:13,2
"Merkel, and Kohl who she learned from, never offered much personal opinion. What Merkel mastered was to wait until a consensus in the population formed, finding politicians willing to work with that consensus when she thought it's politically risky to do so, or sit on it herself to drive up approval. That made her practically untouchable, since she was very hard to criticize, as a political figure. Similarly, she never boasted on the international stage or egged people on, while being pretty effective behind closed doors in pushing Germany's interests.   It's a great example of power politics, without employing open conflicts on any level. It's crazy how she managed to get half of South Europe to call her Hitler, without saying a single controversial word.

"While Merkel enforced internal party lines, she would touch most 'controversial' topics with a 10 foot pole. Those politicians were left alone and got to reap benefits and fallout. She did however use any success to boost the parties reputation, as a whole. She was once asked if she is a Feminist and replied ""I don't want to appropriate the name of suffragettes, I never had to fight that hard"", which allows her do avoid a label conservatives might not like, while complimenting Feminists.
