She does not support workers. Sad. If a democratic candidate is too weak to support workers then they deserve to lose.,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-09T13:34:14,4
"I just want MAGA out of the VA governorship. I don't want Youngkin 2 (or worse). If the candidate we get is Spanberger, I'm voting for her and will worry about about her right-to-work stance after she gets elected. This isn't the time for rejecting all but the perfect candidates, because we'll just end up with another Trump sycophant again if we go down that road. We need MAGA out of VA first, then we can be more selective with our Dems once democracy is ""back to normal,"" if that's even possible at this point.",superkeer,2025-05-09T13:56:28,6

"Lmao. This is what ""vote blue no matter who"" gets you.  Essentially get ready for this (but on a larger scale) if Democrats win in 2028. They aren't going to undo even 90% of the damage Trump has done.   When voters complain why they aren't reversing Trump's actions, they'll either blame the parliamentarian or say some shit like ""give us time.""",walkallover1991,2025-05-09T17:15:58,2
"It’s a case of Democrats learning the wrong lesson. She is probably saying to herself, “McAuliffe lost in 2021 after endorsing repealing of right-to-work laws, so I can’t do that.” That doesn’t make sense. Part of why McAullife lost in 2021 was his initial unwillingness to repeal right-to-work. The “parents have no rights” was a debacle, but an early embrace of restoring unions might have helped him overcome that error. Instead, he waited until summer, which was idiotic because he’d opposed a repeal in the past, and if one is going to change positions, announce it as quickly, as loudly, and as frequently as possible. His demurring or reverting to his anti-union position might have worked in the Virginia of 2004, 2008, or even 2012, but not in 2021. As the DC suburbs have grown, so has the Democratic Party base, and the base *likes* unions.   Since the base likes unions, Spanberger should support them. In the past, she has; Spanberger is someone who cosponsored the PRO Act. She should be embracing it, not running from it. It’s not enough to be anti-GOP if one isn’t showing voters that Democrats can make people’s lives significantly better. Unless she does so, she will lose, because even if her incremental plans are solid, the GOP’s derangement will suck all the air out of the room, so those plans won’t get attention; look at how some very good plans from the Harris campaign were buried by news about Trump. There is no way to overcome that without being a transformational progressive, and until Democrats realize that, they’ll continue to learn the wrong lessons.",Brunt-FCA-285,2025-05-09T17:56:22,2
Totally agree. Maga needs to get tf out of VA and I will be voting Blue up and down the ballet. We can worry about her positions on things after we put her in office.,hazardling,2025-05-09T14:25:43,1
