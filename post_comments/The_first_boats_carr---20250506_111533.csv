"Ironically, most of the US destroyers in WWII were only \~ 2000 tons.  Today, we have ""heavy lift"" ships which can be partially submerged, moved underneath another ship, and then raised to carry the other vessel.  The largest heavy lift ships today can carry over 100,000 tons.  If you weren't concerned about damage from stacking them on top of each other, this vessel could in principal carry 50 such destroyers on it's deck.  Even with 50 WWII destroyers chaotically stacked like logs across it's huge deck, this heavy lift ship would still weigh less than a fully laden 20,000 TEU container ship does.",ASYMT0TIC,2025-05-06T12:47:32,7

"I believe the empty shelves will be empty because refills are not being shipped.  Imagine you have a shelf full of dolls from China.  You sell all those dolls.  Normally you would get more dolls to replace them, but it is no longer economical to ship dolls, so you end up with either an empty shelf, or backfill with Trump bibles from China, which are exempt from tariffs, for some reason.  It‚Äôs a miracle!",rdh727,2025-05-06T14:01:48,6
"Big retail stores cancelled orders in anticipation of consumers being unwilling to buy products with the higher tariffs. They didn‚Äôt want to get caught holding expensive inventory that won‚Äôt sell. So most likely a lot of the stuff that will be short will be things we‚Äôd all choose not to buy anyway but we should anticipate some basic stuff getting caught up in that too. And the necessities (clothes for example) becoming more expense and perhaps with fewer options. On top of all of that‚Ä¶China has intentionally banned the export of some products in retaliation.   I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to see empty shelves right away truly. Empty shelves are a bad look for retail stores. They‚Äôre going to spread out inventory to take up more space, they‚Äôre going to put more of the same item on the shelf to fill it. We‚Äôll probably notice smaller holiday decoration sections and that another aisle that had 50 things in it now only has 30 things but more space is dedicated to each thing. Panic buying will temporarily create empty shelving, but stores will adapt.    If it goes on long enough they may even start removing shelves entirely, spacing aisles wider, etc to hide the missing product. Nobody wants the reputation of being ‚Äúthe store that doesn‚Äôt have anything‚Äù and the tic tok video trend of empty spaces.",bolean3d2,2025-05-06T20:11:25,3
