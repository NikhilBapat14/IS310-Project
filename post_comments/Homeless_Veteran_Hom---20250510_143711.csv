"Trump has always been better for vets. A couple of months after he got in office my claim finally started to get traction and was handled; despite speculation from ""fellow conservatives"" here that the layoffs would further delay it. It was like this the last term too. He puts people in charge of the VA who really care about the mission and drive accountability. Trump has done more for vets than any president we've had since I got out (Obama and Biden). The VA Mission Act was a huge improvement, any vet denying how much better that made VA health care on Reddit probably isn't a real disabled vet.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T15:16:30,10

">but I wonder, how many empty barracks on bases are there?  So, you want to take homeless vets, who are likely suffering mental health issues, addiction, etc.... and put them on military installations. I know, we could stamp RTS on their foreheads to keep track of them there too, right... This is a terrible idea.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T15:23:02,11

"Yep, given how generally difficult it can be to get timely care in the VA health system and how long this has been a problem it's insane we had to wait for Trump to get in office for this to finally get sorted out in an effective way, but I'm glad it finally happened.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T15:48:09,4
"And how about this... rather than just shooting down my suggestion, how about you come up with a better one?",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-10T15:31:07,-2
It also helps PTSD to have safe familiar surroundings as well. You don't think the barracks would feel safe to them.  Also it would not be that hard to convert them to small apartments.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-10T15:27:55,-8
"Also if barracks are so bad, then currently serving military that are there should be going totally nuts right? How dare we put soldiers who are still serving in such a place.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-10T15:29:42,-4
