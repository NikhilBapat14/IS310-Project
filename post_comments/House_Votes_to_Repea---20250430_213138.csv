I will not vote for Perez again as a Washington representative voting on this tells me she would have zero issue with Trump getting rid of the climate legislation we have fought for in Washington state  Edit: The more i see the government undermine climate change and climate initiatives the more i support civil disobedience and corporate Sabotage. Are we just supposed to sit around and take it as they destroy the planet.,sedatedlife,2025-04-30T22:29:28,18
