"By Dan Gooding - Politics Reporter:   A popular restaurant owned by CBS News anchor Norah O'Donnell's husband was one of several businesses targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Tuesday.  Agents targeted Chef Geoff's, founded by Geoff Tracy, in Northwest Washington D.C., along with multiple other businesses, seeking out I-9 employment authorization documents.

So I went on a binge where I watched a documentaries on fascists states rising. The reality is that the line between authoritarianism and fascism is somewhat grey in the sense that how you get to fascism isn‚Äôt the same everywhere. But there‚Äôs always one definitive thing that happens. Violence towards the people. I‚Äôm not sure if what‚Äôs going counts towards that but we are certainly going in that direction. What‚Äôs going to happen if they actually get all the undocumented people? Are these agents going to sit around twiddling their thumbs? Once you mobilize a branch of the government it‚Äôs sort of hard to wind down.   Just a question worth thinking about.,Lava39,2025-05-08T10:11:38,13

"As someone who grew up in a very conservative farming area of the central valley, republican farmers love hiring immigrant labor. Moreso because there are no white people who want to do those jobs -- upsetting billion dollar industries due to racism is some of the dumbest shit. There were zero kids in high-school looking for a summer job to pick strawberries in the 100 degree fields after school. All this is going to do is raise prices of food and add to food insecurity all because of racist assholes",NosillaWilla,2025-05-08T10:08:20,116

"Once in a while I listen to the focus group podcast, and a recent one had Biden > Trump voters on, asking them what their thoughts were on Trump after roughly 100 days. One of the big takeaways is that the average person doesn‚Äôt know what to believe. There are still people who believe the truth lies somewhere in the middle of what CNN/MSNBC and Fox says. And that‚Äôs if they‚Äôre even paying attention. Some people believe politics is so corrupt that Trump is simply doing what all politicians do. They cite these vague accusations of things they heard Biden do and say ‚Äúwell,  Trumps getting payback for all the shady stuff done to his people‚Äù. The list goes on, but the point remains that we are still a while away before we reach critical mass on people being angry enough about what Trump is doing to do something about it.   People are concerned, don‚Äôt get me wrong. Most of the respondents were concerned about the economy because of course they know that will affect them. But there are still too many who believe everything that‚Äôs happening is somehow normal. And they believe it because they can‚Äôt process the reality that we‚Äôre sliding into authoritarianism, and they think democracy will weather the storm as it always has.   Suffice to say that I‚Äôve listened to a few of these podcasts and walk away with even less faith in the average person than I did before. It reinforces the belief that Americans can be trusted to do the right thing only after they‚Äôve exhausted all other options.",Apoc220,2025-05-08T16:06:58,5
"There have been dozens of protests and marches around the country (and in other countries!). But you‚Äôre right that the moment should demand a more heated response from Americans (eg, strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, etc).  What‚Äôs so sad to me is that we‚Äôre not just rolling over in the face of fascist/authoritarian overreach, we (as a whole) very excitedly voted for it and I‚Äôm sure most if not all would vote the exact same way again",gymtherapylaundry,2025-05-08T13:45:57,3

"They've been broadcasting who their next batch of enemies will be. Trans people. Maybe toss all queer folk in with that as well. People with Autism that they're creating a registry to track. People who take medicines for ADHD, depression, and anxiety that they want to send to ""wellness farms"", which might just make up the replacement migrant agriculture workers.

"Racism becomes a drug to people like this. Hell, Hitler was losing a war to half the world and was desperate for supplies and manpower and he still focused large parts of his armed forces and supplies to eradicating the Jews. These are the most dangerous people on the planet. They'll destroy themselves rather than even put their racism on hold. It's fundametalist racism, racism as the highest tenant that drives all other decisions. This makes the KKK seem moderate.",threehundredthousand,2025-05-08T13:07:27,22
