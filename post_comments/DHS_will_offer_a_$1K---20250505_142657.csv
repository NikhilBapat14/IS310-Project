"By MAGA math, if we give each of the 500 million invaders that Biden let in $1,000 each, that'd be like 4 trillion dollars!",Grandpa_No,2025-05-05T14:44:12,8
"Fellow redditors, please commence with the shilacking. Monday needs more comedy.  This administration is so desperate to fulfill promises to racists. It's so disgusting and ironic we're living through this.
