"Alabama wants rapists to choose who will be forced grow and and deliver their baby. And if they refuse than they’ll also be punished worse than a rapist.   Alabama also clearly wants to cut children open to force delivery - since a baby is too small to fit naturally and can rip not only their gooch but the vaginal canal and colon too - if it even fits past their child-sized pelvis that is still growing (and, of course, the pelvis won’t grow for 9 months cause pregnancy in a child stunts their own growth using delivery happens)   Alabama hates women and girls  End of story.   These laws are nothing more than laws meant to punish people with a uterus if they don’t have a perfect pregnancy and delivery   Whoever wants these laws deserves to only drive a car with a finished engine and half finished body - since that’s what they want for women and little girls",ra3ra31010,2025-04-07T17:14:08,1
">But in all other cases, the bill would require that prosecution be handled the same as if “someone born alive” had been murdered. “...The sanctity of innocent human life, **created in the image of God**, should be equally protected from fertilization to natural death,” the bill reads.  The other two major world religions - Judaism and Islam - do NOT endorse these anti-choice beliefs. So then why is it that the religious views of a particular Christian sect are allowed to be legislated into secular law? Why isn’t the religious belief held by Judaism and Islam —that *life begins at first breath* at birth —given EQUAL consideration under the law? Are their religious beliefs not just as valid as those of the christian anti-choice extremists?  The draconian abortion bans pushed by Republicans are clearly NOT based on scientific facts or medical consensus, - nor have they ever been - but rather based on the ""*sincerely held religious beliefs*"" of anti-choice extremists. How is this not a clear violation of the Constitution, which mandates a separation of church and state?  The Republicans abortion bans that criminalize abortions and now miscarriages – and soon next will be birth control -  represent an imposition of one religious viewpoint on the ENTIRE population, undermining the constitutional principle of religious freedom and the rights of those who DO NOT share the christian extremists beliefs.  In my view, the draconian anti-abortion ""laws"" are no more than the Republicans legally-sanctioned crimes against women and against the Constitution, who use their self-serving interpretations of religious texts – just like the Taliban – to oppress women.",haiku2572,2025-04-07T18:31:59,1

Yup. While so many countries and cultures doing steps forward in woman rights and equality…the USA jumped  back to dark age law.     I totally share your view. Pretty sad to see.,Organic-Criticism-76,2025-04-07T20:26:41,1
">*Or maybe we not base any law on any religion*.  Yep, precisely the point I was trying to make, that Republicans in basing secular laws on religion are no better than the Taliban or the Ayatollahs in Iran.",haiku2572,2025-04-07T18:45:08,1
