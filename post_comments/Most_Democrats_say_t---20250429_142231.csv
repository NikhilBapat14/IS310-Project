">Where was the Left version of Doge?  With DOGE, you've got Musk with a chainsaw breaking government.  Executive orders can be issued which instruct those in the executive branch to do or not do something.  So, things like, don't spend your budget, instead fire everyone and shut down the building can be an EO.  That EO can be challenged after the fact in court, and we've seen Democratic members of the House and Senate file those lawsuits as a result.  So what would the opposite of this be?  Biden instructs agency heads to spend money they don't have in the budget because that has to come through Congress.  The money isn't there.  Go open a new building that will deliver whatever social services to whomever... how?  There's no money to do that.  The closest you can come to this would be Biden issuing orders like, ""don't needlessly hurt migrants"" or ""don't enforce the collection of these student loans"", etc... which *he did*, and the GOP filed lawsuits on may of these EOs.  TL;DR: With DOGE, it's easy to issue orders to break things and stop spending money.  The opposite of that isn't a thing because POTUS doesn't have the funds to give.  Congress does.

"Tbh, I think Trump authorizing the military to help police is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.  He more or less declared martial law, which is a week later than that April 20 rumor (where it's speculated Trump was gonna declare martial law or invoke the Insurrection Act around the border on April 20 after a 90 day review).  He'll probably have the military and police arrest protesters, or worse.   I'm pretty sure life will truly become harder once the tariffs come back in July.  Maybe by then Trump will postpone them again.   But yes I think at least by July shit will truly hit the fan.",LocustMajor9128,2025-04-29T23:34:43,1

"Agreed. And the really depressing thing is we win this fight across the board policy-wise, but have made nearly zero attempt to win or even compete on many of these subjects.  Abortion, for example. The greatest abortion reduction programs in the country are Dem run. Colorado's birth control program saved what, $5 dollars per $1 spent and cut the teen pregnancy & abortion rate by half overnight? General population abortion rates almost that high, at least before Republicans defunded the program (I think it's back now)? Ron DeSantis routinely blocks birth control access for low-income residents *and* has stripped sex ed. That man is a babykilling machine. Republicans literally waste taxpayer money to abort more babies.  But like almost every relevant issue in my lifetime, we Dems just completely cede the battlefield when we don't have to and focus our time on things nobody cares about. It's like we're trying to lose and it's so frustrating. I usedta work so much more with political orgs and worked as proper campaign staff a few times, but it just got too frustrating & depressing with the party's insistence on following a losing course despite everybody remotely in touch screaming for decades that our messaging strategy was losing us most of the country.",Sminahin,2025-04-29T20:19:56,1

"From another comment of mine:  > Democrats should be disrupting every Congressional meeting, filibustering every debate, speaking at protests, and calling fascism what it is. They should hold town halls to warn their constituents about the loss of constitutional government, and they should hold town halls in districts where the Republican representative refuses to show up.   The Democrats right now don't have political power, but they do have the opportunity to put attention on the problem.  A key part of making a change in society is showing people what's wrong.  While these kinds of actions may look empty at first glance, they can do a lot to establish that something is wrong, and that people have to make a choice.  If everyone is just quietly going along with fascism, fascism feels like the only option on the table.  Having someone of high profile call it out for what it is and speak against it shows that fascism is not the only option.",trampolinebears,2025-04-29T17:53:24,2
