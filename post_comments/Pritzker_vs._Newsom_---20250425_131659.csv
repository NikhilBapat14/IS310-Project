"Friendly reminder that FDR was very wealthy for his time and he implemented social security-a program that keeps 2/3 of our elderly out of poverty. Pritzker’s legislative actions and rhetoric suggest he’ll be the same kind of president. He doesn’t need donations from corporations which means he doesn’t need to abide by their wishes. He wants money out of politics but understands the playing field is not even. I hate billionaires too, but he’s a great politician. And in 2028 anyone that wants Medicare for all has my vote and rn that seems to be Walz and Pritzker.",Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-25T14:26:25,6

"Newsom threw away any chance of getting my vote with his podcast stunt. He's either showing his true colors, or getting absolutely terrible advice from those around him.

A slimy grifter with deep ties to mega donors who also platforms neonazis vs a fucking billionaire. Why do the democrats not learn anything ever? Neither one will choose the working class over their rich donors.,Hungry_Culture,2025-04-25T13:47:57,2
How about we show leadership by actually standing against the current President's bullshit and leave the idea of being President on the cutting room floor until we're sure there will be elections in 2028? Everyone needs to wholesale reject this horserace bs happening mere months after the last election.,darsynia,2025-04-25T14:09:43,2

Margaret that her once said her greatest victory was moving the Labour Party to her position. Pritzker would be trump winning by getting Dems to elect their own big boned billionaire for president. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-25T14:13:23,1

What I like about Beshear is he's a Democrat in a red state who doesn't fucking run away from social issues. Compared to the post election hackery of Dems like Newsom trying to throw trans rights activists or other social justice movements under the bus.  Maybe if Democrats would fight for their views people wouldn't think they were such flaccid losers.,Pike_Gordon,2025-04-25T13:56:04,3
Newsom has already alienated a large portion of the base by palling around with the reactionary bros recently.  I doubt he'd even be able to pull off winning the CA primary at this point.,KokrSoundMed,2025-04-25T14:11:33,3
I think Andy will most likely be a VP pick TBH as a way to balance the ticket,gopeepants,2025-04-25T14:23:58,1
"I'm not gonna support or vote for a corporate Dem, especially one who is willing to break bread with dishonest racist pieces of shit like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. Newsom's ilk are 1/3 against Trump and the only way to stop MAGA and correct course is to go left. James Carville is a walking corpse, Matt Yglesias is an out-of-touch prick, and corporate Dems screwed Bernie, elevated Trump, and forced the party further right than it already was to suppress any leftward thought to protect capital. Hillary was unpopular, lost the 2008 primary, and ignored the Rust Belt on the campaign trail. Biden lost two primaries in two wildly different decades, including one in '88 where he was the DNC's darling and he fumbled it by plagiarizing a British MP's speech, runs 20 years later and loses even more miserably, and only won 2020 because party insiders encouraged several other condidates to drop out and endorse him, despite his reputation as a neocon and a walking gaffee machine.",papibigdaddy,2025-04-25T16:38:50,2

Highly suggest you watch this [interview](https://youtu.be/l9Llmi16s30?si=GEQbkWhjrEfj5sIx)   Pritzker explains he thinks money should be out of politics but that he needs to be competitive with the republicans to spend money to win. He’s using his money in politics for good. For example the Supreme Court judge race in Wisconsin.   And in regards to the toilets it was a shitty thing to do but legal in Illinois and he paid the state back since,Jellyandjiggles,2025-04-26T12:38:16,1
"He hosted Charlie Kirk, Steve Bannon and other conservative political figures/influencers on his podcast and spent most of the time agreeing with everything they said. His reputation with leftists is irreparably damaged at this point.",Penguin_Sushi,2025-04-25T15:22:19,2
"Seconded, I haven't heard about this and don't want to go searching for any news that isn't standing against the current regime. I don't want my search trends used for more distraction.",darsynia,2025-04-25T14:10:44,0

"I like the part of the interview where he talks about the need to get money out of politics (multiple times), then, goes on to list every effort he's made to get money out of politics.  I wonder what ""shitty but legal"" things he's done that he didn't get caught doing and then didn't pay back because he was caught.  If ""shitty but legal"" is what you look for in your elected officials... again, we are doomed.",Toobin4Tommy,2025-04-26T13:39:44,1

"Yeah, I myself am done trying to do any of that with anyone still associated with the Republican party.   Far as I'm concerned, that well is poisoned beyond any possible chance for relations of any kind, let alone the worse of them like ol' Smallface.   IMHO Walz is the best bet since he'd also mobilize the ""good ol' boys,"" especially in the Midwest, assuming we still have a country by then.",koolaidman486,2025-04-25T14:17:16,4
"It’s because the only alternative centrist democrats have if they don’t try to find republican voters is to embrace progressive’s view of economics. That would piss off the centrists donors. So despite there being a huge pool of voters that want economic change to benefit the working class, the centrists will look for votes elsewhere.",LongLiveFDR,2025-04-25T14:21:10,2
"Trading progressive voters who won't ever vote for Republicans for centrist Republicans who have proven they'll vote for the very tyranny we're currently residing under seems  completely wild as a political calculation to me.  It's also foolish; so, it's well established that Democrats are flaming purists, and it doesn't take much for them to shut down and refuse to fall in line... so what in the blue blazes was he thinking?? (money is all well and good but it feels like throwing this kind of behavior after donors loses more voters than it gains)",darsynia,2025-04-25T14:26:33,2
"They get convinced or truly believe they can win without offering a vision that speaks to working class voters. They truly believe the working class has no other option. Which is a foolish calculus, like you said.",LongLiveFDR,2025-04-25T14:30:24,3
