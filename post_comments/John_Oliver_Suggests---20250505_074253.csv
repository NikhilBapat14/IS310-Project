I would love to hear from a real reporter about the behind-the-scenes pressure brought to bear on them that prevents them from being comfortable being real reporters.

"I feel like after watching every interview with Trump I walk away with the exact same critique: ask more follow up questions, and don’t be afraid to ask the “are you an idiot” questions. When he says something obviously incoherent and stupid, don’t just let it hang like it’s a genuine answer. Ask the follow up. When he gave his Harlem/Harvard mix-up answer, ask him how his percentage of the black vote influenced his choice to strip Harvard of their tax exempt status. When he says he wants to take over Greenland, ask him why the US military should be willing to go to war against a NATO Ally. If he answers a question in an idiotic way, ask the follow up that confirms “are you really an idiot?”",Stillwater215,2025-05-05T09:14:44,185

"I didn’t realize the interviewer was very kindly trying to give Trump the out and move on and not hold him to account for lying.   But Trump wouldn’t let him move on. He said several times that Garcia had the actual letters MS13 tattoed on his knuckles. And seemed to be trying to get the interviewer to endorse this lie. The interviewer was willing to entertain Trump’s lie by saying that was just “disputed”.  Like fuck off man. I get you’re trying to be nice to Trump tontru to get him to agree to an interview with you again, but we have more inportant concerns as a country than your fucking journalism career. Don’t let him do this. Tell him what he said is FALSE. Not “disputed”. We have photos of his hands. Not to mention it’s an obvious photoshop. Photoshopnis generous, it looks like MS Paint was used, no pun intended.   I honestly don’t even think whoever made that image even intended to make it look like those letters were actually on his knuckles.

"The beauty of propaganda (or tragedy, depending on your perspective) is that the Trump cult will simply dismiss all of the facts because they came from an unapproved source: John Oliver. It's a disinformation bubble that can't be broken from the outside. By his own admission, Trump could murder someone in front of millions of witnesses and they would dismiss their lying eyes. It's essentially the grandest gas-lighting scheme every concocted.

" The big issue is that they're trained to act a certain way in interviews. They spend decades in their careers learning how to approach subjects and ask questions, and a big part of that is to never directly call someone you are interviewing a liar. Because they want to hit all the topics they have on a list, so they have enough material to cut the segments into nice little pieces and sell it in an easy-to-consume package.  Usually, the people lying are willing to just nod when the interviewer says, ""that's not the case, according to what we've seen, but let's move on."" Trump can't though. Because he's mentally ill. He sees no material difference between what is true and what is a lie, so he gets mad when you say, ""hey that's not true, but let's just move on."" He needs to ""win"" by getting you to admit his lie is just as valid as the truth. Anything less than agreeing with him is an attack in his mind and he has to fight.",DisMFer,2025-05-05T08:33:02,27

Trump is synonymous with betrayal and even the most softball interviews with zero pushback are seen as attacks with all the unforced errors this moron stumbles into.

"I think that the approach to interviewing Trump is to just make him feel more safe to say crazy things.  Like, if you said “I mean, clearly the people elected you to lead them so you don’t really have to follow the constitution, right?  It’s just an old piece of paper.”, or “A lot of people are saying that you should install yourself as leader for life.  When do you think you’re going to be able to do that?”, or “Very smart people have said that you should be able to murder and jail your opponents.  How will you go about that process?”.",MonkyThrowPoop,2025-05-05T08:45:32,28

"They were talking about this on Some More News, for which Last Week Tonight was sort of my gateway drug. They basically said, every reporter that gets one of these interviews should know it’s gonna be their last interview with Trump, because if they ask any real questions, he’s going to talk about how they’re fake news and bash them afterwards. So why not take this opportunity to actually ask substantive questions, really push when he tries some weasel dick bullshit like he did here (and in every interview).

"There is only 1 time I can remember that a reporter actually used this strategy with Trump, it was during his first term where Trump told Jonathan Swan that he read ""many books, many manuals"" (I forget what the topic was). And instead of letting Trump off the hook like reporters normally do when Trump gives vague, nonsense ""Many people are saying"" type answers like that and moving on to a new question, Swan actually pinned him down on that and insisted, ""What books? What manuals?"".  It was great, Trump was actually squirming because for once a reporter wasn't giving him an easy escape route. It always annoyed me that reporters didn't do that more - especially at press briefings, like when Trump or his press secretary call on a new reporter, why they don't coordinate with the other reporters and insist Trump actually answer the previous reporter's question before they ask a new one.",GeneParmesan1000,2025-05-05T10:03:18,16

This is why hiring managers look at actual skills and job performance.  Even an ivy degree doesn't matter all that much a few years out of college with the exception of likely having a superior network of connections to bypass the standard process.,PencilLeader,2025-05-05T11:46:44,3
"I don't necessarily agree.  On average, better students are going to those schools, but they would have been smarter and successful no matter what school they went to.  Ivy Leagues attract the most qualified students and have the highest rates of Fortune 500 CEOs, Nobel laureates, etc but not because they became geniuses by being there, but because they already were and got concentrated into those places, not to mention many of the connections they already had and/or gained there.  Additionally, they have some of the top published professors there which adds to their prestige, even if they barely teach their own classes (relying instead on TAs).  And they only let in a small percentage of applicants, making them seem (because they are) exclusive.   This all builds a reputation for having high quality people (which is true), but is it because the lectures and homework there are far superior to other schools, which better prepares students for the workforce?",Truth_,2025-05-05T12:23:58,-1
"Can you define ""quality of a degree""?  A CS degree should have (and I believe it does) a specific minimum set of topics and testing levels.  The variation between universities is small enough so that it's irrelevant; if we seek so further separate graduates based on skills we can reference honours programs or postgraduate work or a even a masters.  That's the idea behind the system anyway.  I'm not in the USA.  What objective evidence to people draw upon that makes them so convinced that one CS degree is worth so much more than another?",freakwent,2025-05-06T15:57:56,1

">but is it because the lectures and homework there are far superior to other schools, which better prepares students for the workforce?  Not relevant. The only thing that matters to the majority of people is where you were educated.  Got a 4 year degree from a local college? Even though you took advantage of all their extra facilities and offers it doesn't matter if you're up against someone who went to Harvard and exclusively took easy classes.  They went to Harvard. *Clearly* they're the better/smarter/more well educated applicant.  Doesn't matter if that's true or not, to the majority of the population.",BarnDoorQuestion,2025-05-05T12:40:14,2
"There are some basic things you *could* do to define it. You might look at outcomes, you might look at quality of work produced (which for some professions is measurable). If you look at, for example, state testing, there are huge levels of disparity in education quality despite theoretically having some federal oversight and accreditation process. (A lot of variation is correlated with state differences, as well as the per capita income, and relevant to this discussion, the political leanings of the population.)",coordinatedflight,2025-05-06T16:12:52,1
