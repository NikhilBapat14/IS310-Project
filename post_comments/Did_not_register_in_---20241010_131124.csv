"You could also look into what you CAN do as a, let's call it a resident in location transition.  Some states will let you vote if you bring them a power or water bill along with your ID as long as you sign an affidavit.",Phog_of_War,2024-10-10T17:22:13,13
If it’s pretty recent you moved then many locations are fine with this.  Voting twice in two states is obviously fraud.  Voting once is not a problem.,olcrazypete,2024-10-10T22:26:58,10
"Call local election commission and ask -- do not take some bobo on Reddit's best guess. You most certainly do get to vote even if it is a ""provisional"" paper ballot. Moving within a month or days of election does not prohibit you voting.",Equivalent_Nerve_870,2024-10-12T00:33:59,7
"If you couldnt get registered in KY in time and fully established residency there, you should be able to vote absentee ballot in OH. You dont have to abstain altogether. The point is if you’re a citizen and not eligible in one state, you’re still legally eligible to vote in the other in some manner. Only MAGAts would push the narrative that you’re committing voter fraud.",Own_Entertainment847,2024-10-14T08:35:35,3
According to the Ohio Secretary of State you can only vote if you’ll be a resident of Ohio 30 days immediately before the election. It seems like you’ve moved out of state and are no longer residing in Ohio. Voting in Ohio would thus be a violation of the law.,[deleted],2024-10-16T20:14:05,2
Voting in any place other than where you primarily reside is illegal and constitutes voter fraud. Elections are precinct and district based and even the electoral college is state-based. By voting an election you aren't eligible you are illegally affecting the results in places you don't live.  This style of voter fraud is unfortunately way too common and isn't highlighted enough.,JudgeWhoOverrules,2024-10-10T16:03:02,6
"You can be eligible to vote in multiple states, one state, or zero states. It's all based on the local rules of the states in question. It looks like KY is out of the question if you missed the deadline (didn't verify), so the question is whether or not you're eligible in OH, you'll just need to look into it directly. It's also possible to be eligible to vote in a state in the literal sense (registered), but not eligible to vote legally. For example, if you've moved, or if you've voted in that election in another state. It's unlikely you would be caught if you're registered to vote in Ohio and do so, but if it's criminal, that's obviously unadvisable. It just depends on their rules and your specific circumstance.",SYOH326,2024-10-14T15:21:12,1
"Hey asking the question on reddit is great for ideas, but if you want an accurate answer check with the state you want to vote in.",juzwunderin,2024-10-18T22:27:59,1
"Not for nothing, but your vote is more valuable in Ohio.",sirnay,2024-10-13T08:50:24,5
I think this is likely correct. I would check with the local board of elections in Ohio. The answer may depend on things like when did you move (last week v. 6 months ago) or where you moved to (in state v. out of state) or length of move (temporary v. permanent).,rak1882,2024-10-16T12:34:46,1
Understood! Will not be voting this year then sadly. Thanks for the info!,Timely-Squirrel-5382,2024-10-10T16:05:35,4

"Check with the state whose residency requirements you meet. If you meet the requirements in both states, vote in the one where you actually live. If you only meet the requirements in one state, vote there.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-10-21T10:57:44,1
Not true. You can vote wherever you're registered but only once. You don't have to live in a state as long as you keep that address as your permenant. People often vote abroad. How could expats vote if they no longer live in the US?,WanderingLost33,2024-10-11T21:20:55,8
"He’s lying to you, actually. You can indeed vote in Ohio but will need to register to vote in KY next cycle.",[deleted],2024-10-12T09:34:35,4
