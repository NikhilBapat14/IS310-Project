"They aren't putting this on ""Prime farmland"" but rather the land that isn't good for much anything besides growing grass.  Most ""converted"" prime farm land is being used to make new housing.",GravtheGeek,2025-05-09T10:11:59,7
"Feel free to post this over in r/BillSentinel, where we're trying to focus solely on legislation. We look at what it says, who wrote it, how it changes over time, and what it actually does. No clickbait, no outrage spiral.     Just bills, votes, and the changing shape of the American social contract.",vucubcame,2025-05-09T10:22:50,3
"I sort of agree with you, at least on the new housing bit - urban sprawl is real. In MI, though, there are many prime farm land farmers that sold out to solar conversions. It's a steady paycheck for them while allowing them to maintain a vested interest in the property that can be handed down to the next generation - especially if the next generation is not interested in being a farmer (which is also happening). The cost doesn't fluctuate with the market the same way crops do, the operation doesn't require heavy investment in ridiculously expensive farm machinery (which is turning into another money scam, makers like John Deere have implemented proprietary diagnostic software and charge a high fee if the equipment breaks down - farmers can no longer fix their own equipment to reduce expenses), you don't have to worry about the monopoly on seed suing you if you don't use their seed, and it's a 'hands off' operation since the energy company does all of the work while kicking back a paycheck. In crop farming, the farmer has to put up the money to get the season underway, the machinery needed to get the crops growing, and then get paid back at the end of the season if they get a good yield. If they get a poor yield, they have to rely on some level of bail out to break even (crop insurance payout, subsidies). Solar conversion mitigates that risk.  What I would rather see is getting solar installed to our billions of asphalt parking lots across the country. It creates shade for parked cars and utilizes space that is otherwise dead to the environment.",_C2J_,2025-05-09T10:43:31,2
