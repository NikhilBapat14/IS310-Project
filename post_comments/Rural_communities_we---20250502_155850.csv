How in gods name has this guy not turned everyone off from him at this point? It truly is a cult,hdiggyh,2025-05-02T16:03:42,21
"I guess one upside to this is that a lot of rural people genuinely believe that rural areas subsidize cities as opposed to the other way around.Â Maybe being forced to actually care for themselves will teach them how they are dependent.Â   Who am I kidding. They will find a way to convince themselves that they have it all right, even as their communities fall apart.Â ",eskimospy212,2025-05-02T16:46:49,13
"They don't need the free weather services because, like they've all told us time and again, they don't use any of the services our tax dollars go towards because they don't do free handouts ðŸ¤£  Good luck using your mind powers to predict that hurricane, Barbara. (Barbara, one of my co-workers who believed government had weather control machines just for context.)",Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T16:22:14,7
They wanted independence. Theyâ€™re independent of the liberal money that helped them survive. Too bad they didnâ€™t realize they were the anchor not the boat.,TheWeirdWoods,2025-05-02T18:06:53,5

"Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Florida. I sincerely hope you get all that you asked for in Trump.  Four years is a long time when things go at ""a year a week"" speeds like it is now - wrecking ball going at full speed - tearing down your own house. While you may be cheering it on now, perhaps you won't feel this way after the tenth storm, tornado, earthquake, school shooting, spree killer or whatever disaster.  I predict that there's a non-zero chance you will not survive this (literally) and neither will Trump (literally) and his politics (figuratively).",Mustard_Gap,2025-05-02T16:07:12,8
Where will that money go? Are taxes not gonna be cheaper? Are we going to get a rebate  on the taxes we paidbecause they wonâ€™t be spending it on needs of the country?  The answer is youâ€™re still going to pay the same amount of taxes or more.   We just have less services. This so the rich wont  have to pay their fair share of taxes. It keeps them in a status quo.,thomport,2025-05-02T18:38:42,3

Dude. Are you a hater really. These are super poor towns with lead pipes and crappy systems that ignored for decades.  BIDEN did something about it   Trump the spiteful hypocrite is ruining all that.   Nuance matters.,kalidoscopiclyso,2025-05-02T22:42:12,0
