I hate sounding like a broken record but: *IT WAS NEVER ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION*  They just wanted to have the power to punish noncitizens who reside in the states (legal or illegal) while forcing US citizens into poverty so that every single person on US soil is desperate and malleable to the whims of the ruling class.,Responsible-Pain-620,2025-05-08T12:10:52,43
"##Summary:  Pavlo Mykolayovych Zinkevych, 37, was arrested by Frisco Police on January 2025. He has been **detained by U.S. ICE for over three months**‚Äîdespite holding lawful status and having no criminal convictions.  According to his fianc√©e,he had been out with friends and was driving home when police stopped him for a minor traffic violation and suspected DWI. **During a field sobriety test, officers asked him to balance on one leg‚Äîa task he failed due to a titanium plate in his leg** from a 2019 injury.  A judge set bond at $500 for a misdemeanor, which was promptly paid. But he  never came back home. Instead, ICE placed a hold on him and he was transferred to the Bluebonnet Detention Facility in Texas, **where he has remained since Jan**.  Zinkevych **lawfully entered the United States in 2022 under the Uniting for Ukraine (U4U) program**. Despite his legal status, his fianc√©e says ICE agents threatened to deport him.  **ICE agents asked: 'Do you want to stay and fight your case or do you want to be deported to Ukraine?**'""  At the 2nd hearing, held on March 20, 2025, **Zinkevych's attorney argue that his client was being unlawfully detained**.  During the 3rd hearing on April 3, 2025, **Judge Miles stated she believes that Zinkevych should not be detained. However, she emphasized that she lacked jurisdiction** to order his release.  Despite Zinkevych having a **pending application for Temporary Protected Status** (TPS) and **having established a prima facie case‚Äîmeaning he is not currently deportable‚ÄîDHS maintains that he is subject to removal**.  Judge Miles asked DHS council to reach out to USCIS and expedite TPS but **no actions were taken by DHS**.  Zinkevych's next immigration hearing is scheduled for May 8, 2025.",Aakash7aak,2025-05-08T12:03:35,17

"It's not required to perform field sobriety tests in Texas..... (or most states...)     [https://www.jasonenglishlaw.com/field-sobriety-tests](https://www.jasonenglishlaw.com/field-sobriety-tests)  # Your Rights Regarding Field Sobriety Tests in Texas  In Texas, you have the legal right to refuse standardized field sobriety tests without automatic penalties, unlike implied consent laws for chemical tests. When a police officer requests these physical tests - including the one-leg stand, walk and turn test, or horizontal gaze nystagmus test - you can politely decline. However, the officer may still arrest you based on other probable cause evidence, such as slurred speech or the smell of alcohol.  If you refuse field sobriety tests, the officer may request chemical tests like breathalyzer, blood, or urine tests instead. These chemical tests fall under Texas implied consent laws, meaning refusal can result in automatic driver's license suspension. Law enforcement officers can also obtain a warrant for blood testing despite your refusal.Your Rights Regarding Field Sobriety Tests in Texas   In Texas, you have the legal right to refuse standardized    field sobriety tests without automatic penalties, unlike implied consent    laws for chemical tests.

"Its not even about punishing noncitizens, its just punishment period.  They are a deranged sadistic cult.  They find joy in the pain of others.  They hurt people because it makes them feel good.  There is no reason beyond that.  Causing others pain makes them feel better about themselves.  And when they cause pain it creates a backlash, they can then cry about that backlash and claim they're being persecuted thus justifying more violent crackdowns.  Yes its about racism and bigotry, but above all else its about pain.  They hurt other people because they like to and they can.",StashedandPainless,2025-05-08T12:16:39,24

"He failed the FST - which he didn‚Äôt need to do, so they held him on DWI which gave them opportunity to determine his immigration status.",Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T20:53:39,1
"So if you refuse the test, then they let you drive home drunk?  Are you telling that how it works.  ..   Yes you can refuse the test and that means that cop and prosectors have less evidence against you at that moment in time.  They will still detain you, many arrest you because you are driving impaired.  And they can forcibly take blood tests at the prison or at a hospital.  But they still detain until you are released on bond or able to see a judge.  For most US citizens, you can refuse the test, they will suspect you for being drunk.  Arrest you under that suspicion because you are unsafe to drive.  Yes you would avoid self incrimination on a test you probably wouldn't pass doesn't mean you are free and clear.  Probably release you on bond and some point fight the case in court.  This guy would lose either way, being detained.      For this guy, he doesn't want to be detained and deported.  He could be detained if he refused the tests under DWI suspicion.  But won't get to court because he will be deported.",galtoramech8699,2025-05-08T20:59:22,1
Many people can‚Äôt pass the FST tests sober - you can be sober and fail the FST and they use that failure to incriminate you.  You are not obligated to help them incriminate you.,Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T22:05:47,1
"Correct, but they can still detain you.   You can't pass getting away from DUI by saying ""no, no tests""  Now, will you be convicted in court?  that is another question.  You dont run over signs, hit curbs, get stopped, say NO to tests and they let you go.",galtoramech8699,2025-05-08T22:10:11,1
"Are you being willfully ignorant? This article doesn‚Äôt say that the suspect was or wasn‚Äôt drunk.  The context for refusing FSTs is that you are NOT drunk and you don‚Äôt want them to use the FST to create false evidence. Obviously if you reek of alcohol or otherwise have betrayed your intoxication, the FST is beside the point. The issue is that police use FSTs to build probable cause to arrest sober drivers.",Dapper-Condition6041,2025-05-08T23:45:19,1
