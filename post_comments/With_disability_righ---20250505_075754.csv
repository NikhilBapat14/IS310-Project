"gotta have a decent amount of people who give a shit about us first, even the ""good"" countries dont want us as we dont benefit them. I cant even get other marginalized groups I'm a part of to recognize disabled people as one of those groups. I was told by redditors if I'm going to die anyways from trumps behavior, i might as well ""make my death useful"" if you know what I mean. No one cares about us, we'll die in silence just usual.",Clownsinmypantz,2025-05-05T09:28:32,7
"I’ve fully explained to many groups that any actions that directly impact the elderly and disabled CAN and SHOULD be used as the canary in the coal mine for this situation.  We depend on those around us to advocate and protest policies and actions that harm us, and often cuts to those services happening quickly, quietly, and without large swaths of protests.  They are eliminating HUD protections as we speak, who managed disabled and 55+ affordable community housing that allow individuals within these groups to stay out of institutionalized care.  They are actively expanding institutionalized care and floating that it will be “more affordable” to lock up individuals perceived as being unable to care for themselves rather than providing community based services.  If this administration CAN achieve that for ANY elderly or disabled groups, mark my words dissidence and “alternative lifestyles” will begin being marked as mental illness once again.",InfinitiveIdeals,2025-05-05T10:15:36,5
"A civilization should be judged by the way that it cares for its most helpless members. To me, this means the elderly, the homeless, the disabled, and its companion animals. The US fails all of these categories",pastafarian19,2025-05-05T12:06:25,3
