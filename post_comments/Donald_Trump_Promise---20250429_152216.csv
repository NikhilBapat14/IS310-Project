"Trump's SA 2025 edition.  Btw, for those wondering about all those scumbag law firms that cucked to Trump for Pro Bono work... Here's your answer.",williamgman,2025-04-29T15:54:41,9
"> This program, according to the President, will establish a mechanism to provide legal compensation and pro bono support for officers facing liability related to their official duties.  > Some of the most high-profile lawsuits against police officers occurred during the Black Lives Matter protests when, according to a former defense secretary, Trump asked advisers whether protesters could be shot. This executive order would make it easier for police officers to get legal support in claims against them.  > Other major U.S. law firms have made deals with the Trump administration, agreeing to provide hundreds of millions in pro bono legal services in order to avoid or remove the orders.  This is the same executive order that in a seperate article, Newsweek said ""has increased fears around an encroachment toward martial law.""",snailmail24,2025-04-29T15:30:57,8

"I feel like this is going to backfire though. Instead of bring order, this is only going to hasten the downfall of a collapsing system. People don't like the police now, and the police in general aren't going to be responsible with this kind of offer, so what is the regime's goal?  It's effectively an announcement they have no legitimacy to rule.",ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-30T00:03:21,3
I don't think it's meant to bring order. it's to legally protect law enforcement from liability from confrontations with protestors or immigrants,snailmail24,2025-04-30T00:11:29,2
