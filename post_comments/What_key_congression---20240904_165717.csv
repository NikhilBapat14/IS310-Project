"I think Sherrod Brown in OH was considered to have his seat at risk but polling I have seen leans towards his retaining the seat, same with Jackie Rosen, NV but Maryland Senate seat may flip Republican because Larry Hogan is doing well on polls there, at least last time I checked",Mysterious-Fan2944,2024-09-05T00:24:57,1
"Thanks, I didn't realize Brown was up for re-election. Also, the polling for Alsobrooks/Hogan kind of shows the problem that polls can run into. A 20 Aug poll showed a dead heat between the two and then a 30 Aug poll by a different organization showed Alshobrooks up by 5%. That's definitely a race I don't remember anyone on the news mentioning before, thanks for all of the names.  The presidential race is the big one, but all of the Senate and House races will all shape the government as well.",mynombrees,2024-09-05T01:14:27,1
