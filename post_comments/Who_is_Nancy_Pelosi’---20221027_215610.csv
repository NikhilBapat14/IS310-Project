"She is running against John Dennis.  https://www.johndennisforcongress.com/  In the nonpartisan primary, Nancy Pelosi got >70% of the vote and John Dennis got 10.7% of the vote, barely edging out another Democrat with 10.4% of the vote to make it into the general election. So there's not really a chance for Dennis to win.",ProLifePanda,2022-10-30T10:28:06,4
