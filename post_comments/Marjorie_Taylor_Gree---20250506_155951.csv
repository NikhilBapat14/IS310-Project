"Forgot the specific pollster, but a Kemp-less poll was done for the 2026 GOP primary and she was the clear winner. Same pollster then compared how she'd do against Ossoff and, interestingly enough, she comparatively performs the worst of the entire field.",St1ng,2025-05-06T16:34:57,4

You guys are naive....she wins if she runs... It will be a message to American voters that mid terms and forward results will look a lot like Russian outcomes.   SCOTUS's work is almost complete.   I have to think there are some folks on both sides in the house and Senate that are getting closer to a position of recognizing that their cutting down the giving tree,goderdammurang,2025-05-06T21:49:07,1

"Her winning the Georgia GOP Senate primary would be a gift to the Dems.   Ossoff is vulnerable against almost any non-crackpot GOP candidate, but he beats MGT by double-digits.",direwolf71,2025-05-06T16:24:28,24
She‚Äôs been re-elected to her district before. She can probably win re-election in her district. Doubtful she‚Äôll win a senate race,mightcommentsometime,2025-05-06T16:48:08,8
"That‚Äôs a weird way to say she has won 3 elections in a row by a wide margin in her district.¬†  She is popular with maga republicans. She will win her next primary for her house seat if she runs.¬†  Then she will win the general because low information voters will see the R next to her name.¬†  What she can‚Äôt win is a statewide race, especially not in the current climate.¬†",aaprillaman,2025-05-06T18:04:59,4

"He could absolutely defeat Large Marge easily, however, Ossoff is in a really good position just in general. Early polling shows him leading every likely Republican opponent except for Kemp.

Yup I'm hoping she runs if she still wins whatever it means we are beyond fucked which we are already there anyway,redditlvlanalysis,2025-05-06T17:33:16,5
He ist though. He has a healthy lead against all candidates not named Brian Kemp.  You can search for the AJC poll from a few days ago.  Ossoff even leads Brad Raffensberger by 9%,LugubriousFootballer,2025-05-06T18:00:46,4
