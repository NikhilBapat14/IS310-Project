"Anyone have a list of Fox's ""devastating polls"" about Trump over the years..? Every single one of their talking heads will be rallying for Trump over the next few days for cover. The online comment sections are turned off for discussion about the poll. The propaganda machine is working as designed. The oligarchs behind Fox just want Trump to tone down the China tariffs. That's all. The Nazi stuff is still fair game for them.",williamgman,2025-04-24T13:04:23,8
">Trump alleged in a Truth Social post that the 94-year-old media mogul, who owns the reliably right-leaning network, “has told me for years that he is going to get rid of his FoxNews, Trump Hating, Fake Pollster, but he has never done so. This ‘pollster’ has gotten me, and MAGA, wrong for years.”    >The president also seized on the chance to take a shot at another Murdoch-owned publication, The Wall Street Journal, for its critical editorials about his sky-high tariffs on China.    >“Also, and while he’s at it, he should start making changes at the China Loving Wall Street Journal,” Trump said. “It sucks!!!”",LockheedMartinLuther,2025-04-24T12:25:54,6
