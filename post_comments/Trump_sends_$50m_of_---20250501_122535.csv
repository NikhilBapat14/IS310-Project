I feel so dirty being even indirectly associated with this exploitation.,pet_dragon,2025-05-01T12:29:53,15

"The title says ""sends aid"" but then the article says ""preparing to authorise the license for the export of defense articles"" which sounds like Ukraine is buying stuff.",paletz,2025-05-01T12:47:49,3
Look at that bastard Bessent. What a disgrace this shakedown is. I just hope our next president is a better person & dissolves the agreement.    The shit they pull makes me angry but how they treat Ukraine makes me ashamed to be an American. ,Competitive-Bike-277,2025-05-01T12:39:02,4
"At *least* $50M  >As the deal was signed it emerged that the day before, on Tuesday, the White House had notified Congress that it was preparing to authorise “the licence for the export of defence articles, including technical data, and defence services to Ukraine in the amount of $50,000,000 or more”.   I saw pics of F-16 ADF frames getting sent from the boneyard in Arizona to Poland, wonder if they'll get put into service for the Ukrainian Air Force?",DeathwingAdeptus,2025-05-01T12:31:24,2

"No, he sold them $50 million worth of US weapons... he didn't send them aid. ",StrangerFew2424,2025-05-01T18:59:14,1
"Right?    I remember when I was first hearing of this mineral deal business and it just seems so disgusting and exploitative.  And it's just right out in the open, not even being kept secret in shame.  Like if your neighbor is being robbed and you have weapons which can protect them, but you'll only step in if they agree to shoveling your driveway all winter, and you're negotiating this while items are flying out their door into a Uhaul.  Shouldn't protecting your friends just be what you do for it's own sake?",God_Hand_9764,2025-05-01T12:41:09,5
Just enough to make it look like something has changed but not enough to piss off Putin.,yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-05-01T12:48:07,2
"Probably, but those may be ones Poland bought for this. They have sent quite a few F-16",ianrl337,2025-05-01T12:44:04,3
or 2 drones! clearly enough to kick Russia's ass.,wizgset27,2025-05-01T12:33:33,1
"Oh, I'm sure Trump had passed this by Putin beforehand. Putin probably laughed and responded 'give then 50 million Donald and I will let you build your little B&B in Crimea.'",George_the_poinsetta,2025-05-01T13:56:39,2
"Yep, and to be fair we should have put troops in Ukraine in 2014 when Russia went into Crimea as a deterrent.  He was a great president, but that was one of Obama's big misses.  But the whole world was afraid of what Putin would do with Nukes, that has changed.  We are a world super power and should show it every once in a while.      All that said, we need to take Ukraine's lead on anything involving them. It is their country and their choice, even if we disagree.",ianrl337,2025-05-01T12:48:32,1
Trump has no friends.  Every relationship in his life is transactional.  He has to gain something - usually money - from any exchange.,InertiasCreep,2025-05-01T17:48:34,0
