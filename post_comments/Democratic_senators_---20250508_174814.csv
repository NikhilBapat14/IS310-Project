Democrats should do more then write a letter. So far the Trump administration has ignored letters from Democrats. Wtf,Highthere_90,2025-05-08T17:58:20,63
So our society is once again reminding queer kids that they don‚Äôt want them to be alive. And yet we treat suicide with all this stigma even though wanting to die is actually a pretty logical response to being told you don‚Äôt deserve to be alive. Why is this happening.,Darth_vaborbactam,2025-05-08T23:03:27,9

">Seven Democratic U.S. senators have sent a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asking him to reconsider¬†[eliminating all funding](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2025/04/administration-wants-to-cut-lgbtq-crisis-lines-funding/)¬†to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline‚Äôs LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Services, the federal program that provides emergency crisis support for LGBTQ+ youth at risk of suicide.¬†The letter noted that rates of suicidality among LGBTQ+ youth are much higher than for non-LGBTQ+ youth.  >The letter notes that 40% LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide in the last year and that 12% of LGBTQ+ youth attempted suicide in the last year. LGBTQ+ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their non-LGBTQ+ peers and also face higher rates of depression, anxiety, and bullying, according to The Trevor Project.  >‚ÄúWhile we strongly disagree with the many actions taken by the Trump Administration targeting LGBTQ+ individuals, we believe that suicide prevention should be a nonpartisan issue. Elimination of services that help keep youth alive is reckless, and we urge you to reconsider your proposal to eliminate this lifeline,‚Äù¬†[the letter](https://www.baldwin.senate.gov/download/050725-letter-to-hhs-on-988-lgbtq-specialized-services?download=1)¬†states.  Sadly, Republicans would rather have dead kids than queer kids.      Republicans cheer on queer kids committing suicide. The only place they want trans kids is in the morgue, whether by suicide or by institutional violence. They want to kill anyone who isn't part of their Christian nationalist hate brigade.",southpawFA,2025-05-08T17:52:23,19
I think RFK Jr is probably just fine with LGBTQ kids killing themselves. He'll just grumble some shit about herd immunity and waive it off.,CO420Tech,2025-05-08T22:26:30,6
I feel like I can already here the right saying ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt they just use the regular hotline‚Äù? I feel like it is important to point out the fear of being judged. If the hotline specifically spells out the it is for LGBTQ individuals it can help take out the fear of judgement. I feel like this would help increase the chances of a LGBTQ individual actually trying to reach out and get help. I guess that is the point tho. I am getting the sense they don‚Äôt want us to get help. They just want us to fuck off and die so they can live in their pseudo-morality. Guess I will live just to spite them.,RubArtistic4683,2025-05-09T02:08:12,4

"The reason to have specialized lgbtq+ suicide hotlines is because queer people face a lot of struggles that non-queer people do not, and those struggles play into the elevated rates of suicidal ideation that we tend to deal with.  To be more specific: If a teenager who just got kicked out of his house by his fundamentalist christian parents for being gay calls a suicide hotline, it's probably a good idea for the person who picks up to have specialized training to help talk them through those feelings, as opposed to, say, another fundamentalist Christian who is going to sympathize more with that kids shitty parents.",ShroedingersCatgirl,2025-05-08T20:23:24,29

These Senators are saying ""Yeah if these people can live their lives - we agree that should be partisan - but not the suicide line!""  When is our side going to actually understand that too?  They said what they said in a really crappy way.  The suicide line is going to go away because our side has been really weak in defending us while all of this happened and they chased the votes of moderate Republicans, and they seem to be doing that here too.",LawGroundbreaking221,2025-05-09T05:31:58,4

They should stop cooperating with the GOP.¬†¬†   One of the jobs of the Senate is to approve appointments. On many of these appointment votes Democrats participated. But because appointment votes are determined by a majority the Republicans will always win because they vote as a bloc and they have a majority of the seats in the senate.¬†   So the Democrats should stop participating because their vote won't matter anyway and¬†it just leaves them with blood on their hands.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T08:05:19,3

That's not how elections work.  You know who did nothing?  Our leadership who shoe horned in a candidate past the primary that no one would have voted for in the primary.  We have ended up where we are because leadership didn't get out the vote.    That's how elections work.   We have to get the voters out.  That's how it fucking works.  That's why blue cities have such great voter outreach - because when you reach the people they get out to vote.

We still have Democrats voting for things that Republicans put up.  We should be slowing down every committee.  Senators should be forcing the full reading of bills.
