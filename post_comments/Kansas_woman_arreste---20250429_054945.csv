The ‚Äúabolish ICE‚Äù movement was right all along. Fascist pigs.,tripping_on_phonics,2025-04-29T06:04:53,153
So now we are arresting people for following the F\*\*king process?  ICE needs to be abolished.  Right. Now.,thieh,2025-04-29T06:09:48,144
">""...agents only spoke English and \[Alvarado\] had not been given food or water ... Moran worries that Alvarado, a diabetic breast cancer survivor who suffers from high blood pressure and needs to eat and drink frequently, will have poor access to her medication in detention ‚Äî or after deportation.""     It's really hard for me to believe that \*most\* Americans approve of Trump's (Anti-)Immigration performance.  It was a disgrace for Trump to attend the Pope's funeral, when his tactics have only gotten more grisly since the Pope first condemned them.    He's already rendering US-born children of deportees with no due process.  Things may change when Trump starts rendering ""homegrown criminals"" soon.  Very sad it will have to come to THAT...  America's in freefall.

"They have also exposed that they don't even want people to ""do it the right way"" given that it's now a trend to arrest them when they are going to interviews/hearings for immigration purposes",ATLfalcons27,2025-04-29T06:30:28,8
Arresting almost exclusively those who are going through the legal processes of becoming a citizen instead of the ‚Äúdangerous drug smuggling criminals‚Äù is really fucking wild and cannot be understated. So you‚Äôre rounding up all the rule followers because it‚Äôs easier than finding actual criminals?? Is it because those criminals don‚Äôt actually exist or is ICE that dumb and lazy? The answer is probably both.,sum1sedate-me,2025-04-29T10:37:54,8
"What? ü§î Now people are trying to do the right thing, and they get arrested. So I guess Trump wanted to encourage more people to be illegal since if you tried to be legal, you get arrested.",kupomu27,2025-04-29T06:31:29,7
"This woman is a cancer survivor who has high blood pressure and diabetes. It's unlikely she'll be able to obtain any care for her health in Guatemala.

They‚Äôre doing the old ‚Äúyou won a free item‚Äù trick police departments use to get people with warrants to show up so they can arrest them without having to go pick them up.,Jonas_VentureJr,2025-04-29T07:13:42,5

"They're picking people up at their regularly scheduled immigration check-ins.  But not for much longer: who would go to their next such appointment?  This brilliant move to snatch up low-hanging fruit will result in immigrants abandoning the process and lead to ICE kicking in doors of undocumented *workers*, not gang-members.  Because these cowards are not taking on the most violent ""illegals"" unless it's 20 vs 1.   It is easier to go wrangle up a factory worker in her kitchen, in front of her children, after her shift is over.",subUrbanMire,2025-04-29T06:39:53,59
