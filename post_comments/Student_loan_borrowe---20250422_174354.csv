"Student loan debt is a major drain on the economy, that's why there has been so much focus on student loan debt relief and student loan reform in recent years.  The student loan system in its current form is exploitative and usurious.  Leave it to the Trump administration to do exactly the opposite of what is needed.",capaho,2025-04-22T20:34:22,7
"The whole student loan program is just a government funded slavery racket. The government pockets, the universities pocket, the borrowers face constantly appreciating interest payments that effectively enslave them. This is why if you want to go to college you should either find some other way to finance it or come up with something else to do.",Prestigious-Ad54,2025-04-22T17:52:36,11

"> This is why if you want to go to college you should either find some other way to finance it or come up with something else to do.  I'm only not a nurse now because I haven't figured out a way to fully pay for it without predatory loans. I'm really sort of at a crossroads, in 3-4 years I'll be at a place to go back to school but my options are either figure out a way to save enough to survive off basically no income for a few years or be in debt for the rest of my life.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-04-22T18:08:57,7
