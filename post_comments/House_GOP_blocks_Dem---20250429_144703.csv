I really want to know how people like this resolve their vocal and boisterous love of their Christian Faith with their utter failure to live by it's precepts?  This Moral Orel looking mother fucker really is the opposite of everything he professes to believe in.,Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-29T15:27:19,33

"Well. This will likely make MAGA and some Republicans happy.  But this is going to be yet another point that pisses everyone else off.    You know, in 2024, Dem politicians became real concerned over the idea that Biden was going to cost Dem elections.  And they were right.  It appears that what Congressional Republicans are doing, at least in the House, is seemingly to ensure that Republicans lose in the mid-terms and possibly in 2028 across the board. I sometimes wonder if this is their strategy?  I mean, if the House flips, SOTH Johnson wouldn't have to put up with it anymore, and House Repubs can have the Dems do what some may want to do, but are too chicken to actually do it--stand up to Trump ... at least every once in a blue moon, while at the same time saving face with MAGA.   On the other hand, they seem to be living in an alternate universe.  I really don't get it.  Seriously, I don't.  They are saying that this is just another lefty 'witch hunt', and as I opened with, will work on MAGA.  But, most people are going ask, ""Is there something you are trying to hide?""  Looking into conflicts of interests between Musk and the Fed Gov., in the least, is of importance to the U.S. Also, if true, it could give Trump an easy out --all he has to do is claim that he didn't know.  The risk is that when Dems take control, they could launch investigations that might reveal things Trump doesn't want known, but instead of getting ahead of it and controlling the narrative, they are trying to shut it down, which is not a permanent solution.   Also, only about 1/4 of the population voted for Trump overall, or only about 1/3 of all eligible voters.  This nonsense that this is what Americans' voted for is bullshit considering that only like 1.5% more voters who bothered to vote picked Trump over Harris.  Hardly a landslide and definitely not some magical mandate.",crucial_geek,2025-05-02T12:14:44,1

"Largely because the news starts talking about the laws Democrats try to pass, while their appointments mostly go under the radar. Similarly, little attention is given when Democrats block republican proposals for laws and investigations and so forth.",Zexapher,2025-04-30T04:58:28,2
When was the last time democrats controlled? You might say 2007 but that was instead about 4 months for various reasons.  Supermajority myth. Fox new even called it a mirage. And laughed and laughed that people believed it.   That was the first time since 1993.  Majority gets the power.  That's how it works.,Laura9624,2025-04-30T10:58:15,1
