">Iowa state Sen. Sandy Salmon (R) introduced [S.C.R. 3](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/LGI/91/SCR3.pdf), which says that court rulings are “not laws” and therefore the *Obergefell* decision is “an illegitimate overreach.” It says that *Obergefell* runs counter to the idea that “human dignity is innate” and specifically comes from God.  >  I wonder if the people who claimed we are ""alarmists"" for saying they are first starting with trans rights to bring back sodomy laws and institutionalize Christian theocratic hate have anything to say now, since they were always wrong.

"I lived in Omaha at the time the Iowa Supreme Court legalized gay marriage, well before most states. My memory of crossing over to Council Bluffs with some friends to celebrate at a divey little gay bar remains so bright for me. It’s so disappointing how Iowa has shifted with the rise of MAGA.",Stunning_Put_9189,2025-05-09T18:14:16,4

"The Respect for Marriage Act(2022), i.e. the RFMA, means that Gay marriage is enshrined in federal statute, so overturning Obergefell would do jackshit to it",TzarDeRus,2025-05-10T01:17:44,0
"Gay marriage, sodomy, abortion, and interracial marriage were all protected under the right to privacy.  The supreme court's abortion ruling determined that the right to privacy doesn't exist.  All of those things could easily be on the chopping block, and republicans in Indiana have already stated that interracial marriage being legal or not should be up to the states.  It's going to be more than gay marriage that gets made illegal again.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T15:55:48,18

Religion has always tried to control morality through the use of laws and violence. This is the same old crap the Christian conservatives have always done. They believe its there god given right to force you into whatever current version of morality they Support.,sedatedlife,2025-05-09T16:14:48,5

"The sole value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to [one's perception of] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.   To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those [they perceive to be] on the bottom [of social hierarchy] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.   Conservatives absolutely need an underclass [for society] to demonize and dehumanize in order to maintain [their] hierarchy, and every single one of their policies and rhetoric work to do exactly that. ""Know your place"" is their mantra.",Shido_Ohtori,2025-05-10T12:17:46,1

"The only sort of sane logic I could frame it in is, there is no higher legal authority than the supreme court so they are trying to cement it. Still I can't imagine being so obsessed that even after I got my way I still couldn't move on from a specific issue.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T16:07:51,5
Best believe Christian nationalists want to eliminate it all and criminalize it.     Christian nationalist hate groups like Alliance Defending Freedom have said that they want to eliminate no-fault divorce and bring back sodomy laws.

"I do believe it.  They are absolutely going after all those.  I forgot to mention birth control, not the abortion pill, but birth control was also protected under the right to privacy that no longer exists and we could see states make contraceptives illegal again in states.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T16:01:44,7
"If gay marriage is overturned, it will be b/c of Alliance Defending Freedom. Over the past 10 years, they have filed a shitload of anti gay lawsuits. Many have risen to the Supreme Court, such as 303 Creative. They are radical Xtian nationalist and a designated hate group.

They aren't in the closet but they are jealous. The most hateful bigots tend to be the ones who have a miserable life because of their own bad choices. Instead of acknowledging that and improving things they lash out at others.,TheJadeGoddess,2025-05-09T15:58:34,4

"Yup. I know. I've written countless times about them. They're the worst of the Christian nationalist hate groups. They are the ones responsible for the sodomy laws in Uganda, Belize, and Jamaica.

"Full disclosure I am actually a Christian.  I do completely agree with you though.  I do not want to live in a Christian nation, I want to live in a secular nation.  Religious nations always turn into tyranny.  I truly don't understand how so many people are rejecting enlightenment ideals this nation was founded on.  I understand your criticism of Christianity, I have no problem with it, and welcome it.  I also won't say that people perpetrating this are not ""real"" Christians, because I think that is an ineffective strategy, and is a no true Scotsman argument.  In my opinion more Christians need to speak out against everything that is happening.  MAGA is harming Christianity, it is a movement based entirely on hate, and is using Christianity as a shield against criticism when that criticism is warranted.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-09T16:27:19,6
