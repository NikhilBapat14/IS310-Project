"“He’s a good person.”.  WTAF.  No, he isn’t. Shooting someone in the back when they are getting in their car to leave isn’t what a “good person” does.   The USA is so fucked up in so many ways. He better get an attempted murder charge and conviction.",Limberine,2025-05-06T19:22:04,29
"I'll save you the time. The DoorDash driver was black, and the assailant was white. Welcome to America. At least New York's self-defense law does not include a “stand your ground” statute. And, good luck trying to wiggle out of it using the “castle doctrine.” POS behavior to the fullest.

"Except the racial dimension, this is very similar to another upstate NY private house owner shooting--the one where the owner shot and killed a young woman who was simply backing out of his driveway after realizing she had the wrong address. The perp basically got a life sentence (given his age). Let's see what happens here.",fxkatt,2025-05-06T19:35:29,4
Firearms dealer charged with criminal possession of ...firearms? Don't they teach never to get off on your own supply?,potchippy,2025-05-06T19:31:45,2
Absolutely infuriating. I hope this POS gets his ahole destroyed in prison.,gdg6,2025-05-06T21:03:13,1

"Yeah the neighbor seemed off. The expression she had on her face when she said ""He's a good person"" was bizarre. No, he's not a good person. He shot a guy who's been in this country for a month just trying to make a living delivering food. What about that is GOOD?",MystikSpiralx,2025-05-06T19:45:25,10
He's not a good person. I was a year behind him in highschool. He's been a hot head asshole since highschool and that hasn't changed,billiamgatesesquire,2025-05-08T15:26:48,2
Victim was black and shooter was white you say? Sounds like a presidential medal of honor - MAGA clowns no doubt.,Various_Doubt_8191,2025-05-06T19:18:16,7

"The victim was a recent immigrant from West Africa, so yeah, maybe a cabinet position is in the works. What a sad clown show of an administration we've got on our hands.",According-Pay-7075,2025-05-06T19:29:05,4
