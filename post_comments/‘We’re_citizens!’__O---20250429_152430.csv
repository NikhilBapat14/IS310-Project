"> She said they ordered her and her daughters outside into the rain before they could even put on clothes.  These type of guys get off on ordering little girls outside in the rain in their underpants.  BTW, if you were a big tough guy they'd have to beat you with rifle butts, then kick you once you're on the ground, so they can feel superior, but for little girls forcing them out in the rain semi-naked does the job.",cipheron,2025-04-29T15:29:27,27

Yeah - well more of this is coming.  Remember that illegals make up 3% of the population which means every home is suspect by the new Gestapo.,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T15:26:10,18

A robbery happened recently where the perps dressed up like ICE agents. What's scary is there's no way to tell the difference anymore.,Jenn-X,2025-04-30T10:04:53,1
"And they wonder why everyone hates cops. And on top of this raid, they admitted it was the wrong house, but still said they were keeping their phones, laptops, and cash potentially for months. Why? It's not evidence of a crime. They already admitted it was a botched raid.",GTRacer1972,2025-05-01T13:57:43,1

….and raiding the wrong house is no biggie now because the administration won’t care or punish mistakes so you can be as casual and inept as you want. Mad at your ex-girlfriend? Ask a buddy to raid her family’s house with guns at 2 in the morning for lols.,Limberine,2025-04-29T19:19:40,6
"Yeah, this is seriously just a matter of time before you hear about an entire innocent family being gunned down.    Edit: I'm more concerned about the people than ICE, why I put it that way.",orion19819,2025-04-29T16:05:42,8
The agents went to the wrong house. If there was a warrant from a judge it would have been for a different house/different people.   Why the fuck haven’t they returned the family’s stuff?,Limberine,2025-04-29T19:17:38,7
