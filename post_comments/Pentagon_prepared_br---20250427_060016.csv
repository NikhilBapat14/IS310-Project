"I don’t like that Musk gets to just leave, and go back to Tesla. He needs to be accountable, he was walking around like a gov employee - we should treat him like one.",animalslover4569,2025-04-27T06:56:16,45
Musk is a Chinese agent. He better deliver or xi will shut down all his factories.,IPromiseIWont,2025-04-27T06:08:12,23
"I hope they deliberately put some false information in there, so when it inevitably leaks to the Chinese government, at least they know where there source is.",OnDrugsTonight,2025-04-27T07:05:16,10
Will that briefing be done in the newly created makeup studio there?,The_Jolly_Dog,2025-04-27T06:18:37,5
What the fuck does “china war” mean I keep seeing “China war” does that mean war with China or China’s wars? Wars China is involved in? The current soft war with China? A future real war with China? Can the media speak fucking English?,LordPuam,2025-04-27T09:48:42,4

Might as well let fox entertainment news broadcast as opposed to going to the highest bidder,Far-Set-371,2025-04-27T09:08:29,1
"There's several levels of briefings...how XXXX will be implemented, how XXXX item is used, how XXXX item is built, how to access XXXX item, etc.  It's all compartmentalized because the people using the XXXX don't need to know how it's built, the one's directing the use of XXXX don't need to know how to access it, and the one's accessing it don't need to know how or why it's being implemented.  And yes, over time, and constant use people will get an idea of each aspect of XXXX from above, but because of compartmentalization they still won't know for sure...and that there is the key point...it is all nebulous hear-say until one is briefed on a particular aspect of XXXX  So with that little bit of information...with regards to Musk, he has probably heard wind of XXXX while bouncing around in our government, and the briefing probably would have confirmed the existence of XXXX and then at the end of the briefing he would be handed a stack of papers to initial ensuring he understood that divulging anything he was briefed would put his life, liberty, and loss of money on the table for prosecution...either way, I'm glad he got stuffed before he got access to even that little bit of info.",dispelhope,2025-04-27T12:09:49,1
The headline should be “Musk stopped at top secret briefing on China by Department Legal Team”.  Bunch of assholes.,KJP1990,2025-04-27T08:16:40,23
We get to watch him try to save Tesla while it sells down to pennies.,Illustrious_Entry413,2025-04-27T07:13:48,5
"Absolutely correct. Any Joe Schmoe federal employee or contractor has to be properly cleared, vow to defend and uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution, and continue to abide by clearance rules after leaving their employment. We all know Musk now has copies of a lot of government data. Will he just be allowed to walk out the door with it all? It wouldn’t be surprising.",Conscious-Coyote9839,2025-04-27T07:32:09,4

There are plans the US first started coming up with durning the Cold War. It’s more of a “what if” scenario. We probably have one for every communist country.,HelloTaraSue,2025-04-27T16:13:21,1
There is absolutely no legitimate reason for him to be briefed on these programs. The weird thing is they don't seem to know who authorised it but we can assume Musk asked for it.,boofles1,2025-04-27T07:03:22,9
I will not cry or be surprised if Tesla board of directors fires his ass as CEO,animalslover4569,2025-04-27T07:42:53,5

They won’t. It’s filled with loyalists,aeyraid,2025-04-27T07:46:44,10
Idk I see a future where the govt gives even more money to Tesla than it already does just to keep it afloat. Even if they aren’t selling any cars which they aren’t which is scarier,SnooCompliments5012,2025-04-27T18:36:05,3
