California must implement a state tax on businesses and individuals who benefit most from Tunt's tax-cut giveaways.  KEEP THE MONEY BLUE,Weird-Ad7562,2025-05-08T13:34:34,3
"It's spelled out, but two major refineries in southern California are closing.  From the article this will remove about 20% of the California refining capabilities.  So naturally prices go up.       They are closing for a few reasons, but really comes down to money. California is requiring them to meet strict environmental regulations and to keep stockpiles of fuel to prevent price fluctuations.  Because of these the refineries aren't profitable. It is also because people are using less and less gas in southern California. Not a bad thing overall, but there are consequences for that.",ianrl337,2025-05-08T13:35:53,3
