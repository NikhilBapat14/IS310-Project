" quanÂ·tum tarÂ·iff (kwon-tuhm tar-if) n.   * A hypothetical system of international trade duties whose rates or applicability are not fixed but exist in a probabilistic state or superposition of multiple potential values until a specific condition or measurement occurs (e.g., the moment of customs clearance, verification of goods' origin via quantum methods, or reaching a certain market threshold). Upon measurement, the tariff ""collapses"" into a single, definite rate based on predetermined algorithms potentially influenced by complex, real-time variables.   * A speculative type of tariff calculated using quantum computing algorithms, designed to dynamically adjust based on an extremely large and complex set of inputsâ€”such as real-time global supply chain integrity, geopolitical risk factors, environmental impact metrics, or even quantum-secured economic indicatorsâ€”far exceeding the processing capabilities of classical computers.   * Less commonly: A set of interconnected tariffs applied to different goods or trading partners that exhibit properties analogous to quantum entanglement, where a change applied to one tariff instantly affects the status or rates of the others within the set, according to predefined, complex protocols, potentially used to create highly responsive and interdependent trade agreements or sanctions.",Buffalo-2023,2025-04-12T17:18:24,2
