He’s proven that he can fully manipulate and control our real money so now he’s going to do the same with his own fake money. The corruption and greed is so tiresome.,ahdidi413,2025-04-23T13:04:35,2

"In fact, one of the biggest complaints from the tech bros who switched from Biden to Trump in 2024 is that they DIDN'T get access to Biden from the large donations they gave in 2020.   Chamath Palihapitaya was recently on a podcast with David Sacks, Ezra Klein, and Larry Summers where he explicitly said this.  Then he went on to brag about how easy it was for him to pick up the phone, call the White House, and get one of his friend's businesses exempted from Trump's tariffs.   It's explicit corruption and they aren't even trying to hide it.",Szeto802,2025-04-23T14:07:28,2
