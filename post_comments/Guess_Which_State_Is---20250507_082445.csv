"Florida did something very  cool years ago.  They passed legislation that basically froze tuition at Florida Universities and Colleges.  To raise tuition they have to ask the State and must do a terrific job justifying it.  And apparently they don’t say yes all yhe time at all, actually NO is the answer more often than not.    Yes the schools bitched, whined, complained, and threw a temper tantrum.  But then they lived within that budgetary restraint and something amazing happened - not a damn thing.  Administration discovered how to budget, they found that spending (literally) over six figures for an open bar for a huge administration and educator cocktail event.  They cold back off on student recreation like climbing walls and recreation pools that were starting to make a 5 star resort pool look lame.    And they could, if they tried - offer an absolutely kick ass **education** at the same time. And they did try, and most schools have done a fantastic job.  Florida public universities are now ranked among the top of the nation, while offering some of the lowest tuition in the entire nation.",cliffotn,2025-05-07T10:40:38,22
