"I mean, what the fuck goes through magas' minds when they hear this  They buy groceries, they see this egg claim is bullshit  They buy gas, they see this gas claim is bullshit",ElPlywood,2025-04-24T17:26:37,25
Fun fact: Trump has never been to a grocery store or a gas station. A true 'man of the people'.,Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-04-24T17:40:28,8

"Simple unarguable facts in front of their face won‚Äôt help, I take back unarguable, they find a way to do that.  Just the 2028 cap has a reasonable reason for like 90% of them, they are talking about how he could run for a 3rd therm in the conservative subs right now, and trying to find solutions.  Craziest I have read is some say as long as he is NOT elected, he can run again and arguing ways to achieve this.  Some say, he is trolling, it‚Äôs just a hat. What if he is not joking, how do you know? Is this a reasonable thing to joke about when you are the president?  They forget that the presidents job is literally working for the people‚Ä¶",hewsab,2025-04-25T03:48:43,1

Trump supporters are by far some of the dumbest goddamn people Iv ever had the misfortune of talking to.   After this administration is over they should not have any say in politics. They must constantly be outvoted until their ideologies die out.   That‚Äôs the way forward.,Tiberminium,2025-04-24T17:36:36,9

Some are calling him out on Twitter and even Truth Social but on Reddit it's a bit hard to find. The conservative subreddit bans anyone who doesn't bow down.   Heck I got banned and I've never even interacted with the sub.,Virtual-Pie5732,2025-04-24T18:17:43,2
"I live in a red area, and gas prices have barely changed. I also haven't noticed much in the way of grocery prices changing. I have to wonder if there's a concerted effort to punish blue states while keeping red voters complacent.  I may be off on the food, as it's just my wife and I, and we have never really paid much attention to the prices, but gas prices have largely stayed the same since January, and I can't help but feel something is off.",dbkenny426,2025-04-24T20:12:20,1

"As much as I agree that MAGA are morons, barring people from voting isn‚Äôt the answer.  What we need to do is give everyone who votes like $100-$500 on their tax return.  Incentivize all the fence-sitters to get out and vote and then the sane people will continue to show up and outpower the cultists",RednocNivert,2025-04-24T21:10:44,1

"Oh, no. We *need* them to vote.   The idea is for them to be soundly defeated at every voting event.  An effort that occurs so much that eventually voting in their direction is tantamount to voting for third party - laughably foolish. And with enough consecutive defeats over a period of time, their ideology will wither away with time. Forgotten.",Tiberminium,2025-04-24T21:15:47,2
