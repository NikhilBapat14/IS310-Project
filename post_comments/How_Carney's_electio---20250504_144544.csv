"Carney is an extremely well educated and experienced economist who attended Harvard on scholarship and earned his PhD at Oxford. He was the first non-Brit to head the Bank of England, then the Bank of Canada (where he was largely credited with Canada’s financial recovery during the 2008 recession) From 2011-18, Carney chaired the Financial Stability Board (which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency)   TLDR; Carney’s got this.",__dilligaf__,2025-05-04T15:15:44,26
"Canada doesn't allow convicted felons to enter this country.   If Trump shows up for the G7, we should deport him to El Salvador.",PJMurphy,2025-05-04T18:10:00,6
Carney isn’t a push over like Trudeau. US has a new opponent and he won’t take it easy with Trump.,jediporcupine,2025-05-04T14:48:12,7
"Trudeau wasn't a pushover though. I mean he was one of the few leaders who directly stood up to Trump's tariffs without waffling like most of Europe and the UK did.  Trudeau was unpopular and sometimes made ill advised comments, no question, but there's a lot of revisionist history going on with him now. He absolutely did not shrink from Trump.  I'm cautiously optimistic about Carney but he's not really dealt with Trump extensively yet.",bravetailor,2025-05-04T15:38:20,14
"He talked a good game, and then went groveling at Mar-a-Lago.  Carney won’t do that. He’ll walk the walk.",jediporcupine,2025-05-04T15:39:26,-10
"I'm not sure how you came up with that conclusion. He went down there early on to negotiate in good faith to feel Trump out. It was only weeks later when people questioned the optics of going down there. There were no reports about Trudeau ""groveling"" though.  And if you're going to paint a narrative to make Carney look better than Trudeau, then at least be fair about it. Carney has already made a minor misstep too. Earlier last month he said that Trump showed ""respect"" for Canada on the phone, which was revealed to be a lie as he did in fact do his 51st state schtick in that phone call too.  Sorry to burst your bubble a bit there.",bravetailor,2025-05-04T15:51:49,10
