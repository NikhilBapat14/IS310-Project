That's why they waited until 4pm to do the announcement in the first place.,Ok_Abbreviations_350,2025-04-06T04:35:38,39
I grew up Catholic and now I LOATHE anyone I see with a cross around their neck.  It is becoming a symbol of virtue signaling fascism...  I must be good because I have a cross around my neck...nope...you are not to be trusted.,Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-04-06T06:05:30,30
When the stock market goes up you can bet your ass Fox Propaganda will run 'the ticker' day and night! And the propagandists will never stop their worshipful adoration of the Messiah who made it all possible!,YallerDawg,2025-04-06T08:49:45,7

They’re also going at lengths to hide any stock news or info on the main website. Crazy how the one of the largest stock market dives in recent history it’s trying to be hidden by what is one of the biggest media companies in the world. ,azurite--,2025-04-06T12:01:19,2

I expect a bounce sometime soon but this is common in bear markets.,metskyfan,2025-04-06T12:32:48,1
Far lefty here. Disinformation is a scourge on our society.   I can see how people might be conflicted by this. I'm not immune from the urge to cheer on disinformation that supports my POV. I hate Fox News and everything it stands for just as much as the next person.   But let's be careful not to be duped into believing anything so long as it comports with our views. That's precisely what got US into this mess.,river_tree_nut,2025-04-06T12:45:16,1
"Exactly. Trump's deluded minions on Wall Street begged him to wait until markets had closed for the day.   That didn't help much on the following two days. The DJIA, NASDAQ, and S&P all dropped about 10% since Tariff-o-Rama on the White House lawn.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-06T07:25:47,14

"When they do mention it they talk like this is necessary. I heard one of them mentioning “victory gardens”. I knew they lived on an alternate reality, but I didn’t know they thought the U.S. was in the middle of a crisis equivalent to WWII.",regent040,2025-04-06T12:43:35,1
"Great point. Confirmation bias is a problem up and down the political spectrum. I hold my nose and check the fox gnus website daily and they bury anything negative about trump and amplify his talking points. CNN and MSNBC push their agendas, but at least criticize Dems sometimes. The real left needs a bigger voice, especially with all the weird shit going on with TYT.",5adieKat87,2025-04-06T14:58:22,2
