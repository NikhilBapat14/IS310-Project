"The Orange Twit needs more time. How can he be expected to have a full fascist regime in only 4 months? It takes time to control media, silence the courts and deport all the undesirables. When all goes boom the world will be in a “Great Depression”. China  will be laughing and Russia will have the U.S. as its puppet.",FicklePop3421,2025-04-30T19:11:24,1

Yeah it's entirely self inflicted. Nobody was forcing him to say he'd have everything fixed immediately.,NPRdude,2025-04-30T17:39:06,3
