"I didn't vote for Trump in the primaries and would much prefer another Republican in the White House, but there's no way in hell I regret voting for him over Kamala.",bearcatjoe,2025-05-02T16:20:25,97
"It is worth watching the whole segment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmguOrFuO7s&t=195s  CNN is framing it inside of identity politics (""black Trump voters""), but nearly 100% of what these voters said are the concerns that most Americans have.  Border security, kitchen table issues, etc. People are people. Most Americans just want to take care of their family and help their community.",Kahnspiracy,2025-05-02T18:37:01,19
"They were hoping for different answers. I'm surprised they didn't just show people who said what they wanted them to say, because that's the journalistic integrity one expects out of CNN.",RandolphE6,2025-05-02T14:37:43,38
"I don't know a single person that regrets their vote, so it's not surprising.  I don't agree with everything Trump has done, he's not perfect, but Harris would have been a disaster.",GeorgeWashingfun,2025-05-02T16:05:37,36
"It‚Äôs literally the inverse of those man on the street interviews. In this case, the interviewer is the moron and the interviewees are all the smart ones.     CNN tried so hard and it blew up in their faces in spectacular fashion.",Ldawg74,2025-05-02T16:44:28,14
Can you imagine if Kamala had won... Yikes,Casty_Who,2025-05-02T17:17:33,7
I have issues with some things Trump has done and said. BUT I have issues with the fact the Democrats have NEVER done anything.  Hell Yeah I voted and had no regrets.,ComputerRedneck,2025-05-02T16:00:19,11
My favorite part of that was the ending cutaway to Anderson Cooper giving his best who farted face.,freeyare,2025-05-02T17:51:09,9

"Once again the Democrats make a desperate attempt to keep themselves relevant, but their ‚ÄúTrump Hatred‚Äù message is losing momentum against Trump‚Äôs multitude of successes.  I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens next as Trump makes America great again!  üá∫üá∏",BerniWrightson,2025-05-02T17:03:47,5
Yes I would.¬†,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-02T14:31:09,6
I‚Äôm shocked they didn‚Äôt do this as a pre scripted segment. Literally shocked. Never would I guess they‚Äôd let this guy conduct this interview then let producers run it for the public to see. Life surprises you sometimes,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-03T07:16:41,2
I have an image of Nancy Pelosi downing a shot and cussing the TV.,bulldog522002,2025-05-02T20:11:51,3
They made it seem as if the only way these voters could possibly even consider voting for Trump was due to ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù.¬†  There is no way these hard working folks would have been able to make up their own minds about who they felt would do the best job running the country *UNLESS* they were fooled by Trump‚Äôs propaganda machine.  This is just another reason public trust in the MSM is at historic lows.  And the MSM just cannot understand why people loathe them‚Ä¶,Freespeechaintfree,2025-05-03T04:22:38,1
The look on Anderson Cooper's stupid face when they cut back to the studio was PRICELESS!,VerusPatriota,2025-05-03T07:57:18,1
"This is the only play they have. Literally pretending that Trump supporters regret Trump, to try to influence people. Manipulating people's perception of reality with utter falsehoods is what CNN does. And nearly every other outlet.  This is a war. A war for people's perception. Instead of reporting news, acronym news agencies engage purely in attempts to convince people to think and believe a certain way, based on a certain narrative, that achieves a certain end goal. It could not be more false, or corrupt.   As bad as Democrats are, they are nothing compared to the pure evil of mass media.",North_Moment5811,2025-05-02T14:18:59,80
But the polls! I make sure to show everyone in my life that they are lying in the media. Anyone with an open mind and open eyes can see it.,Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-02T14:30:56,6
