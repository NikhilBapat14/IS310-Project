"The comments don‚Äôt sound like they‚Äôre alarmed at all.   > ‚ÄúWe pray that in the 13 years that have passed, 12 of which were under the papacy of Pope Francis, that his heart and mind have developed more progressively on LGBTQ+ issues, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude to see if that has happened,‚Äù said Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, a Maryland-based LGBTQ+ Catholic group, in a statement. ‚ÄúWe pray that as our church transitions from 12 years of an historic papacy, Pope Leo XIV will continue the welcome and outreach to LGBTQ+ people which Pope Francis inaugurated.‚Äù  >DignityUSA, a group that represents LGBTQ+ Catholics, also expressed ‚Äúconcern‚Äù with the pope‚Äôs previous comments but wrote in an online post: ‚ÄúWe note that this statement was made during the papacy of Benedict XVI, when doctrinal adherence appeared to be expected. In addition, the voices of LGBTQ+ people were rarely heard at that level of church leadership. We pray that Pope Leo XIV will demonstrate a willingness to listen and grow as he begins his new role as the leader of the global church.‚Äù",peachypapayas,2025-05-09T04:27:34,20

"Sounds like clickbait, and that this is meant to imply that he hasn't changed or grown as a person since...since I'm not clicking the link, I'll ask. Is my assessment correct?",exophrine,2025-05-09T05:14:58,10
My guess is you will find alarming comments from most Catholic leaders in the past. I do not expect much solidarity from any of them to be honest or religion in general.  The Catholic church is not a alli,sedatedlife,2025-05-09T04:31:17,6
It's concerning to see people whitewashing the things NewPope said about NB and queer people.¬† As if things weren't bad enough already for us.,Elseiver,2025-05-09T05:55:39,5

Francis was a bigot and he will be too,VirtualGrey,2025-05-09T05:22:28,-1
That was 2012. Good luck finding someone who didn‚Äôt say alarming things back then. None of us hold those same views today. This pope likely 100% doesn‚Äôt either. Especially after Francis changed how they‚Äôre allowed to think.,ParappaTheWrapperr,2025-05-09T05:03:51,-2

"These comments were when Benedict was Pope, and reflect Benedict's dogma. Popes are chosen in part for their views of how the duties of the title should be followed, but someone with an intense distrust of recent Popes is unlikely to become one themselves.",FullMotionVideo,2025-05-09T05:49:08,7
"To the contrary, they said they hope he's changed but are worried about the possibility he hasn't, which is fair considering he compared LGBTQ+ lifestyles to euthanasia and abortion, particularly since Christians call for and participate in mass killings of LGBTQ+ people   If instead he had said ""Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for abortion, euthanasia, and the Jewish lifestyle"" people would probably be alarmed by that too.   Or ""Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for abortion, euthanasia, and the African-American lifestyle."" That would also be cause for concern.",seriousofficialname,2025-05-09T13:20:48,2
