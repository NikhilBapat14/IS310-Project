"The amount of spending that this would entail is essentially unnoticeable in the context of the overall US federal budget. The US is an incredibly large country with a ton of people and very high incomes; a security detail for a few extra people is simply not something that matters in the broader context.  The entire proposed budget for the Secret Service in 2025 was [$3.2 billion](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/2024_0309_us_secret_service.pdf). That covers all of their activities--8300 agents working on things like preventing threats to critical infrastructure, investigating things like major wire fraud and other conspiracies of international criminal syndicates, and providing security to foreign governments visiting the US as well as the president and their family.  The overall proposed US budget for the same year is [$7.2 trillion](https://democrats-budget.house.gov/resources/fact-sheets/president-bidens-2025-budget-builds-our-historic-progress-house-republicans#:~:text=Toplines%3A%20Deficits%2C%20Debt%2C%20Spending,2025%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of%20GDP), so the Secret Service represents \~1/2000th of the budget (and providing security to ex-presidents represents only a small fraction of the Secret Service budget).",meelar,2024-11-18T10:12:09,22
"Not really. I mean, yeah sure, the budget for taking care of past presidents may go up, but it’s still fractions of a percent of our biggest expense; the military budget. Your taxes primarily do not go to taking care of past presidents. I would be it is a fraction of a penny of your actual tax burden. For example, 2024 had a budget of “5.5 Million for the annual pensions of the former presidents and compensation of their office staff and related expenses“. [source](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/09_FY2024_CJ_FP_Narrative_Final.pdf). In 2023, the US collected $4.5 Trillion, meaning the GSA fund was 0.00012% of the the total collected tax revenue of the previous year. Also the US Budget for 2024 was $6.75 Trillion, so the GSA fund accounted 0.0000815% of the budget.   This isn’t the low hanging fruit or a silver bullet for our budget. And it certainly isn’t a reason to let old, out of touch, technologically inept leaders have final say in a world that is dominated by rapid change and technological progress.",jdbrew,2024-11-18T10:14:54,3

I would just like to mention that the military is not our biggest expense; Social Security and Medicare completely dwarf the DoD budget.,Mad_Dizzle,2024-11-18T12:06:47,2
"fair point; i wasn't thinking of Social Security and Medicare as an expense that could be manipulated. We could choose to spend less on our military budget, but taking care of our seniors and those who qualify for medicare is non-negotiable; less of ""expense"" and more of ""operating cost,"" which to be fair, is a category of expense, so i definitely misrepresented that. my apologies.",jdbrew,2024-11-18T12:15:01,3
