"Gen Z didn‚Äôt expect their breakup with Shein, TikTok, and cheap XBox games to be caused by tariffs. That‚Äôs one way to lose the youth vote.",Kitchen_Bicycle4339,2025-05-03T09:45:11,40
Trump was telling everyone tariffs were coming all the way up to a rally two days before the election.   They should've researched what a tariff actually was instead of assuming it was a magic power Trump had that forced other countries to pay the US to import their own products into the US,Additional-Software4,2025-05-03T09:57:06,14

"*From Bloomberg News reporter Akayla Gardner*  President¬†Donald Trump‚Äôs escalating tariff feud with China is threatening to upend the lives of young Americans who have grown accustomed to fast fashion, TikTok videos and playing XBox.  Those perks were the result of close trade relations between the world‚Äôs two largest economies and now threaten a perfect storm for young consumers already under the stress of inflation and new entering financial independence. For Republicans ‚Äî who just enjoyed their best performance with young voters in a generation ‚Äî the trade war is poised to reverse gains with a demographic that could be key to maintaining control of Congress in the midterm elections.

"To all young Americans: get off social media.   You‚Äôre idiots.   Read news papers. Engage in your democracy by going to town halls.

Everything is interconnected and your naive views, singularly stupid reasons to view Trump in have lead to this completely obvious, completely avoidable, deterioration of the world order for no other reason than to satisfy this infant idiots demented wants.

They haven't even felt the effects yet. The containers from China with the full tariffs don't arrive till next week here at the port of LA. That week will have a 35% drop in traffic.

"I didn‚Äôt vote for him, but the young voters who were paying attention are likely confused by Trump‚Äôs own words, being the master orator we all know he is üôÑ  In a December 2024 interview with NBC‚Äôs Kristen Welker, President-elect Donald Trump stated: ‚ÄúTariffs cost Americans nothing.‚Äù  I paid almost $700 for a new computer drive recently and I‚Äôm now likely on the hook for $820+ in tariffs because it shipped from mainland China.

"Trump  fired a dirty bomb into the U.S. economy. 20 to 40 days for a cargo shipment from China to the U.S.  The orders cancelled today will mean empty shelves late this month or early next month.  The empty ports mean port workers will lose jobs, truck drivers will lose jobs, warehouse workers will lose jobs, retail workers will lose jobs.     If Trump  backflips on China tariffs, it will still be months to restart the supply chains.  The next several months are looking like a hellish recession.",dkorabell,2025-05-03T10:09:39,11
