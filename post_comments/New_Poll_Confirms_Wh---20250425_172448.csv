The problem: Many of those who suffer the most severe cases of TDS are also federal employees.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T05:36:17,2
"I knew it was bad, but I didn't know it was **This Bad.**❗️👀  >The data, released Thursday by the Napolitan Institute, shows that 76% of voters for former Vice President Kamala Harris working under Trump say they will “resist” his plans, while 75% say they would hypothetically disobey, or “do what [they] thought was best,” when given a legal order that they disagreed with. ",GiediOne,2025-04-25T18:11:58,3
"The support numbers aren't surprising, but the amount that would actively disobey orders is kinda crazy. Just because I disagree with my boss doesn't mean I get to make up my own rules. They would not last very long in the private sector with that kind of mindset.",eschwifty,2025-04-25T19:27:35,1
