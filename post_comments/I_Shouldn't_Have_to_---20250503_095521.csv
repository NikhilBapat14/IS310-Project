"I had a student write an essay about how influencer ""journalists"" are the future and how most people will get their news from them moving forward. In her mind, this was a good thing because influencers are more trustworthy because they are beholden to their fans. If they lie, their fans will just stop following them. Influencers are also less likely to be influenced by money, at least according to her.    And she wasn't even that young. Probably in her early 30s.

"There seems to be some confusion. News has and will always be *biased.* Look who owned the media; *of course* they controlled the narrative. Media in the US has been conservative, but more balanced with a liberal perspective in the 60s and 70s. Then Reagan killed the Fairness Doctrine and conservatives have been focused on building propaganda channels that spread misinformation to the benefit of the Republican Party, (looking at you, Fox (not) News!)  There is a distinct difference between bias in the news and misinformation. You can blame traditional, main stream news for bias, but they still (mostly) uphold news standards.

I’m totally fine with influencers telling me headlines. I always look up the stories themselves and read multiple perspectives to make sure I understand what they’re talking about  The real issue is people getting political news from headlines - whether they read them or an influencer reads it to them.

People read the headline (or have the headline read to them) then run off like an under informed Paul Revere to cry the misinformation and unable to answer follow up questions from people who will then take THAT as gospel,whatshamilton,2025-05-03T16:15:19,3

It is part of the overall thrust of anti-intelectualism, where the competence of the journalists is used as evidence of their capitulation.    I think that, for a lot of young people, GamersGate actually shifted them rightward, especially among young men. The whole thing was wrapped up in an anti-feminist conspiracy where ""journalists"" were forcefully trying to change games to make them less appealing to young men.

"Nobody wants to admit they fell for R wing propaganda.   And nobody is denying that Joe Biden was old.  What you're not realizing is you are convinced that normal aging was inexplicable evidence of dementia because you were played. Most Americans are too dumb to realize this, so let me share a comment from a user documenting the history of the ""Biden has dementia"" smear. Not sure if links are allowed so I'll just paste it.   > The problem with this conversation is that you are ignoring the direct statements of Trump and his team admitting that this was their strategy, not speculation, not a theory, but their own words. First, we have established that the Biden dementia narrative started as a conspiracy. It originated on 4chan in 2019, pushed as a meme to frame Biden as mentally weak. Breitbart picked it up almost immediately, running stories about Biden’s ""gaffes"" and ""brain freezes"" long before there were any serious public incidents, and with no medical evidence to support the idea.   > Political meme warfare got laundered into partisan media and eventually mainstreamed—not a diagnosis, not a fact.  > Second, Trump and his team openly admitted that they believed the government would run without a fully engaged president. In 2016, Politico reported that Trump’s advisers reassured donors that Trump would “set the vision” while ""the people around him"" would handle the actual government operations. Chris Christie said Trump would be focused on “big picture leadership, not details.” Newt Gingrich said Trump didn’t know enough to be president, but ""that’s what his advisers are for."" Steve Bannon compared Trump to an orchestra conductor who does not need to learn how to play the instruments. This same idea was revived in 2024, when Ben Shapiro and others said what matters is who Trump appoints around him, not Trump’s personal management skills. They openly sold the idea that a disengaged president was acceptable — they normalized it.  > Third, Trump and his circle openly admitted that framing Biden as mentally unfit was their strategy. In July 2024, a leaked video from Bedminster caught Trump saying, “He [Biden] just quit, you know — he’s quitting the race. I got him out of the race. And that means we have Kamala. I think she’s gonna be better. She’s so bad. She’s so pathetic. She’s just so fucking bad.” The important thing is that Biden had not withdrawn yet — he formally withdrew weeks later, on July 21, 2024. Trump’s campaign strategy documents and ads show that they invested heavily in weaponizing Biden’s age and slips as a central theme. Stephen Miller even called it the “Biden cognition hoax,” openly acknowledging that they were crafting public perception, not responding to facts.  > We have established with evidence that the dementia narrative started as a conspiracy. We have established with direct quotes that Trump’s team admitted the government would run without a fully engaged president. With recordings and public strategies, we have established that Trump deliberately pushed this framing to voters before Biden even stumbled. This was not an organic reaction to Biden’s age. It was a coordinated political operation — created, repeated, and admitted to by the people running it. When the people building a political attack tell you openly what they are doing, it stops being a theory. I am repeating what they said and applying things equally on each side. I think it's kinda funny Biden ended his career with this treatment, he was an ass. I just wish it wasn't to Trump. Hes a bigger ass.
