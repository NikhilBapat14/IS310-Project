"Last month, there were 139 lawsuits filed based on Trump‚Äôs actions. At that time DOJ/U.S. Attorneys‚Äô Offices were overwhelmed. Apparently they fired a lot of lawyers in addition to a huge, sudden case load. They don‚Äôt have enough attorneys to represent the government in all the cases. Since the DOJ cited a case that doesn‚Äôt exist, the attorneys who signed, need to have their law license suspended. It‚Äôs 100% the attorney‚Äôs responsibility to check the pleadings.    I have no sympathy for the government lawyers nor the government. Most cases are settled. If DOJ can‚Äôt handle the caseload, then tell Trump & Musk to stop breaking laws.

"To be blunt:  Maga is stupid evil.  Their ideas are easily disproven. Their agenda purposes to hurt instead of help people.  They don't care about doing anything good. They don't care about Christianity. They don't care about scientific progress or economic development.  They are tired of pretending to be good and want to be evil.  Full stop.  There is not alternative explanation.  I've been pressing everyone I know who is at least on the fence about Trump's agenda to convince me he makes sense.  I keep telling them that we clearly have different values. I do not want to be evil, and they keep saying we must be evil. That people must suffer...

"The engineering field is full of people who scrape by because they were halfway decent in math.   Just like doctors a couple generations ago, people motivated by money poured into the field despite lacking any fundamental talent or aptitude.   A lot of engineering professionals today are reasonably competent at basic analysis, but totally lacking in any synthesis skills. And the engineering disciplines have more than their fair share of sociopolitical imbeciles who think they are financial wizards simply because their retirement accounts are doing well.   Many are talentless hacks with poor understanding of anything outside of the degree field they were spoon-fed as part of their engineering program.  The result is that a huge portion are stuck in the bad part of the Dunning-Kruger curve when it comes to social, political and economic issues and even many technical fields that lack sufficient overlap with their degree program.  This effect is why we historically seen so many doctors who thought they were going to save the world when they got into politics. We will likely see a lot of the same from former engineers after so many poured into the field over the last couple decades.",Tweedle_DeeDum,2025-04-24T08:03:34,1
