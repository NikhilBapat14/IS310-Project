"""The two are both in the U.S. without authorization and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now involved in the case"" - just pointing out to our mass of Democrat lurkers that both suspects are exactly who they want staying in the country.",Merax75,2025-04-27T10:15:24,6

Trying to find a way to victim blame.  You must be one of the fake ones.  Real conservatives don’t blame victims of crime.  There are plenty of legitimate uses for cash.,OzoneLaters,2025-04-27T11:51:25,4

Me. Regularly. $3000 isn’t a lot of money nowadays  Edit: the fact that this has so many downvotes tells me what I need to know about redditors.  Maybe if you quit spending so much time on Reddit you can go out and actually make some money so that $3000 isn’t a lot to you either.  Edit2: Wow. Look at all you financially unstable people.,dottedoctet,2025-04-27T09:57:30,-12
