"Imagine a group of people that are absolutely obsessed with the genitals of children and then imagine a larger group of people clapping and whistling and cheering when that group forces their way into a discussion about the children's genitals.  Someone should really look into these freaks, huh?",HarmoniousJ,2025-05-08T17:03:04,43
">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) and Attorney General Jason Miyares (R) launched an investigation into how a school in Loudoun County is handling a case of three male high school students accused of harassing a transgender student in the boys’ locker room.  >A [February 2025 study](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Bathroom-Access-Feb-2025.pdf) from the Williams Institute suggests trans men experience violence at a higher rate than trans women in public restrooms. Trans men are frequently overlooked in society in the discussion of trans rights, despite statistically facing higher rates of violence.  >Various sources reporting the story claim the transgender student recorded the three boys complaining about the trans student using the male locker room. Video recordings, according to LCPS’ own policy, are prohibited in school lavatories.  >However, [according to WJLA](https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-loudoun-county-public-schools-lcps-gender-identity-boys-locker-room-female-student-policy-8040-president-donald-trump-stone-bridge-high-school-title-ix-complaint-department-of-education-bathroom), which originally broke the story, one of the cisgender male students recorded the video and not the trans student, which explains one reason the boys are facing consequences.  >Seth Wolfe, the father of one of the boys, says his son is being unfairly targeted. Wolfe has sought the help of the Founding Freedoms Law Center — a Christian law firm associated with the anti-LGBTQ+ group Focus on the Family — to represent the cisgender boys’ families.  So, according to Christian nationalists, the victim isn't the child  bullied by 3 boys for simply wanting to use the restroom in peace, but rather the victims are the three boys for daring to have to use a bathroom with a trans person.     OK. And these people are supposedly tough. These guys are so tough that a mere trans person scares them? GTFOH with that!",southpawFA,2025-05-08T17:03:42,25

"There’s an election coming up in VA, which is why the GOP is using Loudoun to raise culture wars again. School is almost over so it’s time to start shit & harass people. Sure, admin has AP & SOL exams, graduations, & summer programs for disabled students to arrange, but fuck everyone else, we’ve got to get another Trump Stooge elected.   “Reporter” Nick Minock was part of the First Trump administration and has served as a GOP mouthpiece ever since. No one in Loudoun takes him seriously, the “parents” who he manages to find for his articles and support are pretty much always GOP political activists.  LCPS has issued a statement that Minock is misrepresenting the situation.  Word in the community is that the “First Amendment complaining” the parent says was “fine” included a bunch of slurs.  “AG” Jason Miyares knows that the student is legally protected from the harassment, just like he knew that LCPS did nothing wrong during the last “investigation.” He loves to use VA tax dollars for campaigning - he’s up for election as well.",irascibleoctopus,2025-05-09T08:10:18,2

"It’s always been an issue made up by the GOP, gender neutral bathrooms are really the only fix to the bathroom brain rot.  There has never even been a single documented instance where a trans individual was caught sexually assaulting someone in a public bathroom. But there’s plenty of instances where trans people are violently attacked in restrooms for being visibly trans or outed to their peers.",Deep_Alps7150,2025-05-08T18:10:45,12
