"In what way? This isn't deciding whether the ban should exist, only if the ban should be put on hold while it proceeds through the courts. This way there's no irreparable harm caused to those affected, because once it's struck down they wouldn't have been removed in the first place. This ruling is rooted in inhumanity and welcomes irreparable harm to trans people. That's the right ruling to you?",SwiftCase,2025-05-06T13:48:56,10

"This is up to the US Supreme Court in the sense that their opinion is legally controlling, but controlling is not the same as *correct*.   The US Supreme Court can make, has made, and still *does* make incorrect decisions. It is a fallible institution. Suggesting otherwise is absurd, especially in connection with an action where three justices disagreed. ",Equivalent-Drawer-70,2025-05-06T14:12:56,8
