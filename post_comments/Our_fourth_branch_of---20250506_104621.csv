"Hard disagree. The news media keeps giving this asshole oxygen, which is why we are stuck with this current dumpster fire situation. This could have been avoided if the news media treated asshole like the idiot he is instead of coddling him.",MARIOpronoucedMA-RJO,2025-05-06T10:52:27,544
Completely delusional to suggest that. Shows an extreme lack of honesty with yourself and others about the reality we're facing and how ugly things are getting and going to get.,Emeriick,2025-05-06T10:59:50,105

This is feel good propaganda for the news media. They are the literally the reason Trump happened once not twice.,Oceanbreeze871,2025-05-06T11:13:12,59
"lol. lmao. rofl even.  Fuck that, the Media is a not insignificant part of why we're here to begin with, and helped Trump get re-elected.  They're ""saving us"" in the same way a 5 year old pulls a fish out of water thinking they're saving it from drowning.",EnkindleBahamut,2025-05-06T11:18:20,21
"OP says the fourth branch will save us, but we are the fourth branch. Journalists, watchdogs, and advocates matter, but they’re not separate from us. They’re an extension of our civic duty. When we let elected officials slide, we give away our power. This is how democracy erodes by, slowly, through silence and inaction.  Trump is not the beginning. He is the consequence of decades of unchecked abuse. Congress and the courts have too often failed to hold power accountable. Real change requires engagement. We must stay active, demand better, and stand with those fighting for truth and transparency.  The fourth branch only works when we understand we are the last line of defense. No one is coming to save us. So save yourself, and save our democracy.",CiegoViendo,2025-05-06T11:47:05,15
"I wish they were saving us, honestly. After 10 years of trump I’m surprised/disappointed that journalists at bigger news platforms (not talking about Faux News Entertainment) still haven’t figured out how to effectively communicate how dangerous this man is. This, plus allowing for the outrageous double standard of solely focusing on Biden’s age, when this guy is also SUPER old and incoherent.   I’m struggling to appreciate the current news landscape right now. Apart from a few brave journalists, the majority of these platforms haven’t helped maintain democracy as well as I expected them to. But, I also struggle to say this because I do not know what the right approach would be either. All I know is, we cannot capitulate to this admin. Democracy is going to be saved by us, the people.",sr41489,2025-05-06T12:14:54,6
Saving us? The media is the most culpable for us to be in this situation. For all of 2024 the same washed trump’s absurdness and delusion and only honing on what could be wrong with Biden. Discussing Biden’s mental ailments is a fine and dandy conversation to have. But to completely ignore the same for Trump was an egregious lack of action.   Now they want kudos? Absolutely not.,The_Beardly,2025-05-06T12:33:07,3
"Completely disagree, the news media is why this guy is President. They give him too much airtime and give him a platform as if what he says is/was as important as the adults in the room. They also never fact check him. The news media is to blame.",MayorMcCheeser,2025-05-06T12:36:44,6
"Our “fourth branch” is one of the major reasons we go here in the first place, and returned again for a second time!  During the first run they gave him free coverage and let him suck all the oxygen out of the room from other candidates all because they wanted the ratings.  During his first term they normalized him in a pursuit of “both sidism” and didn’t push enough to have him held to account for the things he did.  During his second campaign they actively aided him by hammering Biden for things they then let Trump completely off the hook for (age and cognitive decline) and again gave him tons of coverage and normalized everything he said and did.  Now that he is in power, they have barely addressed everything he is destroying about our nation, and if they do cover it, it is in the most benign and context free way possible that makes it seem like what he’s doing isn’t that outlandish or extreme.  They should be doing deep investigations into his corruption, incompetence, and law breaking and shouting from the roof tops everyday about it so the people can’t not notice.  But instead they kowtow while at the same time being denigrated and weakened by him.",Vuronov,2025-05-06T11:38:54,2

"We are the state. We are the country. We are the people. Nobody is going to save us. Journalists aren't going to save us. Lawyers aren't going to save us. Judges aren't going to save us.  We are going to have to communicate in no uncertain terms our disgust and outrage with this lawlessness. As long as we speak in one unified voice there's nothing we can't do.  If those we put an office, choose not to honor their oath, perhaps it is our duty to help them to remember who put them there. The elected representatives of america answered to us. They don't answer to a king or a single man. Speak the truth whenever you can to whoever you can. Let people know their voices matter. Their dollar matters.

"Yeah this is a crock of sh**t.   Looking purely un-objectively, MSM has a stake in maintaining the status quo. It's in their interest for Trump to be in office. This is because it creates ""controversy"" (I would use stronger terms perosnally), and controversy = eyeballs and eyeballs = $$$.   This is not even considering that most MSM operates off of access journalism. It's why you don't see any pushback cause that access would be cut off. With access, you can't drive controversy and get those eyeballs.   It's actually super duper gross, tbh because all the incentives are to play paddicake with this regime. There are hardly any incentives to hold this regime accountable that MSM care about.   I would also argue that most new age media (youtube, substance, Twitter, ect), has been bought and assimilated into one narrative or another. It's began ti crazy hard to find unbiased sources, not oushing a narrative there as well.",OldFaithlessness1335,2025-05-06T13:02:09,2

Sure, substack and blogs can be good if you happen to follow someone who cares enough to be legitimate, but I worry there are more bad actors than good ones spreading news on the internet.   I don’t want to be a downer, but I’m not ready to celebrate just yet. Let’s celebrate when weve purged these unamerican jerks from our govt.",ThriftyFalcon,2025-05-06T11:20:28,1

"On the one hand, I think the entire DC press corp should have walked out when the AP was banned.   And developed mid management sources in all the federal agencies like during GWB.  On the other hand, I think the press should have extended just enough rope — as in these exclusives — to let DJT hang himself with his ignorance, nonsense, and dictatorial leanings, followed by a fact check and scholarly discussion on the pertinent law, science, medicine, history, etc.  Now if the legacy media CEOs weren’t a bunch of kowtowing cowards….",truthinessembargo,2025-05-06T11:05:08,112

Agree on the disagree.  News media has been destroyed in large part due to removing the regulations that prevented cross-market media ownership in the 90's (signed by Clinton).  The mergers and acquisitions that followed completely nuetralized the ability of news organizations to put truth over profits and we are all worse off for it.,JDogg126,2025-05-06T12:19:46,10

"The way I see it, the American news media establishment has largely forgotten what the purpose of journalism is, even if they still employ talented and effective reporters. The political class figured out long ago that if they got them hooked on access journalism, those skills would eventually atrophy and make the media beholden to them, even those outlets not actively collaborating with the current regime.",leon_zero,2025-05-06T16:38:43,2
"Remember back a thousand years ago, when the news media was cutting away from actual coverage of candidates to looking at an empty podium where candidate Trump might be at some point? They've been giving him absolutely ridiculous amounts of oxygen for over a decade now. They covered him because he's exciting _because they're covering him_ and look at where they got us.  And they also move on to the next shiny and stop relentlessly hammering on all the bad things that he's done so far.

"We can't keep blaming media, or giving them any credit either...  We can't force media to tell ""the truth"", not without welcoming some serious Orwellian shit.

Do we jail liars and hate spreaders? Do we have some sort of psych eval before you can vote?  I mean.... Even if you think that's a good idea, how long until Republicans take control again and jail us for ""Christian hate""?  What the fuck is the solution?

"Yet another bad side effect of letting big corporations merge into ever bigger mega corporations - news groups are now profit centers, and just a cog in the machine, and if you don't want the administration going after your big entertainment machine and all your other properties, you find you ""need"" to self-censor your own news division. Bezos buys WP - great, they won't have to worry about money - but then Trump says ""gee it'd be a _shame_ if anything happened to _Amazon_"", and suddenly WP gets instructed by Bezos to only report nice things about the administration.

"We’re past Orwellian shit when the press is in the bag for the dictator and his friends.

"You’re right - blind investments don’t work. This is because money isn’t distributed properly. As a quick example some schools receive a majority of their funding from property taxes. This means that schools in richer areas will have more money available than schools in poorer areas.  Federal investing in underserved school districts can even the playing field and give poor kids a shot at quality education.  Investments can also be placed on the periphery around education. For example investing in free, quality school meals, as well as benefits for parents (like the child tax credit).  If we can fix education to a sufficient degree, our population will be better equipped to fight fascism and misinformation, and make better electoral choices (and candidates!) in the future.  ETA: also if we can reduce the focus on sports, and move it towards academic excellence, that would be rad.",my_mo_is_lurk,2025-05-06T17:13:05,6
