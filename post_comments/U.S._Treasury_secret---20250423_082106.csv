"Clearly he hasn’t read The Art of the Deal.  If you piss off, threaten, bully, and abuse someone you are doing a New York real estate deal with, they pretend it didn’t happen because they are just as greedy and soulless as you are.   But if you piss off, threaten, bully, and abuse a nation and its citizens, they might go along initially, but you’ve convinced them to cut ties as soon as they can.  China plays the long game. They won’t ever trust the financial side of our relationship with them ever again.  Canada is a demonstration of what happens if you piss off a trading partner, and they are a WAY friendlier people than China.",GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-23T08:31:59,23
Turns out fighting your largest trading partner while running trillion-dollar deficits isn’t exactly a long-term strategy 🧾💥,-Serene_Soul-,2025-04-23T08:28:05,14

In 4 months we went from a recovering economy to an unsustainable trade war that only servers to make a bloated orange idiot feel strong for 5 minutes,FlamingMuffi,2025-04-23T09:07:31,3

"Well why would the republicans insist on starting it?????  Why?  Why did the GOP embrace a goddamn trade war we can't win, rattle the economy, ruin or credibility, lower confidence in the dollar, and basically empower a petulant child in the White House, if it doesn't deliver what they promised?  Because the GOP is completely out of touch, and unqualified.  That's why.",DeuceGnarly,2025-04-23T10:10:07,3

Did the Secretary argue vigorously enough?  Did he say „thank you“ even ONCE???,archiopteryx14,2025-04-23T11:15:42,5

"While I agree with you definitely, I think the canada situation is a little more nuanced than people realize. If any other country except the USA acted the same towards us, yeah we'd be mad but not as mad as we are towards the USA. The reason being is solely due to the fact it IS the USA... they are supposed to be our brethren. We are very interconnected. It was a completely betrayal that will take a long time to recover from. ",cynical-rationale,2025-04-23T10:25:08,6
