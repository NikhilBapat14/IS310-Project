"If I were Zelensky, I would not trust Trump at this point. Not because of whatever deal comes about, but because Trump will force Ukraine to repay whatever Trump thinks they owe. That will force Zelensky to sell Ukraine land, resources, and anything else, not to the US, but to Russia. That would effectively make Ukraine a Russian puppet state ",JollyToby0220,2025-04-28T04:41:30,5

No he is not. This is why people think he is still sucking up to Putin.,randomnighmare,2025-04-28T04:45:54,1
"That was probably another assumption from Trump but...  Without addressing the obvious concerns, morally, logistically and strategically, of ceding an inch of territory to brutal imperialists, and assuming Zelensky was willing and able to do that (which I will believe when Zelensky says it and not before), that would require Russia to withdraw from all of the rest of Ukraine, right? Otherwise they would not be ceding only Crimea but a large portion of Ukraine along with Crimea too and for essentially nothing.  So the question would then become, will Putin withdraw from Ukraine if Ukraine cedes Crimea? I don't think he will.",-CJF-,2025-04-28T04:46:20,1
Only way to achieve peace is to get rid of Putin. And I will tell you something else; no democratic government has ever had to declare war on another democratic government.
