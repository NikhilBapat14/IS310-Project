"Yes, it's an unconstitutional overreach on multiple grounds (first and foremost usurping the exclusive Congressional power of the purse.  No, Trump doesn't care.  Yes, it will be challenged in court, and likely struck down.  No, it won't mean Trump just won't move to sabotaging the same entities in some other way, creating a problem in one place faster than courts can fix it in another.  Yes, it's illegal, immoral, unprecedented, and extremely dangerous to our democracy.  No, the courts won't effectively stop it, and neither will Congress. The only agent which can stop Trump at this point are the People.",GeneReddit123,2025-05-02T01:03:16,39

"To the MAGA cult: your time is coming to an end. Trump’s reign won’t last forever, and those of you enabling his authoritarian nonsense will face accountability. We are Americans — we don’t tolerate wannabe dictators or fascist behavior. Cutting funding for NPR and PBS isn’t just shameful — it’s a blatant attempt to manipulate the media and silence independent voices to push Trump’s agenda.",johnnyutah_987,2025-05-02T07:19:09,1

"For me it provides the only intelligent television news service and its opinion pieces are balanced , polite and considered.  No hysteria or propaganda and it does not tell the viewers how to think or mislead them in any way.  It is true , professional journalism and as rare as hen's teeth.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-02T01:18:30,10
sesame street has been funded largely by hbo/max since around 2016 with new episodes airing there first and then later being shown on pbs 9 months later. that arrangement has ended with the season currently in the middle of airing now. hopefully another streaming service will continue the funding,the_atmosphere,2025-05-02T02:33:00,4

"The good news is that Trump is virtually certain to not serve a third term.  The bad news is that Trump never actually wanted or needed that. It's irrelevant, and his talk of it is just deliberately muddying the water and shifting the Overton window.  Trump is already hardly the real ruler. He's too dumb to actually implement Project 2025. He was needed to be the running candidate to rally the magas, but now that his party got victory, his job is done. His privileges are limited to remaining in the limelight, listening to himself talk endlessly, travelling the world on the public dime with dignitaries everywhere bending the knee (regardless of whether it's to him, or only his office), and being immune from prosecution, probably for the rest of his life.  Policy is in the hands of Musk, Vought, and other P2025 architects. And their 2028 running candidate would probably be Vance (if not too discredited by that year), or another choice.  Not only that, but the first few years of P2025 are expected to be especially toxic, until it becomes the ""new normal"", and until American businesses can at least partially restructure around the tariffs. The P2025 architects will themselves use Trump as the scapegoat, blaming early failures to his idiocy rather than to the idiocy of the underlying policies, and offering a ""smarter"" candidate for the next phase. They wouldn't want Trump to run again, even if he could, and the fact he can't is simply a bonus (because it avoids backstabbing accusations, as happened when Harris ran instead of Biden.)  The time to stop *Trump* was over on November 5. Now is the time to stop *Trumpism.* It won't stop with Trump, and it won't stop at all unless stopped externally. It's too late to pretend the alt-right doesn't exist, that Trump is an outlier, that we can just ignore or ""cancel"" it. Per Newton's teachings, to push an object away, you need to be heavier than the object. Otherwise, you are just pushing yourself away, instead.  Neo-fascism is here. It's real. It's in power. It, as of today, has millions of supporters. It will not disappear on its own; it will not tone down its actions or rhetoric; it will not become more ""reasonable""; it will not ""reach across the aisle; it will not expand into a ""big tent"" party - such movements *never* do. It will *only* be stopped through sustained, organized, determined pushback.   And the longer the Left remains fractured and paralyzed, the harder it will be.",GeneReddit123,2025-05-02T05:32:06,1
