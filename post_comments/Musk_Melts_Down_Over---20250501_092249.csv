"Everyone who hitches their wagon to Trump ends up being burned for it.  Just ask Rudy Giuliani, Michael Cohen and the various lawyers who participated in Trump's election tampering schemes how things have gone for them.  Musk may have forever tarnished his career and his legacy.  He has already lost a lot from his short time with Trump.  Pam Bondi should be considering what happens when the wreckage comes tumbling down on her.  EDIT:  Thanks for your responses, everyone.  * I've been trying very hard to forget that pillow guy, whatever his name is, but none of you will let me... * I am inclined to believe that Pam Bondi is going to find herself buried in enough legal problems and bills of her own that she is going to very much regret taking this job.  Presidential pardons won't stop sanctions, civil complaints and state-level lawsuits that name her personally. * Some allow themselves to be seduced by the feeling of being close to power, while others think that they can tame it or get something that they want out of it for themselves.  Bessent seems to fall into the latter camp, believing that he could get the lower tax rates and deregulation that he wanted while never expecting Trump to start Trade World War I.   None of them appreciate how expendable they are before they take these jobs.",I405CA,2025-05-01T09:40:37,4488

"Anyone with common sense knows Musk is crazy and ineffective, but it's really scary that there's a whole board that probably can't see that:  >In a statement issued shortly after the article’s publication Tesla Board Chairman Robyn Denholm [wrote](https://archive.is/o/7wBi9/https://x.com/Tesla/status/1917812113315074055): “Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company. This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published). **The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead**.”   There's a lot of evidence that Musk is a conman who thrives on spectacles, and there is little evidence that he has a logical and coherent vision to bring Tesla out of its slump.  In other news, I walked by a Rivian SUV a bit ago. It looks really nice and practical. Their trucks seem the same way, too.

I was debating between the Tesla Y and the GV60. The Y had better range but the GV60 was much better in every other way.     The week before I was going in to get a lease my work assigned me to a project that would beat up my car for at least a year. So I decided to wait and I will be looking at the end of the year again for an EV and I will go to test drive cars again.     Guess which dealership I will not even consider going to?",alexdelicious,2025-05-01T10:07:25,35

"Scott Galloway has talked about this a couple times. He feels like Tesla is wildly over valued, and the only thing holding that price up is Musk’s quickly collapsing reputation. Tesla might be in a bind, damage control by firing Musk, but endure a rapid price correction maybe well over 50%, or have a slower bleed as Tesla fails to sell cars because their potential buyers are disgusted by them.    Honestly it probably doesn’t matter what they do, that brand is trashed.

"This story really reveals two lies about business for what they are:  >At a Wednesday Cabinet meeting, Trump gushed over Musk, reassuring him that he had been “treated unfairly, but the vast majority of people in this country really respect and appreciate you, and this whole room can say that very strongly,” noting that he has “really been a tremendous help.”   Lie #1: ""You have to have a thick skin to succeed in business.""  A Cabinet-level meeting was held to coddle Musk's feelings because he felt bad after people laughed at him for being an attention-seeking Nazi as he destroyed the US government and consigned thousands of innocent people around the world to undeserved disease, hardship, and death. Tissue is tough compared to this loser's thin skin.   Lie #2: ""Business is nimble and moves quickly compared to government!""  There was talk of people souring on the Tesla brand because of Musk's antics even before the election. And yet even now, the company's official position is that they are doing nothing to rein him in, even after he caused a 71% earnings dive. I live in Japan, a country whose government is famous for dithering, and even here I have never seen a government do as little in the face of such an obvious crisis as Tesla is doing to deal with Musk.",PaxDramaticus,2025-05-01T17:21:14,3

"Even at this stage, an enormous amount of Tesla's share value is tied up in Musk's cult of personality. Tesla is an auto manufacturer worth more than GM, Ford, and Toyota combined despite only having a fraction of the market control those other manufacturers have. Toyota is valued at $303B and controls 11.07% of the global auto market. Tesla is worth $909B and controls 2.29% of the global auto market. In terms of liabilities, it's not even close, either. Tesla has massive regulatory exposure in every market it exists in for everything from workplace safety violations to automotive safety defects. A huge reason for Musk's interference in the U.S. government was so he could shut down the regulatory agencies that were poised to bring the hammer down on his companies for their many, many violations, especially Tesla.  So, you have a company that makes very little, but is valued at many times the value of their competition because of their speculative value as a ""tech company"" (not a car company). When Musk and his slavishly devoted cult of personality leave the company, the speculative value Musk brings to the table leaves the share price, which even this late in the game is **most of it**.

He's been ousted from past companies.  So it wouldn't be surprising.  He's got a track record as a shitty CEO and a general shitty person to work with.  Paypal kicked him out.

"That's literally what capitalism is. It's all about profit. I don't mean it as an insult or as a ""hey reddit give me karma moment"", it's literally the definition of capitalism. Investors pool ressources together, represented as shares, with the goal of making money from the investment. They're the owners and they decide the way the company goes, and that way will be whichever way brings them the most money.   If that means sacrificing workers, consumers, the environment, then so be it. It's not just that they're evil people (I mean, yeah you do have to be heartless to be like that but that's besides the point), it's literally just how the system works. If ""being good"" brings more money then they will do that. Many people cheer on seeing anti-""DEI"" initiatives defeated in shareholder votes, but it's not because its the right thing to do, investors just think its bad for the company.   So long as shareholders have no incentive for the company to benefit all of humanity, both shareholders and workers and consumers alike, then they just won't.

They just don't meet the quality of other brands in the same segments. When they launched, they did have the best electric car on the market. All they have done is change the styling. Even when they launched the model S it was derided for poor quality assembly and interior components. But people bought them because of the brand.  Tesla is still massively overvalued.

"You are thinking about Tesla wrong. It is a meme stock, not a car company (or, for that matter, a tech company).   If you take Musk away and (presumably) the spectacle collapses, what are you left with? The current P/E ratio of 100+ is absolutely ludicrous; for comparison, that number is 7 for Ford and 18 for Google. For the stock to trade down to realistic values, it would need to collapse 90-95% if you treat Tesla as a typical car company and 75-85% if you treat it as a typical tech company. The reality is that, even if Musk is terrible for the fundamental business of selling cars, he is critical for supporting the ACTUAL core of Tesla's value; its unconventional stock price.  Even if you believe that this stock price is transient and will fade over time even while Musk remains CEO, it is still an incredibly valuable asset that can be transformed into something permanent if you act fast enough. For one thing, you can issue stock; this dilutes the company, pushing the intrinsic value towards the current stock price. Or you can do mergers and acquisitions and pay with stock for some other company with actual value.  You say ""There's a lot of evidence that Musk is a conman who thrives on spectacles, and there is little evidence that he has a logical and coherent vision to bring Tesla out of its slump"". My counter is that the board doesn't need to believe otherwise to think that retaining him as CEO is the right call.

If a company isn't making income, the stock price tanking can be fatal - but Tesla is currently making money. i've worked close to some exective level folks at big companies as stock prices tanked, and my vibe was that it sucked for legacy employees, but if they're hiring new executive level folks and offering them pay packages based on the depressed stock value, they don't really mind. If anything, it gives them the freedom to make bold decisions and not care as much about the whims of shareholders.  I'm definitely talking a bit out of my domain and trying to synthesise conversations from people who know more than I do, but I get the sense there's a bit of nuance here when it comes to letting the stock price tank.

And anything remaining would be used for betterment of world around me.   As once you have everything really that’s only way to gain is to make life’s around you better. And once they have everything then widen the circle.  And me personally I would probably find causes or people to run find ways to make things better. Without me being super involved. Back to the whole I am going to be on beach somewhere thing.  As for the fulfillment crap people talk about how fulfilling life of work is. Work is a means to end with that end being able to live safe happy life with family.  If your end is working you’re not living life right. And more you do it more distant friends and family become.

"I've had a Tesla for almost five years. The car constantly misunderstands or misidentifies its surroundings. It still gets very confused every time it sees a truck pulling an empty trailer and vacillates between thinking its a semi truck that it should give plenty of space to or not seeing the trailer at all and trying to drive into the back of it.   Even after all this time phantom braking continues to be an issue because it gets scared of the shadows of overpasses and frequently slows to a crawl when approaching them with autopilot on.   FSD drives in unpredictable ways, caring somewhat about the car itself but seemingly not at all about the other cars around it. It'll change lanes into a space that just barely has enough space for it making others have to react to you cutting them off. It never makes you feel safe. It'll tailgate even with the distance set to max and then always wants to brake as late as possible in traffic so you risk being rear-ended. The point of FSD is that you'll ultimately be able to turn it on and do other things like you would if a person is driving but as it stands you are constantly on edge because it's eventually going to do something that is either dangerous, dickish, or just very stupid.  But yes, it can technically see in all directions under perfect conditions.

The phantom braking happens often enough that I can usually anticipate when it'll happen. There's a stretch of interstate I drive every day that if I hit at the right time of day will always result in a shadow that it gets scared of and slows down for even if there is no one around me for 500 feet in any direction.  I know that the graphic it shows isn't influencing its actions but it's indicative of it not really seeing it well enough to even guess between giant 18 wheeler and pick up truck with a five foot trailer. It 100% struggles to gauge distance in scenarios with empty trailers(specifically flat bed trailers like landscapers would use) and will change between giving lots of distance and then not even realizing it's there so switches to normal following distance as though it were just the truck. If you let it, it'll get super close and then emergency brake with that super loud high pitched warning beep when it realizes the trailer is there.  In any event, if you want to achieve Level 3 autonomy, which Musk claims is just around the corner, the car needs to be able drive itself under all conditions(meaning all conditions that would be safe for a human to drive in) and cameras alone are not enough to do that. It does a noticeably worse even if it's just dark out and if it's anything other than perfect weather it'll often tell you it's working with diminished capability and that speeds will be limited due to poor visibility even when to a human it seems totally fine.",thalasi_,2025-05-02T09:42:59,1
