"Wow, this is pretty incredible. With the Dems still so incompetent with messaging, and tied up with so many conflicting special interests and ideologies, I can see an ostensibly more liberal, common-sense version of the Republican party splitting off and uniting with centrist Democrats to leave the relatively more extreme MAGA and Progressive Dems hanging out to dry the next election. Because anyone with half a brain, even greedy POS's, are thinking Trump is bad for American interests.",Kilgoretrout321,2025-04-08T17:21:44,6
"If they pass it and it goes to 47â€™s desk, he vetoes, they can try to override his veto.  To override a presidential veto, both chambers of Congress must vote to pass the bill again with a two-thirds majority in each chamber.

I think it's more that they're afraid they'll lose both houses in the mid-terms if they don't do something. They couldn't care less about their constituents. They just want to save their own asses.

"You aren't lying.  I was""accidentally"" sent a video by my Trump- loving brother.  In the video, some pastor was saying, ""Trump is not the Savior, he is a tourniquet.""  I sent a response to my brother saying, ""To you he's a tourniquet, to me he's a cancer on the world.""  He replied with Matthew 24:8 - All these are the beginning of birth pains.""  Basically, the beginning of end times.  He also said he was praying for me.  So that's what the Trump Christians believe.",One-Low1033,2025-04-09T21:05:00,1

"They travel to whatever reality gets them votes. Clearly it has worked. Dems, meanwhile, ridiculed poor, white voters for years instead of, ironically, being *inclusive*. Winning these big elections is about getting **enough** of them to come out ahead. The tired fallacy of ""we don't have to appeal to ANY right-wing and centrist voters because there are enough Dems in the country to win if we can just convince them to vote,"" has been proven wrong many times. This is politics...I mean, it's literally the heart and soul of the discipline to appeal to as many voters as possible in order to win power! Apolitical voters vote based on the economy first, and maybe international relations as well. Activated political voters tend to vote based on wedge issues and are already committed to their party as if they were a sports team.",Kilgoretrout321,2025-04-08T21:54:22,1
