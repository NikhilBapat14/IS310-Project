Finally Mr. Romero’s story is getting more light! Hope he’s still alive and ok as he can be.,Sevren425,2025-04-24T15:29:49,27
"Good. If the party is worried about pursuing CECOT advocacy in terms of ‘losing ground’ and votes or what not, then I honestly believe they’re doing the general public a disservice. Andry’s case is not only sympathetic, it also exposes the absurdity of trump administration, DHS, and ICE. No one possessed of even a little reason is going to look at Andry’s pictures and social media and buy that he’s a hardened, dangerous TdA member. Absurd. And then it throws every single case of CECOT detainment into further question.  Keep pushing!  Editing to include appreciation for Representative Robert Garcia! I feel he may have to push to include Andry’s name in their public/press advocacy while visiting El Salvador and I’m damn proud of him. ",Calm_Pudding2684,2025-04-24T16:27:37,22
"I am all for this. But I feel Dems need less focus on immigration and more focus on the economy.  Priority# 1 must be to win back House/Senate majorities at midterms.  If we are going to sway independents, people who didn’t bother to vote in 2024 and some Republicans the ONLY topic that will move them will be jobs and the cost of living.  Remember we cannot impeach Trump unless we win a majority.  Yes, immigration is importation. Stopping illegal deportations without due process is important. Impeaching Trump is critical.  But we cannot do those things without majorities in House/Senate.  .",bakeacake45,2025-04-26T12:17:54,1

"Actually they can’t.  Their media game is not where it needs to be to accomplish that without losing on both topics. We keep making the same mistakes over and over.  If you want to win, you have to make it all about the economy.  Do I like this situation-no. But your average American cares more about being able to financially run their household than the deportation of immigrants. I hate it’s this way but that’s the situation we are in.  We cannot stop what is happening in our immigrant communities unless we can win a majority in Congress.",bakeacake45,2025-04-26T13:09:48,1
Well everyone I know is talking about. Same way you and I know Trump is crashing the economy and prices are getting higher thanks to tariffs.,Gr8daze,2025-04-26T13:45:40,1
"And why are they talking about it, because Dems refuse to change the topic.",bakeacake45,2025-04-26T14:36:52,0
