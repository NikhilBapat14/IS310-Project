"Trump administration is pushing through their agenda without much resistance on the domestic stage. The tariff stuff/things that affect the world stage are getting a lot more pushback because trump has less control over what the other world leaders do. Other countries are taking real and swift action to bypass the US in business and political dealings.   Meanwhile, I see most democrats in power doing things like making signs, discussing, sitting, speaking which is all effectively useless. The rules have changed—not because we’ve all agreed to rule changes, but because now some people are playing by their own rules.   Politicians used to challenge one another to duels and while I don’t want our leaders running around shooting guns at each other, I wouldn’t mind seeing a little more of that “risking something personal” energy.

"Alright, let's get into it - this is just more Kente cloth bullshit.  ""With friends like these, who needs enemies?""  The ""we don't have a majority"" excuse is pathetic. Republicans didn’t stop planning, organizing, or taking action when they were out of power. They used think tanks, built legal frameworks, coordinated media messaging, and lined up operatives years in advance. Losing an election to them is just the start of the next campaign.   Democrats whining about not having a majority just shows they’re not serious about power.  First, Dems need to start building shadow policy infrastructure right now. Republicans have ""Project 2025"" and Dems should have their own government-in-waiting ready to deploy on Day One: Full executive orders pre-written, full staffing lists ready, and policy mapped to specific agencies - not just ideas, but operational documents. Also, it should be built outside the DNC because the official party is too slow and cowardly for this.  Second, Dems need to wage lawfare constantly. Sue state legislatures, sue agencies, sue over constitutional violations, voting rights abuses, ethics violations, Hatch Act breaches. Force Republicans to spend money and time defending themselves. Weaponize the courts the way the GOP has for decades — not for show.  Third, they need to get WAY better at narrative warfare. Republicans don’t just ""report"" the news, they create entire media pipelines to control what people think the news even is. Dems need to aggressively fund and coordinate media arms, podcasts, social media influencers, and local news pipelines that push their frames every day - stop reacting and start shaping the conversation.  Procedurally, Democrats can make Republican governance hell even from the minority. Object to everything. Demand roll-call votes. Weaponize the rules. Republicans did it to Obama for eight straight years.   Every single inch Republicans take should cost them effort and political capital.  Dems desperately need to fix their obsession with national elections while neglecting states. Republicans control the country largely because they control state legislatures, state attorneys general, local election boards, etc. If Dems spent half the energy on flipping state houses that they do fundraising for doomed Senate races, they wouldn’t be in this mess.  Recruitment is another issue. The GOP recruits veterans, farmers, sheriffs, pastors - people with local credibility. Dems too often pick hyper-polished consultants who can’t connect with voters. Build real pipelines of mayors, nurses, teachers, union organizers, etc., and start now, not six months before the midterms.  They also need to exploit GOP fractures. The Republican Party is not actually unified - the Chamber of Commerce wing hates the MAGA wing, suburban women are disgusted by abortion bans, veterans are pissed about VA cuts, etc. Dems should be driving wedges into those cracks daily.   Find pain points, exploit them relentlessly.  And stop playing nice with GOP leadership. Investigate them. File ethics complaints. Leak stories. Bury them in scandals. Republicans don’t hesitate to kneecap Democratic leaders (Hillary's emails, Hunter Biden, etc.). It’s time to respond in kind.  Finally, Democrats have to END their fetish for ""decorum."" Republicans are burning the institutions down while Dems are still writing letters to the editor. Fight for structural reforms like court expansion, DOJ reorganization, DC and Puerto Rico statehood. Fight to win, not to ""look good losing.""  Republicans plan for dominance no matter if they’re winning or losing. Democrats need to plan for obstruction, disruption, litigation, and insurgency no matter if they’re winning or losing.   You don’t need a majority to wage asymmetrical political warfare. You need a plan.",cjwidd,2025-04-27T16:43:40,22

"Edit for clarity: I’m not saying anyone needs to think this protest is important or good, just that saying “it’s too late” is defeatist language and not helpful to the overall message and that “it’s not enough, we need mass protest” by itself was a good message. I’m only saying that little end piece wasn’t necessary, not disagreeing with the message we need to do more. We do need more. **I agree this isn’t enough. I agree it’s serious** But adding that it’s too late doesn’t make the message any stronger and actually hurts the message. That’s it. The literal only problem I have is that OP saying that defeats the call for action by saying it doesn’t matter anyway. I don’t know why the message is being lost but this isn’t at all about the protest, only about those specific words. I’m agreeing we need to keep fighting and fight more or I wouldn’t be bothering saying it at all.   **So TLDR: yes we need to do more I agree. Never said otherwise and it’s true this isn’t enough. “It’s too late” is defeatist and changes your message’s purpose**  Oh okay so let’s all roll over and just die then since there’s no hope and it’s too late. If you think this particular thing isn’t enough that’s one thing and I agree, but do you hear yourself? Even in the absolute worst case scenario possible like literal full scale Germany holocaust there were still things people could do even if they were small. It’s not “too late”.  You can be realistic about the hell we’re descending into and also ask for more and want more and expect more without throwing a pity party and giving up. I’m sick of people like you coming into posts only to doom and tell everyone it’s pointless, you’re not doing anything for anyone and frankly it’s annoying seeing you guys play this game of “let’s all feel bad and discount anything and everything we see so we can justify not doing anything and bring others down with us. We’re so sad there’s nothing we can do.”   Again If you don’t like this particular protest that’s one thing and I won’t tell you how to feel on that (it’s only one the second part of your comment I’m addressing) but to declare “it’s too late” is stupid, ignorant, and only hurts any efforts you pretend you care about. Your attitude is defeatist and helps nobody. If you’re that determined to give up and lay by the wayside because it’s too hard, then at least do it away from the rest of us who still believe in trying until we literally can’t anymore so you’re at least not actively hurting and annoying those doing what they can. You’re giving them the greatest gift they could ever ask for in your surrender to helplessness   If everyone acted the way you are now nobody would have ever clawed their way out of any dystopian circumstances, none of the horrific events of history would have ever been overcome, so I hope the majority doesn’t have such a pathetic outlook like you right now or we really are screwed. It was never going to be easy, it was never going to be quick, it was never going to be great instantly. Do I think we’re going too slow and have worries? Of course, I want more from the general public and like everyone have fears even though I do all I can.

"And the whole thing will get called off in a moment if a phone call comes from one of the big money donors offering a speaking gig at a dinner.  This is done to make Jefferies look less ineffectual and help boost Booker more for when they decide it's ""his turn"".  It's being done in a way to avoid any actual confrontation and is easily ignored by both the GOP and media.  I understand they've given up when it comes to actual legislating (which isn't entirely their fault and all) but when they do this limp wristed ""resistance"" it's in the most out of the way forgettable way possible.  The whole fascist dismantling of our country is coming down through EO?  Gather up as many people as you can, you are supposed to be leaders of our country after all, and block the fucking White House, Trump's country club, the agencies they've been sending their goons to, the Pentagon, and basically places where actual business is being done.  Instead you're picking a weekend day to hang out on the steps of a building where none of the stuff they claim to have a problem with is being done.  Protest and sit ins aren't about just picking a quiet corner to stay out of the way.  Trump and the other traitors are just laughing when they hear about this.  They know these efforts mean nothing and provide no risk to either the GOP or the ""opposition"" as it's the most meek mannered way to protest.  Peaceful protest only actually works when you get up in their faces and make them feel uncomfortable and this is very much just playing up the Fox News propaganda of how pathetic the Democrats are at getting things done.",UnquestionabIe,2025-04-27T10:48:30,0

"> no real power  Power isn’t the ability to cast a vote in Congress. It’s the ability to represent the interests of millions of people.   Chris Van Hollen used that power when he went down to El Salvador, pressuring Bukele as a representative of the US government and its people.   Bernie uses that power when he goes town to town mobilizing people in different regions around the country, including Republican districts. He highlights local progressive talent and helps protesters organize.  Booker used that power when he held a filibuster to break a record, forcing the media to cover it and take some spotlight away from Trump.  These are focused applications of the power they have. They strategically build organizations or bring media attention to our brand. Dems have gotten very lazy about applying it anywhere except the halls of Congress and MSNBC.   This protest is meaningless. It doesn’t disrupt anyone except Congress which already does no work. It still doesn’t help make it clear what Dems stand for in opposition to Trump.

"I would say that our party's extreme inaction for decades straight has become a major cultural touchstone issue by itself. We as a party have completely lost our fire for the whole 21st century and I remember it was a huge criticism even in the Bush era. Obama had fire, but that was an Obama thing and not a Dem thing. I mean he literally had a competing campaign organization rivaling Dem infrastructure.  This has put us in a lose-lose situation, especially of late. Schumer's art of the kneel made most everyone lose all patience with the passivity, the actual gestures we did (color coordination and signs) looked ridiculously weak. Half-baked, timid attempts are being mocked almost as much as inaction and people are inclined to read anything as weak if it's not big and bold. Understandable, given how we got here.  Which leads us to where we are. Our party has been practically allergic to boldness for decades and our internal leadership reflects that--big, bold moves are not our leadership's natural strength. But anything that doesn't hit a minimum boldness level looks insincere. AOC and Bernie's rallies read as big, bold, and sincere. Flying down to El Salvador to argue directly at the prison there & confirm the guy is still alive reads as brave and sincere. Sitting on the capitol steps, though...is that really the best they could come up with?  I would also say that Washington insider bubble effect is the big undercurrent we see here. The public (including most Dems) consistently dislikes Washington insider bureaucrat types and our party has been in willful denial about that most of the 21st century, leading to a lot of unnecessary losses.

"Did you even read what I actually wrote or just the first sentence and reacted, because you’ve misrepresented what I’ve said a lot. Because your response suggested the former. If you did *you would see I AGREE WITH YOU IT ISNT ENOUGH and that wasn’t at all what I was saying* I never once disagreed with you the issues were serious or that this was good enough or that we shouldn’t do more. In fact I pretty clearly agree with you that it’s important we do more hence the reason I’m asking you to be better with your wording, because I believe that it matters *we do something* and not undermine it with the doom last sentence. You’re reading what I said about as wrong as you can.   Or does “You can be realistic about the hell we’re descending into and also ask for more and want more and expect more without throwing a pity party and giving up”  And  “If you don’t like this particular protest that’s one thing and I won’t tell you how to feel on that”  suddenly mean something else that I don’t know about? If I thought this was all it took and that I didn’t understand the problem or was defending this as the end all be all of protests, shouldn’t it be pretty obvious I’d say something else and that’s not what I’m saying here? I personally think those statements alone (assuming you again *read them*) should’ve given you a better response than this misinterpretation of what I meant.   I explicitly a few times made it clear my problem is not that you don’t like what they’re doing or that you don’t think it’s enough, it’s your wording on giving up. My whole post is on that so I don’t know how you took something else away from it. If you truly were just here “to demand we fight” you’d have excluded that part of your comment (the same way *literally everyone* asking for change and action and mass protest has done without adding the unnecessary gloom. Many, many people are asking for the same things as you and I agree with that, but “it’s too late” adds nothing to the discourse and in fact is in opposition with what you’re saying. How can that be taken as any other way than doomposting. If **everyone else** can say your true meaning without “it’s too late” doomerism so can you, and I’d have had no issue with your comment then). “It won’t do a damn thing, we need massive resistance” was a complete and totally fine sentence. That’s *literally all I’m saying*, that your phrasing wasn’t helping and was contributing to helplessness rather than strength, that your words matter and how you frame them, I’m really not sure why you don’t get that.   But maybe you won’t read this comment either given what you said about the last one clearly showing you didn’t the previous one. I guess that’s up to you. But if you’re determined to miss the point and don’t want to do better on your messaging and achieve what you’re actually trying to say (and god forbid we ever learn anything from each other or admit we can be wrong on anything even something small) I can’t change that. That’s your decision.  **But okay again TLDR so I don’t get misrepresented again:**  “We need to do more than this and stand up in mass protest” **good and I agree**  “It’s too late” **bad and not helpful and actually makes your message weaker**",Lostsock1995,2025-04-27T17:21:41,0

">It's extra work, but it is worth it to really dig into these issues.  It is so funny to the democrat strategy being used by people who should be holding their own party responsible. Parroting the party talking points isn't ""nuance"" or ""extra work"". You can just say ""vote blue no matter who"" and have the same message. Just because you think not voting, doesn't mean you are approving of the results. Some people draw the line at supporting a genocide. It isn't on that person that the genocide continues, as it would have either way. So just because you say something, doesn't automatically make it false.  Referencing a government shutdown as just ""that's bad"" probably requires a little more nuance that you were referencing. For instance, with everything Trump is doing with the government, maybe a government shut down wouldn't be the worst thing. Especially considering that government shutdowns are generally blamed on the sitting president, and with republicans controlling congress too, it would most likely shoulder all of the blame other than somewhere like Fox news.

"> It is so funny to the democrat strategy being used by people who should be holding their own party responsible. Parroting the party talking points isn't ""nuance"" or ""extra work"". You can just say ""vote blue no matter who"" and have the same message. Just because you think not voting, doesn't mean you are approving of the results. Some people draw the line at supporting a genocide. It isn't on that person that the genocide continues, as it would have either way. So just because you say something, doesn't automatically make it false.  This is another example of you missing the nuance and the extra work to delve into the issues would help you understand things.   Americans chose the worst possible option for Gaza with Trump winning. His latest comments about letting Netanyahu do everything he wants as well as telling the people of Gaza that they have to essentially give up and let America ""repurpose the land"" is proof of that.   At least with Kamala you actually had a chance at some kind of resolution, and she even talked about there being something she'd like to do to resolve that fighting. She's also someone you can reason with and talk to to change her mind on things. This is a common thing that Democrat presidents have done (see Obama / Biden who have changed their stances on things under pressure).   Trump won't listen and you can't persuade him. We know this from 2016.   > Referencing a government shutdown as just ""that's bad"" probably requires a little more nuance that you were referencing. For instance, with everything Trump is doing with the government, maybe a government shut down wouldn't be the worst thing.  This is another example of you missing the nuance and the extra work to delve into the issues would help you understand things.   A government shutdown means that the executive gets extra powers ""unlocked"". During a shutdown, the executive gets to decide which jobs can stay while the shutdown is ongoing. So instead of a judge being able to reinstate people who were fired (we are seeing that now), they would be unable to. Basically in the interest of ""saving money"", Trump gets to just fire people without any process what-so-ever. Musk has even said a shutdown is more preferable since they would be able to do this.   To add to this, when the government shuts down, the courts also slow down and potentially grind to a halt since they are also no longer getting funding. So all of the court cases that Trump is losing because of his lawlessness would slow down too.  Further, with this Republican Congress, the threat of shutdown could mean that we don't reopen for a long time either.   As you can see, these issues require nuance, as I keep suggesting.   >  Especially considering that government shutdowns are generally blamed on the sitting president, and with republicans controlling congress too, it would most likely shoulder all of the blame other than somewhere like Fox news. Again, nuance.  That is one benefit, but you also run the risk of people not believing it too. In 2013, the Republicans added a poison pill amendment to the budget bill that would have destroyed Obamacare. Senate Democrats in the Senate held and decided they would let the bill die rather than let Obamacare get gutted.   It was essentially legislative terrorism - the Republicans had the House but not the Senate, and could not repeal Obamacare on their own. So they added a poison pill to the budge and said ""Either you kill Obamcare, or we blow up the country with a shutdown"".   Democrats said fuck you, and we shutdown in October.   The following election the American people saw this and then rewarded the Republicans with more control of the House, and flipped the Senate to Republican control.   In a way, it is a good example of people blaming those in power - but partly because they have no fucking clue what's going on and they don't pay attention. It's risky.   > The fact you can't even say that Hakeem Jeffries shouldn't support Eric Adams is really telling.  It helps to get my quotes correct. I said:  ""The only critique I have of ***that***""  ***That*** referencing the discussion of using the filibuster in the US Senate for the budget bill that you brought up lol.   I think it would do you some good to spend time to research these issues better. You're missing a lot of nuance here. And I think it might be good to reread things before making comments.

They're deporting American citizens, firing unionized federal workers without cause, arresting judges and so much more. So pretty much with or without a government shutdown the current administration will do what they want whenever they want.   So the consensus for pretty much everyone but Chuck Schumer (Josh Shapiro, Nancy Pelosi, AOC) was that you use this as leverage and if the government goes into a shutdown the actions of the Trump Administration is wholly on him. By passing the CR you give his actions more legitimacy and credence because the dems voted with the Republicans.

"I'm not sure if you didn't read my post, or if you didn't understand it.   I'll try to break it down for you in smaller chunks.   A government shutdown ""unlocks"" certain things for Trump as the Executive.   - He gets to decide who goes to work, and who stays home under a shutdown. This gives him more power to fire and control people at three letter agencies greater than he does now.   - The courts lose funding, and so lawsuits against Trump slow down and in some cases stop completely. So things like the court ordering buses be turned around and those folks not deported (which happened recently), would not have occurred under a shutdown. Lawsuits against Trump that have given fired workers their jobs back, also would not have occurred or taken longer to fix had the government shutdown.  - This Republican Congress is dysfunctional. There would be no telling how long such a shutdown would have lasted had it happened then. All sorts of shit gets fucked when that occurs for too long.

"> I mean, what greater “political reason” could there be than showing your constituents that you’re not gonna play ball with an illegitimate administration that’s tearing the country apart?  Since the Sec. positions cannot be filibustered in the Senate, some Senators in purple states may pick and choose their battles.   So for the really bad choices, like Pete Hegseth, you see every Democrat voting 'no'.   For choices that are ""not that bad"", like Rubio, you have some Democrats voting 'yes'.   That's literally how politics works - but more specifically you have to play the game because the average voter isn't really paying attention to what is happening, right?  Pete Hegseth is too dangerous and incompetent to be Sec. of Defense. He's fucking up bigly, and Democrats voting 'no' shows they were right on that.   Rubio is a different situation because he is actually qualified for the position, even though he is a weasel. Right leaning ***voters*** who actually vote in the Democrat states and could be deciding factors, need to see that their Democrat Senator is ""making good choices"".

This Republican Congress is dysfunctional, meaning that they are unlikely to be able to navigate successful a budget to lift the shutdown. Which makes my first two points more impactful as it would take them longer to coble something together because they are dysfunctional.   As for the tax cuts, Republicans cannot overcome a filibuster, so they will have to use Reconciliation. Reconciliation in legislative terms means that the law pass simply needs a majority in both houses, but it has to either be budget neutral or make money.   This means they will have to cut funding somewhere which will be very hard to do without cutting things like Social Security or Medicare / Medicaid.

A government shutdown would allow Heinrich Himmler (Kristi Noem) and the Gestapo (ICE) to unlawfully detain and deport countless other Hispanic people to the gulag in El Salvador.   Trump's regime and his SS are ruining people's fucking lives as we speak, and there are a few Democrats fighting back as best they can. Cory Booker is one of them, and he's using his voice to stop Trump's budget, which would revert us back to the stone age and cause people to die in the fucking streets because they got kicked off their healthcare.      These two clowns want to sit here and say that Booker and Jeffries still aren't perfect enough? They are directly asking their constituents and other Americans to tell them their concerns, and they're calling on other Republican senators to step up and stop this.   They are doing their part, and WE the people need to join them. It's incredibly useless to sit behind a keyboard and only criticize Democrats, and demand that they cater to **your** every need. When you're voting, you're also voting for what would be best for our country, so not everything is about yourself.",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-27T23:12:19,1
