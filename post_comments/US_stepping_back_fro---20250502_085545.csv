"What President Trump will never understand is that he overplayed his hand before he was even elected. When you claim publicly over and over again that you'll end the war within 24 hours of assuming office, you put the pressure on yourself not the parties with which you're negotiating. All Russia had to do to undermine the US's position globally was not end the war. Sanctions and back channels are the only way to negotiate with an adversary like Russia.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-05-02T11:36:35,218
"State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters that the US “will not be the mediators” going forward, reflecting President Trump’s frustration at the lack of progress between Kyiv and Moscow in ending the bloodshed.  “We are not going to fly around the world at the drop of a hat to mediate meetings,” she said, adding that the US remains committed to helping reach a deal.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T09:46:57,30
"At this point we need to. We’ve got the mineral deal secured so we now have a “payback plan” from Ukraine for when we send them equipment/support.  But trying to broker/push peace on two warring nations needs to stop. We shouldn’t be the ones engaging that.  IMO, the US needs to focus on continuing to be the world economic and military power (in other words suicide to even try invading us in any way) and leave itself out of war affairs of other nations, unless it has a direct impact on the US itself.",ITrCool,2025-05-02T09:44:43,-25
"But who has cards. Someone has to have the cards, right? Play the cards. Draw 4, go fish, old maid, bridge. I've been holding an uno reverse waiting for this opportunity.",Icy-Mix-3977,2025-05-02T19:11:21,8
"What is with this propaganda?     This isn't our war. We have no reason to fund it. We didn't start it. We shouldn't end it. Sanctioning Russia is a good idea, yes, but we have no responsibility to send weapons to Ukraine, and no responsibility to burden any economic difficulty if the war should end in a way we don't like. It's not our war.     I don't understand this police-the-world mentality.",therinlahhan,2025-05-02T19:18:44,-5
I think theres something to be said for getting Ukraine to the table and have some agreements with them.  There's a case to be made that the Ukrainians had so much international goodwill that there was propaganda around that they were going to recapture Crimea and the other territories which isn't happening absent a foreign military like the US entering the conflict.  At the same time you kind of want to leave the territories as a bargaining tactic in the negotiations rather than settling them before it happens.,hiricinee,2025-05-02T18:57:28,-3
"Read the text of the mineral deal.  The ""payback plan"" is for new projects only wherein American companies invest in the projects.  Those companies aren't going to deploy people and resources into a war zone that also have the potential to get nationalized by Russia.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-05-02T10:18:43,89
"“Two warring nations…” No, only one nation wants war, the other is simply defending themselves.",DandierChip,2025-05-02T14:16:03,95
"That plan fucking sucks. Doesn’t say anything about the money we’ve already sent, and doesn’t really give us anything, it merely gives US companies the ability to “bid” on deals. Deals that the Ukrainians themselves can also bid on.",Unlucky_Buyer_2707,2025-05-02T15:29:14,12
You can not understand an opinion and that doesn’t mean it represents propaganda   Do you feel the same way about Israel ? Just wash our hands of it and walk away. Not our war right ?,MapleMonstera,2025-05-04T07:51:55,6
"Do you see ""propaganda"" as synonymous with ""opinion""? My comment isn't pro-ukraine, it isn't pro-russia, it takes no stance for or against the US. I'm not advocating for the continuation of the war. I'm not advocating for more or less funding to a foreign country. I'm stating that the President failed to understand the complexities of international deplomacy when he said he would end the war in 24 hours.",Conscious-Toe-4220,2025-05-02T20:57:07,16
