Ah yes.  The Tea Party.  Those were good times.,Tiny_Structure_7,2025-04-22T16:45:26,34
"John picked her to send a message to the GOP. “We’ll never win an election with nut jobs like this on the ticket”   Instead, the message they took from it was “we lost because John McCain was too normal, we need more crazy people like Sarah Palin.”",Alex72598,2025-04-22T16:46:01,61
"Naw he just listened to the think tanks and other idiots instead of thinking with his gut. His actual pick was Lieberman, his best friend, and I can see how the gop brains at that point, tea party etc, would be freaking the f out knowing this.   Picking a Dem would mean that the politics of hate and slander wouldnt work. There are a lot of people who make a lot of money in that space.",Mo-shen,2025-04-22T19:58:38,9
Agreed. John McCain should of done his homework and realize that Sarah Palin was grossly incompatible with his platform.   It was like dropping a lit match into a 50 gallon drum full of kerosene and expecting it not to blow up or burst into flames.,Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-22T18:09:01,16
I believe in his memoir he openly admitted he regretted picking Palin and wished he had picked Joe Lieberman instead.,SteelPenguin947,2025-04-22T23:59:58,2

"'ve is undergoing a spelling change. It's ok that you want to correct people, but we're often saying ""should of"" or something like it.   Do you ever really hear the 'v' sound the contraction is supposed to make when people say it?   Language is spoken first, written second and I'd much rather see in discussion forums like this the way a person speaks than to treat every conversation like it's a formal English classroom",RellenD,2025-04-23T09:20:57,0
Agreed. The same thing can be somewhat said about MTG.,Viking_Musicologist,2025-04-23T07:22:08,3

"This subreddit ain't got nothing to do with the actual democratic party, but thanks for proving my point",bigrob_in_ATX,2025-04-22T17:16:21,1
"It's not a matter of what you think you hear. It's respecting the language and understanding the contraction that creates should've.   Folks often say shoulda, woulda, coulda. Slang is of course understandable. But I think it is important when using a written form of communication to at least understand the words being used.",scotch-o,2025-04-23T09:29:44,1
This isn't a formal setting and 'should of' is a more accurate representation of what is being said.   You agreeing with that or not isn't going to stop informal speech from being informal,RellenD,2025-04-23T09:35:50,1
"You are absolutely correct this is not what one would consider a formal setting.   And no, my single expressed really won't change much at all in the world. I am not so delusional that I feel I have that influence. Nor is that the intention.   I hope you have a great day.",scotch-o,2025-04-23T09:40:43,2
