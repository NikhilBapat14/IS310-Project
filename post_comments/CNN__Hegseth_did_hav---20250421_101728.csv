What a moron.,sjolson78,2025-04-21T17:23:12,9
This is like those people on warthunder forums bragging they have military secrets in order to look cool  Atleast with the first signal incident it was people he worked with and someone accidently adding a journalist  But this time it just seems like hes trying to look cool to family members,qishibe,2025-04-21T11:41:58,10
He just described his FoxNews role.,MajorMorelock,2025-04-21T16:20:59,8
"I can‚Äôt imagine his brother and his wife(and likely not his lawyer either) have top secret security clearance to hear confidential US national security information. And certainly his private cell phone isn‚Äôt suitable to protect it!  We knew this guy was going to suck at this job, we gave him a trial run and he totally failed. Now send him back to Faux News and replace him with someone who has the r√©sum√© to do the job competently!",OptimalRisk7508,2025-04-21T16:05:12,7

"With Republicans hiding from constituents and cancelling town halls, perhaps we should all get on Signal and wait to be invited to a chat about JD's eyeliner or Trump's pee tapes held by Putin.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-21T11:31:43,5
That kid in the background of Hegseth talking is not buying any of what he‚Äôs saying.,helvetica_unicorn,2025-04-21T11:35:02,6
Not a supporter but trump should drop this dude either way. This is beyond gross negligence and hes trying to gaslight the people that told on him. Its disgusting,Lumpymaximus,2025-04-22T17:57:25,4
"I mean, who‚Äôs not sharing war plans and military strategies placing thousands in danger of what he calls ‚Äúwar fighters‚Äù, then does exactly that, with their ‚Äúreal‚Äù inner circle. Trump picks playing house and battleship meanwhile entire planet hates it has no respect for us. Pete, Petey, c‚Äômon.",BrianOconneR34,2025-04-21T13:19:03,4

He needs his drivers license revoked.,specqq,2025-04-21T14:21:53,7
The first one was careless. Still inexcusable for someone at his level. This one was on purpose. He clearly has no regard for security. He has no business being in his position.,sketchahedron,2025-04-21T12:45:03,4
My husband has relatively high civilian clearance and never ever discusses work at home. He also has to turn off his mobile and disable the Google speaker in his office when he takes meetings and has strict rules about logging in to do remote work. He would be fired for any of WhiskyLeaks‚Äô actions.,TheRealCeeBeeGee,2025-04-21T17:17:46,7
