"I read the article. Didnâ€™t follow the trial, but watched the video.   Iâ€™m pretty shocked. That looked like a straight gang beating and I donâ€™t think any one of them is innocent, even if one or two were more brutal than the others.",ScumbagGina,2025-05-07T23:19:25,35
"""Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother just steps from his home.""  As Chris Rock said ""Everyone knows that if the police have to run to get you,Â they'reÂ bringing anÂ ass-whipping withÂ them.""",cossbobo,2025-05-07T16:46:04,89
">Defense attorneys attempted to refute accusations that the officers used excessive force to subdue Nichols and followed police policies and standards.  From the looks of the headline, it would sound like their strategy was a success. Leave it to the journalist to phrase things to appear otherwise though.  Jury viewed the evidence, the media's attempt at rendering their own verdict **has failed.**  PSA: if anyone heard ""there's no accountability here"" then they heard wrong, here's a better article where those who are guilty pled guilty instead of going to trial and being found not guilty (as individuals.) [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64422576](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64422576) Trying to lock up squads as a group because one of them did something is collective punishment, it's not the same as prosecuting a bank robber's getaway driver.  Drama peddlers are trying to spark another riot, anyone with friends&family in the area remind them to take extra precautions if things start getting loud.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T16:08:44,71
Really surprising. Tbh these dudes getting found not guilty just feels fucking gross.,hellenkellerfraud911,2025-05-07T16:55:14,65
Honestly shocking ðŸ˜²,West_Consequence6288,2025-05-07T23:40:41,6
These are all state charges. The prosecutor overcharged these three cops who werenâ€™t the officers that initiated the beat down. Theyâ€™ve all been charged federally.   This is kinda a nothing burger.,Oldfordtruck,2025-05-08T00:17:01,4
"After further research, it appears that the two that actually did most of the beating, the ones that actually kicked him and beat him with a baton, already pled guilty. But still, I think that at least two of these three acquitted were holding him down while the other two attacked him, which is just as guilty in my book.",r777m,2025-05-07T23:32:12,15
There's a video of the incident. It's brutal.,JackNoir1115,2025-05-07T21:00:05,38
I think the whole way they charged them as a group is what sank them   Can you imagine the guy that took a plea deal?   Itâ€™s also worth nothing that they already got found guilty of federal charges so theyâ€™re not out of the woods,plitspidter,2025-05-07T16:31:44,26
"Itâ€™s really not, they didnâ€™t get found guilty of anything which is insane   They were already found guilty in federal court so itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re home free",plitspidter,2025-05-08T04:05:02,1
The one that kicked him in the head and delivered the blow that almost certainly killed Nichols is being tried separately so they wisely pointed the finger at him,plitspidter,2025-05-08T04:04:01,11
"Multiple things you've said go along with my motivations for that PSA part, as original link starts out to the effect of ""white jury lets black guy's killers go.""  They're trying to conjure up the most dramatic image possible, because drama pays the bills. Drama also gets voted to the top every time, I want so say 'blame voters' but the lion's share of votes cast probably aren't any of us (or possibly even human) anyway.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T17:10:12,6
