"Text from [Sen. Mark Kelly's thread](https://bsky.app/profile/captmarkkelly.bsky.social/post/3llrwl6awm22k):  > A lot of people are wondering what they can do right now. >  > Nothing will solve our problems overnight. But here are just few ways we can all DO SOMETHING to fight back against the Trump Administration as they upend lives, threaten health care, and break the law. ðŸ§µ >  > Voting is #1. Participate in EVERY election. Many places have elections throughout the year, but too many folks sit them out. >  > Look at Wisconsin and Florida today. There is no off-season. Read up on elections in your area and check your voter registration status at [IWillVote.com](https://iwillvote.com/). >  > Stay informed and spread the truth. The internet can be a cesspool of misinformation, but we can fight back by talking to our friends and family to make sure everyone knows what Trump and Elon are doing. Ignore the noise and keep it up. >  > Advocate for voting rights, campaign finance reform, and transparency in government. We need to be talking about these things day and night. Iâ€™ll keep fighting for this in the Senate, and I need you to keep fighting in your local communities. >  > Speaking of, get involved in your community RIGHT NOW. Not next year or month. NOW. >  > Find organizations or groups you support and volunteer. They could be protecting democracy or fighting Medicaid cuts. Nothing is more valuable than your time, and I know they would appreciate it. >  > This final one is the most important. Show up, do the work, and donâ€™t give up. The non-stop bad news can wear you down. But giving up and accepting defeat is exactly what Trump and Elon want. Theyâ€™ll only succeed if we let them.",progress18,2025-04-02T08:10:50,7
"To add to that list .... engage in conservative forums, push back the MAGA nutjobs in  your family no matter how aggravating it is.",cone10,2025-04-02T08:45:03,5
I wonder if we can get voting by state and who are the candidates pinned in this group.,Lebarican22,2025-04-02T09:24:57,3
"I love Kelly, he's really trying.   I would really love someone here to create a sub built around organizing, something that can function as a think tank and resource.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-02T15:58:24,2
