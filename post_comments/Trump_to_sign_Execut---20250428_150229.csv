"One needs be neither fluent nor literate to successfully pass driver licensing tests (whether 'written,' which these days is a series of images with some questions, or the skill examination), though presumably a CDL requires *something* more. Depending on one's state, however, it is possible and might even be required by law for the exam to be offered *in one's native tongue*.  But also if you have a driver's license from any US state, you can drive in Mexico, even though their signs are in Spanish, because the symbols and sign shapes are (mostly) standardized. You can also drive in Europe, where you might drive through four different countries with six different languages represented, but none of them English. If you're using a GPS app, you don't really even *need* signs in many cases.  So I think you're commenting in bad faith here, but supposing you *aren't*, you can *still* often effectively communicate in both written and oral modes using a translation app. I've used them in several cases while traveling abroad, and they work quite well (and they *greatly* simplify things). Even where those apps fail (and they absolutely do make mistakes), usually we can work out what one another is trying to say, because the app is not useless even when it makes mistakes.
