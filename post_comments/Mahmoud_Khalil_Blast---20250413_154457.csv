"I personally love that the left is publicly aligning themselves with idiots like this, tesla vandals, and gang members being deported.

It‚Äôs another to lie to obtain a green card, be a leading violent voice in college protests, and use your green card to persuade and manipulate college kids. Dude! You‚Äôre friggin 31 yr old extremist hanging with kids. Glad to see there is some sanity out there that thinks this is not ok behavior. America is not for this ilk.",sloopSD,2025-04-13T18:06:56,29

"I am really hoping all of these bad calls have an effect.  I don't think most people are okay with erasing the legal meaning of girl, female, or woman, either.  They just don't feel they can say anything out loud.",LK_Feral,2025-04-13T16:32:33,32
"It's a pretty interesting approach. There's been critique from the right about this much focus on individual cases, but to get the public on board with the pending mass deportation ops, there is a need to focus on the human element. People have to see the reason ""why"" by highlighting unsympathetic figures like Khalil.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-13T16:41:53,11
