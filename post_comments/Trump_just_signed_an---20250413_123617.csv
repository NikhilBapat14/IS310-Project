"Remember, last time we had no environmental regulations we eviscerated, decimated welcome, bison, mountain sheep, cougars, turkeys, prairie hens, wolverines, beavers, and so many more species that make up our ecosystem. We NEED regulation and ways to hold people accountable because otherwise individuals will use up resources for their own gain, hurting the environment that we all depend on in the end.

"President Donald Trump’s April 9, 2025, executive order, titled “Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy,” aims to overhaul federal energy regulations by introducing mandatory expiration dates—so-called “sunset provisions”—on existing rules. The goal? Force agencies to periodically reassess and justify their regulations or let them expire. ￼  What’s the Problem?  The administration argues that the U.S. regulatory system has ballooned out of control, with the Code of Federal Regulations nearing 200,000 pages. This regulatory sprawl, they claim, especially hampers energy innovation, leaving the sector stuck in a 1970s-era framework.  ￼  Who’s Affected?  The order targets several federal agencies and their subcomponents, including: ￼ 	•	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 	•	Department of Energy (DOE) 	•	Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 	•	Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) 	•	Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) 	•	Bureau of Land Management (BLM) ￼ 	•	Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) 	•	Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) 	•	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) 	•	U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE)  These agencies must now review regulations tied to key energy statutes, such as the Atomic Energy Act, Energy Policy Acts of 1992 and 2005, and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.  How It Works  Each covered regulation will receive a “Conditional Sunset Date.” If an agency doesn’t actively review and renew a rule by that date, it automatically expires and is removed from the books. This approach is designed to prevent outdated or unnecessary regulations from lingering indefinitely.  ￼  The Bigger Picture  This move is part of a broader deregulatory push by the Trump administration, which argues that excessive regulation stifles economic growth and innovation. Supporters believe this will streamline energy production and reduce bureaucratic red tape. Critics, however, worry it could undermine environmental protections and public health safeguards.  In essence, the administration is telling federal agencies: “Justify your rules or lose them.” ￼",ioweej,2025-04-13T13:07:12,14

"Trumps presidency just shows how weak the US political system is. So many „rules“ were being followed until now because of tradition. But Trump threw all that out the window because nothing is stopping him from acting like he is. No functioning democracy should grant one single office so much power as the US has. The fact that he can just throw out EO after EO is just absurd, and yes, even though most of them are challenged in court it would make sense that those EO only come into effect after they have been unsuccessfully challenged, but no, he can throw out whatever decision he makes as an EO and it’s in effect.",neldela_manson,2025-04-13T15:05:37,8

"Also trump wants to remove the overfishing laws (daily/seasonally maximum fishermen can fish in any year or season) to reduce the ""seafood"" costs. It will reduce it temporarily but once fish stocks are in an unsustainable state it will cost way more.   Which leads one to think creating more scarcity and panic is a strategy for future GOP prospects. (they make fish scarce with over fishing then blame democrats)",TSKNear,2025-04-13T13:15:07,19

"Didn’t say it was a fix regarding Trump, or the only things needed. We need a better functioning Department of Justice, etc. Regardless, the EOs need to go, or heavily be overhauled.  Edit: Yes, an EO in a time of true crisis when you have to act carefully, yet urgently without the voting in Congress and all that. Trump has taken advantage of this mechanism, including what defines an emergency. He think it’s his way to create laws and anything he wants really bad = emergency. Like I said, either EOs need to go, or be overhauled. Perhaps a better, yet more controlled mechanism can be implemented to replace the EOs, if ever get another president that isn’t in Trump’s gang.",leewardisle,2025-04-13T13:45:28,6

"Agreed. And many forget why we have  many of the laws we do. I do think the US can be overbearing in our legal systems. A law for this, that. However, the baseline laws — like workplace safety for teens + age limits on minors being able to work — were because of horrific events in the past that can repeat themselves. But I’m sure some MAGA wouldn’t care if a 13yo is working 12hr days in a coal mine with no workers’ rights/no workplace laws.",leewardisle,2025-04-13T14:18:13,10

"Imo, greed is in human nature, even in the most selfless people. Even economics recognizes it, but in a different terminology (“the invisible hand” - continuous, self-directed desires that drive humans to create a demand/supply). That doesn’t mean everyone *is* greedy, but more of spectrum of potentials that vary from person to person that can be controlled with personal values and such. Most people have the potential to use it for good, bad, somewhere in between,imo.   Law should respect our inherent freedoms as humans, like the freedom to live. But it should step in when a human becomes so greedy, it harms others. Ie, overhunting. With Trump, those independent safeguards are being removed bit by bit.",leewardisle,2025-04-13T14:06:15,6

EOs are supposed to be how the president directs his branch to carry out the will of congress or in certain situations act fast while congress is getting it's bearings on a situation.  That's why he declared an emergency to be able to act with the power congress gave presidents to be able to react quickly to provide temporary remedies while congress works on the more permanent one.  We need to limit and define what is an actual emergency and not made up ones.,amazinglover,2025-04-13T14:48:58,8

"No.  People generally do not change their core beliefs, and if they do, they likely were not solid beliefs to begin with.  How these beliefs surface and present to the world can adopt to new realities, but the core doesn't change much.  For example, if a MAGA switches sides, they will most likely still be conspiracy driven, just that the target of conspiracy changes.  But, they would still be about the working class, anti elite, an outsider, etc.   On the other hand, if they vote Dem, which is what I think you are asking, they will still be Conservatives overall, just ones that perhaps voted out of spite, for their pocket books, etc.   If a recession hits, not matter what Trump does, Republicans will lose.",crucial_geek,2025-04-15T09:17:14,2
