I wonder how many of Trump’s decisions can be attributed to having a poopy diaper that day?,Marginallyhuman,2025-05-09T09:18:48,5

I would have been given an F in high school math with an answer that ended with “seems right”. Show your work Trump.,Big-Plankton-4484,2025-05-09T11:54:55,1
Great. Economic policy by vibes. Just what we need.,mdj,2025-05-09T13:41:44,1
China will demand zero tariffs with a threat to increase drawing down on its massive reserves of US Treasury bonds .   Trump will have to chew on the prospect of a steadily sinking dollar in addition to his inflationary tariffs.  His stupid trade war was lost before it began,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-09T09:16:58,9

"Every single thing he says and does is to escape the reality of himself. It’s a minute-by-minute, grotesque coping mechanism   HOW is there STILL people who try to analyze and interpret what he says and does?   It’s wild witnessing Billionaires/Business Leaders who are saying “OMG…there is NO  plan”   “Omg..Trump actually does not know what he’s talking about; he’s economically illiterate”   What did people think happened during Trump’s Pandemic?   The last time the US installed Trump into power - he caused over 920,400 PREVENTABLE deaths. Ffs!   Studies show that deaths over approx 100,000 - were preventable   Everything Trump Touches Dies   #ETTD   Trump corrupts everyone and everything around him  In order to ‘bend reality’ to satiate Trump’s insatiable self-delusions about himself  - people around him must be corrupted  Trump’s former lawyer explained that what happens is people get sucked into trying to save Trump from himself…while trying to appease him, which means endlessly corrupting oneself   I just don’t understand how people cannot easily recognize he is wearing no clothes   I’m going to go (even more) insane if MAGA doesn’t have to face the reality that THEY are the anti-American parasites who’ve made the US weak   As they screech “MERITOCRACY!” and “We’re WARRIORS!” and “WE ARE PATRIOTS!”…they are the weakest, most corrupt liars on EARTH   Anyway…sorry about the rant      He is THE most mocked human being on EARTH…while bragging that he’s the smartest person on the planet   How are Conservatives not embarrassed about their ‘hero’?",LYTCHELL2,2025-05-09T10:49:25,3

"Japan came out and said that Trump must stop lying about having Tariff negotiations that did NOT  happen   Japan then threatened to collapse the US Economy - by cashing in Bonds worth more than $TRILLION   Japan, our decades old friend and trading partner; Japan the most polite nation on Earth lol   Japan said that if Trump/US doesn’t stop making demands, issuing threats and attempting to blackmail their country - it’s curtains for the US Economy   Think of how vile they’re being if JAPAN announces they’ll collapse the US Economy   I LOVE that some other countries don’t have the pretend that Trump isn’t lying - they didn’t have to pretend Trump is smart or that the US holds all the cards   Trump has boxed himself into a corner - where his coercion and lies are being called out, on the world stage   I would sell my house and give away all my stuff and money - to be able to be able to watch everything that goes on behind the scenes in Trump world   His sycophants must be having to fellate him overtime   Omg…I would do anything to watch the madness behind closed doors  Think of all the paranoia and rage that’s ratcheting up   Do they KNOW that they’re the most mocked and despised imbeciles…on EARTH?   They are all monsters - out of control monsters   My god…the Beekeepers need to end this   They’re existence is weakening the US; we’re just another corrupt nation with a Tin Pot dictator   MAGA needs to repent…Jonestown-style",LYTCHELL2,2025-05-09T10:23:15,4
"Then he'll accept a deal that was worse than the one he tore up, he'll claim victory anyway, and anyone stupid enough to support him still will believe it.   Ya know, exactly what happened with every other trade agreement he worked on.",Richfor3,2025-05-09T09:35:46,3
Japan can do this too with even greater bond holdings which it can choose to yield to fund stimulus and support payments.   Neither Japan or China see it in their interests to withdraw completely and spark a global depression.   They do know that they can turn the screws on the USD until Trump squeals like a piglet.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-09T09:39:46,6

"Japan publicly threatened to withdraw their bond holdings ($TRILLION+) if Trump/US doesn’t stop making demands, threatening and trying to blackmail   Japan. Polite Japan who’s been a friend and trading partner with the US for decades   Republican US Senators called an airline in Ireland and demanded they purchase from Boeing and to cancel their order for planes from China…ummm? No   Trump admin is also ‘suggesting’ countries agree to Starlink - as part of Trade Deals   In conclusion: Trump is a fcking thug who is destroying the US   What did Republicans *think* was going to happen?   The MAGA Artifice is hurtling towards Reality…Propaganda is about to crash into The Laws of Nature/Physics/Universe   It always had to happen this way…Republican/Conservative Propaganda and the Zombified MAGAs need to be shocked into devastation   The Project 2025 White Ethno-State Power Grab needs to be Chernobyl-ed   EVERYTHING the Trump Admin is doing is to obliterate everything that helped black Americans get the foot into higher education, professional jobs etc   At what point is the whole Admin arrested for…everything they’re doing?   They didn’t take away the guns first…which is an oversight they will regret imho",LYTCHELL2,2025-05-09T10:35:03,4
