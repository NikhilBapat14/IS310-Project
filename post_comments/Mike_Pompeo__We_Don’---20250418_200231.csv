"President Trump has made clear that there is another option in the event there is no deal to be made: a military attack on Iran. I agree that this is the alternative. With Iran at its weakest point since the 1979 storming of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, such an attack could set back the Iranian nuclear program for a significant period, and Israel, Gulf allies, Europe, and the United States could carry this attack out in a manner that reduces the risk of a major Iranian response.  Iran’s closest allies—the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin—are not likely to come to Iran’s aid following such an attack, reducing risk still further. That Iran might use all of its proxies to respond to such an attack is indeed a risk. But what’s more likely is that so long as the strikes only target military and nuclear sites, Ayatollah Khamenei will not risk escalation.  It is worth recalling what happened when President Trump, in his first term, struck IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani. Many condemned the strike, suggesting that it would lead to World War III. Indeed, I was present when many career diplomats and servicemen said the Soleimani strike would result in a massive Iranian regional and global response.  But that’s not what happened. For the most part, Iran folded.  Why? Because the ayatollahs know President Trump would end the regime if a massive response from Iran was so much as tried.  Warning to Iran 🇮🇷: you make the wrong move and you could be obliterated.  The Iranian people do not support their regime.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T21:34:54,10
"Oddly specific warmongering, reminiscent of Bush era Iraq sabre rattling, didn't end well.",SeemoarAlpha,2025-04-18T23:21:22,14

Not going to lie I’m pretty disappointed at the amount of cheering going to war against Iran gets on here. It’s not like we don’t have decades of evidence as to why Middle East involvement is a bad idea.  “No you see this is actually the war we needed all along!” “This time it’s different!” Yeah okay sure.,EliteJassassin101,2025-04-19T12:02:44,3
