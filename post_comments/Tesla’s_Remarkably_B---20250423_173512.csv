It’s too late to fix this. Elon Musk will forever be associated with his Nazi salute and his support for this fascist administration.,animalslover4569,2025-04-23T17:38:19,1170
"Elon made the worst business decision ever in associating himself with fascism.

">  If Tesla’s future rests on left-leaning EV fans forgiving Musk for backing Trump, boosting the AfD party in Germany, and gleefully putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees out of work, then Musk may find himself longing for the days when his biggest problem was building a wild-looking stainless-steel truck.

Musk’s company effectively showed that country how to make modern EVs, and although Teslas still sell well enough there, Musk is up against dozens of new Tesla-like companies that have taken his ideas and run wild. Electric cars in China can be had with more advanced features than what Tesla offers, faster charging times, and more advanced approaches to automated driving.

They are gambling. Tesla is supposed to deliver on the Robotaxi thing in June. Everyone is thinking that if they'll deliver the company is gold again as it simply requires that they finally deliver on full self driving completely at long last.   They really fail to see how damaged the brand is by association to Musk. His return to active management is also likely to create more turmoil. And that the company has failed to deliver on FSD for a decade.  So June is likely the make or break point for most investors in Tesla.,Skastrik,2025-04-23T23:55:02,3

"Watching day-to-day swings in equities, in individual companies or even on much larger scales, especially in the current economic climate, is a fool's errand. In this specific instance, for example, there is no doubt Musk's psychotic break/midlife crisis has cast a large shadow over Tesla. But if you look at year-over-year, the stock itself is doing fine. And a ""Tesla didn't hit their numbers"" quarterly report is... actually not that unusual.  It's behaving like it always has, and that's to say erratically but with a general upward trend. People way smarter than me have been arguing about why that is, daily, for like ten years and then some, long before Musk drilled his way into politics and even before he started really letting loose with his uh... wacky public persona.  But the fact remains that the stock continues to appreciate; the numbers don't lie. That it's not at its highest one-day peak or one of its ten highest one-day peaks means literally nothing in the long-term. It's just a data point. And while earnings reports can substantially affect stock prices in the short term, generally there's a lot of regression to the mean.  People can ""blame"" that on whatever they like (and have, and will); emotions run pretty high - especially now - when talking about Tesla. But any talk about market movements related to one-day events is just noise, even if it's true. Tesla being case in point - it soared after the election, but has since shed a lot of those gains. You could blame all of that movement on a lot of things. Trump winning the election. Musk being a fucking Nazi. Trump buying a car from a Nazi. Trump inviting the Nazi home for dinner. A bad quarter. I mean, the list goes on.  But again, it's just noise. It's raindrops in an ocean. If you were to sell your Tesla stock *today* that you bought ten years ago, you're gonna come out pretty damned well on that ROI. But the important takeaway is that that's got nothing to do with *today*, at all.

"This is not necessarily true. He agreed to put his name to a lot of very unpopular things believing that he would magically get away with them because of his political affiliations.

But he has chosen to affiliate himself with a group of people who have a tendency to turn on their allies when politically convenient.

"Oh ya, I'm aware. :) If you make a comment on this sub that isn't straight Musk-hate train, you're gonna get blow back, regardless of whether you're literally just quoting figures, and no matter how many times you make a point to call him a Nazi in anticipation of that fact.  But yeah, to the meat of what you're saying, I think the long-lasting effects of Musk's ""popularity"" on his companies' financials has really yet to be seen. We'll get that whole picture one day, but not for a bit yet. Several quarters from now have me pretty curious. He's so much more high-profile than even during his weird ""I'm hate-buying Twitter"" days. I mean people are spray painting and/or buying those cars based on political ideology. That's a whole thing to unpack, and not something really priced into a stock, right? XD  There's no way I'd buy Tesla stock right now; it's far too toxic. But I wouldn't sell it either. That said, if I had some and was going to sell it, right now would most certainly find me weighing the investment. And in that cold math-brain, it wouldn't be because of anything personally abhorrent that he said that I translated onto the company, but how that abhorrence might translate to dollars lost or gained by that company. Because that's how proper equities management works. It's like Exxon. Exxon doesn't give a f'k about saving the planet, but they'll invest in renewables because it makes them money. You don't buy a stock based on ideology. That's just not the (completely amoral) game.  And for that reason, I'm very leery of calling it a ""meme stock."" It's heavily inflated if you look at the P/E, and right now its name is dirt, like 99% because of Musk himself, particularly. But the first of those factors is driven by market interest in the sense of long-term investment. It's really the pitch-perfect example of how many tech and investor capital-driven stocks operate, but there are plenty of companies that, while admittedly not that skewed, are far above what is considered an acceptable P/E (Amazon, Netflix, to name a couple), and they're considered good investments.  There are also a bunch of institutional investors attached to Tesla. Like big names. Vanguard. JP Morgan. And that means that trickles down to investment portfolios, maybe 401ks (not sure about that particularly; I'd have to dig, but there are definitely popular Vanguard ETFs with Tesla in them). There are plenty of people that own some Tesla stock and likely don't even know it. Financial institutions (currently) have faith in them. That's just the way that is. It's rather silly to hear people talk about ""tech bros"" and ideological shifts in the stock's value and whatnot. The people moving Tesla's share price aren't people with blind Tesla loyalty, trying to bump a stock on faith alone; they're institutional mercenaries-by-trade trying to make money. And some of them are robots. \^\^  The second factor though is directly related to something functionally outside anything to do with the company itself or even the sphere they're operating in. The brand is essentially at the mercy of ""external"" factors. That's a weird sentence to deconstruct to be so short, but that's essentially what's going on - their psycho CEO is literally doing anything but Tesla, and that spectacle has a not-at-all arbitrary effect on the company, but more so because of the nervousness it introduces into institutional investors, those really moving the stock. Is that sort of similar to the shifts in movement you see in instances of meme stocks, functionally driven by the news and its namesake? Yeah, it kinda is, in a way. But on a different scale. For a different audience. But again, that's only really been seen for the last quarter. Musk has been Reddit's favorite darling to hate (and, ya know, for good reason) for a while, but he wasn't making consistent headlines related to cultural zeitgeists and tearing down federal institutions for the lulz (there really is a lot of lulz for it not to be a meme stock...) until really the last six months. How that will affect things downstream for a particularly known-for-being-volatile stock? Yeah, that's the question.  And again, all of this is just bias-free, macro-level thinking. From a pure probabilities standpoint, for a speculator, eh, any day is a good day to buy and/or sell Tesla. For someone who bought it ten years ago hoping frumpy Tony Stark would save the world, it probably tastes like very valuable ashes in their mouths, and they're left to sit there and let their two wolves do their thing. Do any of those individual motives or outcomes mean much? Nope. The pool's too big. It's just a different scale. The man is a hate-filled piece of shit and should be loathed. But yeah, we can be dispassionately cognizant of how things work (generally more important) and still get on with the loathing. \^\^",builttopostthis6,2025-04-24T17:57:02,1
