">**“**I’m considering a $1 trillion lawsuit!” the blogger joked Wednesday to Axios, [which was first to report the site’s launch](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/trump-white-house-drudge-style-website-launch).  >On Thursday, the lead headline on the Drudge Report read: “TRUMP LAUNCHING HIS OWN DRUDGE REPORT WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS.”  Ha",64OunceCoffee,2025-05-01T12:32:10,11
"So taxpayer money will be misused to fund fascist propaganda and amplify Russian disinformation campaigns. If only there were some kind of functioning oversight.  By capturing the White House, trump can now use the resources of the United States against itself. The general public enabling its own slide into hell.",charcoalist,2025-05-01T13:07:25,7

The irony here is that if Matt Drudge were still alive he’d spend every day pointing out a new illegal thing the Trump administration has done. The fact this is being done without a hint of irony just highlights how incredibly stupid these people are.,TheCairoKing,2025-05-01T11:55:31,16
"they know that outside of their propaganda bubble, shit is not going well.  They are trying to drive people to the propaganda as opposed to Drudge and sites like it.  I'm definitely left and I have come to depend on Drudge Report for news as they, as crazy as it sounds, are the most unbiased news source around.",2cigsaday,2025-05-01T12:09:35,7

"um, he is alive?",2cigsaday,2025-05-01T12:10:14,12
That's what I'm saying.   Believe it or not... There were a few days prior to the election that Drudge actually reported some bad news about Trump. But only a few.,williamgman,2025-05-01T12:11:02,3
"> I'm definitely left and I have come to depend on Drudge Report for news as they, as crazy as it sounds, are the most unbiased news source around.   They have some original content, but they mostly just link to articles from maintstream outlets. This is like saying reddit is the most unbiased news source around. It's not a news source, it's an aggregator.",veggeble,2025-05-01T12:16:40,10

"Drudge Report consistently criticizes Trump. Or rather, simply links to articles about him that report reality. It has for some time now.",Quiet_Version5406,2025-05-01T16:58:56,2
"but they choose what I think are basic and unbiased purveyor of news.  Just the story, no opinion.  Not all , but most, especially as of late, as in, since Trump took office again.",2cigsaday,2025-05-01T15:45:08,2
Eh. You were probably thinking of Breitbart. He is dead.,sdcinerama,2025-05-01T12:22:33,9
Interesting. Have not looked at it in a long time. Reddit headlines cover most everything Drudge's algorithm harvests.,williamgman,2025-05-01T18:44:54,5
Totally. Used to be my source for conservative news to get a balanced diet and attempt to understand the right. Definitely more center now. Cheers,Quiet_Version5406,2025-05-01T18:48:50,3
