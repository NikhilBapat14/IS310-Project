Trump wants Greenland and Canada because on a map they are drawn as 2 of the largest landmasses. He's basing his desires on a misunderstanding of scale on a map,Walker_ID,2025-05-10T08:40:51,18
">Sources speaking to Reuters have revealed that White House officials are exploring a Compact of Free Association with the Danish territory, an arrangement currently used with Pacific Island nations such as Micronesia, Palau, and the Marshall Islands.\ >Under a COFA deal, the U.S. would provide Greenland with essential services, military protection, and largely duty-free trade, though the island would maintain its independence.\ >… That said, such a deal would still face a number of practical hurdles, notably that Greenland would likely need to separate from Denmark in order to sign. Polls have shown that the 57,000 inhabitants of the island are interested in independence, but they overwhelmingly do not want to be part of the U.S.\ >… Republican lawmakers have previously opposed funding allocations to these territories, leading to frustrations in the countries that rely on the money.",livelaughoral,2025-05-10T06:06:16,15
"Hey Greenland (and Denmark while we're at it), mind temporarily evicting the US military from that base they have?

Greenlanders should look at how the us treats Puerto Rico and Guam residents before they ever make a deal like that. Not that they would.,StrengthFew9197,2025-05-10T09:16:51,9
