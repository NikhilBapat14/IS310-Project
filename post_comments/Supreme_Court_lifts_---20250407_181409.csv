">In a bitterly divided 5-4 decision, the court said the migrants still must get a chance to challenge their deportation before they are taken out of the country and said the Trump administration must give them “reasonable time” to go to court.  >But the conservative majority said the legal challenges must take place in Texas, instead of a Washington courtroom.",SicilianShelving,2025-04-07T18:17:58,1

"You can deport someone without due process and if you are found to have been wrong about their status, they cannot be ordered back by the courts. That is what they Supreme Court decided today. Which is to say: there are no such things as rights in this country. They found the loophole that can deny them for anyone.",SadBadPuppyDad,2025-04-07T18:21:56,1

Cool. POTUS can now just declare that there’s a war against the US to deport anyone he wants. Very cool. ,Huge_Rich522,2025-04-07T18:50:44,1

This is ultimately not about immigration or Venezuelans.  It's really about the administration's power to do anything that it wants by claiming that it's an emergency.  There should be no wartime powers.  There is no war.,I405CA,2025-04-07T18:33:29,1

Quite a day for the Supreme Court. First they say the US doesn't have to return the innocent man they deported to a brutal prison labor camp in El Salvador and then they said that Trump can continue to deport immigrants using the Alien Enemies Act.,captaincanada84,2025-04-07T19:32:10,1

Hot take: that’s actually a subtle win.   The entire point of this for the administration was to jetset brown people regardless of whether they did anything wrong.   This will likely reduce the appetite of deportations from the administration because every loss in court will hurt their optics and it slows them down.,FawningDeer37,2025-04-07T18:25:02,1

"Except it's not giving affected individuals due process as a matter of course. It requires them to file a habeas petition, which requires legal resources. Additionally, it's unclear what a ""reasonable time"" to file a habeas means. 24 hour? 12 hours? I'm sure the administration will press that to the limit. And certainly this gives the administration incentive to hastily whisk detainees to favorable venues, we'll see more folks detained in the wee hours of the night and immediately flown elsewhere.  Finally, what happens after deported individuals are in CECOT? This opinion makes it sound like at that point, too bad, it's too late to do anything! The Garcia case (the Maryland father) will require the court to confront that directly, but this opinion doesn't make me optimistic.  I doubt this will deter anything, it's more one of those opinions John Roberts is so proud of because he thinks it makes him sound reasonable, only to be upset when he realizes the charade doesn't fool anyone.",supes1,2025-04-07T18:52:23,1
"This does at least return a minor amount of due process to this whole ordeal.  SCOTUS can't outright rule the 1798 law invalid. The ability granted to POTUS to declare terrorists by Congress allows it to be faux legitimized.

Two decisions were made. Appeals courts can't issue emergency stays when someone has been placed in peril by being illegally removed from the country without due process and appeals courts can't issue emergency stays when someone's due process rights have been compromised. It must all be adjudicated at some undetermined future date while a person's rights continue to be violated.,SadBadPuppyDad,2025-04-07T19:27:20,1
