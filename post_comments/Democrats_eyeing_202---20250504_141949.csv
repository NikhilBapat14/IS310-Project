I don’t think the manosphere is that hard to crack it is just democrats would have to say things they don’t believe.

His point is: Our message can't just be for people watching MSNBC. If we can't take it to Fox news and defend it well, it shouldn't be our message.   That doesn't mean we surrender on trans rights and library closures. It means we better understand and define *why these things are important.*",Mindless-Pogram,2025-05-04T14:29:31,22

The majority of society is not swayed by intellectual debate rational behavior.    A person can be smart, patient, and rational. People together ARE stupid, impatient, and reactionary.

Recognition is important, you need celebrities and social media influencers that are already known and already popular to engage a population that hates learning new information or searching for answers. Vitriol, you need your supporters to HATE the opposition so much that no half measures are entertained, and that whips everyone into a fury to rally against.    The right has successfully radicalized their base. And seduced a disengaged general populace with easy to digest material and plain speech threats and insults. They are not doing anything different than in the past policy wise, but they have convinced people that not going along makes you evil. The left continues to try to intellectually persuade people that are too busy staring at social media and youtube ""sources"" to care. The left needs to be re-branded, and neo-liberals (which I can't believe is even a term because pro-business and pro-people, are not able to coexist) need to stop catering to businesses, or stop existing. ",That-Butter,2025-05-04T15:38:42,3

">you need celebrities and social media influencers that are already known  This is completely false. Democrats have used celebrities and star power multiple times over the last few election cycles and it has never helped voter turnout.

"But that is exactly the problem. It IS the terminally online and youth vote that failed the left the most. There is very little in the way of a voice on the left that appeals to these groups, especially young men. This is an angry group of people, and the right gave them a target for that anger, and one that was gonna divide the left, Israel.   All the while, the internet presence on the right has been fostering resentment in white men by fueling their fears about identity politics. The real idea behind being ""woke"" is supposed to be that everyone should get the same treatment. This is, of course, a noble goal, and bigotry is disgusting. As a movement, however, it became about shaming people, which surprise, surprise is a horrible and short-term fix to a problem. Add to that safe places and triggers, and whole world telling you how fucking good you have it, while people of any color, or identity all across this country are struggling to get by working jobs, and making salaries that used to nearly guarantee a comfortable life. And people get angry.   White men specifically are constantly afraid to say or do the wrong thing and how doing so could destroy their lives that they are barely holding together in the first place. Now, every voice in their, yes terminally online, world that sounds like them or empathizes with their situation is on the opposite side. Who are they going to listen to? Who is a 19 year old stuffed to the gills with testosterone, or 50 year old men who are likewise filled with testosterone because they have been convinced that low T is a thing? Are they going to want to get talked down to by people flaunting their righteousness on cable TV (which they dont pay for btw), or Roid Rage Rogan who stuffs his show, an internet podcast, with quasi intellectuals who cuss and validate the audiences fear. This is how you make a civil rights activist into a passive racist   In honor of May 4th, I'll make a Star Wars reference, the right is the darkside, and fear is the path to the darkside.
