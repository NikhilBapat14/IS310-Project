"None of these people should be voting or passing any pro-crypto legislation unless they're actually capable of sitting down and explaining to their constituents what crypto currency and the block chain are, how they work, and what their environmental impacts are. If they can't do that, then they shouldn't be voting or passing any pro-crypto laws.",valamaladroit,2025-05-08T05:43:34,16
The idea of a Bitcoin reserve sounds like a very idiotic idea. Why would the government reserve Bitcoin? What is the use? What is the purpose? Is Bitcoin disappearing? What is the practical reason to have a reserve? Why don’t we make an Euro reserve? How about a horse manure reserve? That would be more important to reserve.,NeoThorrus,2025-05-08T06:02:00,9
Expected better out of her. But guess making sure the outside spending by crypto folks doesn't consolidate around KTR/Biggs in 2026 might have an impact.,hunter15991,2025-05-08T06:08:53,3

"I think they're just playing at shitty hedge fund managers. Now ten years ago - bitcoin would have been a helluva play. Now? Meh. They're late to the game.    Looks mid to me.   If you really want a soveirgn wealth fund - which is what I think these derps mean by ""strategic reserve"" - invest in actual industries. Do so with the coordination of the state. Put someone who's an actual proven investor in charge of it. I think that's a pretty cool idea.    ",Voaracious,2025-05-08T06:29:45,4
