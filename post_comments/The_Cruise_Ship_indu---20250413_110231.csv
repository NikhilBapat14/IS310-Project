I would think that if I offered the public an expensive service I would cover all the bases in making it safe and lovely for my clients.,Techelife,2025-04-13T15:32:29,1

I was planning a cruise with my wife. We’ve just decided to change the plans to a resort up in the Poconos. I’ll never set foot on a cruise ship again until it’s fixed and I’ve done a bunch of cruises. Good news for the cruise lines stock when the first people start dying on board.,DeepFawkes,2025-04-13T14:07:10,6
Many of the cruise ships are based in countries like Jamaica so they can only pay employees $3.75 an hour.  They care about making a profit first and then employees and passengers.,phxees,2025-04-13T16:04:10,1

Which is a shame because honestly if we had ways to help maintain our home financially while away on vacation a cruise ship isn’t bad way to break up a few months out of a year or just monotony of life.   Maybe that’s why it’s mostly boomers and landlords that go on cruise ships,Oraxy51,2025-04-13T15:54:09,2
