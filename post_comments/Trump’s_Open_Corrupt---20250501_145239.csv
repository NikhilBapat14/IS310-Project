"""The Trump family’s cryptocurrency business just got a $2 billion investment from a firm backed by the United Arab Emirates government. The deal is rife with conflicts of interest.""  ""Zach Witkoff—son of Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and founder of the Trump family’s crypto firm, World Liberty Financial—[announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/01/us/politics/trump-cryptocurrency-usd1-dubai-conference-announcement.html) the deal at a conference in Dubai on Thursday. He was accompanied by Eric Trump, who runs his family’s business.""  ""This is a massive donation from a foreign government to the Trump family that will ultimately go toward a crypto exchange that has been monitored by the U.S. government for two years for money laundering. Binance’s billionaire founder, Changpeng Zhao, has not so coincidentally been pushing for a Trump pardon after he pleaded guilty in 2023 to violating anti-money-laundering laws.""  ""With this deal, the Trump family will be enriched beyond most people’s comprehension, and they have the UAE government to thank for it. One can predict that Trump is likely to treat the country very favorably from here on out, again demonstrating that his power does have a price.""  ""Trump changed his tune on cryptocurrency and used it to raise millions of dollars for his last campaign. His firm has been incredibly lucrative since, and as Witkoff said, it’s only the beginning. This current venture is an instance of Trump further thumbing his nose at our flimsy conflict of interest laws and selling his influence to the highest bidder.""",ChiGuy6124,2025-05-01T14:53:43,643

"Well, after mass peaceful protests there is the peaceful option of nationwide general strike (every industry and service) on conditions of Trump and MAGA being arrested and held for trial. This would eventually grind the economy to a halt, and put pressure where it's needed. However I can imagine the Trump government could try to arrest random people and force them into slavery. Alternatively, life will get much more oppressively difficult in different ways anyway for many, in the wait-4-years approach.",Beerden,2025-05-02T14:25:20,1
