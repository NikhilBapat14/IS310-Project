There is at least one mistake in this chart. One of the top ten drops was under President Biden. There is a Wikipedia table with this information if you want to make your own list.

"Just a note of caution, because critics will point this out: remember the March 2020 ones were because of the start of the pandemic, and global stock markets all crashed everywhere.¬†   It was before any country's government formed (or didn't form) policies to address the panic of the start of COVID.   I wouldn't pin that on the US government anymore than I'd pin the TSX or Nikkei crashing at the same time on the Canadian or Japanese governments at the time.¬†   Everyone was in a panic and everything was crashing faster than people or governments could respond.",JustAskingTA,2025-04-05T12:18:24,2

"The biggest stock market drop under President Biden occurred during the bear market of 2022, when the S&P 500 fell by **19%** and the NASDAQ dropped by **33%.** This decline was largely attributed to external factors, such as **Russia's invasion of Ukraine**, soaring inflation, and the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. While Biden's policies, like the Inflation Reduction Act, influenced certain sectors of the economy, the stock market's performance was primarily driven by global events and monetary policy.",Metiche76,2025-04-05T11:02:53,15
