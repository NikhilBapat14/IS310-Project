"As far as I know he could still be extradited to the Hague.  I'm pretty sure US asylum laws don't provide any special protection against war crimes extradition requests; and those other things are only about protecting US citizens, not about asylees or others.  It'd be mostly up to whoever's president at the time I'd think, and could change as the presidency changes.  At any rate that customer has no idea what they're talking about as Putin would never be allowed asylum in the US, nor would he accept if it were offered.",zlefin_actual,2023-06-29T18:46:25,1
