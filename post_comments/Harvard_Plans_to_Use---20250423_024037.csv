"It takes a special kind of stupid to not only take on a school known for its legal prowess, but to also do so in a haphazard and sloppy way. I hope the administration is mired in legal battles so much they are gridlocked. They’ve been callously playing with people’s lives and need a quick wake up call to remember that actions have consequences, and that THEY serve US.",ApplicationAfraid334,2025-04-23T03:00:47,60

"> “If you lose ultimately at the court but millions of people now believe that all of these institutions are hotbeds of discrimination, that they don’t provide any benefits to the communities in which they operate, that they don’t produce anything of value,” she said, adding, “that might be a win if you are hostile to higher education institutions.”  I don't think there's any significant number of people whose opinion of Harvard was or will be changed by Trump's allegations against it.   Bubba Maga was never Harvard's core audience anyway.  And I suspect even Jewish Ivy League students aren't thinking they ""don’t provide any benefits to the communities in which they operate"" they just want to see leadership take a different stance on the Palestinian protests.   How many Jews are dropping out of Harvard and Yale and going to state schools in Florida that DeSantis has gutted of all intellectualism?",NinjaLanternShark,2025-04-23T04:19:50,12

"“It takes a special kind of stupid to not only take on a school known for its legal prowess, but to also do so in a haphazard and sloppy way.“  That’s basically Yarvin 101 in a nutshell.",jim_bones,2025-04-23T05:54:18,22
">How many Jews are dropping out of Harvard and Yale and going to state schools in Florida that DeSantis has gutted of all intellectualism?  Good luck to them. In a few years time, if the professional world doesn’t take them seriously, they’ll have no one to blame but themselves.   Imagine an election for the leader of an entire country being significantly impacted by the drama of some tiny-ass other country thousands of miles away.   The entire USA willing to sink itself to not upset the Bibi regime. Absolutely insane.",Useful_Document_4120,2025-04-23T07:42:05,4
Do they need to? Can courts force Trump to give them funds?,OmegaKitty1,2025-04-23T07:50:13,1
"Don't need to get the courts to do it. They can make things so miserable for Trump, he deals with them to make them stop. I doubt they're gonna stop at the funding issue, either.",whichwitch9,2025-04-23T08:12:13,3
"What I mean is they can fill the court with so much paperwork and whatever they do. Since I think DOJ don’t have enough experience in dealing w this. However, Trump does have big law firm offering help for free.",Patient-01,2025-04-24T01:45:16,1
