"I don’t like the idea of any of the prisoners going down there not just Garcia. I am sure some of them are MS13, I’m in no way saying they should all go free. But they should be throughly investigated first. Also shipping our prisoners to foreign countries is a very bad idea.",blellowbabka,2025-04-18T12:32:42,28

What about the hair stylist? Why aren’t they trying to help him.,jUleOn64,2025-04-18T10:20:46,23
Well let’s hope the counterterrorism czar isn’t gonna try some BS if they are able to extract Abrego Garcia… because of course they would,thatnextquote,2025-04-18T07:51:27,5

"While I am grateful some work is being done, I am afraid they are making this too focused a one individual to the detriment of other innocent people sent there. Like others have said, Andry Hernandez Romero (often referred to as the hairdresser) has no business at all being at CECOT, or even being deported as he was in the middle of a legal asylum application process. And I know there are other similar cases too in the 100s that were sent there. This singular focus, while I’m grateful it exists at all, feels concerningly bandwagon. Suppose Kilmer is released, I don’t want our democratic reps to say case closed, pat themselves on the back, and leave innocent people to die forgotten in a supermax. ",Calm_Pudding2684,2025-04-19T15:51:17,3
Cory Booker gives me more faith in humanity than I've had in a long time. He's a real one.,Frickin_Brat,2025-04-20T01:42:43,2
That’s what due process is supposed to be for,[deleted],2025-04-18T13:54:38,23
They need to. Kilmar just became the face because the administration literally said “yeah whoops we fucked that up” in court and it’s a lot easier to point to that than to prove a negative.,irrelevantanonymous,2025-04-18T21:47:39,6
"They need to expand this focus on more people. Make it clear that Kilmar is not a one off situation, he just happened to get a clear admission to the Supreme Court that he was a mistake. Andrys does not deserve to be in that prison. He was escaping persecution to come to America and contributing to society. He should be in America, but if you are going to insist on being cruel and draconian, at least do it legally and send him back as a free man.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-18T16:37:54,5
"The more elected politicians that go there to demand his release, puts pressure on Trump and keeps this in the media. This is a good thing.",Spaceman-Spiff,2025-04-18T08:10:00,50
Yes a bunch of others are joining him as well. I think Van Hollen wanted to get down there while Garcia is still a hot topic which was a great choice.,GangstaHoodrat,2025-04-18T07:35:03,29

"“Organizing” and “will lead a trip” both suggest he’s planning to take more people with him. Chris got the ball rolling, and now Cory is catching the ball and running it down the field. This is a good thing.",diaymujer,2025-04-18T09:42:32,37
"They need to create political costs to Bukele locally as well. They are drumming up attention, keeping it in the news here, but also showing the people of El Salvador that their government is imprisoning innocent people. They need to know that the initial suspension of laws to crack down on gangs has turned into political arrests.",ICanLiftACarUp,2025-04-18T08:29:20,11
"I dunno if it'll work, you've got half the country who thinks dude is a terrorist gang member and the worst person on the planet, hell there was even more pressure to fire or hold ppl accountable for signal gate even from republicans and that went absolutely nowhere, this administration doesn't give a shit",FickleSystem,2025-04-18T12:58:46,1
I guess I’m just not overwhelmingly impressed by the opportune theatrics of Cory Booker,rpd9803,2025-04-18T09:39:23,-10
"Who cares whether or not it’s a case of opportune theatrics? Either way, it’s a good thing and puts more pressure on the administration.",LittlePurpleS,2025-04-18T09:44:26,9
