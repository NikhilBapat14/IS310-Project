"To all the Dem strategists reading this, you are so bad at your jobs if you think ANYONE is falling for these tactics. Even my MOM isn't.  Corporate stooges like you ARE the problem. You can't thinktank your way out of this, and paint aesthetics over the problem. You get on board, or you get out of the way. Those are your options. Elissa Slotkin is not the future of this party, literally nobody will ever think this outside your little consultant bubbles.",TheGroinOfTheFace,2025-05-09T12:05:16,18
