"John McLaughlin apparently told him the polls were purposely malicious because of the random respondents, only 37% said they voted for Trump.   A cynical person might believe that’s because not as many people actually voted for Trump as the final results told us. It might be because the election polls were more correct than the outcome, and that the phenomena of Trump winning all five swing states wasn’t naturally occurring.   Or it might just be post-election embarrassment, and 7% of Trump voters are now in denial.",70sBurnOut,2025-04-28T17:09:43,15

"I’m staunchly anti Trump but haven’t polls (elections polls) been pretty wrong? If I recall most were predicting a Trump loss in 2024, or at least a narrow margin, yet here we are. I don’t know why anyone trusts any polls these days honestly…",VERGExILL,2025-04-29T07:38:44,1

True. Some polls also only include registered voters (or those who say they are). All of the major ones do ask for party affiliation though so they can break down R/I/D numbers.,70sBurnOut,2025-04-28T18:02:47,2
