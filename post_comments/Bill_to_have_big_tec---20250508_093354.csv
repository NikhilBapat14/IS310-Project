Obnoxious big government intrusion.   Propping up failing corrupt local businesses.  Tech should threaten to stop serving that state.,box-cable,2025-05-08T09:37:38,-10
"It’s not about “big government intrusion” or “propping up corrupt businesses.” It’s about addressing a long-term structural imbalance. Tech platforms extract immense value from local journalism without compensating the producers. Local newsrooms spend time and money to do original reporting, but when that content is surfaced by search engines and social feeds, the platforms get the traffic and ad revenue.  Many local newsrooms aren’t failing because of corruption or incompetence—they’re struggling because their traditional revenue streams have been disrupted by tech’s dominance in digital advertising. Asking tech companies to pay a fair share for content they benefit from isn’t extortion; it’s closer to leveling the playing field.  As for the idea that tech should “stop serving the state”—that’s not a credible threat. It’s akin to saying they’ll punish users for their governments’ attempts to protect public goods. It’s a move that would further prove the need for regulation, not disprove it.",Conscious-Quarter423,2025-05-08T09:47:09,4
"yeah let's worry about ""big gubment"" making the rich pay their fair share and ignore the current administration that is literally trying to disappear US citizens and firing teachers over showing basic respect to trans kids.",monosuperboss1,2025-05-08T10:43:56,2
"> Tech platforms extract immense value from local journalism  The media industry, namely companies like Alden and Gannett who own most local news outlets, put out these kinds of narratives because they want free money at the expense of tech companies. The value flows mostly one-way; news outlets benefit immensely from being visible on platforms, and not the other way around. Case in point: when Facebook turned off news in Canada, [it didn’t impact FB traffic at all](https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-canada-news-ban-fails-dent-facebook-usage-2023-08-29/), but hurt Canadian publishers significantly. Moreover, especially in the case of FB but also X and YouTube, the platforms don’t share news content, their users do (including the publishers themselves, who promote their own stories on their social media accounts). Should platforms pay for content that they don’t even post?  As for Google, they don’t make money through search ads off of news websites, because ads don’t appear in news queries. All they do is link out to news websites, which get something like 30-40% of their traffic from Google searches. In all of these “link tax” bills, where do they account for the value of this referral traffic? On the display ads side (the ads that show up on the websites themselves that Google serves), Google just lost a federal antitrust suit, and will likely have to spin out parts of their ad tech business. This seems like a much more effective way of fixing that problem than imposing arbitrary rents on tech companies, and making news publishers even more beholden to big tech.  > They’re struggling because their traditional revenue streams have been disrupted by tech’s dominance in digital advertising  They’re struggling because their traditional revenue streams have been disrupted by the internet in general. Local news’ traditional revenue came from having regional ad monopolies in their respective markets. The internet exposed them to competition from news outlets all over the world, and so their monopoly profits were impacted. Companies like Alden and Gannett proceeded to scoop up local outlets, lay off most of their staff, and continue milking whatever (ever reducing) revenue they could from them.  > As for the idea that tech should “stop serving the state”  Yeah, I think they should. Better to pull out of a state than pay arbitrary taxes to greedy hedge funds that are only likely to lobby for more.",Independent-End-2443,2025-05-08T11:26:45,1
