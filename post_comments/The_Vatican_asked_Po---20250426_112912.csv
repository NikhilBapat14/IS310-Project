"The Pope's widow asked me to wear a blue suit so that she could have an easier time finding me so she could thank me and make a deal. That's what they don't tell you. People come up to me all the time, mourners who never cried even at the Pope's funeral, they come up to me with tears in their eyes and they say ""Sir, why is the fake news saying that you wore a blue suit?"" And I tell them it's because everyone knows I was greatly disrespected by not being put in the first row. But I mourned harder than anyone else at the funeral. Frankly, in many ways I wore the blackest suit anyone had ever seen. It was so black that they were lining up to kiss my ass and make a deal. I made 200, maybe 300 deals just during the funeral. Even the new Pope wanted to make a deal. All I needed for that deal was some gift cards, so you're all very proud of me for making such an amazing deal while wearing the blackest suit.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-26T15:38:45,6

"No, do not spew lies to reinforce your point of view and claim it's fact. If you don't like or agree with someone, that's of course fine, but do not casually make stuff up and twist reality to suit a narrative you want to push, which then gets pushed by others and accepted as fact. By peddling lies and misinformation, you are no better than what you claim to be against.  Fact: Trump never ""*complained that Zelensky disrespected HIM by showing up at the White House dressed in something other than a business suit*"". There is zero evidence of him complaining or saying Zelenskyy disrespected him by his choice of attire. Instead it's the opposite, yet you attempt to stray even further from the truth and exaggerate with claiming it was a '*nasty dig*'.  Fact: Your ""source"" is based entirely on Trump saying to Zelenskyy “*You’re all dressed up today*” upon first meeting him. It then shows an edited clip of Trump and Zelenskyy arguing, further pushing the clickbait 'trump bad' narrative.  Fact: Despite clearly having access to the white house footage that day, your ""source"" conveniently left out:  \- The fact that Trump smiled at Zelenskeyy's reply to the reporter who questioned his lack of suit.  \- The fact that Trump actually went back on his own accord a few mins later after the question to defend and compliment Zelenskyy's clothing, lighten the tone and touch his shoulder.  \- The fact that Trump smiled and said ""*That's a good statement*"" when Zelenskyy said he has more serious things than reply to those kinds of questions.  So no, what you said was false. Trump said the 'dressed up' comment originally, which of course was sarcastic, while smiling and said with humor. Trump jokes and is sarcastic regularly – that's his daily personality. What you have done is take this 1 comment in isolation with 1 specific interpretation, fabricated the claim that Trump complained Zelenskyy disrespected him, and weave it into your comments to push your narrative, then provide a ""source"" that is clearly biased (pretty obvious from the headline alone ""*No suit, no lunch, no respect*"") and conveniently leaves out the original context and actual facts, facts of which completely debunk the article's narrative.  I don't agree with Trump on many things. It doesn't matter whether you or I like/dislike someone. Facts are important.  Did you also peddle the 'fine people on both sides' lie? Or the 'there will be a bloodbath if Trump doesn't win' lie? Or the 'Trump rudely dumps food in Japanese koi fish pond' lie? Or the 'Trump abruptly interrupts Starmer' lie? Or any of the other continuous media lies?

You'll get no argument from me that Trump was disrespectful, that's pretty much is default. A scorpion will be scorpion.  The rhetoric in this country has become a race to the bottom. Rather than focus on the issues we're naming calling and acting like TMZ looking for the latest thing to be outraged over. Trump's base loves the trolling and the outrage that follows. It doesn't help. Your choice of words, ""Going high when they go low"" even suggests that you're in your own echo chamber, no different from maga.  Where do you draw the line when it comes to lowering yourself to their level? Should liberally-aligned billionaires insert themselves further into the democratic process? Should Dems gerrymander as much as they can? Should they lie, cheat and steal because the ends justify the means?  Sorry, but I refuse to act like a petty asshole simply because everyone else is.

And then the man with a closet full of business suits for every occasion couldn't be bothered to respect the occasion by dressing in funeral black. He made his point.      Showing disrespect to others is a hallmark of Trump's personal brand. This was a relatively minor version, to be honest. Being shitty to people is daily, seemingly hourly for him. But it thrills his toxically masculine base and that got him elected to an office he's abused in every conceivable way.   As for his jibe about Zelensky's clothing, that isn't easily dismissed by ""just joking."" That's the pathetic pattern of abusers and bullies everywhere, being cruel for amusement and then ""taking it back."" Another perfect example: In February our dear leader called Zelensky  ""A Dictator without Elections"" and a week later said ""Did I say that? I can't believe I said that. Next question.""   Pathetic, cruel, abusive, and disingenuous.   And of course it's nothing new. Never forget his public statement on the very day of the  9/11 attacks.
