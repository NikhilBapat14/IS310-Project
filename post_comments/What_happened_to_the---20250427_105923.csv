There is no president. Only a fascist dictator¬†,Torracattos,2025-04-27T11:06:29,113
President Musk saw the Q1 results and realized he needed to go behind the scenes. So now he‚Äôs trying to be hands off while continuing to push white nationalism on X.  Want to see true corruption? Look at TSLAs stock performance versus Q1 results..,BrocksNumberOne,2025-04-27T11:21:47,72

I swear he's just mad Grimes left him and he's throwing a very elaborate and expensive mid life crisis titty baby fit.

His mom is probably over there yelling at him for being such a Debbie downer.,Traditional-Purpose2,2025-04-27T11:35:16,30
"I think 2 things: his car company is tanking, that's a big 1. The other thing is that he may have realized that, over time, he might be prosecuted for the illegal shit he did under Trump. I'd be worried for the long term consequences, if I were him.",5ervalkat,2025-04-27T11:42:34,20

"Omg what an awful yet perfect picture of the state we are in... Elon now terrified because everyone hates him. Trump a fat orange pussy. Still getting milked by his followers. Lmao America is such an embarrassment to the rest of the world. Yet there are people that still stand behind the ""fuck Brandon"" narrative. Lmao yall clowns. Hahahah grow up. Do research. Call it hive mind or call it whatever you want. America is a joke. And will be until we get an actual competent president that cares about the people and not just their own pockets.

"I think that both of them made a pact, to keep each other out of prison. Musk came along and bought the oval office back for trump, and trump handed over the keys to the gov departments that were investigating musk for his sketchy business practices.
