"If these are US citizens, when do we call this what it is? Ethnic cleansing?  When does the world openly identify the US as a fascist state? Let's see....what defines a fascist state?   ultranationalist political ideology  a dictatorial leader centralized autocracy militarism forcible suppression of opposition belief in a natural social hierarchy subordination of individual interests  The only point here people could contest is centralised autocracy - Roe Vs Wade or education being examples of Trump pushing decisions out to the States. However, when the States do something he disagrees with, they are threatened with legal action. Legal action where judges are either appointed by Trump or arrested for not carrying out his will.  If US citizens are just going to sit back and let all this happen, the future is extremely bleak.",Jensen1994,2025-04-26T02:58:28,94

"""The unborn"" are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don't resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don't ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don't need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don't bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. It's almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe.  Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.  -Barnhart",curiousleen,2025-04-26T10:21:11,3

"You're not listening to trump-supporting Christians, trump's 'anti-Christian bias' department, his new 'faith czar', Russell Vought, Anton Scalia, Mitch McConnell, Mike Johnson, powerful Christian entities like Liberty University or anything in Project2025. Not hard dots to connect to Christian Nationalism. I mean, that's the whole POV of trumpers: That we all have to believe the same things, look the same and work the same in order to be good Americans now.",debrabuck,2025-04-26T08:06:32,4

"My general overarching feeling is that conservatives are in a state of mass hysteria over a thing that isn’t really an enormous problem. Tens of millions of people have entered the country over the past couple decades and not much has changed. Nothing that warrants extreme measures anyway.   I do agree that the border should have been more secure which Biden and Trump have done via EO recently, and that deportations with due process, especially of criminals, is totally fine. The intentional cruelty is not necessary though. Our country is in fine shape, so I don’t see the need to play hardball with the families of 2 year old Americans with cancer. If their parents are here illegally, then yeah, they didn’t respect all our laws, but we can also choose how we want to respond to that and we can choose not to be sadistic about it since this isn’t a dire emergency. Secure the border so that we incentivize following the law when entering the country and so that we don’t have to make as many difficult decisions like this, and then try to be humane and pragmatic when a decision has to be made about people who did end up illegally getting through the border. ",StormOk7544,2025-04-27T08:43:00,1
"The issue is and always has been the State.   The State is in control, not Trump.   The bourgeoisie control the State, not Trump nor his admin.   He is just the current spokesperson.   But the propaganda is so good, most don't see the State, just the spokesperson.  In a few years, they change the spokesperson and the other side cheers. But the core State still exists to exploit and oppress the workers.",brightblueson,2025-04-26T12:32:23,0

"There's sufficient ""probable cause"" to hold Trump in criminal contempt right now. It's one of the powers of the Judiciary to sign warrants of seizure for People or Evidence, one I wish they would exercise.

I wouldn’t necessarily say it’s too late everywhere. People should still be informed on any upcoming local elections and any chance we still have to vote we need to take. Here in Louisiana voters just recently rejected 4 MAGA backed constitutional amendments that Mike Johnson was really keen on pushing through.

"Let me get this straight, you think that the current world order of a Bourgeois Dictatorship and the Bourgeoisie exploiting workers through labor and controlling the State is a conspiracy theory?  So, Marx and Lenin were conspiracy theorists?  Lenin spelled this out in The State and Revolution  Another reason why the omnipotence of “wealth” is more certain in a democratic republic is that it does not depend on defects in the political machinery or on the faulty political shell of capitalism. A democratic republic is the best possible political shell for capitalism, and, therefore, once capital has gained possession of this very best shell (through the Palchinskys, Chernovs, Tseretelis and Co.), it establishes its power so securely, so firmly, that no change of persons, institutions or parties in the bourgeois-democratic republic can shake it. - Chapter 1 The State: A Product of the Irreconcilability of Class Antagonisms",brightblueson,2025-04-26T16:40:42,1
