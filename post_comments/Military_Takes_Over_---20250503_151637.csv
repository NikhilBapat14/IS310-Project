"Just a reminder, the US border includes 100 miles inland. If nobody keeps batting an eye at this, Trumps plan is absolutely to place troops throughout the entire enforcement zone. In that zone law enforcement basically has martial law type privileges. Nearly 70% of the U.S. population lives in that zone.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-05-04T03:55:58,2

"While I don’t agree with deploying the military to police the borders, your statement is inaccurate. A vast majority of my experience in gwot was presence patrols and policing - as an infantryman.   This also ignores that military police is also an entire military occupational specialty.",Tintagil,2025-05-03T15:36:32,2
To be fare. We are up against tech billionaires and basically all social media and news platforms are promoting maga propaganda. Not to mention the worst scotus of all time.  we didn’t let anything happen we lost slowly until we lost it all,totaly_a_human4,2025-05-03T22:22:18,1

"Mostly changed military doctrine after Iraq 2 and Afghanistan. Where we stayed in the region for 20 years.  Normal military doctrine would lend it'self to be one of ""Soldiers are trained to kill"", but it's changed to something more of ""World police"" doctrine.  I'm not exactly sure how much hold over is what, and what is where... mostly due to the poor leaders that Trump has installed and what direction it would mean.  But Soldiers really shouldn't be positioned to act in civilian matters.  It's one thing to do in a foreign country, another in our own.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-03T15:44:14,1
"If… if! If! We’re so utterly stupid as to believe the lies and misinformation, then we don’t deserve exist as a species in the universe.  Trump has over 5000 large lies attached to him. He’s a rapist. He’s a criminal felon convicted on and of fraud. He’s bankrupted every company he’s owned.  We let this happen. We are to blame. We’re the ones wholeheartedly did this to ourselves.  No excuses.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-04T02:29:04,2
"Yup, especially people who shilled for Biden committing genocide in Gaza and calling him shipping weapons to drop on civilians ""saving lives"" and creating leverage when in reality he never ever tried to save lives. Y'all brought this upon us.",Happy_Confusion_5501,2025-05-04T23:59:47,1
"?’s.  Shilled for Biden committing genocide? I’m confused. At what point in time did Biden order the US armed forces into committing a genocide in Gaza? I’m sure you’ve got that information. Right?  We sold weapons to people who use weapons. Many are the reasons, but the most important reason is leverage and control. Without the US selling those weapons to Israel, things would’ve been tens time worse.  Israel just buys them from China, Iran, Russia, North Korea, anyplace really.   Joe Biden selling Israel weapons saved tens of thousand of lives. Easily. Thank the gods he was President during that time or all of Palestines would’ve been deleted from the Earth and Israel would just own it all.  Still might happen with Trump.  He tried several different ways to save lives. Including diplomacy, economic pressure, direct attempts for aid and several other measures to save lives. Extremely proud of him.  No, we brought this upon ourselves. There’s no excuses. None. No blah, blah, blah, this or that. Nothing.  Trump is a million times worse than anything the democrats have.   Don’t use Gaza as a cheap ploy to avoid personal responsibility.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-05T02:24:48,1
