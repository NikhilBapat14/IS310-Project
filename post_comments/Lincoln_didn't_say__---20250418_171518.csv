"No chance that, nor the referenced EO, were written by Trump. That reeks of Project 2025 and Russell Vought, current head of OMB. Vought is a Christian Nationalist (aka fascist). Please start naming and shining light on these deeply evil, un-American traitors who have infiltrated our government, are driving these narratives, and are destroying our democracy; and who are  hiding in plain sight (Vought, Thiel, Yarvin, Vance, Miller, etc) while we all focus on their main distraction, Trump.  Link to wiki on Vought: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Vought  From the wiki: ""A self-described Christian nationalist, Vought is the founder of the Center for Renewing America,[1] an organization that opposes critical race theory[2] and advocates for the idea of America as a ""nation under God"".[1] He has also played a significant role in Project 2025, an initiative led by the Heritage Foundation that aims to advance conservative policies and reshape the federal government.[3] In May 2024, he was appointed Policy Director of the Republican National Committee's platform committee.""",jaxiepie7,2025-04-18T18:33:44,16
"He’s trying so hard to bring back the patronage system which the Hatch Act forbids, and is what the civil service system is supposed to prevent.  But he’s the dumbest thing to ever set foot in the white house and that includes the animals.",North_Rhubarb594,2025-04-18T18:46:01,15
“Held to the highest standards of conduct and performance.”  In other words the complete opposite of the president.,GoingNutCracken,2025-04-18T19:02:48,11

">Following my Day One Executive Order, the Office of Personnel Management will be issuing new Civil Service Regulations for career government employees. Moving forward, career government employees, working on policy matters, will be classified as “Schedule Policy/Career,” and will be held to the highest standards of conduct and performance. If these government workers refuse to advance the policy interests of the President, or are engaging in corrupt behavior, they should no longer have a job. This is common sense, and will allow the federal government to finally be “run like a business.” We must root out corruption and implement accountability in our Federal Workforce!    trump on [truth social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114360632714487285)",ms_directed,2025-04-18T17:16:19,7
"I mean, Lincoln did stretch the powers of the Executive Branch. There were songs in the south calling Lincoln a tyrant and describing the american flag as a symbol for tyranny. But his stretching of the powers was to end slavery, a very humanist goal. Whereas who knows what Trump wants aside from power and the public's admiration",Kilgoretrout321,2025-04-18T19:41:11,7

"Isn’t King Donnie technically a federal employee?  Because he certainly isn’t performing at the highest standards of conduct and performance. Everything he’s done so far has been an abysmal failure. If Trump were the head of a professional company, the stockholders/ shareholders would’ve fired him for incompetence. Because the president should be following the guidelines (the Constitution ) of the company (the United States).   We all know Trump does not have the best interest of the country at heart. Trump is pushing his own personal agenda. He’s not working for the welfare of the country. You don’t run off to play golf stealing more money from the company/country placing it further in debt. The biggest corruption in this country is Trump using his position in the oval office for the personal gain of himself, his followers( Marjorie Taylor, Greene etc.) and his rich friends.   HE’S PEDDLING HIS MERCHANDISE DURING PRESS CONFERENCES IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND ON AIR FORCE ONE!     King Donnie, the Royal Dick should be voted off the island!
