"I have a republican leaning friend whom I believe is just ignorant. He moved states and while they adjusted to the move he complained at the strict childcare, food, and medical services offered. Despite the fact that they were better in the state they moved to than the state they left.  This sparked an argument between us where I explained, this wouldn’t be a problem if we had universal healthcare. That it would in fact, be cheaper over all and we could spend the excess in better medical and ways to encourage people to become nurses and doctors through pay/education.  He vehemently disagreed until I literally showed him the math through multiple sources. With different examples. He did typical arguments about “I don’t wanna pay for someone else’s care.” Or “but I already pay for good medical.” To which I responded “But you also pay for ridiculously paid CEOs, marketing, etc. the only difference would be that you’d save money and never have to worry about medical bills if god forbid, anything happening to him, his wife, or his children.”  We ended with him agreeing that maybe it wouldn’t be so bad. I don’t think he’s a bad person, but he’s incredibly uneducated and ignorant. I think I’m the only person in his life who has these kinds of conversations with him. His family and other friends just regurgitate these nonsensical arguments. But I don’t mind, he’s my friend and I’m aware that he’s capable of making better decisions, he just doesn’t know any better and he’s constantly surrounded by all these other people.  Last we’ve talked, he’s still unsure about voting for a politician on the left, but he’s willing to vote over measures that promote healthcare. So there’s been some growth.",davidoftheyear,2025-04-30T14:21:17,18

If you scale up the cost of the National Health Service in England and Wales to the size of the US population it would cost a few hundred billion less than the taxpayer spends on Medicaid and Medicare. It would also save the $2.5 trillion that individuals pay to the private health industry. There is no way that you will be allowed to have universal healthcare.

Their system is still mostly privatized, however, it’s illegal to operate essential medical services on a for profit basis there. Elective procedures, i.e like a nose job, tummy tuck, etc can still be run on a for profit basis along with supplemental perks for essential services, i.e a bigger and more private hospital room, more state of the art amenities, etc.   I feel like that would make for a much smoother transition than just completely switching to a single payer model.",anythingfordopamine,2025-04-30T15:59:46,1
