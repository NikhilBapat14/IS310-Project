">Donald Trump has just sent Republicans in Congress a budget proposal that cuts nearly everything, and if they don’t like it, he says he’ll withhold cash that they approve, setting up a constitutional crisis.  Oh great, our 20th constitutional crisis in 100 days. Just throw it on the pile at this point.  I know they won’t, but congress needs to grow a fucking spine. Between these insane budget cuts, DOGE breaking everything, Trumpcession, tourism spiraling, mass deportations, and this stupid as fuck trade war that will result in empty shelves this place will be a wasteland. It’s so puzzling to me how they are tolerating this. Is it fear? Incompetence? Just being evil? Combo of all 3? Honestly so baffling.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-05-02T14:46:32,339
"This is the handiwork of Russell Vought, the Director of the US Office of Management and Budget. He is one of the top masterminds of Project 2025 and has openly and repeatedly stated his preference for the country to become a Christian theocracy.
