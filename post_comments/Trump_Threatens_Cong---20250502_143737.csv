">Donald Trump has just sent Republicans in Congress a budget proposal that cuts nearly everything, and if they don‚Äôt like it, he says he‚Äôll withhold cash that they approve, setting up a constitutional crisis.  Oh great, our 20th constitutional crisis in 100 days. Just throw it on the pile at this point.  I know they won‚Äôt, but congress needs to grow a fucking spine. Between these insane budget cuts, DOGE breaking everything, Trumpcession, tourism spiraling, mass deportations, and this stupid as fuck trade war that will result in empty shelves this place will be a wasteland. It‚Äôs so puzzling to me how they are tolerating this. Is it fear? Incompetence? Just being evil? Combo of all 3? Honestly so baffling.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-05-02T14:46:32,339
