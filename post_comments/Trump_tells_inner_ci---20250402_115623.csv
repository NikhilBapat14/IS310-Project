Iâ€™ll believe it when I see it. Trump is good at telling people what they want to to hear and then doing the opposite,Ok_Sky7827,2025-04-02T12:07:57,88

"Don't believe him.  Musk funded his campaign and is probably propping up all his businesses.  Musk owns the United States Government right now, especially since Congress is a clown show and the Supreme Court, DOJ, and Alphabet agencies are meth labs that are high on their own supply.",Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-04-02T12:44:46,21

"Believe it when I see it. That said, if Iâ€™m Elon and I sense at all that Trumpâ€™s about to fire me Iâ€™m very quickly kissing his ass and telling him I need to go back to working on my businesses and he definitely doesnâ€™t need me anyway because heâ€™s such a genius and Iâ€™m probably just getting in the way.  Because he has 100% torched bridges with his natural costumer base and if he ends up being thrown under the bus by Trump his support from the incel army will disappear too and then where is he left? However if he ends things with Trump amicably he probably keeps that support and heâ€™s still got a lifeline. If he gets in a fight with Trump heâ€™s alone on an island and may be at real risk of ruin. Liberals are looking at other EVs and left Twitter when it was still Twitter. If the Red Pilled leave X for Truth Social and continue to still not consider an EV heâ€™s fairly fucked.",TheIgnitor,2025-04-02T14:23:11,1

Democrats should leave Elon Musk alone. He's good to remain in Trump's administration. It'll be a good political weapon against the Republicans in next years midterms. Democrats should constantly hammer over and over again about the economy.,Electrical_Rip9520,2025-04-02T17:55:02,1
"The article states that some of Trump's cabinet are grateful that musk has acted as a ""heat shield"", and ""took bullets"" for Trump.
