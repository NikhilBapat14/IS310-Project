"I do understand your point, but weren't people deported to the death camps during WWII? Honestly when I see the word deportation I immediately think about Auschwitz. So it's not like it's an amazingly positive word either  Afterthought: actually I'm just realising this may be due to my own personal background, as the word deportation is less general and neutral in my native language. So it may be fun for you to learn that the French may think about Auschwitz when reading headlines in English about the US ATM  After-afterthought: maybe fun wasn't the right word there",Acrobatic-Stoat,2025-04-29T20:43:56,2
