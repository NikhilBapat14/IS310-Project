Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst is up for re-election in 2026. There are two swing House seats in Iowa ‚Äì one won by the Republican with just 0.19% of the vote.   Now is the time to start working for a Democratic House and Senate. Waiting until two months before the election just doesn't cut it in the MAGA era. In person precinct work trumps broligarch social media and cable.   Iowa is not as fundamentally red as some people assume. Obama carried the state in 2012 with 51.99% of the vote. Better candidates and better organization make a difference.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-30T19:06:09,49

Trump is in a race against time to wipe out democracy before democracy removes him.  He‚Äôs the reason Canada is now swinging to the left and their right wing party is on the outs.,muffledvoice,2025-04-30T22:15:19,6

"To remove the President, impeachment hearings have to begin. Speaker Johnson won‚Äôt do this. He isn‚Äôt up for reelection until 2026.   But let‚Äôs say somehow he loses the Speakership and his successor chooses to do the hearings. Impeachment requires 228 votes. Democrats hold 213 but just lost two to unexpected deaths so 211.   But let‚Äôs say they could sway 7 republicans to impeach. Then it would go to the senate for conviction which requires 67 votes. Democrats hold 45.   It‚Äôs not happening.",userlivewire,2025-04-30T23:36:42,2
I‚Äôll lay odds 3-1. If American voters flip both the house and senate. The current administration will not recognize the election.,trastamara22,2025-05-02T07:03:59,1

"Republicans have a slim majority and they know it too, which is why all the DOGE cuts and EO‚Äôs have been rushed and not through proper legal channels. They are afraid and I can‚Äôt wait to kick them out of office!",Ready-Ad6113,2025-04-30T19:32:40,29
"I know she was ridiculed after this but the pollster that released the Iowa general election poll before Nov 2024 did show a big swing towards the democrats because of older females in the electorate. I know Harris didn‚Äôt end up winning the state but truly, those numbers don‚Äôt come from thin air. I believe there had to have been some truth to it, some trend that was picked up but ultimately didn‚Äôt push it our way. I think Iowa could be a legit pick up for dems.",sr41489,2025-04-30T19:56:33,9

"And we as members of the party have to demand that non stop. Impeach the orange tyrant, impeach his corrupt, incompetent goons, block everything he tries to do, constantly try to strip his power. Obstruction might not be progress, but it can stop regress.",Grace_of_Talamh,2025-05-01T03:05:21,1
The courts are gumming up the works enough that we should be able to make it to midterms. It's up to those who screwed the pooch and voted for this madman or didn't vote at all to actually show up and make the right choices.,Amenian,2025-04-30T19:28:09,30

"I hadn't even thought about it that way, but that's likely why a ""special department"" was just suddenly created out of thin air. They really did run through all of the right wing's most hated departments and chainsaw them into oblivion because they KNEW that those cuts would have never passed otherwise. That and it also served a purpose in helping Elon destroy the departments that had been investigating his companies. A little quid pro quo at the expense of American citiizens.",LivingIndependence,2025-04-30T23:40:27,3

"The house could vote to impeach, but without 67 vot w in the Senate to convict it would end the same as the last two attempts.    That's not to say it shouldn't happen, but let's keep our expectations realistic.",NimusNix,2025-05-01T04:47:28,5
"I feel you on that, but I feel less aggravation about it because I don't see Democrats as a singular force but rather a coalition.  That coalition could probably get some good legislation out of the house with a big enough swing, the Senate is geographically fucked for the foreseeable future.     It's just what it is.",NimusNix,2025-04-30T20:05:36,13
