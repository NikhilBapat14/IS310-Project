"*From Bloomberg News reporter Dylan Sloan and Michael Smith:*  Not far from Ellis Island, “Golden Door” for 12 million immigrants, things are looking up for a growth opportunity in today’s America: deportation.  Just west of the historic landmark in New York Harbor, the nation’s largest for-profit prison company, GEO Group Inc., is reopening a controversial outpost. The 1,000-bed detention center in Newark, New Jersey, is set to become a forced stopover – a modern-day Ellis Island in reverse – for some of the millions of immigrants the Trump administration has vowed to deport.  Immigrants are good business for the US prison-industrial complex these days. Profits are poised to rise in the coming years. Stock prices are skyrocketing. And so is the wealth of executives who’ve lobbied hard for this moment.  Few are profiting more than George Zoley, the Greek-born founder of GEO Group. His personal fortune has grown by $50 million since Donald Trump was reelected in November promising the largest mass deportations in US history. As GEO Group stock soared, Zoley’s wealth reached a new milestone: $304 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

The fact that someone can even become that wealthy from being involved in the prison system is sickening. The for-profit prison system is cancerous. Incentivizing human suffering.,jster1311,2025-05-09T14:32:52,2

"They're reopening their Leavenworth facility, which was notorious for being a hell hole, and was the subject of much scrutiny and legal action. Ironically, a good deal of the Federal heat came during the first Trump administration, because he hadn't yet gutted and politicized every Department, Bureau, and Agency. Note that the facility was closed down because the Biden administration didn't renew the contract, not because it was unfit for purpose. The chances that CoreCivic will make sure all the cameras work and cell doors lock this time is slim to none.   https://www.aclukansas.org/en/publications/we-cannot-trust-corecivic-keep-anyone-safe-leavenworth-or-anywhere-else",coldfarm,2025-05-09T15:13:36,3
