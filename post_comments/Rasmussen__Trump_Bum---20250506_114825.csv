"‚ÄúDaily tracking results are collected through telephone surveys of 300 likely voters a night and reported on a five-day rolling average. To reach those who have abandoned landline telephones, Rasmussen Reports said it uses an online survey tool to interview randomly selected participants from a demographically diverse panel. The margin error for the full sample of 1,500 likely voters is plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.‚Äù  What is selection basis, Alex",yuanshaosvassal,2025-05-06T12:05:19,11
50 percent coming from Rasmussen of all pollers is not good for Trump or the Republicans considering how tilted to the Right they always are.,katyadc,2025-05-06T11:51:48,8

"The second he threatened pollsters who reported low ratings for him, he rendered all future positive polls irrelevant and untrustworthy. It is safer to assume increasingly universal disapproval until the authoritarian is gone.   He made his bed.",vucubcame,2025-05-06T12:33:03,5

Try polling in Emporia VA. where the Boars head factory shut down a few weeks ago and now Georgia Pacific just announced it's shutting down too. Let's see what their polling numbers are.,Hungry-External-7812,2025-05-06T13:50:20,2

"Ugh, the last time this polling technique would get an accurate sample (we don't know where the callers were located either nor how their numbers were on Rasmussen's call list) was in the nineties.
