"> “I guess he wants to make a deal. Everybody does,” said the U.S. president.    This is what he means when he says that everybody is kissing his ass and that he runs the world.    Tariffs aren't trade policy.  They're extortion.  The requirement is that every world leader and CEO must come to Trump and make a deal with him.",Searchlights,2025-05-05T14:24:26,17

I have a faint hope that Carney might be able to pursuade Trump that he is a wise man that Trump can look up to for sage advice behind the scenes and Carney can guide him back to economic realism and democracy.  Faint hope.,ThrwawayCusBanned,2025-05-05T15:38:22,1

I don’t get why Carney is even going.    DT isn’t going to listen to anything an economist like Carney says as he’s publicly said he thinks he’s smarter than Jerome Powell over at the FED.,Deicide1031,2025-05-05T14:16:45,15

I just hope Carney get up and leaves on live tv if Trump brings up the 51st state,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-05T14:24:52,16
Trump agrees with the last person he talks with. Carney probably has a few objectives that he'll talk trump into announcing publicly.    Carney previously took the approach that he understands what trump is trying to achieve. Thus he can 'help' trump achieve them.   Right now trump needs a trade 'deal' with somebody. ,uniklyqualifd,2025-05-05T14:44:02,3
"I hope Carney is smart enough to observe that arguing the economics or logic of anything isn’t Trump’s language. And I don’t want him contributing to Trump’s corruption fund with my tax money. Therefore, Trump exists only to be manipulated through flattery and exploitation of ignorance. ",clickmagnet,2025-05-05T14:27:21,2
Powell is a lawyer. Carney has a PhD in economics from Oxford and spent 13 years at Goldman Sachs. It is quite possible that DT thinks Carney is smarter than Powell.,jtbc,2025-05-05T15:29:42,2
No one is gonna make a deal with a madman. All countries are letting the 90 day pause play out while the consequences start hitting Americans and Trump loses any leverage he might of had.   Stupidity played itself,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-05-05T19:41:38,2

That’s right. You all stand firm with your middle fingers held high. Honestly the population up there should encourage him not to go. It’s a waste of time and he’s also just going to disrespect you during the whole thing.,powderedmilf,2025-05-05T15:06:20,3
Completely agree. I think the point a lot of us are making here in the US is that it's hilarious he even has this idea in his dementia brain. R's would literally never win a presidency again if it did actually happen. So why is he so obsessed with it?   Dementia and stupidity.,5th_degree_burns,2025-05-05T18:56:05,2
Exactly...the u.s doesn't actually want Canada to be the 51st state...that would be like California or Maine on steroids...,seekertrudy,2025-05-06T08:52:37,1
I'm just saying what a fool Trump would be to want this. He already has 2 of the largest states that consistently vote Democrat. Would adding Canada which is the size of California and therefore would garner the same amount of electoral votes be in the Republican's interest? They would not be able to win another election because the votes of the small Red states would not matter anymore.,Suspicious-Team-6774,2025-05-05T16:14:53,1
"While I agree with you that Carney should make Trump wait 5 hours, then let him know that the meeting is off; think of the optics of Trump not getting any kind of a ""deal"" or understanding at all, from Carney.  They are becoming rabid, like caged animals, trying desperately to have some kind of progress to show the MSM and American electorate.    And, God help Trump and Vance if they try the Oval Office strong-arm show like they did with Zelensky.  There is no one more qualified to spout economics that would make both their heads spin.",Postom,2025-05-05T15:33:17,3

My guess is Canada wouldn’t be made a state.  It would be turned into a US territory and therefore would have no right to vote in US elections. ,Good_Tomato_4293,2025-05-05T19:46:10,1

Or.. Carney could explain the fallacy of the logic behind the desire to annex Canada. Look I know this is all ridiculous. But this isn't the only thing that Trump desires that is actually contrary to his interests. This guy is not playing chess.. he couldn't even handle tic-tac-toe.,Suspicious-Team-6774,2025-05-05T16:34:50,1
