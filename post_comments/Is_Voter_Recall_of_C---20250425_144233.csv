">Some states allow recall of certain elected officials, including those elected to Congress  Some states claim that they have the right to recall Congressional members, but it is likely unconstitutional, as your link explains.",reasonably_plausible,2025-04-25T20:51:17,42
"Not really. This isn't really a structural problem. The Reps are actually doing exactly what they said they would do. The GOP has clearly been in subservience to Trump for a while now, so anyone who expected his own party to reel him in was just someone who wasn't making quality political decisions to begin with.  Congress is doing what it was elected to do--enable and empower Trump's agenda. Recalling only works if Congress is doing the opposite of what voters elected them to do, and that doesn't apply in this case.",mormagils,2025-04-26T09:27:51,10
"Some interesting points have been raised here. I wonder if a ""recall"" attempt would necessarily be futile even if there is no constitutional path. (Is that true? Isn't this the purview of a state's constitution?)   Circulating a recall petition to the voters in a congressional district would definitely get the attention of the representative in a visceral way, especially if you can get a large number of signatures.",Odd_Book8314,2025-04-26T10:38:27,4
"Even if it were legal, it’s not a viable solution due to the cognitive dissonance that goes on regarding Congressional performance—*Congress* sucks, but *my* Representative/Senator is good at their job and therefore needs to stay.",DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-25T22:05:48,17
"Unfortunately it hasn't really been tested. You'd think they states would reserve the right to recall elected federal officials for [high crimes and missemeanors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_crimes_and_misdemeanors).  > Since 1386, the English Parliament had used the term ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" to describe one of the grounds to impeach officials of the crown. Officials accused of ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" were accused of offenses as varied as misappropriating government funds, appointing unfit subordinates, not prosecuting cases, promoting themselves ahead of more deserving candidates, threatening a grand jury, disobeying an order from Parliament, arresting a man to keep him from running for Parliament, helping ""suppress petitions to the King to call a Parliament,"" etc.  ""High"" in the historic context related to the office, so a ""high crime"" was understood to be something akin to ""abuse of power"" which might not actually be a violation of any specific criminal law. As seen in the paragraph from the Wikipedia article, something like ""appointing unfit subordinates"" might be in play and you'd expect also any sort of ignoring court orders. So when top doj officials ignore court orders, the AG should be impeached for appointing unfit subordinates, and I'd argue any senator who voted to confirm is probably a good candidate as well.",cballowe,2025-04-25T20:58:04,7
"Recall is possible in some states and localities.  But members of Congress cannot be recalled.   Per Article I Section 5, House members and senators can be expelled with a two-thirds vote by members of their respective chambers.  There is nothing in the constitution that allows for recall and their fate is determined by elections that are held at fixed intervals (two years for the House, six years for the Senate.)",I405CA,2025-04-25T23:58:27,4

They are elected every two years just vote them out. The time it takes to get a recall and fund it it’s election time again. I don’t believe i recalls. There is no buyers remorse. Do your research and find out who they are and then vote them out.   Commit crimes they get impeached. But if they aren’t governing they way you thought you’re the asshat for not knowing who they were. Just support a challenger and work to get them the fck out,hereiswhatisay,2025-05-01T20:23:33,1
Or you could spend your time and effort identifying someone who lives in the district and reflects enough of the views of the district members to be a viable candidate for the House.  You could say give this person money and volunteer to be on their staff and (I don't know) run against the person you want to recall.  This will have two likely outcomes.  The person will see a viable challenger who is not MAGA and publicly repudiates it and starts to fight it.  The preson doubles down and may get defeated and your new sane person goes to the House instead.,Sapriste,2025-04-26T10:30:10,0

"It's a good question.  On some level, because there's no teeth behind it, I wonder if the thought process would be: ""I won my election with 52% of the vote.  Therefore, if even 48% of the electorate signed this fake recall petition, that's also who didn't vote for me in the first place, so it's a meaningless petition.""  (And honestly I can't say they're wrong, people will react differently to a symbolic petition than an actual vote.)",digbyforever,2025-04-27T08:54:50,1
This is not an example of cognitive dissonance. But yes that is the correct reason that it wouldn't work. It's well documented that the overall anger at congress stops at ones actual representative.,zuriel45,2025-04-26T12:37:00,12
> and I'd argue any senator who voted to confirm is probably a good candidate as well.    Senators and representatives are not subject to impeachment per the Blount impeachment trial because they aren’t civil officers of the United States. There’s also the matter that each House can expel members thereof on it’s own authority via the same 2/3 margin needed for an impeachment conviction without any involvement of the other House.,DanforthWhitcomb_,2025-04-25T22:10:07,10
"> Per Article I Section 5, House members and senators can be expelled with a two-thirds vote by members of their respective chambers.

"Yes. That is largely how the Constitution has been interpreted. That you *can't* put any additional requirements on holding office, except what the constitution provides.",reasonably_plausible,2025-04-26T22:38:37,10
"It might help you to understand that when the Constitution outlays a process for a thing, it's often implicit that things that are not discussed are not part of the process. Consider the role of Supreme Court Justice: nowhere in the Constitution does it directly say they serve for life. Rather, only one process is provided for their removal.  Appointment of congress people and senators is going to be like this. The process described is how they are appointed, censured and removed by congress, and so forth. If it is silent on the States removing them, well, since the process was not given, it does not exist.",Ashmedai,2025-04-30T10:30:16,2
Meanwhile those that you didn't vote for but still get in become the source of all of your problems and thus need to be removed immediately.    A constant recall option becomes a 24/7 election if the criteria is if 50% agree and near useless if it's much higher.,According_Ad540,2025-04-26T19:47:59,5
The 10th reserves powers not specifically delegated to the federal government by the Constitution to the states.  The power to remove congressmen **is already delegated** to the federal government in Article 1 section 5. Therefore it is not a power the states have.,BrainDamage2029,2025-04-26T23:07:18,3

"I replied in the other response I got that I don't like those arguments because   >there are two versions which are ""well it doesn't say no, so we can do it"" OR ""well it doesn't say yes, so we can't do it."" And, those are applied by insincere people which ever way is most convenient.   >If we accept that argument, then the conservatives can get away with throwing out many laws (and associated institutions) because they aren't explicitly stated in the constitution. As an example, nothing in the constitution says ""Its cool for OSHA to regulate workplace safety"" and that's the foundation for the argument for getting rid of OSHA. But the same people turn around and say ""Nothing in the constitution says we can't force people to work 20 hour days 365 days a year, so we should be able to do that.""  The real big example, to my mind, is Marbury v Madison. The constitution does not specifically say that the supreme court has judicial review, it doesn't say ""the supreme court decides if laws are constitutional."" It's silent on that, so we should assume its not there right?  Beyond that, on the specific issue of recall elections. I don't see why congress or a state couldn't make a law that allows recall elections of their congresspeople. And certainly, worst case scenario, recall elections could be added explicitly via amendment.",GrayEidolon,2025-04-30T23:52:04,1

"> The real big example, to my mind, is Marbury v Madison.  It's a poor example and an oft-repeated specious claim. Marbury v Madison was just a judicial codification of what was commonly understood of the Constitution at the time. The Constitution states in Article III, Section 2, paragraph 1 that:      the judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law     and Equity, arising under this Constitution  To argue that it means something else would be to argue that we weren't supposed to have a Constitutional system of Government at all. That would be a little strange, and I can't take this seriously at all. Sorry.",Ashmedai,2025-05-01T06:16:05,2
"I think someone with legal authority could easily argue from  > Article 1 section 4: The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.  and   >1, 5 Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.  That a recall election is perfectly valid under the constitution as is.   But obviously, the worst case scenario here, is amending the constitution to explicitly use the words ""recall elections are allowed.""  *****  I actually dislike the argument that because specific modern tight phrases don't exist in the constitution, that the embodied concept simply can't be conveyed by the constitution. I think it is an insincere argument, because it can be used equally in two different ways, to get the outcome of whoever is using it.   Those two versions are ""well it doesn't say no, so we can do it"" OR ""well it doesn't say yes, so we can't do it."" And as I just said, those are applied by insincere people which ever way is most convenient.   If we accept that argument, then the conservatives can get away with throwing out so many laws (and associated institutions) because they aren't explicitly stated in the constitution. As an example, nothing in the constitution says ""Its cool for OSHA to regulate workplace safety"" and that's the foundation for the argument for getting rid of OSHA. But the same people turn around and say ""Nothing in the constitution says we can't force people to work 20 hour days 365 days a year, so we should be able to do that.""  And so I find the specific text argument to be a ""whatever gets me my outcome"" kind of argument. And it ignores that congress makes laws and the constitution is obviously meant to be permissive. Congress could easily make a law, or a state could easily make a law, that says, like, 'If the electorate becomes unsatisfied with the congress person who represents them, they shall, by prescribed process, have the right to an election that removes them from their office and replaces them with a new congress person who shall finish the term and be considered to have served the whole term.' or some shit like that.",GrayEidolon,2025-04-27T12:10:55,2
"Okay, I'll cede that. I don't think removing that example changes my overall point.",GrayEidolon,2025-05-01T12:08:25,2
"Well, part of your point is that we could have an Amendment, and of course we could. Whether Congress could make a law or the States could is debatable, though, with some reasonable doubt. The Constitution grants them some flexibility in going about how they elect but says nothing about how the States can remove. Granted, there are some vague bits, but that doesn't lead to any kind of home run, particularly given what I said about the general sentiment that ""if the process is listed, that's the process.""  p.s., I am not fighting you on the idea that recall elections are good. I sort of wish we could be like some countries where if they can't pass a budget, they all get recalled and have to rerun.",Ashmedai,2025-05-01T12:18:22,1
