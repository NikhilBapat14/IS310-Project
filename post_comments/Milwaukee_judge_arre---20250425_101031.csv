"FBI Director Kash Patel said Friday that the bureau had arrested a Milwaukee judge and charged her with obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week — the first known instance of the Justice Department prosecuting a local official for allegedly interfering with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement.  Patel announced the arrest of Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan in a post on the social media platform X. He accused Dugan of “intentionally misdirecting” federal agents who arrived at the courthouse to detain an immigrant who was set to appear before her in an unrelated proceeding.  “Thankfully, our agents chased down the perp on foot and he’s been in custody since,” Patel wrote. “But the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.”  Read more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/25/wisconsin-judge-arrest-fbi-ice-immigration-enforcement/?utm\_campaign=wp\_main&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/25/wisconsin-judge-arrest-fbi-ice-immigration-enforcement/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",washingtonpost,2025-04-25T10:11:01,8

"> “Thankfully, our agents chased down the perp on foot and he’s been in custody since,” Patel wrote. “But the Judge’s obstruction created increased danger to the public.”    Why does it sound to me like the ""obstruction"" was that she let him walk out of the courtroom?",Searchlights,2025-04-25T10:20:25,7
