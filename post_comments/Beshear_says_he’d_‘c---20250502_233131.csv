"I think Beshear is the safest bet of any pick and probably who I would want for this situation. I think if you drill it down to who looks moderate enough to win, is charming and has credible experience that would matter to swing state voters, Beshear is the choice.   AOC is great but the electoral environment doesn’t favor her and even if she won a lot of her time would be spent rebuilding the government.   Pritzker COULD be a great pick but it’s a gamble because you know the Right will throw Chicago crime stereotypes at him constantly.",FawningDeer37,2025-05-02T23:43:44,14
"I love that our bench has Buttigieg, Booker, Beshear, AOC, Whitmer, Newsom, Harris, Pritzker, Shapiro, Warnock, Porter (I can dream), Cooper, Shapiro, Stein, Walz, Polis... and the Republicans are talking about Trump for the third term in 2028.",Howdthecatdothat,2025-05-02T23:49:32,12
"At this point literally everyone should be considering it. Beshear, Pritzker, Whitmer, Newsom, Harris, Walz, AOC, Bernie, Hillary, both Obamas, SAS, Tom Hanks, Biden. Trump is going to run again. All bets are off.",Wings81,2025-05-02T23:42:48,7
"Yeah, we do not need to figure this out right now. Can we just not? Can we just let the citizens organically rise up in the streets right now? I promise we’ll find a leader. We don’t need to force it anyways that’s just the way I see it.",SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-03T00:01:03,5

"It keeps us ahead of our Republican opponents to think about it now.

"> Beshear is fighting every day.  My post was not critical of him but the media, but democrats should have a better prepared answer when asked about 2028...pointing out that Trump is systematically destroying what made America unique and a beacon to the world.",Agnos,2025-05-03T08:28:43,1

"If I were either of them I would be on the phone with Bernie asking what specific policies I need to add to my platform to get his endorsement.  Assuming AOC doesn't run, whichever candidate can grab an early endorsement from Bernie will catch fire.",gradientz,2025-05-03T00:10:56,3
"What specifically has Beshear said or done that makes you call him a neoliberal and right-leaning?  Please point to policies, not vibes.",gradientz,2025-05-03T00:24:14,3
"Mark Carney, who just won in Canada, is not particularly exciting. Anthony Albanese, who just won in Australia, is also not exciting.  Competent government is boring - it's boring government officials doing a job they were assigned to do. They are servants of the public, not entertainers.  The American obsession with celebrity and media hype is ridiculous and part of what got us into this mess. I have yet to hear a single argument against Beshear based on policy or his governance style. He's a highly effective, progressive governor that has become popular in a ruby red state the old fashioned way - by showing up when people need him, focusing on policy issues people care about, and trying to materially improve their lives.",gradientz,2025-05-03T10:57:30,2
"I think that list can be trimmed down a lot - all of them can be good campaigning for a candidate, though.",AWall925,2025-05-03T00:14:14,2
"Point to me the policies that suggest he's a strong left of center candidate. And if you think vibes don't matter you're proving my point.  Bernje, AOC, walz, pritzker, and now evers.  That's the floor.  Your ideology is not equipped to handle what is coming because it is the ideology that got us here.",Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-03T00:40:58,-1
"I’m talking about being excited because I’m able to vote for someone I actually align with instead of these centrist ass dems, but go ahead with all your assumptions.",FreddyTwasFingered,2025-05-03T11:30:29,1
"Beshear is extremely pro-union.   For example, he is a strong opponent of right-to-work, backed the UAW in their successful strike against GM and Ford, and supported the teachers union in opposing amendment 2. The AFL-CIO, UAW, IAM, NEA, and SMART all fought very hard for and made public statements celebrating his reelection. Multiple union leaders said that Beshear and Walz were their preferred choices for VP.  Neoliberals, on the other hand, aren't allowed to support unions. That's pretty core to their belief system.  I didn't say vibes don't matter. I asked you why you called him a neoliberal and right-leaning. You didn't answer, and instead decided to speculate about my ideology (I'm a Brooklyn leftist in AOC's neighboring district, by the way).",gradientz,2025-05-03T01:06:56,5
">someone I actually align with  Which is why I pointed out the need to focus on actual policies rather than vibes fed to you by the corporate media.  With this in mind, what specific policy positions does Beshear have that you oppose?   Is it his unrelenting pro-union record or is it his unapologetic support for trans people while governing a red state?",gradientz,2025-05-03T12:01:08,1
Biden is a Neoliberal. He did some pro union stuff.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-03T01:29:42,0
You really need to learn how to have a discussion with people without inserting your assumptions. I don’t care about vibes or the media.  Everything you mentioned should be the base for any dem running for president. Like that’s the bare minimum I’d expect. The only person that I would put money behind right now is AOC.,FreddyTwasFingered,2025-05-03T12:14:42,0
"First of all - Beshear didn't do ""some"" pro-union stuff. He ran as a union candidate and has consistently supported union priorities throughout his career. The UAW president called him the ""top name"" on Kamala's shortlist.  Second, no, neoliberals are not allowed to support unions.  You are not educated on neoliberalism if you have been led to believe otherwise. The [central goal](https://jacobin.com/2022/10/crackdown-labor-repression-neoliberalization-poor-countries-global-south-trade-liberalization) of neoliberalism is to crush worker power. Biden's surprising (though somewhat limited) support for unions during his administration was widely viewed as a significant deviation from the neoliberal tradition, which is precisely why he got so much flak from the corporate media and praise from people like Bernie and AOC when that happened.  Still waiting on you to explain why you think Beshear is a neoliberal and right-leaning. All I have heard so far are vibes and virtue signaling.",gradientz,2025-05-03T01:38:09,5
"I live in AOC's neighboring district and was at her first victory party in 2018.   If she was governor of Kentucky, she would be governing basically the exact same way as Beshear. Maybe she would make better use of social media, but that's it.  The main difference is that AOC's role as a public servant requires her to opine on federal policy. A servant of the public governs for the people they represent and the role to which they are assigned.  This isn't the time to fuck around. The democracy is on the line. Put in the guy who we know for sure can win.",gradientz,2025-05-03T12:20:27,1

"Yes, and explained why. You still haven't explained why you think Beshear is a neoliberal and right-leaning.",gradientz,2025-05-03T08:43:39,1
"Harris never won a competitive election, and started the campaign with negative popularity.  Beshear has a 68% approval in Kentucky. While openly advocating for trans people and progressive economic policy.  Always fun to project  ""everything I personally don't like"" on the loser, but clearly they are not the same.",gradientz,2025-05-03T12:32:58,2
