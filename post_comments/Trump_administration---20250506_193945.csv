"This is even worse than it sounds.  This peripherally has to do with COVID and any other infecious disease in healthcare facilities.  This group makes hugely important decisions about best practice policies for hospitals, rehab center, clinics, nursing homes, dialyis centers, and any other place where healthcare is given.  It is the most learned body to develop and implement practices to counteract the truly dreadful epidemic of multi-drug resistant bacterial and fungal infections that cannot be treated by antibiotics.   Multidrug resistanct organisms can cause debilitating and deadly infections in all sorts of people accessing healthcare:   Newborns in incubators, people with infected joint impants, trauma patients with major surgeries,  diabetics with pneumonias and skin infections, complex patients of all ages in ICUs,  women in delivery areas, sepsis patients, infection outbreaks in nursing homes.   And, they have the ability to collect and analye data to determine where there are risks of disease outbreaks, of improper practices, of how to allocate resources.  I read that CDC had soem warning that something like this was going to happen, and I truly hope they have workarounds in place.  It is absolutely essential that the CDC be able to receive valid epidemiologic data and use scientific analysis in these decisions.   Otherwise, we go back to wearing amulets and making up spells and chants for severe diseases and thinking that taking vitamins will cure sepsis.",Busy-Song407,2025-05-07T00:05:56,7

"InfectiousDiseaseAndLandmines.txt  In the cruel calculus of landmines, it is known that a mine that simply kills a soldier is not as effective as a mine that maims one. That injured soldier will occupy three others who will try to keep him alive and evacuated to a field hospital. That maimed soldier will then use up resources in his treatment and rehabilitation, and will continue to sap a nation's will and morale whenever people look on his ravaged body.  Thus it is with disease. Every child paralyzed with polio also meant a family in continual debt. A mother too exhausted to raise any more children. A brother who will not go to college, as planned, but must instead go straight to employment to help pay the bills. A father and businessman who will not have the energy and will to take the risks needed to expand his business or aspire for a promotion.  In the summer when the polio vaccine was to be distributed for a nationwide trial, the scientists and officials in charge debated whether it was too early to take such a risky step. One of their number pointed out that the nation was expected to have ***30,000*** new cases of polio that summer.  Thirty Thousand! A number that is equivalent to the toll of an invasion by a foreign army! With collateral damage to the families as well!

A little courage.   Someone's got it.  Someone has the testicular fortitude to tell it like it is.   Christ Almighty why do people fear direct conversation?  I see this in companies all the time.... Fucking tell it like it is.   I get well paid as a consultant to tell executives what they need but don't want to hear.   Fuck!,goderdammurang,2025-05-06T21:24:58,9
"They could speak up!  They could get on the news. Each states senator can do a free speech in a public park. They can write op-Ed‚Äôs. That can go on podcasts. That‚Äôs 5 things I thought of in 30 seconds. These supposed great minds are suddenly, deaf, dumb and mute and it‚Äôs beyond disheartening. It‚Äôs a traitorous betrayal.",joni-draws,2025-05-06T23:16:47,-1

Scary/stupid true observation. Good leaders invite criticism. Bad ones weed out those who would dare critique their master plan.   I‚Äôve watched 4 C-suite execs crash and burn at my company cuz they didn‚Äôt want to hear what I or other ‚Äúunderlings‚Äù had to say.   Many (most?) powerful people are crazy dissociated from reality.,MqAbillion,2025-05-07T00:04:11,4

"Here‚Äôs the thing. They were already right wing. You can have an entire lineup of liberal commentators and still have a conservative bias by time and again favoring corporations over the public and normalizing radical conservative takes.   You accomplish this by focusing on socially liberal topics, or sensationalist topics while you accomplish 3 things just behind the scenes.   1. Normalize radical conservative talking points by bringing ‚Äúexperts from both sides‚Äù to explain what DT could have meant if we put him in the best light.  2. Completely silence anti-corporate talking points. Inequality? Ignore it. Minimum wage? Both sides it into oblivion. Unions? Talk about the damage they‚Äôre causing to the community.   3. Focus on sensationalist topics while ignoring more pressing ones. Example: Allowing Trump to dominate the news cycle with his latest offensive AI picture instead of covering how social media companies are fueling a teen suicide crisis or how opioid & oil companies similarly withheld or actively silenced reports about the dangers of their products years after realizing the risk internally.  This doesn‚Äôt just happen domestically either. For decades, the US government has very likely funneled money to outlets like Al Jazeera through 3rd parties like Qatar [in exchange pulling punches in their reporting](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/oct/27/us-asks-qatar-to-turn-down-the-volume-of-al-jazeera-news-coverage) or [ignoring certain topics](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/apr/28/iraq.iraqandthemedia) & promoting centrists wherever possible. They accomplished this while many listeners were convinced Al Jazeera was in opposition to the US‚Äô actions in the Middle East.  This isn‚Äôt to say CNN or Al Jazeera are incapable of reporting without bias. It‚Äôs just that often they‚Äôre not incentivized to, and their real bias is in what they don‚Äôt report on.",vonnecute,2025-05-06T22:23:02,2
