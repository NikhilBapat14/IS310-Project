"Scare any opposition from trying to run against Putin.  Let them know they will get poisoned, or assassinated or thrown in jail indefinitely.   The citizens know very well that you don't speak out about Putin ever, no matter their inner feelings.",clintCamp,2025-03-17T08:59:33,17
"Russians are cowards. Being even-handed, Americans are cowards, too. The big difference is that it's been like this in Russia for 100 years. It's only been like this for a few years here. But we have/had farther to fall.",wereallbozos,2025-03-20T16:45:02,2
"...  Slightly more than 100 years ago Russia overthrew their monarchs, murdered them, then had a massive civil war, and completely restructured their society into a system that had never been tried before, anywhere.   Less then 20 years later they faced down arguably the most powerful army assembled up to that point that was literally hell bent on exterminating most of them and enslaving the rest, and turned the tide of WW2 a cost of lives simply unfathomable in the among the other allies.. Then they had another revolution, significantly changing their government again for the second time in a century.  I'm not saying all the moves were the best advised, but they seem like some of the least cowardly people around.",Waterwoo,2025-03-20T20:58:25,2
