"The French, in the 30's, had a serious problem with a slow rolling fascist takeover of their country. Not the German's invading, as that wasn't until 1940, but an internal rot that was gaining power, with France being considered, by almost every country at that point, all but fallen to the authoritarian right-wing ideology that had toppled many of its formerly democratic neighbors, because they had seen the exact same thing play out over and over, always ending in the death of a democracy. Then the left-wing parties reversed the encroachment of the right by getting together and deciding who was more ideologically pure. No, obviously that would cause them to lose. What they did is they got together and decided on the bare acceptable common needs of each group, which were more or less just wresting control back and focusing on fixing the weaknesses that let some elected stooges grab so much power and violate so many norms. In the end, it worked and the re-righted the ship, although then Germany invaded, but still. It worked. Unlike anything the US left has been doing.  I mean, maybe you guys could try something like that after Hogg primaries many of the current democratic candidates or firebombs some DNC offices or whatever acts of unification we're looking forward to. We have plenty of time to work out internal squabbles. The right isn't consolidating power or pushing against fraying restraints or anything, so no need to rush anything.

"The voting record thing is meaningless, its just a record of who votes with Democrat proposed bills more or less... so something like continuing the AUMF for the war on terror or expanding military funding counts if a Democratic Senate proposes it, even if its not at all progressive.   Build Back Better only reaches that threshold by presenting tax breaks for things like solar panels on oil rigs as ""social spending."" Its also over 10 years so... its extremely exaggerated.

💯but the issue is America isn’t going to vote him in as president I do think he would be perfect for the job but for the win we are going to need a straight white man. I think Bernie(yes I know he’s old) with a VP of AoC of Pete would win the ticket. If not they can do a third party let the old Dems and Republican Party die of fill it with those that oppose trumps bs. Now this is just a dream of mine not a reality.

"The Democrats are, by pretty much any metric, a shitty, useless party. They don’t protect civil liberties. They don’t stand with marginalized people. They don’t end the forever wars. They take money from AIPAC and Big Oil and insurance companies. They don’t even really use their power when they have it, as evidenced by the fact that we just had four years of Biden and Trump is more ascendant than ever. The only, and I do mean the only, reason to vote a Democrat into power is to keep a Republican out of the seat, and with each passing year the parties become more indistinguishable. A fucking Dem AG just sent the fascist FBI after pro-Palestinian protestors, and I’m supposed to believe that these are the freedom fighters standing against authoritarianism?  We’re constantly told that we can have “better” just as soon as we get through this next election cycle, and it never fucking happens. Biden ran on being a one-term president and reneged on that promise pretty much immediately. I’m tired of waiting.

"> there is a left  Is there? If so, they seem more committed to avoiding the ballot box and avoiding running for office. While they're busy waiting for the perfect candidate to arrive and to be catered to, they already handed over democratic power by letting conservatives vote & elect politicians on their behalf.  Political parties are defined by the people who show up. This isn't a chicken-or-egg dilemma. if you want a party to be more progressive, the voters need to actually participate first.

"A strong 3rd part is exactly what we need. Our founding fathers explicitly and repeatedly warned against a bicameral system. And we are now experiencing why they warned against it.   It has created an ""us vs them"" mindset that has wholly divided the country, and virtually destroyed any hope of constructive discourse. Because it's ""us vs them"", all of Congress is expected to vote for whatever bills their party present and vote against whatever bills the other party present, regardless of whether the bill will actually be beneficial to our country. It seems the only truly bipartisan ""issue"" is to give Congress another raise.  Since there are only two parties, no real change or progress can be made: Obama did x, y, and z during his terms and Trump undid a lot of it. Then Biden undid a lot of what Trump did. Now Trump is undoing a lot of what Biden did. Assuming a Dem wins the next election, they will spend 4 years undoing what Trump did this term. But since there will be no real change, a Republican will win the election after that one and spend 4 years undoing what their Dem predecessor did.

"That's funny, because you complain about Democratic candidates that sound like Republicans but you sound just like them yourself. Martin Luther King Jr. specifically called out that exact kind of behavior from politicians back in the late 50's and early 60's, how they always said ""later, later"" whenever it came to dealing with civil rights issues but funny enough later never actually comes. Those people are never economically satisfied enough to want to deal with those problems, because you yourself aren't suffering from them; it's always something you can deal with later, once you've had yours.          Trump's led a massive attack on civil rights that has set back civil rights for 50+ years and isn't done yet, attacking women's rights and trying to bury the achievements and rights of black citizens while saying equality is his goal over and over again. And your strategy is to just...ignore that, and talk about the economy.          Nobody buys it when it's their rights on the line and you keep telling them ""we'll get to it later, once we've gotten to what I want first."" And they shouldn't, because it's always a lie.
