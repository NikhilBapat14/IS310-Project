"Since Russian troops invaded [Ukraine](https://www.wired.com/tag/ukraine/) more than three years ago, Russian technology companies and executives have been [widely](https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/perspectives/advisories/2024/06/russias-access-to-it-services-and-software-restricted) [sanctioned](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkx14jykn8o) for supporting the Kremlin. That includes [Vladimir Kiriyenko](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=34596), the son of one of Vladimir Putin’s top aides and the [CEO](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/26/22951307/us-sanctions-russia-vk-ceo-vladimir-kiriyenko) of VK Group, which runs VK, Russia’s Facebook equivalent that has [increasingly shifted towards the regime’s repressive positioning.](https://www.wired.com/story/vk-russia-democracy/)  Now cybersecurity researchers are warning that a widely used piece of [open source code](https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-open-source-software/)—which is linked to Kiriyenko’s company and managed by Russian developers—may pose a “persistent” national security risk to the United States.
