">Despite being trumpeted as the administration’s first deal since last month’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, the agreement with the United Kingdom appeared to be more of a framework than a full deal, with more discussions required before both sides can sign off.  Soooo....incomplete, not a deal, still negotiating...just another day and another lie from Trump.",Boring_Investment597,2025-05-08T13:05:35,110
"Desperate 11th hour calls are a sure sign of getting a great deal… for the other side. And it still isn’t done! The Brits are calling it a template  for the finished deal.   Like always, Trump just wants the show.",travio,2025-05-08T13:05:24,34

"With a press conference already scheduled to announce the “historic” pact, Trump was desperate to get the agreement over the line. He intervened at the last minute, placing a late-night call to British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to save what would be his first trade “deal.”  Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. referenced the call during remarks in the Oval Office, saying: “Thank you very much indeed for that very typical 11th-hour intervention by you with your phone call demanding even more out of this deal than any of us expected.”  “The prime minister was delighted to take that call late at night,” he added, smiling. “You took it to another level.”  Trump declined to explain why he called Starmer, saying only it was “one other little thing.”  [**Read the full story**](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-desperate-11th-hour-call-to-save-first-trade-deal/).",thedailybeast,2025-05-08T13:00:49,18

"Why the fuck would they want to import American beef, which had already failed their standards previously, now that we’re cutting inspections at the fda?",prodigalpariah,2025-05-08T13:34:46,7
"The deal isn’t even good. Like please correct me if I’m wrong but we, as consumers and to some extent American citizens, are getting the worst end of the deal.  - UK decrease tariffs on their imports. In theory good if they buy more but lower import tariffs won’t necessarily lead to uk importing more from us.  - we have higher tariffs on imports from them. We, the consumer are paying more. That’s awful for us. You could possibly argue it’s good for the nation but that increase in revenue is of the backs of the American consumers. On top of this I f things cost more demand will go down and less will be bought. There has to be some point that consumers are buying less will be less tariff generation overall compared to how things were.  - the photo he shared has a ton of fluff in their “market” portion. A lot of what he claimed we gained access to aren’t even goods we buy a lot from them. Most of them are goods the US excels at producing so really it seems to be more detrimental to our production in those industries.  Again I’m not an economist or even know a ton about how trade works but this seems like a “potentially decent”(prob more bad than good) deal nationally but bad to horrible for American citizens. Please someone correct me if this thinking is wrong.",AcidRohnin,2025-05-08T15:52:27,5

Yeah but American meat includes chlorinated chickens laying chlorinated eggs washed with chlorine,imaginary_num6er,2025-05-08T16:54:38,1
"It only includes beef that meets UK food standards. And it will need to be inspected and proven. So no growth-hormone laden beef, or chlorinated crap. We don't want it, but if it meets standards, it's basically the price of not trashing our steel and car exports with 25% tariffs, and supposedly less tariffs for pharmaceuticals, a big industry here.  Also our food standards require very visible country of origin labelling for meat. Given the US is about as popular here as genital warts right now, I suspect it's not exactly going to fly off the shelves.  With the 10% tariffs on everything else we're still worse off for jobs, but it's about damage limitation from the mango moron.",Arkhanist,2025-05-09T01:31:40,1
