"I think ""David Hogg beef"" is a funny phrase, shouldn't it be pork?  You can watch an exchange they had on Youtube earlier yesterday here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syor3Xxvrh4  It was a fascinating conversation to listen to.",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-05-01T14:28:55,13
"If it is okay for AIPAC to blow out Reps like Cori Bush, it is ok for Hogg to try and blow out other reps.",The-Real-Number-One,2025-05-01T14:53:34,14

Welp. There goes Carville's Fox News air time -- for now.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-01T14:37:04,11
Does this mean he's officially... Boss Hogg?,Sad_Importance7789,2025-05-01T15:59:32,2
"This is the first year heâ€™s legal to run for the house. 5 years until the senate. 5 years until heâ€™s legal to be governor of Florida. 10 years before he can be president. I donâ€™t know what heâ€™s going to pick, but itâ€™s coming and Iâ€™m here for it.",OneSketchyMama,2025-05-01T21:04:21,2
Carville wants the dnc to oust sanders and distance itself from AOC. Arguably two of their partyâ€™s most appealing voices to independents.,typkrft,2025-05-01T20:28:37,1
I do not want to see James Carville and David Hogg pork.,rocc_high_racks,2025-05-01T14:36:14,19

Thank you for that mental image ðŸ¤£,DevinGraysonShirk,2025-05-01T14:42:05,5
but why? is there a rule only establishment dems can punch against others in their own party?,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T16:00:51,11
*No one* in the DNC is endorsing primary candidates or starting PACs to fund them.   Hogg is the first to propose this and it would set a dangerous precedent.,Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-01T16:08:55,-7
a dangerous precedent of what? Is meddling in primaries only okay when the establishment allows AIPAC to spend 100 million dollars against progressive candidates?,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T16:10:43,12
"You're missinformed, the DNC doesn't ""allow"" AIPAC to spend anything.   AIPAC is a private organization, it has no links to the DNC. They have zero ability to stop them from spending money, and the same is true for progressive PACs like Our Revolution and Justice Democrats.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-01T16:16:14,-3
"Thatâ€™s just trying to be clever. To claim the DCCC has no power over what money gets spent in its private club elections is just laughable.  The democratic party can write whatever rules it wants for how its primaries are conducted.  Is it ever concerning to anyone else that the centrists ALWAYS have a reason for why things canâ€™t be improved and they ALWAYS have some excuse for why they canâ€™t do anything about the current system?  edit: A good read on DMFI and AIPAC. https://theintercept.com/2022/10/16/democratic-party-progressive-israel-aipac-dmfi/  The idea that the democratic party has no recourse when right wing organizations are spending millions of dollars in democratic primaries is beyond reality, even for centrists to claim.",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T16:25:52,6
I need you to understand that you're objectively wrong here. Preventing these groups from spending money in any election including primaries would literally be unconstitutional. There is no debate over this.,Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-01T16:46:59,-1
"Here it is everyone. The centrist saying the democratic party has no control over its private club elections. The democratic party is seemingly never out of ideas when it comes to punching left, but when it comes to stopping the right, they say itâ€™s not possible.  Iâ€™m fairly confident the DNC and all its lawyers can write a rule that would make spending by right wing organizations in democratic primaries an effort in futility. We donâ€™t have to come up with the wording for them, but it is 100% possible.   We arenâ€™t talking about a real election. Weâ€™re talking about a club where their own layers argued in court they can select candidates in a back room if they wanted.  edit: grammar",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T16:52:22,6
">Iâ€™m fairly confident   Yeah it's called the [Dunning-Kruger effect. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)  Maybe you don't understand what unconstitutional means, but it means the DNC **literally** has zero ability to stop individuals and private organizations from donating money to political campaigns. No, DNC lawyers cannot rewrite the constitution. I can't make this any simpler, you're going to have to at least put a little effort into critical thinking on your end here.  This has nothing to do with punching left or right, they can't ban progressive PACs from spending money for the exact same reason. It's literally the law.",Hoodrow-Thrillson,2025-05-01T17:08:18,2
I never once said to force people or organizations from not spending money. Itâ€™s 100% possible for a rule to be made that would make any attempt by right wing orgs to buy primaries to be akin to setting money on fire. But what do i know. Iâ€™m sure the democratic party is doing everything they can do win elections. Iâ€™m just a silly voter who knows nothing. Guess iâ€™ll sit out next time too ðŸ˜˜,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-01T17:10:23,7
