"Last week, there was that video of him holding up an entire plane for refusing to put on his seatbelt. Seems like he's not doing too well mentally.",Philosophical-Emu,2025-05-08T03:30:38,32
He *should* at least know he can retire without major consequences for his state. Shapiro would get to pick a replacement.   His voters aren't happy nor other party members. That is if he is done pretending he cares about what he ran on in the first place anymore.,longtermattention,2025-05-08T03:31:38,16

"This is just sad. Everything we’re seeing tracks with the kind of cognitive decline that can follow a major stroke. If his constituents think he can’t do the job anymore, they have every right to push for change. But we should still recognize what’s happening. This is a human being struggling with the aftermath of a serious medical event. You can want accountability without throwing out basic compassion.",Kei_the_gamer,2025-05-08T06:05:37,16
"That stroke really changed him, and he's apparently regressing in his depression treatment. He is not well and needs to step down.",LordSiravant,2025-05-08T05:28:31,6
"Emotional regulation post-stroke is a challenge as the brain needs to develop new synaptic pathways.  That requires the support of physicians, psychiatrists and psychologists to help the patient.  OK.  The challenge with Fetterman is he doesn't seem to be doing that work.  I have empathy for him in his recovery, but if he isn't going to seek the assistance needed, he should not be working in such an important capacity.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-05-08T08:40:36,2
