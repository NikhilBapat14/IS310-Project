Then why are they still voting in line in support of the most insane shit???,surferrossaa,2025-04-29T20:29:55,-3
"How many years ago was that? 20 hours of hearings, months and years ago from our 262 Democrats in Congress and many more in State and Local Government is pretty thin in my opinion.  If you expect nothing from your government, you will get nothing.",OldJames47,2025-04-29T20:29:08,-5
"They need to be running PSAs, putting up billboards, being visible. You are in a Dem bubble. Its easy to say ""They already know all of this!! Dems told them!"" But every new atrocity needs to be plastered everywhere- not just CNN and online safe spaces. Go to any rural area and none of those people have a clue what's going on, but they know all about the negative things Trump says about Dems. Why is that? Why do Dems smugly sit aside, saying ""I told you so"" instead of trying to reach all Americans? Your thought process and their attitude is a large part of the reason Harris didn't win. I tried to convince as many fence sitters as I could, but they just did not know much of her platform at all. That is squarely on Democratic leadership and their inability or unwillingness to push boundaries and overload all spaces with their messaging.",RobonianBattlebot,2025-04-29T22:55:09,-2

If you and your entire party and media ecosystem are comfortable straight up lying and you can be confident that when you tell that lie every other part of your party and media ecosystem will repeat that lie you can accomplish great things.  Terrible things but great none the less.  See China pays the tariffs for example.  Or tax cuts for the rich pay for themselves or TRUMP WON 2020.,DutchGoFast,2025-04-29T22:09:44,3
"Are you serious?  I expect people to care about electing a fascist.  I don't expect that to fade over time, no.",pinetreesgreen,2025-04-29T20:31:38,10
"The democrat members of the house and senate? Ok, Jan 🙄",surferrossaa,2025-04-29T20:33:11,-5
"It’s about reaching the people who don’t care and show them why they should.  Yes, people should be better and I expect them to be. But they aren’t.   So we need a Democratic Party that is always on the offensive pushing the message and leading the fight. Waiting for the Sunday talk shows and writing strongly worded letters are not going to hold back the deluge of constant messaging from Republicans.",OldJames47,2025-04-29T20:36:33,2
"Are you going to expect the politicians, that supposedly called Trump out for 2 years, to care about stopping said fascist? Or is sending Trump a strongly worded letter with 8 questions enough for you?",JewsieJay,2025-04-29T21:51:38,0
"No, the public.  The Dems in Congress have been shouting from the rafters for two years now Trump is a danger to democracy.  People laughed at them.",pinetreesgreen,2025-04-29T20:34:31,2
You’re telling us Dems screamed this for two years and then every Dem in the Senate immediately voted in favor of Trump’s nomination for Secretary of State? Why wouldn’t Americans laugh at them?,JewsieJay,2025-04-29T21:47:56,2
