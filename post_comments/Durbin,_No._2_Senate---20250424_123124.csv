">His retirement also will open up a top Democratic leadership position for the first time in a decade.  [Senate race to replace Durbin boasts ‘at least a dozen’ serious contenders](https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/04/23/dick-durbin-senate-reelection-decision-krishnamoorthi-underwood-stratton)  >Expect Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi and Rep. Lauren Underwood to launch bids within hours and days of Sen. Dick Durbin’s announcement that he will not seek reelection in the Senate, a seat he has held since winning his first term in 1996.   ...   U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly and State Treasurer Michael Frerichs are also expected to jump into the race. Frerichs and Underwood have both conducted polling. And former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who is busy spreading the word on the failures of the Democratic Party, has also said he would be open to run for a local race, although he’s got his eye on the governor’s race should Gov. JB Pritzker opt out of a third term.  >Stratton and Krishnamoorthi have treated Durbin’s pending announcement delicately — heaping public praise on the senator while playing coy about their potential runs. The two are among those who have spoken to Durbin personally. Durbin said he took calls from potential candidates to mean they would be seeking his endorsement.   ...   Former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon endorsed Durbin as his successor in 1996 — and the big question is whether Durbin will do the same. Simon was the state’s most popular Democratic officeholder at the time of his endorsement. And Durbin has heightened his popularity with Democrats by fighting back against President Donald Trump. An endorsement from the outgoing senator could play a huge role in the race and bolster cash and endorsements from prominent unions, politicians and Democratic power players.",brain_overclocked,2025-04-24T12:35:06,2
