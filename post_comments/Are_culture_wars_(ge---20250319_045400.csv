I think that social discussion has been used to mask or divert from class issues. I don’t think it was created to do so; just taken advantage of.,WaltzingBosun,2025-03-19T13:39:12,74
"Human rights and class struggle are intertwined. But yes the right wing does use these issues to say ""we will be overtaken by immigrants/Gays vote for us vote for us and we'll kick em in the balls"" and then proceed to kick the working class in the balls",Xaphan2080,2025-03-19T13:56:59,45
"Yes, it does distract from class issues, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t happening or that everyone engaging in it is involved in a massive conspiracy. Immigrants and trans people are being attacked whether it’s a distraction or not.    There are definitely cynical actors who take advantage of the culture wars to protect their economic interests (Elon Musk for example I don’t think gives two fucks about these social issues but sees how effective they are.)  But that doesn’t mean that the entire political system is coordinating to generate this as theater.  There are Republican members of congress who genuinely believe some of these things and Democrats who genuinely oppose them, and there are real life consequences.  I also think that when people are making this argument they tend to overstate how unified people with common economic interests actually are. It’s of course true that I as a middle class liberal would benefit from the same policies that would benefit a middle class conservative, but if that person doesn’t recognize my trans friends right to exist or is a racist then we still have fundamental disagreements that are not illusions.    We may not even agree on how our common economic interests are served.  They might say “Yea, let’s look out for the middle class, get rid of all income taxes and kick out the immigrants.” while I’m saying “Yea, let’s look out for the middle class, we need to raise taxes on the rich and establish universal healthcare.”",MattVideoHD,2025-03-19T14:32:37,16
"Without question.  There was a moment where the Tea Party and the occupy wallstreet movement were kind of moving in the same direction.

Cultural differences are completely different than class struggles.  It's completely 100% honestly crazy how you can think with today's politics that it isn't about cultural differences rather than class struggles.     It's pretty clear Republicans care deeply about cultural issues over class issues.,DarkExecutor,2025-03-19T17:13:16,10
"I think it's more interesting to look at the criticism itself and what it says about that person's view of modern politics.  >Are culture wars used to divert attention from class struggle?  The first thing the question tells us is they think the class struggle is/should be the core of politics.   The second is they think there is a concerted effort by someone/s to keep people from the class struggle.  The third is they think this is done through focusing on the culture struggle instead of the class struggle.   The question itself presupposes that class struggle is the core of politics.   The question also presupposes that those on the side that favour the status quo will attempt to divert attention away from class struggle.   The final presupposition is that culture is a *false* issue only being used to distract from the *true* issue, class.  For all those presuppositions to be true one has to accept a basic Marxist/materialist outlook on politics and that ones opponents also accept it and thus intentionally distract from it with things the same person considers to be trivial but inflammatory, in this case culture.  This is a fantastic strawman, but it doesn't really hold up when compared to reality.   Most conservatives don't buy into Marxist/materialism, they don't accept that culture is trivial, and they certainly don't think they are behaving cynically to prevent class struggle. From their perspective it is the left that has engaged in a continuous struggle to change their culture without their permission. They see the left altering culture through controlling key cultural institutions (universities, schools, art, civil administration, judiciary, etc...) which they then see as a top down attempt to enforce leftist views and ultimately *brainwash* their children out of traditionalism.   Ironically the left don't see any of this as an issue. There's certainly a sense among the left that they have a right to control cultural institutions and prevent them from being used to propagate right wing views, because it's *propaganda*, but then don't see the same issue with them pushing their own ideas because they are *moral*.  Ultimately, both sides are unable to understand why the other acts the way they do, because they totally dismiss the other side's analysis as illegitimate.  Yes, the right wing elite do use cultural issues to distract from class issues, but that doesn't invalidate the cultural issues. Those issues are just as legitimate, even if the elite are using them as a distraction.",FudgeAtron,2025-03-19T15:21:29,10
"In Japan, same-sex marriage is still not legal despite a large majority supporting it. Because most voters do not change their votes based on the issue and still vote for right-wing parties. Is it a distraction from economic issues like tax and benefits?  In France, workers have enjoyed one of the strongest labor rights and protections in the world for more than a century from even before women got suffrage. Yet, poc activists have pushed for a racial reckoning that would include end of constitutional colorblindness and repealing the ban on racial and ethnic statistics. Yet, sociologists have long attacked French secularism laws as discriminatory against Muslim minorities. Yet, regional minorities demand to be legally recognized and granted linguistic rights. Do these attacks on French ""republican values"" divert attention from class issues like pensions and taxes?  In Eastern Europe, center-left social democratic parties are socially conservative in general and oppose same-sex marriage. Is this ok?  Was the civil rights movement in the 60s a distraction because it caused a political realignment that ended the New Deal/Great Society supermajority of the Democratic Party?  Fyi, nowadays academics in sociology and related fields like ethnic studies and post-colonial studies see the notion that identity politics and culture wars being a distraction from class struggle as very much outdated.",GalahadDrei,2025-03-19T18:11:25,6
"Personally, I tend to find those that argue that social law is a distraction tend to just expect the other side to accede to their position.  I tend to say that economic politics allow you to live, while social politics allow you to live in a place that you want to live. As an example, just because I could live in Egypt with a high standard of living, does not mean that I want to live there even if where I am currently living offers a much lower standard of living. There would be linguistic, cultural, racial, religious, and other differences which would make living there much less pleasant.   Was the civil rights movement of the 60's a distraction?   I am just speculating, but I would imagine if you went through history, you would see ebs and flows where society is more concerned with economics vs more concerned with social change. Once one picks up steam it tends to dominate the discourse for a couple of decades and then something else switches. The past 20 years have seen some fairly major social changes, I am old enough to remember when Gay marriage became legal. Currently we are grappling with what it means to have a certain sex or gender. As well as the relationships between races and genders.   Too be honest, I feel as though the social change is losing steam. Both the left and right are asking for economic reform and I predict that in about 5 years, economics will be the topic de jure.",JohnTEdward,2025-03-19T13:58:44,6
"This implies that people are being tricked or manipulated. It's true that some are, but for some they actually care about cultural issues due to no tricks or manipulation.",CrawlerSiegfriend,2025-03-20T10:57:49,5
Of course they are. It doesn’t mean the cultural issues don’t exist. But politicians play on them to encourage their supporters to feel entitled to dictate to the rest of the country.,ResurgentOcelot,2025-03-19T14:19:24,5
"Has someone somewhere used culture issues to distract from economic issues? Invariably, yes.  Are culture issues largely the result of a conspiracy to distract the masses from class issues? No.",bl1y,2025-03-19T20:27:52,5
"No, they're just important issues for a lot of voters.  People have wanted ""class struggle"" to be a thing in the United States for ages without success.  Class simply is not a big deal in the United States, and doesn't have real impacts on people's day-to-day.  Generally speaking, you have no idea of the class of a person you interact with. Simply doesn't matter.    The left in particular continues to be baffled that the cultural issues the electorate *does* care about - often involving religious beliefs or their own personal economic standing - aren't the same as the issues that they prioritize.  Thus, they slag on the issues they don't care about and pretend people are being hoodwinked or distracted.    Long and short, class struggle is not a thing except in theoretical left-wing spaces, and shouldn't be prioritized.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-03-19T16:29:34,11
"I don't think so.  Conservatives legitimately feel the way they do about these issues.  They don't see lgbt as human,  don't believe in rights for lots of people,  etc.  If you believe these people don't genuinely feel the way they so about these issues, you are naive and live in a bubble",FrostyArctic47,2025-03-19T13:50:49,10
"Yes, I believe they are.   It's not that those things aren't important in their own right, but I think it's very intentional it's the only things that are talked about.   Identity politics, specifically, I think is meant to remove focus from class. This was the case when bernie sanders ran for president and focused on the class war and raising the lower and middle classes. He was called racist because he didn't mainly focus on race issues, despite all the class issues inherently helping minority populations, and this was used to drive people against him. Everything is we need a black/hispanic/gay/woman/nonbinary whoever instead of someone with policy ideas that will help the average american worker.   Same thing with the republicans, just a different strategy. Immigrants are the reason for class issues, they're the reasons you can't find good jobs, etc. Immigration is its own issue, but it's a scapegoat to not have genuine solutions to the dwindling middle class.",HangryHipppo,2025-03-21T12:08:24,2

"It's used for a few things in addition to being a diversion: First, it pulls in single-issue voters, especially the older Fox viewers. Second, it goes after small marginalized groups that it believes few outside those groups will defend. And Third, it moves the Overton Window so that persecution of marginalized groups is seen as becoming the new normal ergo moving on to other groups and creating a new ""Other"" to fear.  As LBJ famously said: “If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you.”  This is what the neo-facists/racists are riding and are assuming that we the people are too scared or apathetic to fight back.",wyrmfood,2025-03-21T15:12:06,2
the answer to that is yes and it is at this point mainly the right wing and republicans doing it but that is not to say democrats do not and for example i know that feminism for a while was very tied into the democratic party and so many of the issues they supposedly cared about either seemed trivial or anti male.,Fit-Commission-2626,2025-03-21T20:14:06,2

"In general society? I think people just like to talk about issues that are attention grabbing, sometimes that's economic, sometimes not.  Within the Democratic party? Definitely. When Sanders was barnstorming in '16, Clinton and the party in general viewed social progressivism as the way to fight him off, hence stuff like this:  >“Not everything is about an economic theory, right? If we broke up the big banks tomorrow — and I will if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will — would that end racism?”",WillowWorker,2025-03-22T08:34:26,2
No.    They really actually care about culture war stuff.

"The difference between right-wing populism and left-wing populism is that the former tends to focus on cultural / racial / ethnic issues, while the latter is focused on class and wealth.  It's not a matter of distraction.  There are simply more populists who are motivated by these right-wing hot buttons that there are those who are moved by those on the left.  Class struggle doesn't appeal to a lot of people.  Accept that and move on.  If you want to get somewhere, then focus on pitching simple policy items that don't require a lot of explanation and can be packaged for the middle and some of the right.  Issues such as the minimum wage tend to appeal to populists on both sides.  Present it as working people being paid what they deserve for their hard work, rather than as some battle against the power structure.  That entails forming coalitions across the spectrum that include others who share some similar policy objectives but who do not necessarily share your motivations.",I405CA,2025-03-19T14:42:29,6
"No, this is just copium from parts of the left that idealised the working class as being the vanguard of the fight against capitalism or something and are now mad that the working class has turned against them and even allied with some crooked billionnaires in doing so, just because of what they see as cultural issues. But those cultural issues truly are more important that economic issues to the working class right now.  I would go as far as saying that those culture wars are actually a form of class warfare. It is a war between a white working class that is often racist, sexist, fascist, homophobic and culturally conservative, against both an underclass of poor non-white immigrants and against an upper-middle class that is often liberal, college-educated, and cosmopolitan, both of whom are culturally very different from them, and who are both in concurrence with them for jobs. Because good jobs with decent pay now often require to have a college education, so the working class is locked out of them to the profit of the upper-middle class, while the working class is also in concurrence even for bad jobs with poor immigrants who are willing to accept lower salaries and working conditions for them. So this is both a cultural and an economic war from the point of view of the working class.   And this is happening everywhere in the West: In the U.S., the U.K, France, Germany, Italy, Austria, and so on. The white working class is increasingly and massively voting for the far-right everywhere. This is happening because of important social and economic changes in our societies that occurred in the last 40 years and that caused the rise of a college-educated upper-middle class and a decline of the blue-collar working class that now feels left behind by society, both economically and culturally. This is not happening because of specific policies from the part of the left, because the European Left is struggling just as much with it than the American Left, despite defending policies that are much more friendly to the working-class.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-03-20T01:16:57,5
Honestly I think the Democratic Party (at least the upper echelon of leaders) does use social and class issues to virtue signal instead of addressing economic inequality. Biden’s presidency definitely saw the rich get richer and the poor struggle more. Nothing meaningful was done to stop the asset/real estate boom or curb inflation. ,[deleted],2025-03-19T15:52:46,3
"Abso-fucking-lutely.  The political and economic elite are more than happy to keep people screaming at each other over culture wars and other similar issues while they quietly rig the economy in their favor. Ultra wealthy donors, politicians, media conglomerates, and propagandists both foreign and domestic all play their part in manufacturing division.  That doesn’t mean the issues themselves are fake. The best propaganda doesn’t fabricate. It distorts and amplifies. Racism, LGBTQ+ rights, immigration. These are life and death struggles for the people being targeted. But for the ruling class? They’re tools. Distractions. The people at the top are rich enough to be unaffected by these fights, and they have no problem weaponizing them.  For the average person, none of it actually solves their problems. But easy anger and outrage are addictive. They fill some festering, unfulfilled gap left by the grind of modern wage slavery. People are anxious and crave something to be self righteous about even if they are wrong and shitty people for it. So many of them are too stupid and monkey brained to do anything other than take on the constant bombardment of propaganda spoon fed to them as their own  No one is losing their home because of trans athletes. Stagnating wages aren’t caused by undocumented immigrants. But these are the fights that dominate the news cycle because they give people a false sense of purpose, no matter how misguided. Meanwhile, if the same energy were directed toward wealth inequality, unchecked corporate power, or the erosion of labor rights, the ruling class would have a real crisis on its hands.  The media knows exactly how to game this. Just look at one of today’s headlines about Trump ""suffering"" multiple legal “blows.” We’ve been bombarded with this same style narrative for a decade. Something is always happening or about to happen. They tease us with something resembling a cathartic moment. They want you to believe justice is creeping closer, that the system is holding powerful people accountable. At this point, it’s psychological abuse.  Nothing comes of it. Billionaire sociopaths still run the country. Wealth is still consolidating at the top. Everyday people are still depressed as fuck and struggling to get by. There's no sense of community any more. The only real difference now is that we’re hurtling full speed toward whatever the fuck comes next. Maybe it’s a cyberpunk dystopia where corporations control everything because they’re richer than most nations. Maybe the filthy peasants finally reach their breaking point and pick up their pitchforks. Neither solution sounds all that pleasant for the average shmuck.  This isn’t just about division. It’s about exhaustion. It’s about keeping people too demoralized to push for real systemic change while spoon feeding them selective outrage. It’s working beautifully for them. Their side is the profitable one. They have the money to keep hiring people to do their dirty work. When people get used up, or too demonized to be useful, replace them with another paid clown.

No. I think this argument is almost exclusively made by straight white male progressives who want to re-center themselves as the main character.

"Not to both sides.... But.     Your premise is a bit off, class wars and culture wars aren't different battle grounds.    Civil rights, women suffrage were big issues, clear divide when we look back it's obvious, women should have the right to vote, to have a credit card. Race should not determine what bathroom you use, what services you get, how you are or.. are not paid...     Culture wars are the small battle on the edge of the same issue.  From there... The class structure and race/gender discrimination have many overlaps. This is not new... Wealth used to (deliberately still does) directly follow family lines, titles would be inherited, land and jobs would pass from one generation to the next. To ensure power can be passed from one to another they created laws were formulated to ensure they would always have a foot up. If you can't make a law that says only Smyth's get to run for government how can you ensure your Smyth's family success?  Well... Your all white so we can start there.... Names pass on the fathers side so we can add males only... But those are gone now... So... We can only rely on other traits.  While the opposition can't just make a law saying no Smyth's... They can chisel away at everything else... At the same time, they are a Smyth and living comfortably.... Getting a Smyth to change the rules that benefit them so much is hard.  Without a revolution kicking out all the Smyths it's near impossible to make major changes. Small wins are wins.

"Absolutely fucking not!! I am so damn tired of this narrative, it's *not* true. And it's really, really fucking insulting to women and minorities who are being *specifically* targeted by this regime due to pure hatred and a desire to put them back in their place. It's not some ploy to ""distract"" from class struggle!! We are *actually* being denied rights that white men have. The oppression of women and minorities isn't a fucking ""distraction"" from the ostensibly more important ""oppression"" of white working class men LOL gtfo. It's REAL. Our oppression is real. Misogyny and racism are real and a part of the structure of our society! The narrative that it's *actually* a class war and women's suffering and the suffering of minorities is all a ""distraction"" from THEIR problems is based on misogyny and racism. Because the denial of misogyny and racism in society of any kind, even this bullshit narrative about how is *actually* a ""class war,"" is literally racism and misogyny.   Women and minorities make up the vast, vast majority of the poor. Almost all people making minimum wage are women, and especially women of color. Stats show the only white men making minimum wage are under 25. After that, *none* of them do. But women make minimum wage. And don't get raises the way men do.   1 in 9 women are in serious poverty. 20% of black and Hispanics are in poverty. Only 7.7% of white people are in poverty and the vast majority of that 7.7% are *women.* That's no accident. I'm serious, if you are a straight, able bodied white male you are literally *not* in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are. You're simply not. Maybe they are struggling, but it's the difference between struggling at 50k a year and 30k a year. You're acting like there is this large homogeneous group called ""the poor"" that the rich are coming after, and that is simply *not true* at all. The SERIOUSLY poor are almost exclusively women and minorities (with groups like the disabled being defined as a minority).   The *only* white men that are poor in the way women and minorities are, are the mentally ill, disabled and addicted. If you're a straight white man and you aren't any of those things, you're not going to be ""trapped"" in poverty under Trump LOL. You are literally NOT experiencing the kind of poverty women and minorities are. All his policies are *not going to affect you.* They aren't *meant* to affect you!! Straight white men who think this is ""a class war"" have no fucking CLUE what actual oppression is. White men have always had economic opportunities and the opportunity to self actualize in a way women and minorities didn't. The ""poor"" were not being kept down, the vast, vast majority of the poor are and always have been women and minorities!! EXCEPT during the Industrial Revolution! But that time is long gone. That kind of *actual* class warfare is not really here anymore.   The Trump administration coming after the programs that allowed women and minorities to gain more and more equality with white men are being taken away. Those same programs are the programs for the poor. Because they ARE the poor!!! Food stamps are being taken away. Why? Because almost all the people using food stamps are single mothers. The vast majority of people on Medicaid are women and minorities. Free daycare like headstart is being taken away, why? Because those programs enable women to be able to work. They are literally making it so women have to rely on men again. They are taking away the support system not of the poor, but the systems that allowed women independence from men. Their goal is to create a white nationalist, male supremacist regime. Not necessarily to increase inequality in general.   White men, even poor white men have *always* had their rights enshrined in the constitution. The rights of white men are not up to be voted on, ever! Ours are though. Women and minorities (including gay and transgender people) have had *their* rights denied to them, and now they are stripping  those hard won rights from us *again!* The rights of the ""poor"" are not being taken away, women and minorities rights SPECIFICALLY are. Women and minorities have been oppressed in this country on the basis of their sex and race *alone.* Not their class.   MAGA is a far right, white nationalist and male supremacist cult of personality. Trump himself is very corrupt and he is allowing the rich to bribe him  and giving the rich favors in exchange for their votes and to keep him in power. But the primary goal of his administration is not to increase inequality for the sake of subjugating *all* of the poor. Musk wanting to privatize social security and Medicare for example, is simply to make HIM richer, he doesn't see it as him getting richer at the expense of the poor. Privatization of those programs will primarily affect women and minorities!! For most white men, it'll actually result in a greater return on their social security investment! But women and minorities face discrimination in the workplace that white men don't, and now with anti-DEI it's going to get worse. White men are not going to have issues increasing their income if they need to. They are given promotions, raises, etc. It's a boys club at the top!!   Women are being forced into reproductive slave labor for the state. And being forced to pay for it themselves because they won't have access to Medicare!!! Brown people are being sent to Guantanamo bay. And you think this is mostly a class war and not a war on women and minorities??? Literally right now there is a bill in the senate to limit women's right to vote.   Most of the wealthy believe in the myth of the world being a ""meritocracy."" If you have merit, you won't be poor. To them, if you are poor you had the opportunity to not be poor *even without any social services,* and so it's YOUR fault if you are. They aren't trying to keep white men poor, they literally don't think white men *have* to be poor at all! In their regime, if they succeed, white men will all have the *same opportunities.* They won't *need* government safety nets. Whether or not they are rich is due to *merit* in their world. If a white man is poor in their regime, it's because he doesn't have ""merit"" not because they are consciously oppressing him. They are delusional. There is no class war in the U.S right now in the way you're implying. We are not in the time of factories or monarchies. The world has changed.   Now. That being said, they did straw man identity politics on the left to get support. But that's only because they can't straight up be like ""yeah we just hate women, minorities and gay and trans people and we want to oppress them again."" So they pretend the left is harming society with their ""identity politics."" But the goal is the oppression of women and minorities. People needed to be able to vote for a white nationalist and male supremacist regime that they want while being able to hide their true motives. And misrepresenting identity politics and painting liberals as the enemy, the right as saving ""freedom"" was a good way to do it.  It's also true that they are taking away things like the ability to unionize. THAT can be interpreted as a ""class war."" But I'd argue Musk's primary concern there is that he doesn't want to be held responsible for his OSHA and safety violations and get shut down. It's not about keeping the poor, poor.

And yet I am not so opposed to capitalism that I have failed to see its relative merits. It started out with a noble and high motive, to block the trade monopolies of nobles, but like most human system it fell victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has outlived its usefulness. It has brought about a system that takes necessities from the masses to give luxuries to the classes. . . . Our economic system is going through a radical change, and certainly this change is needed. I would certainly welcome the day to come when there will be a nationalization of industry. Let us continue to hope, work, and pray that in the future we will live to see a warless world, a better distribution of wealth, and a brotherhood that transcends race or color.

"I'm a socialist and in 2022 I lived for a year in a shared house with 4 Trump voters.   We talked politics a lot, and we had a gentleman's agreement not to talk about culture wars issues for the sake of harmonious living, but we spoke a great deal about class and money and power, and there was a consensus that I would describe as pro-socialist.    They were all in unions, they all hated working too long, they all hated private health care, they all hated big money capturing government, and they weren't even big fans of the GOP - they saw them as corrupt and working for the rich.   They knew I had campaigned for Bernie and they all liked him and, importantly, trusted him, even if they weren't sold on all his ideas.    They also thought (incorrectly, but whatever) I was a homosexual because I went clubbing in San Francisco wearing PVC trousers and makeup, but they were cool with it.

That way we can be sure to allow our plan to go into action irregardless of what party wins. I think that compromise on most issues is very reasonable and cuts out alot of things that are problems in both parties, neither party is fully correct instead we should focus on what the issues are. There is not a single person with a comprehensive plan that does not fully undercut the opposing party for instance what has Biden done to further the republicans concerns or how many times has Donald Trump conceded to the Democrats never that is the problem with electing politicians they are a cult of personality rather than solving issues. If they ever had anything to do with the other party they would ousted but those people are our nieghbors and we love them they are very understandable such as being compassionate towards minorities and giving them opportunities is a very virtuous thing while simultaneously wanting to maintain the great culture we already have and appreciate what people have done for us is also virtuous so when people claim either side is so terrible for being on one side they are coming from a place that is disingenuous thus not based in reality like a person that is a cult of personality.

Just look up the US geological studies if you really want to know what is going on. Interests are oil, rare earth metals, natural resources, shipping routes and multinational corporations that have likely been in these countries for decades.   Hawaii is a good example. Dole pineapple Sanford B. Dole, a prominent figure in Hawaii's sugar and pineapple industries, was a key leader in the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. He and other wealthy American and European businessmen sought annexation to secure their economic interests, particularly to avoid tariffs on sugar exports to the U.S. In 1893, Queen Liliʻuokalani attempted to restore power to the Hawaiian monarchy by drafting a new constitution. This alarmed American businessmen who feared losing their influence. U.S. Minister John L. Stevens, orchestrated a coup against the Queen. U.S. Marines from the USS Boston were deployed to Honolulu under the pretext of protecting American lives and property but effectively supported the coup.  Edward Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud, is often referred to as the ""father of public relations"" or ""the father of spin."" He's known for his work in manipulating public opinion and shaping consumer behavior through the use of propaganda and psychological techniques. Bernays' work laid the foundation for modern public relations, advertising, and propaganda.  Bernays' most famous book, ""Propaganda"" (1928), outlined his approach to shaping public opinion. He argued that the manipulation of public opinion was necessary in a democratic society, as the public was not capable of making informed decisions on its own. He believed that a small group of intelligent and enlightened individuals should guide public opinion.  Most common techniques used are:  1. Agenda setting: Selectively choosing which stories to cover and how to frame them to influence public opinion. 2. Framing: Presenting information in a way that influences how people perceive and interpret it. 3. Primacy effect: Presenting information in a way that creates a lasting impression, often by using sensational or provocative headlines. 4. Social proof: Using social media influencers, celebrity endorsements, or fake online reviews to create the illusion of widespread support or acceptance. 5. Gaslighting: Manipulating people into doubting their own perceptions or sanity, often by presenting contradictory information or denying previous statements. 6. Confirmation bias: Presenting information that confirms people's existing biases or beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying contradictory information. 7. Psychological manipulation: Using techniques like emotional appeals, fear-mongering, or nostalgia to influence people's emotions and decisions. 8. Astroturfing: Creating the illusion of a grassroots movement or public support by using fake online personas, bots, or paid actors. 9. Information overload: Presenting a vast amount of information to overwhelm people and make them more susceptible to manipulation. 10. Predictive programming: Using media and entertainment to shape public opinion and prepare people for future events or policies. 11. The manipulation of social media algorithms: Using algorithms to prioritize certain types of content, such as sensational or provocative stories, to keep people engaged and influence their opinions. 12. The creation of ""echo chambers"": Using social media and online platforms to create communities that reinforce people's existing beliefs and biases, while excluding opposing viewpoints.",radio-act1v,2025-03-19T15:49:26,-4

Straight, white, abled bodied (no disability, serious mental illness or addiction issues) men are literally *not* in poverty the way women and minorities are. And by minorities I mean the disabled, gay and trans as well. *At all.* There are no laws or structures in place limiting his economic mobility!! There literally aren't.   There has not been a *true* class war since the Industrial Revolution.   The Trump administrations goals are to achieve a white and male supremacy. The rich believe in a ""meritocracy."" They believe that if you are a straight, able bodied white man, and you are poor, that's your fault. They are not consciously trying to make you poor lol. They are limiting the economy opportunities of women and minorities though! They believe they are rich because they *earned* it. And they believe that white men have the same opportunities to get ahead as they have. They don't have any goals to maintain a class of poor white men through oppression, they think there is equal opportunity in a meritocracy.   And if you are a straight, white, able bodied man? You DO have economic opportunity!! That's very fucking clear, because men hold ALL the real wealth in the world, particularly white men. And white, able bodied men are simply *not* in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are!!! Literally. The people who make minimum wage are mostly *women.* The ONLY white men that make minimum wage are men under 25. Outside of that age group, NONE of them do. 1 in 9 women are in serious poverty. 20% of blacks and Hispanics are in poverty. Only 7.7% of white people are in poverty and the *vast* majority of that 7.7% of white people are WOMEN. The minority of that 7.7% that are white men are pretty much all disabled, have serious mental illness and/or addiction or have a criminal history.   Like...the difference between a ""poor"" white man and poor women and minorities are the difference between making 50k a year with opportunities for income increases, and 30k a year with no opportunities respectively.   Let's just stop pretending that the ""poor"" are a homogeneous group of people of all sexes and colors because they fucking aren't.  Under Trumps regime, able bodied white men will have economic opportunity. It's women and minorities that won't. The programs they are taking away are the same programs that women and minorities have used to gain equality. THAT'S why they are being taken away. It's mostly single mothers on food stamps, not single white men that aren't disabled.  The rights of women, minorities and gay and trans people are literally being stripped away. Our rights *specifically.* Not the rights of the ""poor."" We are targeted specifically!!! Women are being made to provide reproductive slave labor for the state, brown people here legally are sent to Guantanamo bay. Trans people are no longer able to live as the sex they identify as!!! There is a bill right now that will limit women's right to vote. The anti-DEI shit is to keep women and minorities poor!! Not white men. This narrative that it's *actually* a class war is fucking offensive. If it was, we'd see ALL of the middle and lower classes unable to achieve economic mobility *regardless of their race, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability.* But we DON'T see that. We see straight, able bodied white men able to achieve economic mobility with little to no barriers at all! Inflation, stagnant wages, ect. are not due to policies enacted to limit economic mobility for everyone! It's due to factors determined by a free market. There *are* however new policies, executive orders, revoked executive orders, ect. That has the effect of *specifically* limiting the economy mobility of women and minorities in particular. Those actions don't affect the economic mobility of anyone outside of those groups. It's not ""class warfare"" if only women and minorities are being targeted and losing rights and economic mobility.

They fear mongered that the left was trying to destroy America and turn the kids trans in order to take away trans peoples rights. Which they literally did. They also did it because they cannot just say ""we are a white nationalist and male supremacist"" regime. They have to get support for essentially white nationalist and male supremacist policies by fear mongering. That's why immigrants are ""dangerous criminals."" Why trans people are a threat to society. It's literally to take away their legal rights.   Trans people should have the same fundamental rights as white men have always had and to be free from discrimination in the workplace, in housing, etc. to access medical care for gender dysphoria when they are 18, and to change their documents to the sex they are living as. Those are fundamental human legal rights.   Anything beyond that is a separate issue. No one has a fundamental legal right to be allowed to participate in sports. I personally support the above wholeheartedly and it makes me sick what they have done to trans people, taking away their rights. But trans women should not be in sports. The thing is, you can disagree with trans women being in sports, but not take away all their rights. But Trump acted as if it was all or nothing. Either trans people are treated as if they were born as the sex they identify with in every single domain, even when it's unrealistic and unpractical to do that (like in sports, in research) and have rights, or they simply don't have rights at all.   THAT was Trump's goal. To make people falsely believe that the left was advocating for much more than their basic fundamental rights and you couldn't have one without the other, and that's not true.

While women and minorities in the same positions met or exceeded those qualifications, because they wouldn't have even be considered otherwise! But the white men were given jobs without meeting or exceeding the listed requirements.

That she could have worked just as hard, even did every single thing he did *exactly* the same and had the same outcome? LOLLLL You're gonna tell me that his sex and race had *nothing* to do with his success? Or that it wasn't the factor that practically *determined* whether or not he'd be successful?   I aged out of the foster care system. And I can tell you, that I worked my ASS off at my 1st job. Because it was that or homelessness.

You aren't living in reality if you think that man's story isn't common, because it IS. It is common. Quite a bit of successful white men's stories involve practically falling up, or being mentored by the white men on top.

"And remember, we are discussing class oppression vs. sex and race based oppression. The argument that OP is presenting is that there is no real sex and race oppression, it's all a part of a bigger *class* oppression. Class oppression literally means there are policies and laws in place that are *intended* to limit economic mobility for ALL of the poor independent of their race and sex and disability status. That's what ""class warfare"" is. I'm saying there are *no* policies and laws that limit the economic mobility of white men. There aren't.   The question is whether white men have the ability to achieve *economic mobility* and if they don't, then what exactly are the policies and laws preventing that? And can you show that those policies and laws are intended to limit the economic mobility of poor white able bodied men and don't clearly target women and minorities?   Because again, my argument is that a poor straight, white, able bodied man is NOT experiencing class oppression. He is not poor because of class oppression, because *overall* (I know different areas present different opportunities but that is due to economic factors not intentional class warfare, we are discussing economic opportunities *within* the area he lives) he has the FULL freedom to achieve economic mobility, there are NO structures in place that are designed to not allow this, as long as he is able bodied (i.e not mentally ill, not disabled, not addicted. And I'd argue that many, many white men in Appalachia fit the category of non-able bodied due to addiction alone. Alcohol issues are rampant there).   An able bodied straight white man is not poor because he is experiencing class oppression. In fact, he is most likely not poor at all! Or if he is he is certainly not in the kind of poverty that women and minorities are, and there are ways for him to improve his situation. There are several paths to get out of poverty and none of those paths are being blocked by government policies designed to block him.   But there ARE policies and laws that have blocked poor women and minorities from having the same economic opportunities and mobility as able bodied white men. This is exactly what the anti-DEI policies are!!! To block the economic mobility of women and minorities. NOT white men. Clearly.

In other words, people who could vote, fully participate in society. That was white men and some immigrants.   What ""all men are created equal"" meant is that the belief system that some people are born superior, and created *by God* that way is not true. When there was an aristocracy and the lower classes in England and France for example, you were either born in the superior class or you weren't. And those born in the superior class ""deserved"" to be there because God caused them to be born in that status. There was *zero* class mobility. The ruling class would even practice incest because of this belief that their blood was superior. The lower classes were simply to accept their station because God put them there. There was a clear divide between the classes and that divide was set in stone. A lower class person was destined to be in the lower class. And the ruling class very much kept them there by force!   THIS situation is what created class warfare!!! NOT capitalism! In America the idea was that all men [that were not property, i.e male and not black] were created *equal* by GOD. The ""ruling"" class was no better than the lower classes. They did *not* ""deserve"" to be there! God did not ordain that. There was to be economic classes according to the laws of a free market economy, but ANYONE could achieve class mobility! You could be born to the lower class and achieve economic mobility to a higher class simply by working hard, or working smart in a free society, within a free market.   This was a *radical* idea at the time. And it made our country very wealthy! We do NOT have a ruling class that is enacting class warfare and perpetuating inequality because they need the lower classes to *stay there.* It's never been true under our constitution! There *are* ""rags to riches"" stories here. There is no ""aristocratic blood."" Capitalism isn't perfect, it needs several reforms, but ultimately it has enabled full class mobility. We allowed ANY white man to be educated! Any white man at all. Any poor person who had a good business idea could start one. What has been part of our country from the very beginning however, is that women and black people are NOT equal ""under God."" They are to be subjugated by white men.   *The constitution had to be amended to include women and black people.* And then after that we had to enact laws to guarantee the rights of women and black people! Laws that are currently being reversed by the Trump administration!!   EVERY SINGLE TIME (and I'm very serious about that) there was a policy enacted that ended up disadvantaging the poor, it was found to be *specifically* targeting black people and/or women as a backlash against them having rights and gaining equality. *Every time.* For example, poor underfunded schools almost always have something like a greater than 90% minority student body. They are in areas that continued to be segregated even after segregation ended. The decision not to fund them was to prevent black people from gaining equality (and this was admitted!) because not everyone accepted the idea that black people should access education, even after it was legal for them to do so! Women have only been allowed to be educated recently as well. Before black people, but fairly recently. Women and black people have not had rights very long. Reagan enacted policies that harmed the poor, and what was his reasoning? To target black people. Even the war on drugs was specifically to target minorities!! This was admitted! The fact that a relatively very tiny amount of poor, able bodied white men were affected was an inconsequential side effect! Besides, they believed that those poor, able bodied white men could easily better their situation in spite of those policies! And they were correct. In the 60s-90s, a poor, 18 year old uneducated white man could simply walk in a business and get hired on the spot and be the manager within 5 years if he was good at his job lol. He didn't need welfare. Welfare was needed for people who couldn't get high enough paying jobs because of discrimination based on their sex and race! It was for single mothers who were not allowed in high paying prestigious positions. Even when women could be educated, they faced sexism. Taking away these programs forces women to need to marry, which is what the Trump administration wants. They have said as much. Getting rid of programs that offset the economic effects of racism and historical oppression while they continue to better their lives prevents them from doing that. It's NOT class warfare. White men are NOT having their economic mobility limited.   If class warfare was happening then the working class would not have voted for Trump. So why did they? Because they hate women and minorities. And the working class white men also *know* that getting rid of the programs that have allowed women and minorities to achieve equality will not affect them the same way! Because they don't.   Racism and misogyny is not amplified by the upper class in order to get poor white men to vote against their interests. Trump and Elon ARE racists and misogynists!!!! OBVIOUSLY. It's not pretend, they actually do hate women and black people. Trump's misogyny was so disturbing to his former chief of staff, he called him evil. The poor white men voting for Trump are not being manipulated to be racist and misogynistic, they simply *are* because racism and misogyny is a part of the structure of our society, even at the very top  There is a kind of ""techno oligarchy"" going on with some of the billionaires, but again Musk is very, very racist and sexist and has no interest in preventing the economic mobility of white men. They do however have a strong interest in maintaining wealth and power. But that is not being done in the way it's been done in the past with *true* Marxist class warfare, where economic mobility of ALL the lower class is being prevented. Again, the idea is a ""meritocracy"" among white men, not an aristocracy. And no, giving poor men women and minorities to rule over to ""pacify them"" in their oppression is just fucking insulting. The Trump administration hates women and minorities just as much and has a strong interest in oppressing them for the sake of oppressing them. Not to distract poor white men from their oppression lol. Not everything is about white men. However, large corporations are absolutely not paying a living wage and that needs to be dealt with. Unions are needed. But as far as I know, Trump didn't make unions illegal. You'd think that would happen in a class warfare.",mellowmushroom67,2025-03-23T15:08:16,1

"Does it have to be something trivial that nobody else cares about, either?  I'm drawing a blank.  Or does it have to be a niche issue that a small group cares about passionately?  Infant circumcision comes to mind, although I think the practice ought to peter out over time.    I could imagine some right wing politician going ""they want your kid's dick to look like some weird anteater, just like in sissy ass Europe!"" or something like that.  Knowing me I'd be inclined to pick fights with that politician's supporters.  If it was someone on the left picking up the anti-circumcision line with the same ardor as the online activists I come across every once in a while, it would seem like a big fat waste of political capital to me.  (Like gun control.)  There are bigger fish to fry.  I can't think of any other examples.  Got any suggestions?  The thing is, that's not how culture war issues catch on.  There's gotta be *something* there, preexisting, for it to work.  'Articulation', to paraphrase Stuart Hall's take on Gramsci's theory of ideology.  A seed can't be planted in just any old patch of ground.    Like with the trans thing.  For a long time, transgendered people mostly flew under the radar, or got confused with transvestites.  But the prejudice was there.  Certain people would be disgusted and outraged if and when they were confronted with it.  It just didn't happen all that often, and the general gay rights conflict, (military, marriage, etc.) took up most of the attention.  Trans people started to become more visible than they had been after that started cooling down, and a lot of folks didn't like what they were seeing.  The iron was hot, but not quite hot enough.  So certain political actors turned up the heat, and that was when they were able to strike.

You realize that right???  26% of Americans say they are liberal, 32% as moderate and 33% as conservative. How is that 1 in 10?   You're arguing that to get white men to care about the oppression of women and minorities we have to lie to them and tell them that actually our oppression is not real, it's all a distraction from THEIR oppression, which is the same as our oppression. And that's fucking BULLSHIT. We shouldn't have to do that. It should be enough that women and minorities specifically have, and currently are losing our rights on the basis of our sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability status. Because of racism and misogyny. That should be enough.   That being said, Trump's policies ARE horrible for the economy. The stock market is crashing. We are headed for a Great Depression. That should be enough as well!! None of the above are happening because of a true class warfare, but it shouldn't have to be about that for people to care!! Wages being stagnant while inflation soars is also not because of intentional ""class warfare,"" not *really.* However, wages STILL need to be increased regardless of that. But there is no intention to keep white men poor. They believe that minimum wage *shouldn't* be a living wage. They see it like a stepping stone. The problem is because of sex and race based discrimination, women and minorities have a harder time getting raises. And like I said, white men aren't in poverty because of minimum wage being so low. But women and minorities are! The statistics on who makes minimum wage show it's almost all women and minorities. The ONLY white men who make minimum wage are under 25, they aren't living on minimum wage like women and minorities are. They achieve economic mobility eventually. Economic mobility that Trump is not trying to prevent them from achieving! He is however, intentionally and clearly trying to prevent the economy mobility of *specific groups.* And whether or not minimum wage affects white men or not should not be a consideration *at all* for people who support a minimum wage increase!!   The reality is there are no laws or policies being put in place specifically to limit the economic mobility of straight, white, able bodied men. They don't exist. Trump is not enacting any policies that make it impossible or difficult for them to achieve economic mobility. Trump is enacting policies that are specifically limiting the economic mobility of women and minorities. That's what the ""anti-DEI shit is.   Women and minorities suffer poverty not because of ""capitalism"" and ""class warfare"" but because of discrimination on the basis of our sex, race, gender identity, sexual orientation and disability status. Trump is taking away the support systems that enabled us to start achieving equality. Not to keep the poor, poor but to keep women and minorities poor.
