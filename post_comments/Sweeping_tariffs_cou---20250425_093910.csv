Construction spending on manufacturing [tripled](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TLMFGCONS) under Biden.  It is declining under Trump.,gradientz,2025-04-25T09:42:56,14
Almost like letting the guy who bankrupted 6 casinos run our country like a fucking HOI4 campaign is a bad idea.,Kindredgos,2025-04-25T09:50:57,5
"**From the article:**  US manufacturing in the years following the covid pandemic has been booming—or at least the groundwork for such a boom is getting built. Until the most recent few months, spending on the construction of factories[ had been soaring](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PRMFGCONS). New facilities to build batteries, solar cells, semiconductors, electric motors, and other new technologies are springing up all around the country—or were[ until very recently](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/21/1115511/canceled-climate-tech-projects/).  But there are already indications that the prospect of widespread tariffs could be [harming this boom. ](https://cepr.net/publications/trump-derails-manufacturing-boom/)For one thing, the specifics—how large, how long, and on what countries—seem to be constantly shifting. And that’s a big part of the problem: For manufacturers and investors, uncertainty is the killer of plans for expansion, new factories, and even the R&D that feeds into new products.  It’s that uncertainty, above all else, that could derail a reindustrialization still in the early stages for much of the country. If the Trump administration’s tariffs slow or even reverse such progress, the impact on the country’s economic and technological future could be devastating.",techreview,2025-04-25T09:39:24,4
"Manufacturing was going to slowly return to the US, Mexico and Canada organically.  Trump just wreaked all this.",TintedApostle,2025-04-25T09:43:37,4
"Yep. It's just like border security.   Trump and the GOP cried about how bad border security was, and then Trump tanked the border security bill under Biden.   They've been screeching about how manufacturing needs to come back to the US. So now they're going to make that worse, too.   Because if border security is better. And it becomes apparent more manufacturing is coming back to the US, then what do they have to run on?",raistlin65,2025-04-25T10:20:59,4
"Tariffs do not create a boom in domestic manufacturing, and instead just apply a massive tax on the American people, slow the economy, and make it more difficult to produce products domestically. This is Smoot-Hawley part 2, only much stupider since instead of being at least passed as a well-documented set of tariffs, with appropriations for implementing them and collecting the proceeds, it’s a random “spin the wheel of tariffs” approach being done via social media and vague, often conflicting, announcements, by one guy, who has no coherent plan, who changes his mind weekly, and has somehow been granted the power to fuck shit up based upon absolute lies told to justify a state of “emergency”. Equally at blame is a quiescent Congress, full of spineless dolts, who lapped up these lies and abdicated their responsibilities and obligations under the US Constitution to permit this jackass to cause all this damage.",Palimpsest0,2025-04-25T10:28:57,2
"Wow I miss the steady, sensible leadership of President Biden.",Choice_Cup_3624,2025-04-25T10:32:39,2
"But he's a *business*man. He will run the country like a *business*.  Cutting corners around regulations, shafting the public, and profiteering like a bandit. And asset-stripping. Anything of value will vanish from the shelves, walls and vaults, never to be seen again.  What's not to like?",AINonsense,2025-04-25T09:58:27,1
"I love the criticism that he wasn't really running the show. At least it was a show, this is a fucking circus. Apparently MAGA idiots think advisors are only there to be sycophants, I think it was a good thing Biden left competent advisors to their jobs with little interference.",moldivore,2025-04-26T00:23:26,1
