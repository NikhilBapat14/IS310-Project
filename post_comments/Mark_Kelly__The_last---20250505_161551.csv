The entire oath is only 35 words. Trump took it twice.  I guess he was too obsessed about the size of his...compared to Obama's.,BrupieD,2025-05-05T17:02:24,39

Senator Kelly is spot on because he knew that Trump failed it twice.,AceCombat9519,2025-05-05T21:14:33,4
"For what it's worth, Donald Trump is a known oath breaker and law breaker.  He doesn't actually face any consequences for breaking oaths or laws, so when he says things like this, in his head it is pretty sure noone could touch him even if he murdered a mother in front of her children on 5th avenue.  The supreme court put him above the law.  What is the constitution to him when he can just murder anyone who tries to hold him accountable?  There are no consequences for the unitary executive who is above the law.  This is exactly what the constitution was supposed to prevent.",JDogg126,2025-05-06T13:08:30,5

Here’s one time he’s not lying. Anyone who can be fooled by a first grade photo shop really doesn’t know stuff. The look on his face tells you he really can’t remember,AlaskaRecluse,2025-05-06T16:59:10,1
