"Didn’t realize parents’ religious views have anything to do with public education 🤔. Here’s the simple truth. Want to send your kids to learn the “Christian” way, send them to a religious school. Keep your religious beliefs out of our public schools. It’s not silencing religion, it’s teaching curriculum that is appropriate to the institution. Public education means everyone benefits. Private/Religious education, a select group gets benefits. Keep your religious views out of public school classrooms.",TonightEducational51,2025-04-24T13:21:31,312

"[Alito] “the book still “subtly” tells kids that same-sex marriage “is a good thing.””  No. It tells them that it’s a thing they might see in life, like a woman voting. A normal thing that has no consequence on them whatsoever, or any other persons other than those directly implicated, and therefore is neither good nor bad. There is literally nothing bad about two people irrelevant to you getting married. YOU have to make about YOU, about your personal beliefs despite there being no impacts on you or your parenting. YOU have to make it about something other than the law and the people directly implicated. And that would be some logic and moral contorting right there!",theEndIsNigh_2025,2025-04-24T16:08:29,87

"In Alito's dissent for Obergefell v. Hodges:  ""Invoking Glucksberg, in which the Court stated the Due Process Clause protects only rights and liberties that are ""deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition"", Alito claimed any ""right"" to same-sex marriage would not meet this definition; he chided the justices in the majority for going against judicial precedent and long-held tradition.""  The issue here with Alito's interpretation, as noted by many others, is that what is ""deeply rooted in the Nation's history"" is incredibly up to interpretation. Prior to the 1950's, interracial marriage was uncommon in the country. Does this then mean that interracial marriage isn't a protected right and the decision reached in Loving v. Virginia was wrong? What about Zablocki v. Redhail or Turner v. Safely? They were also rulings on marriage that one could argue didn't have ""deeply roots in the Nation's history"". Are those decisions wrong as well?   As far as judicial precedent, marriage itself has been consistently upheld as a protected right under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, as seen by the court cases I just mentioned. SCOTUS has consistently upheld the constitutional right to interracial marriage and has struck down laws prohibiting marriage based on past actions such as child support and imprisonment, all of which set a heavy precedent that marriage is a protected right under the Due Process Clause. Yet suddenly, when the marriage is between two individuals of the same sex, that's when the majority is going ""against judicial precedent"".  Simply put, this is just one example where you could argue that Alito has tried to twist the law the fit what he believes it should be and not what is actually Constitutional.",VegaMain,2025-04-25T19:57:13,2
Full Agree.  Parents should not get to opt-out their kids from anything at public schools.  Public school curriculum should be set by the teachers and professionals the state pays to do that.  Parents can already teach their kids whatever they want.  At home.,FollowsHotties,2025-04-24T14:03:04,95

It’s the parents choice where their children go, and children need to be registered at schools even in public schools, especially if the city you live in has multiple public schools.  And that’s where the whole school choice argument comes in where it’s this Republican red herring that parents should have more access to school choice, but in reality what that means is Republicans want federal tax dollars to pay to fund these private and charter schools.

Bearing false witness is a sin, after all.  The Old and New Testaments also have multiple passages saying you should follow the law, because if God didn’t want them to exist then they wouldn’t.

You are correct. Unless schools are teaching about religions in an informative way. Ex: teaching about the reformation or islamic golden age etc. And understanding the religions views are important to understand what happened. Or its literally a religions class teaching about various world religions. Then any sort of religious belief should not be taught in schools.   Creationism is a religious belief.
