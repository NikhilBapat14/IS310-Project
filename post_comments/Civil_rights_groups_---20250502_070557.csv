Isn't that also most of the NYPD?,Kuroboom,2025-05-02T07:11:50,4
"vast majority of people in this database have nothing to do with anything violent and probably nothing to do with gangs. NYPD has admitted that 10,000 people in the database have no prior felonies, and 9,000 have never even been suspected of gun violence, even though NYPD claims the whole point of the database is about shootings. Many people are stopped and frisked constantly because they’re in the database, they’re facing police harassment on a daily basis, constantly being watched, etc. it’s not right.",dcm341,2025-05-02T11:38:20,1
"So,  Black community leaders constantly and loudly lament that one of the biggest struggles/hurdles they   face is gangs/gang-membership and the increased levels of crime associated with gang activity....but it's racist if anyone else tries to document it or insinuate that the Black community has a gang problem?  🤣  They probably think you have a gang problem because you keep telling them that you do.",--John_Yaya--,2025-05-02T07:15:22,-4
Statistics do not lie,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-02T07:25:00,-2
"This is disingenuous. The issue with secret databases is that people may be on them without their knowledge, and it could be wrong. The UK has had similar issues with the a similar system and it’s the same issues wherever they’re used.  You have younger people being added to them without their knowledge, based on who knows what, and they have no idea they were even profiled or why. Some people may be added to it maliciously, or genuinely by mistake. Maybe they have family or some connection to someone affiliated, maybe they don’t even necessarily know themselves, or maybe they’re connected through some other casual connection. So sometimes it’s like a database of presumed guilt by association.  If social mobility exists then this acts like a straight jacket.  So if that happens, how would they even know? And the answer is they usually don’t even know, but they’ll be scrutinised and policed as if it’s true.  For example, you’re added to the database either my mistake, mistaken identity, misinterpreted signs, or even maliciously by someone that knows someone that has a grudge. So you have a dispute with someone that is connected to law enforcement, they look into the persons background and then add them to the gang database as a method of harassment, essentially, because they will start to notice they are being scrutinised and people are now looking for reasons to justify arresting them. So their life will suddenly become slightly more filled with friction.  Police also leak information, and so the fact that they’re marked won’t be known to them, but it will be to other people, so you may even have other random people/informants then start stalking and surveilling them, under the genuine belief they’re going to find something, and are expecting to collect payments for information. Some vigilantes may then even feel empowered to take extreme steps to find information about them and maybe start trying to bait them into strange situations, they may start to influence people around them and ask questions that lead others to assume something bad is going on.  Because this information leaks, rival gangs may then also get this information so it can then create a genuinely dangerous situation as they may then genuinely believe this person is a fair target and a rival, when there aren’t.  They then do “normal” things like buy certain DIY tools, chemicals, knives etc. The police or informants then start requesting more data about them, surveilling them as from their perspective of “dangerous criminal gang member acquiring weapons and preparing violent assault” etc. Maybe they have a domestic dispute or an argument, this is then escalates m into “dangerous criminal thug danger to life” etc.  If they have money or expensive items, it may by assumed to be the proceeds of crime and interpreted as further evidence of “criminality”, and so again you might then have informants and others trying to “prove” this and take a cut.  So if it turns out that this labelling was wrong, then all this additional policing and scrutiny was unjustified, the person was subjected to surveillance and monitoring and legal harassment that would usually be considered an abuse of a persons rights.  In some cases they’re essentially slandered covertly because if this information leaks and there are informants leaking information that turns out to be false or misleading, then this may affect that persons life. Some background checks and investigations may flag this, and so they may miss opportunities because of it.  So it can be abused in lots of ways that further entrenches social divides because if you’re subjected to this then you’re going to be resentful and distrusting. They may then start to become evasive. This may affect their mental health etc.",SomeYak5426,2025-05-02T08:36:08,5
"You don't see anything wrong with putting people with no history of being in a gang into a database, even if they're as young as 11 years old, and it's also unconstitutional?",kingofcrosses,2025-05-02T07:37:50,6
"That's begging the question.  The problem is 99% of the database is all from two racial groups, and people are being put on arbitrarily without any indication of criminal activity.  If the database was based on things people actually did, and included all the other ethnic groups, races, and associations that make up organized crime, I doubt there be would such outrage.",periphery72271,2025-05-02T07:55:01,4
Look up the Kerner Commission Report. That was a genuine attempt by the government to diagnose a problem and deal with it. The NYPD are not operating in good faith.,PsychologicalBad4586,2025-05-02T08:40:07,2
But people can lie with statistics.,periphery72271,2025-05-02T07:52:05,4
"I will say in the other persons defense it isnt being presented that way. Its simply list bad. Information needs a revolution on the way it is presented. I get that people could easily just read the article, but there is so much pressure on everything else in life now that sometimes that just isnt feasible. Even the way certain things are formatted to be displayed on phones can be a problem. Slightly longer headlines with just a tiny bit more of information would do wonders.",[deleted],2025-05-02T08:26:53,2
"FBI and criminal statistics tend to not lie   When all statistics are aligned, it tends to be valid ",Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-02T08:35:52,0
">I get that people could easily just read the article, but there is so much pressure on everything else in life now that sometimes that just isnt feasible.  Headlines need to be presented better yes. However, I think that if people find it feasible to write a paragraph sharing their opinion of an article, then they should find it feasible to at least know what the article says.",ThisOneFuqs,2025-05-02T08:47:09,3
"Statistics, no matter what the source, state specific things. They point to nothing.  People use statistics to try to validate their theories or opinions, when in reality, they are just a snapshot of a certain set of facts. There could be a lot of other factors that should be considered before any conclusions are made.  A statistic could be stating that 50% of US citizens are murderers.  It would also happen to be true. A fact.   What isn't stated in this imaginary scenario is that there only happened to be two people in the study, both convicts, and one was, in fact, a murderer.  If you went to a different prison and pulled two inmates, both US citizens, one a murderer and one not, you could formulate a trend. Every time you line up two inmates, one is a murderer. Now you have aligned statistics, multiple studies, even different persons tabulating, and you still get the same statistic- 50% are murderers.  Without the missing context, even with true statistics in that circumstance, the conclusion someone might be led to make would be absolutely faulty.  True statistics can easily be used to tell a lie.  That is embarrassingly common in this arena.",periphery72271,2025-05-02T08:53:20,3
You are implying all criminal statistics are incorrect?,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-02T08:56:39,0
"Not at all, however, if you really want to get into the weeds on the particular statistics you're pointing to, I can show you how they're used to make false conclusions and how the collection of them can be not indicative of the real situation.  As I said. Statistics are usually tabulated correctly. The numbers are what was counted. Who counted them, why, what was counted, when, etc. is where the context is, and people many times don't care to look that deeply.",periphery72271,2025-05-02T08:59:48,3
