"> Prominent defense hawks on Capitol Hill on Friday slammed President Trump’s 2026 budget request as inadequate, amid growing threats from China, Russia and other adversaries.  The MAGAstration is responsible for the growing threats and now they want us taxpayers to pay for it.",nwgdad,2025-05-02T20:54:28,12

"This whole idea of a ""Trump Budget"" (or a ""Biden Budget"", or an ""Obama Budget"", or a ""Bush Budget"") is absurd.  The Legislative Branch has the power of the purse!  If enough Congress-critters think the Budget appropriates too much to Defense, well don't vote for the damn thing!  If it doesn't get enough votes, Trump doesn't even have a chance to sign (or veto) it!",Monkey1Fball,2025-05-02T21:54:12,5

"> “For the defense budget, OMB has requested a fifth year straight of Biden administration funding, leaving military spending flat, which is a cut in real terms,” Wicker said in a statement.  Hmm, and how long has minimum wage been “flat”? Freaking joke.",Lynda73,2025-05-02T22:59:08,3
