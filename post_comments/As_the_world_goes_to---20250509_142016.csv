It is almost the worst part of this. That trump gets to enjoy this shit. And his maga base gets to think they are winning as their Medicaid is cut and their kids die of measles.,WithMaliceTowardFew,2025-05-09T15:44:46,4

I am very glad to be Canadian these days. It seems to me that there is a basic failure in America where it comes to popular resistance. Wealth is worshipped in the US to such an extent that even when you are being oppressed by wealth you can’t effectively oppose it. Now it may have something to do with the absence of what used to be called the free press but I just don’t see resistance to Trumpism outside of whining on Reddit.,Crowmakeswing,2025-05-09T15:14:27,3

"Do you read any of the articles posted on here? Every day there is a protest, or someone denouncing his administration, or politically opposing him / trying to prevent his actions. There is only so much the average person can do though.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T15:37:14,5
Well the average person in Europe would do more; they would be out in the streets! You people with your guns up the whazoo can’t manage peaceful protest because someone will start shooting so everyone stays home instead.,Crowmakeswing,2025-05-09T15:41:19,0
"> There is only so much the average person can do though  lol, if even 5% of the country could turn out to protest at the same time this could probably be turned around, but you’ll never get that many because the average American is little more aware of its surroundings than a cow or sheep. ",Advanced-Extreme-186,2025-05-09T18:35:30,-2
"""Well the average person in Europe would do more; ""  No they wouldn't. When was the last time there were wide spread protests in Europe? Brexit? That didn't resemble anything that hasn't happened in the U.S. in recent years. You literally don't read U.S. news but want to talk about what is going on here. Protests haven't stopped since he's been in office, and violence hasn't been an issue at them.  Police brutality protests might turn into riots but that is a whole different subject and there hasn't even been any recently.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T15:46:26,2

"I don't like the French comparison.   - The French discuss politics all the time versus the US thinking it's not ever for polite conversation.   - We protest, but the French government has actually feared for its existence on multiple occasions during periods of public outcry.   - Also more than 1/3rd of the population lives in the Paris region—imagine 1/3rd of the US living in  NOVA/Maryland/DC where a protest could be less than 90 min away.",Ok_Value5495,2025-05-09T19:17:11,1
"""Your organizing won’t help in our present trouble""  Informing people and trying to spread awareness with midterms coming up is literally all the average person can do in the short term, but you calling out people on Reddit who are actually doing something is helping a lot more I'm sure.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-09T19:10:32,0
