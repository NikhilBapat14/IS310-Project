"""some immigrants"" but where do you draw the line? None of my grandparents were born in the US - will that be a problem or is it ok because I'm white?",[deleted],2025-05-09T16:19:02,13
"Oh boy this one’s a big one. Will the Supreme Court limit the lower courts, and reduce the judiciary’s overall power",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-09T16:15:00,8
"Like how would they even expect someone to prove they are a citizen if a birth certificate no longer means anything? And are the parents going to have to prove *their* parents are citizens? What’s next, an official family tree? Blood test? Do you look and “sound white”? Like just the logistics alone are a nightmare, and you add time to the equation? Surely to god they won’t. But then:  >The case also marks a rare argument over an emergency appeal. In rare and high-profile cases like Texas’ pre-Dobbs abortion ban, Covid-19 restrictions and air pollution standards, the justices held special argument sessions before they issue their decision.   >While birthright citizenship falls into this category, the justices just recently passed up an opportunity to review the use of nationwide injunctions on the merits docket, where the justices wouldn’t have been rushed to issue a ruling.  Welp, I hope first order of business after they issue that order is to disrobe Clarence Thomas since he’s clearly “not from …Europe (aka Old America)”?",Lynda73,2025-05-09T17:15:58,6

"Per the article, at least, that could be the case.     ""Identification documents for all children — even those of citizens — would become suspect, as a U.S. birth certificate would no longer serve as definitive proof of citizenship.     “If implemented, the Order will undercut the social fabric and cohesion of communities by creating a permanent underclass of people with unequal rights,” the officials wrote to the court.""",StatusCount7032,2025-05-09T17:03:21,5
They’re already a joke. If a 9-0 decision on Garcia isn’t doing anything they have no power. The goalpost hasn’t moved. MAGA has crossed the line. Will judges keep making up goalposts to look like they have power or will they do anything to actually keep their power? That’s the only question I’m interested in,jgoble15,2025-05-10T14:41:54,1
