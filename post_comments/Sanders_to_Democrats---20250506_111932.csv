"They should pass a huge domestic manufacturing and jobs bill aimed at lower and middle income households that has massive outlays for clean energy, expanding high speed rail, investing in new tech and training, providing a lot of jobs that don't require higher education, support unions, expand health care access, and are all paid well while building up local economies...you know, like they did 3 years ago.",atreeismissing,2025-05-06T13:55:39,2

">‘Oh, well, you know, Trump is a terrible guy,’” Sanders continued, paraphrasing arguments critics sometimes use against Trump.  >“Fine. You know, the majority of American people understand that. What’s your alternative? Why did Trump get elected?""  So the majority of people understand Trump is terrible but still elected him.  Alright. Brilliant analysis.",Turok7777,2025-05-06T18:22:52,1

"They're lost-in-the-sauce of politicking from days of yor... you know, before it led to tour current, actual, fascism.   Still wild to me to see the difference of answering a coup attempt in SK and The U.S.",watcherofworld,2025-05-06T14:56:04,2

"According to Redditors, that simply wasn't enough which is why Americans decided to opt for the tried and true strategy of voting for the inept ""businessman"" who tanked the economy 8 years ago.  we r bery smawrt",Turok7777,2025-05-06T18:27:57,1
"Cause even though Trumps polling is underwater, he is still far more popular than congressional democrats. Dems have to be something more than “not Trump” if they want to get back in the game.",Possible-Mango-7603,2025-05-06T19:33:17,6
"Oh.. Really? Didn't know that, but honestly,  not really surprised either..! Thanks for letting me know!    Shame though, then there are even less intact donkeys than I initially thought...Fuck..",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-05-06T11:39:16,5
Thank god. Don’t think I could stand having him involved in my party. It’s bad enough we gave him all that help to try and win the top spot on our ticket.  Twice.,Thumbkeeper,2025-05-06T18:24:06,-6
"Being ""not Trump"" means not tanking the economy, not getting into petty squabbles with allied countries, not rolling back protections for minorities and disadvantaged groups, not giving millionaires and billionaires tax breaks, and not focusing on things that don't matter.  If that's not enough for Americans, then the country is literally screwed.",Turok7777,2025-05-06T19:37:41,-1
There are two independents in the U.S. senate who usually tie their elections to the democrats. There is Sanders who is among the most progressive senators and Angus King (Maine) who is one of the most moderate senators in the chamber.  Because they caucus with the democrats they are recognized as independents but usually lumped together in counters such as who controls the chamber.,Onlysomewhatserious,2025-05-06T16:36:34,3
"Maybe but that thinking won’t help the Democrats. They need to offer a vision for moving the country forward that resonates with people. They’ve lost key constituents over the last decade or so and they need to recommit to addressing this people concerns. The Trumps a Nazi Schtick is tired as hell. It just doesn’t land anymore. They had better figure it out and quick or we’ll be looking at a President Vance or Rubio in 2028 and probably beyond. I have no clue what they are fucking doing but whatever it is, it is not working at all. Not even a little tiny bit.",Possible-Mango-7603,2025-05-06T19:47:30,5
Sanders has been using that to blackmail the democrats for decades.  All of this is his doing.,Thumbkeeper,2025-05-06T18:24:51,-5
