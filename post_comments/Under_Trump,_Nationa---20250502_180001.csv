"As a scientist - WTF.  Universities, media, scientists, a particular ethnic group, the judiciary, LGBTQIA, and female equality.   At a secondary level, education, health, food and housing security, national parks - all things that exhaust people and removes the chance for recreation/getting clear head space to think about the situation (not to mention the financial benefits for the super wealthy).  I'm sure I've heard about this behaviour before...  ( What did I miss? Because that list MUST be missing things. )  Edit: of i forgot about the establishment of ""elite"" schools.  Oh, and the books. Can't forget the banning of books.

All this specific targeting of science its definitely the heritage Foundation behind it. They have had a long history of wanting to undermine science because they feel it undermines religion. Nothing good will come out of this..,sedatedlife,2025-05-02T18:23:27,34

"11. *Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts*  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested.

These assholes are at war with truth. They loathe truth. They imagine themselves as having stumbled out of Plato's cave and seen the naked truth in the light of day because everything they believe is mocked and rightly derided because it's a rich mix of nonsense and awfulness.

I mean even after ww2 both the soviets and allied allowed a decent amount of the defeated scientists to return to work in Germany (Note some of these were war criminals like the guy who ran IG auswitz though that was after recruiting the best they could find for their own programs). So yeah destroying all science and research is indeed more than was done following ww2 (at least in the 5 or so years following the war as immediately after science and research was shut down more because the entire German and Japanese economies were destroyed so basic institutions and food were priorities).,cjh42,2025-05-02T21:22:18,4
