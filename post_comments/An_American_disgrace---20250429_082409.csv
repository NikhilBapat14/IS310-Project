"If only the first term showed us exactly what we'd be getting.. OH WAIT!  4 more years of an insecure, ignorant base trying to hold on to an idea of ethnic superiority and religious fanaticism.",EndsWithJusSayin,2025-04-29T08:28:25,167
"It’s incredible to me because he’s not even doing the things he promised to do, he’s creating the illusion he is. It’s smoke in mirrors and his supporters are eating it up.  He hasn’t decreased the size of government, the scope has steadily increased as he looks to bring federal power down on the states as well as other branches.  He hasn’t decreased federal spending, he just unveiled the trillion dollar defense budget Hegseth has been bragging about.  No instant end to the Ukraine war and there’s been no consistent message or strategy.  The tariffs can’t even deliver on what he said they would, because beyond the bad economics behind it, there’s no consistency in execution creating a great deal of uncertainty.  It just goes on down the line. So what’s he done? Be a jerk to other world leaders and enact a widespread transphobic agenda? This administration is a failure and a joke, an oppressive and dishonorable one at that.",jediporcupine,2025-04-29T08:31:49,77
"Part 1 of 4:  by **Thomas Cangelosi a retired teacher**  >President Donald Trump is a national embarrassment and an American disgrace. Fueled by his massive ego, he’s driving roughshod over the American government, the American taxpayers, and the world at large.  >After Trump declared that “Our country’s going to be based on merit…,” he appointed blind loyalists who pledged to destroy the departments or agencies they’d head. Their incompetence and inexperience promptly displayed itself when they invited a reporter to a chat discussing obviously classified information of an impending military attack. Trump, however, downplayed a monumental security error as a “glitch.”  In other words, he was never interested in merit, only obeisance —the better to rule with, my dear.  >To bulldoze the rest of the government, Trump appointed Elon Musk to bypass the ineffectual cabinet and indiscriminately fire thousands of federal employees.  Consequently, government services to taxpayers have been compromised, government oversight has been blinded, and Trump’s cabinet has all the power of a hand puppet.  In short, Trump has eliminated all government accountability for his planned, lawless reign.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-29T08:24:58,17
