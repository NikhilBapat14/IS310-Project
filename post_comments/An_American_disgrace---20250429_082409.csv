"It‚Äôs incredible to me because he‚Äôs not even doing the things he promised to do, he‚Äôs creating the illusion he is. It‚Äôs smoke in mirrors and his supporters are eating it up.  He hasn‚Äôt decreased the size of government, the scope has steadily increased as he looks to bring federal power down on the states as well as other branches.  He hasn‚Äôt decreased federal spending, he just unveiled the trillion dollar defense budget Hegseth has been bragging about.  No instant end to the Ukraine war and there‚Äôs been no consistent message or strategy.  The tariffs can‚Äôt even deliver on what he said they would, because beyond the bad economics behind it, there‚Äôs no consistency in execution creating a great deal of uncertainty.  It just goes on down the line. So what‚Äôs he done? Be a jerk to other world leaders and enact a widespread transphobic agenda?

Their incompetence and inexperience promptly displayed itself when they invited a reporter to a chat discussing obviously classified information of an impending military attack. Trump, however, downplayed a monumental security error as a ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù¬† In other words, he was never interested in merit, only obeisance ‚Äîthe better to rule with, my dear.  >To bulldoze the rest of the government, Trump appointed Elon Musk to bypass the ineffectual cabinet and indiscriminately fire thousands of federal employees.¬† Consequently, government services to taxpayers have been compromised, government oversight has been blinded, and Trump‚Äôs cabinet has all the power of a hand puppet. ¬†In short, Trump has eliminated all government accountability for his planned, lawless reign.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-29T08:24:58,17
