"Some folks can't handle change, especially when it jeopardizes their status quo and ends feckless policies that could only serve to strengthen the enemy.",egtsgt,2025-04-22T08:35:53,-1
If it wasnâ€™t obvious 10 years ago.. I just hope this entrenched establishment bullshit gets rooted out. So sick of these demons clinging to power,MiceTonerAccount,2025-04-22T09:22:38,0
"You'd think by now the better half of this country wouldn't fall for such blatant, obvious propaganda hit-pieces. We expect Pedocrats to auto-follow the media's narrative, but conservatives? Maybe it's just Reddit but any time the New York Times says anything, our first reaction should not be ""I believe them."" At this point, if they said two and two was four, I'd reach for a calculator. When they bullied Trump into outing Gaetz, it was their ""So then god can bleed"" moment, then tried the same tact with Musk. A lot of innocent drivers were victimized in the process - but it failed. Now they're aiming at Hegseth again, it will fail. Next month they'll go after someone else, and people here, with ""conservative"" flair, will fall for it.",Right_Archivist,2025-04-22T08:46:21,-8
"This is literally trying to refry the signal thingy from a month ago, where no classified information was released at all...nothingburger.",Chikaze,2025-04-22T11:35:53,-5
Exactly.  And it's the same playbook they used last time Trump was in office.,DrStevenPoop,2025-04-22T09:12:13,1
They didn't get as much mileage out of their MS-13 martyr as they thought they would. Now they're falling back to the last 'big thing' until something new comes along.,raccoonbandit13,2025-04-22T12:21:38,-2
