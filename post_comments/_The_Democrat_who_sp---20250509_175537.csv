"It's very amazing to me how they can jump right on a nobody, arrest and charge in a heart beat. But when it comes to the upper crust individuals it's alway a years long investigation that just disappears under the rug.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-09T18:15:29,231
She would have faced a longer sentence walking inside the the Capitol Building on a January day.,vampirepomeranian,2025-05-10T09:26:01,9
Good and deserved that the nitwit was arrested but 20 years seems a bit excessive for spitting.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-09T19:14:56,66
"I seriously doubt she'll get any jail time at all.....but nothing would make me happier than for her to have to sit in a cell for a year or two to ponder what an arrogant, self-righteous little monster she is.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-09T19:12:16,20
"These same progressive liberals would say it would be ""violence"" if a conservative would've done that to them. 100% they would've said that. But it just shows that Littles don't care about the rule of law. There's so many examples of them breaking the law or supporting people who break the law. But then they have the nerve to scream at us about it lol",BossJackson222,2025-05-09T18:21:46,38

"I mean it helps if the crime is in broad daylight on film. Even still, the upper crust has very good lawyers that can delay and negotiate.",SpaceToaster,2025-05-09T19:41:03,37
"It's just the upper bounds of the legal punishment for assault.   It will be pled down, but that initial kind of sticker shock of ""but I just spat at him!"" ""Well yeah, that's what assault is, and that's the punishment you can get for assault. Do you feel a little stupid and in danger of some serious consequences now?"" will hopefully deter future idiocy if not from everyone then at least from her.",TheIncredibleHork,2025-05-10T04:39:11,14
"Up to 20, if they push the enhanced penalty. Might plead it down to a couple years under simple battery.",LKincheloe,2025-05-09T23:27:07,2
