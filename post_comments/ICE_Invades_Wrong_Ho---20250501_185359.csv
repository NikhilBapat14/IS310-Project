"Cops of all sorts need to carry individual insurance against tort claims that they violated civil rights of defendants. Cops who are within the normal range will have their insurance paid by their employer (up to $60k/year, let me imagine), but cops who cost $70k/year to insure will have to pay the $10k difference themselves, or convince a local department they're worth an extra $10k/year in insurance costs. The more a cop costs to insure, the less likely local departments are to hire him, and where (as in Chicago) you end up with 10% of cops costing the city 90% of settlements running into the millions and millions of dollars, those cops become uninsurable when they have to pay their own insurance fees above X amount. Maybe the city pays for outliers who cost 30% more than average to insure (and gives cash bonuses to those who cost 30% less than average), but at a certain point, an individual cop becomes uninsurable and can't fall back on the city's tort fund (which can be raised without a taxpayer vote) to pay for his misdeeds.  (Generally tort funds by governmental bodies are levied at the rate they need to be levied to pay outstanding tort costs. They're not voted on, they're a levy the city pays for misdeeds by its cops or schools or whomever, that is required by law to meet those tort costs and nobody is allowed to vote to cap them. Cities have to pay what they have to pay in tort settlements, and it's a line item on your property taxes that you have literally no say over. Require cops to carry insurance when they go beyond a certain tort cap, and bad cops would be quitting left and right because they couldn't afford to pay for their own insurance.)",AliMcGraw,2025-05-02T01:55:18,12

"Nazis were not really any more competent. There are a few effects of historical revisionism that happened to essentially whitewash Nazis as being way more competent than they actually were.   Off the top of my head the main things that occurred are as follows:  1. Most of our historical sources used to document the history of Nazis were written by Nazis about themselves or on behalf of themselves. And they lied. A lot.  2. The Russian military apparatus was loosing a crap ton of people constantly, and so it was in their benefit to pretend that Nazis were monstrously skilled at war, but in reality the casualties on the Russian side was largely due to their doctrines, as while casualties were heavy in every other theater, they were not even remotely comparable.  3. The US wanted the few actually competent Nazi scientists that existed, mostly in rocketry, to defect, and so we did a whole thing to reclaim and redefine them as inherently good people being forced to work for an insanely competent bad person they could not escape. In reality though, most Nazi science was along the lines of ""Jewish head shape proves they serve Satan"" and so was not really useful. There is a persistent myth that they actually learned a lot from their torture, but their scientific method was SO BAD that nothing is really usable. They were just torturing for fun while cosplaying as mad scientists.  4. When the books written by Nazis are translated into other languages, the translators often ""fix"" the prose in the book to make it more understandable. The problem is that writings are often insane ramblings similar to what you would see on conspiracy subreddits. This is especially true of Hitler.  5. The pro-fascism right wing in the US used the exact same mechanisms they used to do post-civil war propaganda for the south on the Nazis. They tossed out the ""bad"" part, namely slavery in the south and the mass murder in WW2, and leaned in HARD on the *aesthetic*. For the south it was the whole aristocratic southern charm, and with Nazis they did their best to make them appear to be genteel and cultured and intelligent. In both cases it is all just movies, posters and books. The actual people were largely thugs who liked to torture, rape and murder while robbing everyone blind. They were not a cultured upper class, they were con artists, slumlords and bandits who got to much power.  There is actually a bunch of historical work that has been done on this recently. And on the stuff from the civil war. In short, the Southern rebellion never really died in the US. It just moved from being an open war of aggression into an information war, with a bunch of hyper racist organizations that *still exist to this day* doing a massive amount of work trying to convince people that racists are ""cool"" and ""smart"" and ""powerful.""  The reality is a lot more mundane. Turns out that people are easily manipulated by confidence men, and once those con artists get into power they tend to be really bad at actually governing. But it does not matter, because they *say* they are the best at it. (Trump: ""Nobody knows more about taxes than me, maybe in the history of the world."")",Caelinus,2025-05-02T00:36:51,18

When the German army occupied countries where the state still existed, there was still rampant oppression and many people, especially Jews, did die, but they weren't subjected to the sorts of inhumane torture and abuse that we associated with the Holocaust. But when the Nazis moved into areas where the rule of law no longer existed, it was so easy for men to become monsters that didn't even need instruction.

Maybe a handful of SA stormtroopers get themselves shot when terrorising Jewish businesses or breaking up a socialist rally or whatever, then they get held up as martyrs and the Nazis lean into the idea that [insert group here] are violent and need to be driven out, rounded up, or banned.

"Oh, that's because the Police can steal from you during *any* arrest or detainment, legally, and you have to then argue that your cash and objects were not in fact committing a crime to get it returned.  People get pulled over with cash on them intended to be used to buy things like a car, equipment, etc, and the police can say they suspect it is intended to be used to buy drugs to confiscate all of it. Doesn't matter the reason for why they stopped you, you don't even need to be arrested or detained for them to do it. It's called Civil Forfeiture, and is constantly abused by corrupt police. And they literally charge your property with the crime they suspect, not you yourself, because apparently inanimate objects can actually commit crimes when the police feel like it.  Oh, and after some time they have the right to sell your property or deposit your cash, so they literally have a money incentive to do so.
