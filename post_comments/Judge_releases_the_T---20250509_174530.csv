"This is great news for Ms. Ozturk to get out from an ICE hellhole!  But keep in mind our government is *still* trying to deport Ms. Ozturk solely based on her writing an op-ed in a school newspaper. And that's flat wrong.  Also, don't let people tell you courts don't work.",Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-09T17:53:23,18
Is she actually released?    As of this writing I have not seen anything in the news that says that she's actually been released.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T18:01:19,5

I just saw on NBC she was released. She looked tired and didn't really want to speak with the press outside the detention facility. I don't blame her.,Rock-n-roll-Kevin,2025-05-09T18:04:35,9
"Yes, I've confirmed that now, thank you.      I've been to 7 protests and taken a Rumeysa Ozturk poster to every one of them.  I've also been an ACLU member for years and it was ACLU of Massachusetts and ACLU of Vermont who handled her case.   When Trump was elected in 2016 I doubled my membership contribution and then did it again in 2024.      ACLU is bad-ass and has a really strong record of winning.    Bad guys shouldn't mess with them, good guys should donate to them https://aclu.org",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-10T06:42:16,1
