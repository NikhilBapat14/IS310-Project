AOC should stay with the Energy and Commerce Committee while at the same time giving full-throated support to Jasmine Crockett's run for chairman of the Oversight Committee.   &nbsp;  Ultimate objective: get as many Progressive chairmen in as many committee positions as possible.   &nbsp;,Ecstatic_Sign_6157,2025-04-28T21:10:28,33
Doubtless the Dems will find some other old guy and decide “it’s his turn”.,scordatura,2025-04-28T21:00:22,11
"I may be in a minority, but I think she’s done far more barnstorming the country with Sanders than she ever could have done from a committee room in the capitol.    Connolly has been working that job hard since he got it.  Does anyone know what he’s accomplished?",guttanzer,2025-04-28T22:01:59,8
"As the article said, Connolly hasn't stepped down or given any timeline. It's hard for her to make any decision yet.",ponyflip,2025-04-28T20:47:12,4
"Waiting for the Dems to look at a whatever she's doing and go ""nah we'd rather do this milquetoast old guy who's been sitting there for fifty years making no waves""",ClassicHando,2025-04-29T06:00:24,1
"There was 90 million that sat out this last election. Everyone says they ""wanted a centered"" democrat. I'm betting some of those 90 million... at least some... were waiting for this.",williamgman,2025-04-28T20:37:41,0

She voted in favor of the Take It Down act.  May her star go out.,EarthlingSil,2025-04-28T20:45:21,-57
"I’d have to give it a good think, but a gut immediate response would be that I agree. Some people are behind the desk people and some are  cut the shit, get it done people. My current perspective is that she’s the latter; and in a role of either a house member or the senate, I personally see way more sir & formulate people.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-29T02:52:03,1
For AOC to get a committee assignment? That’s an incredibly beltway thing that only people engaged with politics would know or care about,mightcommentsometime,2025-04-29T00:59:45,0
