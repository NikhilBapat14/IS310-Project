It was his plan all along. Stocks get to bargain basement prices and people in the know swoop in . Rich get richer. Trump and his billionaire buddies. It would be interesting to see timeline on portfolios.,Silent_Section_6409,2025-04-07T13:23:12,4
Didn’t Bush have an 18% drop in 2001? That would make Trump number two.,prrudman,2025-04-07T09:48:32,2

"I mean, CNN answered their own question in the first few sentences.  Anything he accuses others of doing is exactly what he has done or will do.  History has proven this correct.  This is a non article",Euphoric_Grass_5973,2025-04-08T07:06:48,1
I’m beginning to think neither the courts nor his own party have any desire to put an end to this,amievenrelevant,2025-04-07T20:22:59,3
"almost every economist on the right and the left saying that the felon king is driving the US economy off a cliff.  Only those harming the country with the magical and malignant thinking believe there is any sort of justification for harming millions upon millions of Americans with loss of jobs, loss of retirement funds, and loss of businesses",rhino910,2025-04-07T08:50:57,10
"He's doing this out of revenge. Revenge for the four years he wasn't POTUS and people made fun of him.  He's a thin skinned narcissist, and this is what you get when you cross one of those...he'll gladly destroy the country if it destroys the people who don't worship him.",forrestfaun,2025-04-07T08:53:41,4
"The article says Bush had a similar drop, but the market was already in a decline when Bush took office so it is difficult to blame the drop on him. The dot com bubble caused the start of the decline the previous year. This shit is fully on Trump to own.",jbronwynne,2025-04-07T11:55:49,8

"> Yes...but he just seems to get eerily lucky with shit. It's why he got out of jail time and other horrible shit  It was the corrupt judges he appointed, combined with Garland's slowness to act, that saved the felon from his deserved jail time",rhino910,2025-04-07T09:09:22,6
