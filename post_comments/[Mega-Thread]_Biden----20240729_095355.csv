Well the first and most obvious questions is: What would it take to put any of that into effect?  A constitutional amendment seems to be a non-starter.  And I can't imagine any Republicans going for term limits or enforced ethics for their guys.  So is this dead in the water?  I just lost a LOT of respect for this subreddit with the mod removal of comments.,limbodog,2024-07-29T10:08:56,15

"I think there should be term limits for any seat In The government, is it congress who doesn't have them or is that a different area?",Shoddy-Rope5171,2024-08-03T14:44:52,0
"> The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.  That's all it says about term limits in the constitution. The rest is governed by law and tradition.   First two can be done without an amendment. Though the term limits are a bit of a stretch.   Enforceable Code of Ethics outlines ""good behavior"" since up until now the courts have done this internally and the impeachment process is one outlined in law not constitutional already.   Term limits basically relies on the fact that ""lifetime appointments"" have always been more tradition than explicit law. Just need Congress behind it.    Both of these will still be tough with the house in control of the right. Doable but if they fail it's something for Kamala to run on.   You get the 3rd passed by getting Kamala elected and scaring them into passing it because 4years of immunity for a Democrat isn't something they want.",ShadeofIcarus,2024-07-29T10:27:12,8

"Its essentially DOA as none of this will even get the necessary support in the House or Senate (if they go the traditional route) and a convention of the states has never happened.  Term limits requires a constitutional amendment.  Judges are appointed for life in [Article III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_2:_Tenure) so long as they continue to maintain ""good behavior"".  So the first item is entirely DOA.  Ethics Code is a bit more iffie on whether it would need a constitutional amendment or not.  The Judiciary is a co-equal branch to the Executive and Legislative, so whether it can have anything put onto it by the other two would... be determined by the courts.  But presumably, this is DOA as well.  The other Constitutional Amendment... I'm personally find if we want to remove immunity, but get ready for a whole lot of ""shoe on the other foot"" next time a Republican gets into office and decides to second-guess and/or use the DOJ to go after Biden or Harris or Obama.  Would Obama be criminally liable for drone strikes on Americans?  That's the classic counter-argument.  I'm sure a lot of motivated Republican legal scholars would love to dive deeper.  And nevermind it also wouldn't get through the amendment process.  So basically... its all DOA.  Its a sop to his base to try and get them excited for the election.",LordFoxbriar,2024-07-29T10:19:02,4

">First two can be done without an amendment. Though the term limits are a bit of a stretch.   If legislation and the Constitution are in opposition, the Constitution wins.

If Congress did somehow pass this, the moment they tried to remove a Justice they'd have to show he was no longer in ""good behavior"".  And generally its agreed that to prove that, you need to impeach them, which is also detailed in the Constitution.  >Enforceable Code of Ethics outlines ""good behavior"" since up until now the courts have done this internally and the impeachment process is one outlined in law not constitutional already.

">the House or Senate (if they go the traditional route) and a convention of the states has never happened.  Just to expand on this since you kind of blew over listing the requirements, a [United States Constitutional Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution) can be proposed in one of two ways:  1. Two thirds of each house of Congress vote on the amendment 2. Two thirds of the state legislatures voting to request a convention to propose amendments  The second path, a ""Convention of the states"" as he states, has never been done (although there are efforts today to do so, mostly in Republican circles.  More on this in a second.)  Once an amendment is proposed, it then needs to be ratified by three-quarters of the states.  Now, back to the convention because I'm a political nerd and love to point out that there are always untended consequences.  While the Congressional method specifies a *singular* amendment, the convention method is not limited to that.  Once 2/3 of the states call for the convention, it starts and *any* amendments can be proposed:  >on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments  So let's say that 34 states do ask for that convention for one of these topics, the other amendments can be proposed as well.

"Ethics Code is just a law that outlines ""good behavior"". If you break the code, you can be removed.   Article 3 never explicitly enumerates lifetime. It's been something that has been a mix of tradition and common law.  The irony is that a textualist interpretation of the law leads to understanding that the appointment is just required to keep good behavior and not explicitly lifetime.  Because the power of lifetime appointments isn't given explicitly, it passes onto the legislature to define the term limits as they choose.  It's still DoA because the house is Republican controlled, but it's something that can pass if the house and Senate swing blue enough in November.  Some of the best legal minds worked on this.

That is not technically accurate even if that is how the SC will see it. It is specifically called out in your post that lifetime appointments is a tradition, but if a law expressly stated that a SC can't serve more than 18 years then they wouldn't be in Good Standing if they served longer.

The ""how"" is basically a mix of Senate tradition and law. There's nothing in the constitution that says ""an impeachment should be run like this"" is more my point. Obviously the concept of impeachment is in the constitution. How is not.   There's no law that's going to pass that says ""break these rules and you're gone"". Not one that is constitutional. What enforceable means is pretty broad. Could be fines. Could be rules that force judges to recuse themselves in certain circumstances. Could be guidelines that give more weight to stare decisis.

"Bear in mind that said user is flaired as libertarian. I don't mean it as a negative but it's going to inform their interpretation.   The 10th amendment states that anything that isn't given in the constitution is given to the states, then to the people. The libertarian stance is close to how you describe. If the constitution doesn't let them do it to us. They shouldn't be allowed to (extreme libertarians believe that the government shouldn't be allowed to legislate what drugs we use for example).   In the end it's all interpretation. The one you're putting forth is more commonly understood as ""the people vote for representatives and the representatives enact the will of the people within the bounds of the Constitution"".   The reality is somewhere in the middle of the two. The legislature can't really enact what majority want with disregard to the constitution, checks and balances, and the expectations set forth. But the general idea in this case is that the laws being passed are part of the checks and balances.

">For example, the constitution doesn’t say anything about drugs, but we have a ton of legislation around that.  There is a difference between the Constitution not saying anything on a subject (drugs, for example), and the Constitution speaking to something and not being verbose about it.  The famous example is the requirements for President I used earlier.  Courts have ruled that because the Constitution *did* speak to the requirements, those are the *only* requirements that can be enforced.  The Legislature (and especially the states) can't come back and, through only legislation, add to those rules.  Only additional Constitutional Amendments can alter (or replace) those rules (such as after the Civil War).  If it doesn't speak to a subject, then there are one of two lines of thought - the Constitution might not speak to things that would emerge later, but if they had known it most likely be part of the Constitution (such as allowing the federal government to create the Air Force because it allows it to create an Army and Navy and the Air Force is a logical and direct line) or it truly is open for the legislature to do anything.
