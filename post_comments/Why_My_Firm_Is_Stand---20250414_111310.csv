We once again go to court to do just that. To do otherwise would mean compromising our ability to zealously advocate for all of our clients and capitulating to unconstitutional government coercion, which is simply not in our DNA.” It gives me goose bumps when I read that, because it’s absolutely true. I’m so proud that our firm—leadership, partners, associates, and staff—is sticking together and doing the right thing.  It is well established that “the First Amendment prohibits government officials from retaliating against individuals for engaging in protected speech.” The order retaliates against Jenner for engaging in protected speech. According to the order, Jenner must be punished because it engaged “in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends,” such as representations on behalf of immigrants and transgender people. Legal advocacy is a form of speech. Jenner is being punished for speaking.  Legal Summary:  Adam Unikowsky, a partner at Jenner & Block, argues that President Trump’s executive order targeting his law firm—and others—is unconstitutional retaliation that violates multiple provisions of the U.S. Constitution:  First Amendment Violations:  Retaliation for Protected Speech: The executive order punishes Jenner for legal advocacy on behalf of immigrants and transgender clients, and for associating with Andrew Weissmann—both acts of protected speech and association.  Right to Petition: Filing lawsuits is constitutionally protected; punishing a firm for this infringes the petition clause.  Viewpoint Discrimination: The government is targeting the firm based on disagreement with its clients’ positions, violating viewpoint neutrality.  Compelled Disclosure: Forcing government contractors to report ties with Jenner discourages association, infringing on First Amendment freedoms.  Fifth and Sixth Amendment Due Process Violations:  Lack of Notice and Hearing: The executive order was issued unilaterally without giving Jenner prior notice or opportunity to respond.  Vagueness: The standards for punishment are undefined, making it unclear which actions may lead to future retaliation.  Right to Counsel: The restrictions impair Jenner’s ability to represent clients—especially in criminal cases—interfering with clients’ right to their counsel of choice and with attorney-client confidentiality.  Equal Protection Violation (Fifth Amendment):  The executive order singles out Jenner for adverse treatment based on political animus, without any neutral legal basis.  Separation of Powers Concerns:  The president is interfering with the judicial process by punishing law firms for representing clients in litigation against the government.  This undermines the independence of the legal profession and the courts.  Chilling Effect and Structural Harm:  The order is designed to deter law firms from representing politically disfavored clients.  Settlements between firms and the government compromise legal independence, effectively turning private law firms into agents of the administration.  Unikowsky argues that these executive orders are part of a broader strategy to intimidate legal opposition and conscript elite law firms into the president’s political agenda, threatening the constitutional balance and the rule of law.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-14T11:14:00,11
"Good for them!  One issue not being discussed is the lack of attorneys holding office and/or working in/on behalf of the government today.   With fewer DOJ attorneys in hand, and malfeasance abounding, the administration is strong arming pro bono work for all their shennanigans.   https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/government-attorneys-scrambling-to-leave",Popular-Drummer-7989,2025-04-14T11:41:21,3
