"“In Mr. Bukele, the White House had a willing ally, albeit one with specific demands, including a list of high-ranking MS-13 gang leaders he wanted sent back to El Salvador as part of the deal.  That stoked alarm among some U.S. law enforcement officials. The Justice Department has spent years building cases against MS-13 leaders for criminal activities in the United States, alleging that the gang has been protected by the Salvadoran government.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Bukele, who has denied those claims, did not respond to requests for comment.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said he worked directly with the government of El Salvador “to deport as many dangerous gang members illegally in America as possible,” is now looking for other foreign partners, as well.  “I intend to continue to try and identify other countries willing to accept and jail as many gang members as we can send them,” Mr. Rubio said in a statement.”",littleoldlady71,2025-05-05T15:47:50,3
