"The Washington Post is lying about this bill. Just like Trump claims that defunding universities is about ""antisemitism"" or kicking trans people out of the military is about protecting children, it's a silly lie to say this bill is about fighting revenge porn.  Trump wants to use this bill to censor anything he doesn't like. The bill includes the language to do it. It's not limited to deepfakes or revenge porn, it gives the administration broad leeway to come after any sites that host criticisms of administration policies. It doesn't contain protection against false reports which will be a huge burden for sites to manage.  Only the biggest players like Facebook will have the resources to ""comply"".

"The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday voted overwhelmingly to pass a bill aimed at cracking down on the posting of sexual images and videos of people online without their consent, including AI-generated “deepfake” nudes of real people.  The bipartisan [Take It Down Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/633), which passed the Senate unanimously in February, now heads to the desk of President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it into law. The bill makes it a federal crime to publish [nonconsensual intimate imagery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/05/ai-deepfake-porn-teens-women-impact/), or NCII, of any person and requires online platforms to remove such imagery within 48 hours when someone reports it.  That would make it the first significant internet law of Trump’s second term and the first U.S. law to take aim at the fast-growing problem of NCII. The bill’s passage delighted many advocates for survivors and victims of revenge porn and “sextortion” scams, while some free-expression and privacy advocates said they worry it will be abused.  The legislation’s passage by a vote of 409-2 marks a victory for first lady Melania Trump, who has [championed the bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/03/04/melania-trump-be-best-deepfakes-law/) as part of her “Be Best” campaign against cyberbullying. The president indicated in March that he plans to sign it — and quipped that it is a personal boon, “because nobody gets treated worse than I do online.”  Read more here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/28/congress-deepfake-revenge-porn-law/?utm\_campaign=wp\_main&utm\_medium=social&utm\_source=reddit.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/28/congress-deepfake-revenge-porn-law/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)",washingtonpost,2025-04-29T08:43:58,0

The fact that people were dead-on about these kinds of AI restriction bills passing only AFTER it affects people in power...,Extension-Dot-9106,2025-04-29T08:52:02,2
"Uh...it's been affecting lots of people, both in power and out of power, since AI was first unleashed. There are deepfakes of AoC and Biden that are years old. AoC is probably one of the earliest and biggest targets of AI deepfakes. ",Bakedads,2025-04-29T09:02:35,0
"I’ll point out that AoC is a non-white progressive woman. While yes she is a person in power, I will concede on that, I don’t think it’s a coincidence that this is being passed after a deepfake of Trump and Elon was plastered all over a government building. Trump is also just straight up making this about himself, that he’s the most egregious victim, as if his own wife hasn’t seen this sort of abuse for years. I doubt if this never touched him in such an embarrassing way that he would’ve cared in the least.",Extension-Dot-9106,2025-04-29T14:04:19,1
