This is awful. I guess they don’t want young people to volunteer doing good works for the country. Probably because they want to put them to work in the “newly re-opened”coal mines.,RobsSister,2025-04-19T22:57:03,3
"When MAGA, this administration, or the so-called “GOP” try to gaslight you with that tired line about how we care more about “illegals” than Americans or veterans, tell them to fuck all the way off. This used to be a no-brainer, bipartisan program that had support across the aisle, now it’s been gutted. Funny how that works when compassion and common sense become partisan liabilities.  Just another “senseless” piece of spending on the chopping block. 🤷   “AmeriCorps placed most staff members on administrative leave with pay this week, effective immediately, according to a staff member and an internal memo shared with The Associated Press.  The agency oversees a number of volunteering programs and dispatches 200,000 volunteers across the country to work with schoolchildren, veterans and older adults, among other things, according to its website. AmeriCorps NCCC, which completed its 30th year last year, employs more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 26 participating for a roughly 10-month service term, according to the program’s website.”",Excellent_Pirate8224,2025-04-19T15:41:59,2
