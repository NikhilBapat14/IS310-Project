Recession can benefit the rich in many ways. Poor people loosing assets is a cheap asset buying opportunity for them. So Trump **is** doing what he promised. He most likely barely considers your existence if you're poor.,IDontGoHardIGoHome,2025-04-27T05:49:48,31
They were livid and raging about the price of eggs in 2024 because the propagandists told them to be. Egg prices are higher now. But none of them care because they are not being told to.  None of this is organic. It's all manufactured with propaganda. And almost nothing that happens in the real world can have any effect inside the fash/MAGA fantasy world.,OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-27T06:58:33,20
This is the one factor that Trump can't lie his way out of. Even now he's announcing that grocery prices are lower even though the opposite is true. Maybe his cult followers will believe him over their own eyes but the majority of people understand basic math. Trump could be a successful president if he creates a good economy for working class folks but that is just not going to happen.,joekerr9999,2025-04-27T05:42:44,7

He can’t fix anything otherwise how can he promise us this on day 1 of his 3rd term!,zffjk,2025-04-27T07:09:46,3
Day 1 - no economical improvement.  Day 10 - no economical improvement.  Day 100 - economy is tanking.  Day 1000 - ?,Decorah1,2025-04-27T11:13:00,3

Lies and more lies. Denied project 2025 and cuts to benefits.  Thx maga.,oldfed2005,2025-04-27T10:47:27,2
Not waiting for a fucking thing. We’re counting. Days. Weeks. Months… Felonies. It’s really getting difficult to tell which is an official increment of time these days.,No_Ant_7255,2025-04-27T16:25:25,2

"The original story, Trump makes impossible promises, was never reported.",redredbloodwine,2025-04-27T09:40:06,1

Some are still waiting for infrastructure week from the first term.,blackmobius,2025-04-27T16:00:40,1
Why?   It. Was. A. Lie.   Why are we still waiting for a lie to magically become the truth just waiting to be fulfilled?   It’s time for us to grow up.,PaulWoolsey,2025-04-27T18:53:42,1

Or they believe Trump when he says prices are down. They ignore what they see at the store and just trust the orange turd.,Dopdee,2025-04-27T09:05:56,7
I have little hope they will. They’d sacrifice everything just to avoid having to admit they were wrong.,The-Reanimator-Freak,2025-04-27T12:02:05,2

Well all prices ARE down in MAGA fantasyworld. I mean maybe you're not seeing it where you are. But that's some kind of random interference from the real-world that you can ignore. Everybody knows! Everybody says so! And you know what happens when people commit woke by disagreeing. So SAY IT: PRICES ARE DOWN. PRICES ARE DOWN. SO SAY WE ALL.,OhGodSoManyQuestions,2025-04-27T09:15:00,3
I’d love to see an episode of The Price is Right with Trump as a contestant.,MerisiCalista,2025-04-27T10:54:01,2
