"""Don't believe your lying eyes.  Don't believe obvious negative outcome metrics.  Follow science, but not, you know, data science.  Or fundamental concepts of physiology.  All hail '$cience' and our corporate masters at Big Pharma!  Only through Their Divine Grace shall we be purified!""  \-The Left.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-30T22:43:51,2
"We are one of the only countries in the world that allows pharmaceuticals to advertise their products directly to consumers. You can‚Äôt watch a 30 mi Ute television show here without seeing 20 ads for various prescription medications for a whole bevy of issues. All of which carry a heavy price tag to pay for said advertising. It is far past time we abolish this sort of nonsense. Apart from lowering the prices on said medications because they now can‚Äôt spend millions a year advertising them, it should make our doctors lives far easier as well. Every time I see one of these commercials, I can‚Äôt help but think how a doctor must feel to have patients constantly coming in and asking them to prescribe the latest glamour remedy they heard about on TV.",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-05-01T05:04:20,3

"""Every time I see one of these commercials, I can‚Äôt help but think how a doctor must feel to have patients constantly coming in and asking them to prescribe the latest glamour remedy they heard about on TV.""  I asked my doctor about that recently, as I was curious about it. He told me neither he, nor any doctors he knows, have ever had a patient ask for a medication because of a TV commercial. He also said he would never prescribe based on that, so it would be pointless.   So it really is a waste of money by big pharma, though I suspect it's more some sort of disguised PR campaign than about sales.",Faelwolf,2025-05-01T10:10:21,2
We allow freedom of speech and ask that people and their doctors act responsibility on their own behalf? ü§Ø,thatrightwinger,2025-05-01T05:24:03,0
"Interesting. And yes it does beg the question, that if people aren‚Äôt going to their doctors to ask about it, what exactly is the point of advertising it?",Tasty_Explanation_20,2025-05-01T15:49:54,2
