"In no way is this going to be isolated to nonessential baby products.  Everything a parent needs to raise a baby is going to become extremely expensive. They will no have zero toys. Middle class households will be lucky have the basic necessities. And the lower classes are going to be abject poverty if they have children right now.  As warned from the very first day he campaigned on tarriffs, these are going to be hurt the most vulnerable demographics first.  37.3% of American children are on medicaid. A lot of children will die because of the cuts and now parents will not be able to afford the most critical products needed to raise them.   Products like car seats are going to be unaffordable for most of these parents and that's a product you should never buy used. **So many babies and children of all ages are going to die as a direct result of these Medicaid cuts and tariffs.**",Minute-Individual-74,2025-05-01T06:47:07,25

"This ""logic"" (classic fallacy by the way) is so typical of autocrats and especially when combined with severe histrionic disorder it reaches superb heights.   Using the exact same ""logic"" one can easily extrapolate to: less food (as some from recent history put it, well, one can put up with food rationing for a while during the great execution of a great plan), less heating (well, as another character from late 20th c. put it, we can all put on a jumper for a while because we will be great and amazing soon and beat the decadent West) and so on and on.   The beautiful thing about such fallacies is how psychopathically deranged and totally lacking empathy they are - and how their fans still applaud it but AT THE SAME TIME claim they are very Christian and nobody is more Christian than them.  The only thing more blindingly obvious than their deranged logic is their self-contradiction.",neodiodorus,2025-05-01T08:25:00,1

At the moment we can walk into a department store and find \~30 plus types of dolls to buy.  His suggestion is not that their would be 30 types of dolls to buy at a higher price, but there would only be 2 types of dolls to buy at a higher price. The variety and availability we be lost.  The lost in higher price is one thing, the lost in availability and variety is a much scarier thing. This creates monopolies and not capitalistic.  It's very close to saying you have 4 member family and you get one barbie doll for your girl and the boy gets one matchbox car. You can only buy one car and it has to be a telsa model 3.

Rather than investing time and resources into our local markets & workforce and finding ways to make housing and other basic necessities affordable. Because why do X, if Y is a lot easier & yields faster results?   It does absolutely not help that thesr corporations are also the ones buying up whatever housing & land there still is, knowing that people will ALWAYS want exactly that, meaning that they can make additional profit that way / keep their money safe in assets that should be acessible to all, not just the very few who have gobbled up most of the wealth, often times by doing exactly what I said: producing crap.",Attreah,2025-05-01T07:06:01,-1

We don't need all of this brakable/disposable plastic crap sent on barges halfway across the planet. Less plastic and less shipping containers are a good thing. I remember the days of the left saying things like ""it would be less struggle than what we went through in ww2 to fix global warming."" And "" 5 years of hard work and we can be done with it."" Now it's we have to keep getting umpteen shipments a day of plastic bullshit from China or the world is gonna end.",robby_synclair,2025-05-01T10:35:19,-3

"I don‚Äôt disagree with you and largely embrace anti consumerism sentiment. lol I actually talk about it all the time and think we would get along. I still think children benefit from that kind of stimulation. I think a larger problem is adults who have to buy new phones, cars, etc every few years instead of making do with what they have. I despise fast fashion. I am high income and drive my cars into the ground, keep phones long enough to need to change the batteries, sell my used PC parts to encourage require (software dev so need to keep my computer pretty modern), etc   Also cook 99+% of the food we eat from scratch including bread pasta etc, we rarely buy packaged goods bc we are so anti everything you‚Äôre against too. We even sew a lot of our clothes.  I don‚Äôt think we are in disagreement at all.  I guess I just worry about kids not having the life I had growing up. We didn‚Äôt buy a lot of excess food other but I had some toys and things to occupy my time and never had to worry about food to anything.",ibeerianhamhock,2025-05-01T19:12:18,1

"I think that's all good and well. It's a question of the system we have vs the system we want. We have this right here, right now. Folks in some sense demand it. The problem isn't solved though by tariffing goods that will take years to even begin making here. And even if we make them here, there is no guarantee of their quality. Lastly, making them here doesn't guarantee a good wage, affordable housing, education and healthcare. It just restructures the location of production at a cost to the consumer. And that's at best. At worst, it simply increases cost to consumer while nothing gets moved here. And why would it move here, during a lame duck presidency, when odds are they'll get lifted in 4 years and consumers will probably pay a bit more for what they want and need?",Jabberwocky2022,2025-05-01T08:19:16,1

"Yes these are problems that need solutions. I'm not supporting Trump. I'm not even stating my opinion. I'm just saying that it wasn't that long ago that Democrats were against the Human rights violations happening in the labor sector of China(now we can't afford to live without them). Democrats were for lowering carbon emissions, a cargo ship averages 109 gallons of fuel per mile (now it's terrible that the ports aren't full at all times). Democrats wanted to do something about the garbage patch that is 620,000 square miles (this is a 2 pattern, 1 we need the Chinese tankers to keep loading our garbage in and 2 we need all the plastic doodads that China sends us to add to the patch, or people won't survive until their next paycheck).

However inadvertent it might have been that is stopping and I'm OK with it. The democrats are arguing every chance they get that we need these shipments or society will implode.
