"The majority of the people in our politics covered by the media are just straight up mentally ill. And that's where we're at as a society.  It should be part of the standard human operating system to be able to identify these people as having a mental illness and not to place them in positions of enormous power and for some reason not only are most people not able to tell, but they appear to be leadership material in the eyes of many.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-02T16:18:16,29

"Agree but it's probably because most 'regular' people can't understand a sociopath/ psychopath / malignant narcissist having no or very little empathy. They don't understand that some of these these people have a predator vs prey mentality and play to win, destroying everyone and everything if necessary. They just can't see these people being truly devoid of decency and almost want to be friends because they seem confident and strong, which they reason are good traits ( it's easier than recognising you've been fooled). I think the world needs more education on such personality disorders. Right now we have a situation where most of our politicians and leaders are being 'decent' and giving these people the benefit of the doubt.",gizajobicandothat,2025-05-02T17:55:20,3
Itâ€™s not mental illness. Itâ€™s pandering to the cameras to take up reporting space and generate outrage and distraction.  Thereâ€™s no value here except in generating the comment you just made to anger and alienate the electorate.,viaJormungandr,2025-05-02T16:54:08,1
