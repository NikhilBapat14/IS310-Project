"Watters asked Coristine about his latest work within DOGE and what he'd uncovered. He said that he’s been looking through U.S. Treasury Department payment computers and finding a multitude of outgoing payments from the federal government that include no details about who they’re going to and why.  ""So one of our initiatives is to root out fraud and waste, and to do that we started looking at the payment computers. And, as mentioned earlier, there’s no accounting of what payments actually go to in the payment computer,"" he said.  Coristine continued, ""You look at a specific line item – $20 million. You’re like, ‘OK, what it is this money going to?’ And for the majority of payment systems, it’s like, ‘Well, we don’t really know.’""",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-02T13:29:04,32
"Liberals refuse to believe this is possible because it’s a Republican lead administration that identified it.   I can’t use a company card for a pack of gum without having full scanned images of the receipt and a expense report in fine detail submit, but they are sending out million dollar checks with no line items.",RadiantWhole2119,2025-05-02T15:34:35,29
