You should be able to get rid of the loans with bankruptcy just like other loans. Why do student loans get special rules?,daved1113,2025-05-05T10:21:42,314
"In the near future, there should be a reckoning with higher ed, both in the cost, loan scam, and efficacy of many four year degrees on job prosepcts, education, and practicality. Certain people absolutely need college education (doctors, lawyers, scientists, etc) and other benefit from a traditional liberal arts education (ability to read, write, think, research). But what passes for a basic 4 year degree now in terms of cognitive advancement, job placement, and especially cost is nothing short of embarassing.   In the near term, the education institutions not only need reform but need to be held accountable for the loan scam and absurd costs theyve levied on students with false promises of career placement. The students should be on the hook for some or most of the loan burden, but I wouldnt be opposed to the Feds getting some restitution from universities that took in heaps of cash on the backs of students. Raid the endowments, sell of real estate, fire the hoardes or bureaucrats filling the institutions. They are equally as liable as the students who accepted the loans.   All these students and recent grads (largely left leaning) out protesting Trump, Israel, etc can easily be turned on the institutions that indebted them, and are also responsible for brainwashing them. I know theyre upset, but maybe they should be a little bit more upset with the schools that lied to them and took their money.",milton1775,2025-05-05T10:26:57,79

">College is not even worth it anymore better off getting into the trades these days.  Not going to deny that the financial value is decreasing because of diploma creep (caused by Duke v.

Even the aforementioned disparate impact provision is being challenged by this admin.  Retreating from universities means abandoning access to key levers of power.

"I really think higher ed should be geared directly towards job placement in addition to obtaining a degree. At my college, job assistance was provided as a secondary form of assistance, but it was never considered as part of the degree process. All they really did was help with writing a resume and talk about job searching strategies.

I amassed a mountain of debt from loans. I went into public service and had them forgiven after 10 years of tireless work with low pay. But it was worth it. I’m a big supporter of public service student loan forgiveness. Get the grads experience , and in a role they give back to the community.

Most relevant training and experience is gotten on the job anyways. We’d be better off if businesses would start inexperienced workers at a much lower salary on a temporary basis with a contract in place to increase pay significantly after a certain amount of time or once they’ve met certain performance metrics related to that job.

"I think a lot of it is that while contract work looks appealing, the problem is lawsuits. As an independent contractor, you have no legal protection from a company legal team if something went wrong. It’s just on you. So you’d have to pony up for a lawyer, which isn’t cheap.   I’d often considered quitting IT and going into another trade and becoming a contractor myself, becoming my own boss, living on my own schedule. But 1) then I’m at the mercy of customers and have to hope I can keep finding and lining up work or things will get financially tough, and 2) risk lawsuits over frivolous things because everyone loves to sue these days.  Then on top of that, what if you’re not union if in a trade that unionizes typically? The area unions give you legal (and maybe even physical) grief just for trying to line up work in their areas, and then you face those headaches too.  Also now you’re paying your own insurances and saving for retirement yourself with no match benefits.  That’s why if I had to go back and do it all over again, I’d ditch college or just get a two-year degree and go to a trade school instead but seek full time direct hire employment somewhere, rising up the ranks as I go.",ITrCool,2025-05-05T11:30:20,16
