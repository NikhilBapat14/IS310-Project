"*The biggest story from Australia’s election was the collapse by Dutton, the leader of a conservative coalition made up of his Liberal Party and the rural National Party. **He became the first opposition leader to lose his seat in an Australian federal election.** The former police officer had waged a Trump-like culture war against diversity programs and “woke” school programing, even promising an Australian version of the U.S. DOGE Service.*",Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-03T11:01:35,8

Yep. I saw the polls in the last  few days - It looked like  a conservative loss. The reality was it was a massive liberal win. First time in over 35 years that a Liberal Prime Minster was elected to two successive terms.,dkorabell,2025-05-03T10:01:02,7
"This headline is spot on: Buoyed by an anti trump bump. Not solely due to it.   Being unlikeable, focussing on weird things, and not releasing some major chunks of policy until way too late were also big ones.",ZotBattlehero,2025-05-03T12:31:11,3
It's nice to see democratic nations rejecting the far-right.  Seeing what Trump is doing certainly helps.,Troubled202,2025-05-03T14:34:32,2

"From the article:  SYDNEY — Australia’s center-left government convincingly won reelection Saturday in a remarkable turnaround driven partly by anger over President Donald Trump’s disruptive trade war and its impact on the close U.S. military ally.  Anthony Albanese became the first Australian prime minister to win a second term in more than two decades as his Labor Party dramatically increased its parliamentary majority. It marked a stunning comeback for the progressive leader, who trailed in the polls two months ago.  Yes in Australia the ‘Liberal’ party is center-right and the ‘Labor’ party is center-left  *The Australian Labor Party (ALP), also known simply as the Labor Party, or just Labor, is the major centre-left political party in Australia and one of two major parties in Australian politics,along with the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia. The party has been in government since the 2022 federal election*  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party",Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-03T10:55:06,2

And the Conservative Party leader lost his own seat just like in Canada!  It was glorious,Competitive_Ad291,2025-05-03T10:04:02,8
Confusing comment because the conservative party that lost is called the Liberal Party over there ha,what_the_shart,2025-05-03T10:41:48,8
The weird things is the Coaltion (party who lost) has never really been far right. It swung that way drastically since Trump won his election in 2024 and the coalition leader thought culture wars and identity politics must be the way to victory. What has been rejected here is identity politics/culture war. You can see this by the fact that the far right (One nation and Trumpet of patriots parties) and far left (greens party) all failed to win a single seat. The coalition who also engaged in negative hit-pieces and identity politics handed a landslide victory to the only major party that kept its politics clean. Labour. It's less about the political orientation of the parties and more about the cleanliness of conduct. Trump links of course don't help either.,Ashen_Brad,2025-05-04T06:12:13,1

Don't give up hope. Canada looked really dire a few months back. Fight for decency. Fight for humanity We got this.,Cthulhuareyou,2025-05-03T10:45:39,18
"This unfortunately has more to do with the total fucking uselessness of the Labour Party in the UK. Similar to the Democrats in the US, they've become entirely captured by special interests and populated by careerists with no ideals and no backbone who are just in it for the perks and the airtime.  I don't think much of either the Australian Labor Party or the Canadian Liberals, but they were able to offer an alternative vision to far-right mania. America and the UK have so far been unable to do that. UK Labour were elected solely because the Conservatives collapsed. No one actually likes them and they stand for nothing.",night_dude,2025-05-03T21:55:47,2
"The key words there being ""local elections"". You can't easily gauge general election results from local ones. They undoubtedly reflect moods, but we've seen over and over that people vote differently when they know it's about who will form the next government rather than the local council.",Farnsworthson,2025-05-04T14:11:45,1

"I still can't get used to the Idea that the Australian conservative party are called the Liberals. Although in order to  form a government, they united with the national party and usually the two are just referred to as the Coalition.",dkorabell,2025-05-03T10:46:29,1
"Yes, it still annoys me after  25+ years living here. Though they  are an alliance with the National party and usually the two are referred to as the Coalition party.",dkorabell,2025-05-03T10:49:12,2
"Yes I agree that Labor won on its record, policies and its leader Albanese. But it also massively helped that Dutton was so unpopular, and was leaning into Trumpism. His party even had one of their senators wearing a MAGA hat and Trump advisors had met with his party . And I can tell you there is an overwhelming ANTI TRUMP sentiment here in Australia. No, we don’t want that bullshit down here. It’s no wonder it was a landslide yesterday.",SixDuckies,2025-05-04T02:38:48,1

"John Howard was no Temu trump. Encouraged skilled migration, reformed gun laws, had a stupidly low unemployment rate, etc. He did attempt some pretty ultra-comservative things in the 1980s like trying to wind back Medicare, but learnt from his defeats and not only retained but improved it during his terms. The same can't be said for the current batch of conservative politicians in the US or Australia. You can point to things you don't like about him of course, as you can for every great PM we've ever had. But he gets mad respect from both sides of Australian politics for a reason.",Ashen_Brad,2025-05-04T06:02:57,1
"I think it's mostly just North Americans who associate the word ""liberal"" primarily with social liberalism. Most of the world thinks of economic liberalism, which is a right-wing ideology.",JovianSpeck,2025-05-03T22:50:42,5

"Look, nobody likes Trump, but it's more about the style of politics that Dutton engaged in. He started culture war/identity politics.
