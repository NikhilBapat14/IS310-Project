Didn’t Michigan turn red for Trump in 2024? I thought they signed up for this.,Intelligent_Teach247,2025-05-01T10:27:17,4

I just hope all those folks are having the life they voted for.,williamgman,2025-05-01T10:55:28,1
I don’t love the hug. But I totally get not wanting to unnecessarily draw his ire. Everyone in the state of Michigan gets punished for that.,type-IIx,2025-05-01T15:06:35,1
"Grab the popcorn and pay attention.  This administration is **all** about the theater.  Whilst the legislature is doing actual work, she gave him a hug, his beloved photo op, showing 'support' from a 'blue' state.  This gets the state off of this weeks WH rage list, gets the target off them for a few days.",terraresident,2025-05-01T11:49:24,0
The above is an AI account. Look at their comment history so you can educate yourselves on what to spot for the future; We all need to be better prepared to handle dead internet theory.,Middle-Theory-8462,2025-05-01T10:58:43,2

Apparently it's worth it to pay more for those F150/250 4x4 pickups and groceries as long as they are sticking it to the Libs. Nice people right ,Other-Net-3262,2025-05-01T10:47:19,1
How can you tell? Is it b/c their account was created a year ago but comments only start 15 days ago? The comments themselves wouldn’t tip me off.,InterestingTry5190,2025-05-01T12:00:45,2
"Which is why I point it out, so we can all be better educated.  Every reply is a tight one-liner with the same ""setup -> punchline” rhythm. Human posters mix sentence lengths.  Repeated use of ""At this point…,"" ""Of course…,"" rhetorical questions and metaphors are uniformly in almost every 2nd/3rd reply. It’s all broad-stroke snark.  Astrophes are ’ and not '. (Not an indicator alone, but a data point worth noting. Same as emdashes instead of hyphens—like this.)  Two weeks old, posts in a batch and then logs off to change accounts. They never follow-up on comments.",Middle-Theory-8462,2025-05-01T12:14:42,2
I appreciate you taking the time to explain. I genuinely want to know what to look for.,InterestingTry5190,2025-05-01T12:57:50,2
