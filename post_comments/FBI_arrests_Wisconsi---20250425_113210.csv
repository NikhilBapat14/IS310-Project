Clearly an intimidation effort by this criminal Administration to commandeer State and local officials for its corrupt ends. There is no requirement for State and local officials to assist the Feds and provide resources. All the more reason for States and localities loyal to the Constitution to band together to coordinate resources and funding among themselves to resist these sort of unlawful tactics.,tonyt4nv,2025-04-25T11:34:20,28
Meanwhile everyone in the Trump administration is more or less doing the same thing relative to other laws.,thistimelineisweird,2025-04-25T11:37:28,8

Hmmm…I wonder where all those state rights right wing patriots are saying about this? Shouldn’t they be clamoring to the heavens of Jack booted federal thugs messing with state rights? Hypocrites and criminals all these Republicans,Obsidian_knive85,2025-04-26T05:32:39,1

A judge who adheres to the applicable right and insists on the justification of an arrest is arrested. Excessive and abuse of state power. Another step on the way to the totalitarian system.,Spirited-Top3307,2025-04-25T12:36:11,4
"IKR? You wouldn't believe it, but there's someone out there so dumb, he's obstructing justice by refusing to return a wrongly deported man to the U.S. after it was ordered by the Supreme Court. I sure do hope someone arrests that moron someday.",dchunk82,2025-04-25T12:03:11,8
"Brother, ICE is our SS. They are illegally rounding up immigrants & US citizens and shipping them to foreign prisons. First, Judges have no legal requirement to help ICE therefore the judge did nothing illegal. Secondly, these federal agencies are enacting gross overreach of their given powers. This is an erosion of our civil liberties and human rights.",Rocket_League-Champ,2025-04-25T11:53:10,16
"And what exactly is the administration doing with that 9-0 ruling?   That seems like blatant fucking obstruction, so we can agree that they should also be arrested? Or is hypocrisy pre-cooked into you",PorQuePanckes,2025-04-25T13:06:57,6
"ICE did not have a judicial warrant for his arrest.  She told them to talk to the Chief of Court about getting one. They left, but did not get a warrant. The person they were their to arrest (illegally, because again, they did not have a warrant) left the building after the proceedings they were their for finished, and they seized him outside.  Given that they did not have a warrant for his arrest, categorically, they cannot argue the arrest was 'obstructed.'  The Supreme Court has already ruled, 9-0, that ICE *cannot* violate due process.",HerbaciousTea,2025-04-25T13:59:15,6
I can give you a list of politicians that you would make excuses for. One of them you voted for.,HiImDIZZ,2025-04-25T12:04:35,3
Like someone who refuses to comply with a 9-0 supreme court order? Should an elected official who admits to obstructing justice on live national tv be arrested? Who also brags about obstructing justice on social media?  Your argument is a wet fart,stjohns_jester,2025-04-25T12:43:01,3
How is she obstructing justice. She is ruling against an unlawful order.   Let me ask you this. What if Garland had judges arrested who struck down student debt relief. You’d be good with that right?,Accurate-Bumblebee54,2025-04-26T10:38:47,1

"The answer is: if the judge refused to comply with illegal orders, then she should be congratulated. If she committed a real crime, in the eyes of constitutional law and federal law etc. then an arrest may be warranted, but probably not announce via fucking tweet. Anyone playing devils advocate at this time is either acting in bad faith or beyond reach of empathy",Smart-Classroom1832,2025-04-25T12:33:02,5
