"Okay. There's a lot to unpack here.  First of all, be careful when generalizing about a whole group of people, especially without solid statistics. You might be surprised to find out that, in the United States, immigrants on average commit crime at lower rates than people born in the country (if you ask, I can try to find the study). I don't know what the statistics would be for Sweden, but that gets to my second point.  People are the product of their environment. Crime is born not out of someone's essence, but out of their desperation. Getting into the US is hard, but staying is potentially easier than in much of Europe. The US' lingua franca is English, which is already widely learned as an auxiliary language (a quarter of the world's population can speak English). Swedish has a fraction of as many speakers, meaning more immigrants will have to go through more language training than if they'd immigrated to a country that uses a widely-understood international language, such as Mandarin, French or Arabic.  As much as cultural conflicts rage on in my country's politics, immigration from Germany, Ireland, Italy, China, Vietnam, Latin America and elsewhere has slowly been changing the idea of what being ""American"" means. It used to always mean ""British-descended Caucasian, Protestant, etc."" Nowadays many, myself included, believe being ""American"" is more about the choices you make, not whomever you're descended from or whatever you believe in. That attitude change has gone hand-in-hand with a greater tolerance of multiple cultures, faiths and heritages than ever before in my country's history. I suspect Sweden has not had those waves of immigration opening up the idea of what it means to be ""Swedish."" If anything, Sweden's historical interactions with other European powers have probably caused a hardening of Swedish identity to distinguish it from that of its neighbors.  When the Mafia controlled the Italian-American communities in the early 20th Century, it was often because young men in those communities couldn't get legal work from willing employers. When the cartels of today get away with murder in Latino-American neighborhoods, it's often because of the fear that someone's gonna get deported if the police get involved. Xenophobia breeds crime and lets it fester. If crime really is higher among the Syrian immigrant population of Sweden, I believe a homogeneous image of ""Swedishness"" and outright prejudice are most to blame.",ArchdukeAlex8,2022-12-29T05:28:48,5
"Okay, so first of all, what is ""multiculturalism."" Is it a set of policies? If so, what policies? If not is the mere presence of certain people. If so, what people?  Second, you are complaining about having ""millions of 2nd and 3rd generations children of immigrants"" but of a crime spike since 2015. So immigration itself can't be the problem since you have had millions of immigrants and their children for two generations and are only complaining of a problem starting in 2015.   You then draw a connection to the 2015 wave of refugees from Syria, so could there be something specific about the circumstances of those refugees that make ""immigration"" more difficult? For instance, the trauma that they faced in Syria or the speed by which they had to leave. How many Syrians in 2015, who five years earlier couldn't imagine leaving their country, do you think learned Swedish?  So maybe think about how Sweden dealt with the influx of refugees. Was Sweden prepared? Did it offer them support? Job opportunities?",loselyconscious,2022-12-30T04:00:34,4
"How much autocratic tendency does it take for it to not qualify by your standards?  Both the US and India have had quite a bit of multiculturalism at times; though they've also had troubles at times with some dark tendencies.  Iirc also Indonesia, though I'm less familiar with it.  Is two cultures enough?  There's a sizeable divergence in Canada between the French and English speaking parts.  Also, with multiple cultures it can depend on what the dispute points and variances are between the cultures.  For instance, much of Western Europe gets along fine each other, and immigrants between them have no significant troubles; but there's still a long term tension between the Dutch and French parts of Belgium.",zlefin_actual,2022-12-29T09:24:26,3
"Can it work? Sure, it definitely can. It is however not easy. It takes a lot of work to build shared institutions that work across a verity of different kinds of demographic diversity.",MWBartko,2022-12-29T05:49:27,2
"There is no evidence multiculturalism works. There are complicated reasons for that. However, terms like ""iron fist"", fascist or dictatorship, not liberal democracy.",Consistent-Quality-6,2022-12-31T10:13:36,0
">Anyways here was some background information on why multiculturalism does not work in Sweden so back to my original question.   You provided an example of what happens when you take a population of people traumatized by war and displacement and hurl them into a place that's a world away from what they're used to into a population of people who may or may not want them around and where they don't fit in.  That's not a ""multiculturalism"" issue. The exact same process has happened for centuries whenever an influx of a certain population gets rapidly introduced into a new place. It would absolutely happen if tens of thousands of Swedes were suddenly forced to migrate to Syria or Somalia to escape a civil war or ongoing conflict with a foreign invader.  As to the broader question - yes.  How do we know this? Because we did it for literally thousands of years.  ""Multiculturalism"" was the way the world worked up until fairly recently and the advent of hard borders and citizenship.   The problems start when you try to draw those hyper specific lines of who belongs and who doesn't. Rome ran into a lot of trouble because they got obsessed with who was and wasn't Roman and a lot of blood was spilled because ""non-Romans"" were being allowed into the empire.",HeloRising,2023-01-06T05:03:47,1
