"Trump, listen buddy, you are inherently a despicable person.¬†   Sure, some might love you for it, some might even like what you are currently doing, others might hate you for it and what you have done so far.   But the fact is still the same.  You are a¬†horrible, self-righteous, vile, mean and spiteful little man who cares about no one but yourself. And you should fucking feel bad for it, but you won't.    so, you know... Fuck you.",Affectionate_Mix5081,2025-04-23T16:24:28,21

God. It‚Äôs not a strategy. He thinks we‚Äôre haters and he thinks we‚Äôre bad people so he says it. It‚Äôs been 9 years. We know by now there is no strategy,CoachCrunch12,2025-04-23T16:28:12,11
"**From reporter Jillian Wilson:**  Most people grow out of name-calling by about the ninth grade ‚Äî maybe 12th grade if you‚Äôre particularly immature. By that time, you‚Äôre likely aware that calling someone names is mean, aggressive and not actually a good way to create a positive change in a relationship.  This can‚Äôt be said, though, for Donald Trump, who purposely name-calls (like when he labels his critics and opponents ‚Äúhaters,‚Äù ‚Äúfake,‚Äù ‚Äúbad people‚Äù or ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù).  Experts say this is a pointed strategy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs demagoguery is what he‚Äôs doing,‚Äù said¬†[Patricia Roberts-Miller](https://www.patriciarobertsmiller.com/), a professor emerita of rhetoric and writing who taught at the University of Texas at Austin.  There‚Äôs lots that goes into demagoguery, but to put it simply,¬†[it‚Äôs political rhetoric that uses emotions and prejudices](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demagogue)¬†to push forward an agenda.  It‚Äôs proven to be an effective strategy for Trump, but is a clear red flag in what it reveals about the way he leads and views others.

"Long, boring analytical article that tells us what is blatantly obvious -- Trump attacks people rather than responding to issues, he is a spoiled, dishonest, born-rich, amoral wannabe dictator who exploits the ignorance, racism, misogyny and xenophobia of approximately ¬Ω the voting population.",Nerd-19958,2025-04-23T16:47:09,6
