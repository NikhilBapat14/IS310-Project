"With any luck, this is the case that goes up the courts and gets this clearly unconstitutional ""law"" struck down.  If the 1st amendment protects corporations for the purposes of political speech and contributions (bribes) via Citizens United , it should equally apply to municipalities and private companies that do work with the state of Texas and no longer wish to support Israel.",DeathwingAdeptus,2025-04-30T16:16:12,5

"Considering that anti-bds laws haven't been found unconstitutional across the entire country, I don't know if it would be found unconstitutional, but I believe that it is unconstitutional, as I consider it to be compelled speech",Da_Malpais_Legate,2025-04-30T17:33:33,4
"Israel's corrupt PM Benjamin Netanyahu is a Trump boot licker.  Further, Israel is killing Muslims and Republicans love that.  Further, pacifying Muslims (up to and including murder) is necessary for the Second Temple to be built on the spot where Solomon's Temple and the Muslim holy site called Dome of the Rock now stands.  Why?  So that the Antichrist can make an appearance there and the Apocalypse can really get started.    Evangelical support for Israel is only for the purpose of fulfilling this prophecy from Revelation.  They don't care one iota for the Jews otherwise.  There's a reason why Evangelicals are called the Apocalyptic Death Cult.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-04-30T21:27:19,3
"This is 100% spot on. It seems most people don't know the true intentions of what is actually going and just seeing things on a surface level. The only disagreement I'd make is Trump is Netanyahu's bootlicker lol. But seriously, thank you for putting this comment out and hopefully help people who see it open their eyes to the extent of the true evil that is taking place in Palestine and Isreal",seekinenlightenment,2025-04-30T23:57:48,2
"The irony is that the Bible warns Christians not to do anything to accelerate the End Times, which the Evangelicals are doing.  It also says some Christians will be misled by False Prophets into following the Antichrist and doing his bidding.    Evangelicals have been promised a Rapture, but what they'll actually be getting is a hot bath in the lake of fire courtesy of a returned Jesus.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-01T00:26:04,1
