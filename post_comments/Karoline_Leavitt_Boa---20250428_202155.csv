That’s really the trouble with the idea of a modern civil war - it’s not really north and south anymore, it’s also a bit of rural versus urban, and educated versus not.   Even the reddest of red states have pockets of people living there who aren’t down with the Trump Train, and the opposite is also true. Those people are absolutely going to be the first victims of such a civil war, in part because low wages and lack of housing is a national crisis.",sepia_undertones,2025-04-29T04:58:28,8

I remember learning about our government at a young age and we all had so many ridiculous childlike questions about what if some leader wanted to outlaw spaghetti or whatever.   The teacher just kept telling us over and over how our Constitution was designed so brilliantly that no one would ever be able to get around it.   Those of us who were born here were *almost certainly* brainwashed and indoctrinated.

i do believe that republicans are inherently fighting against human rights and destroying our democracy but i don’t think the average joe is realistically okay with that. i think they’re just uninformed doesn’t make me sympathetic of them but i do believe that ppl can change with the right information if they’re willing to. republicans did irreparable damage to our country and caused a mass dem panic when democrats are the ones who fixes republicans messes.   i don’t think we should give up on ppl who are misinformed or brainwashed. again though don’t get it twisted they should be held accountable for rallying behind a man destroying our democracy. i have said many times over the republican party is done they will do what they’ve always done and change their party name and come back but only time will tell if people will just ignore that and stick with the right thing to do.,Akraxs,2025-04-29T14:27:53,2

"I don't know enough about the American system to have a good proposal, but I think they probably need to make some big changes to the constitution, though I know that's very difficult. An impeachment and conviction of Trump, as well as criminal conviction, probably needs to happen for the system to show it still works and that nobody is above the law and the constitution, though that too is difficult. Maybe some type of regulations should be put in place to prevent Fox, OAN, and alt. media from lying and spreading conspiracies to the extent they do, since they've causing half a country to stop living in reality entirely, but I'm weary of the potential impact on free speech.   I do know enough about democratic governments becoming authoritarian, like with Philippe Pétain, Hitler, Putin, Lenin, Mao, what's playing out now in Türkiye, and what was happening in Poland that the solution isn't to allow the authoritarian party or start arresting officials (especially judges), it never turns out well; you'll just lose even more rights and lose the parts of the system that were still functional.

"Totally agreed with all your points, but I’d go even further to say that the average person, not just Republicans, are at least somewhat uninformed either about current events or the way our country/government operates. Things like media company consolidation and the stripping of education, especially civics classes, in favor of standardized testing has contributed to that. Most citizens could be considered largely blameless for being as uninformed as they are, especially when a lot of them come from a time where you could mostly trust sources that present themselves as “news.”  Think about the average person who would say “I don’t really care for politics” prior to 2015 - that was a wildly common sentiment, and people would often admit their ignorance on the subject. Education and the media landscape hasn’t exactly gotten better since then - those people still exist, and the ones who have tried to change that have to educate themselves by wading through biased sources, which isn’t really an easy task when media literacy isn’t something that’s taught.  It’s hard to crawl out of the trenches when everything’s covered in mud.",dukeoftrappington,2025-04-29T16:09:26,2

Or 4 year old citizens with stage IV cancer. Seems like a natural next step for this administration, actually. And since they can do it without due process, nothing can stop them unless the military steps in. The same military which has had it's top generals and civilian leaders replaced with loyalists, with Trump himself as commander-in-chief.
