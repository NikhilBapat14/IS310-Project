Most republicans will always vote for their party rather than whoever is best for the job.,BrandinoSwift,2025-04-26T09:45:40,15
They voted to pwn the libs and cause pain to brown people. Why are they unhappy?,GrandFrogPrince,2025-04-26T09:36:07,6
But they'll keep supporting him because they're sniveling little coward babies.,incide666,2025-04-26T09:47:29,5
Yeah my sister voted for him because she thought he would reduce our taxes and get rid of illegals.   Now everyday he does something that directly fucks her over and she regrets her decision. She works a federal job. Has a ton of student loan debt that will now go to collections and ruin her DTI so she won’t be able to refi on her home. She said she feels lied to.,justamom2224,2025-04-26T09:42:19,6
The other half would eat dog shit if he told them to.,SlipNSlider54,2025-04-26T09:52:31,2

Are these polls useful? Because what the polls said before general election and the outcome are not relevant.,Justthetippliz,2025-04-26T09:45:24,0
May I ask how your sister believes “illegals” negatively affect her life?,pomonamike,2025-04-26T09:54:01,6
"Hell, they want grown men in girls restrooms to inspect their genitals so that no one (checks notes) touches those girls genitals? Um… that can’t be right. No that’s what it says here. Huh.",pomonamike,2025-04-26T09:56:18,3
"No idea. She is brainwashed. We in Ohio, not very diverse where she lives. Most of the crime where we are is committed by white guys, anyway.   She also used to work for JFS, and would talk shit about people on Welfare (even though she used it in the past). She agrees with him cutting it for some people. It makes me sick honestly. Help for me but not for thee. It reminds me why we aren’t close.",justamom2224,2025-04-26T10:06:52,6
She’s a bad person who wanted to hurt an out group. It’s not hard to grasp,Timely_Succotash_504,2025-04-26T11:00:56,5
Unfortunate for your situation. You have my empathy. I’ve got the same sister here in California. Her redneck ex husband hasn’t been paying support so she’s back on the welfare that god forbid People of Color may get.,pomonamike,2025-04-26T11:00:38,3
