">The report states that Arias-Cristobal does not have a driver's license, but she does have an international license, which her mother had taken from her. She was arrested by the officer and taken to the Whitfield County Jail before being transferred to the Stewart Detention Center – a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility – in Southwest Georgia.    Her own mother took her international driver's license away.  Why on Earth was she driving in the first place?    >Arias-Cristobal admitted to being in the U.S. illegally and does not have an application pending with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, according to DHS.    So she's a self-admitted illegal.  She must go.",vertigonex,2025-05-09T10:44:15,12
Her father is also in the same detention facility.  Dems should be happy that the family is not being separated.,Gringo-Bandito,2025-05-09T12:45:18,4
