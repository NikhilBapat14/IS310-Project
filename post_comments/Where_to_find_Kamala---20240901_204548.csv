"If I shared your concern about this, I would recommend diving into the growing literature surrounding strategic candidate/issue ambiguity. For some time now, most studies i’ve seen (see Glazer’s “The strategy of candidate ambiguity” back in 1990, Tomz and Houweling’s “The electoral implications of candidate ambiguity” in 2009, and there’s a ton of recent literature on it) suggest that ambiguity can be a winning strategy in elections. Candidates prioritize addressing some of the most popular proposals where necessary and play to their strengths, but increasingly avoid getting down to the details or addressing secondary or further issues.   Example: The Harris campaign will be vocally pro-choice since it’s a very popular position, but will almost certainly completely avoid issues with more division like the Israel-Palestine conflict. To the candidate, taking a hard stance on a divisive issue would needlessly isolate them from a significant chunk of votes. Similarly, there isn’t much incentive to lay out your exact plans for securing abortion rights past perhaps the most popular ideas to avoid the risk of losing pro-choice voters over differing strategy or policy details.  Strategic ambiguity isn’t isolated to one party (see Republicans reusing their 2016 platform in 2020 for example- they stuck with their top issues and ignored anything else) or the U.S. (there are some really solid papers in the EU especially, ex: Koedam’s “Avoidance, ambiguity, alternation: Position blurring strategies in multidimensional party competition” in 2021).  With all that said, I don’t share your concern however. Being the VP, her platform was her president’s platform. Now with her suddenly becoming the nominee, I wouldn’t have expected her to have a full page built out just yet. Might her campaign drag their feet on this if they continue to perform well without a platform webpage and given the benefits of such a strategy as discussed above? They might. But given the time constraint, I wouldn’t jump to strategic ambiguity as the main driver. Like others have, i’d suggest looking at the party’s platform as a default and look out for whatever major proposals she mentions directly that might deviate if you are interested in knowing more on her positions.",Philosophfries,2024-09-03T10:45:04,2

"She hasn't really gone out of her way to release a set of policies. More or less, she's in agreement with the official party platform as determined by Joe Biden. Her speeches so far indicate that she might be open to some minor modifications like being a bit less staunchly close to Israel, but nothing so very drastic.  There's not really a lot of benefit in her changing this, honestly. Even when folks are clamoring for a plan, often releasing a specific plan just tends to give people ammunition. Harris is riding high right now and there's enough out there as it is to understand where she is on key issues. Getting more nitty gritty and specific would be very unlikely to help her. So she hasn't.",mormagils,2024-09-03T11:10:56,1
