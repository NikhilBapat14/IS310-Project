"No matter how miserably I treat those Vets they still come back to me. They vote for me, they kiss my ring, they figuratively kiss my ass, they believe everything that I tell them about patriotism even though they know I got so many deferments for my bone spurs. I called one of their heroes a coward and a traitor who spent 7 years in Hanoi Hilton's worst prison and they still vote for me. I mocked them at the cemeteries in Europe and called them losers and suckers and they still vote for me. I went to Arlington National Cemetery and stood there and smiled with two thumbs up at the holiest site where nobody takes pictures and they still vote for me. Why should I change when they still vote for me?",TopEagle4012,2025-05-04T07:51:30,19
