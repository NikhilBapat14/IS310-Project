It's mainly the latter.   this is a race issue. this is a white supremacy issue.  this is not a existential threat to humanity, because the only way humanity will thrive for thousands of years to come is if we learn to manage our population so that we can manage our limited resources.  and dealing with a short term aging population is far easier to deal with then just continuing our surging population numbers and eat up the earth until there's nothing left.",Virbillion,2025-05-05T09:05:58,83

"From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com)  By Dana Gerber  Colleen Nguyen always thought she would have two children. Then she had her first.  She loves her son, Zach, a giggly 5-year-old with a penchant for sea creatures and Hot Wheels, and would love to give him a sibling. But the price tag of parenthood has far exceeded her expectations. These days, Zach’s nursery school and day care eat up anywhere from about $2,000 to $2,200 every month — not far from what she and her husband pay for the rent on their two-bedroom in Newton.  Between those bills and the copays on Zach’s health care — he has autism and a vision disorder — the thought of adding another child to the picture feels “practically impossible,” she said — especially if they were to ever try to afford to buy a house that could accommodate a growing family.  “It took me handing over the day care bills to my parents for them to understand,” Nguyen said. “They would just be like, ‘Oh, well, you can just have another one. It all works out. You can’t really just plan for them.’ And I‘m like, ‘No. Look at these numbers.’”  The Trump administration has made it clear it wants women to have more children, with [aides reportedly evaluating](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/us/politics/trump-birthrate-proposals.html)[ policy recommendations](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/05/business/trump-babies-fertility-rate-parenthood-cost-living-affordability/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) aimed at incentivizing higher fertility rates, from a $5,000 “baby bonus” when a mother gives birth to a “National Medal of Motherhood” for mothers with six or more kids. There are plenty of women in Massachusetts who would love to welcome the babies the White House covets — if only they could afford it.  The Globe spoke with more than 20 women who harbor an interest in starting or expanding their families, but feel they’ve been priced out of parenthood by the region’s sky-high cost of living — a stark financial reality they believe the ""[pronatalist](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/style/women-pronatalist-movement.html)"" policy recommendations flooding the White House are ill-equipped to handle.  “I would love to have a small baseball team of children,” said Tierney Elison, 38, a Winthrop mom of two and a midwife who feels she wouldn’t be able to afford the third child she and her husband envisioned. “I love being pregnant. I love giving birth. I love the newborn stage. I love watching the kids grow. But it is such a slog trying to make all of this work.”  “No amount of baby fever can overcome economic anxiety right now,” she added.",bostonglobe,2025-05-05T08:31:03,7

"“Even countries that have every imaginable incentive…” let me add to this point that merely having incentives is the wrong approach. A *lot* of these so-called “incentives,” as in the case of Hungarian and South Korean fertility programs, are just the government throwing up its hands and saying “okay, fine, I’m doing something! Happy?” instead of actually tuning these incentives to adequately compensate for the features of modern life that are lowering fertility rates, or better yet, addressing these problems at the root instead of hamfistedly trying to mitigate them after the fact.  The inescapable fact is that raising children is a massive time sink and that our current worldwide obsession with atomized nuclear families living in highly space-constrained and low-trust cities while the rate of single-income households has absolutely plummeted is not conducive to child-rearing. Particularly in an age where we have the deranged expectation that children are not to be left outdoors or unattended at any point before the age of 16.

The birthrate fell and fell until by the end of the century, more people were dying than being born some years and the population only grew thanks to immigration and longer lifespans. How? Delaying marriage, avoiding PIV sex, pulling out, and illegal abortions. None of these are ideal methods, but they'll lower the fertility rate from 4-7 births per woman to 1-3.

"Indeed, which is why wealthy people don’t tend to have all *that* many more kids, barring obvious outliers like Elon Musk. Often, both parents are still working at far higher rates than they were 50 years ago, and due to a variety of factors like Baumol’s cost disease, changing social and class structures, and the Western abandonment of multigenerational family housing, they still don’t have the kind of time or support necessary to have large families.   That, combined with an aging population, supports an obvious but unpalatable solution—grandparents, aunts, and uncles engaging in collective child-rearing, as had been the case for countless eons before the rise of urbanization, single-family homes, and suburbia. Historically speaking, due to things like disease and overcrowding, big cities were *universally* a population sink that was propped up by an influx of opportunity-seekers from the vastly more populous small towns and surrounding rural areas.  Today, though, 58% of the world population lives in cities, and that’s expected to rise to 68% in 2035. Cities *were* briefly able to grow populations in the early to mid 20th century due to better health standards, but rent-seeking, declining community trust and participation, lacking civic-mindedness, and artificial housing scarcity have all eroded that away. Cities no longer feel child-friendly or family-oriented. They are atomized, individualized. And that brings with it low fertility rates as sure as can be.",GrafZeppelin127,2025-05-05T11:43:01,9

But the vast vast vast majority of people who use fertility clinics are because they either have infertility (either female or male factor or both), or they cannot carry a child physically and are using a surrogate, or they are an LGBTQ+ couple who obviously can't conceive without donor egg or donor sperm, or they're someone about to go through a medical treatment like chemotherapy or having a testicle removed etc and they want to preserve their gametes for later fertility in case they are rendered infertile by their treatments.

"Communal and intrafamilial child-rearing rather depends on having a community or network of relatives/other parents around and convenient in the first place. I’m not talking about being entitled to labor, I’m talking about the alienating and inefficient consequences of separating each group of parents into their own isolated nuclear household, rather than allowing them to live in multigenerational housing and pool labor and resources efficiently as has been done throughout human history up until very recently.",GrafZeppelin127,2025-05-05T12:15:11,8

"Personally I think too much pressure is put on parents, particularly mothers.   Who wants that kind of burden, no village and all outcomes are placed solely on the shoulders of a nuclear family?   I always said I'd be more keen to have more children if I could be a 1950's dad. A modern day mother? It must feel like the weight of the world is on their shoulders. And the knowledge that their children might never be independent in today's world, and whatever mistakes they make are blamed on the parents.   It's just too much pressure, with so many downsides. I can't blame young people for taking a pass on parenthood.",Shapoopadoopie,2025-05-05T13:56:33,2

"I just wish parents would understand that their kids are \*their\* responsibilty and quit fantasizing about a mythical ""village."" The government \*is\* the village.

"I am also childfree and grew up being used as free child care, sacrificing much of my youth to raising other people's kids. I fully understand your concern, but I do also think it feels disingenuous to say that villages are mythical or somehow a burden.  Having a real, interconnected community that is invested in each other and cares for one another would be a lot less pressure on every individual. No, we shouldn't force Grandma to watch the kids, but in a healthy society Grandpa and Grandma should want to take the kids to their house every once in a while. Friends should want to build community with you and your family. You should be able to aks your neighbor for a cup of sugar if you run low in a pinch. We used to be able to trust in and rely on each other. Now we have an extremely isolated and I'd say selfish society where it seems ridiculous to say, ""Hey. Maybe we shouldn't leave people who do one of the toughest jobs on the planet to do it ALL by themselves"" and then wonder why we are all so burnt out and lonely.

"The idea of the government-as-the-village is incredibly harmful in and of itself, but it sure as hell won’t be productive to have that conversation with *you* of all people.",GrafZeppelin127,2025-05-05T12:26:05,7
"Villages are \*reciprocal\*.  In a real village, people are poor and they don't work for free, even if the exchange is barter or reciprocal services. Modern parents usually expect people to provide childcare without providing anything in return. There is absolutely nothing to stop modern parents from providing each other with reciprocal babysitting services. There is nothing to stop modern parents from doing things for Grandma (and it usually is Grandma, not Grandpa)  in return for Grandma providing babysitting services. There is nothing to stop modern people from making friends and many of them do. There is nothing to stop anyone from moving into an apartment building if they want more people around.  But  an emotional sense of community does not mean anyone has to provide free labor. As late as the 1960s or so, women were expected to spend their entire lives providing care. For their husbands, their children, their elderly parents, their elderly in-laws, sometimes younger siblings, and eventually elder care for husbands they usually outlived.  A modern Grandma already spent decades working for employers, quite possibly at some jobs she didn't really like. She also already brought up her own children. When she finally reaches retirement age, it's the first time in her life she's had time for herself. A short window before she is too old to do things for herself, the ones she's  dreamed about for many years. Also, probably a short window before she  starts providing elder care for her husband. Many women still do that. It's not even remotely selfish of Grandma to want to have time for herself.  With all this talk about ""community"" and ""people doing things for each other,"" parents always quickly boil down to it ""doing things for parents,"" and never the other way around. That's not a community, and it's massively selfish. I have no sympathy for people who voluntarily have  children, then whine about what a hard job it is and how burnt out and isolated they feel. Tough. Why should everyone else join you in working full time and then burning themselves out on \*your\* kids?  And yes, parents do have a village. The government and paid services have taken its place. They don't see their kids all day most days of the week as it is. Parents have to do some work for the lifestyle they voluntarily chose.  With over 8 billion people overpopulating the planet, parenthood is just a hobby that people can choose not to pursue. Grandma doesn't owe them jack.  Although, Grandma, Grandpa, Aunt, and Uncle can already babysit if they want to. Guess what, \*often they don't want to\*. A healthy society does not revolve around parents just because they are parents. Other people get to do what \*they\* want to do and just maybe, \*they\* are not isolated and lonely.  They don't want to come home tired from work and do someone else's childcare. If they feel lonely they can see friends who don't expect them to provide free labor.  We're all doing what we want to do already. If that doesn't suit the convenience of parents, too bad.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-05T13:53:54,1
"But that's exactly what the government does. Instead of families having all the burdens of childcare, education, supporting seniors, and much more, the government does those things to a large degree.  And it does them because it's a more efficient system. We're all paying taxes to support your kids, whether we have children or not, whether we currently have minor children or not. We're paying for your schooling, park playgrounds, etc. The burden is already shared.  Meanwhile, parents are a constant scream of ""more more for me me me.""",FormerUsenetUser,2025-05-05T12:28:47,0
"Yes, these parents chose to have children and they should bear the brunt of child rearing responsibility. I don't disagree there. And yes, these parents should also contribute to the communities they build via childcare or other services -- maybe they help with yard work for the elderly neighbors, maybe they host block parties and cookouts, maybe they volunteer to help with your taxes because they're good at it (something my grandmother,  who raised children on her own and never remarried after her husband died, did for her friends up until a few years before she passed).  Perhaps this is a personal feeling, but it seems to me we should all be invested in seeing the next generation come out as not only healthy and successful but compassionate people. We have to live in the world that generation will make, so why do we all exempt ourselves from helping guide them? That's what being part of a society used to mean.   And, as an aside, I don't think most people mean to literally conjure up an image of an impoverished village when we say we ""want a village"" of community. Your apartment complex could be a village. Small town main street used to be a village. If we had more walkable cities and actually interacted with each other more than just during our bouts of road rage, we might not be so disconnected from that reality.   Lastly, villages have been disappearing when people have kids in ways that don't require child rearing services. I've noticed people just slink away from their friends once those friends have kids, as if the parents cease to be people once they reproduce. They dont call, they dont come over for dinner. Have you ever considered that pushing parents into forced isolation may be one cause of that pendulum swinging so far to the other side when the parents need a break? Perhaps our desire to not only be childfree but to somehow manifest a child-less reality is part of the cuase for the selfishness you've witnessed? Again, food for thought.",hardly_trying,2025-05-05T14:06:05,2

"Parents never talk about doing anything for anyone else in their community. And not having children, and not taking care of other people's, doesn't mean society is childless. There are many ways to contribute to society, including by doing paid work that does not involve children.  People drop friendships with parents because most parents talk of nothing but their kids, expect every gathering to include their kids, and then wander around expecting everyone else to care for their kids.  Parents expect the world to revolve around them and their kids. Who needs that? When you've become a jerk, people don't want to be around you. There's a reason people drop friendships with parents.  I am 70, and my husband is 73. We are very happy with no kids in our lives, \*ever\*, and that's exactly how we want it. I don't care what  parents want. They brought this on themselves. They can teach their kids to be compassionate.  I really, truly have no interest in kids. We even quit going to restaurants where parents let their kids run feral, running, screaming, and shouting all over the place, around the indoor tables.  The parents aren't parenting. Why should anyone else bother?  We did the best thing we could ever do for the environment by not contributing to overpopulation.  My husband was a groundbreaking R  & D scientist (before retirement). I write books. We are also political activists. That's all about the future. The future doesn't have to be all about or mostly about kids.  And I am not responsible for anyone else's, just because they chose to have them.  Let people do what they want instead of complaining that they don't take care of other people's kids.  They'll do what they want anyway.  You can't force them to provide free childcare.
