">“[Donald Trump ](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump/)and [Elon Musk ](https://thehill.com/people/elon-musk/)think this country belongs to them,” the movement’s [website](https://handsoff2025.com/) states. “They’re taking everything they can get their hands on, and daring the world to stop them. On Saturday, April 5th, we’re taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands off!”   >The protesters have three main demands: an end to the “billionaire takeover and rampant corruption” of the Trump administration; an end to cuts in federal funding for Social Security, Medicare and other programs that working people rely on; and an end to attacks on immigrants, trans people and other communities.   >The website states that the country is facing a “national crisis” with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid under threat, protections for workers being stripped and community members like immigrants, transgender individuals and political opponents being targeted. ",YallerDawg,2025-04-04T12:29:02,12
