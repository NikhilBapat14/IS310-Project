"He's been losing his whole life. The problem is he's a very slowly-collapsing neutron star that feeds itself by ripping and tearing at everything and anything around it until all that's left is vacuous destruction.  Of course he'll eventually lose. This fat incompetent slob isn't going to rule over a thousand-year reich. He can barely rule his own diaper.   I don't care if he loses, I know it is inevitably he *will* lose. The issue is the damage he does as he collapses in on himself. That's what needs to concern all of us.",StoppableHulk,2025-04-30T10:54:45,2134
"Well, as much as I love the so-called ""liberal media"", this is just the kind of bullshit they love to feed us to placate us and make us feel better about the fact that the United States is at this moment under the rule of a tyrant.  Media has been saying some version of ""the Republican Party is crumbling..."", ""these are the death throes of White Supremacy,"" ""oh... Trump is losing"" since 2016.   Trump is NOT losing. He's gaining power, and he will not stop until he is stopped by someone. That's how this ends, hopefully sooner rather than later.",ExpressionGuilty6391,2025-04-30T11:33:34,504

Why does America need to “learn” that the least qualified president ever, who has already failed dozens of times and been found criminally liable for fraud, the guy who staged a coup after losing an election, is going to be an absolute shit show and further weaken democracy?  Why does any of this need to happen?  So he’s losing now… great. This is information we already had. We knew this is how it would go. But now he gets to destroy the country anyways. Now he gets to destroy democracy from within. Now he gets to attack the judiciary. Now he gets to control the military and try to use it on America soil.  Why?

"When people tell me that Trump is losing, or that it's all over for Republicans in 2028 ... IDK. I can't be the only one who notices that if you are were a high flying Phd candidate and are now rotting in a South American prison, or if you are were a decently paid Federal Worker and are now unemployed. It would be hard to convince me if I were any of the thousands of people whose lives will never be the same again that Trump is losing.   In 100 days we have come to dread each new dawn like a Vampire dreads daybreak. Even if Trump keeled over tomorrow he has given Conservative Christians the kill switch for Democracy. Trumps stamp is all over what is happening, but dozens of Conservative Facists have crafted the culture of cruelty that is currently carving up Democracy like a Thanksgiving Turkey, and they don't plan to go anywhere.   Give me ANY sign that this nightmare is anywhere close to being over on its own. ANY sign. I am reminded of a former acquaintance whose life partner was waylaid by an affair with another and left to move in with them. I heard endlessly about how badly that was going to go for the homewrecker and they would have their partner back and how sweet it was going to be to see their devastated face when the mighty hand of God smacked them down for their perfidy.  It never happened. The illicit relationship endured until old age took one of them, by which time I was long out of touch with the one that had been wronged. All of you that are waiting for Trumps demise and think it will happen without US (all of us) doing unthinkable, unspeakable and unspeakably brave things to bring it about, are just mouthing nonsense.

But he has coupled that luck with extraordinarily bad lifetime decision making that *requires* that luck to begin with.  So it was exceedingly lucky he inherited 700 million dollars from his dad. But then through extremely bad and obvious decision-making, he lost almost all of it. And then, a bunch of producers on a TV show thought it would be funny to put the wrost businessman they'd ever seen as the host of a busness-themed reality show.   That, inexplicably, made hundreds of millions of Americans believe he *was* a good businessman, and started turning his abysmal financial situation around.   And when he was trying to launch a book and running for POTUS mostly as a publicity tour, that fame actually turned a ridiculously imoprobably presidential campaign into a reality.   But *that* led to Russia having him by the balls (they'd been slowly squeezing long before that, but this really escalated it), and that led to Trump being impeached twice and trying to coup the government.   That *almost* led him to prison, until he once again defied all odds to become POTUS yet again, a job which it is important to remember he hates, but whch he now needed to do simply to stay out of a tiny cell.  Even the elections he's involved in. Everyone *around* Trump does terribly. When he isn't involved in an election, Republicans do awful. In 2018 they suffered catastrophic losses, because he wasn't on the ballot.  There is something about him, very specifically, that almost warps probability. The polls are consistently wrong *but only about him*. He should have, by all apparent math, lost 2024 badly, and he didn't. I'm not going to say whether there was cheating or not. I don't know. But he does somehow, repeatedly, defy all rational predicted outcomes.   I mean I guess to sum up, if you nearly got shot in the head, would you say you were lucky?

"I literally looked this up because of your comment and hadn't heard of it.  That's absolutely insane. 4.7 million votes denied in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia... 3.2 million new voters were declined or not processed in time...  That's outrageous. 2.1 million mail in votes decided just for minor errors like postage?  So much for the GOP actually having its first popular vote win in over 20 years. They just manipulated the system in their favor.

"The bar is literally ""Did the democrats show up"".  The Democrats show up, you win, and this time the Democrats stayed home.   Everyone knows how easy it is to get Democrats fighting, and y'all fall for it every time.    I disagree with my fellow Libertarians (in any days that end with y), but me disagreeing with them over a complex international situation we're only indirectly part of?       I'm not going to declare them a monster or a politician as someone I couldn't vote for.  Meanwhile, the Republicans know that if they get an earworm in the dumbest democrat's brain, they can create an army of 'useful idiots' who will sap the Democrat's strength.

"Per my previous statement: ""If you could focus on \*not\* trying to cull your own voters before election day, you would have done MUCH better.""  I mean, I \*could\* view Democrats as ""People who want to bitch and pass the buck (of throw money at the problem in mass quantities) instead of actually investing into actually looking at the causes of the problems..."", or ""We will keep tacking on laws and adlibbed policies and never clean up their legal messes and then blame people for not trusting us when we can't explain our own shit,""  But, unlike you, I don't view demeaning another's point of view down to a strawman as useful in any way.  I am not a Democrat because while I agree with the Social \*desires\* of Democrats, I feel the Democratic efforts are counter productive and often lead to hurting the causes they support because they do not connect with people and fail to try to convince people on the fence as a organization.  I feel that if they tried, they could probably trim down and simplify much of what they wanted into community action (like they did with gay rights, arguing through the courts) instead of laws that will eventually be turned against those same goals.  P.S.   Reposted from two posts down:   To cut off your performative outrage and pedantic that I \*dare\* be a Libertarian:   Yes I believe in local services like Fire Departments and Roads,   I believe that pedophiles should be in jail,   I believe that we all have social responsibilities and that we live in a society and all that,  But I believe that a tax code should be simple enough that the average person should be able to figure it out in a afternoon without paying people, and that the government's goals should be direct, straightforward, and limited in both scope and executive authority.  Because eventually in any government there will be a Lord North / Donald Trump / Chairman Mao / Stalin, and good intentions and 'tradition' won't be enough to stop them.  So maybe, MAYBE, \*we should stop giving politicians power BEFORE a Trump Figure Takes Power.\*  That is what I mean by Libertarian.",Triple_M_OG,2025-05-01T12:22:30,0
