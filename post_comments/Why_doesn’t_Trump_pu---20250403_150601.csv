Russia can‚Äôt put tariffs on themselves,ChainNormal8827,2025-04-03T15:16:03,226
"Two words: Putin's puppet.  The [official explanation](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/business/economy/russia-us-tariffs-trump.html) according to the White House, is that tariffs on Russia weren't necessary because economic sanctions have reduced trade to nearly zero. Except that sanctions haven't reduced trade to nearly zero. In fact, the US has done more trade with Russia than with Ukraine. Yet, Ukraine and [the penguins of Antarctica](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-antarctica-uninhabited-heard-mcdonald-islands) are being subjected to 10% retaliatory tariffs.",Dazzling-Finding-602,2025-04-03T15:43:44,142

"There are already tons of sactions against them trade declined from 35 billions to 3 billions . Everything is either banned or with already 35% tarrif       Before the 2022 invasion, U.S.-Russia bilateral trade was significant, peaking at approximately $35 billion in 2021. The sanctions imposed since February 2022 have drastically reduced this figure:  * Trade Decline: By 2023, bilateral trade had dropped to around $3 billion to $3.5 billion, representing a decline of roughly 90% from pre-invasion levels. Posts on X and various analyses consistently cite this range, reflecting the sharp reduction.  Import Bans: Beyond energy, the U.S. banned imports of Russian diamonds, seafood, uranium, metals (e.g., steel and aluminum), and other goods. A 35% tariff was also imposed on certain Russian imports not fully banned.  Oil and Gas Import Bans: In March 2022, Executive Order 14066 banned the import of Russian crude oil, petroleum products, liquefied natural gas, and coal into the U.S. This was a significant step, as energy exports are a cornerstone of Russia‚Äôs economy.     Price Cap on Russian Oil: In December 2022, the U.S., alongside the G7 and other allies, implemented a $60-per-barrel price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil. This policy allows Western service providers (e.g., shipping and insurance companies) to facilitate Russian oil trade only if sold below the cap, aiming to reduce Russia‚Äôs revenue while maintaining global oil supply stability.  * Blocking Sanctions: The U.S. has targeted major Russian financial institutions, including Sberbank, VTB Bank, and others, freezing their assets in the U.S. and prohibiting U.S. persons from dealing with them. Over 2,500 Russia-related targets, including individuals, entities, vessels, and aircraft, have been added to OFAC‚Äôs Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List since February 2022. * Central Bank Restrictions: In February 2022, the U.S. prohibited transactions with the Central Bank of Russia, effectively freezing over $300 billion in Russian foreign exchange reserves held in Western jurisdictions. * SWIFT Disconnection: Several Russian banks were removed from the SWIFT international payment system, severely limiting their ability to conduct global transactions.",SnooMemesjellies5491,2025-04-03T15:38:15,2
