I fully agree Harvey was a shit as human being.   He was constantly rude and ugly to anyone that could not make him a bundle of money.    But it is my opinion that the actresses willingly agreed to play around with him because they thought he could make them famous or get them an Oscar.   It was nothing more than quid pro quo.,old---,2025-05-05T08:39:59,-1
