Trump has never been responsible for his actions.  From childhood to the present he gets away with it all.  I hate him with a passion for trampling over everything this nation ever stood for.,Intrepid_Blue122,2025-04-13T21:38:51,17

You really do have a very strange ‚Äòjustice‚Äô system where people at the top can break laws so openly with absolutely no consequences. Can‚Äôt help but think we are seeing the beginning of the end of the once mighty US of A. How long before being a democrat is enough to get you sent to a death camp? At this pace it will be well before you reach the mid terms üòû,rically95,2025-04-13T21:25:50,10

"I'm advocating for a mass protest where we put our flags upside down. Tomorrow morning I'm putting mine up upside down, I hope all who see this follow suit and spread the word.   The current state of our country is unacceptable, we must show courage in our opposition to this tyranny, show them that we are here, and that America is in distress. I encourage all those who see this to follow suit and spread the idea to put our flags upside down. Now is the time to show them that we will not hide away, we will not accept this fascism, even if it's as simple as putting a flag out upside down. The little things matter, they show others that they are not alone in their opposition, and that something is wrong with our country. Please follow suit.  https://www.americanflags.com/blog/post/when-can-you-fly-the-american-flag-upside-down?srsltid=AfmBOoq5-21apenGOUZRTnPyALufClJulHTg1T22HxhU-O_mzjSi2H8j",Insane_Salty_Potato,2025-04-14T20:30:33,1
