"A few things.  1. The super PAC point is moot in presidential elections.  Trump has been very outspent in every election he’s been in, and it doesn’t seem to make much difference.  Corporate-interest donors are a thing, but they’re not nearly as relevant as you think.  There’s a *ton* of billionaire donors who clearly aren’t in it for profit, and if anything just happen to be ideologues who have a ton of money.  And there’s plenty of billionaires who fund progressives (Steyer, Bloomberg, Soros).  There’s also very limited evidence that Super PAC money is relevant.  The campaigns that rely on Super PAC’s instead of their own campaigns (where donations are capped) tend to do very poorly.  There’s just so much small-dollar money in politics right now on both the left and right that getting a giant influx of Super PAC money isn’t actually a big difference-maker.  2. You’re obviously correct that Democrats have lost non-college working class people, but I think your analysis is off.  From a *policy* perspective, the Democratic Party’s leadership is more progressive than ever.  Obama governed to Clinton’s left economically.  Hillary Clinton ran on an economic agenda to Obama’s left.  Biden governed in a much more progressive way than Obama, and moreso than Hillary proposed. Biden catered to unions in ways no Democrat had done, pushed climate-related spending no Democrat had ever proposed.  The Build Back Better bill went way further than anything that any other Democratic president would have done.  But it was Bill Clinton who put up the best numbers with working class voters, by a mile. He was more *moderate* than the previous two Democratic nominees (Dukakis and Mondale), but did way better among non-college voters.  Today, non-college voters disassociate from Democrats not because of their policy proposals, but because of a feeling that the party is not interested in them *despite* those policies.  Democrats are the party of progressive activist groups, who are quite out of touch with actual working class people.  Their rhetoric is alienating.  The vibes are all wrong.  Their priorities seem pointless.   Proposing yet another massive transfer of wealth, or a bigger welfare state, does not solve this.  Democrats need to stand up to the unpopular elements of their own coalition.",ReElectNixon,2024-11-13T20:03:04,7

"Completely disagree- it wasn’t policy that lost the election, it was an overall pessimistic outlook across the country accelerated by both mass media and social media, inflation, and honestly a complete disconnect between the collectivist goals of progressivism and the individualist viewpoint of the average American. People don’t want to cure homelessness by giving everyone a home, they want them to be removed. People don’t want to fix the root cause of uncontrolled integration, they want them gone. Stop assuming the general public thinks like you, they don’t. Instead message good policy as a solution to their individualist wants.",shapptastic,2024-11-13T06:56:04,12
The Democrats put out policies much more beneficial to the working class than Republicans. Democrats need to do a better job of messaging to the working class though on a cultural level.

They say they are for the people, and in the meantime their corporate donors have bought up 83% of the homes in the U.S… they claim to be for the people, but the actions of those behind them display nothing but greed.

"I agree on messaging, but that’s actually where Bernie excels in terms of broad working class appeal, even in rural areas. Hammering home the message of tangible progress undercuts right wing propaganda. Raising federal minimum wage, legalization of marijuana on a federal level, going after price gouging, and enshrining access to birth control are popular.   Unfortunately, as we’ve now learned twice, those policies are more popular when they come from the mouth of an old angry white man than an even-keeled, overqualified woman.",ManChildMusician,2024-11-13T08:50:06,1

"I think they should step back from cultural issues and avoid following the Republican approach, especially on topics like trans rights. They could simply say, 'We believe families should make their own decisions, doctors should make decisions based on their expertise and their patients’ needs, and leagues should set their own rules about participation. It’s not our role to police behavior in these areas, and it shouldn’t be any party’s policy to do so. If you’re against abortion, don’t get one. It’s that simple. We’re here to improve everyone’s standard of living, to ensure families have food on the table, and to guarantee they can see a doctor when they need one.'  In my view, they focus on cultural issues to distract from their reluctance to make meaningful economic policy changes.

"Your telling me that in a polarized political climate that Republicans somehow convinced fences sitters and lower class hispanics who voted for dems all of a sudden dems are bad? This happened since 2016 and everyone bought it when biden came to power, now somehow they dint? The messaging has always been the same for dems that Trump is bad and republicans always said that dems would bring immigrants. It has nothing to do would messaging voters are jusy tired of culture politics when they realized money was going down.  Even if trump is a sporadic maniac they benefitted from the economy under him, they felt more money in their pockets, almost all voters this election stated that economy and immigration where the biggest issues.   Plus, noting that there are a plethora of news channels contributing to left wimg meesaging I find this super hard to believe.  Its simple the actual reason is People got fed up of culture politics when they realized dems dint make things any better nobody tangibly felt change, this was the opposite effect of trumps reign where every survey revealed people actually felt his policies put into action. Which is why electoral votes were closer before than now.  Dems biggest mistake was losing bernie who understood class politics and actual working class issues, Republicans with Trump already knew this.  Even AOC supporters moved for trump she even posted stories on it, there is no message here poeple have been hearing everything sonce thw begenning now they jsut needed to feel policy change which never happened under Biden/Kamala, the fact that they suffered by losing the house, senate and executive was ample evidence  Trump gained in almsot every demographic this year, democrats have to quite establishment politics and get back on roots.",yourdaddy4lyf,2024-11-13T10:41:02,2

But do you have any examples of big campaign promises from Democrats that they didn’t either accomplish or were prevented from accomplishing by Republicans? I’m genuinely curious here.  I can certainly think of things Democrats have wanted to do that haven’t happened, but always because the Senate can’t pass non-tax/spend legislation without 60 votes, or because Republican-appointed judges have blocked.

Personal life and ethics aside, Trump managed to market horse dewormer, internal UV lights and bleach as viable treatments for Covid. The same information from different sources has different results. Being able to suggest and market completely illogical treatments is a different level of zeal. It’s batsh*t crazy, and it’s hard to combat.  Dems needed to tap into the power of latent rage.

"First of all, why shouldn't they? She said that all prison inmates should have access to gender affirming care in prison. Prisoners can't have private medical insurance in prison since they can't work and have no income, therefore all of their medical needs must be paid by the state. Gender affirming care is a necessity for many trans people, thus, the prison should be required to offer that care. Also the amount that taxpayers pay for gender affirming care for inmates is a miniscule fraction of a cent. If taxpayers are concerned with how their taxes are spent on inmates they should be wondering why prisons are so over crowded rather than an uncommon operation that a fraction of trans people who are a small fraction of the prison population get.  Secondly, she didn't talk about this issue at all on the campaign trail. It was brought up by Republicans who are the kings of identity politics. How is any Dem going to avoid identity politics when the identity politics are always brought up by pearl clutching Republicans who are afraid of LGBT folks? If it's not trans prisoners, it's X candidate has a nonbinary relative and they respect their pronouns. Republicans have such a low bar with respect to identity politics that you cannot avoid it.  Thirdly, if we are ""avoiding identity politics"" or ""wokeness"" are we now just abandoning LGBT folks because they make Republicans uncomfortable? How can we justify not standing up for them?
