I’m going to fuss at you about the paywall. Not because I don’t think you deserve to be paid for your work; I absolutely believe journalists should be paid for their work. Hell I used to subscribe to your print service more than a decade ago. But rather because I do not want to have to pay for a subscription that I’ll inevitably forget I have or underutilize. Moreover that I’ll pay for the article and still be inundated with advertisements and trackers… it’s frustrating,AVGuy42,2025-05-09T06:39:31,7
