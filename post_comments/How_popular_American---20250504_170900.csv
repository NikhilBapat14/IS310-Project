There really aren’t any libertarians in America these days. Anyone claiming to be libertarian in America now is just a MAGA Republican who isn’t quite MAGA enough (yet) to just admit they’re MAGA,Weak-Elk4756,2025-05-04T21:58:29,15
"In one sense, libertarianism is or just was flourishing in the USA, and that is if you see it as the chief expression of Silicon Valley politics. For some time the cry there has been to end govt, end politics, and replace it with Internet-centric techno-solutionism. Peter Thiel and company are currently having their say in the Trump admin. and in many ways are lined up with his most extreme pronouncements on Am politics as in T's willingness to erase all slow pol procedures and can the Constitution, Voting, civil rights, legal rights, and institute a sweeping new form of imperialism as in quick strikes, quick ownership.",fxkatt,2025-05-04T18:23:29,8

Trump is just another oligarch like Putler. But too old and too stupid.    USA is killing itself by hunting short term profits over long term customer relations. Gives short term bonus to managers and kills companies. Boeing went from good to worst in a few years.   So USA has passed the line of good liberalism and went too far into profit maximizing for the mafia. Aka oligarchy.,povlhp,2025-05-04T23:57:07,3

"In France, the last libertarian party (which was called Démocratie Libérale) dissolved in 2002, and its founder Alain Madelin only got 4% of the vote at the presidential election of that time, so you can say it is extremely unpopular.   This doesn’t stop the French Left from always accusing their center-right opponents (such as Macron) of being libertarians (or neoliberals), even though Macron keeps intervening in the economy through subventions and regulations and is actually very Keynesianist (but less so than the French Left). It reminds me of the way the U.S. Republicans will always accuse the U.S. Democrats of being communists even when it makes absolutely no sense.",NekoCatSidhe,2025-05-07T04:28:52,2
"Javier Milei was elected out of desperation indeed.  In the same way as Duterte in the Philippines and Bukele in El Salvador were elected.  the Philippines and El Salvador had problems with crime that were too great for the main parties to handle, so, they elected the Opposite to GET THE JOB DONE.   Term limited dictators, in effect, human rights taking a back seat. But the people had had enough and we Starbucks drinking, McDonalds eating, Netflix watching, Reddit bitching privileged westerners have no conception whatsoever.  In the case of Argentina - the economy was a complete shitshow. 100% inflation. The government printing money to give make work jobs. A housing sector in shambles.  However, Argentina used to be RICH. As a country it is blessed with natural resources, a good climate, an educated people, and a safe environment.  The burden of socialist government **ran badly** (unlike the Nordic countries) gave Milei his mandate to slash with a chainsaw.

"Libertarianism is fantasy nonsense. Generally speaking it’s popular with people who are wealthy and think they should be able to do whatever they want and the uneducated who are to ignorant to understand how things actually work.   If you eliminate government, which would be the ultimate goal of libertarianism, some other construct would just end up stepping in to take its place. In America it would most likely be a religion. ",Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-07T06:15:54,1
"In the UK Liz Truss became Prime Minister in September 2022 after a leadership contest in the Conservative party. On the 23rd of September 2022 her Chancellor introduced a 'mini-budget' including a large number cuts to income taxes and National Insurance and rollbacks of other planned tax increases, heavily influenced by free-market think tanks such as the IEA, for which she refused to have the Office for Budget Responsibility do the typical economic forecast for major legislation.  Economists panned it, the markets panicked, the pound dropped precipitously and kept dropping, mortgage products were being cancelled and it turned out that the Bank of England hadn't known about the budget beforehand which made matters worse when they raised interest rates. A week after the mini-budget large parts of it were rolled back, the Chancellor was fired, and despite struggling on Liz Truss resigned as Prime Minster three weeks later on the 20th of October.  That's the high point of libertarianism in the UK, I don't think even the Tories will be embracing anyone from that wing of the party for a long time to come.  https://www.newsweek.com/how-liz-truss-libertarian-experiment-crashed-burned-uk-1753884  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_United_Kingdom_mini-budget#The_budget",OMalleyOrOblivion,2025-05-09T04:27:34,1

"It's a very large tent with Left and Right leaning libertarians.  There are four large problems    No 1 is that it caters to conspiracy theories.  No 2 it's heavy on theory and woefully inadequate with regards to practical application.   No 3 many of the adherents are hypocritical in how they think a libertarian society should be formed.   No 4 its theories run up against human nature.    Humans are lazy and consequently are always looking for the ""easy button"" when it comes to problem solving.

"Maybe, but not case here.  Svetov is maga lite. These days he hardly ever talk about libertarian things like anarcho-capitalism. You can find pictures of him in maga hat, he is larping conservative, russian nationalist, low key racist/xenophobe, he is friends with American magas and maga adjacent people.    That's not the main reason the statement was made though. He is just so meme-y. He employs unhealthy amount of mentally hymnastics, and he is so hypocrite, it's just so funny. For example he is all about conservative traditional values and russian nationalism, but he is almost 40 y.o. living with his 20 something y.o. girlfriend in Brasil. No children, no marriage, very conservative. In russian Internet politics he earned the nickname ""fucking degenerate""  Edit I should have said, I was only talking about Svetov, there are actually two libertarian parties in russia, and even in the one aligned with Svetov there is a lot of different libertarians with very different stances.",disharmonic_key,2025-05-05T03:28:04,3
">Humans are lazy and consequently are always looking for the ""easy button"" when it comes to problem solving.   That easy button can resemble technological advancements or plunder of another person's property.  I firmly believe that's capitalism's fault, not human nature.  We've bred humans to want to do the minimal work possible to achieve advanced wealth and then sit on it. In an ideal society, everyone works together as a community to provide needs to one another. True individualism breeds adversarialism and stifles compassion and empathy.   But we probably just fundamentally disagree on this, as I am a left libertarian/anarchocommunist, not a right one. I grew up as a right libertarian, though, and I both understand the mindset and even somewhat sympathize with it to some degree.
