Neither that traitor nor her family deserve anything.,Nakuull,2025-05-02T14:37:45,83

">Hours after he was inaugurated, the president issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants. The Justice Department has fired prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 cases.      >Last month, Brendan Ballou, one of the Jan. 6 prosecutors who resigned after Trump took office told CBS News the pardons and firings were an effort to whitewash history.     >""The goal here is to rewrite the history of Jan. 6,"" Ballou said. ""There are enormous number of politicians whose whole careers now depend on that day being forgotten because if it's remembered, people will realize they are supporting a president that tried to incite an insurrection and overthrow the peaceful democratic transfer of power. And so there's a concerted effort by these folks to make sure that that history is forgotten, and firing those prosecutors is part of that effort.""",squintytoast,2025-05-02T14:57:36,9
