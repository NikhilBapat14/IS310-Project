"PBS may as well use the little time they have left to just mercilessly hammer in as much as possible how fucked the US is unless something is done about the orange protein stain.  ...But man, I'm genuinely bummed that PBS Space Time is gonna be gone soon. :< Hopefully Matt will find a new gig and quickly.",TheRustFactory,2025-05-03T00:06:55,10
"As a regular PBS viewer I am confident in saying they are aggressively neutral in giving Trump the benefit of the doubt regardless of whatever stupid shit he does. Portraying anything but praise for dear leader is a step too far for this admin though.   Also, David Brooks is a fucking idiot and if anyone wants a good laugh look up David Brooks 78 dollar lunch",longtermattention,2025-05-03T02:13:58,6

"PBS ain't going anywhere. Last night Chris Hayes did a segment on MSNBC about how the republicans have been trying to eliminate it for the past 50 years, but the big problem is that viewers like it! So congress will ignore Trump's symbolic executive order and keep on funding it just as they have before.",edmerx54,2025-05-03T00:44:51,11
