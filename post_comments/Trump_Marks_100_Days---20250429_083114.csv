"Honestly, it's just confusing that President Trump managed to sign so few bills into law during his initial 100 days, and when you consider the sheer number of people he pardoned, around 1,500, charged over storming the Capitol, it really does make you wonder, doesn't it just show the dysfunction and disregard for the rule of law? I mean, how can anyone really claim this was a successful first 100 days, it's just... incredible, really.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-29T08:38:57,1
"If you realize that Trump is a Russian controlled asset then everything, he has been doing makes sense.   Putin has told him to destroy America from within, and he has been doing his darndest to achieve that goal.   Round up people and destroy the constitution, causing chaos in the streets. That's a Russian goal  Destroy the American economy with chaotic implementation of tariffs, a Russian goal.  Fire government employee's so that entire departments can no longer function correctly, this achieves a Russian goal.   Place incompetent people in control of the CIA, and the defense department, so that intel can easily be leaked over public chat groups. I am not sure if Trump planned that exactly, but it sure worked out for Russian intelligence gathering.   We have 4 more years of this traitor dictating Russian commands, and we are going to see even more of our country be destroyed.  100 days feels like a life time.",FreshRest4945,2025-04-29T09:07:28,1
