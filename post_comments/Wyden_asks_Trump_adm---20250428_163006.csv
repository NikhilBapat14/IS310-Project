"What policies? The rules on paper don't mean anything if ""ICE gets an unlimited number of oopsie daisies"" is the unwritten policy. Most of the awful things they've done lately were already banned by *policy.*",pervocracy,2025-04-28T16:34:23,27
How long until the Olympic games are moved?,MentalTourniquet,2025-04-28T16:34:10,17
They should all boycott the US.,Weird-Ad7562,2025-04-28T16:53:27,12
America is a hazardous destination and should be avoided by international travelers.  The authoritarian regime is unpredictable and dangerous.  You could end up in prison for weeks or longer here on a whim.   Having the World Cup or the Olympics in the US makes as much sense as letting North Korea or Russia host these games.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-28T17:03:19,11

Anytime anyone asks Trump to do something the result will be him not doing it 100% of the time.,bassplayerguy,2025-04-28T17:40:48,2

"It won't be moved, foreign tourists/athletes just won't show up. Same with the US based games during the World Cup.",Infamous-Sky-1874,2025-04-28T16:37:21,15
A good idea of what will happen is to watch who actually shows up for the Prefontaine Classic in Oregon this July.  It's one of the largest track and field events in the US with people from all over the world showing up. Probably part of the reason Wyden is especially trying to get this ironed out.,ianrl337,2025-04-28T16:55:48,15
They wont move although if Trump continues down this path of fascism its possible some countries may consider boycotting the games. Honestly i think maybe they should,sedatedlife,2025-04-28T17:24:20,6
"Honestly probably true. The country is rich enough to keep it here, but poor enough in character for it not to matter.",watcherofworld,2025-04-28T16:51:37,6
They should both be moved.  People should feel safe traveling to see the Olympics or the World Cup.  That can not happen with radical rigjt wingTrump regime.,Beantown-Jack,2025-04-28T17:07:21,7
