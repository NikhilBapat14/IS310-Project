"I'm not sure where you got the idea that we're not avoiding direct confrontation with China.  We have been tiptoeing around a number of sensitive issues of foreign policy since the Nixon administration, and we continue to do so to this day.",Blear,2023-03-07T20:06:21,17
"I would say we are. Just what your idea, my idea or our current leaders ideas on what counts as avoiding may all be different.   Just like Ukraine situation. Even amongst those who are all aboard helping Ukraine may have differing ideas on exactly how, how much ,how long and so on.  And to each, the other ideas look like we arent trying, are trying too much and so on.",[deleted],2023-03-07T21:17:47,7
"Cold Wars have demonstrated great expense, great cost and distraction, potentially great losses and opportunity costs, to win ideological battles over decades and usually by proxy in places those countries donâ€™t prioritize anyway. Sane people avoid costly wastes of money for as long as possible, and especially direct conflict.",[deleted],2023-03-07T20:07:07,3
"Why is it up to the west to avoid confrontation?  A lot of the growing tensions between the west and China are due to the fact that China under Xi is a lot more belligerent and hostile than it was in the past.  A good example of this is the Taiwan situation, where China has started openly it is prepared to use force against Taiwan.",Naliamegod,2023-03-07T21:32:11,3
"I'm not sure I accept the premise. What do you mean by ""not doing anything to avoid direct confrontation?"" Can you explain the details of this a little better? It seems to me like you're taking exception to the US using diplomacy to pursue US goals and objectives, which isn't a very reasonable criticism.",mormagils,2023-03-08T08:49:44,3
Because it's in their economic interest to have a confrontation with China.  A lot of people with a lot of connections have a shitton of money invested in companies like Apple or Samsung. Do you think they are happy if their marketshare loses to a Chinese smartphone? And you can extend this to any other product.,Hapsbum,2023-03-10T05:52:28,2
"Oh boy, an IR question, buckle up bud, here we go.  The US and USSR had very few *direct* confrontations in the Cold War. They were mostly short lived stand-offs like the crisis at Checkpoint Charlie and the Cuban Missile Crisis (along with a handful of aerial engagements in various wars), but the aim was to avoid direct confrontation wherever possible because of the risk of nuclear escalation. What actually was going on was a whole buttload of proxy wars where the US and USSR were trying to put their guys in charge of key nations either for positioning reasons (e.g. Korea, because it was the last in a line of straits that be used to contain China in the Chinese Sea, or Malaysia during the Malay Emergency for the same reason, or Egypt for Suez, or Ethiopia/Eritrea to close the Red Sea etc etc) or resource reasons (Iran, Libya and Iraq for oil, Indonesia and Congo for rubber, Tibet for water etc etc). Essentially, the USA and USSR were trying to put themselves in a position of being unassailably stronger than the other, following the logic of an IR School of thought called Offensive Neorealism.    Then the USSR had an oopsie and left the US unassailable.   The way the Cold War ended effectively discredited the Realist school as the leading theory of international relations. There was a brief time where liberalism managed to take control of Western decision making, this lead to the Liberal Moment where free market capitalism and liberal democracy seemed to have won (referred to as the End of History by Francis Fukuyama as a reference to when Hegel declared the End of History when the Nation State beat the personal state when Napoleon subjugated the Austrian Hapsburg composite realm).   The Liberal Moment resulted in massive interdependence on the global stage with the former Second World mostly being absorbed into the economic system of the First World (IMF, GATT (now the WTO), World Bank and EU in Europe) as they transitioned to market economics. Only really Cuba remained Communist as Deng Xiaoping's market reforms turned China into a manufacturing powerhouse, essentially the modern Workshop of the World. The West heavily encouraged economic integration with the former Second World (especially China) under two assumptions that have turned out to be false. The first is that the improved economic situation of China and other former communist nations would result in a middle class that yearned for democracy under a eurocentric belief that development was linear, with wealth leading to democracy. The second is the Dell Theory, which holds that when a nation is sufficiently integrated into the global economy (e.g. as part of the supply chain of a massive company like Dell) they would not attack their neighbour because the cost of doing so is prohibitively expensive. While the Dell Theory mostly holds, it does not account for an illogical leader or cultural reasons (a common problem with IR theory) as we can see in Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",SnooBooks1701,2023-03-11T09:45:47,2
As you point out there are things that China is doing that could be considered provocative. If the US were not actually avoiding direct confrontation we would be at war.,Decent_Historian6169,2023-03-08T06:04:21,1
"The USA and USSR did NOT have a direct confrontation during the Cold War, so following that playbook could arguably be a path to peace.",BlackandBlue14,2023-03-09T12:43:15,1
"Where does this notion that the US isn't trying to avoid a direct confrontation with China come from? It's no secret that we are codependent, as much as we are at odds with eachother, both have a major role in the other's economy",true_nomad,2023-03-10T20:23:44,1
"This has nothing to do with diplomacy. So everyone knows China's basic positions on such topics as Taiwan plus the fact that they have never been a Western democracy and in fact may to a large extent see that as a foreign concept (the average man on the street anyway). Also the assumption that they are going to try to acquire as much intelligence about us as they can manage. It's been like this for decades, but especially since COVID-19 emerged, it seems we are exposed to anti-Chinese content we weren't seeing before. TBH it may have started under Trump but Biden has done nothing to tone it down. Most propaganda we encounter doesn't appear to come directly from the government. I can remember all the anti-Saddam stuff you saw before the Iraq War, I think it helped get people in the mood for an invasion.  It seems like we are being mentally conditioned to start seeing China as a geopolitical enemy. I can remember when the Navy ASW slogan was ""Sink Soviet Subs"" and wonder how long until it's ""Sink Chinese Subs"". Given that we aren't going to win an all-out war with them and we aren't going to intimidate them into becoming like us, what's the point? Soon TikTok will be banned her. No other country is doing that. Somebody thinks they're going to cash in on all this jingoism. Diplomacy I wish.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2023-03-08T12:00:12,1
"The Liberal Moment ended in the early 2000s, either with 911 or the Iraq Invasion. The legscy of the Liberal Moment lives on, though. China is too deeply ingrained into the global economy to remove it without causing serious damage. That doesn't mean the US isn't confronting China, though.   The main way the US is confronting China is by building a coalition against them, this is easily done because China's history, many territorial disputes and belligerent diplomacy through the ""Wolf Warrior"" ideology of its diplomatic corp means that nearly all of its neighbours hate it. China has very few reliable allies on the global stage, North Korea is more of a liability than an ally, Russia and Myanmar are both pariahs, Pakistan is a complete mess permanently hovering on the edge of bankruptcy, Myanmar is also pariah, Iran is fairweather at best. The BRICS are a joke, India hates China and Brazil is a US ally. China has very few options to build a modern Warsaw Pact with  The US and its allies are engaged in a proxy war with China though, it's just being more subtle about it. China and Russia both backed Assad in the Syrian Civil War while the US backed Rojava and some of the opposition groups, the US backed the rebels in the Darfur War while China backs the Sudanese government, China backs three different rebel campaigns in India (jihadis in Kashmir, Naxalites in East India and Seperatists in the North East and Sikkim) while the US backs India, China has backed Iran in the Saudi-Iran proxy wars while the US backs the Saudis, China backs the Kurdish and Maoist rebels in Turkey while the US backs Turkey, China is alleged to be supporting the insurgent Communists in the Philippines while the US supports the govenrment, China supported the GNA in Libya while the US supported the LNA, China backed the communists in the Nepali Civil War while the US backed the royal family.   There are also several massive differences for the US-China Cold War that's brewing and the US-Soviet one. The biggest one is China's military weakness, China cannot protect power globally, its naval assets are hemmed into the Chinese Sea by a string of US allies who control the straits that it needs to get out into the world (Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, The Philippines, Japan and South Korea). Even if it could get out the Chinese army has basically no prestige, the US has demonstrated its military might multiple times but China hasn't foughts a serious war since its border war in the 70s with Vietnam and hasn't fought a peer since its short war with India in 1962 when it conquered the remote and mostly uninhabited Aksai Chin. While the People's Liberation Army is massive, it's also hilariously corrupt, its equipment is outdated, it lacks combat experience and discipline. The reason China hasn't conquered Taiwan is not just the fact the US has a fleet sitting between the two, it's that China is not logistically capable of sustaining an adequately sized invasion force. This means that China has to rely on its economy to influence other countries, but there's only so far economic power can go, without massive soft power to back it up that countries like the US, UK and France possess it's extremely difficult to leverage economic power.  The other problem China faces is one sentence ""China will grow old before it grows rich"" last year the population of China shrank and it is expected to keep shrinking, decades of badly organised social engineering in the form of the one child policy means that each generation of Chinese youths is smaller than the last and this is extremely dangerous for a number of reasons, most vitally it means that a decreasing number of tax payers have to support a rapidly growing number of dependents. This is made even worse due to China's extreme obsession with having male children, resulting in sex selective abortions, female abandonment and even infanticide resulting in there being tens of millions of men who will not find a wife, across China's entire population there are 34 million excess men, just in the 0-4 year age category there's 6 million more boys than girls,  which accounts for over 1/7th of the population (n.b. at birth naturally, there's about an about 51:49 male:female split). Even if every woman in the 15-29 age category were to marry a man for every 100 couples wedded there would be 12 single men. This has huge impacts on everything from mental health to house prices to public safety. The US doesn't need to engage in a serious cold war with China, they just need to outlast it while China's own demographics cause it to collapse (India has the same crisis and about the same statistics, and didn't even need the government to do anything to make the mess but they have more children so it balances out). The combination of people who can't find a spouse, people continuing to have only one child (even with the end of the one child policy) and natural aging (1/3rd of the population is over 60) means that without the wealth to transition to more automation like Japan has done China's economy will start to stagnate and then contract as the cheap labour model that it has built its economy on dries up and its property bubble bursts as housing demand subsides, the UN's best guess has China dropping below 1 billion people by 2060 and then 767 million by 2100, but that assumes a rising fertility rate, if rates don't rise the population could reach as low as 500 million.   In conclusion to my ramblings, the US is engaging China indirectly and China isn't really a threat if the US can outlast their demographics",SnooBooks1701,2023-03-11T09:45:59,2
"No that didn't happen. I never claimed that the US and USSR had a direct confrontation however the relationship was equivalent to the relationship of two countries involved in an active conflict, they just simply avoided all-out war. If you saw my earlier comment, the ASW branch of the US Navy had the slogan ""Sink Soviet Subs"" as an acknowledgement the the USSR was inarguably the enemy. Since the end of the Cold War, that has never been the relationship between the US and China. Instead, there has been a great deal of engagement at various levels, US citizens have worked in China as academics and vice versa, and many business agreements. Nothing of the sort ever existed between the US and the USSR. So far this engagement has been beneficial. I think the Foreign Policy community in the US and other Western countries quite capable of managing the more recent issues, a lot of which I would blame on the COVID-19 pandemic which as I see it has greatly hurt China and has led the more militant factors in their government to engage in saber-rattling. I personally believe there is a path back up from this nadir, but overtly antagonistic acts such as banning TikTok (which I think will make millions of people angry) even though there's a justification from the point of view of security, won't help. Of course one actually wants confrontation then I suppose one finds such policies gratifying.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2023-03-10T08:16:54,1
"This has always been true but it seems the latest trend is to move towards more open hostility, casting aside our long-term relationships. If this isn't actually happening then I apologize for seeing something that's not there.",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2023-03-11T07:11:18,1
"What you are describing has everything to do with diplomacy. China and the US both are powerful countries with foreign policy goals, and increasingly China's goals have been contradictory to America's goals. What do you expect the US to do? Just back down in every case and let China have its way on every issue we disagree about simply to avoid tensions?  Tensions aren't necessarily bad. You actually *should* have tension when your foreign policy goals aren't in line with another country's. If you don't have tension when your goals aren't in alignment, that means either they are capitulating or you are. And we know China isn't capitulating.  Also, tensions don't necessarily mean war. Look at the Soviets. Did we ever actually sink Soviet subs? Absolutely not. That matters. Simply the existence of rising tension just means both sides are powerful enough to push their conflicting agendas. It's kind of strange that you think banning TikTok is jingoism.  The point is that the US has interests and it shouldn't back down on them just because China gets mad. If China gets mad because we pursue our goals to a reasonable extent...that's their problem. Diplomacy is the vehicle by which these things get resolved and by which tension is addressed and eased--or ramped up when the situation calls for it.",mormagils,2023-03-08T12:09:39,5
"Thank you, your information (I read all of it) was reassuring and relieves some of my anxiety. Just ~~two~~ three observations (not necessarily consistent with your point of view).  1. I can recall from the Cold War that there was a tendency for the media to exaggerate the capabilities of the USSR, making them seem a greater threat than in reality, for example certain types of novel might posit a situation in which the Soviets had developed some sort of super-weapon whereas post Cold War revelations seemed to show that they were much farther beyond the West as regards military technology than generally believed (although the Intelligence Community was probably quite well aware). An example is that the USSR developed a ""version"" of an American radar system that was blatantly imitative however it could only operate in one mode whereas the US version could transition to many different modes. This now seems to be happening with China but wasn't before. I think the magnitude of the threat posed the recent spy balloon incident and TikTok is being blown out of proportion in the same way. 2. Your comment shows that this is a valid topic of discussion but it was brutally downvoted as soon as the mods let it through. That's a shame but I guess that's just me feeling sorry for myself but this topic has really bothered me, I wasn't trying to promote a point of view I just wanted answers for which I thank you. 3. There are a lot of Americans on Reddit so you should be careful using the term ""Liberalism"" as most Americans will misunderstand it.  Cheers!",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2023-03-11T10:10:04,1
"1. Tiktok is actually a security liability, the amount of data it collects and stores on China could put classified documents passing through those phones in the hands of the Chinese state. That's why it is being banned on government devices.  2. America's shitty education system will not stop me from from using the correct name for the Liberal school of International Relations (which is seperate to the ideology of liberalism, although people who follow one tend to also follow the other)",SnooBooks1701,2023-03-11T13:26:13,1
