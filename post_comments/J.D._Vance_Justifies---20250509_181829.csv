"Declaration of Broken ContractWhen in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected themto a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that theyshould declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certainunalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice.That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, todemand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance.The social contract has been broken.The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution.The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protectionunder the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated.When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed,the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority [collapses.In](http://collapses.In) this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation withoutrepresentation.""This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms theright of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution.Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To doso would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties.Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights,the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people.LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL--- GRIEVANCES ---1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments)- U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported indefiance of court order.2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment)- Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance.3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment)- Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legalbasis.4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation""- Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties.5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment)- Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T18:43:33,1

"As per [original article](https://people.com/jd-vance-promises-parents-their-kids-will-have-american-made-weapons-if-they-go-to-war-11732399) üì∞:  - Vice President J.D. Vance is speaking out in defense of President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs ‚Äî including his statements about children needing fewer toys ‚Äî by arguing that Americans could benefit from using American-made weapons if ‚ÄúGod forbid ... your country goes to a war.‚Äù  During an interview with Fox News host Martha MacCallum on Thursday, May 8, Vance, 40, spoke out about Trump‚Äôs comments about his tariffs on goods from China, and said that Americans ‚Äúneed to become more self-reliant.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to happen overnight, and it‚Äôs not always going to be easy,‚Äù Vance told MacCallum. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôd ask people is not whether they want two dolls or five dolls or 20 dolls for their kids. I‚Äôd ask American moms and dads, would you like to be able to go into a pharmacy and know that the drugs your kids need are actually available to you?‚Äù  ‚ÄúAs an American parent, would you like to ‚Äî God forbid, if your country goes to a war and your son or daughter is sent off to fight‚Äîwould you like to know that the weapons that they have are good, American-made stuff, not made by a foreign adversary?‚Äù Vance continued.  Vance‚Äôs interview comes after Trump made comments about his tariffs on foreign goods during a cabinet meeting on April 30.  ‚ÄúSomebody said the shelves will be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30. Maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally,‚Äù Trump said, responding to a question about how the tariffs might continue to affect the U.S. marketplace.  ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre not talking about something where we‚Äôll have to go out of our way,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThey have ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which we don‚Äôt need. And we have to make a fair deal. We‚Äôve been ripped off by every country in the world, but China, I would say, is the leading one.‚Äù  Never miss a story ‚Äî sign up for PEOPLE‚Äôs free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer‚Äã‚Äã, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  In early April, the president upped the tariffs to 145%. Bloomberg reported this week that cargo shipments from China have fallen by an estimated 60%. By the beginning of May, the U.S. Commerce Department released a new report indicating that the American economy shrank by 0.3% during the first quarter of 2025.  Additionally, on Wednesday, after days of insisting he wouldn‚Äôt change course on his sweeping, market-plummeting tariff plan, Trump said he would issue a 90-day pause on the tariffs for nearly all nations ‚Äî excluding China, which had its import tax bumped up to 125%.  Following the announcement, Trump spoke with reporters at the White House, offering his reasoning.  ‚ÄúI thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line... They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a big job to do,‚Äù Trump continued. ‚ÄúNo other president would have done what I did... No others. I know the presidents, they wouldn‚Äôt have done it.‚Äù",T_Shurt,2025-05-09T18:19:05,1
