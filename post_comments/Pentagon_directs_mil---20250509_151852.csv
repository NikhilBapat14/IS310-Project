"I know why Trump wants it, being a Russian plant and all, but I am really hard pressed to understand why a common citizen is okay with kneecapping out own military by expelling a good chunk of it just because of their gender/skin tone.",ERedfieldh,2025-05-09T15:23:24,9
"We must protect our children from any books that might make them uncomfortable, for they are precious little angels that should focus on being kids.   Oh yeah, don't let any of the badass adults in the military read any of those books either.",hey-coffee-eyes,2025-05-09T15:24:57,7

"Going from preferential white male hiring to actually more equitable and fair hiring, will feel unfair for some of those white males. It is not unfair, it is not reverse discrimination, and the ones complaining likely only got hired for being white males.",virrk,2025-05-09T15:34:09,2
"The effort is to purge civility from the U.S. military.    They are the bigot groomers.       Grooming bigotry and prejudices wherever they go: education, libraries, book stores, science, defense, our laws, geopolitics. They're dragging millions of us into their impossible project to purge everyone and everything that's a threat to their perversions.",_Last_Primate,2025-05-09T15:51:25,1
"Why? Killing Afghans, Iraqis, Syrians, Pakistanis, Yemenis, Libyans and Somalis have worked just fine without being racist about it. Even for LGBTQIA+ military personnel. Clearly, books and history doesn’t matter to the US army.  Edit: maybe it’s just the covers",Worksnotenuff,2025-05-09T16:14:52,1
What a waste of taxpayer dollars….. Not to mention how petty…… These buffoons don’t have better things to do like learn how to use something other than ChatGPT for discussing military operations?????,Far-Set-371,2025-05-09T16:41:04,1

"They want the image of masculine dominance rather than actual military strategy. This is why they all loved those Russian military ads a few years ago. It doesn't matter that Russia is destroying their economy and diving deeper into a demographic crisis trying (and failing) to defeat a much smaller enemy, they were real men and not ""woke"".",Citizen_Lunkhead,2025-05-09T16:13:58,2
"Fascists destroy EQUALITY first wherever it flourishes. It's the first pillar to pull down to capture power. But we're not 1930s Germany. We are hyper-priviledged as countries go, and hyper-educated, and the U.S. is much, much larger (land/population) and diverse than hitler's Germany.  Our military is, too, privileged, educated, and diverse.",_Last_Primate,2025-05-09T15:59:01,1
