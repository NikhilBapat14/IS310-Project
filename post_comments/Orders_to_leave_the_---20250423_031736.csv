"From the article, ‚ÄúIt was an apparent glitch in the Trump administration‚Äôs dismantling of another Biden-era policy that allowed people to live and work in the country temporarily. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is quietly revoking two-year permits of people who used an online appointment app at U.S. border crossings with Mexico called CBP One, which brought in more than 900,000 people starting in January 2023.‚Äù  No, I don‚Äôt think it was a glitch. I think the administration really does wanna force out American citizens and immigrants who were told they could come and stay here by the Biden administration. This is not a mistake. This is who Trump is.",animalslover4569,2025-04-23T03:31:07,19
"Jesus could they not come up with a better description than ‚Äúglitch.‚Äù Blaming the Biden administration meanwhile they are detaining US citizens, deporting legal residents, and sending classified information to everyone and their mothers. And then acted like Elon was going to do some fancy tech investigation into how the journalist got added to the group chat on a messaging app. Oops must have been a glitch. God they are so exhaustingüò≠",tsagdiyev,2025-04-23T05:20:16,5
