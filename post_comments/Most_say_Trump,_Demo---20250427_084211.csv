"My fear is Democrats, coming out of the turmoil with Trump and Republicans, will once again be the party of ""let's just get us back to normal."" rather than be a party that commits and delivers on working class priorities and bread and butter issues. They'll coast to an electoral victory on ""normalcy"" but won't be able to sustain their time in office for long.  If Democrats retake office but don't deliver substantial, meaningful policies for many working Americans, and if they just play footsie with Wall Street, make excuses for why the White House can't act (as the Trump admin ignores Congress and courts) they're doomed and we're doomed for more MAGA and maybe a worse executive than Trump in the future.  If we don't get decisive policy on three or four of: maintaining the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, on reining in costs of housing, healthcare, prescription drugs, education, child care, on jobs/wages etc, we're doomed.",jarena009,2025-04-27T08:53:41,118

Unfortunately thats the best case scenario. A Democrat wins the next election simply because of the horrible state of the country after Trump. Then 2032 rolls around and some other bullshit Republican comes around and just says that things were better under Trump blah blah and wins easily again. It’s going to be a rinse and repeat.,taco_studies_major,2025-04-27T14:11:59,6
">""let's just get us back to normal.""     That's who they are.  I've said this in other threads, but it bears repeating because it changes the perspective.  The US sells itself as having a Left and Right Wing party, which is only true in the sense that one party is more to the left of the spectrum than the other.  But both are politically right wing, so Left-Right isn't a useful distinction.    Rather they are Corporatist and Oligarchist (with the Dems being the Corporatists).  Viewed through this lens their behaviours are more predictable and understandable.    The Corporatist values stability.  If they were to run a ranch, they'd want the cows to have long, productive lives.  They would do whatever it took to maximize their yields at a consistent, predictable volume.  If giving the cattle something they'd benefit from or enjoy would increase those yields without costing too much, the Corporatist would implement those things.  But only just those things, under those circumstances.    The Oligarchist values chaos.  They snatch up ranches, offload their debt into one or two of them, then tear up perfectly viable cows for their meat, bones, skin, etc.  Slash and burn, sucking every drop of profit out of the ranch in a flash sale, then shutter it.  There are always other ranches.  This one took their debt away and they made a tidy profit.  On to the next.    Looking at the Dems and Repubs this way makes more sense.  The Dems are always going to vote for Stability, not Progress.  If they swept into power today, they'd have a series of votes that kept things as they are *now*, or slightly better.  But not as good as they were under Biden.  Or Obama.  Or even Bush.  They'd level-set here, and maybe make a few improvements if it ""improved their yields"".    This is why they passed the CR when everyone wanted them to fight back.  They don't fight.  They seek stability, because stable markets are predictable markets, and predictable markets are profitable.    The Progressives like Bernie and AOC?  Well they are that tepid pizza party your Fortune 500 company throws for employees at the end of quarter, after your department made/saved millions of dollars.  And it's cheap gas-station pizza, eaten on your break, surrounded by the other livestock.  Hey, it's something.  The organizer is trying, it's not their fault they only had $50 to spend.    You are right.  They will ""get back to normal"" because that's what they do.  You don't have a Left party.   You don't have a party that is Progressive.  Your hope lies in the Corporatist party.  That's the best you've got.",BadgeOfDishonour,2025-04-27T09:25:48,12
