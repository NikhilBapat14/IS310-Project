"So ignoring Trump's obvious utter stupidity and lies, and the obvious photoshop, Abrego most certainly has MS-13  tattoos on his knuckles. On his knuckles are a marijuana leaf (M), a smile (S), a cross (represents 1 god), and a skull (3 holes). A couple tattoo artists pointed that out. It's fairly common for people to get dogwhistle representations rather than the outright words or symbol (think 88, 14, 109, and a whole host of other numbers than are are Nazi/Aryan Brotherhood/white supremacist representations for those who know). For this to just be a coincidence is pretty unlilely.  That said, it's pretty likely Abrego is not actually an MS-13 member since they don't go for obscure references. The whole point is to instill fear when seeing their tattoos. They're billboards, no ambiguity. My guess is Abrego is an MS-13 wannabe.  But to your post, that's what true Trump Derangement Syndrome is. They're a fucking cult.  Edit: would love to hear an actual reason for downvoting this. Those are his tattoos.

"I know. Because we know that is the word or name on the head ( as  we have been in stress from this person for 10 years already ).

Or, calculate the amount of money you have paid into Social Security since your first paycheck. Add interest. This is the amount the government has been holding in a special account- of your $. That you will get when you get to retire, or age 62. Of course the longer you wait to take it, the more $ you will get each month. Each month until you take last breath. Even if you are 102. Trump has his slippery fingers on your money. And your parents, and grandparents. If the elders in our families do not get their money, they must come live with us= family members, who must pay for their every need- even medical. And you and the rest of us must stay healthy, because we will never be able to retire ourselves. And knowing this makes me angry.
