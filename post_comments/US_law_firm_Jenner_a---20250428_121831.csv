Lead Lines:  April 28 (Reuters) - U.S. law firm Jenner & Block asked a judge on Monday to permanently bar Republican U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order punishing the firm for its affiliation with a prosecutor who investigated ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia.  A lawyer for the firm told Republican-appointed U.S. District Judge John Bates at a hearing in Washington that the danger of Trump's pressure campaign against law firms had only grown since Jenner was targeted in the March order.  ![gif](giphy|l3V0wkQ2KKcAeW8Cs),D-R-AZ,2025-04-28T12:19:49,21
