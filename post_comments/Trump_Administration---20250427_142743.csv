> They’re deranged. I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law  Well ain't that the pot calling the kettle black,anndrago,2025-04-27T15:00:28,28
"Yes, well it seems the judges are awake and finding you breaking the law.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T14:39:50,18

so trumps doubling down on going after judges that go against his wishes and wants,saiyanscaris,2025-04-27T14:36:51,26
  Isn't this state where Musk tried to influence an election? The fallout from all this is going to be immensely interesting.,Wide-Secretary7493,2025-04-27T15:46:16,5

"They're just going down the list, and checking it twice. They really don't care if you were naughty or nice. First they came for the illegal immigrants, last they will come for old Bob with his beer can because he didn't salute hard enough when the Trump Drone went by... Wake up.",SolarDynasty,2025-04-28T05:26:38,2

Judge s all  Judges take an oath to uphold  constitutional law from the Supreme Court to the traffic court they do not take an oath to support the president because the are in office for a life time,Legal-Maintenance282,2025-04-28T12:15:40,1
Yes they will come for old Bob he will be fined get a court date Judge will  see he has not broken any laws and warn him not to get excited when police around,Legal-Maintenance282,2025-04-28T12:19:35,1
"This is just begging for a meme or a parody or something. Put on Lauryn Hill's ""Ready Or Not"" and tweak the lyrics and bit and show images of Homan, Bondi and Trump looking psychotic since that's what they are. It'll have Trump sitting in his office looking like he did that day Eloser took over everything with his booger-eating son.",usernames_suck_ok,2025-04-27T15:28:56,0

Judges are slave to presidency normally if they are they can not be judges,Legal-Maintenance282,2025-04-27T14:33:59,-30
Judges above the law? Excuse me but they are the law. They interpret and enforce the law. The only ones making up the law are the Supreme Court justices bought by this administration,graesen,2025-04-27T17:29:00,8
"Yes, also, courtrooms are those places you keep losing in, because the shit you’re doing is unconstitutional and illegal.",JahoclaveS,2025-04-27T14:59:13,18
Good luck with that.  Congress (Republican especially) will start to realize that the heat will extend to their feet if the Judicial Branch doesn’t uphold the rule of law.  It eventually will not be in their best interest.  But they are oh so good at letting other people shield them from the terrible effects of their complicity.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T14:42:10,4
Nah. Lauryn Hill's - Mystery of Iniquity - is probably a better track. The lyrics are more specific about judicial corruption.,Vapur9,2025-04-27T20:31:13,-1
What are you talking about.  Judges are a member of the *judicial* branch. They are completely and totally independent of the *executive* branch.,HerbaciousTea,2025-04-27T14:38:14,22
wtf are you talking about the judicial branch is a separate branch,redditlvlanalysis,2025-04-27T14:56:00,9
