"It's honestly sickening that over 1,500 student visas have been revoked, particularly since Inside Higher Ed noted this, and to be honest, it's disturbing that ICE is unlawfully terminating SEVIS records to coerce students, what can we possibly do to stop this obvious abuse of power, especially when these students just want to continue their studies and contribute to our country?",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-22T10:51:14,139

"    They won’t they’ve already broken idk lost count somewhere in the hundreds of labor rights, privacy, security and human rights laws. You think a simple order will make them simply listen. Good luck you either have to arrest them or shut up and be complicit.       It’s hard to believe we passed the crossroads, but The train has left the station buckle in cause it’s the ride down to the depths of human degeneracy.        Good words from teddy roosevelt I might be misquoting anyone who blindly follows a president is  anti - American. In other words using force and fighting for democracy isnt anti-American it’s actually strongly American. But those times definitely were horrible for anyone but the white man but still teddy I believe he was a true American and represented critical thinking and intelligence despite his ignorant belief in America #1.",BathroomOpposite8799,2025-04-22T10:34:54,18

"My SO has been in here since 2019 doing her Masters and is one year from finishing her PhD. She and her F1 visa friends are terrified. One was forced to give up her passcode and had her phone scanned when traveling to Miami for an academic conference...on a domestic flight. We could go get married but even that will just put a bigger target on her back. These students all came here to get the best education and contribute to their academic communities and hopefully stay in the US long term. Many of them are starting to question what is even the point, and some of them are applying for PR in Canada. The Trump admin is only making our country dumber and weaker.",toby-sux,2025-04-22T11:19:30,70
"> what can we possibly do to stop this obvious abuse of power,  At the individual level?  * Contact your Rep and Senators, daily if need be, until they give you an appropriate answer for what they're doing. * Contact the Rep and Senators and Governor in the state you go to school in (if you do). * Donate to the ACLU and other organizations that are putting up legal battles on behalf of Democrats, immigrants, LGBTQ+, students, etc.. * Protest, go to town halls, and make your voice heard (e.g. op-eds) * And most importantly, talk to literally every one you know and make sure they're doing all of the above too and are actively organizing to vote out Republicans in 2026.  Some of this will have an immediate impact (e.g. legal battles), some may slow the damage, and some may take a long time to have an impact, but it all helps, no matter how far it moves the needle.  Unfortunately the time to stop Trump was last November, now all we can do is slow the damage until the 2026 elections or until there appears to be enough moment that the GOP will impeach Trump, which requires 13+ GOP Senators to flip on him, a tall if not impossible task.",atreeismissing,2025-04-22T20:37:26,6
