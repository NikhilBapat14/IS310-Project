"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJllQ9d3pYM)  2010 speech at Google. The question asked by the interviewer starts at 31:30 and that clip takes place at 33:47.   She was being asked about her concerns over online privacy and how she (as DA) addresses that vs. another candidate.  I don't see how this is being taken out of context, as I don't think her explanation is incorrect? The only part I could really see is where she says the cloud is ""above us"" while pointing up, even though she immediately follows up by saying it's not in a physical location. If the confusion is ""well the cloud is physical because it's made up of servers which are physical,"" well I believe they are confusing ""cloud servers"" with  ""*the* cloud,"" the latter of which she was referring to",Difficult_Network745,2024-08-04T15:20:35,10
"I too would like to see the full quote - the only thing I can offer is that she looks quite a bit younger, so it would presumably be from a number of years ago.",Cornwallis,2024-08-04T14:19:55,1

Thank you! And I actually do think her quote was right. I was just more curious about the context in which it was said in.,LilyMilovnik,2024-08-04T18:28:49,4

"That is true, but ""the cloud"" specifically references the information that is accessible without needing to be there physically. The physical server (located in a data center usually) that runs the cloud is called a ""cloud server""",Difficult_Network745,2024-08-04T18:01:29,4
"You're doing politician speak. She said it's not physical, but that's mistaken. Understandable mistake for a layman but probably a public official shouldn't speak authoratively on a subject they know little of.",PrimalForceMeddler,2024-08-04T18:02:47,-5
"""The cloud"" = stuff accessible via the internet. YouTube is part of the cloud (not a physical place)  ""Cloud server(s)"" = the computer(s) that has the stuff downloaded so you can access it via the internet (physical place)",Difficult_Network745,2024-08-04T18:12:24,5
She’s correct though. “The cloud” refers to the networked communications between servers.   https://www.britannica.com/technology/cloud-computing  No offense but it’s really silly to get upset at her about this. Feels weird and nitpicky for no important reason,[deleted],2024-08-04T18:58:26,4
