All hail the honorable Senator Booker. Let his courage serve as an inspiration to all of us to stand up and fight for the America that we believe in.,Belledujour2022,2025-04-01T22:09:56,11
"I think the Democrats can make this a,thing and highlight how having a minority party in this day and age stops you from accomplishing nearly anything if they *almost* follow in Bookers footsteps.  What if as many Dems as they could manage continue to do their own filibuster.  They need to aim for 24 hours 18 minutes and stop (one minute more than Thurman).  They would be showcasing hard work and a broken system, while pushing an old school racist Republican out of the record books (while leaving Booker's in place as it should).  Thoughts other than it's be difficult to find many (I'd say any would help, and hope a few are inspired)?",JamarcusFarcus,2025-04-01T21:59:47,12
"Booker should spend the next couple weeks going on the Bulwark, Raging Moderates, Pod Save America, Kara Swisher, Ezra Klein, Gavin Newsom, Club Shay Shay, etc.   In this media environment a headline online lasts an afternoon. Later today Trump will threaten to send journalists to El Salvador and everyone will forget about Cory Booker.   Hopefully Booker keeps his foot on the gas pedal.",8to24,2025-04-02T06:58:06,6

Some democrats like Biden are making the same mistake they must step aside to let the party progress.

It’s hard to do what Booker did. That’s like a once in a lifetime type thing.   What’s more feasible is probably 5-6 hour floor speeches and things of that nature.,milin85,2025-04-02T12:13:32,2
"I think the important thing is the writing on the wall is getting bolder and clearer for the old guard.  None of them have seen the levels of push back and vitriol from their left leaning constituents like they have recently.  Moreover, unlike the Republicans, there is not as much forgiving and forgetting here.  The message of we don't want you is getting a bit louder everyday we just need more viable younger candidates to step up and take their place.",JamarcusFarcus,2025-04-02T10:05:32,0
