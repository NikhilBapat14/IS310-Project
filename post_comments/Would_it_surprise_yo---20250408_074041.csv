"69M married women could lose their voting rights if the SAVE Act is passed. Why?  Absent a valid passport, you must present a birth certificate *with the same name as your registration* to be registered.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-08T07:42:34,32

"When we see the outcomes of Republican legislation then we know the real intent.   All this Real ID and passport nonsense for proving you're an American citizen and *not committing a crime* is absolutely voter suppression targeted at all the citizens who don't have extra money and time. Since we have statistically negligible voter fraud this is a solution seeking a nonexistent problem.  For Republicans, having to count our votes is the problem.",YallerDawg,2025-04-08T08:14:35,19

We'll see women going to court to change their names back to their maiden names and lot of men pissed that their wives no longer have their names. Which will lead to us losing our right to change our name once we're we'd and laws requiring us to change our names to our spouses.,BustAMove_13,2025-04-08T08:43:23,15

"First of all, thank you for posting this-I don't think this is getting enough exposure.  I have wondered though, if this will suppress more Republican/Conservative votes that Democrat.  Perhaps this is about suppressing all women, and regardless of the fallout for either party.",Broad-Key7342,2025-04-08T09:37:13,7
They always give these heroic names. More like “screw these people” than save.,Icy-Profession-1979,2025-04-08T11:51:47,3
I wonder how much this would backfire since single women are more liberal lol,mbstout1,2025-04-08T19:14:16,3
I honestly do not understand why people go out of their way to try to make shit like this happen. Can’t they just live their life and mind their own business!? I’m genuinely so uninteresting why do they care about what I do so much!?,tsagdiyev,2025-04-08T21:45:31,2
"My husband and I were trying to read through the act from the house last night. I get the part about needing real ID or a passport, but don't understand the talk about names changed when married.  Would someone explain like I'm 5 why this is a worry please?   We definitely didn't like that those who are registering people to vote may be sued or held criminally responsible.  What if you make a mistake? Then you go to jail?  What if you do it perfectly, but you have someone being a jerk about it and now you have to get a lawyer to defend yourself?",PattyRain,2025-04-08T10:43:27,1
My new social security card has my married name. Didn’t we have to prove all this to get that star on our drivers licenses?,SaveBandit91,2025-04-08T21:10:15,1
Joke’s on them with how married women vote (and I’d guess married women who changed their name are even more Republican.),tc100292,2025-04-08T22:37:17,1
"Not trying to make light of this, but the truth is that married liberal, progressive, Dem. etc. women, hetero or not, are more likely to retain their own name instead of taking on their partners'.    So, this would effectively block a larger chunk of Conservative women from voting than it would lefty women.   Also, would this be for new voter registrations?",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:19:34,1
"I don't want this to pass either, but it has been overblown in the fear-mongering.  The Real ID that the fed has been pushing for years upon years is the same requirements.  (Deadline is currently 5/7/25, they've been pushing that date back for like 4 or 5 years) So if you've already gotten a Real ID, or have the documents to get one, you already have what you need to *register* to vote.  *Register*, not to vote each time.   So yeah, it's bad, but it isn't a doomsday situation. There is no need to run to court to change your name back to your birth name, like I've seen suggested.",TableAvailable,2025-04-08T08:01:49,-4

"It is voter suppression for sure but the funny part is that overall a liberal, Dem., Progressive, etc. is more likely to have a passport and/or a real ID than a conservative is. When you look at something like Florida District 1,  the 'law' itself could be what shifts it from deep red to blue or at least purple.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:23:48,2
There are already women changing their names back to their birth names just in case.,PattyRain,2025-04-08T10:21:57,11
"Oh jeebus.  Conservative and / or highly religious men, sure.  Liberal men are likely going to be cool with it.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:25:50,2
"This is definitely meant to suppress all women, but there is a very real threat of backfire here given that Trump needs Republican women to vote for him. The people primarily affected by this will be Republican women.",Rosebunse,2025-04-08T11:07:23,6
"My take is that it is meant to primarily suppress liberal women but the way it is being done is to appear as if it is going to suppress all women.   But, the reality is that unless it blatantly states that no woman can vote, period, the net result will be less conservative women getting to vote than less liberal women.",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:29:07,3
"In order to register to vote, you need to prove you are a citizen, and they want to see your birth certificate. If you are registering under your married name, your last name does not match the birth last name and they would deny registration to you.",ladymorgahnna,2025-04-08T20:54:34,1
"""Fear mongering"". Every time anyone objects to anything harmful Republicans are doing, some Republican comes along and accuses them of fear mongering, to shut down any opposition or discourse.   Its disingenuous gaslighting.",Blossom73,2025-04-08T09:56:25,5
"Real ID is still limiting.   The residency requirements are significantly stricter than getting a normal driver's license. You must be able to prove you live where you live based on a bank statement, a credit card bill, utilities in your name, a tax return at that address, or your property tax statement.   When we move to our new house, even though I have a joint bank account with my husband that I opened, the bank was unable to print my name on the statement.  I had all the utilities in my name, but the first utility bills were not going to arrive for 60 days.   In Minnesota, you are supposed to get your ID updated within 30 days of moving.  So, no tax return had been filed yet at the new house. I had a bank account, but they couldn't print my name on the front page to prove I was a joint holder. I'm on the title with him, but no property tax statement so that didn't count. I could have used the mortgage, but because of our personal finances he was the only one on the mortgage. And I am in a very egalitarian, progressive marriage.   What are women to do who don't have the blessing of their husband to put utilities in their name, or who don't earn any income and therefore are kept off tax returns? And you really think they'd be allowed to have their own bank account or open their own credit card?   That was 7 years ago that I was unable to get the Real ID. Because I needed my updated driver's license for another reason, I fell back to a standard ID and only got it replaced with Real ID a few weeks ago.",tddawg,2025-04-08T08:15:14,10
"Thank you!    I get the problem with having paperwork, but if you had your marriage certificate too would that be enough with your birth certificate? ",PattyRain,2025-04-09T00:12:21,1
"I'm not a republican, and I generally call republican tactics ""fearmongering"".  I just think this has been presented in such an overblown way.    No, it shouldn't pass.   But it won't prevent married women from ever voting.  No,  you don't have to change your name.   Most of us don't have to do anything at all.   It isn't requiring us to provide proof of citizenship at the polling place.  It's requiring proof to register,  instead of attesting that we are citizens and letting the state find the proof.   *If it even passes""   We have far bigger problems than Real ID.",TableAvailable,2025-04-08T11:42:54,-3

"I still have nothing in my name. It’s been 9 years, and my husband is the sole income earner. We see no reason to change.  I have a passport card instead of a Real ID.",Author_Noelle_A,2025-04-08T10:26:40,3
"I got my Real ID back when they were first introduced.  I no longer remember what I had to do to get it, but from my memory all I did was renew my license and what showed up in the mail was the Real ID version.    Maybe I just got lucky for being an early adopter?",crucial_geek,2025-04-08T12:35:52,2
Consider the requirements for a passport card.,Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-08T12:58:47,1
"This is a solution in search of a near non existent problem. There aren't masses of noncitizens registering to vote, so why the need for this at all?  The rest of your claims are wrong as well.   https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5301676/save-act-explainer-voter-registration",Blossom73,2025-04-08T11:44:35,3
"I agree. I brought a mountain of paperwork to the BMV a few years ago to try to get a Real ID, and it still wasn't sufficient.   I had a stamped certified printout from the SSA, with my name and Social Security number, and the clerk refused to accept it, saying I needed the actual card. At the time my state didn't allow residents to order replacement Social Security cards online, and the local Social Security office would only give me that printout.   I ended up just getting a passport card. It was much easier. But I also understand that not everyone has the ability to obtain a passport either, for various reasons.",Blossom73,2025-04-08T10:01:16,3
