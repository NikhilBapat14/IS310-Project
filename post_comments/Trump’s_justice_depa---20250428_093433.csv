"> “It is extremely clear that the intent is to get absolutely nothing done. And the effect will be that absolutely nothing gets done.”  ... It's just awful. I mean, this whole thing is such an obvious attack on our democracy... and while the news is terrible, really, it is, at least it's reassuring to hear that even within the DOJ, there were folks who maintained a degree of professionalism and respect for one another. A small thing, I guess, but it shows that not everyone has completely abandoned all sense of decency. It's just... depressing, to see our government behaving like this.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-28T09:42:48,14
