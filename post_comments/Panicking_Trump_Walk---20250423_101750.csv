"It’s market manipulation.  Edit: To everyone who says Trump is just stupid, how does that help? How many times are we going to let him play dumb and get away with it?

I assume with further automation in the future more stuff will be made in the US because it'll be cheaper to have a robot make it here vs having a robot make it in China and then ship it 10,000 miles.
