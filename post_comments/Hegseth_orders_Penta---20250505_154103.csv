"> Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered senior Pentagon leadership to cut the number of four-star generals and admirals by at least 20% across the military, according to a memo signed by Hegseth dated Monday and obtained by CNN.  > As of 2023, there were 37 four-star generals and admirals across the entire military.    37 is too many?      And 8 of those career servants of the United States have to go because 20% is the number he pulled out of his ass?",Searchlights,2025-05-05T15:43:43,32
They're purging the military of anyone who might not comply with executive orders. I hope everyone understands what this means.,JFJinCO,2025-05-05T16:14:21,20

"He's going to purge the 7 generals appointed by Biden, as expected.  just openly setting up for their end game, aren't they?",Actual_Intercourse,2025-05-05T17:12:12,4
This is reminding me of the decimation in the book _World War Z_ except than in this case they are cutting twice as many.  ,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-05-05T17:27:37,3
This should ring alarm bells tbh,Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-05-06T05:52:21,3
Seems like he wants to end and semblance of sober second thought. ,CitySeekerTron,2025-05-05T16:02:32,2

"There is such a thing as general bloat as people earn promotions faster than others retire, and it should be addressed, but I have no confidence this drunk will do anything in an organized well thought out way.",hopesolosass,2025-05-05T20:13:11,0
This is probably smoke and mirrors to hide the fact they will cut those that aren't all on board the Trump train. He needs generals that will support martial law whenever Trump wants.,Dewgong_crying,2025-05-05T15:45:47,46
I wonder if there are 7 generals in particular that he wants cut,HibbletonFan,2025-05-05T15:45:25,9
"You can tell which ones will get the boot because they're not white men. Thus perceived to not be ""on board"".  I just reviewed photos, and by a quick estimate... that's about the right percentage.",CockBrother,2025-05-05T15:53:09,15
Oh cut him some slack.   He was probably drunk at the time.   We all do dumb things when we're drunk. /s,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-05T16:03:53,2
"There has been rank creep over the decades; I think we could probably stand to remove a few general officer billets. But like someone below said, this is really a loyalty purge more than an actual attempt at streamlining.",Cdub7791,2025-05-05T16:19:17,2

This is the only reason. American generals are being fired so maga generals will do illegal things to citizens.,ajtreee,2025-05-05T18:35:45,11
