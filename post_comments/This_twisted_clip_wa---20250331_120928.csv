Also for clarity, there doesn't seem to be an official account for the committee as a whole. There's the one for the Democrats on the committee \@HouseForeign, and the Repubicans @HouseForeignGOP.

The reason they did this is because USAID is the lead agency is tracking and advising countries in combating Russian oligarch money laundering.  I personally saw documents regarding Trump org laundering wealth extracted from former Soviet republics by Russian oligarchs.   It was USAID that had acquired those documents and tracked the laundering.  Dismantling USAID was an act of corruption.,Perfecshionism,2025-03-31T12:55:31,54
