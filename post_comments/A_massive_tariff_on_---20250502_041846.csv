"Goods under $800 are no longer tariff-exempt as of today.  Say goodbye to cheap and easy ways to buy things from China. Hope you enjoy less choice and grotesque markup.  Not only that, but without foreign competition that can't be driven out of business, American big business will aggressively move to quash small business competition (who will enforce anti-monopolistic laws? Trump? Ha ha, yeah right.)  This isn't just about higher prices, this is another driver towards the merger of state and corporation, and a reality when the success of a business first and foremost is tied not to its competitiveness, prices, or quality, but to its loyalty and usefulness to the regime.  And this is coming from the party which blamed ESG for ""making businesses beholden to a political agenda rather than consumers and shareholders.""   Every accusation is a confession. Every damn one.",GeneReddit123,2025-05-02T04:20:20,49
"Dear people who think we should just have faith that Trump knows what he's doing and just ""trust the process"":  Ask yourself this.  Trump just said that Biden is responsible for the downturn of the economy.  Does it make sense to respond to a downturn in the economy by raising prices on consumer goods?   Isn't that like starting a fight with someone (let's say a big shredded guy named China) when you've got a broken leg and a sprained wrist?  Wouldn't it be better to start the fight after you've had a chance to heal?  If I lose my job because no one is buying 30 dolls anymore, then I'm not going to have any money to buy whatever products those supposed Make America Great Again^TM factories are going to be making.  I am going to be directing every penny (including the pennies I'd normally have in the stock market) towards paying for food and shelter.  Now multiply my behavior by 300,000,000.  Do you see why every respectable economist is shaking their head over these tariffs?",autotelica,2025-05-02T06:48:37,10

"Uh oh, the cheap Amazon & Temu knick knacks that have kept the populace anesthetized is about to go away.    I don’t think that the Republicans realize that the cheap flow of goods from China was a big factor in keeping people passive. Americans are conditioned to view their citizenship through the lens of being a consumer. Like it or not, access to inexpensive goods from around the world is part of the American identity and has been for decades. Now that it’s being stripped away, things will slowly get even more interesting. It’s going to directly mess with Americans’ self perception.",alien88,2025-05-02T06:34:58,10

"Trump has invoked the single largest tax increase, ever, on America.  And because its ephemeral in nature.  No company is going to spend millions building production to capture the value in domestic production.  Because its only value is that the competition is aggressively taxed domestically.  They won't be able to compete globally. So the market is limited to the US.  No one will take that risk.",Save_The_Wicked,2025-05-02T09:07:16,2

"Franklin Roosevelt sent this message to Congress in 1938 on the verge of World War II. His words precisely analyze the situation we are in, and prophesy a fascist future we must, at all costs, avoid. He wrote:  “Unhappy events abroad have retaught us two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people.  The first truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is fascism — ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.  The second truth is that the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.”",FrederickClover,2025-05-02T05:40:08,29

">The prevalence of the corporation in America has led men of this generation to act, at times, as if the privilege of doing business in corporate form were inherent in the citizen, and has led them to accept the evils attendant upon the free and unrestricted use of the corporate mechanism as if these evils were the inescapable price of civilized life, and, hence to be borne with resignation.  >Throughout the greater part of our history, a different view prevailed.  >Although the value of this instrumentality in commerce and industry was fully recognized, incorporation for business was commonly denied long after it had been freely granted for religious, educational, and charitable purposes.  >It was denied because of fear. Fear of encroachment upon the liberties and opportunities of the individual. Fear of the subjection of labor to capital. Fear of monopoly. Fear that the absorption of capital by corporations, and their perpetual life, might bring evils similar to those which attended mortmain [immortality]. There was a sense of some insidious menace inherent in large aggregations of capital, particularly when held by corporations.  >Blast from the past, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, 1933 dissent in Liggett v.
