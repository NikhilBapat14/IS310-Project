Alabama is one Senate vote away this week from making it an official state holiday. If it fades away at the last minute you can bet something is coming down.,YallerDawg,2025-05-04T13:28:16,53

He hasn’t cancelled it because he can’t figure out what or when it is. /S,MuthaPlucka,2025-05-04T13:53:20,25
"The Juneteenth parade here in Indianapolis, IN has already been canceled. It’s coming for sure.",Bceverly,2025-05-04T14:04:09,44
He will probably rename it “Patriot’s Day”,ParfaitAdditional469,2025-05-04T13:54:45,13

"Any day now. How does this sort of nonsense help anyone? We’ve gone from the dog-whistles of the “southern strategy” to boot-licking capitalism, institutionalized White Supremacy, Christian Identity, and misogyny in 60 years.   I cannot understand how women, POC, non-Christians, and working class people could vote for these evil grifters. And yet they unapologetically did, and most still worship them.",joesperrazza,2025-05-04T14:11:26,17
Honestly I’m surprised it’s still around,slobs_burgers,2025-05-04T13:24:18,9

I'm sure there is an EO coming.,EbbtidesRevenge,2025-05-04T14:00:07,7
Juneteenth was declared a federal holiday in a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president. So Trump can't revoke it by executive order. What he can do is order the military and all executive branch agencies not to celebrate it. The Defense Intelligence Agency already canceled Juneteenth observances pursuant to Trump's anti-DEI policy.,Leopold_Darkworth,2025-05-04T17:16:49,6
I’m wondering about MLK day. But yah. This too,IdahoDuncan,2025-05-04T14:50:27,4

I'd say about six weeks.,Autodidact2,2025-05-04T16:13:01,2
Once his weekly coloring book/dictator-themed planner placemat includes the holiday for that week he will start throwing ketchup and mewling like a fat baby.,Mr-Hoek,2025-05-04T16:28:24,2
He can cancel whatever he wants but there’s no law yet that prohibits celebrating a landmark occasion. Mark it on your calendar and break out the grill!,Current_Analysis_104,2025-05-04T17:03:54,2

It will obviously be canceled. Plan for how to react not asking if it’ll happen because it’s a guarantee,alexjf56,2025-05-04T19:02:49,1

"All 50 States and DC recognize Juneteenth in some form.  But only 28 States and DC recognize it as an official public holiday.  Alabama is one of the States where it is recognized, but not an official holiday.   So, if the recognition fails, I doubt it has anything to do with 'something coming down the pipe' and would have more to do with it simply being Alabama.",crucial_geek,2025-05-05T16:28:01,2
