"From the article:  Challengers might still be able to obtain broader relief at an early stage of litigation by having their case certified as a class-action lawsuit with a national scope or by other measures. But those types of procedures are a more burdensome and time-consuming path to combat Trump’s fast-moving clip.  “Without nationwide injunctions, Trump will win by losing, because he can lose cases again and again and still implement his policies for most people, most of the time,” said University of Virginia law professor Amanda Frost, whose work on nationwide injunctions has been cited by the liberal justices. “If he could deport anyone he wants to for the next year, and says he can’t get them back, then he’s accomplished most of his goal even if the Supreme Court eventually says he can’t legally do it.”  Where the justices stand  Three members of the high court’s right flank have already made clear that they would all but eliminate lower courts’ power to issue nationwide injunctions.  Last year, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito joined an opinion written by Justice Neil Gorsuch saying that “lower courts would be wise to take heed” of the “rule that any equitable remedy they issue must not be ‘more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to [redress]’ the plaintiff ’s injuries.”  A warning, in other words, that injunctions and other relief should be limited to the named plaintiffs in a case, rather than applying across the country.  ***  “There are about 3.5 million births in the U.S. every year,” Frost explained. If the current nationwide injunctions are ruled unlawful, “every single one of those families will now have to prove their status or child’s status to get federal benefits, or passports for their kids.”  “Many other families would be denied citizenship, and each and everyone does not have the capacity to sue,” she added.  And abolishing nationwide injunctions would mean a tougher fight for the many groups suing the administration, if only because it will add to the constant legal uncertainty and chaos that sometimes enables Trump’s policies. During the time it takes for cases to percolate up to the Supreme Court, the administration would have authority to continue policies and practices that some courts have already temporarily put on hold.",LurkerFromTheVoid,2025-04-22T16:37:59,9

"Trump lives in the appellate pause, his specialty for defrauding contractors who couldn't wait out the time lag between work done and payment delivered when he reneged on bids after work was completed.  The courts should recognize and impose a faster time sequence when dire times are recognized.  If the administration weren't so busy violating established law in so many places their argument could stand. But this is an assault on all fronts.  If the Supreme court were to rule in favor of this they should also realize the need to expedite appeals.",Senior_Ganache_6298,2025-04-22T18:19:35,1
"Nationwide injunctions are a double edged sword. Yes, they can be used to protect rights, but far right judges have also used them to take down civil rights protections and access to abortion drugs.   Limiting them to the circuits might be a better option, maybe even with some sort of fast track to the circuit court to litigate the issue so onerous injunctions are dealt with quicker.  Of course, the right has captured far too much of the judiciary and there are circuits that would likely back these bad injunctions, so people in those states would have to live with it while better represented circuits would remove the injunction.",travio,2025-04-22T16:51:01,-1
