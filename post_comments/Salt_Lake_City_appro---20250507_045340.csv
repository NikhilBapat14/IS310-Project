"   Opinion: Utah’s Flag Ban Isn’t About Unity — It’s About Erasure  Utah’s new law restricting which flags can be flown on state property isn’t about neutrality. It’s about silencing the LGBTQ+ community — plain and simple. The pride flag is the clear target, even if lawmakers won’t say it outright.  Supporters claim the law avoids “political statements.” But if religious symbols or military emblems are still allowed, it’s not about avoiding politics — it’s about picking winners and losers. And right now, queer Utahns are the ones being told they don’t belong.  Let’s stop pretending this is harmless. When the state bans a symbol of inclusion and identity, it’s making a statement: you are not welcome here. That’s not order — that’s soft authoritarianism.  This isn’t just a flag. It’s a line in the sand. And if we stay silent, we’re complicit ...",suth108,2025-05-10T08:18:00,1

When her husband died, she had a mental breakdown and went to a mental health facility. While there, she met a few trans people and was shocked that ""they were just people."" She found them smart, and funny, and totally relatable. She felt ""lied to"" by conservative media about the dangers of trans people. She has since taken back all of her transphobic opinions, but she hasn't connected the dots and decided that if they were fearmongering about trans people, they were probably fearmongering about other demographics, too.
