And right now, queer Utahns are the ones being told they don‚Äôt belong.  Let‚Äôs stop pretending this is harmless.

When her husband died, she had a mental breakdown and went to a mental health facility. While there, she met a few trans people and was shocked that ""they were just people."" She found them smart, and funny, and totally relatable. She felt ""lied to"" by conservative media about the dangers of trans people. She has since taken back all of her transphobic opinions, but she hasn't connected the dots and decided that if they were fearmongering about trans people, they were probably fearmongering about other demographics, too.
