"I’ve haven’t been this proud of my mom in a long time.   When you think about giving up, remember there are people like this that know that they only have a finite time left that are fighting for us. You are on the right side of history. Don’t forget.",They_Beat_Me,2025-05-10T16:35:39,32

I love the play on words but this is bordering on Piggy slander and I won’t stand for it.,DinkandDrunk,2025-05-10T16:55:15,3
Any such signs t-shirts or mugs ought to have an upside-down confederate flag on them with a note saying TRAITOR FLAG according to Robert E. Lee that was in the last general order Lee issued to his troops and he told those troops to store those confederate flags in their attics since they were traitor flags. The order if memory serves can be looked up in library of congress so has survived in written form.,jdash54,2025-05-10T17:13:07,3
