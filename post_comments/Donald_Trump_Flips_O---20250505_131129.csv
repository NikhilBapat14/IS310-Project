When the Wall Street Journal isn't right wing enough for you. you know you've got problems.,biscuitarse,2025-05-05T13:16:01,6531
"**From reporter Lee Moran:**  Donald Trump flipped out at a journalist for The Wall Street Journal on board Air Force One on Sunday.  The journalist drew Trump’s ire after asking about talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the U.S. president’s effort to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine over the former’s invasion of the latter.  Trump asked which outlet the reporter worked for, a tactic he’s resorted to frequently during his second term.  When told the Journal, he then railed: “That’s what I thought. Boy, you people treat us so badly. Wall Street Journal has truly gone to hell. Go ahead, yeah. Rotten newspaper. You hear me? What I said? It’s a rotten newspaper.”  Trump then told the journalist to “go ahead” with the question, but refused to answer. “I wouldn’t tell The Wall Street Journal because it’d be wasting my time. There are talks, but I don’t want to talk to The Wall Street Journal. Look, Wall Street Journal is China-oriented, and they’re really bad for this country.”  Here's a link to the full article: [https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wall-street-journal-reporter-question\_n\_681857cee4b08041c58c79f1?utm\_medium=Social&utm\_source=reddit&utm\_campaign=us\_main](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-wall-street-journal-reporter-question_n_681857cee4b08041c58c79f1?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main)",huffpost,2025-05-05T13:13:08,2641

It is evident by Trumps behavior that perhaps he is suffering from mental decline. When someone’s prior behavior becomes more angry and unable to answer questions it shows his decline.  He has always double talked and evaded answering but now he gets exasperated easily. His attention span is very limited. This is very concerning since this is the individual who is representing the citizens of the US.,Sea-Bandicoot-5329,2025-05-05T18:14:52,11

WSJ is the closest to centrist of any right leaning media in the country despite being Murdoch owned.  Probably because it is more focused on fiscal news than anything else and numbers are much harder to bullshit in a publication aimed toward the people most qualified to interpret and assess those numbers.

"It's a common tactic. Acting hostile and aggressive reduces the likelihood that someone will feel comfortable questioning you. Most normal people avoid confrontation so telegraphing to everyone that you're going to escalate any minor critique makes people less likely to voice that critique.   At this point, we are all going to have to start fighting our own instincts in a lot of this stuff. The more abrasive people like Trump get, the harder we're going to have to start pushing on those buttons.  Either that or finding tricks to de-escalate/disarm people who do this. I've often wondered what would happen if someone stood up, pointed at Trump and said, ""Hey everyone, look at this! Donald Trump actually believes the photoshopped MS13 photo is real."" and when he gets made about it, talk to him patronizingly. Maybe just say ""Do you realize you're yelling right now? Why are you yelling?""",Such-Let974,2025-05-05T17:53:28,3

"My 81-year old dad knows that he's retired, but his damaged brain doesn't understand that.  On weekdays during business hours, he's a squirming, fidgety mess.  Once dinnertime hits, he immediately calms down and behaves semi-reasonably.  He thinks he's supposed to be doing something but doesn't know what, so he acts like he's on meth or something and just zooms around doing random stuff and panicking.  He'll go to the grocery store, but acts like he's in a hurry to get back to work and will do stuff like get impatient and start turning a few feet before there's actually a place to turn because he can't wait or blow through stop signs.  He can remember his regular stuff in the store, but if I asked him to get a box of Saltines he couldn't do it.  One time we were picking up a pie for Thanksgiving and he had to pick it up from a different spot than where he was used to.  He started screaming, ""HELP! HELP!"" at the top of his lungs, even though I was physically grabbing his shirt and tugging him to the correct spot while loudly telling him it was okay and there were pies literally a foot away from us in the case, but he was too panicked to hear me.  Five employees came *running* over in a panic because the way he was screaming, you'd think his arm just got chopped off in a meat slicer.  He immediately calmed down on seeing white men coming to help and started loudly complaining about how dumb the layout was and how it was nice to see people ""like them"" working who could understand what he wanted instead of being from ""Indonesia"" (he means India but has nominal aphasia).  He continued about as normal, for him at least, after this like absolutely nothing had happened.  Then when we got to the checkout, there was a person in front of us so my dad started making motor sounds and spinning around in circles until it was his turn, then he started screaming in the cashier's face about the wait and prices of groceries.  I would bet money Trump acts the exact same; every time I read articles about his dementia symptoms, it reminds me so much of my dad.  The ""restlessness"" causes a shit ton of other problems.  People like them have no business even answering their phones without a babysitter, let alone the whole fucking country.",TheAlphaKiller17,2025-05-05T16:10:21,110

"I think you’re right about his days being numbered. He’s backed himself into a corner with the tariff thing and he can’t get out of it. He promised the Carthartt wearing MAGA’s that filled those rallies in rust belt states that he was going to bring back manufacturing jobs. Those people are the reason he has power. They’re the ones that stormed the capitol for him and put the fear of God into every Republican that didn’t fall in line. He promised them in particular a return to the “Golden age”. A return to the days when a white guy could drop out of high school and walk down the street and immediately get hired on at the factory making middle class wages. He promised them he was going to “Make America Great Again” and tariffs and deporting Mexicans was supposed to do it. All the other promises he made were minor. Those people want the jobs that they think Mexico and China stole from them and they don’t want to have to do anything to get them back. The higher prices and empty shelves were never part of the deal. When they see Trump can’t deliver on that major promise of his MAGA agenda, the only promise they really are clinging to, then they’re going to be pissed and he can’t blame RINO’s or Democrats.

The effects and disruption of the Trump tariffs will bring pain and have the potential to cause extreme harm that MAGA will need to reckon with, once someone in the GOP sniffs out that Trump is a losing proposition and turns on him to save his political life I believe you will see a very quick and sharp eroding of support for Trump as the GOP moves toward a life without him, resulting in a very quick decline in Trump’s health as well.

I guarantee he's working up all the bills he needs to get passed and is shopping them around to whomever he can find to introduce them and shepherd them through into law.,NinjaLanternShark,2025-05-05T18:45:41,2

"On the doctor thing, they can't discuss it with you or tell you anything, but you can tell the doctor stuff and that can be taken into consideration when treating him. You can try phone, but I found it works better to write a letter and pass it on to the receptionist to get to the right eyes. Email might also work, but don't expect a reply or an update. It's alright to tell the receptionist that the letter is about him and to please pass it on to anyone who needs to see it. They are not likely to tell you what doctors are on the case or even if he's a patient with them for hippa reasons. It's like calling in an anonymous tip, and the letter won't be assumed to be the truth but it can give a hint about what needs investigation, probably your dad would not mention the things he's struggling with",superpandapear,2025-05-05T22:57:13,4

He learned what he could get away with in his first term and learned that he can do a lot of illegal stuff and not get in trouble for it. Now he is learning that he can really push the line in the sand with the courts because they will drag the process out and the GOP will roll over and let him be the bull in a china shop.,YellowZx5,2025-05-05T19:49:19,3
"Make no mistake, that's not Trump picking loyalists, that's Stephen ""Ghoulfucker"" Miller. Trump still makes dipshit picks. He's not smart enough to even pick loyalists, he just expects everybody to be loyal until they're not. If it were up to Trump, he'd pick all attractive people he saw on TV because he doesn't have a fucking clue what's real and what's Hollywood. Hell, they managed to convince him that he's a successful businessman.  Ghoulfucker is smart enough to pick people he knows will suck Trump's dick for the chance at power.
