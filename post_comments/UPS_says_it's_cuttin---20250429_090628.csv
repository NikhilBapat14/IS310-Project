"# Look at all this winning!!   * **Federal jobs:** illegally fired, hiring freeze * **State, local, nonprofit, and public sector jobs:** hundreds of thousands laid off from grant funding freezes * **Academia:** laid off from grant funding freezes * **Private sector:** laying everyone off due to tarrifs, upcoming recession, and shareholder prioritization  *When do we say ""****shareholders shouldn't be prioritized""*** contrary to the Reagan-advice given decades ago? It's not even current with modern society. It clearly isn't working. Citizens United is clearly not representative of the united citizenship. Industrial united sounds like a better rename.   When everyone is fired? **What then?** When nobody can pay for food? **What then?**  **Do the industrialists and their lackeys know that they will not be spared?** You're working with **psychopaths, sociopaths, and criminals**. Eventually, they're going to get tired of you***. Look at the cartel and mafia: nobody is loyal to anyone but their own family.*** That holds true with the GOP/DOGE/Elon. They're going to eventually turn on you when they need to satisfy themselves.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-29T09:15:10,1

"I haven't even gone on these sites since the whole tariff chaos began. It's going to get a lot worse because they're still selling product prior to the ""reciprocal"" tariffs and some even before the feb 4th and march tariffs.   I've resigned to simply buying as little as possible: toiletries, gas and food. That's it.   No matter who makes it and where, there's going to be raw material and components made outside the USA.  *And the GN documentary with PC component manufacturers was eye-opening. A lot of people are going to lose their jobs and these companies that primarily assemble and sell to the US are looking into foreign markets.",krozarEQ,2025-04-29T09:14:20,1

"Could someone smarter than me please clarify this? Does this mean that Amazon is forecasting a 50% drop in business over the next two years? Is Amazon planning to transition more to their own personal delivery service?  While I see that the reduction in Amazon deliveries would directly contribute to a decrease of revenue for UPS, it looks like this was a cost saving decision for UPS rather than a drop in business from Amazon.  It just seems like, while true, this is a bit of a misleading headline.",SharpNSlick,2025-04-29T09:33:22,1

"More like the public's ignorance. They fell for the oldest propaganda in the book. There's zero excuse for ignorance and unwise thinking in the 21st century.   You can't say ""biden's arrogance"" when Canada saw that the Conservative pick was a bad choice and that he would, in fact, completely ruin Canada in the same manner America was ruined. They immediately voted against a populist demagogue.   The same industrial forces supporting the Conservatives are going after Australia this Saturday, and then New Zealand. It's almost like there's a global industrial collusion network. Shocking.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-29T09:19:28,1

"You're a russian shill. Your english sucks and you have the same rhetoric of blaming the democratic party, which by the way, is the **most** conservative of all first-world countries relatively speaking. If moderate dems were the GOP and progressives were the new Dems, then whatever. That isn't what's happening though.  You, the voter, vote. If you don't make educated votes, you give up your civic power. Politics is the 7000+ year game of ""power relationships of individual and entity"".   If you don't vote, I just assume you don't fight back if someone assaulted you.  If you make an uninformed or a single-issue vote, you probably don't use condoms.   In both cases, you just sleep around and don't care what happens to you or those around you. Disgusting behavior.",happyfundtimes,2025-04-29T09:31:11,1
"Yes, people are oversimplifying and using ‚Äúknew-it-all-along‚Äù bias looking at this.   Let me start by saying our predicament is dire and I wish things went the other way.   People vote for different reasons. My parents are the nicest people you could ever hope to meet but they voted for him. Are they evil? Are they fascists? No. This is just how history unfolded. People were dying financially after Biden was in office.   The key now is GETTING TRUMP OUT.",JIMMY_RUSTLING_9000,2025-04-29T09:30:40,1
