">It does not include resources that are already a source of revenue for the Ukrainian state. In other words, any profits under the deal are dependent on the success of new investments...         >Officials have also emphasized that the agreement ensures full ownership of the resources remains with Ukraine, and the state will determine what can be extracted and where.       Also, this agreement will only work if russia is fully kicked out of the country.     Honestly, I don't hate it.  Obviously, the best choice would have been to just help them since this is the first obviously moral war the US had been in since WWII.     But if this is the motivation republicans need to do the right thing, it works.",amateur_mistake,2025-05-01T09:40:54,5
It includes extortion I’m sure.,Luke_Cocksucker,2025-05-01T09:08:36,8
The deal actually seems pretty fair on both sides. Exceedingly rare Trump W,PerceptionThen7393,2025-05-01T09:00:15,3
Definitely. Lots and lots of extortion.,UnabashedHonesty,2025-05-01T09:16:57,6
"That tells me Trump himself probably had zero involvement in the negotiations, then.",DocShocker,2025-05-01T09:19:35,6
Only if you don’t factor in all of the additional people who were killed while Trump withheld weapons and aid.  Just standard negotiating tactics though right? To abandon support for an ally who is actively being invaded and then leverage that for a better “deal”. What’s a little human suffering between friends?,Sad_Confection5902,2025-05-01T09:33:31,8
>To abandon support for an ally who is actively being invaded and then leverage that for a better “deal”.      Which was also us actively breaking a previous treaty we signed.   We are only as good as our word.  So not great.,amateur_mistake,2025-05-01T09:35:23,3
"Can kind of see where he's coming from, even if I don't fully agree. US already gave $120bn to Ukraine, compared to \~$140bn (figures seem to vary) from every European country combined. It seems fair if they want something out of this, given that the threat is much further from them, and they are almost matching the combined efforts of all of Europe.",PerceptionThen7393,2025-05-01T10:34:31,1
"I also wholly expect Trump to ridicule this deal later, and back out of it, blaming Biden and Democrats for terms he negotiated himself.",chrisagiddings,2025-05-01T09:57:26,1
