A brutal hearing where he will still be confirmed by the narrowest of margins.,The_Path_616,2025-05-05T02:52:05,105
I've honestly lost faith in these political hearings since Brett Kavanaugh spoke about liking beer and Graham apologized to him because his colleagues were asking him relevant questions.,Mr-ReDiCulouZ,2025-05-05T02:16:28,55
But will still be confirmed,toughturtle,2025-05-05T06:14:34,14
...and then be confirmed,Scullyitzme,2025-05-05T08:15:49,10
"""We'll ask him hard questions which he'll either ignore or brazenly lie in response to, and then he'll be confirmed along with almost half of the democratic caucus voting for him, and then I'll write a sternly worded rebuke in a fundraising email""  Sound about right?",homesickalien337,2025-05-05T07:42:04,10
"Big deal. He’ll be grilled and won’t lose a minutes sleep over it and then be confirmed and tomorrow we’ll be taking about Trump wanting to annex some obscure country or changing the name of lake, city, fort, etc.",Impressive_Ad_5614,2025-05-05T06:58:52,4

Does it matter? He could sit there listening to music and still be confirmed,ztreHdrahciR,2025-05-05T08:20:41,3
That won't happen.  Waltz will lie his ass off and get shoed in by the MAGATs.,nwgdad,2025-05-05T09:33:38,2
"She’s picking this fight because she doesn’t want to stand up against what the administration is actually doing. Waltz or somebody else, the main job will be to tell the UN to fuck off, we’re gonna keep sending bombs to drop on Gaza, keep helping Israel block aid from getting in. And Duckworth et al don’t have any problem with that.",heech441,2025-05-05T03:26:39,2

"Duckworth can STFU after siding with trump on his choice for Ambassador to China. She'll vote to confirm, as we all know, no matter what happens.  She is a bootlicking traitor and as a constituent I'm done with her.",_Uber_Otter_,2025-05-05T08:41:50,1

"Exactly.  Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.  We don't abide our own laws - like the Leahy Law - never mind  international agreements and statutes.  Let's have a 'brutal hearing' on THAT.  All we've done lately is threaten the UN, not support or improve it.  Trump and his SCOTUS cronies would rather claw back UNJUSTIFIED grisly emergency measures from pre-Civil-War days than abide by legislation on the books.   We have become evil to the core in all govt branches.  Making an example of a Trump clown won't fix that.  And didn't Trump have Oscar-Winning drama queen Elise ""Super Karen"" Stefanik slated for this role before the GOP house-of-cards started to tumble?  When do her McCarthy-esque TV-shows start again?  Has she figured out coPresident Musk is the main engine fueling anti-semitic hate speech in the country ...?  NOPE.  That wouldn't achieve her goal of replacing all US University chiefs with obsequious MAGA quislings.  Who cares about actual anti-semitism?  The same ones who condone islamophobia?",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-05T03:50:42,2
