Grassley is too old for this. He needs to retire.  I will at least give him credit for showing up for town halls. Most of his peers are cowering fully.,KilroyLeges,2025-04-23T17:20:18,20
As reported by Mark Van Cleave and Hannah Fingerhut.  Not sure why I find these names funny but I do.   It's been a long 3 months.,biscuitarse,2025-04-23T18:09:35,6
">“I’ve had enough of you Democrats,” she said to jeers and retorts from her neighbors.  By ""Democrats"" she meant ""Patriots."" That word includes Democrats and citizens with no party affiliation, which is the majority.",Still_Mix3277,2025-04-23T17:24:57,12
Tough crowd if you're full of bullshit!!!,Troubled202,2025-04-23T18:16:19,6
ALL of these republicans are holding town halls to tell their constituents how it’s going to be instead of listening.  Maybe one day republicans will serve their constituents again.,Lost_Minds_Think,2025-04-23T17:28:15,8
"This guy is the worst, but you gotta respect him going out and doing ANOTHER one of these after getting yelled at the last time. You don’t often see a 284 year old out there doing this kind of stuff.   (I checked he was actually born a few months after Herbert Hoover left office.)",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-23T17:29:48,7
One of these days the senator won't walk out. At least he showed up. Johnson told them all to be cowards.,HaveNoFearDomIsHere,2025-04-23T17:29:19,2
I thought Evil Ned Flanders ordered Republican legislators to stop holding town halls.,Machiavvelli3060,2025-04-23T17:33:02,1

Bullshit.  Grassley was in on the coup last time.  Why else was he telling a newspaper on Jan 5 that he'd be counting the electoral votes because he didn't expect Pence to show?,SortByCont,2025-04-23T17:49:10,19
Grassley was literally supposed to be a part of the coup on Jan 6.  You sure about that?,Stinkycheese8001,2025-04-23T17:56:34,12
"No. I'm an Iowan, and Grassley has always toed the Republican party line.",AsamaMaru,2025-04-23T17:35:08,12
What makes you believe that?,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-23T17:38:39,1
Because that’s what he was told.,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T18:01:45,-5
In that if he recused himself he was president pro tem? Yeah.,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T18:36:38,-1
Well let me ask you. Is the Republican Party toeing the Republican line right now?,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T18:00:28,-2

"There's no version of ""Hey, we need you to cover for Pence, we don't expect him to show for his only constitutional duty"" that doesn't prompt a ""Huh, really?  Why?  Is he OK?"" Unless you're in on what was planned for the next day",SortByCont,2025-04-23T18:07:05,10
"Did you just make that up?  Mike Pence was pretty famously there at the time, in case you didn’t notice.  But Grassley DID announce ahead of time that Pence would be skipping (unbeknownst to Pence) and that Grassley would be stepping in.  “And we don’t expect him to be here”.  Sorry to burst your bubble that you think Chuck Grassley would have been your Republican savior.",Stinkycheese8001,2025-04-23T18:49:35,4
There is no Republican party any longer. There's only MAGA. That's why Grassley doesn't fit in any more. He still thinks there is a Republican party.,AsamaMaru,2025-04-23T18:02:44,9
> Is the Republican Party toeing the Republican line right now?  Yes.   What's happening now is what the republican party has been working towards since the Powell memo was released back in 71.,Cat_herder_81,2025-04-23T18:51:00,3
Yes,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-23T18:37:22,-2
