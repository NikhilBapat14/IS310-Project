"There are a lot of Republicans who want to run for POTUS and need to differentiate themselves from Trump and each other - especially because Trump will try and destroy anyone running for the Presidency.  The GOP consists of multiple factions increasingly at odds with other. When Trump's grip loosens these factions will split and their leading personalities will compete for the spotlight and to get their members into the House and Senate.  Trump's approval is plummeting and the real effects of the tariffs haven't even begun. His grip is the only thing that keeps the GOP united. The GOP is united under him out of fear of his ability to destroy any of them individually.
