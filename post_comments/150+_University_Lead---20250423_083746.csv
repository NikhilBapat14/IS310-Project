Any university that capitulated failed the entire idea of why they exist in the first place. I hope Columbia attendance numbers fall off a cliff and force a purge of those staff members who are complicit.,FahrenheitGhost,2025-04-23T08:41:14,8
Bending....Begging.....being Bamboozled by this administration is NOT a good way to elevate your educational institution.  You will have to scrub that orange stain for YEARS.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-23T08:58:42,2

Oh Gee! That will show him! The old cruel effective ‘we denounce this!’ Works right alongside the ol’ ‘we are outraged!’ ‘This is completely unacceptable!’ And lest we forget the always present ‘He can’t do that! That’s why we have the Constitution!’   What the fuck man?  This ass hat has ZERO respect for literally anything.  Keep on Denouncing you spineless god damn cucks!,LuckySchmuckie,2025-04-23T08:44:05,-2

"I wish my uni pres had signed it. Unlike the schools with signatories, we currently have no protections for free speech or to do the research we are trained to do. Students, citizens or not, have no protection from ICE. We are being told that Trump will decide what we are allowed to teach and research. So, that statement actually means something. It’s not everything, but it’s saying the Constitution matters.",TuffyButters,2025-04-23T09:04:19,2
