MAGA is at a weird intersection of being antisemitic and pro-Israel right now and having an identity crisis.,A1sauc3d,2025-05-05T16:01:42,62
Everyone should defend that right.  It's protected by the first amendment.,BlotchComics,2025-05-05T16:01:50,19
"...I really don't like the fact that I'm agreeing with those in the MAGA movement, but when they're right, they're right.",jayfeather31,2025-05-05T16:05:33,14
Congrats to the Democratic Party that made us root for MAGA and made MTG sound more sane than most of them. Great job!,brasdontfit1234,2025-05-05T16:25:49,7

"Boycotting the STATE and GOVERNMENT of Israel for it's war crimes, or for any reason other than ""because they're jewish"" is NOT antisemetism good lord.   I love my jewish American friends and neighbors. I am a little guarded now when someone says they are from Israel, i immediately wonder if they condone the genocide happening over there.   Stop killing the women and children. I hope Netanyahu dies at the bottom of a dark hole, alone and afraid.",Apprehensive-Knee379,2025-05-05T16:55:05,7

they will just sneak it into another bill. time to end any relationship with israel and arrest AIPAC as a hostile terrorist organization. the money of U.S. citizens should not be stolen to support a hostile foreign terrorist state.,graywailer,2025-05-05T16:22:27,5
"I...wait. Hold on. Wasn't it ""illegal"" to support Palestine and boycott Israel a few days ago?   This feels like a trap. Are there actually some MAGATS left that do value free speech and the 1st amendment?  I'm confused.",NihilisticPollyanna,2025-05-05T16:08:43,2

Even the pro Israel evangelicals are anti semites. They support Israel because Israel is necessary to rebuild the 3rd temple and trigger End times prophecy. They want Jesus to return and all Jews must recognize the 2nd coming as their Messiah or be slaughtered.,Apathetic_Zealot,2025-05-05T16:08:34,32

"Gotta say, I'm extremely extremely skeptical about this.  They're defending this because they're going to use this ""freedom"" in a terrible way.  So many loopholes get shoved into ""reasonable"" bills.",0002millertime,2025-05-05T16:03:45,1

"Wouldn't it be hilarious if that all came to pass, and when Jesus came down, he took one look at the evangelicals and said, ""yeah, none of you are worthy, Rapture's over, go to hell."" And then life goes on as normal, except now everyone knows we're so fucked that even Jesus gave up on us.",LordSiravant,2025-05-05T18:12:44,3
"Christian Zionism is weeeeeird, even weirder when you look at the mental gymnastics practiced by the likes of Billy Graham, et al, who probably never trusted Israelis but were willing to look the other way because the opposition was the Soviets. And brown people.",DudeWhereIsMyDuduk,2025-05-05T19:43:57,2
"The difference between MAGA leadership and the MAGA base is like the difference between Trump's bank account size and his base's bank account size.  The Evangelical part of his base only tolerates Jews because [Israel is necessary to build the Third Temple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Temple) for the Antichrist to defile, but Revelation says they'll be exterminated if they don't convert.  Trump's Jewish family has a part in the End times.  According to End Times Evangelicals like Ted Hagee, [the Antichrist is supposed to be partially Jewish and homosexual](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pastor-hagee-the-antichri_b_104608) (I don't know where they get the last part).  That [Kushner owned 666 5th Avenue](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/23/politics/charles-jared-kushner-666-fifth-avenue) says one of his kids will be the defiler.  Ivanka converted to Judaism so their kids are Jewish, or partially Jewish, depending on how you look at it.  End Times Evangelicals have long taken an ""ends justify the means"" approach to morality, accumulating wealth and power, and abandoning the teachings of Jesus.  The Evangelicals will be the Christians that gleefully follow the Antichrist, as they're gleefully following the incredibly immoral Trump.  They think they'll be Raptured for their efforts in causing the Apocalypse and killing 2/3 of the people of the earth, and they'll be surprised when their reward is the lake of fire.  In the meantime, per Revelation, I predict the Evangelicals will persecute real Christians who still follow the teachings of Jesus.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-05-05T17:38:18,6

"What I observed in the article was a fear of how it would be enforced. One of them opposing the bill said something to the effect of “how many products would I need in my home to be considered compliant? Is leaving an Israeli product outside my home the modern day version of lambs blood on my door to save me and my family?” There was also mention of “being unable to go against the first amendment” and MTG mentioned something about why they’re voting on another country’s influence as opposed to focusing on bills that affect U.S, and “Americans”",fartbutt6942069,2025-05-05T18:02:09,3

"As a New Jerseyan, I can’t tell you how much I hate Josh Gottheimer.
