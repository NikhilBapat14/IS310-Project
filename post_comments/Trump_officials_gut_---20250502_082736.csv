"At some point, we may have to face the fact that the President of the United States is deliberately damaging the country in an attempt to make America worse. As awful as that is to contemplate, it certainly makes choices like this - and the shuttering of labs that cure disease, the ending of social programs that save lives, etc - make a heck of a lot more sense.",DoubleHurricane,2025-05-02T14:55:17,4

"False. They just let everything get to the point where you need private industry to clean the water and the air. That means you’ve got to pay for it. When the FDA is gone you’ll still be able to find food that has high quality standards, but you’ll pay more for it. People will want *someone* to provide these services. Communities will pool resources, it’ll shift tax burdens around, but instead of services coming from federal workers, local governments will have to pay private industry.",GenerationalNeurosis,2025-05-02T18:40:02,2
