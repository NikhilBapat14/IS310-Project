">In the wake of the memo, the committee’s ranking member, [Sen. Richard Blumenthal](https://www.cnbc.com/richard-blumenthal/) of Connecticut, **sent letters to the five Musk-led companies asking them to provide information on the federal investigations they faced prior to Trump’s inauguration.**  >The letters also request a rundown of the steps each company has taken to keep Musk’s government work separate from those probes. Blumenthal asks the companies to respond by May 11.  >**The White House sharply rejected any suggestion that Musk has used his role in government for “personal or financial gain,**” saying “any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory.”  >**Blumenthal “is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has wilted his brain,”** White House communications director Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement.  They don't care what anyone asks or says, they don't care if they are breaking rules or constitutional rights, they NEVER have any consequences and until they do they are going to run rampant over any government sanity.

"…which was why doge targeted the agencies and panels and experts and regulators that it did. It was never ever about saving a dime. It was about keeping Elon afloat, while funneling contracts and sweet sweet government funding into spaceX and away from his competitors.  And after he was done, he was always going to “take a step back” so he could expand spaceX and tesla. I dont think he anticipated *everyone* ditching tesla and the 71%+ (and falling) revenue. To avoid having X taken from him from tesla’s value plummeting (because he took a loan to buy X using tesla as leverage) he had X sold to himself so he could get out from under that achilles heel.
