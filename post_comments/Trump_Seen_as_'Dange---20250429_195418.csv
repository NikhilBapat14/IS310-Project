I think the most dangerous thing about him is that he is shattering the illusion of the protection of democracy. It is becoming increasingly clear almost nothing in our society means anything anymore.  * He's a convicted felon that got off free. * He ignores court orders and nothing is done. * His administration is tearing apart our institutions and nothing is being done about it. * He is violating the constitution in multiple ways from obstructing the freedom of the press to ignoring due process.  I don't see how we reasonably bounce back from this as a democracy. Even if the next president has the same ideology as FDR our constitution needs massive reforms.,-CJF-,2025-04-29T20:05:47,76

Trump said that if he was voted back into office that no one would have to vote again. Considering he’s moved into full banana republic dictator mode this comment from back then needs serious thought. I don’t think he’s ever planning to leave the white house.

"FROM THE ACTUAL STUDY:  Relatively few voters regret their decision in November; however, three in ten non-voters regret not turning out to vote last fall.  Nearly all Americans who voted for Kamala Harris (95%) and Donald Trump (92%) are satisfied with their decision to vote or how they voted, as well as 85% of those who voted for another candidate.  Thirty-one percent of non-voting Americans say they regret their decision not to vote, compared with 56% who say they are satisfied.   - This is so much worse than the article makes it out to be. How the hell can 85% of people who voter for neither Trump or Harris be ""satisfied with their vote""? HOW CAN 56% OF NON-VOTERS BE SATISFIED WITH NOT VOTING, despite a majority of non-voters also see Trump as a dangerous dictator? What the fuck goes on in the heads of non-voters?

"Definitely agreed on the illusion of democracy. Though I think it's less a Constitution problem, and more the structures built around upholding it, both legal/political and social/cultural.   We have learned way too much of our governance relies on decorum, norms and gentlemen ageeements vs actual consequences for violations from the highest office.   The executive branch is ""supposed to"" defer to and follow rulings by the juidicial - and when it doesn't then what? Right now evidently it can ""investigate"" itself and find no wrongdoings, all while gaslighting the public.  Which is where the other issue lies, the public.   A functioning democracy assumes its citizens are accurately informed, participate, and make rational decisions based on their interests. None of that is happening. Way too many Americans don't understand the Constitution, their own and others' rights, how our government should work, media literacy etc. and some are proud of that.

A highly controversial effort, partly funded by Dunn, it represents one of the best hopes for Christian nationalists, among other interested parties, who want to transform the laws of the land in one fell swoop. ‘When we started the Convention of States — and I was there at the beginning — I knew we had to have a spiritual revival, a Great Awakening and a political restoration for our country to come back to its roots,’ Dunn said at a 2019 summit for the group, where he spoke alongside Barton. ‘What I did not expect is that the Convention of States would be an organization that would trigger that Great Awakening.’”  “Yet nothing in Article V limits the scope of the laws that might be changed.  ‘It’s a gamble, but if it pays off, it would be the biggest opportunity ever for billionaires to transform the government,’ Montgomery, the researcher of the religious right, said.“",Arrmadillo,2025-05-01T10:37:22,1

"Okay, I slightly misremembered a few details, but the coalition got very close to happening on several occasions, and Zentrum was responsible for joining in on the passing of the Enabling Act (which required 2/3rds of the Reichstag). Zentrum also joined with the NSDAP to make Göring the President of the Reichstag; this is the incident which I misremembered as a formal coalition (this is effectively one step away from a coalition).  Hindenburg had appointed Papen (then a Zentrum politician) as Chancellor with the objective of creating a possible coalition between Zentrum and the NSDAP. Zentrum did attempt to kick him out of the party in response, as he would be replacing Brüning (a senior Zentrum politician) as Chanceller, but Papen quit Zentrum before they could do so. So that's the first Zentrum-Nazi coalition attempt failed.  Papen, then with only an extreme minority government with backing only from the DNVP (and whatever remained of the post-Stresemann DVP) had the Reichstag dissolved to trigger the July 1932 elections. The NSDAP became the largest party after this, and Zentrum began negotiations with the Nazis to form a majority coalition to oust Papen. Ironically, Brüning (along with Kaas) was now the one negotiating for an NSDAP-Zentrum-BVP coalition. As part of these negotiations, Zentrum voted for Göring as the Reichstag President (he would be the last person to ever hold this position).  Despite the fact that Papen had already been replaced by Schleicher, negotiations between Zentrum and the NSDAP continued after the November 1932 elections, since this was seen as the only viable way to return to a majority government.   Papen, wanting to oust Schleicher (who replaced him as Chancellor), then negotiated with Hitler to sidestep Zentrum with a minority NSDAP-DNVP coalition bolstered by independents. Under this agreement, Papen would be Vice-Chancellor and Hitler would be Chancellor, but Papen arrogantly believed that he would be able to hold Hitler under his own control.  Hitler no longer needed Zentrum for a majority after the 1933 election, but when he wanted to pass the Enabling Act, he required the Zentrum vote to reach 2/3rds of the Reichstag vote.",quildtide,2025-04-30T11:50:50,1

"Yeah, I always have doubts when I hear that ""everyone was against the Iraq War when it started"" or ""everyone knew it was a lie"" (well, ok everyone knew the nuclear threat was a lie). It's just not the case. It was certainly controversial and there was opposition, but the war drums and propaganda were in effect and got the public mostly on Dubya's side. It had fallen in popularity and was more or less a 50/50 issue  come the 2004 election.",mitrie,2025-04-29T21:53:46,6
Most companies pressure you to click through your training ASAP.,TwilightBubble,2025-04-29T23:56:57,8
"Man, that's unsettling.  And since we work with economics, commerce, and ultimately the ""proper"" distribution of prosperity (which I highly disagree with as a premise) - it's not like we can just avoid it.  A concept I'm sure you're way more familiar with than I.  Regardless I'm glad I got to read of your experience.  All the more reason to emphasize rationale and logic, just as much as empathy, compassion, and honor.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-29T23:36:27,4
"Yup, I got a finance masters and it really opened my eyes. I worked in accounting for about 5 years to get my savings up then quit to become a lettuce farmer. I thought accounting would be less evil than finance and I did end in a fairly ethical position doing accounting for the city's head start. Glad I was gone though before all the budget/grant cuts. I don't want to think about how people swing money around anymore. It's awful for my mental health. I would rather be at peace and broke than mentally wrecked and wealthy.",Wayrin,2025-04-30T06:14:07,5
"Years ago, at a job I really didn't like at all. (A lot of micromanaging and many other things)  I would milk the hell out of my training for 3 hours. Would normally take me 45 mins or so, but I hated the job and said screw it. When they asked me why it took so long, I said ""Oh I am a very slow reader""",Ilikebirbs,2025-04-30T00:09:22,5
"I remember when I was in the Army and being told, ""If you want to learn this shit learn it on your own time. These classes need to be done now.""",AdUpstairs7106,2025-04-30T00:27:53,3
"An issue I think developed in the adware days myself, but I digress and agree.  An emphasis on learning, even the boring stuff, is how good standards are made.  That's where the pressure should lie, but it never seems to.  All the same, it's something repeatedly overlooked and undervalued.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-30T00:08:16,1
"Well, I can't be expected to feel bad for a company that can always spend a little more on meaningful policy engagement, employee consideration, and not making the environment miserable.  These things, even the more ""expensive"" training?  They've always been business write offs, and lost expenses claims.  Like, it costs them literally next to or entirely nothing to commit to such a plan that would make (in your case persay) for a much more productive workplace.  Silly silly shortsighted people.  You did what you had to.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-30T00:23:24,3
"Can't speak from any personal service, and I understand the necessity of maintaining a cycle of ready troops in a timely manner - but damn, come on now.  How will those temporary bridges for infantry and mobile platforms stand up if it falls to people to do it in their own time?  Like, don't get me wrong - please encourage personal investment and growth in something during someone's spare time, but structure is super important and hones both focus and patternization.  This is especially sad to me because army was my preferred branch if I could join.  Clearly they are not licking enough windows for their required daily vitamin D intake.",FluffyKittenHorde,2025-04-30T00:33:47,1
Oh yeah it was pretty bad.   They had put in timed bathroom breaks and said if you took longer than 15 mins or used the bathroom too much. It was considered your 15 min break (Or lunch) It had pissed off a lot of the employees and they got rid of it that same day.,Ilikebirbs,2025-04-30T15:32:31,1
