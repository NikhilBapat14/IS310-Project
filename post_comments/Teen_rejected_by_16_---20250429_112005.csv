"Kind of weird for him to get rejected from the UC schools.  UC Berkeley might as well be called UC Beijing and they don't call UCLA the University of Caucasians Living in Asia for nothing.  It's like >50% Asian.  Must more to the story.  As a Chinese American myself, I am all for blind admissions.  Assign a number rather than a name to the application and get rid of essays that can be used to identify ethnicity/background.",bw2082,2025-04-29T11:24:08,608

"Not surprised at all.  Big Tech is one of the most skill dependent areas you can get into.  They use a bar hiring system where as long as you are able to perform above the bar during interviews, you will move on, there is very little in terms of opinion in the hiring process. The downside is the process is grueling, 6+ rounds of interviews is standard.  It's why the Asian population actually succeeds so much in big tech, they work hard, grind their butts off and do well in interview after interview, and get hired.",Juicyjackson,2025-04-29T13:31:03,40
"The left has created a system where results don't matter. It's not merely that they don't credit a person for working hard, they don't credit a person for working hard and succeeding objectively - they will still be called a failure in the end because some stooge at a desk won't put his signature on it. Likewise, whomever has that signature is in whether they're competent or not.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-29T11:51:44,53

">""Despite claiming it does not maintain racial targets, UC actively pursues Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) status at all its campuses. HSI designation requires at least 25% Hispanic student enrollment,"" the California complaint states.  They'll absolutely lose if this is true.

Been saying this about hiring people for jobs since the 90's myself.  Blind employment. All you see is achievements. Hell it would be a great new economic sector. Businesses that go beyond Indeed or Monster.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T11:38:03,192
"I think American born asians have the hardest admissions because the ""colleges"" want to dei-in other races and then use the 'asian quota' thats left for foreign-born asians paying even more",newcolours,2025-04-29T15:56:18,23
"This whole ""Asian"" thing is also fucking racist. Just as Liberals labeling people ""Black"" or ""Hispanic"".   As an Argentinian I'm sure you realize that there is a fucking huge difference between Brazilian, Argentinian and Honduran, and the gulf in socio economic and cultural outlook is massive, treating them all as ""Hispanic so they think alike"" is insulting.   Well, it's basically the same thing for ""Asians"" and Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino and Southeast Asian people being grouped together because ""yellow people"". A Filipino guy shouldn't need to have a harder time getting into Harvard because ""Chinese people study harder"" or whatever BS rationale this is based on.",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-29T18:46:55,24

"No way I’m hiring somebody without first doing a deep dive, face to face.   I’ve had candidates across the desk from me who looked perfect on paper, presented well at first - but after half an hour - turn out to be a shiny paint job on a bucket of crap.",cliffotn,2025-04-29T11:44:46,198
I don't know how that would even work.  Who verifies the achievements?  At least with admissions into school there are hard numbers that can be used to compare candidates.,bw2082,2025-04-29T11:50:12,19

">All you see is achievements.   Resumes are largely fake and garbage today, it's all about the interview or the headhunting in tech.  I used to give icebreaker questions that now defeat a lot of college grads.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-29T13:06:00,8

"You don't even have to go that far. Let's just take a bog standard American White Guy.  One could have grown up in the trailer park living hand to mouth, and through sheer grit climbed their way up to making it to college...and the other could have had a silver spoon in their mouth from day one.  But the racist system as it is will punish that rags to riches story just because he's white and a man.  That's the problem with out of touch socialist policies, they lump everyone together based on immutable characteristics...you know..bigotry. Liberals for some reason think that if they sell the lie and shout enough that it makes it not bigotry much like a man getting a sex change somehow makes them not a man.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-29T22:48:04,19
"I've interviewed way too many resume heroes to be willing to hire anyone without a face to face interview. On paper they are amazing, in person they prove how much knowledge they actually lack on anything they claimed on their resume, like not even knowing the basics.",Navy_Chief,2025-04-29T17:33:57,50
"I understand how it works, I have run a small business and had to hire a few people and they seem perfect then turn into total crap.   But even hiring in person, you still can get a turd rather than a diamond.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T11:48:39,45
"It was just an idea. What achievements matter for a job? Does being on the football team mean anything for a Job?  You are looking for a Computer Tech..  Candidate 101   CS Degree with 3.8 GPA   Graduated with BS in CS   Worked Burger King part time while in college.   References are good for requirements by business  Candidate 102   Graduated High School   Worked for Geek Squad for 2 years -- Positive review by manager of Geek Squad   Worked for Small local business for 5 years -- Positive review by manager of business   Reason for looking for job, wants to move into server administration  Which one?    I had a CS degree come in once. I used to give any applicant a test by asking them to diagnose a PC or MAC and they had 15 minutes to give me a report.   The CS degree candidate couldn't turn on the PC because he didn't realize there was a switch ON the power supply as well as the one on the front of the machine.  Nothing is perfect.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T12:04:06,11
But that also means you can't guarantee that if you personally check any of it you can't verify either.  At least my idea eliminates the risk of being accused of racism in hiring by eliminating any traces of the things most companies worry about when they don't hire someone.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T09:59:40,1
">But the racist system as it is will punish that rags to riches story just because he's white and a man.  Did you know that everyone in Europe celebrates St Patrick's Day, Lent *and* Oktoberfest? See, it's all ""white people festivals"", the same way somehow *all black people* celebrate Kwanzaa (nevermind that even people in fucking Africa don't celebrate Kwanzaa which is a made up holiday).",funny_flamethrower,2025-04-30T01:22:34,2
My point is that anyone can put whatever they want on a resume and no one really knows what they did at their previous jobs.  No one can verify if they made $5 million in sales on a $3.5 million quota.  You just have to trust it.,bw2082,2025-04-29T12:07:50,15

">Does being on the football team mean anything for a Job?  Yeah, actually it does if you're hiring a young person.  Shows commitment, ability to work on a team, initiative, and perseverance/grit.  Americans value youth sports tremendously.",Texas103,2025-04-29T15:11:46,6
"I mean, to be honest, I can believe this fully. CS degrees are Computer Science, not Computer Hardware.    Is it a bit absurd that someone would spend that much time working with computers and not, just by proxy, learn that stuff? Yes, it is. But most people are just surviving college, and no CS program I've ever seen focused on desktop operation, it was just code and more code...and usually on a laptop.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-29T22:45:13,1
"Because partial by law, the worst you can do if you are a former boss is just say no comment or such.  BUT having a blind resume, just numbers, like I said, a company takes in the resumes and checks them. They verify employment. The employer can ask the intake company to check on sales numbers. Which I would think if you are looking for someone to be your sales person, that would actually be criteria that is in the profile of Candidate #. Whatever the need of information for the candidate can be part of the job group. Sales, PC repair, plumbing experience, whatever. You can have how much was sales on bids, how fast are they repairing X, there are plenty of things.  Indeed has lots of categories an employer wants... do you know C or C++ or do you know MAC, can you do this, do you know this program etc. I am quite sure for other jobs it is the same way. All my idea does it take away any chance of even subconscious bias. No name, no gender, no ethnicity.  Pure facts of the person.  Like I said, you can hire someone because they feel like a good fit, their resume is great and they had a good interview but they turn out to be duds when actually working. A face to face interview is no guarantee either to successful hiring.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-29T12:24:23,2

CS teaches you to program. Computer Engineering is more about hardware. I imagine all they ever used was a laptop so they would not know about the power button on the PSU. Most CS departments don't even have computers for students.,AppState1981,2025-04-30T07:52:38,2
"The only place I can think of that teaches the Trade of PC repair is ITT tech. Unless something else has come along in the last 40 years.  I am completely self taught and until I retired, I had a computer business for about a decade and a half.  So that means unless you are taught about how to turn something on, you can't figure it out? Did someone teach you about a microwave and how to use it? How about an Iron?   Seems to me an excuse that you weren't taught how to do something and not finding the power switch on a power supply in a PC shows poor troubleshooting skills on top of everything else.  Sorry you don't get hired.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-30T09:57:56,1
"I build all my computers and have since the 90's. Most of our developers would have no clue about a power switch on the PSU. They would just come ask me. Still, I wouldn't hire a CS major to do Tech Support.",AppState1981,2025-04-30T11:50:20,2
