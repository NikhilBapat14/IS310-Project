He‚Äôs not gonna get any better and he‚Äôs just going to push whatever ounce of power he has in that damn position. Feedback is useless if nothing gets done with it.

Politicians actively doing things rather than pretending that all is fine and postponing unpopular reforms.  And finally: everyone in the world seeing how electing a demagogue populist turns out. If that was some less-known country (Hungary for instance), it would go unnoticed.  Trump is the ice bucket that the world needed.

"Guess who's getting investigated next!   1. 60 Minutes just lost their executive producer Bill Owens. Trump filed a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS alleging they unfairly edited a Kamala interview last fall to her advantage. Trump has publicly said CBS News should ""pay a big price"" for airing stories critical of him and is an ""enemy of the people.""   The rumor is that the owner of Paramount is in the middle of selling Paramount to Sundance Media and is considering settling this lawsuit to prevent anything going wrong with her payday and someone needed to take a fall to appease the administration from holding it up. There was even an editorial on the last 60 Minutes claiming that CBS executives are now reviewing/approving stories before airing and the whole team was unhappy about the (forced) resignation and this new potential censorship.  2. The AP was banned from White House events from February through April over refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America, until a federal judge ordered the administration to readmit their reporters earlier this month.   So the administration issued a new policy this month eliminating the guaranteed press pool seat for wire services, so AP now has to compete with all other print reporters for that spot. Those placements are now decided by the WH Press Secretary. The administration removed all power from the WH Correspondents Association to assign press seating in February.    3. On Monday, 3 board members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting were sent emails from the White House that they were fired on behalf of Trump. He does not have that power. So they filed a lawsuit. Add it to the pile.   The CPB funds NPR and PBS, among other media programs, is funded for the next 2 years but Trump is even trying to claw the $1.1 billion in unspent funds back. The CPB was expressly founded in the 1960's to prevent government or corporate control of public media.   In January, the FCC started investigating the CPB for violating rules against commercial ads (the only ""ads"" are their program bumpers that say ""this program was sponsored by X Corporation or Y Foundation"").  MTG forced the CPB to testify in front of DOGE about biased content.   4. The administration ordered all government departments and embassies to cancel all non-professional media subscriptions in February and will have to have all media subscriptions justified and approved on national security merits only (i.e. allowing approval of certain media outlets only). Previously the Washington Post had provided free content to anyone with a .GOV or .MIL email address, presumably by   5. The administration evicted multiple news organizations from dedicated Pentagon office spaces in February, citing they would be now be ""rotated"" among multiple news organizations to be more fair. Most of the ones moving in for this ""rotation"" were conservative, including Breitbart and ONN. Which is probably okay since Hegseth has only given 1 formal news briefing in 100 days, versus a total of 4 Fox News interviews.  6. The administration tried to gut the US Agency for Global Media (Voice of America) in March but a judge ordered a week ago that all employees be reinstated and funding restored. The Voice of America was established to counter Nazi and then communist propaganda against America overseas. It provides weekly news and other content in 50 languages all over the world. The judge denied the reinstatement/funding for Radio Free Europe.",jjmoreta,2025-04-29T17:41:07,1

"I am just going to say what I believe. I am not going to even read the articles critique. I believe that what we admire in a President is something we've cherished in other Presidents. Over the years as an American I've pieced together the year with tidbits that I'd find out after voting, and for the most part play it by ear. This began during the Clinton campaign believing in a unbelievable year after he was signed in to office. We should all know what we've believed to happen. For the last few decades I've had to play everything by ear. I've literally have had no quality time with any politics, and some years have been completely on the dark. There is a light though. At the beginning of Donald Trump's first attempts at being president I've grown accustomed to the silent type of behavior. The point that I'd like to make is that I've turned a deaf ear not out of spite, but because of reality. I can say that the one food thing about Donald Trump is that my complete trust can be with him and is obviously safe. Things are going accordingly.",takenoprisonersnoshi,2025-04-29T21:09:49,-2
">The survey, conducted by NPR/PBS/Marist Poll between April 21 and 23, revealed that 46 percent of registered voter respondents chose ""F"" when asked to grade Trump's performance so far.  So 46% of liberal responders rated him F. This doesn't count the average total with the rest of the liberal voters *or* any conservative voters, who definitely aren't listening to PBS or NPR.  I wouldn't bat an eye if Trump died of old age real soon (trying to avoid an automod ban, as I'm not calling for anything), but we can't be asking people who already hate him to rate him and then be like ""Well see, some of the people who already hate him rated him an F. So that's his raiting."" when in reality, half the country likes what is happening but that's too real of an issue that people want to face.

"> He's united the world (against us)  100%. Canada just re-elected the Liberal Party with a near-majority, just months after it seemed that Poilievre was poised to become Canada's next Prime Minister. Australia may re-elect Labor and effectively give Anthony Albanese another shot.  Unfortunately the rise of right wing populism isn't dead globally. Even with Le Pen being barred from running for public office, Jordan Bardella is the most popular candidate in the next French election according to pollsters, meaning that we could very well see National Rally gain power in two years time. AfD are also tied for the most popular party in Germany, although the likelihood of them gaining power is a bit lower since nobody else is willing to enter a coalition with them. Reform UK are also neck & neck with Labour and the Conservatives in the UK, even after all the damage Brexit and fifteen years of austerity has done to us.  Another thing to note is that Trump's tariffs have made Japan, South Korea and China strengthen diplomatic ties, which is crazy when all three nations have had historic beef with one another.
