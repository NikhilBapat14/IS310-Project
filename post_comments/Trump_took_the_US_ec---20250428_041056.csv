"I see CNN is still parroting Trump's words as fact, not lies.",Joadzilla,2025-04-28T04:21:43,8
"Trump took the *world* to the brink of a crisis in 100 days.  The people put a tantrum-prone child in the driver's seat of the largest truck on the freeway, while all the traffic cops turned away and chose to not look.  Now that child is driving recklessly, causing fear and actual harm, with little actual impediment and absolutely no personal consequences.  This isn't going to solve itself.",whys-it-so-cold,2025-04-28T05:27:34,5
