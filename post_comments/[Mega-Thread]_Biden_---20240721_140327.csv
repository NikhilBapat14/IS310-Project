"Imagine going on a cruise during an election year. üòû  Okay, here's my question: What are the most likely paths Republicans will take to try to disqualify the DNC's new candidate? Will they say it's illegal because filing deadlines have past, or it's illegal to use Joe's campaign funding to support a new candidate? Obviously, it goes without saying that they will do everything in their power to avoid an actual fair election.  I know all the tricks they try to pull in local campaigns, but I'm not as familiar with federal races.",[deleted],2024-07-21T15:47:05,6
"Why are Americans so bad at choosing their candidates?  For example, voters chose Trump in 2016 over Clinton. And Democratic voters chose Clinton in 2016, when Sanders polled better against Trump.   In 2020, Republicans chose Trump again, and Democratic voters chose Biden when there were younger candidates available. And Biden barely won.   This year, Republican voters chose Trump a third time, even though we all know he didn‚Äôt do very well as president. And then Democratic voters chose Biden *again*, even though people complained about his age. It took Democratic leaders to finally stop Biden and make him drop out.   Why did people vote for Biden so many times if they were unsatisfied with him and didn‚Äôt want him? Why do people vote for Trump so many times if people are unsatisfied with him?   Why are Americans so bad at voting? Is it because they think they can‚Äôt vote for anyone else or something like that? Do they actually support who they vote for?",cracksilog,2024-07-22T10:08:16,2
"Could someone who understands all this better than I do explain per the below if a Republican friend of mine is right or wrong regarding this and why?  He's saying:  >""Everyone always knew Biden had cognitive problems so they should have just had an honest primary like democracies should""  >""Dems closed off the primary and selected the candidate in a backroom deal""  >""Everyone always knew Biden wasn't the man he was, but they propped him up only so that party leaders could later undemocratically 'select' the candidate rather than leaving it up to the people""  He thinks it's all a planned conspiracy by Dems who set Biden up knowing he would fail at the debate so that later the Dems party leaders could meet in a backroom and undemocratically install the candidate they wanted.  That may or may not sound absurd however a lot of Republicans are thinking this way (even Rep. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is spreading similar ideas).  Please excuse me as I realize I may be doing the equivalent walking up to a bunch of PhD's and asking them to explain to me why the Earth is or isn't flat.",nitroidshock,2024-07-24T17:19:48,1
"Question: is there any source for the DEI hire claims about Kamala Harris?  This talking point has been surging in conservative media the last few days, and I want to know if there‚Äôs even a kernel of truth to it. The main claim is that Biden originally was specifically looking for a woman of colour as a VP pick back in 2020, possibly involving a deal with Bernie Sanders? I don‚Äôt think whether or not that‚Äôs true really impacts her potential candidacy in 2024, but I‚Äôd like to know if there actually was a focus on that back then.   I haven‚Äôt been able to find any concrete source for this claim, and looking it up is particularly difficult because it‚Äôs diluted by peoiiple talking about the recent claims, and none of them have a source. So, if anyone could point me to any real comments made by Biden or someone close to him that indicates this is true, that would be great. Currently it looks completely fabricated, though.",jane_thornD,2024-07-24T22:25:18,1
If Harris wins does she do the VP electoral count or does someone else? Like does Pres Biden have to step in or speaker of the house since she would be certifying her own win otherwise? Or is this a procedure that such independence does not make a difference?,karsh36,2024-07-25T10:42:56,1

"My thesis is that this has to do with first past the post as the root cause. The archaic voting system of the US forces a 2 party system over time, and that causes both parties to be huge tents, for the lack of a better word.  These tents have to pick candidates that every su group in the tent can accept - if the leftist bloc of the democratic party, for example, vetoes the presidential nominees and stays home, that's curtains for that election.  So the parties end up fielding candidates that cannot have strong principles other than ""I wanna win"" - this causes the current state.",NuclearVII,2024-07-22T11:22:29,3
"I don't actually think the US is bad at choosing candidates at all. Head to head polling in the early phases of a primary season is notoriously unreliable. Yes, Sanders was more likeable than Clinton, but also Clinton kept winning primaries, so she actually got votes Sanders couldn't get. Biden barely won in 2020, but he was also the first person to unseat a sitting incumbent in nearly 30 years. It's MUCH harder to do that than people realize. And Biden consistently was the most reliable performer in polls throughout the entirety of the 2020 race.  Trump this year was an interesting choice, but that's largely because during Trump's term, he intentionally pursued a massive brain drain of talent, making sure the remaining party members either supported him or retired. We've had a record number of retirements in the GOP recently. Trump wouldn't have been nominated if he hadn't intentionally removed the party's capability to operate outside of himself.  Biden got nominated again this year because he was consistently showing himself to be the best candidate available. It looks now like Harris is the most likely to take over, but pre-debate, Harris was seen as a completely unviable candidate. Biden just performed better than her, and everyone else, in any meaningful way. The fact that he flubbed the debate and the entire party lost its mind about it doesn't really change that Biden was clearly the best candidate to nominate, despite the concerns related to his age. It's still not clear at all that removing him was the best decision. We almost never see this idea actually work.  So in other words, actually the parties mostly do a good job nominating the right candidate. Clinton would have won if Comey hadn't completely ruined her chances with his ridiculous investigation one week before the election. Trump only got nominated again because he intentionally damaged the quality of his own party to serve his personal ends.  If anything, the big issue here is that the way American elections are scheduled, it creates a very weird pattern that doesn't necessarily tie in with the feedback loops of voters. For example, the incumbent party NEVER wins a midterm no matter how effective their administration is. Ever. That's not a good thing. Similarly, presidential term limits create a kind of ""give them 8 years then move on"" effect in voters' minds. Part of the reason we defer to incumbents so much is because there's this cultural understanding that a person gets 2 terms to give it a shot, and after that we change. 2016 would have been an uphill battle for ANY Dem because Obama was popular and had the most support of anyone in America, but he was forced to step aside, which meant the Dems were in a weird position where any candidate would have been a step down in terms of support, which amplified the inadequacies of anyone following. I very much think the idea of getting rid of presidential term limits is a good idea because it would enable a good politician that still has popular support to keep serving, while a bad one would be forced to step aside just like we saw with Biden. Creating a system where we can't support who we really want to support and have to gamify our own voting behavior isn't a tremendously healthy situation.",mormagils,2024-07-22T12:09:26,3
"People in general aren't that good at voting, perhaps you're just more aware of america because of how much press it gets.  Biden may be old, but he did a pretty good job.  Just because people were complaining about his age doesn't mean they were always correct; sure they seem to be correct now, but there's always people complainin gabout thinsg unreasonably, so it's hard to tell the dfiference.  People weren't unsatisfied with Biden.  Sanders might've done well, or migh'tve done horribly if he was the nominee; Sanders enjoys not being attacked as much due to his position, but if he were the dem nominee, he'd attract a lot more attacks than usual.  There are a variety of other points that could be argued as well; the basic issue bein gthat you thesis statement is incorrect, and hence the conclusions from it are unreliable.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-22T12:45:59,2
"In 2016 Clinton won the popular vote, it was the electoral college that isn't truly balanced on population that gave Trump his win. Also there was an investigation announcement by the FBI over Clinton right before the election that ended up being nothing.   For Bernie: We had leaked emails show that the DNC overrode Bernie to give the nomination for Clinton, so that wasn't the voters.  In 2020 Trump was the incumbent, similar to Biden over the last year - it is pretty much an automatic win by the party.  In this election we saw Trump's primary vote get cut into by Nikki Haley, but at this point the people that are still Republicans are bought into Trump. Trump essentially ran as an incumbent in 2024 even though he was not, it was the viewpoint of GOP voters.   People were voting for Biden this cycle as they saw him as their best chance to beat Trump to stop Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 and Trump's summarized version: Agenda 47.",karsh36,2024-07-25T10:48:26,2
"I have no clue Clinton, Biden, and Harris are all candidates that were at the bottom half of polls in their primaries and somehow won and became presidential nominees. Democrats desperately need to fix their party win or lose this election because hardly anyone voting for them is voting for them as great presidents they are just voting for them because they are not Trump. The last month has been incredibly frustrating considering people have just now decided Biden is unfit to run the country when I could have told you that a year ago. Had they planned more effectively we could have gotten another redo for DNC candidates but here we are. Now look at conservatives who the majority are satisfied with Trump as their nominee and you have two entirely different batches of people voting. Given the past 8 years of candidates, Democrats have had the option of voting in the primaries. It's safe to say that most of them would mop the floor with Trump and force the Republican Party to do a course correction, instead, we get the opposite. I am more conservative but the ladder situation is preferable to me as I would prefer to have more universally electable candidates in the republican party. Instead, we are seeing the Republican party getting even stronger than it has been in 3 elections in the MAGA sector and the Democrats are all turning on one another. It's also frustrating as all Dems have to do to pretty much win every election is make an effort to appeal to blue-collar and working-class voters and Obama is the last Democrat that made any effort to albeit a small one.",SomethingInTheWater7,2024-07-24T03:12:41,0
"He's wrong, and I don't see why an explanation is really needed to ignore conspiracy theories.  It makes more sense to put the burden of proof on him to justify the conspiracy theory.  First off, Harris being the VP means she'd have a decent shot winning the nomination regardless if Biden didn' trun.  Second, the debate over biden hurt the party, took focus off Trump, and caused some bad blood which may yet hurt the dems, much like the bernie issues in 2016.    It's jsut them making up garbage to try to fit the situation and pretend their opponents are bad people.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-24T18:50:49,2
"He is incorrect I am Republican but this situation just highlights how much Democrats have failed to face reality and plan. Dems spent the last election setting Biden up as a 1 term in-between president and then he decided to run again and they spent the last 2 years gaslighting anyone who talked bad on Biden's health. This has resulted in the current situation of Kamala Harris being set up as the nominee. The majority of Republicans I know(I am in one of the most red states) think this is just an example of Democrat's failures to lead their party. Had they taken action against Biden's cognitive health a year ago they would most likely of had someone stronger than Harris and Biden as their nominee which would have been RFK Jr as he was still in the party at that time. Harris is probably the strongest option right now but remember her public speaking skills were so awful in the first 2 years of Biden's presidency that he would lose points in polls the day after an appearance from her and they pretty much benched her indefinitely. The more she speaks historically in her elections the worse things get for her among most non-coast residing Democrat voters. All of the women I know in my life including my girlfriend are now voting for Trump now simply because Harris is so unbearable to listen to in their opinion and in their eyes as feminists makes women look worse. This situation also weakens Democrats more than people let on considering how while what your friend highlighted is untrue when he claims ""this is a setup."" This does highlight a major hole in one of their biggest talking points so far being, ""Trump is the most anti-democratic president ever."" As they have now presented the worst candidate in the polls of 2020 who would never win a primary side by side with any other Democrat in this country and she was chosen by the party and not by the people. From a certain counter view, this would make the Democrat party look more undemocratic. As a person nobody liked to begin with has now risen to potentially sit in the most powerful position of power in the entire world. I remember Democrat friends despising her in her district attorney days and ever since from then on. Overall this situation is a hot mess no matter how you swing it.",SomethingInTheWater7,2024-07-24T22:08:56,0
"Biden, in March 2020, pledged to pick a woman as his VP.

"Not exactly. Although they are very powerful Pelosi and Schumer are only in charge of their respective caucuses -- the members of the party who have been elected to the two chambers of the federal legislature.  The current chair of the party as an entire organization is Jaime Harrison, since 2021. Each state also has its own party chair and apparatus, so the structure is rather decentralized. These positions are not usually held by the same person for more than four years.  Honestly, the person who is typically seen as the face of the party is the current presidential nominee. Beyond that, it is hard to say that any one is ""in charge of"" the party in the same way that no one is really ""in charge of"" the entire US government.",Doctor_Worm,2024-07-21T23:53:36,3
"To expand on Dr. Worm's point a bit: Despite the fact that people tend to talk about them like they're a monolith, parties are really decentralized in the US. The ""Democratic Party"" isn't just one thing, so it can't have one person who's in charge.    - The DNC is in charge of organizing presidential primary campaigns, and establishing a nationwide brand for the party.   - The DCCC is the national organization that tries to get House Democrats elected.   - the DSCC is the national organization that tries to get Senate Democrats elected.   - The House and Senate Democratic Caucuses each have their own elected leadership (Schumer leads the Senate Caucus, Jeffries leads the House since Pelosi stepped down).   - If the president is a Democrat, there's of course the White House.   - Each of the 50 states has its own Democratic Party. These don't answer directly to the national party, and are responsible for creating the local flavor of the national brand.   Those are just the formal structures. You also have informal powerbrokers like 'party elders' (Obama, the Clintons), prominent activists (Stacey Abrams etc), and to an extent, [megadonors](https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/biggest-donors).",Arthur_Edens,2024-07-22T09:43:54,3
"Not really. American politics is so fractured into different camps that we don't really have single leaders outside of a sitting president. Not really. Pelosi and Schumer carry enormous weight in their own part of the government, and generally speaking within the broader party organization, but they aren't single voices that can speak for everyone.  The Reps kinda do have this with Trump, but that's only because during Trump's first term he intentionally pursued a policy of brain drain within his own party. It applies for Trump only because he damaged his own party to the point that it is completely lacking high quality leaders outside of the ones Trump personally controls.",mormagils,2024-07-22T12:11:59,1
