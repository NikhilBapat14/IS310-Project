"In the US, it is that it is just not possible for working class workers (eg in agriculture, construction and cleaning services) to immigrate legally. There are no legal ways to immigrate. And the only legal way to apply for asylum is to be on US soil, so people cross the border and turn themselves in to authorities to be able to apply, but the GOP keeps reducing the number of asylum judges so nobody can get their case heard.

There are not a lot of Americans trying to sneak into Canada because there isn't a big difference in pay. However if for some reason wages in Canadian were 10x what they are in the US you'd have a ton of people trying to get in illegally.

"I’d be willing bet good money that most immigrants who don’t have papers would prefer to live in the country with proper documentation.  Most people come to the country to make a living, and most of these bureaucratic barriers  we erected to make sure that only the “right people” are coming in just encourage more people to be undocumented. From mandatory wait periods to long applications and restrictions on where you can live and work, it just doesn’t make much financial and logistical sense to go the legal route.  President Trump recently offered a solution that I really like. He said that you can just skip all of that process and buy a green card, or “gold card,” as he called it.

">However, there must root causes which drive people to undertake such dramatic risks to cross heavily guarded borders illegally, and then continue evade capture from authorities while hiding in the country.   I should point out that this is not the only way illegal immigration happens... If you go to Asia, especially South East Asia you will also see white people living and working illegally.   They didn't cross a boarder, but used the power of their foreign passport to get in by plane, and simply never left.   My point is that illegal immigration is a much deeper issue than simply what you see on TV.

The root cause is that the wage for even an under the table illegal worker in a developed nation exceeds a middle class wage in their nation of origin. As such there are four ways i can see of stopping it.    Help develop the nations of origin so there economies and wages improve to the point emigrating isn't such a big inprovement to earnings.      Destroy the economy of the developed country to the point wages fall to match that of the country of origin.      Make all such immigration legal from those countries.      Extreme border controls where every land and port is patrolled 24/7 along witthe complete removal of visas or other means of legal travel to the country of origin.,Prasiatko,2025-03-09T09:44:00,2
"The root cause for the illegal immigration from south of the border to the United States dates back to Ronald Reagans Central American policies and regime changes that he and the CIA orchestrated to make the governments more favorable to the United States.  His policies collapsed Central American governments and caused the drug cartels to flourish which caused other problems for the United States.  In the end the people who lived in these countries saw their way of life disappear and in many places if they didn't work for the drug cartels their life expectancy was only 22 years, so as a matter of survival the United States offered a better way of life and they went for it.",Falcon3492,2025-03-09T12:05:26,2

">So, what are these root causes?  Borders.  It sounds glib but there has been ""illegal immigration"" for as long as humanity has had things that we could call borders.   People move around. It's what we do. We move in response to weather, changes in life circumstances, economic opportunities, educational opportunities, etc.   North Korea has a virtual shoot on sight policy for their border and yet even they have recognized that you can't really stop people from hopping the border and there are actually benefits to letting people get away with it. There's a relatively free flow of goods and information over the North Korean-Chinese border and North Korea tolerates this to a degree.  If North Korea has decided to give up on a strict border policy, it's pretty much pointless to pursue it.",HeloRising,2025-03-08T21:19:29,4
"Many people come into the US through legal ports of entry and then overstay their work/tourist/education visa. Others are refugees fleeing conflict from all over the world. I met an immigrant who came here from Ecuador with her children after her husband was kidnapped by gangs. Others seek a better life/jobs/opportunities. I think a big reason why people are ""illegal"" goes back to the 1996 law the IIRAIRA. I wrote about this in a post on the ezra klein subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1j28bs0/a\_case\_study\_in\_bureaucratic\_stupidity/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ezraklein/comments/1j28bs0/a_case_study_in_bureaucratic_stupidity/) . In essence the reason that people are ""illegal"" is we passed laws making it impossible for people, many of whom have been in the US for decades, to ever become ""legal"" by changing the law in three ways:  1. Prior to the passage of the IIRAIRA, the Attorney General could “exercise discretion to grant suspension of deportation to an individual who established seven years continuous physical presence in the U.S., good moral character during that period, and that deportation would result in extreme hardship to the individual or to his or her spouse, parent, or child who was a US citizen or lawful permanent resident.” However, the IIRAIRA limited the number of undocumented immigrants who could be granted “cancellation of removal” to 4,000 a year. While one can imagine that it was a form of ritual humiliation to prove to some government functionary your good moral character and the hardship that would be caused by your deportation, limiting discretion of government agents to make an exception of your case made the situation infinitely worse. 2. Immigrants who overstayed their visa were barred from entering the US for a set period of time (3 years if they overstayed between 180 and 365 days and 10 year if they overstayed for more than a year). This made it so that people couldn’t return to their countries of origin to apply for legal status without a major disruption to their lives. 3. Finally, undocumented immigrants in the US could no longer apply for legal status.  This basically trapped people in the US because it was better to stay then to go home and risk not being able to come back to the US for 10 years.",matt-the-dickhead,2025-03-09T00:45:25,2

"This question can be entered in one of two contexts: The *literal* reason, as in ""why does anyone want to immigrant in the first place?"" With the answer obviously being income inequality and a want for economic and social mobility. And then there's the **logistics** reason, as in ""why are people choosing to enter illegally rather than legally?"" Which has gone drastically unaddressed by the popular public.  The latter question is something that can more easily be addressed. The backlog of migrant cases is in the thousands, with judges understaffed to take them. Many of these migrants are legitimate refugees that aren't being addressed through our system, and even the non-refugees are a net benefit to the country since they follow laws, pay income taxes, and contribute to our economy in nearly every metric. There's also no economic benefit in NOT legalizing them, when we have plenty of financial incentive to do so.  The problem is that our citizens ignorantly assume that our legal processes are perfectly fine, without realizing that if you're not Cuban/Indian, the wait lines take decades since we have country caps on the number of legal applicants we accept. People who cross the border and people applying can wait up to a decade for legal residency. THAT is the main reason immigrants are illegal, its not a lack of effort on their own parts, just a consequence to an overburdened understaffed bureaucracy.  The message democrats need to emphasize is ""Fix LEGAL immigration"" to fight illegal immigration. This is the most unnecessary humanitarian issue that could exist. But when its framed as solely an ethical dilemma rather than a practical solution, the argument and focus shifts towards allowing the continuation of illegal immigration, rather than highlighting a reasonable pathway to legal residency and citizenship.",illegalmorality,2025-03-09T11:42:18,1
"Yeah it’s called capitalism and American Imperialism  Corporations want cheap resources and access to the globe, the American Government wants money and land, so they help eachother - look up how we got the saying “a Banana Republic”. We are routinely doing coups on governments that try to nationalize their own resources out of America’s control - we can look to chile, Iran, Guatemala or any other country we’ve had a hand in destabilizing.   Bombing families, destroying their governments, and driving climate change has largely contributed to people having to flee their homes. And you’re a lot less likely to get bombed if you live in the country doing the bombing (you might still get bombed tho, we’ve bombed our own citizens before)  The sad reality is that capitalism NEEDS immigrants or else it wouldn’t be able to sustain itself.   The cost of living in capitalism is always kept at a level so that workers feel like things are scarce and so they feel desperate for ANY work they can find. Why? So capitalists can pay you the least amount possible for your labor while asking you to work more. Because if we don’t work in capitalism, we get made homeless, and we DIE. It’s work, or you die. That’s the coercion of labor, you work or you die. Capitalists are aware of this and use it to continually exploit workers  This economic environment leaves workers feeling like they’re too poor to have children, so they don’t. They work and try to save what little money they can. Those few workers that CAN afford to have kids are in such small amount that it can’t replace the workforce that society requires to function. So we have a constantly shrinking population that’s continuously consolidating wealth to the top, leaving very little for everyone at the bottom to share amongst themselves.   So since people aren’t afforded enough to live, they don’t have kids - society and capitalists have seen this problem and decided the solution is immigrants. Make more of them and demonize them to maintain economic control and the status quo  Capitalists rely on immigrants to act as a scapegoat for peoples economic problems, while also using them to drive down the wages of workers. This also allows capitalists to exert more control over and exploit these workers more than an average worker, because of the threat of deportation.   Wanna stop immigrants coming to your country? Stop bombing countries and doing coups on their governments. Have worker unions take control of industries and allow democracy into the workplace, get good pay and working conditions for everyone regardless of citizenship.

"Normally when you analyse migration you analyse push and pull factors, so factors that are negative in your country and factors that you desire in other countrys. Speaking of ""illegal migration"" is in my opinion always a bad thing, you should only speak of migration, because people tend to stygmatise other people who are called illegal. It is also a relevant fact that most of migration in total is migration in the own country. This are long story short root causes  So I suppose that you want to adress the migration to another country. I would claim that in this case you have both, push and pull. For example in south america the people want to get away from the disparities that cause social tension. The ""criminal drug dealing gangs"" are a problem for those people as well. Because the people know that it could be possible to migrate to the US they might try that, also because ths US stands for prosperity in their minds.  Now lets imagine there would be a better social and political situation in those south american countrys (most of them actually are not mexico). Would people still migrate? Not that much for sure, there would still be regular migration (to study in the US, to work in the US, tourism). Many of those people might not stay and most importantly: They all have a social status. They have an income or the parents have to be wealthy. But this is not the part you would call ""illegal immigrants"", would you? Certainly not, because there are visa for these possible causes of ""migration"".  You probably mean people without a social status who hope for a better life in America, who dont have (at least a perspective for) a social status. Those people are most of the times poor, they have nothing. When they come to the US the social problems of the US start to get relevant: People without a job have to work anywhere without a proper ""apprenticeship"" and have to live in a segregated part of the city, because their income is not really high, because they are working informal. There might also be the problem of language barrier, but I suppose that you can get along with spanish pretty well in the border states, espacially in the segregated parts of certain citys.  But you ask for my opinion: Because it is nearly impossible to limit push factors with a capitalist midset (the thing you actually asked for; Well I would guess that you have to imprison any poor person or do actual socialist policys) and because it is not really a positive pull factor that segregation in the US is better than living in another city in south America I would try to improve the situation in the US, so that the segregation does not lead to bigger problems and that people may work regulary in good jobs. In my opinion local somehow unions with integrated migrants, political interested people and new migrants should form to provide aid to one another, because the US government does not do it, and to be realistic, wont do it, even though governmental funding for these unions would probably be a good thing. I suppose that a stop of stygmatisation and a more liberal migration law could also help, something like a ""provisionally citicenship"" that grants the same rights and stability for everyone who would like to stay in the US for their life.",Lauchiger-lachs,2025-03-09T03:07:41,0

"We literally installed multiple brutal dictators in South America.  In Argentina, military forces overthrew the democratically elected President Isabel Perón in the 1976 Argentine coup d'état, starting the military dictatorship of General Jorge Rafael Videla. The coup was accepted and tacitly supported by the Ford administration and the U.S. government had close relations with the ensuing authoritarian regime, with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger paying several official visits to Argentina.  The US government supported the 1971 coup led by General Hugo Banzer that toppled President Juan José Torres of Bolivia. Torres had displeased Washington by convening an ""Asamblea del Pueblo"" (Assembly of the Town), in which representatives of specific proletarian sectors of society were represented (miners, unionized teachers, students, peasants), and more generally by leading the country in what was perceived as a left wing direction. Banzer hatched a bloody military uprising starting on August 18, 1971, that succeeded in taking the reins of power by August 22, 1971.  Brazil experienced several decades of authoritarian governments, especially after the US-backed 1964 Brazilian coup d'état against social democrat João Goulart. Under then-President John F. Kennedy, the US sought to ""prevent Brazil from becoming another China or Cuba"", a policy which was carried forward under Lyndon B. Johnson and which led to US military support for the coup in April 1964.  After the democratic election of President Salvador Allende in 1970, an economic war ordered by President Richard Nixon, among other things, caused the 1973 Chilean coup d'état with the involvement of the CIA due to Allende's democratic socialist leanings. What followed was the decades-long US-backed military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.  This is just a few examples. Cuba, Venezula, Haiti, Panama. The list goes on. We literally had a school, The School of The Americas in Panama, where we trained South American military personnel to do this.

If, as I believe you are suggesting,  I wanted to increase jobs in the United States, I suppose I would do what old orange is doing - reducing job competition by reducing the number of workers by getting rid of illegal workers. I doubt that most Americans will take those jobs - at least not at the current wages and working conditions.   Access to food in their native country?

"IMO, a primary cause for immigration is opportunity, typically financial, but safety & well being, parents wanting a better life for their kids away from whatever other crappy situations exist in their home country: politically, economically, socially etc. Unfortunately, assimilating into the US is not a primary objective or priority (I know that’s a broad generalization).  I see this EVERY day, since I teach ELL high schoolers, math & science.  Candidly, I periodically poll students about how much English they practiced at home (or work) over the weekend, over breaks and over summer vacations.  Do this with their parents, siblings, their pet dog, whatever.  In the majority of cases, the answer is none, or extremely little.  It is very possible to live, shop, work within & among their ethnic communities for weeks or months at a time without the need for spoken English except in only the fewest of instances.  I’m stubborn enough to continue pressing that point, and it ain’t easy! But,  Regardless, money alone is not the answer.  Hundreds of billions, nay, tipping into trillions of dollars have been spent by the federal government just in the last 50-60 years on programs to reduce poverty, provide social welfare ‘safety- nets’, housing, food security, including dipping (w/ a massive back-hoe!) into social security to fund new classifications of aid, etc., etc., etc.  The ROI has not reaped the benefits intended. So to all the absolute irrational insanity on display by the left, I say, “what have we got to lose, by trying a different path?” And by their non-stop bitching, who’s trying to maintain the status quo, now?",WATGGU,2025-03-11T14:53:22,2

"So everyone that’s homeless is because “THEY” chose to be? That is a weak argument. I and Elon never said it was his responsibility. Did we? Last but not least. If I gave you $100,000 everyday from the year 1 A.D. until today, you would not have as much money as Elon Musk is worth.

"This is an extremely bad faith argument and ignores that many that are homeless are not drug addicts or mentally ill. However, the claim that drug addicts and mentally ill individuals will inevitably trash a home and require another one oversimplifies complex issues and ignores evidence-based solutions. Studies show that supportive housing, when combined with mental health care and addiction treatment, helps individuals maintain stability and reduces homelessness. The Housing First model, for example, has proven effective in improving long-term outcomes. While some may struggle without proper support, assuming all individuals in these groups will destroy property is a harmful stereotype. Providing housing with necessary services is not only more compassionate but also more cost-effective than cycling people through jails, shelters, and emergency rooms.",Shionkron,2025-03-14T07:57:19,0
"I'm from Switzerland, and here, the left had a brilliant idea to introduce a policy (2020 Corporate Responsibility Initiative) that Swiss businesses could only trade or do business with foreign companies that met the same standards as Switzerland in terms of environmental protection and worker/human rights. Unfortunately, the right-wing and centrist parties here killed the bill. I believe something like this could be extremely beneficial for developing countries, ensuring that their workers aren’t exploited and their natural resources are better protected from predatory corporations.  Edit: If a major economy like the U.S. were to implement something like this, it could have a significant impact on those countries. While it would likely make cheap products from low-income countries more expensive, it could probably lead to a reduction in immigration by addressing some of the root causes of economic disparity.",Proper-Republic1561,2025-03-09T13:56:03,4

Cicero also has used PragerU content which lied about statistics to back its claims on the number of homeless being drug addicts.

"I mean, obviously you're being facetious, but I was asking what the correct policy would actually be, not if one politician or another would actually do it. Ironically, Kamala Harris was in charge with exploring this question herself as VP, and didn't seem to do much in the way publicly recommending any of the policy identified here either.  However, I would maintain that this is in fact also the best way for a billionaire to become more wealthy in the end. Usually they only have short term thinking for some reason, although they act like they're galaxy brains playing 4D chess, they always seem to have the same short-sighted solutions which rob the lower classes, and economic stability over the course, in favour of immediately lining their pockets.   Instead, I believe making your neighbours prosperous so they can contribute as partners to the system will always ultimately enrich you more over the long term. Empowering the lower classes with high quality jobs that have living wages, and a safety net that allows them to seek education and entrepreneurship just creates more investment opportunities for you, the billionaire they will be asking for investment. That opportunity only compounds with each of your neighbouring nations doing the same, as the billionaire class observes no borders.",Storymode-Chronicles,2025-03-09T17:49:02,1

"> What group is not integrated after three generations?  There are no groups -- there is only illusion/hallucination about groups. There are no separate teams, but there are adults who want to teach their children that they're on separate teams (and that some teams are nicer/better than other teams).  > Pretty sure your example of prisons is not very applicable to the larger society.  Why wouldn't it be? The model of separate, distinct races doesn't come from adults in prisons. Prison conditions simply *reveal* the underlying tribalism.  We could point to schools just as easily, where some adults desperately want kids taught that ""blackness"" and ""brownness"" are real things, and that some kids have the right to punch other kids for singing along to the wrong team's songs.  > People from Alabama have never been on the same team as people from Boston.  *To you*, maybe -- but if you asked them, what would they say?  > Native Americans and New Mexicans...
