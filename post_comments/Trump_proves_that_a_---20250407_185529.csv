Word salad? More like a dementia induced oral bowel movement. Only question is will president Vance be better or worse?,AllTheGoodNamesDied,2025-04-07T19:03:16,1
"so, his words salads are acceptable - but kamala’s weren’t?",1980sNeon,2025-04-07T18:57:44,1
"Trumple also proved that you need no qualifications to become and stay president of the US. You can behave like a fucking lunatic, make no sense at all, declare you don't care about the consequences, and still get the support of the majority of the government. Almost like none of them are qualified either. Shame. Shame. Shame.",bytemage,2025-04-07T19:11:19,1
He is a lunatic. His rambling is a what crazy people do when they are off medication.,niley78,2025-04-07T19:15:33,1
"> I said we're gonna try and get groceries down right? An old-fashioned term, but a beautiful term.   Why does he continually insist that the word ""groceries"" is an old-fashioned term?",panteleimon_the_odd,2025-04-07T19:46:37,1
The focus of this should be on the critical thinking skills of the Wall St folks who acted in this.,LookForDucks,2025-04-07T20:43:35,1
It really didn’t move that crazily today.  Unfortunately I think the level Trump can really manipulate the market is limited in that he can make it go down a lot more but he’ll never see $613 SPY again.,FawningDeer37,2025-04-07T19:00:55,1
Literally had a Trump supporter tell me that Kamala can't speak. The way they described her was as if they swapped the names out.,Brilliant-Slice-2049,2025-04-07T19:03:42,1
"Ya, modern is ""things"" or ""food thingies"", if you'd like to be more specific",roninXpl,2025-04-07T20:41:40,1
"kamala is educated and experienced. i think she used “big” words that maga didn’t know the definitions of, and thus, this frustrated them.",1980sNeon,2025-04-07T19:05:50,1
She has always been unpopular on a national level and a little off putting with her cackling and her rambling speeches. Shame the DNC didn't hold a primary to replace Biden because she would not have won lol,AllTheGoodNamesDied,2025-04-07T19:07:58,1
"“rambling speeches” Ah yes, the famous Harris speech about being in water with an electric car vs a shark. Oh wait…",SuspiciousSlipper,2025-04-07T19:34:42,1
Oh Trump is 10 times worse at this point. No argument there!,AllTheGoodNamesDied,2025-04-07T19:40:18,1
