"""BLM"" = Bureau of Land Management, to be clear.  From the article:   ""Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management state director has been placed on administrative leave after a federal investigation found he violated ethics regulations.   Andrew Archuleta accepted a gift of dinner and drinks, misused his assistant’s time when he asked her to make travel arrangements for his girlfriend and drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle — all in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, according to a February investigation summary from the Office of Inspector General.""",PansophicNostradamus,2025-04-30T18:20:01,7
Actually on leave for ethics violations?  Must be a Democrat appointment.,reverendcat,2025-04-30T18:19:19,6
Is the ethic violation “having ethics?”  Because that seems like it would be a problem for this admin.,thedoofimbibes,2025-04-30T22:20:01,1
It makes me think of S1 of white lotus when Gary is talking about working for BLM and Tanya asks how he got into activism and she didn't figure out he meant Bureau of Land Management til the next day.,Pike_Gordon,2025-04-30T18:30:24,4
"Also, lots of people skim articles and may read this and believe it was a Black Lives Matters director, which we all know would rile the irk of right wing media.",PansophicNostradamus,2025-04-30T18:41:35,3
