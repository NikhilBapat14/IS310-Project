"It is more like a corporate oligarchy when it comes to funding and supporting the candidates they prefer. Each side is influenced by separate groups of oligarchs. They have a significant influence on the direction of the country the leadership takes when elected to office.  The president ultimately decides, but not in a vacuum, they are influenced by the oligarchs.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T10:23:26,5

Vox... Are you trying to sane wash this issue? It's no longer open to debate. We are an oligarchy. It's form is still maturing. And from a political point of view... the politics are similar to early 1930's Germany. In those days no one predicted the coming events.,williamgman,2025-04-28T10:28:53,8
"It’s not like there’s a bright line, but … it’s reasonable to say that America is closer to oligarchy than to democracy.    America has never been a direct democracy, and it certainly didn’t start off a a democracy.  But we made a lot of moves in that direction … recognizing the rights of more people to vote for their representation (women, minorities, the poor, etc).   Rich people have always felt like they should be the ones who have more influence over how the country goes.  There’s a ton of people who don’t believe that “all people are created equal.”  That’s the basis of most of our internal conflict since the founding.    Rich people are now allowed to have huge sway over our elections and over our policy.  Rich people can openly bribe politicians and funnel huge torrents of money into getting their preferred candidate elected.  Rich people get immediate meetings with their representatives - poor people don’t.    In court, rich people get away with crimes.  They get away with evading their taxes, which were already set by policy to be at lower percentages than the poor or working classes have to pay.  You’re also vastly more likely to be elected to Congress if you’re wealthy.  In most ways, we are governed by the wealthy, and policy always takes their interests into account more so than the working and poor classes.    These forces are just more obvious now - when you have the three richest men in the world sitting on the dais behind a (supposed) billionaire who got elected President … who ran explicitly on a platform of cutting his own taxes and allowing him to get away with crimes.  I think ‘oligarchy’ is a fair and defensible label.  ",mysticrhythms,2025-04-28T10:23:23,9

"Read the [Powell Memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_F._Powell_Jr.#Powell_Memorandum,_1971).   Republicans have spent 50 years trying to disenfranchise average Americans, in order to let corporations walk all over us.  It's the whole point of the GOP.  To remove consumer protections, to harass experts who point out dangerous products, or polluting byproducts.   And because we failed to elect Al Gore, they won.  They achieved their ultimate victory with _Citizens United_.  Because we failed to elect Hillary, we lost our last chance to overturn _Citizens United_.  Just remember, when you hear people calling Dems 'milquetoast,' those are the clowns who got us into this mess.  All we needed was to vote Blue.  We'd have an 8-1 liberal Supreme Court right now.
