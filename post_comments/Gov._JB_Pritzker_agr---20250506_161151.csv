"Just another reminder that Sanctuary Cities were a GOP creation because immigrant communities wouldn't talk to the police when violent crimes happened for fear of being deported. Police agreed not to turn people over to INS so they would give statements so the police could solve violent crimes.

"Which is perfectly reasonable. A few years ago I called 911 because I was concerned for a neighbor after hearing particularly loud screaming and thuds from inside their apartment. Turns out the guy had hit his gf hard enough to knock her out and crack her skull.  Now, I'm a natural-born citizen. But what if I were undocumented and just trying to get through life with my head down because my family is relying on my paycheck to survive, or I was afraid of getting murdered in my country? I might second-guess myself and the woman could be dead. What if I, god forbid, end up in the same situation as my neighbor someday and *my* neighbor didn't call the cops because THEY were scared?  Local law enforcement should never be involved in matters of immigration in any way. Only local public safety.

Rural counties that had unbearably bad roads, including highways, not 10 years ago have all been able to repave and repair their roads. Could be a different story south of around Mt.
