I don't see why being a real housewives star necessarily disqualifies her.  I feel like Trump appointing her probably means she's either a Holocaust denier or supports the displacement and genocide of any group other than Jews.,Dogdiscsanddyes,2025-05-09T17:12:52,30

The article doesn't mention what her background is. While I doubt she's qualified cuz Trump appointed her it does make for rather shitty clickbait and not journalism.,Complete_Question_41,2025-05-10T12:11:50,1
