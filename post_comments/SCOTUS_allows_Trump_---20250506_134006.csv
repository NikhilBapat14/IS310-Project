"Just to clarify, this isn‚Äôt the end of the legal fight. SCOTUS specifically is allowing the ban to go into effect while court proceedings are ongoing. The ban had been frozen during proceedings by a lower court previously.   Still not good by any means, but not the end yet.",Joopac_Badur,2025-05-06T15:32:53,9
"What a fucking waste of everyone's time.  Transgender people represent 0.6% of the military.  The administration knows despite the trivial number of trans people, uneducated MAGA people will love it",metskyfan,2025-05-06T15:55:46,8
It‚Äôll be reversed in 2028 when a democrat president has to sweep up the republican rubble again. Just like Biden did in 2021 to trump‚Äôs old ban.,Acuallyizadern93,2025-05-06T14:36:29,14

"Let‚Äôs be honest this was never about military readiness or cost. It‚Äôs just cruelty, plain and simple.   The Army spends about $58,000 to recruit and train a single soldier through their first six months. That doesn‚Äôt even include the long-term investment in ongoing training, experience, and benefits. Kicking out trained transgender troops means wasting all of that and then spending even more to replace them.   The idea that banning capable, committed people somehow makes the military stronger is ridiculous. This is pure discrimination, and it actually weakens the force.",Lucky-Pause-2176,2025-05-10T12:49:16,1
Good job SCOTUS in allowing our military and the U.S. look weaker in one decision. No other western developed country bans transgender troops. This makes us look stupid and weak! Congrats transphobes and MAGA your hate and stupidity wins!  SMH....,Christymapper71,2025-05-06T15:43:40,1

"Republicans appointed 16 of the last 21 Supreme Court Justices in the past 55 years.  Impeached presidents  Nixon + Trump appointed 7, Democrats appointed 5.  The fact that two of the most corrupt presidents in US history have appointed more SCJs in the last half century than all Democrats combined is terrifying.",charlito3210,2025-05-06T14:02:31,51

Regardless of the amount of troops affected it makes our military and us look weak to the world. All in name of bigotry. NOT GOOD.,Christymapper71,2025-05-06T16:03:15,1
"Yes. Other numbers show 0.4%. The Democratic Party should not be expending political capital on this tiny minority. Overemphasis on this benefits Trump. Remember ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you"". It worked for Trump.",Animats,2025-05-06T16:28:25,0

"They have done EXACTLY what they intended in their presidential immunity case: made SCOTUS the final arbiter of what is and isn't unconstitutional, instead of allowing lower courts to do their jobs.

"That's not true, either. The Garcia case is the perfect example. The lower court ruled that Garcia should be returned for due process. The SCOTUS agreed, but sent it *back* to the lower court for further clarification. That's how it's always worked.",VintageLV,2025-05-06T16:24:28,0
