"It sure seems to me that what happened here was this...  Newsom and his team decided that the reason trump won was 'new media' and someone came up with the idea that Newsom should do his own podcast! It will be a hit!  Then, to try and make inroads to what they think Gen Z wants, he brought on several right wing speakers and found something to agree with them on, thereby burnishing his 'I'm not one of THOSE Democrats' creds.   Then... they were surprised to find that most people in the party found it highly not cool to platform the people he has platformed. Now in a bit of a scramble they decided o apparently try to position Newsom even more 'outside' the party in an attempt to draw in young men which apparently they have decided is the key metric. And obviously they think that if he does get the nomination, enough Democrats will come home and not care about all this just because they want a win.  This is all a highly tactical kind of strategy... and it's utterly stupid. Newsom is once again making the mistake that   if you bend to the right, they will somehow like you and vote for you. When they will be happy for you to give them a voice and then shiv you for a grin later. At the same time he's miscounting the growing anger on the Democratic side.   It's the kind of strategy only a professional consultant could love... the ones that THINK they know better than anyone else.",WebRepulsive8329,2025-04-23T12:14:22,15

"In his recent podcast appearances, he really went out of his way to abandon progressive ideals and laughingly agree with far right demons on how ‘crazy the left has gotten.’ I’d normally call him a right wing shitbag for it, but truth be told I don’t think he actually believes in anything. There doesn’t seem to be a core of ideals underneath the slimy surface, just raw political ambition. He should not be allowed to represent the Democrats.",Devilnaht,2025-04-23T12:07:54,3

"Excerpt:  *In an exclusive interview with NBC News, the California governor said Democrats need to rebuild from ""the bottom up"" and stop looking for a savior on a ""white horse.""*  *Gov. Gavin Newsom, widely viewed as a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, had tough words for his own party — ""We are as dumb as we want to be,"" he said — in an exclusive interview Monday with NBC News in this Marin County suburb north of San Francisco.*  *Democrats have been too focused on the personality of candidates at the top of the ticket, rather than building a platform that is bigger than the nominee and addresses how the party will fight for what voters want, he said.*  *""We just have to move beyond the guy or gal on the white horse that's going to come save the day — it's exhausting,"" the second-term chief executive of the nation's most-populous state said. ""This party needs to rebuild itself from the bottom up, not top down. We are as dumb as we want to be.""*  *In his nascent quest to help revitalize the Democratic Party, Newsom has been criticized by some progressives for hosting a pair of high-profile allies of President Donald Trump — Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk — on his new podcast, ""This is Gavin Newsom.""*  *(The writer of this article sat for an interview on the podcast this week.)*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-23T12:04:17,-1
What do Dems think of Newsom? He's clearly trying to re-mold himself as a moderate candidate (who will run as a Democrat) for the 2028 race. I think he's probably the front runner right now.,Curze98,2025-04-23T12:51:00,-2
