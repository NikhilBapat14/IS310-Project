"""The effort by the right wing worked,"" Psaki says.  Lol. She's insinuating that the media reporting on Biden's decline actually made it happen. And of course she didn't see it just like Jean-Pierre didn't. She's exactly where she needs to be now, at MSDNC smack in the middle of the liar's slot.",social_dinosaur,2025-05-03T07:07:03,67
"She was paid to lie for the Biden administration to the public. Now she found a a professional goldmine. ‚ÄúLook right into the camera, dear and just say whatever we give you. Try to provoke and don‚Äôt worry about truth so much.‚Äú",Flare4roach,2025-05-03T08:01:53,67

I just don‚Äôt see the incentive to lie these days for her. She was paid for it before but it wasn‚Äôt fooling many and it‚Äôs not fooling any right now (hopefully).,skarface6,2025-05-03T09:01:03,5

Standard playbook for Democrats and the propaganda machine. Never admit to lying. Never admit to being wrong. Repeat the same talking points over and over and eventually people will believe it.,RandolphE6,2025-05-03T13:22:23,1

The Trump admin should start every press conference by putting people on record,AppState1981,2025-05-03T14:54:16,3
"It would affect her credibility as a pundit now. Sure, we all know she's lying but as long as she never admits it, the handful of rubes that like her will continue to believe her.   I think they also need to keep the lie going because it confirms their worldview that Everything Under Biden=Good and Everything Under Trump=Bad. Admitting Biden was out for ice cream for his entire presidency might make some people open their eyes.",dom650,2025-05-03T10:36:26,7
