"I have a great idea!  How about the world agrees the USA doesn't get to host anymore prestigious international events until they get these evil, Nazi fucks out of their government?!",Zazen_Satori_Gaming,2025-05-06T18:01:16,41

"Most of the world does not believe that being around us in the US is some great privilege that is worth risking wrongful imprisonment, anti-immigrant sentiment, unprecedented violence for a country of our status, and having to look at the hideous vestiges of our president and vice president saying things that normal people haven’t believed since the time of the Coolidge administration. Maybe families fleeing violence or lack of opportunity in their home country, but not people with the affluence to be able to afford international travel for a sporting event.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-06T17:23:49,20

"BUT… if you’ve said something bad about our leader on your phone and we see it on a random search - everything you’ve payed for and booked will be in jeopardy.  Have tattoos? Crowns? Stars? (extremely common male tattoos btw) - again, everything you’ve payed for and booked will be in jeopardy.

I swear it it is like on every issue they ask themselves “what is the right thing to do?” Then they do or say the exact opposite on every single issue and topic. It is so cartoonishly over the top ever damn time.,OldschoolScience,2025-05-06T21:43:19,2

"Fr, blacklist us, reschedule to a not fascist location. I get the WC is a big deal for fans globally but a lot of folks here in the US still need to learn and keeping a massive influx of tourism money out of their hands will help some wake tf up.
