Stephen Miller is a fascist to the core. If only he would have gotten laid more in college this country wouldn’t be nose diving into autocracy as it is currently…,dude1984-,2025-05-05T07:40:05,17

This is a non-story. National Security Advisor is a non-confirmed position that *anybody* could serve in. Its remit encompasses whatever the President decides it does. Miller already has Trump’s ear on any and every subject he wants to have input on. His influence and authority will not increase because of a “Title.”,No_Comment_8598,2025-05-05T09:10:48,1

"Even Trump’s Undocumented Employees Pay More Taxes than He Does  https://preview.redd.it/ppcbw2csxzye1.jpeg?width=1118&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f11f72011c55121b39fbfccf74d2c7615ad103e5  His company is again seeking seasonal foreign workers for one of the luxury resorts he still profits from as president. The request from Trump’s business comes days after his administration released a raft of new seasonal work visas, fulfilling a request from a group that held a fundraiser at another Trump resort less than two weeks earlier.  The timeline demonstrates how Trump’s company benefits from special interest spending aimed at influencing his administration, while it also takes advantage of his administration’s policies.

"I saw a TikTok of someone who said they went to school with him and that he was always like this, but has gotten worse now. That he always liked to stir crap with other students by saying off the wall racist stuff or just off the wall stuff in general to purposefully upset people. He ran for student body president and apparently his speech was hateful and ridiculous and he ended up losing and was mad. He’s just a hateful mean person. He enjoys being evil.",Low_Pea4800,2025-05-05T11:21:22,6

"I want to say it was the Daily Show, or Last Week Tonight, or some podcast did a report about him, even had audio from his run for class president where he was degrading the janitorial staff, he was a HUGE Rush Limbaugh fan and would regularly call in. He grew up in Southern California and despises Mexicans/hispanic people (which is apparent). One would have to believe that much of this immigrant hate policy coming from this Trump circus is being penned by Miller, the fascist enthusiast.",dude1984-,2025-05-05T12:36:59,5
