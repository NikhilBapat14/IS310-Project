> But lawyers for the government argued in Martin’s case that courts shouldn’t be “second-guessing” law enforcement decisions.  That exactly what they should be doing every single day.,IUsedToBeACave,2025-04-27T12:42:03,150

">The agent leading the raid returned later to apologize and leave a business card with a supervisor’s name. But the family received no compensation from the government, not even for the damage to the house, Cliatt said.  Outside of the PTSD the victims now seem to have (symptoms described in article), the government should surely replace and repair any physical damage they caused to their property.  That the government didn't leaves the victims with no other recourse but to sue.  Thank goodness they were able to retain counsel.  Lots of poor folks wouldn't be so lucky.",chockedup,2025-04-27T16:41:59,8
"“Personal GPS” should be a fireable offense. What the fuck are you doing with personal GPS for a raid? Raiding the wrong house should get everyone fired. Raiding the wrong house is also called breaking and entering. Pointing guns at people without cause is assault by pointing. Forget a lawsuit, these FBI agents should be in jail.",propervinegarsauce,2025-04-27T18:50:37,8
"I haven't heard of this story before. What happened to this family was extremely unfair.   >A federal judge in Atlanta dismissed the suit in 2022 and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision last year. The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up the matter.  I don't understand why the suit was dismissed and the appeals court upheld that decision!! This was an innocent family that suffered at the hands of law enforcement. They deserve compensation. Not sure why it matters that this was a mistake. Just because something was done by mistake doesn't mean the person isn't responsible.  It's just like the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case. If you make a mistake, you're supposed to do what you can to make it right. I know some people debate whether or not his deportation really was a mistake, but still, that's what the trump admin admitted to, and they should do what they can do correct their mistake.  This idea that someone can make a mistake and then do *absolutely nothing* to try to correct the situation is bizarre.",sachiprecious,2025-04-27T13:28:23,10

"checks and balances have been thrown completely overboard. the supreme court wrung their hands with the 9-0 ruling on abrego-garcia’s return saying that the executive branch was obligated to fix their mistake, but also tried to say the courts should “show deference to the executive branch on matters of foreign policy,” which 1) completely upends the idea of rule of law and 2) buries the lede unfathomably deep when it comes to what’s considered “foreign policy.” how the hell does detaining someone on american soil count as foreign policy? if i murdered someone in my hometown, flew out to japan, and had officers knocking on my door later to arrest and extradite me back to the states, could i defend myself in court by saying that me being overseas counts as “foreign policy” and therefore under the jurisdiction of the executive branch?",LITTLE-GUNTER,2025-04-27T13:08:16,12

"WOW.   So who do we turn to because since I was a child cops have becoming increasingly militarized, aggressive and accusatory. Cops are people too and sometimes some of the worst- since we don’t fire bad cops, we transfer them.   So, government lawyers, please share who, exactly, are we supposed to turn to when these cops abuse power???",SammieStones,2025-04-28T05:41:37,2

"This particular slide actually started months earlier in the immigration system. The Supreme Court determined that there is no right to appeal a government decision made by immigration officials.  A US citizen woman was petitioning for her spouse to receive a green card but it was denied because USCIS believed his tattoos to be gang-related (are we sensing a theme here with US immigration and tattoos?). The couple had very compelling evidence that the tattoos were not gang-related, but the Supreme Court determined that there is no right to judicial review of government decisions.  Most Americans hand wave this away as ""why should immigrants expect to have rights"" but ignore the fact that it's not the immigrant's rights being violated, it is the US sponsor's. Vast majority of immigration visas can't be requested by the beneficiary, it must be done by a US sponsor (like a spouse, relative, employer) who petitions the government on the immigrant's behalf.  And the upshot is that there's no recourse for a decision the government makes either in error or punitively.
