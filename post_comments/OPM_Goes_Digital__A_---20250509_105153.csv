"> Some historical perspective shows just how astounding the pace at which this has been achieved is. In the early 2000s, for instance, OPM tried and failed to get a retirement processing modernization program developed known as the RetireEZ project.  ...  > In late 2001, retaining the name RSM, the agency embarked upon its third initiative to modernize the retirement process and examined the possibility of privately sourced technologies and tools.   ...  > However, by May 2008 the agency determined that the system was not working as expected and suspended system operation. In October 2008, after 5 months of attempting to address quality issues, the agency terminated the contract for the system. In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program and reported that its efforts to modernize retirement processing would continue. However, after several years of trying to revitalize the program, the agency terminated the retirement system modernization in February 2011.  ...  > Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia joined the DOGE team and took the lead on modernizing OPM’s retirement processing system. He told Fox News, “This will be an online digital process that will take just a few days at most… it’s an injustice to civil servants who are subjected to these processes.”  ...  > Now, just five days later, OPM has begun rolling the system out to the federal government as a whole. So, in the span of a few months, DOGE and OPM’s Retirement Services team have apparently achieved what the agency failed to do over a span of about a decade with the RetireEZ program.
