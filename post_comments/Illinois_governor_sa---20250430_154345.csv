Pritzker 2028 if we make it out of this mess.,Routine-Reaction-592,2025-04-30T15:56:48,862
"God this is so refreshing. I’m sick of the idea that democrats lost because the only focused on LGBT issues. Which is completely false, the media solely focused on those issues while ignoring any democratic economic policy",Cyndakill88,2025-04-30T16:11:25,993
"I hope he’s seriously considering a presidential run in 2028 (assuming we’ll still have those, and they’re free and fair)! I really like what I’ve been hearing from him!",Majestic_Electric,2025-04-30T15:58:01,186
">“We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box,” Pritzker said, urging [Democrats](https://www.advocate.com/democratic-party) to abandon “the culture of incrementalism that has led us to swallow the cruelty and the callousness with barely a cowardly croak.”  >“Those same do-nothing Democrats want to blame our losses on our defense of Black people, of trans kids, of immigrants—instead of their own lack of guts and gumption,” he said to loud applause.  >  >Pritzker also called out the targeting of LGBTQ+ people in the [military](http://advocate.com/military) under the Trump administration’s reinstated ban. “Our military service members don’t deserve to be told by a washed-up Fox TV commentator who drank too much and committed sexual assault before being appointed Secretary of Defense that they can’t serve their country simply because they’re Black or gay or a woman,” he said, referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.  >The speech stood in stark contrast to recent comments from [California](http://advocate.com/california) Gov. Gavin Newsom, who [LGBTQ](https://www.pride.com/lgbtq/?utm_campaign=SmartLinks)\+ advocates [widely condemned](https://www.advocate.com/politics/gavin-newsom-abandons-transgender-athletes) in March after [telling right-wing activist Charlie Kirk](https://www.advocate.com/politics/gavin-newsom-abandons-transgender-athletes) that it was “deeply unfair” for [transgender](https://www.advocate.com/transgender?utm_campaign=SmartLinks) girls and women to play sports with their cisgender peers. Newsom’s comments, aired during the launch of his podcast, sparked backlash from Equality California, HRC, and members of California’s LGBTQ+ caucus, who called his remarks “a betrayal.”    Tom Suozzi, Seth Moulton, Gavin Newsom, sit back and take notes.     This is what a true leader and profile in courage looks like.     You don't win against fascism by making concessions with them. They want to essentially commit genocide against trans people, and yet, Democrats are so scared of confronting them on it.      Yet, trans people are not even feeling to go on tour here, having to live through this fascism. Be bold, for real!! Stand for human rights and equality!! I can't believe we fail to learn from previous era's mistakes.",southpawFA,2025-04-30T15:51:25,209

I haven't heard the speech, but this piece makes the governors position clear, and I really am impressed.  Listening to these bigots that use the LGBTQ+ and other minorities as the cause of all that ails America.  It makes me sick to my stomach.  If you single anyone or group out as ""not as good as you.""  You degrade what freedom is for everyone.  I sincerely hope and pray that the democrats find a way to mobilize the masses and fight the repressive authoritarian Republicans.  Good luck...",Troubled202,2025-04-30T16:25:00,64

"“Those same do-nothing Democrats want to blame our losses on our defense of Black people, of trans kids, of immigrants—instead of their own lack of guts and gumption.”  Love to see this and a smart move on his part. He's right, and going after the ineffective actors in the party will be popular. Dem approval ratings are in the tank. Obviously, republicans will disapprove of the dems, the same way dems disapprove of republicans, but a lot of the dem base, myself included, are ticked at our party for their failures, for doing nothing when they had power.  Pritzker can speak to that and put the focus on what we need to focus on while pushing up his Q score well before the 28 election.",travio,2025-04-30T15:53:47,93

"The Illinois governor is quickly becoming one of my favorite politicians on the Democratic side of things.   He is right, and don't let any of these Trump people gaslight you about the social issue shit. They claimed that they cared about the economics, despite the fact that Trump and his team provided no mathematical concepts to prove that they would make life better for the bottom 50% of society, and in fact, have likely made things worse with the cost of everyday goods.   Conservatives and Republicans voted purely on social issues, they are the ones who voted based on that. They knew that Trump has no use for decorum, process, or law, and that he is the best chance that conservatives have of getting abortion fully banned, nullifying and getting rid of gay marriage, as well as getting gender-affirming care outright banned, criminally prosecuted, etc.   They don't care about the economics. They will gladly pay more if Trump fulfills his promise to be a social issues president. Throw some immigration related bigotry in there as well.",AllUsernamesInUse_,2025-04-30T18:27:15,16

"You are out of touch with reality if you think the trans issues were not a factor. Plain and simple people dont want to be told how they are allowed to think and told they are not allowed to debate and discuss things. It happened on reddit. Most Subreddits were controlled by mods that banned any opinions and shut down any discussions or debates no matter if they were in good faith and trying to simply discuss things on a philosophical level and just try to have some nuance.  Debates and discussion are not allowed on most of reddit for instance. Posts with actually debate and discussion are locked and anyone with any opinions that don't align with the moderators are immediately banned.   Republicans purposely chose their battles and those battles were ones they knew they could easily win and they were battles they knew they were partially right about.  Democrats fell for their trap every damn time. Instead of taking the reasonable and nuanced approach, they took a 100% opposition and moronic position every single time.   Just like now, Conservatives are picking the battle over immigrants here on the worst and most exploited method and that is the refugee visa. Why are democrats jumping to the defense of people who were never really supposed to be here in the first place?  Democrats are falling for the republican trap. Democrats are falling on their swords for Immigrants chosen by republicans. Do you think they are going to create martyrs, or do you think Republicans are going to chose people most americans will want gone? Because from what I am seeing Democrats look terrible yet again, because Americans start looking into these people and see immigrants that do deserve deportation.  1. Woke and Cancel culture are absolutely a thing, and I dont know why democrats defended it. Woke people and those types of always online drama creators are not democrats and most have probably never voted. They are just self righteous people looking to get high off of attacking others to prop themselves up. The easiest method to do that is to always defend the underdog.  2. People were absolutely very upset when they were told they could not have opinions on gender and the only thing they are allowed to think was directly against their own ideas about gender.  3. People dont like defending countries whose citizens would behead us or kidnapp us and torture and rape our women.",Ravaha,2025-05-01T08:19:27,1

The republicans do the same shit. Both parties want identity politics to be at the forefront, whether they are trying to be an ally to some group or they are trying to blame some group.

Harris was put in an impossible situation and that's ultimately what lost the election. Too many people felt like the current administration wasn't doing enough to help them or were contributing to things being worse. As part of the current administration, any promise Harris made was immediately met with ""then do it now!"" And any criticism she would've offered would be thrown back in her face.   The Dems are no longer in that situation and are unencumbered as far as messaging goes. And the economic populism is messaging we know that works.

When the fuck do leftists actually start doing any work they claim you are always burdened with?  And swing voters DID think Harris was providing free gender surgery to illegal immigrants. it is ONLY leftists who have this bizarre complaint she didn't ""defend"" us enough as if the swing voter who chose Trump cared in the first place about ANYTHING she would have said. Any defense which leftists would have been ""happy"" with, which is a total lie because leftists would have pretended it never happened anyways just like now, would have made it seem like trans rights were Harris' signature issue and proved Trump's point.

Explain why the 4 years of the admin SHE WAS VP was doesn't count in the ""public discourse of taking a stand on trans right"" but only the literal 3 months were she did say trans people deserve dignity and respect and the law protects their rights? You still don't respond to my actual question because you know you can't. So hey good luck with Trump calling us all child predators instead.  Wow what another great conversation with a leftist. /s Total bullshit and deflection and not an ounce of good faith dialogue to be found.  Good luck with Trump voters then. You aren't getting my engagement any more.  I was in a mental hospital because of a suicide attempt precisely because of Trump's attacks and leftists still bitch about Harris simply talking about the importance of democracy instead of all the stuff she and Biden and Democrats did for trans rights in this country. When do you realize what you are even doing?",silverpixie2435,2025-05-01T12:56:33,-1

"Okay, I think I was misunderstanding why you were giving the conservatives rebuttle to things. I feel like the Dems dont do enough to distance themselves from republicans. I'm tired of hearing that it's because they went too far left when they really didn't.   I think culture war issues and identity politics are something dems message on because it's largely a symbolic thing. They dont have to go against their donors or do anything, particularly cumbersome. I am very socially progressive and nonbinary even, but the best way to improve the lives of marginalized groups is to improve material conditions for everyone. I think the culture war serves the oligarchs most of all.",MalnourishedHoboCock,2025-05-01T07:03:39,3
