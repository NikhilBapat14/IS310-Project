As respondents have soured on Democrats, there hasn’t been a corresponding surge of support for Trump or Republicans in Congress. Most of Trump’s signature policies also remain deeply unpopular across the age group, with none receiving majority support. And, fortunately, there’s a lot of time between now and November 2026 for Democrats to right the ship.

"While it’s fair to critique the Democratic Party—and no political institution is above scrutiny—this comment leans heavily on selective narratives and exaggerations that distort the broader picture.  First, the idea that the Democratic Party ""canceled primaries"" to suppress democracy misrepresents what actually happened. Incumbent presidents of *both* parties historically face minimal opposition during primaries, and state parties make their own decisions about how to conduct them. It’s not unique to Biden or 2024.  Second, Biden’s interactions with anti-war students were about maintaining campus order amid heightened tensions—not an attack on protest itself. It's misleading to portray that as anti-democratic when he has repeatedly affirmed the right to peaceful protest.  Accusations like Hillary Clinton ""ousting Black progressive incumbents"" lack context and nuance. Political endorsements and primary challenges are part of any party’s internal dynamics; they’re not inherently undemocratic or racially motivated.  Also, the idea that the party is a ""huge incoherent mess"" ignores the fact that Democrats have passed major legislation in recent years—from infrastructure to climate to economic relief—and continue to maintain a broad coalition. It's messy, sure—but so is any big-tent party in a two-party system.  Finally, suggesting the only appeal is “not Trump” oversimplifies what’s at stake. Issues like reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ protections, labor laws, environmental policy, and judicial appointments offer a real contrast—and for many voters, those are substantive reasons to stay engaged.  It's important to hold leaders accountable, but we shouldn't fall into cynicism based on cherry-picked grievances or ignore the very real stakes of disengagement.",Suspiria-on-VHS,2025-04-25T21:28:36,1
"They’re not mutually exclusive. And actually the bigger problem *is* actually non-voters: they are the larger group.  Republican voters participate at higher rates, particularly when Trump is on the ballot, because people that lean left are discouraged and apathetic.

"You don’t know what fascist is.  Status quo isn’t great, but it isn’t a coup, deporting citizens, arresting judges, constitutional crisis, and tanking the economy.  Centrist Dems suck. But if it’s between a centrist dem and an actual fucking fascist:  1. You HAVE to vote, because a fascist is on the ballot. That’s a big deal.  2. It’s a pretty obvious choice who to vote for.  You can change the makeup of the party by getting involved.   You can start your own local party or help try to grow some other local/state party. And you should, if they better represent you values and interests. And eventually if that party wins enough people over it will either supplant the Dems, or be absorbed and wield *actual power* to do the things you hope for.  But that takes years. Still, do it, but in the meantime you can’t just not participate. Especially when there is a party (the republicans) actively attempting to disenfranchise millions and restructure the government and laws so that basically the voter base is rich landowning white men. Or worse, fascist, like they are now.  Or I mean, you could, I guess, it would just be really fucking dumb.  Enter most American voters.",amanam0ngb0ts,2025-04-26T09:10:52,0

Clinton did a whole lot of deregulation in the media that helped create the monopolies that exist today.
