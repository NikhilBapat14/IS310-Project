"TLDR; In March 2025, the U.S. trade deficit surged to a record $140.5 billion, **nearly doubling from the previous year**. This spike was largely due to businesses and consumers accelerating imports ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs announced for April 2, dubbed “Liberation Day.” Imports rose to nearly $419 billion, with pharmaceutical products—primarily from Ireland—increasing by $20.9 billion, indicating significant pre-tariff stockpiling. The surge in imports contributed to a 0.3% contraction in U.S. GDP for the first quarter, marking the first decline in three years. Economists anticipate that this import surge is temporary and expect the trade deficit to decrease in the coming months as the effects of the tariffs take hold.",Drtardis95,2025-05-06T23:14:28,18

"Let’s stop feeding the narcissistic machine. Every time we use the T-word, we boost the brand of someone who wants us to obsess over him good or bad. Instead, let’s starve the algorithm. Rename him, deflate him, mock him, or better yet: erase his cultural dominance by refusing to say his name at all. Call him  DRUMPF, the Not-So-Great Pumpkin, Donnie Two-Scoops, Agent Orange, the Fauxphet, Cheeto Caesar, the Bronze Calf, Baron of Bankruptcy, or just The Former Guy. The less we use his real name, the less power he holds let mockery do the talking, and history do the forgetting.",ANONYMOU5COWARD,2025-05-07T03:55:12,2
"The timing makes sense since people and companies probably rushed to buy stuff before the tariffs hit, so imports shot up. After the tariffs start, I bet the numbers will look different, but not sure if it’ll actually help the deficit long term.",UniqueBabeDoll,2025-05-07T05:46:45,2

"The MAGA crowd told me that it is a long run game. Just like I have waited almost 4 months and seeing the federal spending still going up instead of being doge-d. Meanwhile the budget for FY2026 got the DoD budget over 1T.  THen the trade deficit part. ANd then I realize the so called ""Time will tell"", is just a meaningless statement, because it will always stand true until we truly hit a great depression. But then it won't be matter anymore.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-07T07:26:11,2

"To be honest, we couldn't even export even if there's demand. The US doesn't have enough freighters. Export can only happen when freighters from places like China come to offload their goods, then we send them our exports on those same ships.  Trump can't comprehend that if you scare the freighters from docking, our goods can't go out either.",theassassintherapist,2025-05-07T00:34:44,7
