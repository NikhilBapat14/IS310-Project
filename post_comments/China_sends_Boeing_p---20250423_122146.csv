>Boeing's chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them.  Goddamn. That's gonna leave a mark.,def_indiff,2025-04-23T12:32:40,38
"Kinda seems like there should be dozens of American CEOs calling the White House twice a day explaining to the Orange Moron that tariffs are actually going to bankrupt companies, doesn't it?",smersh101,2025-04-23T13:01:29,18

Ha.  Not like that!  Forty-one planes are already built and China won't take them now.  Boeing's acting like they can pivot.  Bail out's brewing.,Accurate-Guava-3337,2025-04-23T12:31:55,17

"Yeah, I'm kind of surprised this mess has gone on as long as it has.  Do these CEOs have no clout?  I mean this is an oligarchy after all, can't we at least get the good parts of an oligarchy if we have to have an oligarchy?",God_Hand_9764,2025-04-23T13:40:10,8
The won’t need to. The new BYDs are nicer than Tesla and they are not associated with Elon and a country that is trying to hurt their economy. Tesla is going to completely fail out of China,Aggressive-Fail4612,2025-04-24T01:13:44,2
"Xi has already said America is only accounts for less than 3% of China’s GDP - they can wait until the adults resume power in America. He also said China was here for 5000 years before America and will continue long after America is gone, they don’t need us.",d_c_d_,2025-04-23T12:44:35,6
"Boeing's order book is full for the next decade.  There won't be any slightly used Boeings on Ebay, as they will just go to the next airline in the queue.  More worrying is the 8000 or so ordered over the next 15 years or so. Chances are the order will go to airbus, or china will start up its own manufacturing.",space_for_username,2025-04-23T17:50:51,1

China already has the Comac in production. The 919 is a direct competitor to the A320 has I believe 12 or 16 units in service and the wide body version is in final development.,MainSailFreedom,2025-04-23T18:35:44,4
"At the end of 2024, Airbus had a backlog of 8,658 aircraft and Boeing's backlog at the end of 2024 was 5,595 aircraft - a significant amount of which are 737s.  In 2024, Airbus produced 820 aircraft while Boeing only delivered 348.  The erosion of Boeings market is well under way and will accelerate under current condisions of quality confidence and US policy.  A once great company and market leader. As DJT would say...sad.
