"I think you have more leverage in negotiation if the parties you're negotiating with feel you're absolutely serious in your stance.  With that said, I \*do\* think that Trump sincerely believes high tariffs are sound economic and trade policy.  He's wrong on that, but his sincerity has led to the happy accident of a better bargaining position.  I also think Trump is capitalist enough, and enough of a politician, that he'll abandon his tariff principles to avoid being associated with wrecking the economy.  So, no, I don't think this has been some 4D chess move, I think things haven't gone to plan, and since Trump is a rational actor in the end, he's adjusting course to make the best of it he can.",bearcatjoe,2025-04-23T04:42:12,30
"All he really wants is to stick it to the chicoms. And they should, no country should be feeding money to that regime when it is using that money to threaten massive turmoil invading taiwan.",Xander_hades_,2025-04-23T08:15:28,2
"Liberals don’t understand how business works.  Every country, and every company, is trying to maximize their profit. Countries will negotiate terms favorable to the U.S. if tariffs make the alternatives less profitable. Companies will bring manufacturing here if tariffs make the alternatives less profitable.   It’s really that simple. All the propaganda about the U.S. being “unpredictable”, “hurting our alliances”, or “pushing others to China” is gaslighting noise meant to distract you from the straightforward mathematics of money.",dunkeater,2025-04-22T23:48:16,-23
"I fully agree with you, but “fellow conservatives” in here who are suddenly economic experts (that just suddenly popped up in this sub overnight when tariffs were announced) obviously disagree.   I don’t apologize and don’t give a rip about downvotes.",ITrCool,2025-04-23T07:08:10,2
