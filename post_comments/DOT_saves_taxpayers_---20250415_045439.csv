So when are they going to cancel the California slush fund high speed rail that has cost billions and has nothing to show for it?,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-15T06:03:51,30
">DOT said the capital cost for the project is believed to be more than $40 billion  As I'm sure that's a conservative estimate...  this was barely a drop in the bucket.    While I'm sure such a line would be great...  for ""Nearly 100,000 Texans, sometimes called “super-commuters,” travel back and forth between Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth more than once a week..."", there's really no reason the entire United States tax base should foot the bill for such a luxury for so few.",bozoconnors,2025-04-15T08:31:47,15
"I would love for this to be built, but the fact is, these projects cost tax payers a ton of money.",dont-CA-my-TX,2025-04-15T09:17:20,3
"Public transport funding needs to get sidelined until we implement ways to make it pleasant to use.   It shouldn't smell like weed. There shouldn't be music blasted out of smartphones. There shouldn't be heroin addicts nodding off. There shouldn't be people pissing themselves. There shouldn't be dance teams nearly kicking people in the head. There shouldn't be unhinged, unmedicated homeless people muttering violent threats.   It should be as clean and safe as it is in Japan. This is a reasonable expectation. They're a poorer country and can pull it off.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-15T11:44:46,-3
"Funny, they started that back in 2008 with a statewide vote, finally broke ground in 2015.  And they still haven’t connected SanFran to LA.  They haven’t ran one train as of today.  Florida’s high speed rail started in 2012 with planning, broke ground with   rail that connects Ft Lauderdale to West Palm Beach in 2014.  They were running trains from Orlando to West Palm Beach by 2018.  As of 2023 the service between Orlando and Miami was running.  Florida’s high speed rail used zero State funds. It was a purely private venture.  Kinda says it all.",cliffotn,2025-04-15T13:58:33,9
"This will never be built, too many people getting rich off of it moving as slow as possible",apollyon_53,2025-04-15T11:26:23,10
"Japan is 99% Japanese people, the havent decimated their own population with foreign trouble makers. That is why they have such a safe country, nothing to do with wealth.",Xander_hades_,2025-04-15T15:11:46,4
