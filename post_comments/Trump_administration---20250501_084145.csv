"400 pages of lies, citing the likes of the NYT and Cass, to lay the groundwork to justify banning trans healthcare for youth first and then certainly for adults. Any news org that gives this report credence is complicit in the eradication of trans people in the US. This will only harm us.

I had gender dysphoria when I was 10 years old. I think it's really funny these guys are so offended about it they need to try to pretend like it's not a thing.,TrickEnvironmental44,2025-05-01T09:10:04,19
"Their bibliography at the end of the report lists twitter posts, a German article they never translated(and contradicts thrm), lies repeatedly about literally everything, and even a ""404 not found"" named in the bibliography ""404 not found.""  The truth is, gender affirming care saves lives. Yes, even for teenagers.  Forcing someone to go through their entire puberty is like forcing someone to wait until a broken leg heals before you put a cast on it. You are in effect telling them to ""walk it off,"" and ignoring that your lack of action is causing permanent damage.  Lifelong trauma, hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of surgeries, constant fear without the safety of passing. A complete lack of socialization with their peers.  You're practically telling trans kids to just die. And many of them do. In a home that isn't supportive, suicidality is a coin flip. With support, it's around 1 in 5.  With support and gender affirming care, it's about 1 in 12, which is quite close to the general population numbers now.",QaraKha,2025-05-01T10:42:10,20

"Every Gen Xer and Millineal who raised their kids to question everything and then turned their back on them when they did and now support this trash should feel a deep sense of shame and guilt over what they have wrought.  In many cases, this is the counter cultural expression of kids railing (rightfully, and according to parents' guidance) against patriarchy, toxic and destructive masculinity, and rigid gender roles.

"There's far more to the trans community than counter cultural expression, obviously. But there is a large swath of the younger generation that is decidedly tolerant and supportive as allies who have, in some cases, adopted cultural aspects of that community. Within that constellation of beliefs lies also notions of mutual aid, restorative justice, and a whole host of political concepts young people are shouldering (at great stress), and at the center of it is their exploration of themselves and their peers outside of the framework of the gender ideologies that preceded them.   Not only am i blaming their parents for not supporting them, I'm blaming them for their hypocrisy, coming as they (we, I am from that generation) have from eras that also directly challenged what came before us. LGBTQ inclusivity, racial inclusivity, early attempts at mitigating misogyny-- those are supposed hallmarks of both generations, but as soon as their kids did something similar and in far less cruel, exclusionary ways, they, like their garbage pile boomer parents, turned their back on the American project they themselves were once part of.   I have plenty of anecdotal experience with this, but the data in the link within this thread tells that story better. I don't think it's a universal trait, but the douche bags amongst those generations clearly outnumbered the people who recognize that inclusivity is the exact thing that identifies and expands American liberty, and you have to attack the former first to get to where we are now.   What i said is directed at those who started out believing one thing and as soon as they were confronted with something that made them feel old and obsolete, they voted to demolish the country, as MAGA does.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-01T10:32:27,3
> That does not mean you put the 99.99 percent of the other people out in the cold  I always find the de-transition argument silly for that reason.  The % of trans people who choose to detransition is lower than the % of people who are trans.
