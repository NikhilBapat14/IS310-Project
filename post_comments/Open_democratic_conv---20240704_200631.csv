"The real question is: who are the delegates?  All candidates select their own delegates when they win a primary. The delegates as incredibly loyal to the party, but also loyal to that specific candidate.  We'd be speculating, but I suspect Biden would have significant influence over who the replacement should be because these are his delegates. It's a longshot to think it wouldn't be Harris, and politically smart for Democrats to immediately unify behind a single candidate rather than dragging out a fractious convention process. While Harris is not perfect - and very likely would not have won an open primary - she has the campaign infrastructure and name ID to give Democrats their best chance at success. We're only 4 months from election day and Biden hasn't even passed the torch yet, he may take weeks to make his decision.",FiveDollarHoller,2024-07-06T11:44:53,2
