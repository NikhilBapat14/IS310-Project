"As President Donald Trump hit the 100-day mark this week for his second term in office, his approval numbers were lower than for any administration at this point in over seven decades.  Don’t tell that to the crypto community.  Trump ran for office on a promise to make America “the crypto capital of the world.” Those who got behind that message say he’s already delivered, or at least gotten off to a hot start.  A blitz of executive actions, strategic appointments, and early wins, from the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to the rollback of enforcement-heavy SEC tactics, has left the industry feeling more welcome in Washington, D.C., than ever.

I doubt there will be much positive movement.   Although I'm a very small player in the crypto/NFT game.,TripleDoubleFart,2025-05-01T08:11:54,1

"Ah the Biden years.   According to experts,  Biden's  chips and green act actually was doing what trump thinks his tariffs are going to do. But Trump broke all that.   Biden was also the first president in decades to use the anti trust laws to go after monopolies for raising prices and hurting small businesses. I do believe Trump is allowing one of those to continue. Correct me if I'm wrong.   Biden was turning the ship of state into the new New Deal. Perhaps it was contrition for years of sucking up to corporate masters in Delaware. No clue, but the turnaround was an exciting time for the country.  Most people were still suffering, and Biden didn't have the charisma to keep them faithfully holding on.   However if we only knew that telling the court to go fk itself was an option, we could have had so much more , so much more quickly. Stupid Dems fir following rules , laws, process. /s  Sadly Buden should have held to his promise that he would be a temporary one term president.",SicilyMalta,2025-05-01T09:11:51,1
Zero would be an improvement but considering the sheer amount of energy wasted passing fake currency between speculators I'd argue there is quite a significant negative societal value.,jaywastaken,2025-05-01T08:05:47,4

"The whole point of currency, the whole reason we came up with money to begin with, was to have a consistent way to exchange goods and services. When your alleged currency changes value more often than Trump changes diapers, it's worthless as a currency. How can two people have an equitable exchange if the value of he currency can swing wildly in favor of one party or the other mid-transition? It's just so stupid and pointless.",Toy_Guy_in_MO,2025-05-01T08:30:17,1
