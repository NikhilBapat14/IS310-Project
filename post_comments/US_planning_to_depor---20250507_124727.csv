Somebody needs to deport Donald Trump to Russia since he loves Putin so much. 😄,[deleted],2025-05-07T12:49:14,11
">Luca Casarini, the Italian founder of the NGO Mediterranea Saving Humans, said the reported move by Trump was “an endorsement of the horror that has characterised his administration’s policies since the very beginning”. > >‘‘Libya is one of the most hellish places on Earth, where mafias and smugglers operate with the complicity of the European Union. But Trump goes a step further. The American president claims ownership of this horror by deporting people to a hell that is Libya, flaunting his power. It is a move that drags our civilisation toward the abyss.’’",jellyrollo,2025-05-07T12:50:33,9

Every single country these migrants are fleeing from are in very bad condition. That's why they left in the first place to seek asylum.  It is against international law to deport anyone who have not committed any crimes.,wizgset27,2025-05-07T13:00:53,5

"A Trump advisor was in Rwanda last month touring a mine that produces raw material for tungsten, used in military equipment. And from a recent Atlantic council report: Libya’s National Oil Corporation announced in January that the country will soon hold a public tender for exploring key gas and oil plots, the first such bid since 2007. Much of Libya’s territorial waters and 70 percent of its land area remain unexplored and are projected to hold vast basins of petroleum and gas reserves. But the round is set to occur against the backdrop of a decade-old stalemate between the Tripoli-based Government of National Unity (GNU) and Tobruk-based House of Representatives (HoR). Since 2014, the warring factions have failed to agree on a pathway for national elections and a political reconciliation process. The crisis is one that the US and Italy may be uniquely postured, and incentivized, to quell.",Huge_Excitement4465,2025-05-08T18:56:16,1

No. Most of the people sent to CECOT were not from there. A lot of them were from Venezuela. So you can guarantee that the majority will not be from Libya,mymar101,2025-05-07T14:05:24,8

It wouldn’t be deportation.  It would be exile.  People need to stop using the word deportation so loosely.   Not that I don’t share your particular sentiment.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-07T13:04:30,6

"Who decides they’re illegal? If there isn’t due process, then it’s not a judge. This isn’t a government deporting illegals, it’s a government kidnapping people they find undesirable.
