"Trump has taken shots at Fox before and they always just sink lower and lower to catch his saggy nuts in their mouth like usual.  Unfortunately, this means nothing.",Spam_Hand,2025-04-24T17:55:19,17

What were they supposed to do? Make up a poll? It’s Fox. If they could’ve spun it into something good for Trump they would have. There just is no way to refute raw data.,Amehoelazeg,2025-04-24T18:05:34,5
I for one am happy that they're fighting. The more the better.,MrLurid,2025-04-24T18:08:51,4

It’s always someone else’s fault.  Always someone else to blame and point a finger at.  What a coward.  What a buffoon.,Kantsas,2025-04-24T18:27:37,1
Trump and Rupert play this game all the time.,williamgman,2025-04-24T19:11:39,1
"""frames [him] in negative light""?  lol  ffs  how about ""finds the convicted felon & his actions are increasingly unpopular""?",realancepts4real,2025-04-24T20:54:14,1
He should sue Fox for $20 billion like he did with CBS or have the FCC go after them like NBC.,Zocalo_Photo,2025-04-24T22:19:42,1

Trump is in grievance mode 24/7. His weakness is never not on full display.,No_big_whoop,2025-04-25T08:27:03,1

"What's worse is that Murdoch plays all sides. Because he owns so many media outlets, he can have Fox riding the Trump train and the The Wall Street Journal tearing Trump apart for ""the dumbest trade war ever"".",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-24T18:43:53,4

This old fool is gonna be in the 30s with 3+ years left. Not sure what that means but it's a rarity.,WOKEmeupb4yougogo,2025-04-24T17:58:41,2
"I mean their polling is as accurate as anyone elses, they just won't mention the bad parts for republicans on their televised shows because they have to still push a narrative.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:18:55,1
Yes. That's exactly what he want them to do. Make it up... just like the do in other fascist states.,pickus_dickus,2025-04-25T03:12:58,1
"Their polling is actually some of the most accurate out there. It's genuinely shocking how the network is, by their own admission, ""entertainment"" but the polling is genuinely great.",Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-24T18:41:24,2
"That's what I was saying, they have to be pretty accurate with polling like that's a given like fox news polling and fox news editorial/TV are like entirely different organisations when it comes to politics.",LegitimatelisedSoil,2025-04-24T18:42:43,1
