"Unfortunately one of the most, only really, skillful things Maga has done is to in-effectuate oppositional protests.

They see deep state employees who were paid to be there. They see a psyop. They see crazy people who want to mutilate children and burn our country to the ground. Anything but honest people demanding a better way, because to them there is no better way. To them, this administration is the ***best thing to ever happen to America***.  That means to truly get our message out, we have to step things up. However, then they’ll just call us terrorists, rioters, traitors… whatever they need to. Then they’ll call for martial law, and yet we’d still have to stand our ground. Despite the fact it will change nothing.   Protests are great and we should keep doing them, however this is more to let the rest of the world know that an enormous part of our population simply will not stand for this. This can eventually help us recover as a nation of influence and good will after this regime is past us. And it will be one day or another.  For now, all we can really do to affect change is to vote. Write our congresspeople demanding they fight back as hard as we - their constituents - are. We need to make it clear that they will never be re-elected again if they do not stand with us. That their failing to do so is exactly why the Democratic party’s approval rating is even worse than Trump’s  We need to galvanize a blue wave unlike anything our country has ever seen.
