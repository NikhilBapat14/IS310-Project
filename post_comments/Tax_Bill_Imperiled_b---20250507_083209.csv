"  Snippet:  >Rep. Don Bacon has become known as a rare House Republican who regularly criticizes President Trump’s actions. Now his vote could be crucial to Trump’s tax plans.   >The Nebraska centrist is warning that House GOP leaders are putting battleground members like him in a particularly precarious political position—and imperiling the GOP majority in the next elections—if they opt to make deep cuts to Medicaid to help pay for the president’s [“big, beautiful” bill](https://archive.is/o/yjdf0/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/republican-trump-tax-bill-gop-votes-7ffc2581) that extends 2017 tax cuts and add new breaks.  >Bacon, 61 years old, is on board with enacting money-saving work requirements on able-bodied users and more frequent eligibility checks for the health-insurance program, which serves low-income and disabled people. But while the House Energy and Commerce committee is looking for nearly $900 billion in reductions over 10 years, largely from healthcare, **Bacon says taking any more than $500 billion from Medicaid is too much.**   >*And he says some Republican leaders have privately tried to get him to drop his objections by saying any steep reductions passed by the House would be blocked by the Senate anyway.*  >“Here’s the tactic they’ve been using: ‘Don’t worry about the Senate. They’ll fix it.’ And now we’re getting ready to take our third vote on this,” Bacon said in a recent interview, referring to earlier steps in the budget process. “We feel like we’re being pushed up to the edge of the cliff here.”  [https://archive.is/20250507092923/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/don-bacon-medicaid-tax-bill-trump-56423cd8#selection-2697.11-2713.299](https://archive.is/20250507092923/https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/don-bacon-medicaid-tax-bill-trump-56423cd8#selection-2697.11-2713.299)",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T08:34:34,8

"Ah, the most quintessential response from the ""party of personal responsibility""  >And he says some Republican leaders have privately tried to get him to drop his objections by saying any steep reductions passed by the House would be blocked by the Senate anyway.

"Nah, don’t be fooled. He’s my rep. His resistance is fueled entirely by his fear of not being reelected in a district that swung for the Democratic candidate in the last two presidential elections. You’ll notice that his response is about saving his own ass, not saving healthcare for those in need. If he were in a safe Republican district he would vote for the cuts.",tresnueve,2025-05-07T10:01:48,5
"And, just to cover their asses!  Though I believe in transparency, there are times, like these, that I know if they were able to vote anonymously, I know at least one or two (maybe more??) would vote against Trump. (To make it count..)  Perhaps just wishful thinking..??",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-07T08:55:40,2

"He’s floating the idea of retiring after this term. Maybe why he’s pushing back, or could just be a show and he’ll vote in line with Trump’s wants",jbelt1213,2025-05-07T14:29:33,1
