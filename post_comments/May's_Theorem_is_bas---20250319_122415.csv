"Maybe I'm just too much of a pragmatist when it comes to election systems, but it seems like the theorem is tautological. It presupposes the values sought and then describes the type of rule created by predicting the outcome of those values. For instance the voting population having time and opportunity for reasoned discourse seems like an important democratic value, but it isn't one of the four.    IMO, for your thought experiment to mean anything, *everything* has to be based on majority rule. Everything can be challenged at any time except for creating new election rules. No codified law, no institutions, no Madisonian structure. Every single social agreement is a common law precedent that can be overturned. It's too many decision points for humans. You would need voting to be done constantly in real time through a network of AI connected intimately with every single voter. Government by penny stock trading. Twitch Plays Government. But the minute you flip the switch to start that voting system, disenfranchisement starts. The optimal preference of the majority will, untethered from inalienable rights or other democratic protections, is to eliminate people who are inconvenient to the majority. That means policies favoring disenfranchisement, deportation, and death for disfavored people at the margins. And that's before the voting hivemind reacts to news about anything happening in the world whatsoever. At that point it becomes a self-consuming fire that burns itself out rather quickly.",Tempest_True,2025-03-19T19:28:05,5
"If that isn't an option to protect political underdogs, there are still some options left to try depending on what you look around for. A universal suffrage system where all citizens at least sixteen (it will work similarly with 18 but given that I see successful countries like Scotland and Austria and Malta with this lower age) can vote. If we use Australian type rules of compulsory voting, then we can get turnouts of roughly 90-95%. A proportional electoral system like the Netherlands or Ireland or Switzerland or New Zealand (among many others to choose from) will create a legislature that is minimally likely to distort the citizenry, and also is likely to divide up the majority into groups that will be less likely to abuse any majority status. A ranked ballot or a runoff ballot for presidential elections can be used to guarantee similar things for the head of state. Proportional representation can also apply to splitting up committee chairships and even give each significant party a vice-speaker, balancing power that way.  In this kind of environment, we could try a parliamentary republic with some notable powers for a president to defend some people who might not otherwise align so well, such as the right to send a bill to court prior to signing it into law to see if it is constitutional, or perhaps to the people for a plebiscite (probably only if a significant minority in the legislature support such a move), and being able to compel the legislature to revote and take a majority vote again, perhaps on individual sections of bills, which are pretty common presidential powers. They might have operational freedom to choose some of the judges of the highest court so as to deprive a prime minister with a solid legislative majority from being able to control everything, which is the way a good number of parliamentary republics already work as in Czechia.  If supermajorities for impeachment are not permitted, then another option is to make the people the arbiter of dismissal, and with a low threshold of a majority vote needed to trigger such a vote, perhaps using such a tool arbitrarily could be dissuaded with a tool like automatic dissolution of parliament if the recall vote fails to pass the voters. Iceland and Austria have impeachments like this and they don't remove presidents arbitrarily.  Majorities could be required to be sustained over time. You could make the terms of the highest judges say twelve years (in a legislative term of four years) and make a third of them chosen every 4 years. Odds are pretty good that the judges will take a broader view of things like that. Same with independent commissions doing things like running elections, auditing things, managing the board of say a public broadcaster or whoever else deals with airwaves, which could be divided up over time (one appointed every year for seven year terms?). And amending the constitution could be done with a double majority over time, such as approving of the amendment, then dissolve parliament, then vote on whether to amend the constitution again, and maybe hold a referendum too, these being the kinds of rules seen in Denmark to amend the constitution where this is exactly what happens (needing at least a majority of those voting in favour, who are at least 40% of all voters, to agree to change the constitution).",Awesomeuser90,2025-03-19T12:24:25,1
">majority rule has the mathematical properties of guaranteeing a decision can be made, treats all votes equally, & neither favours nor disfavours the status quo.  Tbh, that doesn't seem remotely certain to me. In fact, the more I learn history, the more it seems that democracy is a kind of ""race to the low-middle"" in terms of quality of leadership and policy. More often than not it seems to produce tepid mediocrity and stifle reform.  The problem is that the alternatives, even though they occasionally produce the best outcome (benevolent dictators, of which there are a handful in history) it also produces the worst tyrannies. So, Idk what to do, but I'm not really convinced that more democracy is what's going to help. I think the public can make really bad decisions and doesn't need to be trusted to determine everything.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-03-19T12:39:36,0
"It is more precisely expressed in the papers I talked about.   Switzerland has been going with democracy of this nature for a long time, voters are quite typically making decisions at least as good as a representation based system would in the same place, let alone trying to govern with the military or a strongman or other aristocracy. When Ireland has a citizen assembly convened six times in the last decade by random chance, they've produced outcomes that seem at least reasonable.",Awesomeuser90,2025-03-19T13:36:34,2
"What history of democracies are you referring to? Or are you ascribing to democracies the faults of republics, such as the United States?",ResurgentOcelot,2025-03-19T23:32:48,0
