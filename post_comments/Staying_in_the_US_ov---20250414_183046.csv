If you planning on coming to the US. Don't. You are not safe here. You are walking into a fascist regime hell bent on making an example of anyone who is not snow-white.,ScotchCigarsEspresso,2025-04-14T19:30:06,43

"I would just advise anyone who is thinking of coming here to save their money and stay away. And if you're thinking of leaving the US, be prepared to not be let back in",Rosebunse,2025-04-14T20:23:58,12

Come to Canada. We have maple cookies.,Gransmithy,2025-04-15T08:51:07,2
"When I was in the USAF, I had a girlfriend from the UK whom I met while I was stationed there.  She came to the States for 90-day stints to see me.  The idea that it's been cut down to 30 days or else she'd have had to register. Or that if we had gotten married, she'd still be able to be deported. It's maddening.  But hey, she's white, so I guess they'd have left her alone...",Daigle4ME,2025-04-16T07:46:27,1
"Pre... say 2016, did you ever, in your wildest dream, imagine you be saying that to anyone coming to the US?  The temperature has been rising, we've been acclimating and disassociating. If we could see what's going on today from pre-Trump we would realize things are *WAY* worse than we imagine.",MillieMouser,2025-04-14T20:52:38,18
"Useful things to know:  * [REAL ID](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id) deadline for domestic US travel is May 7, 2025. If your US driver's license doesn't have a big star in the upper right corner, it's not a REAL ID. A REAL ID says you're a US citizen, and mostly immune to ICE detention. At airports, there are some other acceptable IDs, but expect some additional hassle and delay.  * Married women who changed their name when married may have to prove all name changes since birth to get a REAL ID. So dig up all those old marriage and divorce certificates. * A REAL ID may be required to enter some government buildings and installations.  * A REAL ID is *not* required to buy a gun.",Animats,2025-04-14T22:00:53,7
"Come to Australia instead. All our animals and plants will and can kill you but mate, the weather is fucking awesome and we don’t have Trump.",MontasJinx,2025-04-14T21:57:18,6
Nope. never. Starting to think we really did split the timeline somewhere.,ScotchCigarsEspresso,2025-04-14T20:54:11,12
"I am my wife's second husband. She didn't change her name back after getting divorced, but we both hyphenated our names with each other's given names. I had to have her first marriage certificate and divorce decree along with ours to get the REAL ID. Shit was such a hassle",sharkbait_oohaha,2025-04-14T22:34:00,5
"REAL ID doesn't prove citizenship, you need an Enganced ID which is only produced in certain states.  The star only indicates that certain security checks were performed and it contains specific security features. Non-citizen residents can obtain a REAL ID when they apply for a driver's license. (Source, the internet and my husband's REAL ID from before he was a US citizen)",No_Library6425,2025-04-15T01:19:05,1
Your real ID only works if they believe it's real...  Reasons due process is important.,Daigle4ME,2025-04-16T07:47:58,1

Things haven’t been the same since Robin Williams and David Bowie died. Fuck you 2016.,MontasJinx,2025-04-14T21:56:27,4
You're right. A green card is enough for a REAL ID. And a green card doesn't mean much under Trump.,Animats,2025-04-15T17:54:01,2
"That depends on who you ask. As an immigrant to several countries myself I would say no. Besides, this relates short term stays over 30 days.",MontasJinx,2025-04-14T22:53:20,3
"Ok I guess [https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release) not as low as post covid, but below the long term average. Real estate/housing is definately an issue but its kinda like that everywhere. Oh, and you can call our Prme Minister a dick to his face on telly and its quite ok. In fact its kinda expected.",MontasJinx,2025-04-15T01:49:36,2
