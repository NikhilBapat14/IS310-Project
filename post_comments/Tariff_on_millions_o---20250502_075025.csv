"Families relying on affordable goods (that's almost everyone) are about to get hurt really badly.   Then, megacorps start producing domestically using automation and robots, wealth continues to slide upward until money becomes meaningless and the ultra wealthy begin to accumulate something even more refined-raw power.   What do you spend raw power on? Servitude and worship. If you're a Trump worshipper now, you already know how to live like a fawning imbecile devoid of dignity. Now you can start to transfer that to Musk and the tech bros! Robot masters and the God Emporer with his weird order of religious fanatics from the Heritage Foundation!  Great job, MAGA. Great country you're trying to impose here. Great worldview.",BarbaGramm,2025-05-02T08:06:54,27
"Just to be clear, the tariffs on bulk shipping were already in effect. These are the tariffs on goods shipped over by courier, in small amounts. Like, if I buy something from a guy in China, and he sends it over to me via USPS or something, that’s now subject to heavy tariffs. Temu and Shein were doing most of their business this way.",Independent-End-2443,2025-05-02T10:00:28,5
"So, this means that inflation just went up by 20% ... right?",phosdick,2025-05-02T07:53:51,9
I was frankly amazed that there was that big of an exception.  In my country anything over 50 euros that you order from a foreign country gets taxed.   I even had to pay customs on some things sent to us by American cousins because they've put the value over 50 euros.,Eat_the_Rich1789,2025-05-02T07:56:03,5
"And now it begins, once US warehouses empty out ""new"" of everything will substantially increase in price, for example Xbox newest announcement.",FlyingRock,2025-05-02T08:00:00,6
"It could be possible to avoid the chaos by telling people what the tariff revenue is going to pay for. Like, do we get affordable healthcare? Or does Donald just get to keep the money?",30mil,2025-05-02T07:55:22,4
This single decision might generate more anger than Tariffs.    Will people finally realize now the consumer pays the tax?,arazamatazguy,2025-05-02T10:27:04,4
"Don't forget the impact this has on a very, very large number of small and home-based businesses.  Most of us relied on the de minimis exemption to order in supplies to make products for resale.  Many low income households rely on this income to get by.  I run a small lapidary business and because of the tariffs and the elimination of the exemption we are likely going to close once current stock is exhausted.  There's just no way we can absorb a 145% increase in costs.  Even if I tried to pass it on to my customers there's no market for the items at that price.  Who is going to pay it?  Before someone chimes in about buying American.  The products I need are not made in the US.  They are only produced in China and a lesser extent Thailand.  A good friend has run a home-based custom vinyl business producing t-shirts, totes, signs, etc for nearly 12 years.  It has supported her family through all sorts of hardships.  The cost of supplies is shyrocketing.  Wholesalers have already started raising prices. Her raising prices to compensate is only hurting sales.  She is on the verge of losing everything in a few months if something doesn't change.  These stories are being repeated all over Etsy, Amazon Handmade, and small Mom and Pop shops everywhere.  These changes aren't just making the ""cheap stuff"" on Temu, Shein, and AliExpress more expensive.  It's not just hurting Soccer Moms and Fashionistas.  It's hurting entrepreneurs, small business owners, and families.  ---  Just to drive the point home let me provide an example.  Yesterday, I looked at replacing some material I am almost out of.  Taking one as an example, 45g of it costs $15.00.  The wholesaler broke the cost out.  Item Cost: $15.00  Shipping: Free - For this example  Tax: .90 - I'll include it for the example  Other Fees (Tariffs): $21.75  Total: $37.64  So, a supply that used to cost me .35c per gram now costs me .84c per gram.  Doesn't seem like much on this scale, but multiply that kind of increase over and over again.  What business can absorb that kind of increase in costs?  Not many.",Hypothesising_Null,2025-05-02T10:21:34,2

"A lot of us take exception with the way our customs duties were being exploited by China.  Our minimum wasn't intended for for billions of dollars in goods getting drop shipped from over seas.  All of that could have been fixed with comprehensive analysis and legislation.  Things like phased implementation and consistent application of rules, increased customs staff, and, yes, lowering the minimum value at which duties are collected, would help fix the issue without overly dampening trade in the short term.  I have no faith that anything coming from our federal government will be handled with anything approaching competence.  It would have been better to do nothing than to leave it to this admin.",DeliberatelyDrifting,2025-05-02T08:40:03,2

"It’s not just tariffs though. Trump is plundering education funds, research funds, FEMA surplus monies, thousands in federal pensions, benefits and wages from those he fired, billable hours in the billions from supplicant law firms, billions in USAID, on + on…      And he wants to go to Fort Knox to look at the gold. Uh huh. Biggest heist in American history.",ramdom-ink,2025-05-02T09:01:45,5
The plan is and has always been to use increased tariff revenues to pay for tax cut for rich folk.  That's why every single business is very quiet on the economic disaster Trump is driving us into.  They are all expecting to get their tax cuts and even bigger bonuses.,vaskov17,2025-05-02T09:25:49,5
