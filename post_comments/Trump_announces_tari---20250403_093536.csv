Looks like some people may be catching on to the fact that the current administration isn’t being truthful.  Would’ve been cool if someone could have pointed out that this current, ‘fake news’ administration, built off lies, was full of a bunch of liars.",InitialSwan32,2025-04-03T09:47:27,49

"EU here—I'm not great with numbers (dyscalculia, so I apologize if this sounds incoherent). However, does this homo non sapiens realize that the U.S. runs a significant services trade surplus with the EU? If the EU imposes tariffs on that sector, the U.S. would face substantial losses.  These homo non sapiens only talk about eggs, beef , cars like we are in neolithic period ( minus the cars ) but this is 2025;  we have  • Financial services  Tech & digital services  Business & professional services  Transportation & logistics  Intellectual property & royalties  Tourism & travel  Medical & healthcare services  Another thing what I think he might be doing is trying purposely to make dollar weak to make national debt less but other countries know this , I mean we aren't exactly dumb in Europe, and then we will stop all together having anything to do with US. This is such a risky move ...  Hopefully someone smart in economy can explain this better. One thing I know is that on democrats subreddit there are always smart people.",pianoavengers,2025-04-03T09:58:56,22
"So... we Japanese are confused too, and the saddest thing is that the Japanese government is so naive, and they tried their best to understand the reason behind it and they failed lol  ""### “There’s absolutely no basis for it” — Agriculture Minister Eto criticizes Trump administration's 24% tariff on Japan    \*\*Minister Takaichi also criticizes Japanese government's response: “We can’t see who is taking command.”\*\*    Japan’s Agriculture Minister has sharply criticized the Trump administration’s announcement of a 24% tariff on Japanese products, questioning, \*“Why impose a 24% tariff on Japan? There’s absolutely no basis for it.”\*    At a press conference, former President Donald Trump claimed Japan imposes an effective 46% tariff when including non-tariff barriers, and announced a policy to impose a roughly half-sized 24% tariff on Japanese imports in response.    In reaction, Agriculture Minister Taku Eto stated:    \> \*\*Taku Eto, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries:\*\*    \> “He seems to have included things like non-tariff barriers to come up with this 46% figure, but there’s absolutely no basis for it.”    Eto emphasized that unless Trump clearly explains where the ""46%"" figure comes from, Japan can't even begin to analyze the claim.    Regarding Trump's assertion that “Japan imposes a 700% tariff on rice,” Eto dismissed it, saying:    \> “Even if you calculate it logically, you don’t arrive at such a number. It’s incomprehensible.”    Amid these developments, \*\*former Minister for Economic Security Sanae Takaichi\*\*, a member of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), also voiced criticism—this time toward her own government’s handling of the situation.    \> \*\*Sanae Takaichi, Former Minister for Economic Security (LDP):\*\*    \> “No one was appointed to lead the response and immediately fly to Washington. We can’t even tell who’s taking charge of the situation. I honestly think that’s a serious issue—it’s extremely disappointing.”    Takaichi also pointed out that despite a publicized timeline for Trump’s tariff announcement, \*\*Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Muto\*\* did not visit the U.S. or negotiate with his American counterparts, suggesting Japan failed to demonstrate any real seriousness or urgency in its response.

Markets don’t like 30-50% reduction in estimated imports that the US has no ability to replace for at least several years. I’m shocked!,HasswatBlockside,2025-04-03T10:29:48,5

I saw that post too.  It's like the OP saw this was bad but wanted others to tell him how to spin it into good news.   Most replies seems to say it's how we place ourselves better for trade and few seemed to acknowledge that it's essentially a poor tax to offset the rich tax cuts.,masterbatesAlot,2025-04-03T13:57:40,6
