"The article claims the war on drugs was a mistake resulting in the birth and growth of the drug cartels.  While this contains an element of truth, it ignores a larger truth: If all drugs were legal, drug cartels would still exist....only, they would be operating within the law (read: Big Pharma). Worse, legalization would result in many more Americans suffering the debilitating reality of drug addiction than we have today. Just as alcoholism is far more pervasive than heroin addiction today because the former is legal and the latter isn't, the destruction of the social fabric of the nation would be far worse than it already is today if all drugs were legal.  Opium was made legal in China in the 19th century so that Britain could finance its imperial ambitions. The result was mass addiction and a dysfunctional society....so much so that the Chinese fought two wars to rid their society of the scourge.  I understand the philosophical premise of libertarian arguments that people ought to have the freedom to destroy their lives with drug addiction if they so choose. My problem is with those who suggest we'd all be better off in the process.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-04T08:20:28,14
"Minimum wage was instituted in 1939 By Roosevelt. It was touted to be able to raise people out of poverty.  Since then, there is no documented, verifiable case of anyone being lifted out of poverty.  What it does do is raise the wages that are taxed and the government ends up with MORE tax money to waste.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-04T22:40:27,1
