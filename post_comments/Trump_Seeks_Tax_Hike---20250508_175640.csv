What horrific stuff will they attach to this bill to make Democrats look bad?,HorseFace-Killa,2025-05-08T18:01:55,29
Those making $2.5 million or more typically aren’t making that from salary. I’m sure his concept of a plan allows for less taxes on capital gains etc. and is only to look like he is helping the working class while absolutely sticking his tiny hands in the government coffers.,anoninor,2025-05-08T18:16:34,13

"He's also seeking to buy Canada and Greenland, reopen Alcatraz, build the wall, and turn Gaza into a Trump resort, among many other wacky ""plans.""",30mil,2025-05-08T18:04:42,9
It’s a ruse. It’ll be placed in the plan then voted down somehow and the Dems will get blamed.,livelaughoral,2025-05-08T18:00:17,12
This stinks of either a ruse or a trap.,LordSiravant,2025-05-08T18:13:02,3

"""Trump Seeks Tax Hike on Wealthy Earning $2.5 Million or More"" Apparently, the convicted felon and sexual predator occupying the oval office heard from someone that his dupes are restless about how much more his taxes will be taking from them. So, a quick leak about taxing the wealthy will quiet them down. And, when that doesn't happen, he throws his Congressional dupes under the bus and comes out smelling like....an old man with shit in his pants, as usual.",keninsd,2025-05-08T18:51:20,2

2.5 is what is claimed as income. It’s a trick. At that level of income you are burying millions on tax deductions and debt as income.,stickercollectors,2025-05-09T08:17:02,1

They are trying to cut the corporate tax from 21% to 15%.  The Ways and Means committee released a tax law wishlist back in January and some of the proposals include  1. Taxing non-profit hospitals  2. Taxing Credit Unions  3. Eliminating all education related deductions and credits 4. Eliminating the charitable deduction  There are many many more,Al_Tilly_the_Bum,2025-05-08T18:05:52,29
No evidence but I bet you this Trump gold card for foreign citizens is gonna somehow carry a tax exemption with it.,Ok_Music_7863,2025-05-08T19:40:41,6
"there are a lot of executives, bankers and lawyers making $2.5M/yr in salary and bonuses.  he's also going after the carried interest tax break.  more can be done of course but these are a good start",Ask_DontTell,2025-05-09T00:33:32,1
Trump: Sure. Trump when he realizes he's a billionaire: Ban it because DEI stuff,arilupe,2025-05-08T18:08:10,3
"well, billionaires typically make more than $250m, right? so on the very off chance this does go through, i would think the billionaires would be included.  but im a poor, so, can't confirm.",robotdesignwerks,2025-05-08T18:09:58,2
