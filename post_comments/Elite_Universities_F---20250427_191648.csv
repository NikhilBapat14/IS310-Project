"Good. Harvard is leading the way against government educational overreach, and other colleges are falling in line with them. Columbia University should have done this from the start but instead bowed to a dictator. We know from the past three months that push back works. Trump doesn't have enough people with brains to win most of these court cases.",Psychicgoat2,2025-04-27T19:29:09,90

"[link without paywall](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/education/elite-universities-form-private-collective-to-resist-trump-administration-95a14ff3?st=FwjacR) - apparently the gift link in OP expired.  Excerpt:  > Leaders of some of the nation’s most prestigious universities have assembled a private collective to counter the Trump administration’s attacks on research funding and academic independence across higher education, according to people familiar with the effort.  > The informal group currently includes about 10 schools, including Ivies and leading private research universities, mostly in blue states. Strategy discussions gained momentum after the administration’s recent list of demands for sweeping cultural change at Harvard, viewed by many universities as an assault on independence.  > The collective, as some are calling it, represents a separate, quiet and potentially more potent effort than recent public resolutions from university-aligned groups.  > The group comprises figures at the highest levels, including individual trustees and presidents. Maintaining close contact, they have discussed red lines they won’t cross in negotiations and have gamed out how to respond to different demands presented by the Trump administration, which has frozen or canceled billions in research funding at schools it says haven’t effectively combated antisemitism on their campuses.",nosotros_road_sodium,2025-04-27T20:26:34,28

They should rescind all of the degrees and licenses that their graduates are using to destroy the country then. Their students and donors are the ones doing all of this. ,Youcantshakeme,2025-04-28T00:15:08,2

"Some Universities like Harvard have so many billions in endowment they can band together to save ongoing research projects and float them until America comes to her senses.  Endowment's a rainy day fund partly, and its cloudy as a motherfucker in America.",National-Reception53,2025-04-28T09:51:26,2
