"Trump is incapable of empathy, sympathy, compassion for anyone's struggles, pain and hopelessness. He has the tools necessary as POTUS to help those in need, but that is not what he is about. Fulfillment to him is other's constant adoration of The Man Known as Trump. That is why he stated, ""I run the Country, I run the World"". Sorta like Scarface - The World is Yours",Pixburghman,2025-05-01T23:26:26,5
Would have never guessed this! Hope everyone who didn’t vote because of this issue and “both sides are the same” is happy.,TDeath21,2025-05-01T23:20:48,27
We told you this would happen and yet still you voted for Trump or sat this one out 🙄,SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-01T23:31:23,12
"But, but... Botox Bondi said Trump saved 258 million lives, which I hate to break the news here, but there are only 331 million US citizens.  I highly doubt 78% of the US  population is using and abusing Fentanyl, and with the people they're killing by killing UNICEF off, they've got to be net negative in the lives department.   https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/05/trump-news-doj-fentanyl-pam-bondi-lives-saved.html",Financial-Special766,2025-05-02T00:34:53,2

"It's genuinely worrying how months after the election, Liberals will still post as if Leftists wanted Trump to win because they felt like Biden and by extension, Harris weren't doing enough to hold Israel accountable for war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. Had they fully committed to doing so, they would've gained more voters. But I was seeing sentiment that their votes weren't needed because they were unreliable. And some Leftists like myself voted for Harris, but that doesn't matter anymore.  And yet, y'all are still choosing to be bitter instead of reflecting on why the Left is being scapegoated despite the Democratic candidate who was part of an incumbent administration failed to outperform a narcissistic low IQ Fascist in voter turnout and lost to him twice in less than a decade. But anytime we see some terrible policy shit being done by this admin in respect to Palestinians, y'all love to pull the ""this is what the Left wanted"" card with pure malice and lack of humility. It's fucking shame and terrible optics for y'all.",RisingBlackStar,2025-05-02T04:31:22,-1
A lot of people here simultaneously believe that  1. Palestine activists not voting Harris was a significant reason for her loss  2. No one cares about Palestine and the Dems shouldn’t change anything about their stance on it   You see how there’s some tension there? ,zvezd0pad,2025-05-02T05:29:07,-1

So why did we lose twice? Reminder that HC won the popular vote. ,oatchick,2025-05-02T05:50:49,3
"Op didn’t say they were giving a one item rundown of why Harris lost.   They were saying that movement will go down in history as the most self-defeating of all time.   Which is, objectively, true.",-Gramsci-,2025-05-02T00:27:38,10

"She’s a career prosecutor, my man. I think she would have let Netanyahu get arrested. I sincerely think she would have recommitted to the UN with the new political capital and it could have been our best chance at signing on with the International Court of Justice. Sure, I’m just making foggy predictions about what could have happened, but I’ll tell you what, I predicted this from Trump to a tee.",Junior_Razzmatazz164,2025-05-02T00:45:41,2
