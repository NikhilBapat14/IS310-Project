"Within weeks of President Trump stepping into office, key health and environmental resources that doctors and farmers rely on started disappearing from federal websites. Trump was also quick to dismantle the US Agency for International Development (USAID), cutting off funding — as well as the flow of data that people around the world use to prevent famine and issue warnings ahead of natural disasters.  “As we all watched the websites being pulled down, as we all watched data disappearing, we were all concerned — because that’s truth. There’s truth in data,” says a former contractor who was granted anonymity to speak freely without fear of repercussions. “Now it’s more easy just to say something and force it as the truth.
