Casually buys property in the poorest zip code to use as an address when applying to college. Prob would have to be locked to graduating highschool,spaceursid,2023-06-29T16:02:52,24
"Tracking zip codes makes sense, but it's too easy to get around. Considering most school districts already based where they assign kids on where they live in the city, which school the kid graduated from would probably make more sense for admissions, than the zip code. That said, legacy and donor admissions has always been larger than race based admissions, so this decision is really bullshit.",HTC864,2023-06-29T16:28:07,13
"So this could still be challenged if you're attempting to just use ""Zip Code"" as a work around for ""race"". If you are weighing zip codes with more asian people less than zip codes with more black people, they can still bring a suit, and under the new ""strict scrutiny"" applied to this, it might be likely to fail.",ProLifePanda,2023-06-30T09:14:06,5
"It makes more sense to judge by school or by income than by zipcodes. But I agree with the spirit of your question, if AA was actually about allowing social mobility then class would be way more important than race. But AA was actually just about letting rich black or latino students into schools even if they had worse test scores than other students, and keeping Asians from being the plurality. Some people think in order to get by in the world, you need to be able to find enough of 'your kind' anywhere you go, and need quotas for that.",Corricon,2023-06-29T18:10:01,-4
How about merit? Crazy idea to place based on ability but it just might work.,DMFC593,2023-06-30T10:07:58,-4
"As I understand it, the finding was that colleges cannot be required to use race as a factor.  If I am mistaken, someone please let me know.",JohnOliverismysexgod,2023-06-30T19:59:50,1
"Substitute family income and wealth to ""equalize"" the student body economically. Provide the ""extra"" slots for the poor by eliminating ""legacy admissions"", but first get rid of the elected Republicans and the Reagan taxscam then restor Revenue Sharing so the colleges can afford to lose those big buck alums.",Olderscout77,2023-07-01T16:03:47,1
That's just gentrification with extra steps,klone_free,2023-06-30T09:28:28,3
"so let's say you are poor but dads a janitor at the private school and his kids go for free OR the kid is dirt poor but gets into the best magnet school in town, should they be lumped in with the rich kids?",tossme68,2023-06-30T12:40:30,3
Don't really have to do that much; just pay someone to use their address.,HTC864,2023-06-29T16:23:22,5
For sure. Say an employer screened out resumes from zip codes that were >X% black. They'd get nailed for racial discrimination in no time flat.,ScaryBuilder9886,2023-07-16T16:12:50,1
Nobody was using quotas for affirmative action in the United States. The use of quotas in Affirmative Action was ruled unconstitutional in 1978.,loselyconscious,2023-06-29T20:41:15,4
"If you can’t afford it, merit will get you nowhere. money ≠ intelligence.",seasuighim,2023-06-30T14:02:42,2
"And how did that work out? Were all the college students in 1920 there because of merit, and everyone else who wanted to go but weren't accepted just not good enough students?",lilbluehair,2023-06-30T14:32:50,1
"But if the income-level of your family is a strong predictor of your grades, is that really merit? The oldest child in a family statistically will do better in school than his younger siblings because he gets more attention as a child. Is that merit?",podcastcritic,2023-06-30T17:50:33,1
"That's good to know, but even if that was the law they were definitely doing quotas, just through 'personality scores' given by people who hadn't even done the student's personal interview.",Corricon,2023-06-29T20:44:18,3
Never ending excuses,DMFC593,2023-07-01T00:17:46,1
"Yes, there is no question that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in this personality score system, the scoring systems itself was ridiculous, but I don't see how these personality scores were really just quotas. The personality scores were used as only one factor in a ""holistic"" method (not to say it was a good method) for admission.   And it actually seems like quotas could have solved this problem if Harvard had guaranteed slots for Asian Americans in proportion to, say, how many applied or the population or something. It wouldn't have mattered",loselyconscious,2023-06-29T20:56:07,2
"I asked a question that you clearly can't answer. Now, I could assume that this is due to lack of merit on your part. Instead, I am going to believe that it is largely due to a lack of educational opportunities that you were born into beyond your control.",podcastcritic,2023-07-01T15:36:45,1
"The problem isn't Harvard saying that asians have bad personalities. It's them denying asians admission even though they score significantly better in every way than a black or latino applicant that gets accepted, because they don't want to have 'too many' asians. But some people consider this a good thing, not a problem.",Corricon,2023-06-29T21:11:25,0
