"> The two posts, which have since been deleted, went up Friday after Phelan ― a wealthy investor, prominent art collector and Trump campaign donor ― visited the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard and USS Arizona Memorial in Hawaii, saying he was “there to honor the thousands of service members and civilians who died at Pearl Harbor on  June 7, 1941.” In another post, the account referred to it as “the fateful day of June 7, 1941.”  > The Japanese military’s attack on Pearl Harbor, which President Franklin Roosevelt famously referred to as “a day that will live in infamy,” happened on Dec. 7, 1941.
