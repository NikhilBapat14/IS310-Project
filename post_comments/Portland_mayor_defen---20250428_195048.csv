Good. I voted for him. We need to stand by our residents. No human is illegal. Fuck ICE. Be kind.,Thewallmachine,2025-04-28T19:59:02,30
Good to see! Today’s executive orders are likely intended by Trump to facilitate his efforts to commandeer local law enforcement to pursue his criminal Administration’s agenda. That’s why it’s crucial State and local elected officials stand up to these unconstitutional intimidation tactics.,tonyt4nv,2025-04-28T19:52:29,16

Thanks Mayor. Fuck ICE - thugs ripping people off the street.,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-28T20:12:52,7
"I just need someone to show me and everyone else where it says that local law enforcement is obligated to enforce federal immigration policy.  Because that's all a ""sanctuary city"" is.  A jurisdiction declining to assist ICE and Border Patro in enforcing immigration policy; something which is entirely within their right.  Any day now.  You fucking shit heads crying about ""criminals"" need to start advocating for rounding up j-walkers for detention if you want to consistent on the law & order side of the argument, because it's the same level offense, and you'd think these people would get something resembling due process before being shipped to a concentration camp for ""Didn't look both ways before crossing the road"" levels of civil infraction.",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-28T22:24:42,4
"NGL boys...Im staring to lose hope...   If things keep going this way, America will be beyond the point of no return by July or August....   Who knows if we'll even still have congress by then....I don't see how this doesn't end violently",Hadrian23,2025-04-28T20:11:08,6
I'm only disappointed to learn that Portland's mayor is not actually Kyle MacLachlan.,Minute-Plantain,2025-04-28T20:23:21,2
We survived a Civil War. Its going to take work but we can get there. Never forget the people who supported this clown though.,thegoodnamesrgone123,2025-04-28T20:23:01,3
"Yeah, my entire family minus my grand parents.   I've cut them off, but IDFK what to do anymore man. Republicans don't care, they call us ""Clowns"" for saying this isn't right. We're being gas-light like domestic abuse victims but there's no recourse....   I am genuinely lost on what can be done...",Hadrian23,2025-04-28T20:27:02,3
"Support your local communities, especially those being targeted. Stay engaged with people you know, and if you don’t know people, go meet some helping those in need, or at protests. Keep up the pressure on politicians/officials that are looking to cave. Stay informed from trusted sources. Avoid doomscrolling and delete any apps that feed you info you didn’t ask for; they want nothing more than for people to give up hope.",meTspysball,2025-04-28T22:31:57,3
