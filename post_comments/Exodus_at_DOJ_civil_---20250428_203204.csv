It‚Äôs understandable but unfortunate because it (intentionally) creates a void that MAGA will easily fill.  Political persecution marches forward.,yrotsihfoedisgnorw,2025-04-28T20:45:01,28
> The resignations come as Dhillon and Attorney General Pam Bondi have made clear the priorities of the division -- which was established in the wake of the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s -- would shift away from priorities like enforcing voting rights laws and cracking down on unconstitutional policing to culture war issues touted by President Trump in his 2024 campaign.,TheAnswerWithinUs,2025-04-28T20:32:35,12
"That's going to solve the DOJ applicant process.   They've had open positons for weeks, ever since Trump took office. Who would want to lie under oath for a criminal nonetheless unless you're being blackmailed for being a criminal yourself?",Financial-Special766,2025-04-28T21:44:29,3
"Are they resigning so they can sue, and clog up the system? Imagine 70% additional lawsuits!",Practical_Ad2688,2025-04-29T00:23:22,1
At first I thought it said the attorneys were deported and it made sense.,grodyjody,2025-04-29T05:56:22,1
"We know what the plan is for black people. Anyone in the prison system and anyone fired from a ""DEI"" position- get them in the ""agricultural sciences"" field. Take over for the fired migrants. Then any person with a great great great grandfather who sharecropped and has a certain genetic profile. No civil rights protections. Take away the vote. Bada bing bada boom. Share content.¬†   Defend and response groups get ready. Seek members under benign nams. Prepare.",NoAir5292,2025-04-29T06:43:50,1
"I personally find it hard to believe that anyone who actually is passionate about law and wants to work in the field will be 100% onboard with this, even if they are maga. I find it hard to believe maga is smart enough to even work in law.   They may be right leaning but I feel there will be a point when even they say no.",TheAnswerWithinUs,2025-04-28T20:51:55,5
"Wow, that's a lot of attorneys leaving DOJ. Wonder why they're all going. Hope they find success elsewhere.",Diligent-Ground2602,2025-04-28T21:05:21,-1
"Actually, I think only DOJ criminal positions are open. The Civil division is still under a hiring freeze. Sadly (appallingly), they‚Äôre trying to reassign other civil division people to pick up the slack for the departures- first in federal programs and now, almost certainly, to do their bidding in ‚ÄúCivil Right.‚Äù Really disgusting stuff.",Competitive_Serve929,2025-04-29T09:42:39,1
This is a country founded by rich white men who wanted to be treated like the gods they felt they were. They were very educated but it didn't stop them from believing they were more human and more deserving than their peers. This sentiment has never left and it is once again gaining strength.,ThebesSacredBand,2025-04-29T05:22:44,3
Probly becuase the DOJ is now just a tool to perpetuate the culture war rather than fix any real issues.,TheAnswerWithinUs,2025-04-28T21:11:02,11
"Also, unlike the other willing participants in this fiasco they don‚Äôt want to see their careers over while the ü§° in charge walks.",rmscomm,2025-04-28T23:36:10,2
