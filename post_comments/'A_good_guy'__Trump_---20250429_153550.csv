I feel like more people would have loyalty to amazon than the white house. I mean they could influence people by showing them the tariff prices. Why back down so easily?,Wobblewobblegobble,2025-04-29T15:39:07,8

Would be great if someone would make a tool that showed what the tariff cost increase is for any given product 🤔,Penjat,2025-04-29T16:16:26,4

So I can see how much sales tax is but seeing the tariff tax for billionaire’s tax cut is “hostile”? Ok…,bassplayerguy,2025-04-29T17:45:39,2

"Hey r/politics, Nikol from USA TODAY here. The Trump-Bezos tariff tiff is over.   Earlier on Apr 29, White House responded harshly to a report that Amazon was planning to display how much more items would cost because of Donald Trump's tariffs, calling it a ""hostile and political act.""  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt asked why the company would change the way it displays prices in response to Trump's tariffs, when it did not take similar action during the Biden administration to reflect cost increases brought on by high inflation.  Within hours, Jeff Bezos' company said the display change would not happen. Trump credited Bezos with the change later, as he departed the White House for a rally in Michigan.  ""Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing,"" he said. ""He's a good guy.""  **Read more:** [**https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/29/trump-bezos-amazon-tariffs-white-house/83343087007/**](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/29/trump-bezos-amazon-tariffs-white-house/83343087007/)",usatoday,2025-04-29T15:36:53,1

"""The problem"" = People knowing *exactly why* the prices of their goods are going up. Tariffs aren't the same thing as inflation, but the administration doesn't want people to know that. Now they can wave their arms and go ""You're paying more because China's charging more!""",Outsiders-Laptop,2025-04-29T15:47:18,2
