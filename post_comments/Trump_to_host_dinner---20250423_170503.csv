"They felt that corruption had spent too long lurking in the shadows, so they’re bringing it out into the light.   Not to stamp it out. They want to show it off.",specqq,2025-04-23T18:01:19,3
"The point of the coin isn't to get money, the point of the coin is to give money to Trump. Trump made over $100 million in fees, plus unknown people (presumably people acting in concert with Trump) ran away with over $20 billion when the rug was pulled. It's open corruption on a massive scale. This is not a shareholder meeting, he's meeting with the people who bribed him, and they all have convenient receipts for how much they gave Trump in the form of their crypto wallets.",questron64,2025-04-23T17:39:49,10

Then this has nothing to do with policy and the Supreme Court ruling. Can't folks sue? This is an illegal and impeachable offense even by Supreme Court standards.,MyNameCannotBeSpoken,2025-04-24T07:31:58,0
