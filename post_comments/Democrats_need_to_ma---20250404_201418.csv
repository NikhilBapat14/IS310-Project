"But not journalism?  How does that work?   There's nothing in the Constitution that says ""Democrats must fix all our problems"".  There's no role for political parties at all.   Unless we reject the Bad Logic of Failed Journalism, this chaos will continue.     Example:  Politicians do not ""run"" cities.  Local politics has no control over banking or the economy.  They don't even control all the taxes and roads.  In many cities, including Los Angeles, *they are legally forbidden from police overnight*.",Apprehensive-Fun4181,2025-04-05T09:33:29,1
