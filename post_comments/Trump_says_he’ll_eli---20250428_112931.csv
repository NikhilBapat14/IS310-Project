">The president said his administration would begin by cutting taxes for people who make less than $200,000 a year.  Yea this plan sounds like it came straight from the Tech Bro Oligarchs. Replace income tax for the working class with a much higher consumption tax and then the rich will say that since we don't pay income tax we aren't 'stakeholders' and shouldn't have any say in how the government is run either.",TheCaptainDamnIt,2025-04-28T11:56:27,22

"Attaching consumption taxes to government budgetary requirements (which is what replacing income taxes with tariffs) is always going to result in disastrous outcomes.  And we have perfect examples in the way that gasoline taxes funding road maintenance has invariably resulted in underfunded road maintenance.  Sure it worked fine when cars got 15 MPG... but as cars became more fuel efficient and drivers started shifting towards hybrids and EVs those revenues were no longer sufficient.  Gasoline taxes had to be increased to make up the difference, but that just encouraged drivers to fuel up in exoburbs where the gas was cheaper... leaving the urban and high-traffic areas with decaying infrastructure.  Now Trump wants to do the same thing to the entirety of the United States.",code_archeologist,2025-04-28T11:48:11,7

The sad thing is that Trump doesn‚Äôt even realize that his goals of raising revenue and bringing manufacturing back are at odds with each other.  Then let‚Äôs talk about individuals making less than $200k not paying taxes.  Under the current system someone making $250k will pay around $55k in federal taxes.  You would be better off having the employer cut your pay to $200k.  This would have the extra benefit of reducing other tax liabilities.,Irwin-M_Fletcher,2025-04-28T15:37:08,1
