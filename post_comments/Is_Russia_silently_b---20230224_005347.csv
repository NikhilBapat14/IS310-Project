"As far as has been made public, there doesn't seem to be solid evidence that China is buying up Russia at the moment. That doesn't mean much, the public evidence for that being the case would be:  1. In Russian or Chinese  2. Probably not public  3. Probably obfuscated in some way  4. Written in accordance with guidelines that are a mystery to most people outside those systems  There's plenty of *speculation* that this is going on and I think it's fairly uncontroversial to indicate that it's highly likely that  Russia's future is going to belong to China barring some huge turn in the war that results in an outcome where Russia ""mea culpa's"" and sanctions get lifted.  Russia has a large quantity of natural resources that China very much wants. China has the economic infrastructure to exploit the natural wealth that's locked away in the Urals eight months out of the year.   And Russia really doesn't have a lot of other options.",HeloRising,2023-03-01T06:06:46,4
