"Thank you Senator Booker for DOING SOMETHING.   Not sure what some of you think the Democrats can actually do in this situation. I hear it on TV and read about it every day ‚ÄòThe Democratic Party is doing nothing to stop Trump‚Äô. Can someone please explain what exactly can they do? They‚Äôve filed umpteen lawsuits, they‚Äôre out protesting and making it clear on TV, in the Senate and in the House how much damage that fucking monster is doing and will continue to do because those cowards of the the GOP will do nothing to stop him. People are out protesting, showing up at Tesla dealerships, in Town Hall meetings voicing their anger over his actions.  The GOP holds ALL the power in Congress and if there are people who disagree with him they‚Äôre deathly afraid to speak out or vote against him and Elon. Murkowski is the only GOP politician who seems to speak out and vote against Trump.   The courts appear to be our only hope in stopping this madness.",DeliciousMinute1966,2025-04-01T05:43:42,15
"Its actually amazing. He was BASED. I've not heard a dem (other than AOC) be so fucking based. He had the ammo and he used it (actually at the time of this post, he continues to because Booker is still going).   I know lots of people have problems with him but he did put in 10 hours today, 10 hours I want every dem to put in everyday, at all hours of the Trump term. Shut down the senate, they can do it. It's possible, especially with colleagues who can pose questions to give the filibusterer time to rest their words.

"I don‚Äôt think they necessarily mean they want Democrats ‚Äúto assassinate him‚Äù. At least that‚Äôs not what I mean. I think when people say that, they mean they want to FEEL like the Democrats are doing something.   And at least for me, what I think that means is they want for Democrats to do a better job controlling the narrative. To get their message out in an easy, concise and clear way for people to digest and then say it over and over and over again. Some nice slogans. And maybe even a few performative gestures. To be proactive, rather than reactive.   Because as (at least) these last 3 elections have shown, a lot of politics is just vibes-based. So people want Democrats to give people good vibes instead of allowing Republicans to plant bad vibes about them and then just going ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm sure when people look at the evidence they‚Äôll come to the right conclusion‚Äù. Because they won‚Äôt. At least not reliably enough.   Democrats are often so worried about ‚Äútelling people what they should think‚Äù, but sometimes you have to do that in politics. It‚Äôs like a research study. You can‚Äôt just give people the raw data and expect them to come to the same conclusions as you. That‚Äôs why you do the analysis and then present your conclusions.
