Well Trump isn't known for his ability to understand that no means no. Wherever it be a whole other country or or a woman.,Araloosa,2025-05-06T23:02:31,18
That's direct threat from the president of the largest army on earth. This is crazy.,Trump_sucks_d,2025-05-06T20:39:12,32
"Let's not leave out that Carney then said ""Never, never, never""",ImSomeRandomRedditor,2025-05-06T22:02:40,30
"This dumbass could've sat there and said 'let's work together to find the best way forward' or something equally as generic, and it would have been a win for him.  But he can't stop himself, like a petulant child.  He's sitting next to the Canadian PM, not thinking about working with him at all, his first thought is a to make a thinly veiled threat on an issue that does nothing to bring the country together.  He's the epitome of an insecure 13 year old bully.  He tried to intimidate today and her failed.  Miserably.  Even if there were a way to make a great trade deal, Trump fucks it up from jump.  He's a failure. In. Every. Way.",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-05-06T23:06:20,10
Carney:  Canada will never be for sale just like the US presidency will never be for sale.  Trump:  Never say never!,Lobster_roll_dinner,2025-05-06T20:57:28,6
"I saw Carney's motorcade go by this afternoon; felt like yelling, “I’m sorry our president is such a dick!” but knew he wouldn't hear me. (Am in D.C.)  I did like how he said something like, “I heard from Canada's owners” and they’re not interested in being a state.",keyjan,2025-05-06T20:59:14,11
"Carney missed the opportunity quietly whisper to him ""And you're a fucking idiot""... Then shake his hand and smile for the camera. At some point this etiquette bullshit is past usefulness with this fascist asshole.",williamgman,2025-05-06T21:09:40,7
"Carney should've said ""Never say never say never"" and watch Trump glitch.",rednap_howell,2025-05-06T21:01:55,4
Crazy to have to tell a country with -86 billion or whatever they can’t buy a country lol,Most_Technology557,2025-05-06T22:27:51,3
It was funny Mark just insulted Trump to his face and he didn't get it.,ShoppingDismal3864,2025-05-07T00:25:30,3

"Mango Mussolini owned himself because Carney said “won’t…ever”  Grandpa probably needs some hard candy, a blanket and to turn on Leave it to Beaver to help him feel better.",masstransience,2025-05-06T22:29:10,1
We all know that trump doesn’t understand the concept of ‘consent’,Prestigious-Fig-7143,2025-05-07T06:00:36,1
Carney did what he needed to and got out of that third-world shithole country.,GrimlockN0Bozo,2025-05-07T08:09:36,1
"Mark Carney did a really good job at impersonating the White House floor mat lmao... and this is the guy that was going to stand up to Trump? ""Please Mr. President, Canada isn't for sale.."" What happened to the tough talk? ""Our relationship with the US is over."" As Trump humiliates you in the Oval Office.",TheEpicWindmill,2025-05-07T10:59:41,-1
More like a college bro flunking all his classes that thinks Canada likes him.,fowlraul,2025-05-06T20:50:26,10
"Emphatically!  But spoke oh so calmly.  I loved it, total solidarity.",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-05-06T23:10:11,9
Fuck yeahs. I’m so fucking jealous.,OldPiano6706,2025-05-07T01:32:42,3
"USA wasn't for sale, Trump just gifted it to the Russians",National_Olive_2846,2025-05-06T21:13:27,11
"Epic.  And the nonchalance in how he said it spoke volumes.  So matter of fact, like saying the sky is blue.   I'm envious of my friends to the north tonight.  They have a leader who effortlessly shut down  a direct threat from another leader as if it and he are nothing.  Canadians should be proud.  With traitor Trump, on the other hand... we get the ramblings of an insecure malignant narcissist showing how he answers questions with the first thought in his mind - because he's incapable of formulating coherent thoughts after that.  The result was yet another humiliation of the U.S. on the global stage.",FloridaGirlNikki,2025-05-06T23:31:16,7

"I work every summer in Canada and I am very proud of your country’s response to our idiot president. Canada is an amazing country, and I am deeply sorry that this monster has the bully pulpit.",Chickabeeinthewind,2025-05-06T23:08:47,3
Yeah grandparents have been holding out on us for too long! No more $5 checks grandma we need Ottawa! Joking of course.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-06T23:52:13,1
Ok I meant trillion but I was way off no matter what. lol sentiment still stands though we can’t even afford the citizens we have now so let’s get some more. Just dumb all the way around!,Most_Technology557,2025-05-07T10:21:22,1
