we (DK) canceled a week's vacation in May in the US. We'll be visiting new places in the EU instead.,svel,2025-04-30T09:34:32,10
"I have friends in Canada who are Pakistani who would come down and stay with us every summer, and now there’s no way in hell they’re coming to America.  I know this is anecdotal, but I bet it’s part of a trend right now too.",AKMarine,2025-04-30T09:32:08,6
"Travel for folks who might end up on the wrong end of culture war bs seems to ve collapsing. Most of the foreign academics headed for a couple of major conferences have switched to virtual presentations, for example.",pile_of_fish,2025-04-30T10:19:22,3

"I have stopped all US travel for my trainees, as has my academic department, the charity I work with has cut all US travel. I will not cross the border on advice from the Canadian Association of University Teachers. So just in my tiny sphere, about $100,000 of US travel cut. furthermore, future conferences scheduled in the US are being moved to Canada, UK or Europe.",RabidGuineaPig007,2025-04-30T10:01:02,5
">Despite some ominous signs, a close look at the data shows that travel to the United States is largely holding up — at least so far.  >Nearly as many foreign travelers have arrived at American airports this year than during the same period last year, according to an analysis by The New York Times of entry data collected from every international airport in the country.  >International arrivals did drop more than 10 percent in March compared with last year, but this was largely because Easter fell unusually late this year, pushing back a popular travel window for European tourists. More recent figures from April show that travel over the holiday looked similar to previous years.  On the other hand:  >Visitors haven’t stopped booking summer vacations in the United States, either, with one major exception.  >Canadians, angered by U.S. tariffs and Trump administration talk of turning their country into a 51st state, really do appear to be boycotting the United States. Ticket sales for travel in summer, a crucial season for the industry, are down 21 percent compared with last year.",Naurgul,2025-04-30T09:26:49,4

"No. With the exception of Canada which will hurt my state, Vermont. European and Asian travel is estimated to be down 2-5 percent, based on an article I read yesterday. That’s not good but not devastating.",Constant-Guidance943,2025-04-30T15:24:47,1
"I'm an American citizen, and I'm nervous to travel.   Immigigration enforcement folks have been given a blank check to do whatever the fuck they want without consequence.    I'm gonna stay waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay the fuck away from them as much as I can.",obligatorythr0waway,2025-04-30T15:11:23,1

It's an anti-intellectual government thta has proven to detain people for arbitrary reasons. Detaining and strip searching two German teen girls have reverberated throughout Europe. Pretty sure Hitler's Nazi's never did that.,RabidGuineaPig007,2025-04-30T11:09:14,1
"Dunno about Ontario commercial rental prices, but I doubt they managed to racked up a $17 million debt in 100 days. Seems like it's an ongoing problem and Trump is the final nail.  >According to the filing in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, as reported on by the CBC on Monday, the 24-hour-a-day store owes up to $17 million in rent. This is despite it being situated at the second-busiest U.S.-Canada crossing and being run by Peace Bridge Duty Free Inc. for over 30 years.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-30T09:42:36,3
"*3 month stay*?  Jesus Christ.    I guess one upside to Trump's insanity is that domestic vacation prices might do down for Americans since foreign demand might start dropping off a cliff, haha.",Specific-Parsnip9001,2025-04-30T16:45:18,0
"This tracks, since I don’t see any drop in prices either for flights or hotels. They seem to be expensive still for July and August. ",Good_Focus2665,2025-04-30T10:47:36,2
Thanks for the post. My take: It’s early days yet. The full effect of very recent events hasn’t yet been felt. We’ll see it in the months to come.,solo954,2025-04-30T13:07:34,2

So you are saying wait till it’s closer to July to book hotels and I might get it cheaper? I might just do that honestly. Otherwise the prices are insane. ,Good_Focus2665,2025-04-30T14:50:44,1
