">Louisiana (32.4), Kentucky (28.3), West Virginia (28.2) and Arkansas (27.4) were among seven states that had more than 25 percent of their population on the Medicaid program, according to the health policy research website KFF.  Over a quarter of these red state populations are on it. IAmazing. These people will suffer tremendously but only because they want to. They will go through tribulations. What an incredible choice.",mymomknowsyourmom,2025-04-29T14:43:41,18
"Paraphrasing here: there was a video circulating during the first term of a town hall hosted by a Republican representative (Arkansas, I believe?) who said his goal was to fight to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The attendees boo him, and several retort that they and their loved ones need the ACA to survive. Someone in the crowd shouts, “Y’all ought to be goin’ after Obamacare instead!” The rep says, “Ma’am, it’s the same thing. The ACA is Obamacare.” The crowd boos him again.  The brainwashing is real, and decades in the making.",ANOKNUSA,2025-04-29T15:18:50,12
