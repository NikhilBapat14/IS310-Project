"This is what happens when a Republican gets elected. Republicans create recessions, Democrats create surpluses. The economy does better with a democratic president in the white house, I can guarantee you the republicans don't want us to think about how we ended up after that great depression that President Obama inherited. Nine million Americans lost their jobs, 5 million lost their homes, 13 trillion dollars in family wealth was wiped out. In comes president Obama facing this crisis and I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for pulling us out of that great big ditch. Three straight years of growth and job creation thanks to democratic economic policies.",Long-Tip-5374,2025-04-27T12:18:30,190

The most important point this article makes is that even if Trump reverses all his tariffs today nobody will trust American again probably for generations. Americans inexplicably voted for Trump twice. Simply the world can’t trust the American electorate to not make suicidal decisions and take down the world with them.,acousticburrito,2025-04-27T20:14:21,17
>Good faith is the beginning of success for nations as well as individuals. Trump’s bad faith and poor choices once ruined only those who made the voluntary personal or corporate decision to do business with him. But no one can choose to sit out Trump’s trade war. The casualties are already accumulating.  It’s maddening that only now the editorial class is somehow coming to the awakening that Congress isn’t coming. No leaders are standing up. We are a system in crisis because so many of our so called leaders have been too risk averse and even now as we need them (especially congressional leadership) to take a stand for Americans they turn their heads and accuse each-other of being the problem.,LuigiTheTweak_eth,2025-04-27T13:21:02,22

I sort of hate articles like this in that i cant disagree yet still feel that our nation had to crack down on these American in name only companies. Legislation got us into this mess and sadly has proven to be powerless to bring our blue collar jobs back cause they are in the pockets of the same companies. Consumer actions are useless when they sell to the world market making boycotts toothless along with strikes. The world supply chains had no reason to change as things have worked out great for them. Trump is a moron but someone had to break these entrenched systems that hurt blue collar Americans.,ceiffhikare,2025-04-27T14:28:59,-8

I strongly dislike this rhetoric because it implies that the rest of the world has only dealt with America in the past because our reputation was sterling up until recently. Some other greedy top dog will rise up and do their own heinous shit and eventually America will end up looking pretty good again. Granted I’ll be dead by then but the idea that the rest of the world has the moral fortitude to never do business with America again — even if Trump is fully repudiated — seems just as naive as thinking that his actions will have no ill effects at all.,JimboAltAlt,2025-04-27T21:01:40,-2

Dems haven't been able to raise the federal minimum wage due to either Republicans or not having enough of a majority of non-conservative Democrats to do it.  But both Obama and Biden had policies to work with state govts to raise the state minimum wage and all blue and purple states either have or are on a path to a $15hr minimum.
