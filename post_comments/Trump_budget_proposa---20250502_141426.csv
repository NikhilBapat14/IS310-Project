That would be right. He probably wants to spend the money on some right wing conspiracy garbage that believes earth is flat and space isn't real instead.,Haileysee,2025-05-02T14:17:19,8
Trump reallocates NASA funds to Space X.,Sublimotion,2025-05-02T14:34:17,5
"The budget is huge, like 7 trillion or something. But a bunch of government departments are being cut. This doesn't make sense. Unless you realize they are just lining their pockets while taking from the country. Nobody should support this.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-02T15:15:41,2

“Well I say there’s somethings we don’t want to know. Important things!”  Ned Flanders,LuvKrahft,2025-05-02T14:24:02,1
Trump wants to impound every dime in the federal budget for his personal spending.,insuproble,2025-05-02T14:38:12,1
"Putting aside how much I hate this administration, good.   The SLS has been a massive waste of money that has ballooned WAY out of budget. NASA never even wanted to make the damn thing.   Trust me I love space advancement as much as the next person but going the SLS route is too expensive and too politically motivated.",EvieParkour,2025-05-02T14:50:55,-2
"Elon benefits if NASAs rocket is cancelled. Oh, and every NASA fund is cut other than human space exploration. Which Elon just totally coincidentially happens to be a fan of.  All part of the grift.",QuantumWire,2025-05-02T14:26:13,12
This is all about saving enough to justify a massive tax break for the rich. Just watch.,Syronxc,2025-05-02T14:24:59,4
Except that for now SLS works... and the plan to pour that money into Starship would both make NASA completely dependent on SpaceX and put the money from something that works into something that doesn't for the same purpose.,IkkeKr,2025-05-02T16:46:43,3
It's not called the Senate Launch System for nothing.,Cdub7791,2025-05-02T15:06:54,2
"I didn't know that but it sadly doesn't surprise me. Everything Donald Trump does is to either benefit himself, Elon Musk or his rich business friends. One of the first things he done when he took office was cut back on aid and gave a big tax cut to rich people.",Haileysee,2025-05-02T14:37:12,2
Sure but that’s a different argument.   I’m just saying the SLS is dogshit and a horrible investment.,EvieParkour,2025-05-02T16:52:43,1
"Yeah... it's one of those things where you think ""I wish I'd done that differently"" but are somewhat past the point where it makes sense to throw it away and start over - because then you'll never get anywhere.",IkkeKr,2025-05-02T17:02:51,2
