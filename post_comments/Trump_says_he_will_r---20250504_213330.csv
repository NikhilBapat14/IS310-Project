"Another way to distract attention from his poor performance. It would be vastly more expensive to open up that old, rotting place than to build a new facility. He'll say anything to get people worried about whether or not he'll do the stupid shit he says.",biaggio,2025-05-04T21:55:36,2

"They keep saying how terrible this fentanyl problem is and how terrible these violent offenders are, but then you hear about them pardoning all of these violent offenders who end up in police-involved shootings or driving down the wrong way of a highway and you also keep hearing about how police departments are using 20 of their officers to go harass drag shows to do compliance checks because they have nothing else more important to be working on!",postsshortcomments,2025-05-04T22:04:49,2

"Think about the cost to rebuild that place.  Having to barge over all the steel, concrete, lumber, piping, windows, doors, roofing, furniture, etc... and all the contractors / workers.  And then the cost to operate.  Boating over all the food, supplies, water, etc...  Oh, and the employees every shift.  I have read it was closed in 1963 because it was 3 times more expensive to operate than similar sized prisons.  Total insanity.",Normal_Attitude_5148,2025-05-04T22:08:55,3
