"The Oklahoma GOP has updated their platform to include opposing funding increases for public schools.      The platform now stands against “any increased state funding” for “government schools.”      It also calls to abolish the state income tax, abolish the minimum wage, and more.  The updated platform also includes support for “day of, in person voting” with “limited exceptions,” meaning no early voting and no mail-in voting.",Conscious-Quarter423,2025-05-06T10:19:30,14

"As an Oklahoman, I am not surprised. They've been pushing charter schools hard and squeezing out public schools as much as they can, while already trying to stifle voting access as much as they can.   Their agenda is control and make people stupid so they're easier to control.   I still can't wrap my head around Bible thumpers supporting a man and an agenda that drips and seethes with evil and the stench of sin.   Then again the Republican answer is to remain silent and act like their acquiescence and capitulation means they have no fault in anything. People really need to beat them over the head with the reminder that they made an oath, and they have to keep it, or get out.",Skowlette,2025-05-06T10:28:16,6
"""banning 5G technology and eliminating mail-in and early voting.""   They are so stupid it genuinely hurts me to read  Trump won Oklahoma by 36.4% and not a single county voted for Harris it was all Red, what are they trying to prevent banning mail in and early voting?? it is one of if not the most republican state and will be for probably the next 100 years  No wonder they are 49th in education",blues111,2025-05-06T10:26:33,5

"“I do believe that Oklahoma is one of these states that has the best election system in the country, probably the very best,” Linch said. “And it is still susceptible to challenges and susceptible to cheating. And so how do you make sure there can’t be cheating? You take away all of the factors that would allow it.”  There's no history of sign of any voter fraud. Oklahoma is already gerrymandered like crazy in favor of Republicans along with other rules that make it harder to vote. He knows the system is already rigged in his favor, he just knows he needs it *more* rigged after this insane Presidency because it might actually sway back blue in the next election.   Also I wish the news would stop mentioning ""the next Presidency"" because every month feels like 4 years of hell and idiocy and we can't wait for the next President to clean to the mess they're making.  We need to stop this insanity now.",Skowlette,2025-05-06T10:38:05,1

They should probably hold off on that no income tax thing and see how Mississippi's no income tax works. My crystal ball says it won't be pretty.,Professional-Can1385,2025-05-06T11:49:07,1
"The Oklahoma Republicans want to abolish public schools and just give parents a voucher for private schools.  I don't know why they think that will work in a state as rural as Oklahoma, but that's the goal.",Wurm42,2025-05-06T11:00:54,3

"Stop this insanity? Anyone remember the catch phrase from Trump's first term ""the Trump Train has no brakes""? Seems like a design flaw to me. There is a big corner coming up and we're barreling down the line towards American derailment. ",neutrino71,2025-05-06T10:44:58,1
