"This pause is crucial. What do you think the real agenda was behind this massive downsizing of particular agencies, and which ones were most in the crosshairs for reasons beyond just shrinking government?",j3nnieberry,2025-05-10T03:40:12,22
I’ll rephrase the headline to better fit this sub.  Trump has a meltdown after Judge *slams* planned downsizing of federal agencies.,matt82swe,2025-05-10T02:54:40,45
"About time the judiciary stepped in. Gutting the federal workforce under the guise of reform isn’t leadership, it’s sabotage. If this is how they “streamline” government, next they’ll be replacing judges with campaign donors.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-10T06:25:46,6
"Exactly how is the judge stopping the administration?   If the administration can ignore the Supreme Court without consequence they can ignore this ruling.   Judges aren’t coming to save us. They’re just people dressed up in a silly robe sitting on a bench. The time to stop trump in the courts was the time Biden and Garland wasted. If the people with guns follow trump instead of the courts there’s nothing the courts can do about it.  And for those of you who haven’t been paying attention, the men with the guns and authority to use them worship assholes like trump who give them permission to cut loose.",Sharticus123,2025-05-10T10:36:28,1
I’ll rephrase the headline to better fit reality.  Judge slightly delays Trump administration's dismantlement of federal agencies,bytemage,2025-05-10T03:23:57,7

"The pause is good, then being forced to bring RIF plans into the light is the real win here.",stopthestupidcman,2025-05-10T11:02:11,1
"NOAA.  Monitors storms and tracking the increased hurricanes,  etc which shows a pattern of global warming.",krisann67,2025-05-10T03:43:28,23
Tomorrow's headline: Judge deported to El Salvador.,FrankTooby,2025-05-10T06:42:57,14
And it'll be from *New Republic* of course. Who needs relevant facts when there's only hyperbole?,addctd2badideas,2025-05-10T08:26:29,6
"It's been a while but wasn't that the idea behind, Project 2025? Which was to eliminate NOAA (or to just shrink it to nothingness) because it shows a pattern of climate change and that the authors didn't like. As with the other Federal Agencies a lot of conservatives have been dreaming of what they call, ""a government so small you can drown it in a bathtub..."" since at least the 1980s (and by conservatives I also am including all self-proclaim libertarians that are just Republican -lite). Oh and they despise the Feds as well and a lot of the voting base doesn't care or thinks it will be a good idea (even if they or their children, etc ..) loses a lot of support. Because they were told, ""government bad"" by conservative media for decades.",randomnighmare,2025-05-10T06:25:34,7
