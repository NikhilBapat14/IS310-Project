"People should just do what they want. If you‚Äôre going to be a committed present parent who puts in your best effort then pop em out til you want to be done. If you‚Äôre going to be an irresponsible pos parent please refrain (although they don‚Äôt and usually end up having the most kids). If you don‚Äôt want any great, skip it and don‚Äôt let anyone shame you over it.  I don‚Äôt look at having or not having kids as inherently political.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-04-29T20:27:07,612
"If you work in the foster system, you'll see that the issue isn't the birth rate. There are so many abandoned children who are left to 9-5 employees to raise them",Lanky_Acanthaceae_34,2025-04-30T03:21:38,109

Stop pretending that the world has infinite resources and jobs. Lower birthrates are good for people living and those born in the future.,Zachmode,2025-04-29T19:34:59,198
"I don't consider myself to be a particularly great parent but I do my best, knowing that we've decided we won't be having another kid.  I don't see a problem with thinking like this, too many people view having kids a bucket list item.  Also it would take a huge amount of money to convince me otherwise. Childcare is expensive, college saving and everything else.",Nate0110,2025-04-30T05:54:42,21

"Another washed up actress who was absolutely smokin in License to Drive, has left it too late to have kids so she has to say it's a good thing women don't want them.

‚ÄúPeople should just do what they want‚Äù is not a conservative view of point. We should strive for prservation of our values which includes having a family.,breakdarulez,2025-04-30T03:58:12,-129

"Id argue it's worst for the people alive now who experience the first effects from reduced birthrates and a declining birthrate since they are likely to end up having to pay out the ass for elder care but the smaller generation will benefit with more jobs and housing being freed up.   However, I think the more likely scenario is that birthrates will swing back up as the smaller generation prospers until there are too many people causing birthrates to drop and then swing back and forth.  The only way we can have a constant relatively high birthrate will be once we figure out space colonization.",s1lentchaos,2025-04-29T23:28:46,27
"And yet, those low birthrates are magically only needed in developed countries. When countries in Africa are pumping out 6-7 kids per woman, it's all fine and dandy, as if resource scarcity is not a thing there.  There's an agenda at play here, and everyone who thinks there isn't is being naive.",MarcVipsaniAgrippa,2025-04-30T04:16:25,22
"The problem is that even if you have this mindset the government will just import more cheap overseas workers which is why culture and quality of life continue to erode.   The elites are more than happy for you to stop having kids as they can import people who will expect and demand less, plus they immediately start working and don't have to go through an expensive schooling system for 20 years before they begin.",Entilen,2025-04-30T08:37:15,2

"The younger generation won't benefit from supporting a bloated elderly population; they will be enslaved in terrible jobs in elder care or face the hard choice of senicide or just letting them suffer. There will be relatively fewer working hands for every month to feed, and more of those mouths will need expensive medical care. The younger generation will be impoverished and will likely continue the cycle of not raising families.",moashforbridgefour,2025-04-30T00:54:31,31

Resources are not infinite üòÇ  Proven oil reserves are enough to last 50 years if we‚Äôre lucky. And it‚Äôs not like any world government is actively encouraging more exploration to find more reserves.  And this is just 1 important resource.  Look at places like California where they‚Äôve failed to build dams and capture more water. That‚Äôs the fruit basket of the world. They can‚Äôt make more food for more people‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt have the water.,Zachmode,2025-04-29T19:55:48,23

"Less resoruces are being used there, yes. And yet those countries are not self-sufficient, and we were looking at the brink of a famine before Ukraine and Russia came to the grain deal.  Their countries already don't support their existing numbers, and yet they reproduce like there is no tomorrow.  Meanwhile, countries like the U.S. where the land actually supports more than its current population are bombarded with anti-natalist propaganda.  We need to start asking question.

"Honestly, it would require an entirely new framework for socioeconomic governance. Capitalistic democracy is inadequate, and communistic autocracy is wholly incompatible. I believe a monarchy founded on Catholic moral principles is the best way to organize a society.  Why?  1. Individual vs Community: Catholic social teaching declares that each individual human being is imbued with an incomparable dignity because we are all made in the image of God, our Creator. It upholds the individual‚Äôs right to private property, and also the community‚Äôs duty to care for the poor, the sick, the widow and the orphan.  2. Principle of Subsidiarity: Catholic social teaching upholds the principle of subsidiarity, that local community ought to be empowered to provide the governance of its citizenry, and only powers or provisions that can‚Äôt be reasonably relegated to the local government must be relegated to a state or federal government.  3. Justice and Natural Law: Catholic social teaching is largely predicated on natural law. Using natural law as a legal and judicial framework would ground society in moral truth that is conducive to human flourishing because it highlights the importance of the basic unity of society: the family. In other words, the culture wars of today would be resolved. No abortion, no divorce. The sanctity of matrimony is upheld. Justice seeks to rehabilitate the criminal, not exploit him through punishment.  The current framework is incompetent and inefficient because it has drifted away from what Western Civilization once was. This is a radical departure from the status quo, but Catholic monarchy was a successful way to organize society for over 1,000 years. It‚Äôs the departure from adherence to Christianity and into the maw of secularism that is to blame for most of the ills plaguing modern society, including poor resource management.",Big_Iron_Cowboy,2025-04-29T21:32:48,-17
