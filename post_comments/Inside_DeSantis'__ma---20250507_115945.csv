"Excerpt from the article  > Casey DeSantis still may run for governor, but people familiar with her thinking say the Hope Florida controversy has been a wake-up call.  > ""She doesn't have the stomach or the temperament for this,"" said one Republican who has discussed a campaign with her.  Meanwhile, Republican Representative Alex Andrade has pledged to continue his investigation into Hope Florida in the next legislative session this fall.  **If you’re from Florida** call your state Representative, whether they’re a Republican or Democrat, and tell them to support Rep. Andrade investigation into Hope Florida! He and other Republicans have an axe to grind with DeSantis so DeSantis’ removal is not hopeless.  You can find your state representative’s contact info [here](https://www.flhouse.gov/FindYourRepresentative)  **For anyone calling** I would recommend first asking the staff that answers if the state representative has a position on Rep. Andrade’s investigation into Hope Florida first.  After they answer the question let them know your thoughts. If they’re a Republican, and you’re up for roleplaying, make sure to emphasize that you support Rep. Andrade’s investigation into Hope Florida because it supports Trump’s efforts to Make America Great Again and it’s exactly what DOGE would do in Florida.",FLTA,2025-05-07T12:00:25,6
