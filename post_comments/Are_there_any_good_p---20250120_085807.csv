Would these be acceptable?  Senate: [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/bills\_acts\_laws.htm](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/bills_acts_laws.htm)      House: [https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22congress%22%3A119%7D](https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22congress%22%3A119%7D)  We're currently in the 119th Congress.,JustASumoGuy,2025-01-23T05:26:01,3
