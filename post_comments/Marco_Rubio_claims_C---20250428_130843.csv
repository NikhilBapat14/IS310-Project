"Marco Rubio claims that the little forest animals emerged from the trees and tell him that they wish to bow down to Trump and make him king of all beasts.

"On the other hand, Canada would bring 40 million people, 40 million voters. It's almost the same population as California's 39m people.     And the other states would get very jealous of this HUGE state, I think Texas would have some trouble with it being so dang big, and Alaska would want to redraw it's borders too.   If we live in backwards world, and Canada actually agreed to it.   I'm thinking it'll get split into at least 5 states, probably close to 9-10.   All of which would have Canadian voters LIVID about the arrangement.   He wants Canada, but he doesn't know what he's inviting. Even if it was a peaceful annexation (good lord, what are we even doing talking about here. Annexing our neighbors and allies is fundamentally wrong) the voters would dramatically shift the US voting base to the relatively far left.  Now it's far more likely to result in Canada fighting with everything they had to stop the US from taking them over, like Ukraine and Russia, resulting in countless lives lost and tens of Trillions in damages.",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-04-28T14:17:13,4
