"The dotard wants to spend a fortune of taxpayer money doing up a dilapidated prison when there’s countless prisons already.  His brain is comprised of hate, racism and bad ideas click bait that end up costing America its reputation, its workers their money  So far this weekend he had and was told to dump the insulting and brain dead idea of renaming Veterans Day 'Victory Day for World One"", wants to reopen a prison only fit to be Clint Eastword's film set at taxpayer expense , posted, along with the WH account, him cosplaying being the Pope and a muscular Sith warrior. While in actuality he's a blob shapped slob who can barely walk up stairs.  All Trump's brain diarrhea  to distract from that he's smashed the economy and so many peoples savings and retirement funds.   But Obama's tan suit, that of course was far worse.  Fox News would have run on any one of this weekend's Trump brain farts for 3 years if it were a Dem Potus.

"It seems inconceivable he was elected but it was an obscene bait and switch plot. He made ridiculous and impossible campaign promises and people fell for it.  All they wanted was a cheaper cart of groceries in an effort to stretch their paychecks. They naively thought Trump would make that happen. Nobody voted for a dictatorship. The entire time since the 2020 election he and his team along with Project 2025 have been paving and fine tuning the road to authoritarianism. Life as we’ve known it is hanging by a spider’s silk.  I too came of age during the Vietnam War and had losses because of it. That is part of the reason I am so deeply opposed to the notion of Trumpism. By the way, Trumps multi millionaire father  bought him a fake draft deferment during Vietnam (bone spurs). But I digress being young during that time meant we had the freedom to protest and pushback without fear of reprisal in a way that’s soon to be lost if the people opposed don’t speak with a united uncompromising voice.",BeneficialTask6328,2025-05-04T21:33:52,1

"That's just splitting hairs. When we say that America elected Donald Trump or the UK voted for Brexit obviously we don't mean every last individual voted that way. But when a country makes a decision it affects the entire country.    And therefore _the country_ deserves whatever the consequences are.        I came of age politically during the Vietnam war. America started a big war in Vietnam and 58,000 Americans were killed.    Did each one of those individuals soldiers deserve to die? In a democratic system of government the question is irrelevant. It is certainly the case that America _as a country_ deserved to suffer for its stupid decision, and the same is true here.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-04T18:55:56,5

Yes. It’s a huge deal for this demographic . Culture bent and morphed around us and I personally reinvented myself several times.  I happily chose things that flipped the norms. It was a wonderful life and the thought of that being ultimately lost for future generations is unbearable.  And of course there’s the little matter of the President not upholding the rule of law and thumbing his nose at the Constitution. I look at those fuckers and sycophants enabling this travesty with disgust and I know I will not go down without complete resistance. We’re going backwards.
