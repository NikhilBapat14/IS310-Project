"He doesn't care.  He never has and never will.  He's not in any threat of serving time in prison anymore so he would be happy even if the country was literally burning to the ground right now.  He is surrounded by sycophants (aka 'traitors') who at their absolute worst lie LIVE on television that a 9-0 Supreme Court loss is a 9-0 Supreme Court win in his favor.  The tech oligarchs conspired to guarantee his election win to keep him out of prison, the Christofascists promise to continually stroke his ego so they can get their Gilead dreams fulfilled, and the rest of us get 100% screwed.  Nothing he has done or will do will be good for any Americans other than billionaires, racists, and sadists.",mhouse2001,2025-04-27T14:23:04,2

"When President Donald Trump stood in the Capitol Rotunda to deliver¬†[his second inauguration address](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/20/trump-inauguration-speech/), he made a series of proclamations and predications as he declared: ‚ÄúA tide of change is sweeping the country.‚Äù  Nearly 100 days after he took the oath, that much has proved unmistakably true.  He has ushered in a dramatic shift far beyond the typical changes that take place every four or eight years, even bigger than Trump himself did in 2017 when he took office the first time. He has altered in fundamental ways how the U.S. economy works, how global diplomacy is conducted, and how immigration is enforced. He is working to tear down and remake the federal bureaucracy, pushing the limits of presidential power, and waging war against the court system.  As he marks his 100th day in office on Wednesday, Trump has a historically low approval rating with signs of erosion on two of his top issues, the¬†[economy¬†](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/04/23/trumps-economic-numbers-turn-dismal/)and immigration. He has overseen a drop in the stock market with few recent precedents, with economists and consumers fearing a rise in inflation and a possible recession.
