"Every single time abortion has been on the ballot since Dobbs, abortion has won. That varies pretty heavily by state--some states have affirmed a constitutional right to abortion, while others have just denied that there isn't a constitutional right to abortion, for example. But in no case has abortion gone to a public ballot and abortion has lost.",mormagils,2023-11-29T12:59:46,5

"No state has used a referendum to limit abortion. From a political standpoint, this would almost certainly be unnecessary since any state where popular support for major restrictions on abortions existed would almost certainly have a legislature willing to enact those restrictions. Indeed, many such states have 'trigger laws' that came into force after Dobbs.  The referendums you see from the pro-life side tend to come in two forms. The first is a Constitutional (state) amendment that would explicitly forbid considering abortion as a right. This is intended to forestall a future judiciary from overturning legislative acts limiting abortion. However, these referendums do not prevent a future legislature from liberalizing abortion laws in those states.  The second tend to deal with parental notification/consent. A plurality of states require parental consent for minor abortions (normally permitting a judge to waive this requirement). Some states require parental notification but not consent. Others require neither parental notification nor consent.",ViskerRatio,2023-11-22T15:07:18,2
"So long as at least one state has legalized abortions and it’s a states-rights issue, you can still get one done safely if you really want or need it no matter what the laws are or become in your state. Then you can put that topic lower down on your priority ticket and go back to wondering how will congress ever fix the growing Federal Deficit before the interest on it grows to consume everything in America? It’s even bigger than the freaking defense budget now. At least there’s some people up there criticizing “spending $80k on a bag of bushings” but not enough yet.",PassionPattern,2024-05-04T03:53:34,1

"Can you point to the Alabama vote? I can't find it through Google. I'm not doubting you, but just curious about what the vote was.",ProLifePanda,2023-12-01T13:18:48,2
