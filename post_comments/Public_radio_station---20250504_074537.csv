"It's no surprise that the Orange Pestilence would target the stations that listeners who want rely on verifiable news would be likely to choose. Now, if those outlets would simply do as they're told and vomit up trump's propaganda, they wouldn't have a problem at all, would they?",phosdick,2025-05-04T07:58:34,7
"One of the coolest public radio stations is KRVS Lafayette/Lake Charles, LA.  They do all kinds of programming to help keep local culture thriving like Cajun and Zydeco shows, promotion of cultural events and programming in English and Cajun French.

"THIS is exactly what they wanted all along! Mission accomplished … because Americans are resourceful and creative. We will always find a way.. the government just said fuck you do it yourself. But eventually, we won’t be able to do it ourselves and we really will be on our own.",lizkbyer,2025-05-04T11:11:45,1
