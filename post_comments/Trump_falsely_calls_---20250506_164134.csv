">At the time, Khelif’s quick victory over Carini exacerbated the online campaign against her, with JK Rowling posting a photo of her after the bout on X, writing: “Could any picture sum up our new men’s rights movement better? The smirk of a male who’s knows he’s protected by a misogynist sporting establishment enjoying the distress of a woman he’s just punched in the head, and whose life’s ambition he’s just shattered.”  >Carini has subsequently said she [would apologise](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/articles/c2j3jg51rg4o) to Khelif for how she acted after the match if she met her again.     Let's be clear: it doesn't matter if Imane Khelif isn't trans. To Trump and Christian nationalists, Khelif is a transgressor of what it means to be a woman, because she isn't some frail and dainty tradwife like they want women to be. That's what all the anti-trans hate is all about. They want to force women back into the kitchen, being barefoot and pregnant. They don't want women to be seen outside the home, because they want wives who ""submit"" to their abuse.",southpawFA,2025-05-06T16:46:43,94

"It’s highly likely someone with a female birth certificate from a Muslim country is a trans woman? Sure, that’s totally logical.   Your assertion that “male sex chromosomes express male biology” is not true either. People with CAIS have XY chromosomes and develop like women because they cannot process testosterone. Check out the pictures on [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome). Do those bodies look like they developed as males? Furthermore, women with CAIS have been allowed to compete since the 1980s because there is absolutely none, zero, nada evidence that having that condition produces any advantage at all.",breezy104,2025-05-07T01:26:09,8

"This is the thing I think.  They don't view a trans person as a person they objectify them instead. Too many times I've heard people say they'd like to be with a trans person. I think the idea of a woman with a dick/futa etc became popular in porn and it just broke a lot of those people's minds when they realised the person they're attracted to at work or in the shop would fit into that ""forbidden"" category",Keirhan,2025-05-07T03:13:49,12

"It is, statistically speaking, highly improbable that she has CAIS, specifically because, as you point out, people with CAIS don’t process testosterone and develop female phenotypic physical traits. Objectively speaking, Imane does not appear to have developed female phenotypic physical traits. If anything, she looks like she is either biologically male or has undergone excessive testosterone hormone replacement therapy. And I’m not referring to her “looks”, I’m speaking about biological traits. Skeletal structure. Anatomical proportions, Muscular development.   So again, absent any evidence from her to the contrary, and in light of a statement that she tested positive for XY male chromosomes, from one of the world’s largest and most established international boxing organizations, who had requested her permission to publish the test results, and considering her phenotypic expression that makes CAIS highly improbable… the evidence supports the logical conclusion that she is likely transgender and for whatever personal reasons (I’m not judging or knocking her decision), she doesn’t want to acknowledge or admit this.",Significant_Emu2286,2025-05-07T22:09:34,1

"Exactly this.  There's never a non-sexual answer to ""why do you want to be with a trans person?""  I think me being trans is like the fifteenth most important thing to know about me.
