Other articles are saying there‚Äôs actually no negotiations between the us and China happening right now. I‚Äôm getting the feeling that may be closer to the truth with all of this,AlexandersWonder,2025-04-26T00:49:31,16

"same. supposedly he has made 200 negotiations since announcing his chart on increased tax on american consumers‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but can‚Äôt name a single country he has negotiated with. most countries have stated they don‚Äôt even know what the administration wants out of any hypothetical negotiations.   so far there have been zero changes made since the last set of tariffs aimed at china, which china literally just ignored.",acidrefluxisgreat,2025-04-26T01:14:42,13
I read an article that said China got tariffs dropped from semiconductor chips which is a huge win for them. It's really the only import they need the U.S. for.,boring_person13,2025-04-26T06:19:34,2
He‚Äôs been a failure at everything in his life. The only reason he‚Äôs president is because he‚Äôs Putin‚Äôs useful idiot. He‚Äôs a puppet. That‚Äôs it. He‚Äôs carrying out all of his plans and a good portion of Americans are also useful idiots.,CheezeLoueez08,2025-04-26T08:49:15,2

The orange turd words were open to interpretation as usual.. He said '200 deals'....this could be with his oligarchy friends or his Russian friends or the penguins but probably not an actual country.,therealvladimir_0,2025-04-26T05:26:54,4
