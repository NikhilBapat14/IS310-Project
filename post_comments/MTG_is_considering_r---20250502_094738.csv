"Here's the thing, even if she's polling poorly, and a Senate race is significantly more difficult as a state-wide race, I am concerned about election integrity. MTG is a bulldog for Trump and someone he sees as a secure placement in GA to help with his aims. I know Kemp probably thinks MTG is much harder to deal with, let alone pressure/control than either Warnock or Ossof, but nonetheless is in the GOP club. It is a fair assumption to suspect the 2026 Midterms are going to be a shtishow, possibly heavily rigged. Her running, regardless of polling, is a risk and I could easily see Trump pushing for election tampering in GA just to secure the state and provide one more member of the Union to be in lockstep with his authoritarian goals.

">Yes but the deadline is September, and the primary is usually in the middle of the year. So when she loses the senate primary, she can just withdraw from the senate race and then file to run for house.  The primaries for the House and Senate seats are on the same day. If she loses the Senate primary, somebody else will have won the House primary.",TheBigLeMattSki,2025-05-02T12:59:12,7

I really have no clue I just remember hearing about it and just knowing she herself is a huge troll. Based on her district though yeah a Dem was not going to win,ATLfalcons27,2025-05-02T11:20:33,2

"I mean, while you‚Äôre totally right about the voting for Trump part, you can‚Äôt use a single representative as a measure of a state‚Äôs overall politics since their races aren‚Äôt statewide. Even the most liberal states in the country have far-right republicans in offices in very rural areas and the most conservative states have liberals in offices in cities. MTG‚Äôs district is obscenely conservative, but if she ran in Atlanta she‚Äôd get less than 0% of the vote. Statewide is iffy for her as well given she can‚Äôt disguise any of her leanings and rhetoric. Let‚Äôs not forget that her bestie Lauren Boebert legitimately had to change districts to an even more conservative one or lose her seat last election cycle.",V_T_H,2025-05-02T10:46:49,17

Would it be insane to have a dark campaign that gives money to her senate campaign such that she artificially polls better and then actually runs and loses her primary and then loses her house seat?? Can we manifest this?,sr41489,2025-05-02T23:30:59,1

"He was just some token Dem running an anonymous campaign but when MTG entered the race it blew up because she was so crazy and was saying such nutty shit in the primary.  So then the national media was watching and all of a sudden this poor guy was in a high profile congressional race with like one part time staffer as his campaign manager and it was too much.    Im sure he did get some nasty phone calls and emails but it's not like people were trying to murder him, he was just in over his head.",dillpickles007,2025-05-02T12:19:54,-7

"Yeah, the area we're talking about is super country and the biggest town outside of the part of Cobb County that got gerrymandered in is probably Dalton? Rome?
