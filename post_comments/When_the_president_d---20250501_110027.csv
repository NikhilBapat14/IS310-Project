Maga businesses are closing at a crazy fast rate because of Trump policies. They aren't allowed to complain. Sad for them but they want to be treated like that.,mymomknowsyourmom,2025-05-01T11:01:46,3
"Well this president made enemies with our allies. Started a trade war. Pushing to give huge tax breaks to the rich while strangling the government benefits that help those in poverty. Sooo. Tourism is down the shitter, merchandise will rise in price or just not be available, people will lose their jobs, and the stock market will tank. All of this is happening because of the current president.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-01T11:34:54,2
The president owns the economy when it’s doing well and doesn’t own it when it’s not.  At least that’s how it’s always worked politically.,jediporcupine,2025-05-01T11:08:13,1
