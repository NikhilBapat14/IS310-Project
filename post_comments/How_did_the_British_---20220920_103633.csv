"Post WWII there was simply no appetite for the fighting that would have been necessary to maintain their empire. Most of their African possessions were rebelling, or on the edge of it, and India was clearly ready to break into full fledged rebellion any day. They were broke, two generations of men had died in the last two world wars, and no one wanted to keep fighting.",LiberalAspergers,2022-09-20T20:51:47,18
"They ran out of money.  Most of the reason to be an empire is to siphon wealth from your possessions.  In the case of the British, they started paying out more to maintain their colonies than they were making.  Getting wrecked in WWII was the icing on that cake.",Blear,2022-09-20T19:52:37,28
"You remember the early parts of WW2 in the Pacific/Asian theater where the Japanese quickly took control of places like French Indochina, Singapore, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and the Dutch East Indies?  Yeah… the locals there remembered watching the “great colonial masters” get chased out, and they realized it wouldn’t be that difficult to get them to leave again. It was the death knell of their credibility in terms of maintaining those colonies through force. Kind of like what’s happening *right now* in some post-Soviet states while watching Russia get pantsed by Ukraine.   Fast forward after WW2, and not only are former colonies working to remove themselves from European colonial power, there’s also a superpower branding itself as the arsenal and supporter of anti-colonialist efforts all over the globe.",GetZePopcorn,2022-09-21T02:14:52,8
">As a Civilization player  u/white_nerdy, This is your problem right here. Civilization is a ***history themed*** abstract tile-based strategy game. It is NOT a grand strategy or historical simulator by any stretch of the imagination. There are few historical lessons to be learned from the gameplay; the biggest benefit is exposing you to specific historical rulers, nations, and technology concepts.  In history, as in every day life, decisions involve tradeoffs. Countries don't simply snowball possessions and then get to hold onto them indefinitely, there are constantly changing internal and external factors that determine every single year whether it's worth keeping an empire or not.   For example, WWII propaganda became a potent driver in anti-colonial movements after the war. It became hypocritical and untenable for Allied nations to talk big about ""freedom"" and the ""self determination of peoples"" with regards to Nazi Germany when they themselves were denying those same freedoms to everyone else in their own colonial empires. This sort of hypocrisy was not out in the open pre-war. Hence an example of how circumstances change.",paceminterris,2022-09-20T23:26:10,11
My guess is that it became too costly to maintain the empire and protect crown control from threats internal and external. Britain was so broke it was still rationing years after WWII.,ArchdukeAlex8,2022-09-20T18:36:40,5
"If there's ONE thing map simulation games haven't really figured out, it's the economic and political cost of subjugating captured peoples. Civ, HOI, Total War, Europa Universalis, Victoria, Crusader Kings, etc, none of them have been successful at accurately portraying the costs of empire and the difficulty of keeping it together when it doesn't want to be. If it was portrayed accurately, those games wouldn't be very fun.  So what you're missing here is that if a people doesn't want to be governed, there is ultimately no government that can hold them together. Sure, it can get increasingly brutal and repressive, but eventually, if even that doesn't subdue a people's interest in self-government, then nothing will keep them together. These are human beings, and at a certain point even the conquerors are faced with an impenetrable human resolve. What are you supposed to do when someone hates you enough to light themselves on fire *as a political statement*? Do you want to keep sending your sons to die in the jungle? Even if they don't die, if they can't make any money, and are stuck away from home for years, wasting away their life doing nothing of value, nothing they can be proud of, why would they keep doing it? There are human things here that video games just don't simulate. Leaders need followers, not just a scenario and resources.  Colonialism was running into issues long before WW2. Many of the most prosperous and politically organized colonies, like the eventual USA, wanted to be ruled by themselves and not by an extractive sovereign oceans away and had already broken away, and the colonies still subjugated were clearly wanting to follow suit. WW1 was probably the latest that this movement was putting great pressure on colonial powers to end their days of empire. Look up Woodrow Wilson's 14 points. In it, the US commits to supporting the self-determination of all peoples, and while they didn't exactly hold to this promise until after WW2, the ground work was being laid.  This was for several reasons. When the European powers create an international system where they create not just one, but TWO devastating world wars in the space of half a century, it's hard to argue for their benevolent leadership. Many of the colonial entities had spent the last few hundred years seeing their wealth plundered and wasted. The colonial powers were also at that point tired of war and subjugation--they had just fought massive wars, and the home countries were mostly rubble, and the last thing that the UK and France wanted to do was wrangle with Angola for stretched-thin resources. Plus there was the ideological argument that for the last two wars Europe and the West had argued again and again that this war effort was about liberating oppressed peoples...while they held colonies.  In short, letting go of the colonies just made sense for everyone. It was too much work to keep them up in the face of mounting criticism and increasingly expensive maintenance costs. This was the case for all the colonial powers.",mormagils,2022-09-21T09:12:25,3
">  A nation takes over a fair portion of the world, fights like lions and even commit atrocities to keep it, wins two world wars, then one day shortly thereafter just.. stops fighting and lets the empire fall apart? That doesn't make much sense.  Well, look at the colonial empires who saw the burgeoning independence and decolonisation movements and decided to fight them.  The French fought brutal, bloody wars in Indochina, in Algeria. And lost. The Portuguese did the same in Africa and India. And lost (in particularly humiliating fashion in Goa). The weight and cost (both moral and actual) of these wars ended up bringing down governments, and the fight to preserve empire never ended in success.   But it's not just a matter of logistics and military might; a great shift in world moral thinking had come about. The self-determination of peoples was believed to be necessary and righteous, and added additional moral and social burdens to the country's that would deny it. Quite a shift from the imperialism indulged in throughout the late 19th century and into the early 20th.  > So for the Commonwealth countries, wouldn't it make sense to remain together?  The Commonwealth essentially *is* the empire, or as much of the empire as the people in those nations wanted to have.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-09-21T19:04:07,3
"Basically, the incentive to push to keep it going went away.   It wasn't as lucrative anymore, and we couldn't afford to entice them to remain and give them any benefits to Empire, so they didn't want to stay. Some of them were getting a tad uppity, with grand ideas of Independence - so after a while they were gently encouraged to bugger off as they so pleased.   The British Army is around 75K men and dropping, we haven't maintained recruitment targets for around 20 years. Recently they decided to lower the personnel targets from 80K to 72K and pretend its all a deliberate downsizing rather than actually admit that not enough people want to join or stay.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-09-20T21:03:04,5
"A lot of the comments are missing that colonialism was never profitable for the nation as a whole. I’m sure some individuals got rich from it, and that’s why it was done but that’s not the same thing. There are studies that show European colonial powers grew slower over the period than non-colonial powers.",Anasynth,2022-09-23T18:44:56,2
"Someone will be able to provide a better and more comprehensive answer, but I think in simple terms the British stopped being ‘imperial’ when they no longer had an empire.   Part of the monarch’s title used to be not just king/queen, but also emperor/empress. Specifically, Queen Victoria was designated as the Empress of India, as were her immediate successors.   Along with naval and trade domination, India as part of a British Empire accounted for a significant part of British prestige and pre-eminence. India (and Pakistan) winning their independence post WWII and the relinquishment of the title of Emperor was another element of Britain’s post war decline.",PreservedKill1ck,2022-09-20T22:40:34,-1
">As a Civilization player the history here is very confusing to me. A nation takes over a fair portion of the world, fights like lions and even commit atrocities to keep it, wins two world wars, then one day shortly thereafter just.. stops fighting and lets the empire fall apart? That doesn't make much sense.  Primary explanation: Britain lost  almost all of its military power during World War II.  Economically, the nation was a basket case at the end of the war.   It also faced a growing worldwide sentiment that imperialism was no longer acceptable, and that nations would chart their own destinies.  Some imperialist nations tried to resist this: the French tried to hang on to Vietnam. That didn't work out for them.",Markdd8,2022-10-01T14:53:30,1
"I wouldn't say we ran out of money, especially as we didn't Dissolve the empire, we simply allowed it to die.  The incentive to keep the Empire went away.  And it was becoming a PR nightmare. We gently encouraged them to bugger off and do their own thing but were largely fine with keeping them if they didn't get too uppity.   The French went a different route with their former empire - They made them part of France. French Guiana in South America is as much part of France and the EU as Paris is.  We didn't do that because we didn't want the dirty foreigns to think they were our equals.  There was actually noise about making Malta, of all places, wholly part of the UK - they held a referendum on it in 1956, but that didn't happen for myriad of reasons, one of which was that we didn't want the rest of the colonies getting any ideas.",NuclearRobotHamster,2022-09-20T20:49:57,7
"Think of Britain as playing really wide. WWII starts, it loses its amenities and gets loyalty bombed by half of the world. It also gets rid of its colonial offices card after the war while other civs keep trying to actively flip British cities on other continents. Almost all of its cities on other continents are in unrest and become free cities in a matter of a few turns, and since Britain doesn’t have the units, money, or production to take them back, they let the free cities stay independent.",Butiamnotausername,2022-09-21T05:59:15,6
Allowed it to die is a bit rich. Several colonies rebelled or were going to rebel. Just look up the Kenyan Mau Mau rebellion. The U.K. didn’t have the resources to maintain their colonies. Same with the Dutch or the French.,TheByzantineEmpire,2022-09-20T23:13:55,19
