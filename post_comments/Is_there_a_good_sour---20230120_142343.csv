"""The House"" by Robert Remini is like a biography of the chamber.  I haven't personally read it, but I bet ""Master of the Senate,"" the Robert Caro LBJ biography, is chock full of those details.  ""The Congressional Experience"" by David Price is more academic, and he was serving in Congress when he wrote it.",digbyforever,2023-01-20T18:32:13,11
"Not quite as thorough as you’re looking for, but Jeff Jackson, a freshman member from North Carolina, has been documenting what his day-to-day life has been like since being elected on various social media platforms and some of the details are pretty interesting!",sweaterkarat,2023-01-20T18:37:02,10
There was a great book I read for a college course and the name of it escapes me. This is a placeholder comment while I climb into the attic and blow the dust off my box of old junk…  Edit: Congress: The Electoral Connection by David R. Mayhew  That book/course made me want to run for elected office one day. The past six years made me not want to do that anymore.,kbeks,2023-01-20T20:56:24,5

It sounds like a lot of what you want is in the procedural rules of Congress itself,Blear,2023-01-20T17:49:09,1
"IMHO you want Mayhew’s *The Electoral Connection*. It’s not a day-to-day mechanics of what congress does, but it’s the seminal work in understanding *How congress actually works*. What are the constraints and incentives faced by your lawmakers? Who seeks re-election and why? What can actually get done and what can’t?   If you could only read one book about congress, it should be this one.",[deleted],2023-02-02T21:38:13,1
I'm sure you could find that insight on Youtube. Maybe not a video that covers it all but at least by subject. PBS has several that rea digs deep you can also find on YouTube. Probably profitable if it was turned into a reality show. Lol,Bei_kween,2023-02-02T23:26:14,1
"Can second the Robert Caro. All his LBJ books, for that matter.   Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote a mountain of material but you’d probably have to sift through all of it to get to what you’re looking for.",knockatize,2023-01-21T06:33:36,3
That sounds somewhat what I'm looking for. I'll just have to slowly get a better picture.,TylerJWhit,2023-01-20T18:40:37,2
Feels pretty accurate LOL,TylerJWhit,2023-01-20T21:08:45,3
"Seconding this recommendation, it's the ""one weird trick to understanding your Congressman"" of political science.  Not 100% true all the time, because nothing is, but explains a huge amount of Congressional behavior.",digbyforever,2023-01-21T10:24:32,2
Partly. It's mainly that I'd want to know the daily tasks and a thousand ft overview of in session procedure.,TylerJWhit,2023-01-20T18:35:36,2
"/u/JeffJacksonNC  I follow him, so I see his updates. I'm not in his district, but I absolutely appreciate the play by play. I hope he continues to post them, good bad and ugly.",smedley89,2023-01-27T09:21:29,1
