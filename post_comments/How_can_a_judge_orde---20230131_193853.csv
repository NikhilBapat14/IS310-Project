"It is not illegal to strike. However, it may be *unlawful*.  The distinction is that if a strike is lawful, workers have certain protections. Most notably that their jobs will be waiting for them when the strike is over. If a strike is unlawful, their employer can simply fire them and hire replacements.  In Massachusetts (and some other states), public sector employees are not allowed to strike. If you walk off your job, you're not 'striking'. You're just quitting without notice. If you encourage others to collectively walk of the job, you can be fired for that conduct even if you remained at your post.  So basically what the judge is saying is that if they want to quit their jobs, they can. But if they want to continue working for the Commonwealth, they need to show up to work.",ViskerRatio,2023-02-01T17:09:54,15
"The whole ""judge can end a strike"" thing is already somewhat left of what a more reasonable position would be. It would be more reasonable to ban public sector unions. Public sector employees should use the political process to get what they want, rather than unionizing. Unionizing is inherently for private sector because in that case it is one private group against another private group, but doing the same thing in the public sector makes it those employees (e.g. teachers) against the public/taxpayers.",tsme-esr,2023-02-12T00:12:44,1
