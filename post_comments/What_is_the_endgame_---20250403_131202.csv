"Its the opposite. Tariffs will hurt and possibly shut down a lot of manufacturing in the US because they target raw material that US factories need to put those guys to work.   If you want to help manufacturing, you SUBSIDIZE raw material and tariff finished products. A blanket tariff is just chaos.      Remember Trump is also deporting a lot of low cost workers which also hurts manufacturing.   AND on top of all that, tariffs will bring inflation which will reduce the demand for finished products.",brooklynite1,2025-04-03T14:03:28,26
"They will if you break the economy, create massive financial insecurity, crater the job market, and destroy education so people don't go getting any fancy notions of equality... yes, once we are a third world country run by techno-dweebies, it will be easier to get Americans to work for starvation wages.  Edit: who will buy all the American made goods is another matter entirely. His policies stifle trade, and most Americans would be too poor to really consume much past basic needs.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-03T13:42:42,14
The sudden way Trump did it (and the sudden way it can be undone) is a huge disincentive to anyone dropping large amounts of capital on a new plant.  Lutnik has a bachelor's in econ and that's it.  He spent time at a hedge fund with monopoly money.  We are looking at an economic rip tide here--the longer we swim in it the worse things will get.,TreeLooksFamiliar22,2025-04-03T13:59:19,8
"When most people think of a factory, they think of an assembly line, with workers installing parts on products.  New factories don't have workers installing parts.  They have robots.  The only workers in a modern factory are the mechanics and electricians who install and repair the robots.  And the engineers who plan the whole thing, of course.",Natoochtoniket,2025-04-03T14:46:55,7

We don't even have the population to staff all the factories Trump thinks will just magically appear in 6 months to replace imported goods.  We're talking millions of workers that don't exist.,Ianthin1,2025-04-03T13:33:23,4
"The jobs that will be brought back here won’t be manual labor. We have automation for that. It will be to work on robots who do the work.   For example, there is a factory in SC that makes towels for hotels. Marriott is a huge buyer. It’s 100% automated, the stitching, washing, packaging.   For the endgame, who knows. Hold on to your wallets. I’m also not sure if we even have enough people to do the work. We are already at full employment by almost any modern standard.",Brilliant_Castle,2025-04-03T17:01:08,4
"the Far Right wants to institute some kind of slave labor/guest worker program to import minions from the 3rd world to toil in the fields & factories without minimum wage or labor law protections. They literally want to yank America back to the 1800's because they wistfully yearn for the Golden Age of slavery, indentured servitude, factory squalor, slums & shacks. It's revolting & immoral.",wip30ut,2025-04-03T15:46:10,3
"That's not really what I'm worried about. Yes, I'm sure US wages would raise the price of many manufacturered goods. I'm fine paying more if it means people get fair compensation.  I'm worried about Tarrifs disproportionately hitting the poor because it's a sales tax. Any gains in Tarrifs should go to tax breaks for low earners.  I'm worried companies won't increase domestic manufacturing and just pay the tax. Raising prices without being domestic manufacturing jobs back.  I'm worried about our export industries crashing due to counter Tarrifs and the rising costs of imported natural resources.  I'm worried about housing costs rising and US manufacturing decling because we can't import the resources we need like Canadian trees, oil, aluminum, ores, etc.  I'm worried about our tech industry suffering (of which we have a trade surplus) because foreign countries now don't want to use US tech  I'm worried about US companies becoming less competitive because they don't have to compete with foreign companies. I'm sure American car companies can make a reliable car like Toyota. They just need to make a better car.  Not that Trump seems to be doing them sensibly. He just puts them in, takes them out, threatens to put them in. If he actually wanted to set economic policy he'd just put them in and leave them there. And he'd target countries with low wages and anti competitive practices. Not Canada and the EU.  I don't want Democrats to be framed only in opposition to Trump's stupid policies. I don't think we should be the anti Tarrifs party. If people want Tarrifs that's fine, but do them sensibly.",davidellis23,2025-04-03T16:18:41,2

The endgame is there is no endgame.    We have a pretty amazing manufacturing sector as it is. It's just more diverse and demands less headcount vs yesteryear.    The people with their hand up the President's rear pushing these things don't understand how any of this work.  Literally none of it.   Any uptick in manufacturing will also feature the latest tech used for said manufacturing which means....more low head count outfits.    The regular people out there who find hope in these actions think that we can just wave a magic wand and it's the 1920's again where you needed 10 thousand people to go to work in a single operating site.  Those days are dead and gone for the most part.    There's ways to bolster even more manufacturing in the US than we already do.  Nobody within 10 miles of this administration knows anything about that.,socialcommentary2000,2025-04-03T15:05:53,1

"I read an interesting story today that discussed auto makers creating new factories in the states. The reality is that they would employ much more automation into new factories in order to offset the costs of hiring physical labor. This means much less work for auto workers than they believe. Automakers make cars but also make money, which is ultimately what motivates all their decisions.",j-Rev63,2025-04-03T19:24:02,1
The endgame is for him to point to tariffs and the revenue they bring in as justification for his mega tax cuts to rich people. The same reason he's cutting the federal government to the bone. He's going to point to the tariff revenue and government cost cutting and say it pays for the tax cuts. And even though they won't come close to covering the tax cuts it's enough for his cult members to continue to pull the wool over their own eyes and accept it.,EndlessLeo,2025-04-03T19:30:18,1

"> The people with their hand up the President’s rear pushing these things don’t understand how any of this work.   I think they do. I think the issue is we keep on assuming they’re trying to build something great and functional. If we instead assume the goal is literally the weakening and destruction of not only the USA, but the global economy as a whole, then things actually start to make sense.
