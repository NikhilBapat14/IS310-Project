"Most newer constitutions deal with issues analagous to the major problems in the US constitution around more representative government.   Examples include more proportional representation, weakening or abolishing upper houses of government like the US senate, elections for Supreme Court Judges, recall elections for most or all offices, and limitations upon the power of the executive.",Kronzypantz,2025-05-07T08:03:47,31
"If we had a roundtable where reps from each country sat around and shared what works best for them in each country, and if we could simply take the best from each place, the world would be far better off.  Unfortunately, this is hard to do if you happen yo live in a country that considers itself the best in the world despite glaring g flaws and massive social problems.",CaspinLange,2025-05-07T15:25:10,9
"Here are some sections of the Finnish constitution from the year 2000:  Section 16 - Educational rights Everyone has the right to basic education free of charge. Provisions on the duty to receive education are laid down by an Act. The public authorities shall, as provided in more detail by an Act, gu arantee for everyone equal opportunity to receive other educational services in accordance with their ability and special needs, as well as the opportunity to develop themselves without being prevented by economic hardship. The freedom of science, the arts and higher education is guaranteed.   Section 20 - Responsibility for the environment Nature and its biodiversity, the environment and the national heritage are the responsibility of everyo ne. The public authorities shall endeavour to guarantee for everyone the right to a healthy environment and for everyone the possibility to influence the decisions that concern their own living environment.",VilleKivinen,2025-05-09T18:31:14,4

"The Constitution is an amazing document, so strangely ahead of its time, but its one major flaw is that it never accounted for someone as insidiously corrupt and ill intended as the current president.   The corruption and grift we're seeing now is at a level never even imagined, with the billions being siphoned off with his crypto scheme alone. It's not only a grift, but a national security disaster, as any foreign leader can just purchase Trump's meme coin, and get policy favored in return, as Abu Dhabi just did. Many argue this is why Trump is so pro-Russian, with god knows how much might have been funneled into the Trump crypto coins from Putin.   Most modern constitutions have much more specific anti-corruption laws in place and that is the area we really need reform on, if there's a country left after this term.",JohnSpartan2025,2025-05-09T16:04:12,2
"Everyone is put into office inside of 2 weeks.  House would be 1 Representative per county with a minimum population of 50k. Another rep is added every 50k. I'd do away with the senate. No house leader. No voting. Laws are done by petition. Once a rep is ok with a bill, they pass it around to all other reps and get signitures. If they edit something, signatures reset.  The president needs to be given 1 judge to assign per year, regardless if someone dies or not. The judges, not the senate, confirm the selection. Again, no house leader bs and things wok by petition.  Executive gets split in two. One for homeland execution, the other for external policy. They have separate budgets. Veto is based on who executes the law.  Do away with the electoral college.  Federal standardization of voting protocols to a ranked approval system. If your approval drops below 50% you are recalled. Checked every 2 months and population is required by law to participate.  Constitutional protection of right FROM religion, protection of gender identity, and fluidity.",zayelion,2025-05-07T10:19:15,1

"While we should always be open to change and challenge our own beliefs I don't believe that's our current problem.  Our single biggest problem is the basic American doesn't know/understand what the constitution says and equally important, what are the historical events that led to the constitution",ConsitutionalHistory,2025-05-08T12:29:15,1
"The main thing we can learn is that institutions can be easily manipulated by the wealthy and powerful to serve themselves at the expense of everyone else. An ancient document that handcuffs any significant change to the status quo plays precisely into this strategy, and therefore we should understand the wealth class would interpret an upgrade as a threat to how they do business with our government and our tax dollars.",-ReadingBug-,2025-05-10T17:18:32,1

"Britain had the South Seas Bubble about 50 years before the revolution, it wouldn't be so crazy to imagine that corruption would be an issue of this sort. Just that schemes and laws became ever more complicated.",Awesomeuser90,2025-05-09T17:50:15,1
Just what country is this system of representatives based on? I can't think of any constitution where this model was ever used.,Awesomeuser90,2025-05-07T13:27:00,3

"I think that they are still valuable. For example, in Kenya, they have a set of tribunals which make reports about misconduct and medical incapacity for certain kinds of officials which could be very useful to lessen the problems you might see with impeachment, presidents otherwise easily firing important officers, and the 25th amendment issues.",Awesomeuser90,2025-05-07T13:46:20,2

The double executive is roman. The judicial is a note from the Vatican. The representative one is from older US functionality. They locked the expansion eventually as they started to have difficulty getting all the people in the building and functions became unwieldy. The result was lack of representation.,zayelion,2025-05-07T13:37:27,4
Reports of misconduct are made.  Nothing stays hidden forever.  Medical capacity is a grey area and a slippery slope.,JKlerk,2025-05-07T15:43:39,3
