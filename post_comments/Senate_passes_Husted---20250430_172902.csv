Senate Republicans want appliances in the US to consume more energy.   That should satisfy GOP campaign contributors from power utility companies.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-30T17:29:38,58
"Sure hope no foreign parts are being used to manufacture these appliances. Otherwise, whatever savings come out of this anti conservation stance will go up in smoke and then some.",kompletist,2025-04-30T18:04:21,24
This will save zero dollars. The cost of appliances won't go down because of this. This a political cash grab from utility companies.,Tall_Preference_5590,2025-04-30T19:34:54,15
It's just hippie punching. They don't even mean for anyone to gain anything from this.,The_B_Wolf,2025-04-30T19:06:26,8

"That’ll bring down grocery costs, or is it help secure the border? Oh wait, this surely will stop those pesky Canadians from their fentanyl funnel! Surely whatever it, I’m sure we’ll be great again after this.",Loveroffinerthings,2025-04-30T19:16:20,3
"As badly as Trump sucks, I'd pay *extra* for a dishwasher that allowed me to have a clean-water rinse between the pre-wash & main wash, and one or more additional clean-water rinses at the end, like my old (early-2000s) dishwasher used to.  Modern dishwashers fsck'ing **SUCK.**   With old, ""water-wasting"" dishwashers, you could load them up with dishes full of crusty cat food & not have your glassware come out smelling like tuna.  With old dishwashers, you could put a glass baking dish with carbonized, rock-hard lasagna on the top rack, hit ""power wash"" + extra rinse + temp boost, and know with confidence that 99.8% of the time, it would come out spotless. Now, that same dish requires 2 or 3 runs to achieve the same result.  This is not a hill for Democrats to die on. Plenty of **Democrats** hate the compromised-performance of ""energy-efficient"" appliances, too. And honestly, allowing people to add a few more rinses STILL uses less energy than running a cycle to completion, noticing they aren't perfectly clean, screaming ""Damn it!"", and running another full cleaning cycle on the same load.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-05-01T11:08:25,1

Dems need to say:  >*MAGA won't be running things forever. When we return we'll reinstate the energy savings standards and maybe even add a few. So don't waste a lot on retooling and redesign now because you'll have to undo it all sooner than you think.*,clamorous_owle,2025-04-30T20:07:38,6
"And that’s why most companies are going to stop selling in the US altogether. They don’t want to deal with the constant fluctuations. If we don’t clean house and get our shit together, we’re going to get seriously left behind by every other country.",DNSGeek,2025-04-30T20:48:19,3
