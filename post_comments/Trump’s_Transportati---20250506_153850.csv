> Duffy claimed that former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Biden were too focused on “celebrating equity and the green new deal” than fixing the U.S. air traffic control system.       And Transportation Secretary “Real World/Road Rules Challenge” spends all of his time bringing up his issues with the previous administration instead of actually doing the job he was confirmed by the Senate to do.,heismanwinner82,2025-05-06T15:51:28,14
"This is the result when you vote in and nominate unqualified reality tv stars like Trump, Duffy, and Hegseth.   You get airports that don't work, an economy in shambles, and general chaos.   All of this points to a society's rapid decline.",Ozymandias12,2025-05-06T16:16:22,6

"This is just like that time on Real World/Road Rules challenge where he drank too much Zima and pooed himself. Strange that he seems so incompetent running this agency given his experience on the Real Workd/Road Rules challenge.   (We are, truly, living in an Idiocracy sequel. The difference with the sequel is it’s a dark and deeply disturbing drama. Not a comedy. But all other main concepts from the first film remain the same).",-Gramsci-,2025-05-06T16:58:37,5

We shouldn't have former lobbyists/Fox News hosts OR small town mayors in such crucial positions. Promote from within the DOT with people who know what the hell is going on. People's lives are on the line,longtermattention,2025-05-06T15:54:40,3

And these issues didn't happen under Biden/Buttigieg's leadership.   This is a direct result of Republicans for years underfunding the FAA and causing chaos in the government that slowed down hiring processes.,Ozymandias12,2025-05-06T16:20:45,9

"It has been but it’s been acutely exacerbated by Trump and republicans. In 2017 trump and republicans shut down the government right in the middle of the FAA trying to implement a plan to increase hiring. The shutdown led to the FAA missing its hiring targets every single year of the Trump admin and [staffing reached an all time low under his presidency.](https://imgur.com/a/y1MpGnX) And to put a finer point on it, [the shutdown ended when airports shut down because of low staffing in towers](https://www.Ann.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown?cid=ios_app)  Then Biden became president and his administration [exceeded their hiring targets every single year he was president](https://imgur.com/a/1ibyc4V) and staffing increased every year. Now all of a sudden, Trump comes back and DOGE starts furlowing government workers, including ATCs and lo and behold, there’s a crisis again and plans are crashing.",Ozymandias12,2025-05-06T18:05:45,4
The FAA was missing hiring targets so badly that they began fairly heavy recruiting/marketing on Reddit,elevendirtyasses,2025-05-06T18:48:31,1
