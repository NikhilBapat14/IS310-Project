"I fucking swear, every time I thought Trump couldn't act any dumber, more ridiculous, or with more conspicuous impunity, he manages to outshine himself yet again.  If Signalgate was an ""honest accident"", Trump should not be talking to that journalist anywhere other than in court. His actions can't be read as anything else than a *conspicuous and intentional* spit in the face of the law, ethics, decorum, and common sense. A loud and clear signal he considers himself and his henchmen above the law and answerable to nobody except himself.  ""Yes, we leaked the chat. Maybe it was an accident. Maybe it wasn't. It's not for you plebs to judge, anyways. We are doing whatever we see fit, leak anything we want, say anything we want, and decide solely by ourselves whether or not our actions are proper. Whatcha gonna do about it, peasants?""",GeneReddit123,2025-04-24T21:44:15,21
"“The president added that he was informed it will be part of a longer story titled, “The Most Consequential President of this Century.”  Trump is not only a con artist he’s a Grade A Easy Mark.",lifeat24fps,2025-04-24T22:23:46,9
He says a lot of things that aren't based in reality. Can't trust anything he says until it actually happens.,RealGianath,2025-04-24T21:46:13,5
"Original TruthSocial post:  >Later today I will be meeting with, of all people, Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor of The Atlantic, and the person responsible for many fictional stories about me, including the made-up HOAX on “Suckers and Losers” and, SignalGate, something he was somewhat more “successful” with.   >Jeffrey is bringing with him Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker, not exactly pro-Trump writers, either, to put it mildly! The story they are writing, they have told my representatives, will be entitled, “The Most Consequential President of this Century.”   >I am doing this interview out of curiosity, and as a competition with myself, just to see if it’s possible for The Atlantic to be “truthful.” Are they capable of writing a fair story on “TRUMP”? The way I look at it, what can be so bad – I WON!  Link won't feed him traffic to TruthSocial:  https://trumpstruth.org/statuses/30764",nerphurp,2025-04-24T21:48:17,6
