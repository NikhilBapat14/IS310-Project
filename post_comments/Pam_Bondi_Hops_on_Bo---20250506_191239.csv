"Has nobody in MAGA ever been to Alcatraz? All it would take is a quick look around to understand how dumb and unworkable this idea is.  I get the average MAGA is terrified to set foot in a city like San Francisco. And I get the average MAGA wouldn’t want to tour a historical site, when they could use their vacation days to do something awesome like a monster truck rally instead.  But you think at least some of them would know better than to say this dumb shit.",AlphaNewsNetwork,2025-05-06T19:29:50,57

The cost per prisoner on Alcatraz was 3x that of a mainland prison.   Thankfully Doggy has saved us like three hundred dollars which we can go towards the billions it would take to get Alcatraz back into functioning condition with things like... running water.,mmccxi,2025-05-06T19:16:55,14
"Alcatraz is a great place to visit when you’re in San Francisco. It’s definitely worth the price of admission. That said, I can’t even imagine the price tag for refurbishing, retrofitting, and upgrading the entire building to bring it to code for a modern day prison.

Have any of them ever been to see Alcatraz? I seriously doubt it. They must think that it's in good condition and all that's needed is a little splash of paint.

"Yeah but he saw a movie about it and it looked like a cool plan.   Once housed the most dangerous criminals? The Hopi 19, the group of native men who refused to send their children to boarding school were sent there for a whole year. Frank Bolt, a navy man, was sent there because he was gay. Was given the title of inmate #1 by the president at the time just so everyone would know how much our country hated gay people. Okay, Al Capone and whoever else were sent there too but he needs to stop. It was closed because it was too expensive to run and that was before plumbing or anyone giving a shit about fair treatment of prisoners. It’s impossible.
