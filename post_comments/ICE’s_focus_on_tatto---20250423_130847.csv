Ironically all of the ICE people have tattoos.,TintedApostle,2025-04-23T13:29:31,13
"Ironically, the Signal chat scandals might not have happened if White Supremacist tattoos were still taboo.",spiritfiend,2025-04-23T13:12:56,12
"At the anti-trump protest this past Saturday, I met a guy who told me that he's lived in multiple Central and South American countries in his past. He said that there are some people in neighborhoods where gangs are prominent who get gang tattoos because it's not safe to walk through those neighborhoods without them. You might get attacked by a gang member who thinks you're not one of them. So those people weren't actually part of a gang, but they got the tattoos because they were trying to protect themselves. This is one of many reasons it's not fair to jump to conclusions about someone just because of their tattoos!",sachiprecious,2025-04-23T13:18:23,4
I guarantee anyone with a blue line flag tattoo is a gang member of an extremely violent gang.,Exotic-Debt-8706,2025-04-23T16:56:21,2

"Trump lies about the amount of illegals, ICE fails to reach inflated goals based on fake numbers, ICE needs to invent reasons to deport people so their numbers will reach their fake goals.  Snowballing idiocy.",Zealousideal_Bad_922,2025-04-23T15:09:43,1
Somebody should ask ol' Whiskeyleaks Hegseth about *his* tattoos.,SpeedySpooley,2025-04-23T15:14:43,1
If you have a limited budget it’s probably best to go after the ones who brand themselves ,MarlinMaverick,2025-04-23T16:00:46,0
"Because wait for it... they are in a gang.  And no, just because a person has a tat doesn't mean they are in a gang.",tech57,2025-04-23T14:07:49,9
"> And no, just because a person has a tat doesn't mean they are in a gang.  Correct.....as someone with a shamrock on his inner wrist.  The amount of times I've been asked if it was a white supremacist tattoo....is not zero.  When the actual truth is....I'm just a  Plastic Paddy American who likes to indulge his Irish ancestry.  And shamrocks are cool. It's that simple.",SpeedySpooley,2025-04-23T15:13:35,2
I remember one time a doctor was checking me out. He swore up and down that I was military and he did not believe that I have zero tattoos or piercings.    I like tattoos and I'm happy they are mainstream now I just never wanted to get one.,tech57,2025-04-24T07:48:06,1
