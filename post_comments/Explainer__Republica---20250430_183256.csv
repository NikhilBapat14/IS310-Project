They are cutting as much as they can to defend the 4.5 trillion tax break they want to give to the rich. How about just giving a 3.5 trillion tax break and save medicaid.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-30T19:12:15,6
Our fat assed cosplaying Meal Team Six members love to announce that when you go after their guns... It's war. Wait till they lose their Medicare. It'll be like pulling the plug on life support for them. Folks might be surprised how they flip.,williamgman,2025-04-30T19:20:47,4
