"It looks a lot less like an endorsement if you think about it in terms of accommodating free expression of religion (which is also in the 1A).  It's not a ""national holiday"" but rather a day that the federal government, as an employer, is closed for business. If you're going to lose a critical mass of your workforce due to most of them taking annual leave to observe a holiday, perhaps it's easier to simply close for business than run on a skeleton crew.   I grew up in a public school district that was Jewish enough that we were off for Yom Kippur, for example. No point in having class if half the kids aren't there for it.",[deleted],2022-12-25T22:53:02,80
">and I am not really interested in the argument that it is not, it just is  I really don't know what quality of discourse you're expecting if you're limiting a very arguable premise from the get go.   Most secular countries practice some degree of accommodationism for logistics alone. If the majority of the workforce is taking time off, you might as well make it a national holiday. And as I mentioned, you really can't ignore that the fact it's become a fairly commercialised and secular event, *and* part of the US monoculture *and* the fact it's a essentially a part of the holiday season*.*",TScottFitzgerald,2022-12-26T07:58:10,8
"I really had no idea, so I did some research. Early Christians chose the time around Saturnalia that it woukd be more easily embraced. I found that Christmas in the Middle Ages was church followed by drunken partying. There was a Halloween-like thing where the rich should invite commoners into their homes or be terrorized.  Puritans hated Christmas and it was banned during the English Civil War and then restored after the insurgents were ousted. So that led up to a bunch of American colonists with different ideas about Christmas that coalesced into the idea that it should be celebrated more as a family day than drunkenly.  https://www.history.com/topics/christmas/history-of-christmas   But there was no official holiday until 1870. Who was president in1870? Grant. It doesn't say so, but my interpretation is that this is a post-war period where congress is looking for feel-good legislation they can all agree upon. Lincoln had just made Thanksgiving a holiday, so Christmas came next.  https://thereconstructionera.com/in-1870-ulysses-s-grant-made-christmas-a-national-holiday/  TLDR: Christmas started religious but went through several iterations and meanings. My guess is that the US was so Christian in 1870 that no one even thought about the religious aspect, and it would appear that it was meant to be more family-focused than about church.",[deleted],2022-12-26T00:38:17,9
"The argument is that Christmas is as much a cultural holiday as a religious one. If you look around the globe, Christmas is also celebrated by non-Christians and even nonbelievers. As for the Lemon Test, the secular test is satisfied because Christmas isn’t an exclusively Christian holiday. As for the second prong, the simple act of having Christmas as a holiday wouldn’t necessarily advance or inhibit religious practices of any kind. Basically, all a federal holiday is is a day when the mail doesn’t come",SpartanNation053,2022-12-26T01:35:21,8
Christmas is more of a corpartw holiday now anyway. An excuse to got and spend sometimes thousands of dollars  on presents. Most people I know don't even celebrate the whole Cristian aspect.,RandomPerson082,2022-12-26T09:43:07,2

"Correct. There is an element of pragmatism in the law here. The point is that laws are made to reflect social needs, not entirely ignore them. As long as the government isn't religious about it, there's nothing wrong with dovetailing federal holidays with actual holidays celebrated by most of your population.",mormagils,2023-01-03T09:03:07,2
">really had no idea, so I did some research. Early Christians chose the time around Saturnalia that it woukd be more easily embraced.   Incorrect- the timing was more the result of the Romans.       Saturnalia was originally a harvest festival held in early autumn; as your article says: Saturn was the God of agriculture and the Festival was more like Halloween.       It started out a short holiday, but grew longer overtime and began to be held later and later in the year.  As mentioned in this post, many religious followers taking off work for their different holidays, isn't good for the economy.       So, a Roman Emperor decreed that religious festivals had to be held around the winter solstice.  Many Christians did participate in those Saturnalia holidays because there was no 'Christmas' yet, and Saturnalia was an 'opposite day' kind of party, so acting like pagans was to be expected.       Still some Christians thought that since other faiths had festivals at that time; Christianity should have some kind of element to it, too.      So, the church leaders decided that if the congregations wanted to; they could hold a 'Christ's mass' honoring Jesus' birthday, even if it was known that he wasn't born on Dec. 25th.       This is why many branches of Christianity, don't hold a holiday per se, but just schedule a worship service somewhere between Dec. 25th and Jan. 6th., some don't consider it a Holy Day.",loCAtek,2022-12-26T04:51:51,4

"> It’s literally four words on a coin.  I can use the same reasoning in reverse - if it's four words on a coin, why are you throwing a fit over it? And I really doubt you'd be ok with any four words. Would you mind if it said ""In Allah we trust?""  Also - it's actually not just four words on a coin as I've already explained. It was made the *official motto* of the US.  > If you can stand to hear about God, you picked the wrong country to live in.
