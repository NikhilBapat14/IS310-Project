"the quotes looked canned or planted. ""I would love to look into \[REAL ID\] more."" what? ""love"" to look into it more? it's a fookin government id.",h0stetler,2025-05-02T08:12:19,9
Cost is an excuse not to get Real ID? How can someone afford a plane ticket but not spend $40-$50 on the ID? Sounds like a cop out.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-02T07:04:09,18
You are in dire straits if you can’t afford this after knowing about it for years.,bw2082,2025-05-02T07:51:12,8
Do we need proof of who we are just to fly domestic?  they've already searched us,TooHotTea,2025-05-02T07:07:21,14

"I got one the last time I got my DL renewed, for 8 years I believe.  It expires next year. I’ve had it that long.   I don’t think (at the time) it cost any more than a regular 8 year DL.   My husband did not do it on his last renewal, and he only got a 4 year.   My kids don’t have them, of course - so yeah, I guess I’d put the $$ towards a passport, we should have them, but it’s expensive and kid’s passports expire sooner (and the price is lower, but not that much lower).",existingfish,2025-05-02T22:23:48,1
The government wants only US citizens or passport holders on domestic flights. I see it as being similar to now needing a passport to travel to Canada or Mexico.,social_dinosaur,2025-05-02T07:11:52,-9
"Well I have to admit I don’t have one myself but have the passport, passport card, and global entry. My license expires next year so I saw no need to renew it now.",bw2082,2025-05-02T09:46:52,2
Yep exactly.  I guess I'll fly with a passport until I decide thats too much headache or my current license expires in November.  If I didn't have a passport I would have already done it.,Hawaiian_Pizza459,2025-05-02T11:32:53,1
