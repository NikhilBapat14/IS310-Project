"Just last week, Trump took aim at one of the overzealous, unconstitutional rules issued by Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB). This Trump action signals the beginning of a broader dismantling of Biden-era rules that the prior administration used as a bogus excuse to blame the fallout of Bidenflation on so-called “junk fees.”  Now, Trump flips that script.  He dispels the fiction that fees, not fiscal policy, caused inflation.  Walking back these Biden-era blunders isn’t just good policy — it’s a clear sign that the era of government gaslighting is over.  But Trump isn’t just undoing Biden’s misguided policies. He is also actually bringing down inflation.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-28T12:17:35,-3
