How refreshing to have someone take responsibility instead of always passing the buck...,Cheetotiki,2025-05-08T12:00:26,11
"The party put a lot of pressure on Joe to step aside after the debate.  We live in a world that Joe, Nancy, Chuck and a whole bunch of others helped create.  I appreciate him taking responsibility, but he isn't alone, not by a long shot.",deltadal,2025-05-08T12:20:27,7
"Respect to Biden for actually owning this, unlike the criminal piece of shit we have leading this regime. I'm opposed to his neoliberalism and support of arming Israel but this guy was a *way* better leader overall and you can tell that this grates Trump. He doesn't shut the fuck up about Biden.   How sad that even something as basic as this is what passes for ""good"" news these days.",JimmyRamone17_,2025-05-08T12:07:12,12
"Americans need to blame themselves and their fellow Americans, not Biden or Harris.  It's not their fault that being a half-decent human who didn't vote to burn the country to the ground was apparently just *too haaaaaaaarrrrd* for so many in the ""home of the brave.""",Logical_Hare,2025-05-08T12:12:17,10
"He's not wrong. Had he stuck to what he led us to believe, that he was only going to be a one term president and would serve as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, I don't think we would be where we are now",Angedelanuit97,2025-05-08T12:05:05,11
"Silly Biden thought that even with cognitive decline, he was still more coherent and intelligent than Trump.  He was absolutely right, but he didn't realise MAGA just vote for the one who most indulged their xenophobia.",xwsrx,2025-05-08T12:54:56,2

"This is what we need to start bridging the divide. Honesty.  Republicans cannot combat reality when they’re presented with it. At this moment in time the democrats simply have to eat it and be humble. Acknowledge where they went wrong, don’t point fingers and have an honest plan for the future. Just be real, it’s not that hard.",hmr0987,2025-05-08T12:39:53,1

"This makes me sad Trump and Musk cheated in so many way, Is there a reddit for it ? The lies on X for example one. Germany is prosecuting Musk and also for tweaking alorithms. But A-OK in USA",Kappa351,2025-05-08T14:11:53,1
"By Jesus Mesa — Politics Reporter |  In his first U.S. television interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden on Thursday acknowledged he bears some responsibility for Donald Trump's return to the White House.  ""I do, because, look, I was in charge and he won. So, you know, I take responsibility,"" Biden said during a joint appearance with former First Lady Jill Biden on ABC's The View.  Biden's comments signal a shift in tone as Democrats reckon with Trump's historic comeback. Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election after Biden bowed out late in the campaign, making him the first president since Grover Cleveland to win non-consecutive terms.

"Scratching head...so...if it wasn't for Biden, we wouldn't have Trump?  If I was a MAGA, I might disagree.",thomas_michaud,2025-05-08T12:21:58,0
"No, i'm going to blame biden. He failed to uphold his duty and his oath to the constitution when he let trump off the hook for the coup attempt. If it weren't for Biden's decision to do so, trump would be sitting in a jail cell and not in the whitehouse. ",Bakedads,2025-05-08T12:34:21,4
"He didn't even have to do that. All he had to do was hold trump accountable for the coup, which he had all the authority to do, but instead he let trump and his republican accomplices off the hook. Biden deserves zero praise given how much damage his inaction has caused. ",Bakedads,2025-05-08T12:33:12,10
Joe Biden owns Trump’s win—to be honest did not have that on my bingo card though I agree with him.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-08T12:11:22,-1

Just out of curiosity...why do you think that?  Kamala wouldve become President.  She MIGHT have done a slightly better job with more time... But a LOT of people were against her from the start   And some 77 million STILL would've voted for Trump.,thomas_michaud,2025-05-08T13:44:40,1
"If there was a primary, it's possible kamala wouldn't have been the candidate, and at the very least, the gop wouldn't have been able to hit the dems over the head with the ""you didn't even have a primary"" cudgel that probably caused quite a few people to not vote",xicor,2025-05-08T13:49:38,2
Not quite. Democrats decided on Kamala back in 2020. The country decided the Democrats were right in 2024.,sisterofpythia,2025-05-08T14:01:09,1
Certainly there should have been a Democratic primary. Joe can be thanked for there not being on. But it would have been a sticky situation had Kamala been bypassed.,sisterofpythia,2025-05-08T14:02:55,1
"Well...step back to what you said ... Biden should've stepped down.   If Biden steps down, Kamala would've been President.  That the way it works.  That doesn't mean Kamala would've won a primary to be the candidate....but she would had one hell of a lead.  Now...should Biden have announced he wasn't running for a 2nd term?  Probably. Then we would've had a primary and it goes from there....but even as VP she would have one hell of a lead.    Besides not having a primary....anything in particular you disliked about her policies?   Asking because I really don't care what Republicans think....they were going to be against any Democrat regardless of reason.",thomas_michaud,2025-05-08T14:07:03,1
Chuckle....those who refused to vote for Kamala on principle or out of spite effectively voted for Trump.    Enjoy,thomas_michaud,2025-05-08T14:24:50,1
"I didn't say Biden step down during his presidency, I meant step down instead of trying to run for a second term. He refused to allow a primary.  As for kamala, I don't like her policy just like I don't like biden's policy. I want someone who is willing to make actual change rather than just be status quo. I want universal Healthcare, and I want greed controls on companies. These are thinga establishment dems like Biden and kamala would never do.",xicor,2025-05-08T14:09:59,2
