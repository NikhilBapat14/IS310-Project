The biggest take away is the kids' father straight told people to stop making it a racial issue. He does not want any of this. The video of Lang berating the father is absolutely horrible.   Stop harassing the families of victims for political points. The same shit happened with Laken Riley- her family explicitly did not want her name on the bill. This is absolutely hideous at this point,whichwitch9,2025-04-25T08:13:47,81

"The tragic murder of Austin Metcalf, a Texas teen, has become a focal point for some MAGA media outlets, drawing attention for reasons that many see as exploitative and divisive. Rather than focusing on the grief of the local community, certain media channels have used the case to stoke racial tensions and amplify polarized narratives. This has sparked outrage, with critics accusing these outlets of using Metcalf's death to push their own agendas, rather than allowing the community to heal and find justice in a way that respects all individuals involved. The situation has become a powerful example of how media can sometimes tear communities apart, prioritizing sensationalism over sensitivity in the face of tragedy.",Complete-Buy-8174,2025-04-25T05:20:39,-17

And you may be sick of it, but then maybe people should not come at every situation with an absolute when it is clearly not. Terms like “All” and “Only” imply certain absolutes.

"MAGA pundits are going after the victims family in public for not being racist enough, and deriding the victims father in crude ways.

"She’s not defending Anthony or backing his self defence claim though, is she? It’s not an article exonerating the murderer, it’s an article about how a murder is being used and warped by racists to promote a race war, regardless of the facts or the victims family.   That Anthony was immediately regretful and stupidly unaware of the severity of his actions doesn’t have anything to do with a self-defence claim, but it does undermine the fantasy he was a hardened brute out for white blood. The majority of  murderers are stupid boys getting riled up over stupid things, and this was, sadly, a pretty standard murder. The reason she brings up the self-defence claim is that Texas’ stand-your-ground laws, although largely implemented as a way to defend disproportionate racist violence, are Anthony’s only hope of a defence. That’s because they exist to justify over the top violent reactions to perceived threat, such as black kids walking through your neighbourhood. I doubt they will work for Anthony. ",HauntedHovel,2025-04-25T07:46:54,19

It didn’t happen and it’s not going to happen. It happens in the comment sections and on YouTube, and a quick search of Karmelo in Reddit should prove my point. The right creates media outlets like Fox and Daily Wire. Despite the right’s claim about liberal media, the left typically doesn’t do that. It’s more grass roots, less corporate. So saying the main stream media is only showing one side is a disingenuous argument.  I’m sure this response will be downvoted into oblivion as well, which honestly is fine.

Moreover, I doubt we'd see even a fraction of the ill-advised reactions from anon commenters on the left if the MAGA thought leaders hadn't made this a culture war issue. The reason some on the left take it too far is they're seeing all this racist stuff on the right, they start to get angry, and they lose control. It's not justified, but it's also not surprising. MAGA media is meant to provoke reactions while turning off brains. It's not a surprise that its tactics work on people on the left, as well. MAGA media is provoking them. They are provoked.

"It is not everyone, and the 2 sides are not equal. I will agree that the commenters are generally the most extreme on each side and that the right has much more of them. I think we can both agree on the above.  Where I am confused is the lawyer. He appears to be trying to stir the right into a frenzy and I don’t know why. He called himself an activist minister and runs an activist organization. I had never heard of the guy before, so I don’t know his history. I don’t know if he is doing this as a distraction, or is actively trying to rile up the right for sympathy, or if this directly ties into his activism. The one thing I do know if that the guy is not reducing it being about race. Kicking the other guy’s dad out of the press conference and going on a rant about it did not helping his cause either.  Not that the right won’t rile themselves up on these issues, but they are not doing it alone this time. Besides Charlie Kirk is a moronic douchebag as is anyone at the daily wire. Those guys are so stupid about everything and if you give them corners like the lawyer is, they’re going to tear at it.

Ok, what about all the social media comments -Not a media outlet doesn’t count.  And as I said, pretending like it’s only one group is disingenuous. Maybe the right is making a bigger deal out of it. I don’t really watch any of the right wing media, so I can’t tell you if it’s done more there.  So did I get proven wrong and stomp my feet? No, I just backed away from a discussion where people were going to disregard anything that didn’t fit their pre conceived notions.   Look, everybody had their preconceived ideas, myself included. I will not say that I don’t do it too. If someone starts talking about woke or DEI, I typically shut down what they’re saying as those terms are specifically meant to invalidate a discussion based on a non existent moral high ground.  Had the poster stated than 80% of it was coming from the right, sure, I probably wouldn’t have though much of it.

If that is your argument, then I will concede, as that is not what I was trying to comment on.  In all fairness though, the left media was never going to cover it. They were always going to be very dry and to the point. If the claimed bullying is proven, that is when I suspect we will see it more in left media.
