"No, they voted to uphold their principals.  The MAGAs can do whatever they want with that fact.  The title sounds stupid.  Imagine a 1940's headline, ""Catholic church comes out against gassing the Jews to annoy the Nazis.""  Could it be that they are simply against gassing people for any reason?

"How arrogant to believe that the Catholic Church is making a decision purely to spite Donald Trump. I think they chose who they wanted to choose, and the fringe benefit of him being the opposite of what Maga is looking for is gravy.

"He’s literally a centrist. He’s firmly against female priests, and he pushed back on blessing same-sex couples and takes a strong stance against abortion. He is the definition of pro-life. He just thinks it’s cruel to send poor migrants to prison without trial. They’re mad cause he refuses to get behind throwing out basic human decency. I mean honestly, the south and Central Americans in CECOT are a vast majority Catholics. What the fuck do you think he’s gonna say?

"Donald Trump likely only has 20 years at best left on this planet. The Catholic Church is 2000 years old and seeking to plan and protect its future in this world. Trump is barely a blip in that timeline.  I believe the conclave voted on its principles. They chose a leader much in line with Francis, which makes sense given that many of them were selected by Francis to be in their roles. The church also needs a leader who is truly informed and educated on doctrine, the gospels and orthodoxy. Any pope selected for a focus solely on the political issues of the moment would be incredibly shortsighted and damaging to the church and I’d like to believe that was not in play here.
