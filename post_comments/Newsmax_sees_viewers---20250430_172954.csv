"The mainstream has been raking the chalkboard into a stack of megaphones every minute of every day for the past 10 years, it leaves people looking for an alternative.  Or even just a place to just not hear the chalkboard rake for a few minutes. Conservative streamers miss big on this when they think we need to be reminded what the chalkboard said today. (Hint: there is never a single occasion when we *ever once* miss it, because there's people we didn't ask for following us around with it *already,* but even if we did somehow avoid it on any given day ***that does not mean*** we're looking for somebody to fill us in.)",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-30T18:00:43,5
