Of course they are.  To them it's all about messaging rather than actually governing with any real prudence.  It's why they lie so much about everything.,OldSchoolBubba,2025-04-27T16:12:43,8

"I still don't think most understand it beyond something doesn't feel right; it's an unease and growing attention to little things in their personal life.
