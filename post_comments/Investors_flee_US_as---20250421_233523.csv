"This one simple idea explains most of the problems of capitalism. Those who own sufficient capital don't actually need to be good at what they do and often have little incentive to be.  An additional issue is that being rich *insulates* you from the consequences of your own mistakes or ignorance. You can keep thinking you're good at what you do while making less money than you would have made if you had just let someone else run your companies / investments / ..., because you still made a profit or simply because you are still rich. And even as you attack and denounce the support structures of the society you became or remained rich in, you're unlikely to feel the effects personally because, in a crisis that someone else will have to fix and pay for, you have a buffer by virtue of which you end up ahead of everyone else who doesn't have that luxury.  This is exacerbated by the fact that they have placed themselves, to a varying extent, above and beyond the law. There are no legal consequences for them when they do things that would land normal people in jail. They commit fraud, break regulations and rules, harm people, kill people, ..., but it doesn't matter because they can hide behind a corporation that isn't really punished for what they do through it. And if there are no consequences for lesser crimes, the lesson they will learn from this is that there are no consequences for anything.  This is very similar to what happens in the political sphere. Decadent aristocracies, mad dictators, idiotic kings, ..., bringing down their own system because the very fact of sitting at the center of it deprives you of the the knowledge and the incentive to improve or even maintain it. This similarity is most visible with the oligarchs you see today because they are the most extreme example of this. They're not really part of society any more, so they no longer care about the institutions that support it. Instead, they focus on either forcing society to conform to their own mad power fantasies or on creating their own isolated fiefdoms where they can do the same on a smaller scale.
