"> “It was worth it because we got to continue centering what was happening in Gaza,” said Layla Elabed, the cofounder of Uncommitted, which declined to endorse Harris and encouraged people to vote their conscience. Asked if she feels any guilt about Trump’s win, Elabed said that what frustrates her is that their months of activism ultimately “wasn’t enough to save lives.”  Are they seriously this delusional?

There are some that absolutely believe this.

No one is claiming Harris would have single-handedly solved the issue overnight, but she was one of the only mainstream federal politicians to be openly pro-Palestinian independence.

They agree on a *lot* of things with the GOP, especially the Christian nationalists. They might disagree on theology but policy is in near lockstep.   2.

If your chosen political position is far leftist, you’re not really going to agree with either major party in any way and are blinded to the major differences between the two.  3. Antisocial weirdos who just hate incumbents.

">the states purpose   Judaism, being an ethnoreligion, can blur the lines. That said, it’s pretty damn obvious the entire idea was to give a home to ethnic Jews post-Holocaust and post-Pogroms that they will forever be “safe” in. David Ben-Gurion himself, the founder of Israel said this as much.   To be clear, Ben-Gurion was a Zionist, not a Kahanist. That came later. He wished for peace with Arabs (note, he never said Muslims, this was a geopolitical and ethnic issue), despite believing peace was going to be very difficult after the Jews had been expelled from Baghdad, Cairo, and Damascus. Israel was never supposed to be a country solely of Jews, but rather a home for Jews, among others. Kahanism and the later Kach parties grew out of extremist movements after independence.  I’m not defending Israel’s actions as it’s pretty clear Kahanism has become the Likud’s ideology (hell, Itamar Ben-Gvir is a Kahanist himself, lifelong) but Ben-Gurion himself took a more nuanced stance than “God promised us this land”.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-05T12:34:27,0

lol that’s an awful lot of loaded claims for knowing absolutely nothing about me.   But I do have a question. Are you glad Trump got in over Kamala?,Easy-Preparation-667,2025-05-05T13:27:51,8
"They are down voting because they don't like being confronted with the reality that the majority of Americans in 2025 have been gaslit into believing that Palestine has ""no claim to land"" despite the founding of the Israeli state directly stating that Israel will be carved out of Palestine, not the other way around as they are currently doing.  Because every American politician manufactures consent for this revisionist history in order to keep a nuclear ally in the middle east theatre.  Its always been about religious wars and religious powers.",Hot_Ambition_6457,2025-05-06T09:56:53,3

">she did the opposite    Bullshit. [Harris was one of the *only* federal politicians to support Palestinian independence](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/23/g-s1-19232/kamala-harris-israel-gaza-dnc). This is exactly what I mean. When you are so far left, you don’t see the differences between the parties or personnel.   If you can’t see how Harris and Biden are different on the topic, and how they differ from Trump, I can’t help you.",EnvironmentalEye4537,2025-05-05T14:13:40,8

No? But I have absolutely 0 reason to think she would've pressured Israel any more than Biden did. Biden is the reason Trump was elected.,Revlar,2025-05-05T14:10:23,3
