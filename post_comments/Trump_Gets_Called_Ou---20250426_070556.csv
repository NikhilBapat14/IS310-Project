"Trump Gets Called Out in Front of Millions at Pope’s Funeral Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re used the homily to criticize the president, who was seated in the front row to hear it.  The posthumous criticism came after Trump was mobbed by a group of world leaders, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral.  The pressure from European leaders appeared to pay off after Trump sat down briefly with Zelensky before the funeral, and then the White House announced that he would meet with him again afterwards.  Macron, Starmer and Zelensky talk to Trump Ukraine President's office However, it was Trump’s signature first-term policy of building a border wall that appeared to draw papal ire in the funeral eulogy. The policy was much criticized by Francis during his lifetime, and Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who delivered the homily, ensured that the late Pope’s hostility to the policy was not forgotten.  Re said: “Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions ... ‘Build bridges, not walls,’ was an exhortation he repeated many times.”  Members of the clergy gather, ahead of the funeral Mass of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 26, 2025. Members of the clergy gather, ahead of the funeral Mass of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 26, 2025. Dylan Martinez/Reuters Trump and Francis had clashed repeatedly over the years, beginning in early 2016, when Francis criticized Trump’s plan to build a border wall, saying that anyone who thought only of building walls and not bridges “is not Christian.”  Trump responded angrily, calling it “disgraceful” for a religious leader to question his faith and accusing Mexico of manipulating the Pope. The bitter and very public exchange saw Trump label Francis as “a very political person.”  The homily may only have been an implicit rebuke, but after such a public clash over building walls, there can be no mistake that it was a deliberate and pointed one from the Vatican in front of millions watching around the world.

Kai Pfaffenbach/Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters Trump and the Pope had a cordial meeting in 2017 despite the public barbs that had been thrown, but tensions simmered beneath the surface. Francis continued to speak out against Trump’s policies, condemning his withdrawal from climate agreements and his rhetoric on immigration. Trump and his supporters, in turn, painted Francis as a political operator meddling beyond his spiritual role.  On Trump’s return to office, their feud exploded back into public view after Francis denounced Trump’s plans for mass deportations as “a disgrace,” accusing him of punishing the vulnerable.  Trump’s allies hit back, mocking the Pope’s criticisms by pointing to the high, secure walls around Vatican City.  Trump’s decision to travel to Europe, thrusting himself into the heart of the continent’s biggest diplomatic jamboree, exposed him to intense lobbying from European leaders who violently disagree with what they see as his appeasement of Russia.  Nonetheless, his meeting with Zelensky raised hopes that a breakthrough in a peace deal on the Russia-Ukraine war could be imminent a day after Trump said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” on ending the war.  Zelensky’s office posted photographs of the two men sitting on a pair of chairs in St. Peter’s Basilica.  “We discussed a lot one-on-one. Hoping for results on everything we covered,” Zelensky tweeted. “Protecting the lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.”  Hope surged further after the White House said the two men are due to meet again before Trump departs",Choice_Cup_3624,2025-04-26T07:48:42,5231

You know,  he's the most popular leader in the world,  probably the best leader the world has ever seen.    I would would have loved to be a fly on the wall in Air Force One on the way home to hear what he thought about criticisms of the wall in the eulogy. Never mind.

"From chatgpt after telling it this news, and asking if The Vatican has walls, and if it's hypocritical of The Pope to say this, here the answer: ""You're not wrong to notice the irony. The Vatican literally has huge walls around it — and has had them for centuries. Some of those walls were built after Rome got sacked (like in 846 A.D. when Arab raiders looted Old St. Peter’s), and they were expanded during the Renaissance to protect the Pope. Today, you can't just waltz into Vatican City. There's tight Swiss Guard security, police checks, and restricted zones. It's definitely a ""rules for thee, not for me"" vibe when leaders preach open borders while living behind gates, guards, and walls.  And you’re right — Pope Francis saying that at Trump (especially so publicly) while presiding over one of the most fortified mini-countries on Earth is pretty hypocritical if you step back and look at it objectively.  Want me to pull up some examples of what their actual security and entry rules are? It's even more strict than a U.S. airport.""

"Did… did his fans think Pope Francis built the wall?

I don’t support religion of any kind and believe it’s nonsense but still have read the Bible multiple times and especially in the book of Matthew, recognize the ethical and empathetic humanist principles. He practiced what he preached in that aspect. It’s weird how his fan base wouldn’t self reflect after multiple religious leaders called on him to protect the vulnerable and help those in need only or have some humanity with that horrifying family separation practice- only to be met with the same distain he directs at judges, journalists, “rhinos”, allied nations, nonpartisan federal employees, Bishop curry after he violently cleared protesters, conference of Catholic bishops, National conference of churches, interfaith alliance, poor people’s campaign, Christian blasey ford, EJ Carrol, prosecutors especially when their women of color, military generals that didn’t let him drone Mexico or deploy the military against American citizens, and members of the political opposition especially Illhan Omar, AOC, Ayana Pressley, and Rashida Talib (the whole “go back” to where you came from… they’re US citizens) and Rabbis and the ADL after Charlottesville.

Benedict XVI and Francis both used (at)pontifex as their official Twitter/X handles.

"Trump Gets Called Out in Front of Millions at Pope’s Funeral Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re used the homily to criticize the president, who was seated in the front row to hear it.  The posthumous criticism came after Trump was mobbed by a group of world leaders, including France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral.  The pressure from European leaders appeared to pay off after Trump sat down briefly with Zelensky before the funeral, and then the White House announced that he would meet with him again afterwards.  Macron, Starmer and Zelensky talk to Trump Ukraine President's office However, it was Trump’s signature first-term policy of building a border wall that appeared to draw papal ire in the funeral eulogy. The policy was much criticized by Francis during his lifetime, and Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, who delivered the homily, ensured that the late Pope’s hostility to the policy was not forgotten.  Re said: “Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions ... ‘Build bridges, not walls,’ was an exhortation he repeated many times.”  Members of the clergy gather, ahead of the funeral Mass of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 26, 2025. Members of the clergy gather, ahead of the funeral Mass of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 26, 2025. Dylan Martinez/Reuters Trump and Francis had clashed repeatedly over the years, beginning in early 2016, when Francis criticized Trump’s plan to build a border wall, saying that anyone who thought only of building walls and not bridges “is not Christian.”  Trump responded angrily, calling it “disgraceful” for a religious leader to question his faith and accusing Mexico of manipulating the Pope. The bitter and very public exchange saw Trump label Francis as “a very political person.”  The homily may only have been an implicit rebuke, but after such a public clash over building walls, there can be no mistake that it was a deliberate and pointed one from the Vatican in front of millions watching around the world.

The coffin of Pope Francis is carried during the funeral Mass of Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 26, 2025. Kai Pfaffenbach/Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters Trump and the Pope had a cordial meeting in 2017 despite the public barbs that had been thrown, but tensions simmered beneath the surface. Francis continued to speak out against Trump’s policies, condemning his withdrawal from climate agreements and his rhetoric on immigration. Trump and his supporters, in turn, painted Francis as a political operator meddling beyond his spiritual role.  On Trump’s return to office, their feud exploded back into public view after Francis denounced Trump’s plans for mass deportations as “a disgrace,” accusing him of punishing the vulnerable.  Trump’s allies hit back, mocking the Pope’s criticisms by pointing to the high, secure walls around Vatican City.  Trump’s decision to travel to Europe, thrusting himself into the heart of the continent’s biggest diplomatic jamboree, exposed him to intense lobbying from European leaders who violently disagree with what they see as his appeasement of Russia.  Nonetheless, his meeting with Zelensky raised hopes that a breakthrough in a peace deal on the Russia-Ukraine war could be imminent a day after Trump said Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” on ending the war.  Zelensky’s office posted photographs of the two men sitting on a pair of chairs in St. Peter’s Basilica.  “We discussed a lot one-on-one. Hoping for results on everything we covered,” Zelensky tweeted. “Protecting the lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has the potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results.”  Hope surged further after the White House said the two men are due to meet again before Trump departs I",SpeedySloth51221,2025-04-26T21:47:45,1

"It wasn’t questioning Trump’s faith. It was highlighting Trump’s lack of empathy. He somehow muscled his way to a front row seat that he didn’t deserve to get the photo ops and it backfired big time. Does anyone believe that he was there to show his respects? He’s probably glad that the Pope is one less thorn in his side and I can’t help but think that he’ll want to add the Vatican as another target for him to conquer and plunder. That would be the biggest heist of all time with priceless treasures and a few Blackhawks with elite teams could take the place and secure it very quickly.   He’s a snowflake, so he must be angry, but he got what he wanted by being a major point of focus. At funerals, it’s not about you, which is something I don’t know he would be able to understand, so he had the perfect seat for what he deserved to hear and could have slept through the whole thing if he had gotten a seat in the back. Although anyone with any semblance at all knows better to speak ill of the dead, we’ll likely be seeing a week or more of savage tweets and statements taking swings at that “overrated Pope who was dumb as a rock” or whatever. Instead of it being a message to be kind and to use actions instead of just words if you want to try to come off as being religious, he’ll view it as a personal attack that he has to fight. Good luck with that, though. Threats and trash talk don’t work as well against someone who’s already dead. He got put in his place by someone who was far above him in status and did it from beyond the grave. Whether it was said or not, the association of that statement from the Pope would have still been made by most of the world anyway. It was the elephant in the room.

"He's an adult convert.   If I were to hazard a guess, he converted not out of religious experiences, but because he sees the Catholic church as the bastion of White Culture (TM).  Which is funny to me because there are people who convert to other religions because of, like, spiritual experiences. Or how such things can affect one's religious practice even if it isn't a conversion. (This gets into a longer discussion about the issue of religious flexibility versus inflexibility by religion. It's quite common for people in polytheistic religions to adopt new gods from other people into their own practice without discarding their other stuff, like how the Romans adopted Egyptian gods like Isis, or how Ishtar/Astarte was such a popular ancient deity.)  And then there's also how the Catholic Church is more diverse than the Evangelical denominations of the US. However, Evangelical cultural shit is exceedingly sterile, hence the plain churches that look more like a conference centers or auditoriums instead of a religious center.

I’ve got news for you. Every single border is being used to traffic drugs and humans. Every place has awful human beings not just the places with brown people.,QuestoPresto,2025-04-26T12:11:58,2

You are talking nonsense and it's annoying that you can't grasp that.   Pope is the representative of God. What he says is by definition God's words. It is impossible for him not to align with the teachings of God. He is basically God's voice. That's like saying... God's voice doesn't align with God's teachings.   Does that not sound stupid to you?   If you don't align with what he says... Then you aren't aligning with God. You need to reconcile that with God and your conscience.   I wish you luck.,ImmoKnight,2025-04-26T20:51:02,2

No. We don’t need walls any more than we need something to protect us against chariots or siege towers. I’m not saying you can’t solve modern problems with ideas from 852. I’m just saying only an idiot starts looking for solutions in 852.,QuestoPresto,2025-04-26T12:26:58,2
"The foreign invasion stopped?! What planet do you live on. Are you just going to gloss over my comment where I mentioned I had been to the Vatican multiple times? Do you think I’m the Pope? Or what about the 20,000 people who visit the Sistine Chapel daily? Do you think they are all Vatican residents? The last time I went the Chapel was standing room only with people from all over the world. What would that be except a foreign invasion?",QuestoPresto,2025-04-26T11:51:45,2

"nobody said the only solutions to a foreign invasion is a solution from 852. this might blow your mind, but multiple solutions can (and are) being implemented at the same time!    only an idiot would think otherwise. ;)",Several_Director6321,2025-04-26T12:30:55,0
"uhh yeah dude, the walls were originally built around the Vatican to protect from Muslim invasion. did you see the Vatican being invaded by Muslim raiders while you were there?   what you saw would not be an invasion of any kind, if you knew the definition of the word:   an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force",Several_Director6321,2025-04-26T11:53:44,0
"sharpen your mind, not your swords",Several_Director6321,2025-04-26T12:09:41,0
Are any of those other solutions going to make the new wall ladder proof or dig a hole underneath proof or stop a drone flying over proof or a tank driving through proof?,QuestoPresto,2025-04-27T11:16:49,1
So you think the purpose of the wall Trump is building is to protect us from a country invading with an armed force? Do you think it will be made of adamantium? Do you believe adamantium is real? Or are you saying that the Vatican walls which are really nothing more than a pile of rocks assembled in 852 could be used to keep out an armed invasion today? Even though they literally stay open all the time and people routinely come and go through them with no oversight or supervision. Again I’m just trying to understand how the two things are related?!,QuestoPresto,2025-04-26T12:07:27,2
So you're saying you don't need walls.,ultimateknackered,2025-04-26T12:43:25,3
"the purpose is to protect the US from ANY foreign invasion.   I'm not really sure how this is so hard for you to understand: Vatican walls were built to stop foreign invaders. they successfully stopped the invasion, which is obvious by the simple fact that the Vatican still exists. US walls are being built to stop foreign invaders    how do you not understand this? it's pretty simple",Several_Director6321,2025-04-26T12:14:06,0
