"It accomplishes basically nothing.  It is basically a slap on the wrist; mostly it's about the political posturing of the people who voted for the censure.  The censure itself generally has no effect on the political career as far as I've seen, (I have not looked deeply into the history of it); though it's possible that the underlying actions had some effect on how the electorate will vote, but the censure itself doesn't seem to sway anybody.",zlefin_actual,2023-11-16T07:21:47,1
