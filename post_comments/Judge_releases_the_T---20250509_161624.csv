"I will believe it when she is actually released, not just when her release has been ""granted"".   The Trump administration has a long history of ignoring court orders.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-09T16:20:16,10
This is great news. But how pathetic is it that we are celebrating the release of a college student that was in jail for 6 weeks for writing an article?,no_kids-and-3_money,2025-05-09T16:22:51,8
"Is there any evidence she's been released at all? I can't find anything, and for that matter I can't find anything indicating she's still in the country or even alive.",noncongruent,2025-05-09T16:31:58,6
"Very glad she is to be released, despite her physical and mental health having been compromised.  Trump heathens are a DISGRACE to this nation!   MANY MANY LAWSUITS .. INCOMING",XSinTrick6666,2025-05-09T16:31:30,3
Nice to see a District judge got this done. But expect others to be taken away until there is physical push back. These unidentified folks in masks with unmarked vehicles are going to find out the 2A extends to ALL citizens... Even green card holders.,williamgman,2025-05-09T17:20:38,3
"I will believe it when she's actually released. And I hope she sues them into oblivion.  EDIT:.. Sweet, it looks like she was ! https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/bail-hearing-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-detained-in-louisiana/3708999/?at",jmnugent,2025-05-09T16:57:57,2

She hasn’t been freed yet.,ToneSenior7156,2025-05-09T17:24:49,1
The judge isn't the one who's been holding her. Has ICE actually released her yet?,snoo_spoo,2025-05-09T17:43:32,1
Pathetic is a massive understatement.,Hazer_123,2025-05-09T16:26:23,4
