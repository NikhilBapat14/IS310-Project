Primaries are a good thing if the incumbents are so great they should have no problem winning. This is the stuff that angers me the most about the party they claim to be democratic but within the party they clearly are not. They are more then happy to put there fingers on the scale to get rid of progressives and primary them.  I wont be voting for my representative Marie Perez and will be angry if they undermine anyone who runs a primary against her.,sedatedlife,2025-04-24T17:25:09,128

"> I feel like you are making this more complicated than it needs to be.  It's called painting the bicycle shed. Comes up A LOT when progressives make the news.  Law of triviality   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality   > The law of triviality is C. Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly give ***disproportionate weight to trivial issues***.[1] Parkinson provides the example of a fictional ***committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed***, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.    >  > The concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader ""Parkinson's law"" spoof of management. He dramatizes this ""law of triviality"" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: ""The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved."" ***A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see ambiguity aversion), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.***[4] >  > ***After a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details***. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.[3] >  > Behavioral research has produced evidence which confirms theories proposed by the law of triviality. ***People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should***. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, then they will tend to feel overwhelmed by large and complex matters and stop collecting information too early to adequately inform their big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time and working hard to understand its complex ramifications. This leaves more of an opportunity to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should devote little attention and act without hesitation, they may inefficiently continue to ponder for too long, partly because they are better able to understand the subject.[5]  >",tech57,2025-04-24T18:48:12,1

Edit: Lol. you might like this summary from ChatGPT: ""After Super Tuesday in March 2020, several moderate Democratic candidates—such as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Michael Bloomberg—dropped out of the presidential primary and endorsed Joe Biden. Their decision was largely strategic and aimed at consolidating support around a single centrist candidate to counter Bernie Sanders, who was leading the progressive wing of the party at the time.  Many Democratic leaders and voters were concerned that a divided moderate vote would allow Sanders to win the nomination with only a plurality. By coalescing around Biden, the moderates hoped to unify their base and present a stronger challenge to Sanders. The endorsements and withdrawals helped Biden build momentum, and he went on to secure the Democratic nomination.""",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-25T08:40:27,1
The only people silencing progressive candidates are progressive voters who don’t get out and vote because no candidate will pass their purity test.   Minnesota??,Emotional_Spread5503,2025-04-24T22:56:10,0
"Like I haven't had this conversation a thousand times already.  I'm aware of the details, they don't add up to what you claim they do.   Bernie doesn't get more than 30-40% of the primary vote. He is not entitled to the vote being split several ways to he can have a contested convention.   If he didn't want the other candidates to drop out, he should have funded their campaigns. Those things burn cash and run out if they don't have momentum. That shit wasn't a conspiracy, it was inevitable after Biden crushed everyone in SC.",Silent-Storms,2025-04-25T08:50:05,1
"...and also laboring under the delusion that the primary process isn't 100% controlled by the DNC, in individual states, a lot of which are not open primaries.",zirwin_KC,2025-04-24T22:58:41,0
"He lost in large part thanks to legacy media ragging on him - remember Chris Matthews from MSNBC freaking out on tv about Bernie? And also the DNC and old-school Dems teaming up together to do their best to crush his chances. Buttigieg getting a call from Obama, dropping out, and then getting a Secretary position definitely didn't look innocent. Neither did the Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Donna Brazille fiasco.",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-26T06:05:31,0
"> If he didn't want the other candidates to drop out, he should have funded their campaigns.  That's such a weird take. So, if Sanders wanted to win he should have ""bought"" the other candidates is what you are saying. Such a neo-lib old-school Dem view of how to play politics and totally antithetical to Bernie's way of doing politics - he hates big money in politics. Also, why a lot people are turned off by the old-school Dems. They're corporatists money men through and through.  Also, do you think it is morally acceptable for Buttigeieg to get promised a Secretary position if he drops out and backs Biden, which is almost certainly what happened? Would you consider that a ""conspiracy"" if it were true?",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-26T06:00:42,1
"Open primaries or not, progressives still lose. Look at Bernie vs Biden.",Emotional_Spread5503,2025-04-24T23:00:36,1
"I'm being a bit facetious, but the point is campaigns run out of money when the candidate isn't doing well. Bernie is a bit of an exception because he'll squeeze more donations no matter what. When the campaigns run out of money, they stop. It's why there are always 2-3 left at the end of a primary.   Bernies strategy was not very smart, and acting like the inevitable result was a conspiracy is not endearing.  Nobody was promised anything.  You guys might get more traction without words like neolib and corporatist. They don't add anything to your argument except for emphasizing your personal bias",Silent-Storms,2025-04-26T10:05:07,1
"Lol. Neo-liberals and corporatists are what they ARE tho.  Nobody was promised anything? Do you have evidence of that? I don't have hard evidence, but the optics are hard to deny. Plus the evidence in the Hillary, Wasserman-Schultz, Brazille case IS there.  You guys might get more traction if you abandon neo-liberalism and being bought by coporations + allowing insider stock trading.  Look at the crowds and support AOC and Bernie are pulling now. Where's Kamala? Hillary? Biden? They're old hat. Get out of the new road if you can't lend a hand. The time are changing.",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-26T13:32:12,1
"Buzzword buzzword buzzword.  There is no evidence of a deal being made.   More buzzwords.   If rally size correlated to actual votes, Bernie would not be capped at 35% in a primary.",Silent-Storms,2025-04-26T14:02:28,1
"I'm sorry it's so hard for you to accept that the DNC historically has been shady with respect to Bernie and that the optics of that last primary line up with that. Also, there's no evidence that a deal wasn't made. I'd like them to dispell that given how things looked.  I'm also sorry that you cannot accept that Hillary, Kamala, Biden, and the majority of old-school Dems suck the corporate teet. lol. As if that's even deniable. Also, if you know the definition of neo-liberalism, it shouldn't be hard to accept that they are neo-liberals. Clinton was one of the biggest proponents of neo-liberalism.",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-26T14:11:39,0
I'm sorry that you and many others feel the need to believe conspiracy shit to cope with an election loss a decade after the fact.   The way the term is used now makes it fully meaningless. Its the same as when a republican says marxist.,Silent-Storms,2025-04-26T15:18:43,1
"I'm sorry you can't fathom the DNC/old-school Dems worked hard in many ways to suppress Bernie. Just like they've also been working hard to suppress AOC. I asked for evidence that they didn't. I'm not saying it did happen but it sure seems suspect given the history of the DNC.  Denying that the old-school dems suck the corporate teet is hilarious. This is why they will continue to lose. Every sane person sees through the facade. That's why Bernie and AOC are so popular now.   Also, where are Kamala and Hillary? Don't they care to stop this MAGA madness? Or maybe they just don't really care after all now that their vanity campaigns are over. Where's Pelosi? -- probably more concerned about her stock portfolio.  Keep supporting sellout two-faced losers and don't be surprised when they sell us out and lose again.",sillyhillsofnz,2025-04-26T15:49:36,0
