"I initially took it generally to mean the end of America's status as the world's hegemonic superpower. Geopolitically it's the hot topic which unites Russia and China, and it will be sweet music to Putin's ears. Dedollarization may be one aspect of it but there are others too. I struggle to believe Xi was referring to anything specific, and certainly not to Hong Kong/Taiwan/anything like that.",SamBrev,2023-04-28T17:16:19,26

"Anti western sentiment is an odd way of framing it...but...  I'd look up China's Hundred Year Plan.  This is a real thing, the Chinese aren't thinking in short bits of time. They fully intend to be the only superpower.  It isnt about the US NOT being a power, it is very much about China being the only or at least vastly dominant one.  I suspect Xi is talking about a multi-pronged shift in power.  Taiwan, Hong Kong and the South China Sea in one fell swoop perhaps.

They teach this in schools from an early point.  I was in China and Korea.  Koreans were incensed about this dispute over an island that Japan also lays claim to.  There were racist depictions of the Japanese as buck-toothed aggressors. This island is basically a rock jutting out of the water.  We in America have children making pledges to the flag in first grade.  Those kids have only the faintest idea of what they're pledging and why.

They control the internet. Propaganda works better because people still think they are free but they are in fact free itâ€™s just that they have a huge amount of stupid and apathetic people who donâ€™t know what is going on and canâ€™t think for themselves about this. The downside is that we are divided not United and in China they bypass this exchange and just shoot straight for having a minority that understands not to trust them even a bit and know they arenâ€™t free if they revolt and a huge majority that believes everything the leadership says.,[deleted],2023-04-29T14:49:16,2

">Taiwan was still considered part of China  By who?  Sun Yat-Sen never considered Taiwan to be part of China... he traveled to Taiwan only 4 times, and always just to meet with the Japanese government there in an attempt to raise funds for his revolution.  Even Mao himself didn't start claiming Taiwan as part of China's ""lost territories"" until World War 2 and the KMT occupation... and his original position was that he would help the Taiwanese in their struggle for independence from the Japanese imperialist.

This means that Manchuria must be regained. **We do not, however, include Korea, formerly a Chinese colony, but when we have re-established the independence of the lost territories of China, and if the Koreans wish to break away from the chains of Japanese imperialism, we will extend them our enthusiastic help in their struggle for independence.

"This covers Sun Yat-Sens's beliefs about Taiwan:  >In recalling the course of the National Revolution, it seems of special significance that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's firstÂ coup de mainÂ in Canton in October, 1895, took place on the heels of the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. He sought to assure national integrity, to free the nation from the yoke of foreign influence. He was aware that Taiwan had always been a part of China, and was convinced it should continue to be so.  https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4&post=7062  Mao in 1938 was the leader of the Communist party, not the leader of China. In 1938, he also didn't know that the Japanese were going to be defeated. In any event, Taiwan's status was reaffirmed in 1943:  >At the end of 1943,Â the Cairo Declaration was issued, including among its clauses that all territories of China, including Formosa (Taiwan), that Japan had occupied would be returned to Republic of China.

"A few things:  1) I never said the intelligence community thinks we are beat.  I said they recognize the strength and threat that exists.  There is a difference.  This runs in stark contrast to your (completely evidence free) assertion that they are no threat at all.  2) Again, you show an utter lack of knowledge about that which are speaking (which feels odd considering your user name).  The J-20 is no joke, and certainly isn't as far behind as you'd like to think.  It has the potential to do quite a bit of surface damage as well as defend against air superiority (something we have had completely unmitigated in every war in the past 40 years).

If you expect me, or anyone else for that matter, to take you seriously you're going to have to provide some sort of evidence for your claims.  What I have said is not Chinese propaganda, it is western intelligence assessment.  Someone much smarter than either of us once said ""If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.""

"> Taiwan was part of the Qing Dynasty for a couple hundred years before it was ceded, under duress, to the Japanese.   Barely... the Qing never crossed into the mountains or claimed control over the eastern half of the island. At their peak, they only claimed like 30% of the island.  The Japanese were the first power to rule the entire island under a single government, and it took them nearly 3 decades of expeditions before they claimed complete control over the island.  ---- >I'm not sure why you would think that Sun Yat Sen was out there going 'Yay!
