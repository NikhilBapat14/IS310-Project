With no exaggeration: North Dakota, West VA, and Pennsylvania power the cities of the East Coast. And Wyoming and Arizona power much of the American southwest.   Water? Well, 25% of that water is from other states - imperial county specifically gets almost all its agriculture water from a river that California doesn't even border. That dam that provides the water was a public works project paid for wh n California was hardly even 5 million people, and the rest of the Southwest was practically an uninhabited desert.

Switzerland, the richest normal state (not a tax haven or petrostate) is at $99,000.  Californians are incredibly productive, and is the reason why so many of them are so well paid.  What’s crazier is when you look regionally. The Bay Area has a GDP per capita of $150,000.

This is the real question.  It doesn’t matter how large the economy is if the average person doesn’t feel its benefits.  Otherwise it’s just completely meaningless and causes people to bash CA.  Yes some of that isn’t in good faith but some of that is valid.  Polls of people taken in California show that the average citizen is fed up with the current state of things at the state and local level.  After a decade plus of a supermajority the Dems have gotten complacent and in some cases corrupt.  The republicans just get more batshit crazy.

"I'm afraid to be the one to break this to you, but red states have tons of people in them who suffer as minorities of some form - be it race, sexuality, gender, or disability. Furthermore, democrats are absolute dogshit, too. They supported Israel's genocide of Palestine because of personal gain. They tried to run on a ""tough on crime"" platform that's always inherently racist because they target minorities instead of the same oligarchs supported by republicans. There's been years of recent controversies of racist governors and corrupt politicians in blue. Even Bernie Sanders and AOC have flipflopped on their messaging and shown to be ineffectual ""leaders"" when they bark up a storm but have no bite to back their words up. Instead they ALWAYS fall in line with their blatantly corrupt party at the end of the day, like Bernie trying to rally his base behind his good friends Hillary and Biden; and AOC calling Pelossi ""mama bear"" when she finally had some semblance of power and credibility. Or Obama being the whole (not literally, but in large part) reason we're in this whole position. He was a neoliberal that sabotaged our chances at universal healthcare in favor of Obamacare - an adopted version of Republicans' Romneycare. It's been repeated ad nauseum how many people he bombed and deported. He (and many dems) was anti-gay until it was politically convenient. He failed to codify Roe v Wayde. Meanwhile, if Trump handled the pandemic like shit (which he did), then Biden flat out didn't even try. He moved to block student debt relief but refused to use his executive powers to do much of anything that would benefit the average person's life. To make a point, a lot of rich and famous people vote democrat and like to believe they share similar moral values. But at the end of the day, class solidarity always far outweighs their need to feel woke. Just look at Elen Degeneres getting along with war criminal George Bush at a ball game. Also, America is America because Americans think like Americans.

"Get real.  “His very first political scandal happened in 2000 when he was running for a board of supervisors spot in San Francisco. During that campaign, he paid $500 to appear on a slate card that was backed by Republicans that also encouraged voters to vote for George W. Bush because why the fuck not?  And it worked. He won that election. And he teamed up with Republicans again in 2007.  There was this measure proposed that would have implemented something called question time at the board of supervisors. And I think it did end up getting implemented. But all it really was was the mayor would have to go talk to the board of supervisors every month about policy stuff and like actually talk about it.  And I think it was going to be televised, like people could watch it. And Gavin Newsom was like, no, no, I don't want any part of that. And fucking buddied up with Republicans to throw a big fundraiser to oppose that.  And then all the homelessness stuff. When he was mayor of San Francisco, super duper expanded their anti panhandling laws to include like freeway exits, median strips, things like that. And then, I “don't know if people remember this part, but when the Supreme Court made it essentially illegal to not have a place to sleep, Gavin Newsom was one of the first governors in this country who was like, hell yeah, clear out those homeless encampments.

"Sure the resources you pay for. The infrastructure and interstate transmission lines, Dam and Reservoir maintenance, River control, even something as simple as highways are built by the feds for Mutual benefit of all the states knowing that resources are not in every state.   My state has the single highest per-capita infrastructure cost in the nation. Why? Because urban centers are West of us, and the food is grown east of us. Neither could get to either if it weren't for infrastructure in my state. We have nowhere near the population to pay for that...so, what happens? The feds subsidize us so we can repair the infrastructure that benefits other states. It only makes sense that other states pay for it - it doesn't economically benefit us at all.   Hell, Wyoming has the most road per capita than any state, and they hardly have 500k people to pay for it.  But if it weren't for those roads, multiple states and urban centers would be going dark.   Remember, a lot of this stuff isn't state built. This stuff was built by the feds, maintenance was given to the states, and standards are in place. I would love nothing more than for my state to give up maintenance of an info structure grid that benefits other states - it's like 1/3 of our budget. But that will collapse multiple systems that others rely on.   You know how Texas is having  power grid issues constantly now? And severe price volatility? That's because they went to their own grid. They silo'd themselves. The feds have done the opposite to ensure that every state has every resource they need. And yes, it's paid for by everyone, but only the ones who have the infrastructure need to maintain it....and those are states with the natural resources...which tend to be low population conservative states.",ExplosiveDisassembly,2025-04-24T18:13:34,-2

"Here’s the deal: That claim is a half-truth often thrown around for political effect, but the reality is more nuanced.  Is California the “highest” in welfare per capita?  It depends on how you define “welfare.” If you’re talking about traditional Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), California has historically had a larger share of the nation’s caseload because it has higher benefits and broader eligibility compared to many other states. However, if you include programs like SNAP (food stamps), Medicaid, or housing assistance, the rankings shift — and some red states (like Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia) often top those lists on a per capita basis, especially for SNAP and Medicaid.  Why does California have a high number of welfare recipients?  Simple: it’s the most populous state, and it has some of the highest housing costs and income inequality. Many working people still qualify for aid because wages haven’t kept up with the cost of living. California’s safety net is also intentionally designed to be more accessible than many conservative states, where eligibility rules can be much stricter.  And yes, California is very blue.  It leans heavily liberal on most social policies, and its state government supports a more expansive social safety net. But the idea that “liberal = more welfare” is oversimplified. Many of the poorest states (and highest aid recipients per capita) are actually deep red states with conservative leadership — they just receive a lot of federal aid.  TL;DR:  California does have a large welfare caseload, partly due to its size, high cost of living, and more inclusive policies. But “highest per capita” depends on the program, and several red states are right up there (or higher) on various forms of assistance.",gayporn4mes,2025-04-24T18:07:26,5

"That actually makes total sense, and I appreciate the breakdown. You’re right — infrastructure like that doesn’t recognize state lines, and the benefits flow far beyond the borders where the physical resources or roads sit. It’s a shared system, and without federal support, a lot of it wouldn’t be economically sustainable for the individual states tasked with maintaining it.  I also totally get the frustration of having to shoulder that cost locally when the real benefit is regional or even national. The Wyoming example is a perfect illustration. People forget that someone has to pay to keep those arteries open, and often it’s the folks who live where the infrastructure happens to be — not the ones profiting from the access.  The Texas grid example really drives it home: going solo on critical infrastructure can sound good on paper, until it doesn’t work.  Thanks for laying it out so clearly.

Yet the pay in those states is lower than the pay in California. California also houses big tech companies that have the highest wages in the country.

"I’m going to push back on that, because honestly, that argument doesn’t hold up.  First, the idea that California’s problems are because people aren’t “proving citizenship” to get benefits is political spin, not fact. The vast majority of social services are accessed by U.S. citizens, not undocumented people. And tying the homeless crisis to immigration is just a distraction from the real issues.  Let’s be clear: the homelessness crisis exploded because of a long history of failed housing policy, mental health system collapse, and lack of affordable options—not because of “safe injection sites” or needle exchanges. People didn’t suddenly become homeless because someone gave them a clean needle. They became homeless because rent outpaced wages, mental health care was gutted, and shelters weren’t built because NIMBYs fight them at every turn.  You mention California wages—but those numbers don’t reflect reality for the vast majority of workers. Yes, tech and union trades pay well. But most people aren’t in tech or in a union. Try talking to teachers, grocery clerks, restaurant workers, gig drivers, or health aides scraping by at $20 an hour while gas is $6 and rent is $2,500 for a one-bedroom. That’s the California story for millions.  As for taxes—yes, California taxes heavily. No argument there. But blaming taxes alone is lazy economics. States like Texas and Florida might brag about no state income tax—but they hit working people harder with property taxes, sales taxes, toll roads, and regressive fees. Meanwhile, their wages are lower, healthcare is worse, and worker protections are weaker.  You want to make it political? Fine. Here’s the politics: this isn’t about red or blue. It’s about whether leadership at any level is willing to actually address root causes instead of scapegoating immigrants and people struggling with addiction.

I literally just checked Zillow for the average rent on a 1 bedroom  People in California always want to exaggerate the cost of living there to play victim. If you look into property ownership though, yes it’ll be higher. But thats because the location, it’s close to the ocean and anything close to an ocean is going to cost you more. The further you get from the ocean the prices will drop. But places like Nevada, Colorado and Utah are only 40-50k lower. The wages there are also lower.  Cities like San Francisco have had $25/hr minimum wage for a while. People that rely on jobs meant for teenagers, college students, and disabled people to make a living though you can’t blame them for not making it. Also don’t bring up teachers, my father in law is a teacher in Santa Rosa and makes $100k/year and has an entire summer break. An ex girlfriend is making $95/ yr in San Jose.

Trade unions only ask for a high school education and that’s it. The only ones struggling are the ones that choose not to improve their situations.

LA is where the drought is that caused the fires. It’s dry. The fires are not caused by a lack of water supply.   Let’s repeat that - there is no water supply problem in California.,SwitchySoul,2025-04-25T09:48:43,1

"Freedom, consent, self-determinism, not potentially being locked into a sinking ship that no longer reflects your ideals or supports your population.

You can hover over any of the counties in that graphic and see (by vote total) that there is more than enough people in the red areas to overwhelm the blue. A theoretical version of California split into thirds would have to be comically anti-geographic to ensure three blue states.  Not that it really matters anyway since it's never going to happen.,smersh101,2025-04-24T12:08:00,0

"Nobody blamed undocumented people or addicts. I simply said that’s how you inflate the numbers of people on welfare. You’re arguing for the sake of arguing. It’s as if you are browsing what I’ve said and not even reading it. You argue something and when I give facts and numbers you want to twist it into a blame game. And no… I didn’t mention a number for rent that was you. Clearly you fail at even going back on the conversation to see who has said what. I said the numbers are close to states next door by 100-200 dollars.  Don’t get shit twisted here and try and throw words in my mouth. Just face facts here bud, you aren’t as up on things as you think nor are you as smart as you’d like to lead on. Just accept the fact that you can’t blame a red vs blue thing because it’s more complex than that. Also acceptance fact that you still can’t explain where this money goes… which is the question I raised to begin with. “Oh it’s because they’re sending money to red states”  Laughable. California can’t even take care of their own let alone another states deficit. I’m clearly implying the government is hiding the money and not using it to improve quality of life.  You wanted to turn it into a republican bashing and I didn’t align with that view and now you’re back peddling.",qo0ch,2025-04-25T06:34:48,1

"Ah yes—freedom by running away. Self-determinism through fantasy politics and zero plan for how to actually govern 40 million people, maintain defense, or stabilize the economy. Bold strategy.  But here’s the thing: real self-determination isn’t quitting the game because you’re losing. It’s showing up and fighting smarter. You don’t burn your house down because the plumbing’s bad—you fix the plumbing. Or do you?  The “sinking ship” argument is cute until you realize your solution is to jump overboard with no life raft, no allies, and no navy—hoping the sharks are feeling merciful.  What you’re pitching isn’t self-determinism. It’s surrender dressed up as revolution.",gayporn4mes,2025-04-25T01:34:29,0

"No one’s backpedaling. I’m just not interested in your bad faith takes. You keep claiming I twisted your words, but I’ve responded directly to what you wrote — the problem is, you don’t like being challenged on it.  You came in making claims about inflated welfare numbers, and when pressed, shifted the goalposts again and again. Now you’re accusing me of turning this into some partisan blame game when, in fact, you’re the one who brought up the framing that way.  You don’t get to rewrite the conversation just because you’re losing ground. The question of where the money goes is valid — but your argument has been all over the place, and I’m not here to play catch-up while you move the target.  So go ahead, tell yourself whatever version of this exchange makes you feel better. I’m not wasting any more time on it.",gayporn4mes,2025-04-25T06:46:13,1
True. Iowa/Illinois - nope. I also think it’s geography too. The bigger the river the bigger the floodplain.

"Secession doesn’t magically erase conflict—it just redraws the lines and guarantees new ones. Whether you call it civil war or “war with a new country,” it’s still a fight between people who used to share a flag, a border, and a history. Same blood, same land, same mess—just a different name on the paperwork.     My vision of fighting for a better country doesn’t rely on the fantasy of clean breakups. It looks like organizing, voting, protesting, running candidates, building coalitions, forcing the system to bend. Not because it’s easy—but because that’s what adults do when they want lasting change instead of tantrums dressed up as revolution.  Leaving is easy. Staying and fixing what’s broken is the real fight.",gayporn4mes,2025-04-25T04:07:32,1
