"For a long time, I thought it was just his narcissism, because narcissists tend to live in the moment and will say really wild and inconsistent shit. Lately, though, I do think there's significant cognitive decline on top of the narcissism.",snoo_spoo,2025-05-09T11:43:24,71
">‚ÄúThe problem with even a ‚ÄòTINY‚Äô tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‚ÄòRead my lips,‚Äô the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election. NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I‚Äôm OK if they do!!!‚Äù Trump wrote.
