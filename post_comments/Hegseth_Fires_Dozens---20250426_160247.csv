Hegseth has a plum position and Trump could definitely replace him. Hegseth isn‚Äôt an impressive person: he‚Äôs a celebrity primarily. There are plenty of MAGA military people who could take his place.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-04-26T18:04:20,23
"> but he would be if his nominee failed to be confirmed.  This GOP senate has proven that literally anyone is confirmable.  Dr. Oz, Gabbard, RFK Jr., Patel, please.  The senate will rubber stamp any appointee.    Trump views Hegseth as a fighter because like Trump, he will never admit to a mistake.  He's the perfect employee.  Hegseth isn't going anywhere until enough soldiers die or the first foreign terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11",stripedvitamin,2025-04-26T19:16:14,8

We as Americans are too stupid to give a fuck about the Espionage Act. Drinking on the job is a basic no-no even MAGA understands ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   And something that blatantly obvious is the kind of thing the media would harp on until Trump is forced to fire him.

"The current administration is not going to go away because of any leaks that come out.   It does make them look more inept and cause a further divide though. Which is just pouring more gas on the fire. Which is something any rival/enemy would want to do. Especially if it is China and China wants the US to continue to mess up.   Just look at this article. Hegseth, the drunk, is firing dozens of people on the advisory board. That isn't going to make further peoples and agendas more reasonable and thought out. It's going to make things less reasonable, and less thought out. Next time he is drunk and making decisions the people who might calm him down and reason with him will be gone and the only people left behind yes men.",wildweaver32,2025-04-27T09:29:25,3
