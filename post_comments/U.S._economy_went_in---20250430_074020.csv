There's not enough time for a single Democrat term to make a difference anymore. The Biden administration made an admirable effort. Even then it was not enough time and power to put out the fires.    This time the damage is orders of magnitude greater. If I were American I'd be preparing for long term hardship. At least a decade. Maybe even the remainder of my life. The past several years will be looked on as relatively better times even though you all think it's the worst thing ever.    I'm in Canada and I'm already planning for far different future outlooks than what was just a few years ago.    Anyone who is still thinking this is left-right back-and-forth partisan politics where things always get better needs a reality check. It's coming anyways whether one wants to accept reality or not.

"What is incredibly crazy is the US “needs” around 3 percent growth.   Trump just got a 0 for 1/16th of his grade. This means now he has to have at least a 3.2 quarterly growth to get back to average. (Math isn’t 100 percent correct).   But just in general he has put himself in a huge hole - especially because he said he needed 4% growth for the tax cuts to pay for themselves.   Which means he would now need 4.3 percent (a full percentage point over avg) to get back to what is needed by his own standards.  It’s the same as a kid getting a 30 on their first quiz and expecting an A for the year. Just isn’t going to happen because you tanked your first grade, and are now operating out of a big hole.",patentattorney,2025-04-30T08:42:01,25

The reality that we live in a bubble economy that is based entirely on consumer confidence is a bit unsettling for me personally, but it also underscores how idiotic these tariffs are.

This is going to work as a triple whammy on car manufacturers and similar as they are going to be dealing with tariffs, which they will skinny some profits on, high consumer prices and the ability of consumers to push out orders of new vehicles to some later date.

"NX = net exports.  ""Spending is way down"" is not correct, spending was up 1.8%.  The reporting is emphasizing that this is ""down"" from the 4% increase last quarter.  But the average 4q increase in consumer spending in the US is \~4%, while the average 1q increase is closer to 0%, so spending is actually advancing more than average for this quarter.  This should be sort of common-sense, since we spend more around the 4q holidays, travel, vacation, etc. and relatively few people are doing those things in the crappy q1 weather.  More honest outlets that still want their political angle are saying its because consumers are front-running the tariffs.  I have some doubts, but that could be true.  Neutral outlets are just reporting that consumer spending is strong.  But no, even if they are NOT sold, they should be reported as inventory increases or investment.  GDP is, by definition, (gross DOMESTIC product), not supposed to to include imports, so they are always subtracted out from another category.  Any time imports drives GDP significantly down, we see a snap up next quarter.  Note that investment WAS historically high in Q1, too, which is not a thing businesses do when they are expecting near term problems.  BUT, could simply be how many of them are classifying the tariff front running, which would be the strongest case for a bad Q2, if that product doesn't sell.  I think it will though, and actual problems won't occur until late Q2/early Q3, as inventories run out and tariffs linger on (if there are no deals by then.  Probably there will be deal imho.) I think Q2 will see a very strong rubber-band effect from NX, and just as that is noise drowning out all the signal this quarter, so too will it be next quarter.",Tethrinaa,2025-04-30T12:29:29,1

PPP is benchmarked against the USD. Like no shit we are going to look bad. We're the 1 everything is compared against.,MicroBadger_,2025-04-30T10:57:21,1
"It's GDP with regards to purchasing power, which is not the same as a direct 1-to-1 comparison of GDPs. The US nominal value is still higher when accounting for a direct exchange rate, but another way economists can measure GDP is by saying how much can a person in that country purchase relative to another person in another country. If one country's barber for example costs $5 dollars and another costs $10 dollars (exchange rate equivalent) on average, the GDP of the $10 country would be nominally higher, but the effect would be the same i.e. one haircut was given. So PPP tries to say hey those two things are equivalent, so there's really no difference in their GDP, even if their is a nominal dollar difference.  Of course, this breaks apart whenever you have to purchase stuff from abroad. People from China can't come to the US or other higher GDP country and expect to live the same lifestyle just by converting their currency to the local version. And the reverse is generally true too, that Americans can go to China or other lower GDP country and simply have more money to spend on the same goods and services, increasing their living standards. So it's not quite accurate to say GDP in PPP (parity purchasing power) means the nominal GDP is the same, but it's one way of looking at it.",PM_ME_UR_JUMBLIE5,2025-04-30T10:00:15,2

One side says the imports alone can't cause a recession as they show up in other parts of the economy such as investment (and other things I guess). The  other is saying everything was positive except for government spending, but all the positives were cancelled by imports. It is showing the main positive was investment and main negative was imports. So, either investment is lagging imports or failing to offset it. Regardless, it's only three months, so my conclusion is that GDP has shrunk cos of imports this time. Next quarter, GDP might increase for a while as the country reduces imports and focuses on consuming everything in stock. Then everything will crash cos there will be no imports and no consumption, and no investment. This much may be inevitable.

Obviously people are trying to explain to the moron in charge that his actions are fucking things up but he enjoys the attention and so far everything he’s done so far might be crushing to most people but has made him personally much richer.",JDogg126,2025-04-30T09:41:50,2

"I mean, consumption was up in March already, which was included in the GDP report, and we still had a negative GDP number. We will see how April is, but past that, consumption will likely drop. While there is no guarantee, 2 months of tariff backlash on consumption may more than offset one month of tariffs just being implemented. But you may be right, it could be all delayed in the data, so it's hard to be certain.",PM_ME_UR_JUMBLIE5,2025-05-01T06:52:07,1

"I think that sounds like a fair assessment. But how do you take into account the effects of the tariffs and supply chains possibly drying up? I do think the effect is going to be significant enough that will undo this rebound/ reversion to the mean. it's not business as usual. And I do think general consumer spending is going to worsen moving forward, which maybe wasn't reflected in Q1.",purplebrown_updown,2025-04-30T12:40:46,1
">There is an increased risk of default, something previously not thought possible in the case of US bonds (it's baked into our Constitution, after all).  To be fair, that's what happens when the president openly questions the validity of US Treasury bonds.   I'm really surprised that his talk of fraud in Treasury bonds didn't hit the market harder/sooner. It shows how little faith investors actually have in the bullshit he spews.",UnmeiX,2025-04-30T10:45:39,34
"Yeah, it's pretty much the worst case scenario in theory. Luckily the effect is kind of modest for how bad the situation is.

"Rates are a indication of trust. There's a reason that payday loans are a bajillion percent.  Rate spikes mean that investors (in other words the big financial institutions, not you and me) don't trust that the US will pay its debts, which is a BIG FUCKING DEAL.  It also means that the US will have to pay more to borrow money, which means that Trump has fucked the American economy for the next 10 years at least.",ChibbleChobble,2025-04-30T17:13:13,4

"Yeah, not disagreeing with any of that going forward, I just think it will materialize in Q3, and is totally dependent on what happens between now and then.  My point is mostly that there is a structural error in the GDP numbers, and, (as always, sadly), the reporting is very dishonest about the interpretation/certainty of outcome.  And just in the interest of correctness, sometimes the quarterly GDP numbers are seasonally adjusted to account for that typical q4/q1 effect, and I don't see consistent reporting in datasets on whether they are using the seasonally adjusted numbers or not.  So this could be a slightly low Q1 consumer spending increase (avg \~3% seasonally adjusted), I can't verify which is reported here, too much noise from the recency of the numbers.",Tethrinaa,2025-04-30T13:00:19,1

Exchange rates are practically irrelevant for comparisons within one country. PPP tells you the real amount of production that happens. 1 tonne of steel is 1 tonne of steel regardless of what the nominal price is. You can build the same number of cars or buildings or pipes. Nominal is really only useful for trade. The relatively strong US dollar means that the US will favour imports.,Much-Neighborhood171,2025-04-30T11:08:28,2
