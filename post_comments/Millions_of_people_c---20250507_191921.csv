"If anybody was confused about what the Republican party stands for this administration has put it front and center. I have tried telling Republicans that they support privatization and they seem to be okay with that so that means housing, education, obviously healthcare, education, post offices, social security, even farming. They don't seem to realize how this will flip their lives around and that freedom of having a farm, small business, or house is not part of the republican corporatization plan.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-05-07T21:02:38,3

As long as Meal Team Six is not on Medicaid... It's all good with MAGA. Now... If Meal Team Six IS on Medicaid... Are they willing to die from an untreated medical condition..? Or exercising their 2A rights..? That will be the story down the road.,williamgman,2025-05-07T21:59:42,1

The response isn‚Äôt odd; that it‚Äôs a true response is the odd part.,MohandasBlondie,2025-05-07T21:03:56,2
"It‚Äôs the kind of response from someone who‚Äôs just as ignorant as most rural red staters. Texas (red) and Florida (red) are just as bad as Illinois (blue) on gun violence. New Mexico (blue) and Nevada (blue) are worse, but Alabama (red) and Louisiana (red) are **the** worst.",BigDaddyBain,2025-05-08T05:13:52,3
