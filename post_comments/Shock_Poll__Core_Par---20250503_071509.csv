"Article snippet:  > Donald Trump, who saw an increase in support from rural voters in the 2024 election, is now seeing huge defections, according to a new PBS/NPR/Marist poll. >  > The poll taken last week found that only 40 percent of rural voters approve of Trump’s job performance, down from 59 percent in February, according to Newsweek. Forty-five percent of respondents said they disapproved of Trump’s performance in April, which is up from 37 percent who said they disapproved in February. >  > In the weeks between polls, Trump has unveiled a slate of policy directives that threaten the livelihoods of rural voters, including his sweeping “reciprocal tariff” policy that has undermined essential trade with America’s top trading partners. >  > Last month, the European Commission agreed to levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on cigarettes from Florida, beef from Kansas and Nebraska, chicken from Louisiana, car parts from Michigan, and most importantly, soybeans—of which the European Union bought $2.43 billion’s worth in 2024... >  > Farmers were also hurt by Trump’s dismantling of USAID, which lost them $2 billion, and the administration’s upending of programs for farms to provide produce for schools and food banks lost them at least another $1 billion.  Trump's tariffs will affect [most farmers at some point](https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1k2dcex/maga_get_to_work/mnt8xwd/).",progress18,2025-05-03T07:15:19,9

They interviewed a number of his voters who agreed that his finest feature was being an asshole. He's getting THAT job done so they still support him.,YallerDawg,2025-05-03T08:58:17,3

"I recently read this piece where Cory Booker (bless him) talks about how we need to cultivate anti-trump republicans.  Like he's talking about bi-partisanship. Man, I appreciate his optimism, but that seems like politics of the past to me.  No republicans ARE standing up to Trump or HAVE(successfully), or WILL.  We need strong leadership in the DNC to fight this troll.  And by fight I don't mean with words.",swissarmychainsaw,2025-05-03T11:13:58,3

The only way they are going to sour on him is when things get bad. And probably not even then,Rosebunse,2025-05-03T12:38:14,2
That’s their problem. They supported him and voted for him. There are no take backs. They deserve everything he’s going to do to them. All of it. Just let me get my popcorn…,HaxanWriter,2025-05-03T15:20:52,2

They would still have voted for him over Harris. The Democrats need an identity and to speak to real Americans. Their only identity is they are anti-Trump.,WeenFan4Life,2025-05-04T00:11:38,1

"Look, at least the veneer is off now. We can stop pretending a sizeable force in this country cares about the rights of others, wanting everyone to succeed, and anything else that is beyond their own kitchen table.  This is why we need Democratic leaders who, when given the opportunity, are not afraid to ram through cost saving policies like Universal Health care or taxes on the ultra wealthy while they lower on the middle and lower classes.  Because the core people who will flip an election in their favor really don't give a shit about other people.",zappy487,2025-05-03T09:05:49,22

"Realistically you only need like 5% to switch.  Democrats have wasted their time on ""anti-Trump Republicans"" who no longer exist. Those Republicans that did truly hate Trump are now Democrats or Independents.  Conservative-leaning Indies will actually flip. Just get 5% more of white working class men to vote Democrat and shore up minority support and 2028 is your's.  Democrats like complicating strategy needlessly when Occam's razor just tells you to do the opposite of what you did last time.",I_Hate_Taylor_Swift_,2025-05-03T10:27:21,14
