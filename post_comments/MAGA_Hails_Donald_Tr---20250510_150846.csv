"Oh you mean the Ceasefire that didnt last a day?  At this point I think his handlers are just handing him a phone with one of them on the other end claiming to be some leader of some country and let the old man talk his shit about peace plans and trade deals... so he can tweet at night in peace.

"Pakistani here. I have no idea what role DT played but apart from much smaller skirmishes in Kashmir ,which unfortunately is a troubled region already, the ceasefire appears to be holding up.   Yesterday probably saw a peak where both countries’ drones were seen operating across the border in major cities. There were attacks on air bases either side of the border. So it seemed to be getting to a crescendo. The thought was both parties were trying to get a final “win” that they could claim infront of their local audiences. Expectations were pretty high that there would be a ceasefire in the next 24 hours specially with the news of a Saudi minister coming over.   The role of US if anything was extremely disappointing (not knowing what DT did last evening). JD Vance if anything was empowering a conflict by saying US “will stay out of it”.",Lopsidedconsultant,2025-05-10T15:24:00,1
