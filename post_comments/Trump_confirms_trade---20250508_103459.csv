Trump posted a [summary](https://i.imgur.com/vsdT0Z8.png) of the deal on [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114472881476812761)  ---  New Market Access: $5B in Exports  Increase in Tariff Revenue: $6B  UK Tariffs on US: From 5.1% to 1.8%  US Tariffs on UK: From 3.4% to 10%,DatTrumpDoh,2025-05-08T10:52:22,17
Any Economics majors care to explain?  Can the UK just say “let’s trade less with the Americans and trade more with other countries?”   Edit: now that I see it. There are texts at the bottom about the US having “unprecedented access” to various goods?,Bryschien1996,2025-05-08T15:39:00,1

">Can the UK just say “let’s trade less with the Americans and trade more with other countries?”  Quite the contrary, *they lowered the tariff for US goods meaning they will likely buy (or need) more goods with more volumes from US*. Adding to that, [having exited EU](https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7851/CBP-7851.pdf), they see US as a more potential supplier than their EU neighbors. The extension for this is, [UK will probably act as a hub to redistribute US goods further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCNRI704Nb4) (repacking, value adding, repurposing, processing, etc) into existing UK markets (both inside-out). VCs are going to splurge more money for new/rejuvenated UK ventures. Hopefully, we'll see more of ""Made in UK/Britain"" stuff in the future.   The counter tariff (10% for UK) is a signal for US manufacturers/producers to just simplify their products *for UK markets* (meaning UK tend to seek raw/half-baked materials) & at the same time US biz protected with higher tariff for imported (contender) goods from UK (if any).  But even if importing tariff from UK is mathematically higher (almost 3x than before the deal) it's not gonna be ""feel that much"" for US market right now since UK are still in industrial-hiatus ([they unlikely exporting more goods to US than vice versa but services](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/uktradewiththeunitedstates2023/2023)). If any, the tariff should force UK brands to *lower* their pre-tariff price to keep tapping with US market.  Some people are still confused with this tariff war, which is understandable, because even the most progressive people are extremely conservative with their money (thus, prefer archaic economic setting). But this whole trade war is actually an auction/invitation for the rest of the world to take over China's US market pie.  It's funny to see some people acting as if China's goods as irreplaceable (the same people that will double check those goods if they're fake or not). But I'm not gonna sugarcoat the fact that switching back our society back to industrial society isn't gonna be fast n easy. At least not in just a few months...",jerrycostanzakramer,2025-05-09T10:52:57,2

"Mainly, our tariff rate on English goods being over 5 times higher than theirs. I'll elaborate further if you'd like.",akbuilderthrowaway,2025-05-08T15:29:26,15
"They're reacting positively because it's movement in the direction of free trade. They're reacting positively because Trump seems to be back pedaling on his much broader tariff plans from not even a month ago. They are not reacting positively because this is a good deal, they're reacting positively because it seems like Trump is willing to come to his senses on the issue stop fucking around with the world economy for literally no reason.",akbuilderthrowaway,2025-05-08T15:35:37,23
