"Based on Bezos immediate capitulation to Trump this afternoon, I'm starting to wonder if these guys are really the power behind the Trump admin or if they are just being threatened and extorted by the Trump administration. I'm starting to think purchasing those seats was obligatory.",Strict_Inspection285,2025-04-29T14:34:16,8
"Those suckers. I've only lost about 1 / 1,000,000 (one one millionth) of what they've lost! So I'm good right?  That is going to hurt me 1,000,000 times harder. They won't even notice.",CockBrother,2025-04-29T14:50:39,3
How much did they buy up over the last month when markets tanked?  They’re about to be a lot richer as soon as the markets crank up again,GoodResident2000,2025-04-29T14:32:47,4
Got what they deserved.,CurrentlyLucid,2025-04-29T14:50:46,1
The question is why are they willing to loose that much and looking at the rate of automation and how it's being prepared and the policies being passed that will allow them to get rid of people with no compensation in a flash might have something to do with it,StillWritingeh,2025-04-29T14:51:39,1
I guess Trump isn’t **completely** worthless.,ChristopherMarv,2025-04-29T14:58:42,1
Was it worth it? There’s still time to change your views!,multisubcultural1,2025-04-29T15:42:16,1
Not enough apparently,Striker660,2025-04-29T15:50:18,1
But they are still rich. They are still billionaires while us plebs work like dogs. Prices are rising and with tariffs coming..thanks Trump you make us proud electing you TWICE.  Oh..about the 3rd term please sir we are tired of winning. So thank you sir.,Brief_Night_9239,2025-04-29T17:20:23,1
For now.  Lemme know in two years how they're doing.,mountaindoom,2025-04-29T18:17:43,1
It couldn't have happened to a more deserving group.,lbcnu,2025-04-29T23:48:16,1
i love that for them,HansBooby,2025-04-30T00:05:11,1
And they are all still grossly wealthy beyond any peasant's dreams.,HelmetVonContour,2025-04-29T19:31:37,1
"My portfolio lost almost 20% in value when the market dipped earlier in April. I DCA when the market was almost at the bottom and now my portfolio is almost back to it's original value, except I'm showing more gains now than before because I was able to pick up more shares on the cheap.  Anyone thinking these guys are worried about a month's worth of market movement needs to educate themselves on how the market works.",DatEPLife,2025-04-29T19:23:06,0
"Oh, I’m sure every corporate and institutional head is being threatened and shaken down by Trump. He’s fundamentally a thug and a criminal. He seems to get immense pleasure from betraying them one way or the other after getting them to bend the knee, kiss the ring, play several rounds of boar on the floor. The tech CEOs are incredibly naive. During the inauguration, they were essentially big game whose heads were mounted on his wall of conquests. ",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-04-29T14:50:41,4
