"The crime is the continued possession, not the original purchase. These things usually have a grace period.",BuckleUpItsThe,2023-07-04T22:22:07,7
"It depends on the law and how it's written. Most laws tend to have a grace period beyond which it becomes a crime to continue to own whatever the law bans.  There's some...hesitancy in the gun community about these kinds of rules, however, because of the tendency for bans to be repealed on legal challenge as well as people being punished for complying with these bans.",HeloRising,2023-07-05T03:46:27,3
"Your best bet in. Any instance is to personally get to know your local county sheriff (aka the elected official), get to know your police chiefs in your county and your county and city supervisors.    Worst case scenario - they'll let you know if their pursuing those infractions.  Most are not upholdinf laws they know the supreme court will shut down.    Or for better words, our govenrment' governors and such have purposely been attacking our laws and everyone knows it.",70-w02ld,2023-07-05T00:52:57,-1
