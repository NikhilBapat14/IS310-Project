"Good systems require checks and balances. If apple started making broken hardware or charging 10k for phones, people would change brands. So too, if your politician started wasting all public cash on blow and hookers, there would be accountability.   Healthcare has neither of those. Providers can charge what they like and people keep calling 911 and keep coming through the door in droves. And you can’t even vote against it. So it only gets worse.   But we’re not living in a vacuum, the only place in the universe with healthcare, staring at unknown options. Other countries fixed this generations ago.

"Lack of government intervention is one problem, but here are some other problems people don’t mention:  1) The boomer population is currently moving through the system. They’re a massive drain on resources. Meanwhile, the younger generations are literally just smaller. That means the expense load is spread across fewer people. Similar issue as with social security.   2) The US is very rural relatively speaking. It’s hard to serve non-urban populations because you have to build the infrastructure to do so. That adds to the whole system’s cost.   3) Most medical professions have to be well compensated because of how rigorous/expensive/long the work and educational pathways are, at least in the US. Even generic nursing has a somewhat higher barrier to entry relative to most degrees.",[deleted],2022-09-27T06:31:21,6

Start with the Stabilization Act of 1942 under FDR which caused employers to offer healthcare as a fringe benefit under the salary caps. A 1943 War Labor Board decision made health insurance exempt from wage controls. And then the Revenue Act of 1954 confirmed that such fringe benefits were always tax deductible as long as your employer purchased it for you. Thus the two were tied together forever moving forward and the rest is history. Employer-based coverage is an artificial construct caused by our omnipotent government meddling in the marketplace.,clarkstud,2022-09-27T13:52:00,2

"Medicare and Medicaid have Set Prices  **The resource-based relative value scale (RBRVS) is the physician payment system used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and most other payers.**    * In 1992, Medicare significantly changed the way it pays for physician services.

Likewise, if you've got some rare cancer no one has ever heard of? There's a good chance America is the only place you can get the care you need.

"It might be a blanket statement, but it's a blanket statement backed by historical fact and reality. The biggest problem with healthcare in this country is exorbitant cost brought on by:  **Employer-Based Insurance**  In 1942, FDR signed Executive Order 9250, establishing the Office of Economic Stabilization. In doing so, he effectively froze wages across the country. This led employers to get creative with how they compensated their employees and led to expanding benefits packages, which often included health care insurance. In 1943, the IRS exempted employer-based health insurance from taxation, effectively incentivizing job-based insurance over private plans. These two actions directly led to the abandonment of catastrophic insurance policies, and today health insurance pays for even small ailments and sick visits.  Imagine if we treated car insurance the same way we treat healthcare. Should your car insurance pay for your gas or oil changes? Of course not. Health insurance paying for routine doctor visits is essentially the same practice, and as a result, insurance costs have skyrocketed.   **The FDA**  Skip ahead twenty years and the Kefauver-Harris Drug Amendments are passed, giving the FDA the power to regulate efficacy of a drug for the first time. This lead to a whole host of sweeping regulations which suppress competition and exclude competitors from the market. The best recent example of this was Mylan's EpiPen. Milan owned the patent on the automated messaging delivery system that the FDA required, and by requiring the self-instructing injection system the FDA created a monopoly on Epinephrine, which normally costs cents per dose.   Private businesses will always price gouge given the opportunity. A business' primary focus and responsibility is the generation of wealth for stakeholders. But to really take advantage of consumers, a market disruption must take place that eliminates the ability for others to compete. In the case of Healthcare, that's the FDA more often than not.  **Medicare and Medicaid**  In 1965 the US government dumped significant demand burden on our medical system (something like 30 million new covered users) while at the same time using its monopolistic buying power to effectively set price and quality in the marketplace. When the government is footing the bill, physician's fees go up and that percolates throughout the entire industry. Between 1965 and 1993, physicians fees increased 675% compared to 359% for all goods and services measured by the CPI. Currently, medical care inflates about twice as fast as the rest of the economy.  **Price Shielding**  While price shielding is (at least partially) a result/side-effect of both Employer-Based Insurance *and* Medicare/Medicaid, this is basically the only place I feel the government should add regulatory measures to protect competition. If you've ever had an MRI done, you know that the procedure comes first, and the explanation of benefits comes second. If you have a high deductible and want to pay out of pocket? Good luck shopping prices. Doctor's offices and hospitals literally will not tell you the difference between what you would pay in cash and what your insurance provider would pay on your behalf. Don't believe me? Call and ask. I've done it. It's a nightmare trying to get an answer. Medical care facilities should be required to post their pricing for procedures in ways that are easily accessible and visible to the general public so that everyone can shop price. This would immediately reduce costs as providers actually began to compete with one another.  &#x200B;  So, in conclusion, I don't trust the government to fix these problems which they themselves created through excessive regulatory burden and intervention in the free market",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-27T14:14:08,-1

If those people could have afforded (quality) health insurance in 1965, then Medicare and Medicaid wouldn't have been started.  >Price Shielding  Generally agree.  >So, in conclusion  [Let me leave you with this.](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Health_Care_Cost_as_Percentage_of_GDP.png)  Rising healthcare costs are not a uniquely American phenomenon, which means nominally increasing rates must be tied to something else. [For example, all of these countries are experiencing a large demographic shift](https://acl.gov/aging-and-disability-in-america/data-and-research/projected-future-growth-older-population#:~:text=Both%20populations%20are%20growing%2C%20and,3.1%20million%20to%2054.1%20million).  The U.S. has a higher rate of healthcare inflation, however. The higher rate can be easily attributed to poor health standards across the U.S. We are generally unhealthier, and we don't go to the doctor as often. We have also failed to create the medical infrastructure needed to cope with a massive, unhealthy boomer population clinging to life. There are obviously other reasons, but it's much harder to argue and reason those. With massive systems, Occam's razor typically wins out (i.e. the biggest contributor).  Additionally, these other countries typically have higher levels of government intervention, but they evidently spend less. Why?  Perhaps the problem is that the free market [will always naturally coagulate into monopolies or oligopolies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/porter.asp) unless acted on by external forces (government).  Perhaps insurance companies lack proper incentives because, at the end of the day, people will always pay whatever they negotiate with providers. Medical care is an inelastic good, and companies will always price gouge.  Perhaps Americans are [literally just afraid of the costs and the time commitment](https://www.norc.org/NewsEventsPublications/PressReleases/Pages/survey-finds-large-number-of-people-skipping-necessary-medical-care-because-cost.aspx) (away from our jobs), so we either allow problems to fester until we end up in the ER (very costly) or try to [solve the problem via an abusive prescription drug industry](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57772#:~:text=Nationwide%20spending%20on%20prescription%20drugs%20increased%20from%20%2430%20billion%20in,sevenfold%3A%20from%20%24140%20to%20%241%2C073) (or both).",[deleted],2022-09-28T11:17:22,1
"So what makes the regulator more trustworthy than the business owner?   And few offer services at lower prices because they will all be paid at higher ones. If the government will recompense you 10,000 for a simple surgery, why not charge what the patient can pay *plus* 10,000?

"Monopolies in healthcare occur more frequently at current because FDA regulations block competitors from the market. A great example of this happened with Mylan and the EpiPen.  On the flip side, when regulation is light and insurance companies refuse coverage of procedures (see LASIK) competitors flock to secure market share and do so by lowering their prices. LASIK was 20k an eye two decades ago, now it’s 2k for both. That’s competition.  The government shouldn’t be relied upon to be the solution to problems it caused.",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-27T10:45:38,0

"Progressive taxes mean regressive social policies  Regressive taxes mean progressive social policies  ----- The US has Progressive Taxes and the EU has Regressive taxes  > Much of the difference in relative tax burdens among different countries is due to the taxes that fund social-insurance programs, such as Social Security and Medicare in the U.S.   >These taxes tend to be higher in other developed nations than they are in the U.S. Take that married couple referred to above: In 21 of the 39 countries studied, they paid more in social-insurance taxes than in income taxes. The U.S. had the 11th-lowest social-insurance tax rate for such couples among the countries we examined.  [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/10/24/among-developed-nations-americans-tax-bills-are-below-average/)    >    US taxes are low relative to those in other developed countries (figure 1). In 2015, taxes at all levels of US government represented 26 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with an average of 33 percent for the 35 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  >    Among OECD countries, only Korea, Turkey, Ireland, Chile, and Mexico collected less than the United States as a percentage of GDP. Taxes exceeded 40 percent of GDP in seven European countries, including Denmark and France, where taxes were greater than 45 percent of GDP.

Taxes would definitely need to be increased in the United States if it were to adopt them.**If the U.S. were to raise taxes in a way that mirrors Scandinavian countries, taxes—especially on the middle-class—would increase through a new VAT and high payroll and income taxes**.

">Companies, on the surface, do not receive any special tax benefits.  I'm not talking about the companies receiving benefits. I'm talking about why people moved to employer-based coverage over private. [""Employer-paid premiums for health insurance are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes. Additionally, the portion of premiums employees pay is typically excluded from taxable income. The exclusion of premiums lowers most worker's tax bills and thus reduces their after-tax cost of coverage. This tax subsidy partly explains why most American families have health insurance coverage through employers.""](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-tax-exclusion-employer-sponsored-health-insurance-work)  When FDR froze wages, he forced businesses to get competitive in other ways. And then the government began incentivizing employer-based insurance through tax rewards. Again, this is a problem that was created by the government.  >Additionally, routine doctor visits and the occasional flu shot are not bankrupting the U.S. It doesn't matter if those are out-of-pocket or paid via insurance. Small-scope visits might make up most doctor visits, but they do not make up most of the total cost.  You have no evidence to support this claim. Medicare Part B costs the US more each year than Parts A, C or D. Why would we not assume that privatized health care spending follows suit?  >we have two choices. Either we further regulate the FDA to avoid that in the future or we get rid of the FDA  No, there is a third choice. Even Milton Friedman understood that the FDA serves a purpose. The problems started when the administration began regulating efficacy in addition to safety. The free market does a fine job regulating efficacy on its own, because consumers won't continually purchase worthless products and companies that sell sugar pills lose their market share.  >If those people could have afforded (quality) health insurance in 1965, then Medicare and Medicaid wouldn't have been started.  The clamor for a national healthcare system really got serious under JFK in the early 1960's, with the primary concern being for elderly people (65 and older) who did not have insurance because they were retired, had previously had insurance through their employer and were now being rejected for coverage because they were elderly. So again, these folks not having insurance is a symptom of the employer-based coverage system that was pushed by the government.   >So...we just shouldn't grant medical access to 30 (likely more now) million poor and old people?  Are you asking if I think the program should be abolished? The answer is yes. I think it should be phased out, but with plenty of forewarning and consideration for those who have not made alternative plans. If you want to keep Medicare in place, retain Part A, but at the very least Medicare Parts B and D should end. If the FDA's generic prescription drug review process and brand exclusivity periods were eliminated Part D would be completely unnecessary.   >Rising healthcare costs are not a uniquely American phenomenon, which means nominally increasing rates must be tied to something else  False. Basically every country on Earth is moving toward more socialized medical care. That leads to increased healthcare costs because government price controls are less effective than free market competition at driving down cost of goods and services.  >Additionally, these other countries typically have higher levels of government intervention, but they evidently spend less. Why?  Because they ration care, pay their healthcare professionals less, and as you mentioned, generally lead healthier lifestyles.  >Perhaps the problem is that the free market will always naturally coagulate into monopolies or oligopolies unless acted on by external forces (government).  This is laughably false, and the link you provided is non sequitur to the point you're making. Blended economies typically trend the direction you speak of because bad actors engage in political capitalism (which is definitionally not the same as free market capitalism). Government intervention, cronyism and corporatism all thrive when the government meddles.  >Medical care is an inelastic good, and companies will always price gouge  A good or service being considered inelastic is meaningless as long as there is competition. Gasoline is an inelastic good and you can usually buy it for $3 a gallon. That's because producers and providers compete with one another in the marketplace. If you eliminate price shielding, consumers could do the same with medical care.  Again, government *IS* the problem. They are the root cause of nearly every problem with the United States' current health care system. More government is not the solution.",BirthdaySalt5791,2022-09-28T15:34:40,1
