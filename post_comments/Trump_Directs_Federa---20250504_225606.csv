"Just some hard facts here:  1) Alcatraz was closed in 1963.  2) Alcatraz was built in 1934 and it hasn't been renovated or modernized since then. The electricity was upgraded but the piping, prison system, and administration facilities are beyond obsolete.   3) There would be high risk management in bringing prisoners to a tourist area let alone trucking, and infrastructure would be a nightmare as the area if over crowded with tourists.  4) It's extremely small compared to other modern prisons.",Throwawayiea,2025-05-05T00:28:54,19

Emergency transportation to a hospital, so a helicopter and landing space. Probably more than one, but maybe that could be on standby on the mainland.   Are there laws protecting Alcatraz as a historical site? It‚Äôs part of a national park.  What will be the impact to the local wildlife/ecosystem in the surrounding waters?

"[This is the most optimistic way](https://www.270towin.com/2026-senate-election/Mld8xJ) I can look at the 2026 Senate map. How do you get the 13 additional Democrats needed to remove Trump?  All you need for an impeachment is 218 votes in the House. They could theoretically get that before the Midterms *if* Trump is bad enough. But that doesn't mean anything without 67 votes to convict and remove in the Senate.  EDIT: Oops, Maine should be blue on a totally optimistic map.
