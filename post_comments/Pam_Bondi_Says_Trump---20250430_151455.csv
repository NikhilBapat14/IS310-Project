Those are some North Korea levels of mental gymnastics.  Based on the cuts specifically to critical funding for food and other aid programs there would likely be more people alive if he had simply done literally nothing.,Serenity867,2025-04-30T15:17:51,55
It's true. I was heading out to my local drug store to buy some fentanyl and it was all sold out!,grantrules,2025-04-30T15:16:16,19
"The whole regime is absurd and criminal ( I'm not even sure where to start with CSAM Twitter guy Dom Lucre having a spot in the press pool https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lo2k6coxgh26), but seriously, watching that moment, Bondi lies that 258 million people have been saved because of fentanyl seizures under Trump, which according to a post by her yesterday, amounts to 22 million laced pills.

"Okay, that is 71% of the entire population.

"Ohhh, I figured this out. Took a second. They took the amount of fentanyl they seized, looked up the lowest dose that could kill someone who has no tolerance, assumed all the fentanyl was pure, and then assumed that it would be divided between 258 million people who would each buy just enough to kill themselves and then take it all at once.",pervocracy,2025-04-30T15:42:02,6
