"> the garnishment of wages; and the confiscation of savings and personal property, including homes and vehicles.  Fantastic. It's not enough to ruin people's lives, now we're going to ruin them *and* take everything they've earned through their labor. Because of course.   > deputizing and contracting with State and local law enforcement officers, former Federal officers, officers and personnel within other Federal agencies, **and other individuals** to increase the enforcement and removal operations  Other individuals. This is where the tacticool ICE bros come in. Cops are bad enough, but at least they get some training. Deputizing random bounty hunters and dudes that played one too many FPS video games definitely won't cause any problems for anyone, right?

Wait a tick…what country is gonna take an undocumented person without a passport for entry into the receiving country?  Would people exit the US and be denied entry into the arrival country and not be able to return to US?,animalslover4569,2025-05-10T03:38:51,25
The Germans did this to the Jews early on when Jews still had the opportunity to leave. They had to basically hand over 90% of their assets and savings to flee voluntarily. It's messed up.,bananastand512,2025-05-10T07:52:33,7

">Would people exit the US and be denied entry into the arrival country and not be able to return to US?  *Correct*.  What is being offered here is the ""not our problem""-deal. They are going to make a few deals with some countries - and not the nice, democratic kind - that will accept flights. They will put you on the flight, have you go to that country (not the one of your choice!) and then you are stuck there, relying on the embassy of whatever your country of origin is to sort things out.  This isn't some sort of superb kindness. It's a scam to get you into the plane *without* any documentation so that once you have landed in the destination country, you have *zero* paperwork to show you came from the US.  And even assuming you arrive in your destination country: how are you going to cash in the ""reward"" being offered *after* leaving the US without paperwork? Do you have any proof you came from the US? Do you think you have enough judiciary leeway to force home office to pay when they don't? Do you think an administration who's head is famous for breaking contracts is gonna *actually* pay you once you're gone...?  The stipulation is that you cash in the reward *after* successful return. Alright, pray tell, what are you going to do if they shrug their shoulders and just refuse to pay? Have a Venezuelan court sue the Trump administration? And if your argument is ""they will probably pay because..."", I have three words for you:  *Donald. J. Trump*.",BCMakoto,2025-05-10T10:52:36,1

It's one thing to kick someone out of your country. But to steal their assets that they worked hard for is just so fucking LOW. It's definitely Nazi shit.,Frickin_Brat,2025-05-10T07:54:06,4
"The soviet union did this too. My in laws left as political refugees from a soviet controlled country in the 70s. They could leave, but only with one suitcase each , no valuables except a wedding ring, the equivalent of about a hundred dollars.  Their house that was family owned for generations and any valuables were taken by the state.  They gave away anything valuable to friends before they left.",Designer-Contract852,2025-05-10T08:52:47,3
"Just for the record, the US will not permit entry of a citizen without documentation; you must have a Passport of an ID with a photo issued by the State or Federal office.  If you are under 15, and traveling with the parent, you can use the CBRA in some circumstances.  So if we don’t take our own citizens back without documentation, why on Earth would any other country take a person without “appropriate travel documentation”?  Edit: Will admit most of my knowledge here comes from having a daughter born overseas, if there is an actual Gov website to reference I would welcome learning more.",animalslover4569,2025-05-10T06:06:10,9

That is not correct.  A US Citizen cannot be denied entry into the United States. You will certainly be held while record checks and whatnot are done but if they cannot show that you're not a citizen you will be allowed in.  I work in immigration.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-10T07:14:30,3
