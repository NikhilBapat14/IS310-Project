"Honestly, we can bitch and moan all day that this should have happened a long time ago -- and it should have -- but instead of letting the ""it's not good enough energy"" take over, we should be using whatever small nuggets of momentum we can take to push back against this regime. And this is one of those.",RoyalPlush3,2025-04-07T10:31:54,192

"So many salty people complaining about it needed to be done sooner. True. But we can't change the damn past so the second best time to start is now. We can either be bummed about the history or coalesce and start building the future. The GOP wins shit because when push comes to shove, literal white supremacists and Christians support the same party in the voting booth. Wild to think, but that's what's happening. So keep that in mind next time you're fighting your fellow Dems over something.  Oh and all this is happening because people are shouting in the streets, calling their reps, and generally causing a ruckus. That's how shit gets done - always has, always will.",MattyBeatz,2025-04-07T10:47:07,36

"I was thinking this for the better part of ""when the maga/gop"" released project 2025 and it was revealed the heritage foundation ""A CONSERVATIVE THINK TANK"" was behind the lion's share along with other conservative ""think tanks"" with their input. I thought surely there must be some ""DEM,LIBERAL/PROGRESSIVE"" think tanks that are also in operation they just haven't broadcast because they are working behind the scenes - no fanfare just get the job done!  And I thought I'm not some mover and shaker, some popular streamer, someone with a voice that will be heard, just stay in your lane and let those in charge do their thing ...  So over 5+ years later these buffoons decide to ANNOUNCE they are launching a ""WAR ROOM"" ... after they/we lost an election because of tepidness and inaction ...  I just can't!
