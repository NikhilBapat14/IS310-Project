"Trump is a terrible negotiator. He‚Äôs inconsistent, can‚Äôt hold the line and bends depending on who he speaks to.  Speaks to Putin, it‚Äôs all about Russia. Now he talks to Zelensky, Russia bad.  He‚Äôll hear from Putin within the week and Ukraine will be wrong again.",jediporcupine,2025-04-26T18:00:08,27
"We all know what's going to happen next.

And then he'll have a phone call with Putin and attack Zelenskyy again.  It's like he's got memory loss and just believes the last person he speaks to for a brief amount of time. Zero integrity when it comes to sticking to any sort of solid opinion on the matter. He just wants to end the war as quick as possible so he can claim credit and try and make some beneficial mineral deals off the back of it too. He couldn't give a rats arse about anything else.,Rem4g,2025-04-27T07:46:58,1
"I think the ""Krasnov"" liberals are going to have to face the fact that they are making a very specific claim that has little evidence.      Trump is very stupid and always looks at things simplistically until reality hits him. Remember how he doesn't even know what a trade deficit is. It may be that he usually takes the side of Russia just because some pro-Russia guy in his orbit is nice to him.",PikachuStatue,2025-04-26T23:51:29,0

"Empty promises is his MO. Remember all his promises when he was only a candidate? You  who believed him, don't you feel like a fool now? Many warned you! Now how to begin to repair the damage.

">  I doubt it amounts to much  It's a funeral. For the Pope. A funeral is not a hard concept to understand. You show up wearing black and keep quite and don't do business deals and you don't shake down foreign governments that your own government said they would protect.  How many times has Trump been golfing since he was elected this time? Trump was at his golf course on the 24th and will back at his other golf course the 27th.
