"A conservative federal judge ordered the certification of Justice Allison Riggs's election, which rejects months of Republicans' machinations via baseless lawsuits to try to damage due process and equal protection rights of the affected residents in North Carolina.  Snippet:  >For six long months, Jefferson Griffin and his Republican allies have attacked lawful North Carolina voters through baseless lawsuit after baseless lawsuit, in an attempt to steal a Supreme Court seat from the rightful winner, Justice Allison Riggs. Today, a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump ordered the certification of Justice Allison Riggs’ election, rejecting months of Republicans machinations to “change the rules of the game after it had been played.”  >**In response, DNC Chair Ken Martin issued the following statement:**  >>“Today’s order from a Trump-appointed chief U.S. District Court judge must bring an end – once and for all – to Republicans’ attempts to overturn a free and fair election and disenfranchise lawful North Carolina voters months after they cast their ballots. Allison Riggs won this election. Today’s decision is a victory for the tens of thousands of North Carolinians targeted by disgraced candidate Jefferson Griffin and Republicans in suit after baseless suit. It’s a victory for voters across the state. Since November 2024, the nation has watched the North Carolina Supreme Court race, dreading the ramifications for our democracy should Republicans prevail in their scheme to steal an election. People decide elections – not politicians. Today, a Trump-appointed judge confirmed what North Carolinians have known since Election Day: Justice Allison Riggs belongs on the state Supreme Court as voters already decided in the 2024 election.”",progress18,2025-05-06T05:42:08,11
I don’t know the DNC had a “War Room” team. Is this new? Have they made any previous statements? It seems to me the silence from most of democrats in Congress should be addressed.,JohnnyDigsIt,2025-05-06T10:54:30,2
