"It would be a Biden economy if Trump had just taken the reigns in a business-as-usual manner. Instead, Trump implemented Draconian tariffs, blew up uncertainty, and pissed off our allies, all while gutting a lot of government agencies (jobs).   Remember guys, while the president doesn’t have an “economy goes up” button, he sure as hell can drive us off of the tracks.  Edit: typo",berninger_tat,2025-04-30T18:19:43,555
"Inflation was bad. Trump only produces good outcomes. In fact, Republicans never do anything wrong according to their voters. Like when Biden signed that divisive program for women in the military into law while Trump was president in 2017. Fortunately, Pete Hegseth got rid of that program that Biden enacted when Trump was president. It was kind of like when Obama signed into law the bank bailout while George W. Bush was president. Or when Bill Clinton didn’t stop 9/11 when Bush was president. Or when Biden initiated a nationwide lockdown when Trump was president.",Randy_Watson,2025-04-30T18:24:22,202
"It’s important to point out that the Democratic Party had a majority in the House in 2020 and were instrumental in getting those provisions to Americans.

"Trump‘s.  Normally, there’s a degree to which the previous administrations actions, to the extent that presidential administrations deeply shaped the economy in the short term, are inherited by the next administration.  So Clinton inherited GHWB and GWB inherited Clinton’s and so on so forth.   But there are major events that can occur that up end that narrative. One could argue that GWB inherited a decent economy from Clinton and then 9/11 happens and it wasn’t either Clinton or GWB‘s economy.  Not looking to get pedantic about whether or not GWB should have stopped 9/11.  But what’s going on right now. This is all Trump. He inherited an economy that had issues. Many Americans were upset about but was a post Covid economy that recovered better than basically everybody else in the world. A soft landing was executed and while there’s still some inflation concerns, things were in pretty good shape.  The chaos of all of Trump‘s actions, not just the tariffs, immediately destabilized things. And then the tariffs ping-ponging around based on his whims sent everything into chaos. This is the case in which the president took actions that immediately made what was already happening in the economy irrelevant and the impact was immediate and directly caused by those actions.  This is the rare case where what’s happening in the economy is 100% down to a president and his administration",ButGravityAlwaysWins,2025-04-30T19:09:19,11

I think it’s fair to say that Trumps tariff and trade policies have taken over as the main factor in the economy - it’s one man harming the economy.

"I happened to be in a macro economics class as the Presidency switched.  We spent several weeks comparing and contrasting the two plans.  Generally I hate economics in college, but those few weeks were really interesting.   Overall, we determined that Trump's was both too small and all the extras (the $7 million spent on a letter to say ""I did that"") and too slow (because of the letter) hurt the already wounded economy, where Biden's was probably about $100 too much, but was otherwise right on.  We predicted a steady rise in inflation because of the two together, with it capping and then, hopefully, other actions to bring it back down.

"Unfortunately, the question you're asking, or more correctly, the way you're asking it, sane washes much of what Trump is doing and has done. It's like saying both kids messed up the playroom, so they're equally guilty of the mess that was made, when one kid left out a few toys and the other threw a tantrum, dumped Legos on the floor, smeared feces on the wall, and then told you to fuck yourself.  Let me explain it this way. Trump gave the economy a quick injection and sent it back out the door without addressing the real issues. Biden, on the other hand, was working on something that had been allowed to go on too long and was poorly done, making it a harder fix.  A good example is the poor handling of the situation by Trump was the PPP loans. They were rampant with fraud, and even when proven, very little was done about it. Even if not outright fraudulent, many companies broke the terms related to getting the loans forgiven yet still had those loans forgiven. It was one of the biggest cash grabs by the wealthy in the history of the US since Bush bailed out the banks for nothing in return. We will see far worse.  Short version; Trump gave us a stop gap, Biden gave us a full solution.",ManElectro,2025-04-30T20:12:09,1
"Inflation was a predictable outcome of both policies. What really accelerated it was the Federal Reserve’s emergency liquidity injections to prevent mass credit defaults.  That totalled $4.8 trillion. More than both the stimulus packages combined. It drove real rates deeply negative, making money essentially free, and led to the 2020-21 everything bubble.  This bubble has been much more damaging than people realise. The euphoria and subsequent wealth effect of that bubble massively increased the overall sentiment and velocity of money. Households that owned assets at the time would’ve made much more money from price appreciation of those assets than the any of the stimulus checks.  Don’t get me wrong, the stimulus directly introduced a positive demand shock at a time when there was a negative supply shock. But structural, embedded inflation needs more than an impulse, it needs asset price inflation. Which is what we got well after the stimulus checks came in.  Whose economy is it? Jerome Powell’s.",k3t4mine,2025-04-30T20:19:17,1

"As I see it, the president is four years, the sad fact is that all economic plans vary sometimes they hit hard very fast, or they take time. Because of this diversity. I usually consider the first year of the new president to be a part of the outcome of the prior administration.   However, things have changed due to covid, affecting two presidents. The Final part of Trump and the Biden, So truthfully it affected two presidents so I would say it would take two presidents to fix all the problems of the pandemic Sadly there are still effects due to this pandemic, there are still shortages of some goods like medicine.     Trump with his tariffs are a factor too. Trump is playing a risky game. Tariffs in the short term is damaging but not deadly to the economy. But in the long term, they can be deadly. They can affect the stock market.   So to be fair, some of this is the outcome of Biden, but the effects are delayed due to covid. But trump is not helping things out with his tariffs, He better start finalizing some negotiations soon, and show that these tariffs are worth it. Otherwise he will be screwed in the midterms",ChemistryFan29,2025-04-30T23:24:25,1
"Trump will always take credit for good news even if he had nothing to do with it. Trump will also never accept responsibility for bad news, even if he caused it directly.  Trump inherited a strong economy with good growth, low unemployment and low inflation, and a record stock market. He implemented tariffs and caused massive economic uncertainty that has now caused a recession. Of course he won't take responsibility, of course he would blame Biden.  ""When I win, I will immediately bring prices down,"" Trump said during the campaign.  Now, 100 days later, prices are skyrocketing. Of course Trump blames Biden.  edit: we are just at the beginning of Trump's economy. There is plenty of time for it to get worse, as most economists say it will.

Because it's called ""politics"" and you always blame everyone other than you if you can get away with it because most voters are not rational discerning people, and instead cast their votes according to the party the candidate is from.  Asking why Trump hypocritically blames Biden for decisions taken in office is not an interesting question, nor is there an interesting discussion to be had in my opinion.  The more interesting question is why did over half of American voters believe him or ignore it.",Kitchner,2025-05-01T09:57:42,1
"Both stimulus checks were about a month's rent, I think it's completely off base to say that was the reason for years worth of inflation. There was a global supply shock from the start stop nature of the pandemic, and when things opened up again those who didn't lose their jobs had money saved, both from shut down cut backs like vacation and restaurant budgets, and from saving expecting a crash. People came out of the pandemic with a lot of money, with the supply side still not able to keep up with demand. As the money started to get tighter and the supply chain back to full capacity, companies still wanted growth from those years of people willing to pay more. Those they just kept pushing, and it never got bad enough for people to say ""that's too much I'll go without""   That was the economy during the Biden admin in a nutshell. Presidents can do a bit to steer the economy,  but it's mostly market forces, buys and sellers trying to get the best deal they can for themselves.  That brings us to now though, in which the new supply shock is tariff policy companies didn't have warning to account for. An effective 10% sales tax on all imports, sometimes payed multiple times if the supply chain goes into America and then back out. This is a major economic event that disrupts commerce globally, and we can draw a direct line to Trump. So when normally we can say the economy is way bigger then the President, that's not the case here.",robynh00die,2025-05-01T11:45:42,1

"The main issue is that the fed is slow to recognize inflation. This, Biden took the blame for Trump’s runaway inflation.   This is for a number of reasons. The biggest reason is the fed wants to have a measured response and doesn’t want to be too reactionary. They could easily drive our economy into a death spiral if they reacted too quickly or drastically.   Also, the supply chain means consumers feel inflation long after it happens. Demand goes up and stresses the demand on raw materials. Raw materials go up, and give manufacturers 30 days notice at worst. Manufacturers raise prices as a response and contractually have to give their customers 30-90 days notice. Distributors and manufacturers also buy at the lower price as much as possible to load up on the lower priced goods. This means it can take 6 months to a year for consumers to feel the pain of a price increase. I was the head of pricing for a major manufacturer in 2020-2023. In 2020 and early 2021 we had a total on NINE double digit price increases to our distributors. By 6 months into Biden’s office, we had started to see prices starting to stabilize. Consumers didn’t really feel that until about 2023/2024. By then consumers were pissed and there was no convincing them the economy had stabilized.",Lutya,2025-05-01T15:15:50,1

His botching of Covid led partly to 1 million American deaths and worldwide inflation. He basically fucked the world, but he got a pass for some reason that is beyond me.   He had the same opportunity this time around, as Biden had finally cleaned up his Covid mess and turned over an economy with shrinking inflation, low unemployment, impressive GDP growth and a booming stock market. Trump then implemented a ton of bad economic policy through executive orders, and managed to absolutely fuck up the world's best economy in a little over three months.   Had he done nothing, we would be fine. And he could have taken credit like he did in his first term. But he did something, and every time Trump does something -- ANYTHING -- he fucks everything up.

"In 2015, the movie “Our Brand Is Crisis” included a quote that holds deep truth for me: “If voting changed anything, they’d make it illegal.”  From a psychological perspective, it makes sense to tell someone to vote. It says: “You have been heard. You have power. If your side loses, at least you did your best. Good game.”  But you cannot go door to door and ask millions of people how they voted — so how do you know any election outcome is truly legitimate? You trust a news agency to report the truth, but those agencies are owned by individuals with agendas.  Is it possible the presidential election has already been decided — that the person placed in office was hired for that specific role and told what to say and do, thereby enacting a predetermined agenda?  This is what your comment reminds me of: business as usual.  On the surface, it seems like things are changing with every executive action. But are they? If you are wealthy, you will never have to worry about owning a gun, immigrating to another country, having an abortion, getting excellent health care, etc.   And if things are not changing for everyone, then they are staying the same. To me, this is where the terms “Democrat” and “Republican” come in. By getting people to turn against one another through prejudice and tribalism, the finger is never pointed at the person behind the curtain. And this means the money will continue to flow. Your money. Your taxes.   You cannot walk up to someone on the street and take their money, otherwise they will rebel. But if you do it under the guise of legitimacy, they will comply.   In my eyes, voting works very much the same way.

Combine that with producers having sick workers, that started the ball rolling.  That the floored Biden, whom didn't want to talk about it and tried to pretend it didn't happen.

"You are forgetting that, despite the rhetoric against it, Democrats didn’t touch the corporate tax rate in 2021 & 2022 when they had full power to reverse it.  The truth was shown in their actions there and not in their words.  They knew it was good and didn’t want to mess with a good thing under their watch.  Research has shown that cut actually lead to a 20% increase in corporate investment which has huge longterm benefits:  >We have five main findings. First, the TCJA caused domestic investment of firms with the mean tax change to increase by roughly 20% relative to firms experiencing no tax change.  https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f191672.pdf  A main benefit of that would be low unemployment as investing in more employees is a quick and easy investment to make.  That in turn increased the tax base to greatly increase revenue.  That claim above that the debt ballooned from decreased revenue is absolutely false as shown in this dataset from the CBO’s Budget Outlook Report:  https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61172#_idTextAnchor008  Not only did revenue reach a historical high rate of 19% of GDP in 2022, but it is settling in at 18.3% for the next decade when the historical average is 17.3% of GDP. That 1% improvement might not seem like much, but when the historical average for the deficit is 3.8% of GDP for the last half century it is a major improvement. Unfortunately Biden and the Democrat trifecta in 2021 & 2022 nearly doubled the deficit as it is set to be 6.1% of GDP for the next decade despite the improved revenue.  That deficit ballooned from Biden’s “Spend Big” policies that has spending going to 24.4% of GDP when the historical average is 21.1% of GDP.  I put that in quotes as the Biden administration infamously proclaimed that with their crazy high budgets:  >President Biden on Friday unveiled an historically large $6 trillion 2022 budget, making his case to Congress that **now is the time for America to spend big.** > >Mr. Biden's proposed budget for fiscal year 2022 surpasses former President Trump's proposed budget last year of $4.8 trillion, and comes after trillions the U.S. has already spent to battle the dual health and economic crises brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.  > >Budget projections show a $6 trillion price tag is **just the beginning**, with spending steadily increasing each year until the budget reaches $8.2 trillion in 2031.  https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-budget-6-trillion-proposal-2022/  Unfortunately spend big policies also means big inflation.  Glad to see with this topic that people now seem to finally realize that.  Just in case you need more convincing here is MIT research that shows the surging inflation was overwhelmingly caused by that excessive spending.  https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/federal-spending-was-responsible-2022-spike-inflation-research-shows",Fargason,2025-05-01T13:15:23,-5

The government was just handing out money for free.  That's what caused inflation at least partly. Also I don't really trust their analysis. If you look at for example the largest egg producer in the usa, their gross profits increased more than 3x compared to last year. This inflation was just price gouging.   Regarding debt, trump ballooned the debt more than anyone before him, but without getting anything for it. He lost jobs over the course of his presidency. Biden tried to tackle the massive problem we have in this country of our infrastructure crumbling.  I think it was in Montana alone there are more than 500 bridges that will reach the end of their projected life span in the next five years. Trump just gave tax breaks to the rich.

"Did you?  Care to quote the relevant text where MIT “specifically blames trumps spending during covid for the inflation” spike?  I definitely don’t see anything like that.  Keep in mind Democrats controlled the House during COVID and took advantage of the crisis to drastically increase spending which we know now was highly inflationary.  Like when Senate Republicans proposed a $650 billion relief package and House Democrats countered with actually passing a $3.4 trillion plan.  >“Since that time, my members will attest, the needs have only grown since May 15, four months ago,” Pelosi said, **referring to the day Democrats passed their own sprawling $3.4 trillion package**. “The needs for the small businesses, for the restaurants, for transportation and the rest.” > >And **Senate Republicans have shown no appetite for moving beyond the $650 billion relief package they tried to push through the Senate last week**, which was rejected by Democrats as woefully inadequate to meet the health care and economic crises facing the United States.  https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/17/coronavirus-stimulus-deal-417142  The CBO dataset above also shows Obama increasing the debt more than Trump/Pelosi did as he had many years of excessive spending and record low revenue while Trump had 3 years of spending below the historical average before COVID.  If that isn’t enough then here is an AP fact check:  >CLAIM: Trump “ran up more debt than any other President in American history.” > >AP’S ASSESSMENT: That’s incorrect.
