ha ha ha of course trump wore a blue suit to a funeral     EDIT: I just saw a clip on Air Force 1 on his way over there - he was wearing a black suit  He must've spilled ketchup all over it or shat his pants or vomited up his hamberder on it so he had to change to the ill-fitting uglyass blue suit.,ElPlywood,2025-04-26T08:21:59,28
It isn't a talk if one side is unwilling to take into account the idea of the other side.  It's more like an announcement.,thieh,2025-04-26T08:20:34,5

"He got the memo, just couldn’t read it. Meanwhile, Melania looking particularly dour because Justin wasn’t there.   I’m sure this meeting was at Trump’s insistence. Wants to look all powerful and peacemaker. Always has to draw focus to himself.",Actual-Reference3125,2025-04-26T14:33:17,1
"Love or hate Catholicism, maybe this is a good idea, more peace talks at the Vatican. Neutral ground.   What's infuriating is when I agree with Trump, he's stated more than once, he's against people dying.   Just trying to point out something positive.",ForwardLavishness320,2025-04-26T20:31:12,1
