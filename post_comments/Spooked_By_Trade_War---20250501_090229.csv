"***From Rolling Stone’s Asawin Suebsaeng:***  *Some Trump administration officials are stockpiling toilet paper and food before Trump’s tariffs cause prices to skyrocket.*  Donald Trump’s trade wars with China and other nations are widely expected to cause sharp economic pain, but some experts have warned consumers not to hoard supplies and goods before prices skyrocket, arguing that mass stockpiling could backfire spectacularly.  Well, many Americans aren’t listening to that advice, according to survey data this year, instead preparing for the possibility of store shelves being bare amid a Trump-inflicted recession. Funnily enough, this includes a number of government officials and staffers working directly for the man who launched these massive new trade wars, all on the grounds of bad tariff math and the flimsy premise that he would bring economic “liberation” to America and make the country “wealthy again.”  Two Trump administration officials and a Trump aide tell Rolling Stone that they have done some stockpiling of their own in recent weeks or months, and that they know others working in Republican politics — inside and outside of the administration — who are doing the same. One of the Trump officials says they have already run to Target to bulk-buy toilet paper, some types of food, and other household supplies.

"Lots, we import raw soft wood pulp. But we can get that pulp locally as well. Unfortunately for our current situation toilet paper is 70% hardwood pulp. Pulp that is a by product of hardwood dimensional lumber production.   The US does not have a healthy local hardwood lumber industry. You can't find it on the shelves in bulk, it's sold in specialty shops and through local millers. We don't have a commodity market locally. Because we don't build with hardwood. It's a catch-22, you can't buy oak framing boards in the US (as you can in most of europe) so no one builds with it.   The companies that produce hardwood in the US primarily supply large cabinet and moulding suppliers, and use the excess pulp for their own engineered wood products.  So yes, we produce toilet paper here. But 75% of the hardwood pulp is imported from south america and europe. And while going to less rain forest production for TP would be a great thing, this isn't a supply chain you can flip over in less than half a year.",darkfred,2025-05-01T17:15:49,1

"That a governor put his own state first and was willing to take on the Feds and his own party to do. I’m not championing Hogan by any means; I think he is a false centrist who tried to take up that moniker to get ahead while not actually being centrist (fuck No Labels).   My point in my call out is that if your goal is to continue driving a wedge among Americans, by all means, continue to vilify half the country. You will guarantee the exact same outcome and the exact same deadlocked legislature where no one can so much as consider reaching across the aisle for fear of being denounced as a traitor to their party.   If instead you want to get the country off of high center and vote out all the pieces of shit destroying it in favor of personal greed and corporate control (of which there are plenty on BOTH sides of the aisle), you have to actually win some damn elections. You don’t win elections by isolating roughly half of the country by letting them know that regardless of their personal beliefs, their association immediately makes them evil. Instead you extend a hand and show a willingness to have open discourse so that they can walk into your tent. If you shut the door, they can’t decide to walk in and vote for you.   People who do not see an off ramp when confronted with a mistaken ideal will damn near always dig in rather than capitulating. By keeping the rhetoric vitriolic, you pretty much guarantee they will never acknowledge their mistake, be willing to listen to your point of view, or change their position. In effect, the vitriol itself locks them into their position.   Feels like im an old man screaming into the void at this point but damned if I won’t keep trying.
