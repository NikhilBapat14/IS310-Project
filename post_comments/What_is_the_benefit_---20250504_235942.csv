"When I was in college I actually took a class all about federalism and the shifting powers of state vs federal authority. The biggest argument I’ve found for it is the “laboratory of democracy” concept. Basically the idea is that one state can enact a policy, perfect example being legal weed. Then other states can look at it and go “how did that program work?”. If it’s successful it can be adopted elsewhere, maybe even federally. If not the damage of a bad policy is limited to one state.",Michael70z,2025-05-06T11:16:50,4
"States were supposed to be exactly what the name implies: independent states. The last paragraph of the Declaration of Independence states, ""*We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America ... solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States.*"" The federal government was to have very limited powers and states were intended to be sovereign, for all intents and purposes.  That went out the window after the Civil War and numerous interpretations of the 14th Amendment expanding federal jurisdiction over state affairs. To have states made more sense prior to the legal changes that occurred after 1865.  Whether it would be better to eliminate states depends on your political prerogative. If you favor local control, states and federalism make sense; if you favor a unified national government, then states are an anachronism.",Flapjack_Jenkins,2025-05-06T04:34:51,6
Who would have jurisdiction over the vast parts of the country with insufficient local population to manage it?,rearl306,2025-05-06T07:24:31,2
"Different layers for different issues.  For a country as diverse in geography and people, the lower levels can focus on more local issues while not having to worry about national issues.   For example, the federal government should be in charge of national defense for the whole nation.  But states can cater to their population for local laws that suit them better.  For example, Virginia has a whole section of its Constitution to oyster beds because it's a coastal state.  I don't know this for sure but I'm pretty sure Arizona does not.",MonarchLawyer,2025-05-06T14:56:59,2
"Generally, states are intended to address regional matters. Not large enough to concern a federal government, but too large for city governments.   Of course, when state lines are somewhat arbitrary, this distinction does become somewhat inefficient. For that reason, I would suggest that the United States (and maybe Canada) consolidate their states into states that are actually representative of modern realities instead of what historically made up their borders.   This would return states to being the true regional governments that they are supposed to be. Dealing with matters in ways that work best for their geography, economy, and population. Right now they are mostly just lines on a map, not true regions of the country.   There's no reason Rhode Island needs to be its own state in the 21st century. Both Dakota's share extremely similar interests. Conversely, something like Washington State and Oregon have very different concerns depending on which side of the Rockies you're talking about and it's a little odd that they're in one state apiece.   My point is, the regional interest purpose that is behind states existing... Doesn't really exist. So it's understandable that you question the point of them. Generally however, the idea is that people living on the west coast are different, with different priorities and expectations from their government, than people on the east coast, or the southern coast or the Midwest.",notpoleonbonaparte,2025-05-06T11:14:44,3

"Government is based on context and scope. You start small, you pay for small things. But then something happens where it's like we'll this is a city issue but it requires more money or intellect than we have locally, so all of a sudden you have reasons to support a broader government because there are things that require state sized governments and taxes together done. Then you have something like a war and all of a sudden there's a lot of money and management required and it makes sense to have a bunch of states band together to generate the money and management necessary for that. That only had to happen once. After that, the government has to vote itself away, and that rarely happens.",drdildamesh,2025-05-06T22:08:51,1
"Actually two levels would be inefficient due to the size of the country and the diversity of the geography and economies. Pragmatically, you need regional governance to address the needs of each region, so if you had just a federal level, you'd still need separate departments dealing with the specific needs of coastal, mountain, plains, etc., because one size really doesn't fit all.

"Laws are formalized customs & best practices suited to a domain.  That is why there are city laws, country laws, laws of the land, laws of the sea and law of the wild (or jungle).  The US covers a large portion of the N American continent covering a dizzying array of geographical environments.  Parceling out this landscape will allow local jurisdictions to create rules that work best in the local context. For example desert areas may have strict rules about the ownership and use of limit water resources whereas this is not necessary in wet environments.  So state governments create laws that work best for the domain they administer whereas the federal government focuses on national defense, national road system, international rules, national benefit programs and generally not get involved in legal administration unless it has interstate implications.",MrMathamagician,2025-05-06T23:11:15,1

"The federal level can better fund and procure garbage collection, primarily due to economics of scale.    However, if the federal Congress had to debate everytime an individual wanted a change in garbage pick-up days, it would never get anything done. Or whether a locality wanted to change the pay rate for their local garbage collectors or collection company all together, then Congress would get nothing done.   Apply that concept to every little thing that localities handle and suddenly the need for them becomes clear.   More layers are warranted when the current ones cannot either keep up with the logistical demands of politics or not granular enough to address people's concerns.   As for States?

"> about having more representation  Doesn't really work out that way. I'm a liberal in SC currently and all of my representation is being eliminated by the state government. Republicans abuse the system to gerrymander districts and things like that which mean I get no representation at the federal level - I get a ""representative"" who does the opposite of what I want. Then they do the same on the state level so my state legislature is not representing me either.   In fact, they don't even represent the conservative voters who do vote for them.   In many red states, the voters have passed ballot measures recently which red state legislatures have just kind of overruled - they change the rules *after* the people vote, meaning the people don't get what they voted for. Same happens with elected officials, like in NC where voters gave a Democrat the powers that the governor has - only for the gerrymandered state legislature to change the rules after the election to take away all the power they could from the governor and give it to some low level republican.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-06T18:29:12,0

"Even when you can see how things are going right now? It seems like the current federal situation demonstrates the importance of the states. Even when a few people have wild objectives, most state governments better represent, help, and protect their people. Even when there are swings, the swings are often less bad. This political party has gotten some of the most votes ever, The last party got some of the most votes ever in the last election. Just giving them both more power seem like a good fantasy?   Many states add protections, rights, and regulations. Good ones often spread to other states and the federal level. Almost like the implemention of good law is one of the best ways to get others to agree.   Right now, without the state: abortion would probably be illegal nationwide, higher health regulations would be gone (doctors, food, water, or air), LGBTQ rights would probably be a few steps behind if not illegal. Imagine before the Civil War if states _couldn't_ outlawed slavery. That same sort of progressivism is still happening now. The U.S. would probably be several steps back in many areas without the states to help set the example: Food regulation, clean air, and clean water.

"IIRC (it's been a while since i lived in New York) the Town provided most day-to-day services like police, water, roads, trash, etc. A village might form if you wanted specific individual control of something like zoning or police, while passing other services up to the Town.  The county primarily did the courts and the jails and the county sheriff, who again handled the courts and jails. When I left, my county had just started numbering ""county routes"" that I guess were either maintained by the county, or the county reimbursed the towns. I don't remember if we had a single county 911 system, or if each town/village had its own, but the county coordinated mutual aid.
