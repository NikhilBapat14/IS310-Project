"People act like ""the church and state don't agree on what is important"" is some novel idea instead of literally how everything worked prior to modern democracies deciding to be fairly hands off with religion.   Priests have been in tons of situations over the last thousand years where they had to decide between being arrested or excommunicated. The state expects them to accept excommunication, and the church expects them to accept arrest. Might not seem fair but that's the reality of living under two sets of laws that don't always agree.

In fact, there are studies that demonstrate that the faith community is even more vulnerable to abuse than secular environments. The Abel and Harlow study revealed that **93% of sex offenders describe themselves as “religious”** and that this category of offender may be the most dangerous.

Thus foregoing earthly punishment in exchange for eternal punishment. If your primary directive is ""saving souls"" then this is obviously counter productive.  At the same time, basically every other occupation requires you to report such crimes, including lawyers, who otherwise are bound by confidentiality and cannot discuss what their clients tell them with authorities.

"Aaaahhahahahaa   > stop characterising my distaste for people who are unwilling to accept science, logic, and reason   Georges LaMâitre, who discovered the big bang, was a Catholic priest. The Catholic church still operates one of the 5 largest observatories in the world. It's famous for taking on all the non-glamorous observations that are needed to fill the backlog of scientific data but that don't result in big name papers.   Mendel, who discovered genetic inheritance and formed the basis for Darwin's work was a Catholic monk.   So if you mis-label the Catholic church as anti-science you're perpetuating false narratives about a group defined by its race or gender or creed or sexual orientation etc.   So it may be uncomfortable for you to look in the mirror and realize that you're a hatemonger, but maybe you should reflect and stop perpetuating hateful nonsense. 😉 ",hendrixski,2025-05-07T14:02:56,-2
