"Trump and by extension his cronies, have a pathological inability to admit mistakes.  Only truly mentally ill people would be incapable of admitting such a blatant and obvious mistake",Cactusfan86,2025-04-07T17:06:21,1

"Jfc. If a foreign nation tried to use an uninhabited island as a source, they would not be able to trade because we don't have trade agreements with uninhabited islands.",Motodoso,2025-04-07T17:09:19,1

Just gonna quote HR McMaster’s description of the last trump presidency:  “At war with ourselves”.  The easy honest route is just never going to be trump path. Obliviously obfuscate with disingenuousness and prolix confusion.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-07T17:10:26,1

">The US Commerce Secretary has defended the country's decision to impose tariffs on a group of uninhabited islands, which are populated only by penguins and seals.  So basically, he's that redditor who doubles down on something dumb they said. Instead of just admitting they made a mistake.",raistlin65,2025-04-07T19:40:12,1
"This right here. It’s why they’re refusing to bring back that guy they “accidentally” disappeared on purpose to El Salvador.  No way they’ll ever let that dude do an interview (honestly think he’s already dead, anyway…no body, no crime). The regime doesn’t make mistakes.  Don’t question the regime.",DonorBody,2025-04-07T17:12:02,1
"Trump especially was literally taught to be this way by his even more evil father and Roy Cohn. Never admit mistakes, double down, lie, and go on the attack. It's meant to be a domination tactic.",LordSiravant,2025-04-07T17:40:24,1
