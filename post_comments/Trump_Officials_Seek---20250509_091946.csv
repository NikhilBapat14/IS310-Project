A move entirely driven by racism.,crazybones,2025-05-09T09:23:10,34
"Only white ones? Meanwhile the US has frozen the refugee program for others, deported immigrants and US citizens and jailed those legally in the country.",therapistofcats,2025-05-09T09:29:56,16
Of course.    Of course.,accountabilitycounts,2025-05-09T09:21:10,6
There it is.   The Great Replacement Theory is powering this.   It was always about racism and fear of not being in control.  Obsession with race has always been at the heart of American society.,Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-05-09T11:01:53,3

"This country really doesn't need anymore shitty white people, please just send them back. They're not fleeing some extremist regime or pogroms or some shit. ",LightningLucia,2025-05-09T10:34:04,1

Just what the country needs - more bigots. Got to help boost their numbers.,inthekeyofc,2025-05-09T09:44:34,13
"All while denying them their constitutional rights, claiming some kind of emergency?   If it's an emergency then why are they dicking around with trying to bring MORE immigrants in?",Valuable_Sea_4709,2025-05-09T10:02:02,5
"It’s a fairly trollish move but actually very small.  The US has had a non-white “diversity” green card program (via screen lottery, iirc) since a 1967 bipartisan law to the effect was approved.  So that annual immigration drawfs this one-off (which will be about 50k) by several million migrants.  Not to mention Reagan’s amnesty of millions of pre-1986 migrants from mostly Mexico.  This particularly small drop of juice is not worth the rhetorical squeeze, considering it’s an admin that may file “reverse discrimination” charges.",IronyElSupremo,2025-05-09T10:21:43,1
"Brother do you not realize his attacks on DEI programs are intrinsically racist? All DEI has ever  been is policy making sure that underserved communities are granted the same access to employment opportunities as any other area. Those underserved communities tend to be composed of minorities, ergo... Intrinsically racist.",AgentBooth,2025-05-09T09:31:34,12

Why? You’ll just move the goalposts and screech like a stuck pig when called out about it. At this point you lot just willingly put the blinders on or loudly cheer on the racist bs the trump dictatorship forces upon us.,Iainfixie,2025-05-09T09:48:41,3
"Pretty much.     The pattern usually starts with denial and gaslighting and then, when shown evidence, blaming the accusers of overreacting or racebaiting, making it their fault.  ",MysticKoolaid808,2025-05-09T09:36:27,1
You need /s at the end of that or people will think you are serious.,inthekeyofc,2025-05-09T09:39:31,1
