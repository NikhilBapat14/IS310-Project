“Tapping me along”?  Weird way to say “I’m working for Putin!”   Gonna point out Trump is admitting to what Kamala Harris told everyone he’d do. At the end of the debate she said he’d be getting played while eating out of dictators’ hands.,LuvKrahft,2025-04-26T11:49:54,188

"New term to me.  The way it makes the most sense is the old joke: ""If you tap more than twice, you are playing with yourself.""  Trump is clearly Russia's micro-peen in this analogy, and Putin has been tapping the shit out of him for about 40 years.  That is definitely ""playing with it"" territory.  Most would be chaffed and irritated long ago but Trump seems to thrive as a captive cock to an abusive potentate.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-04-26T12:58:20,3

"Trump is incredibly transactional, and responds well to anyone willing to stroke his ego because it reinforces what he wants to believe about himself. It doesn't surprise me at all that he might actually think all these people are his friends, based on his self-perceived interpersonal rapport with them.  What I wasn't banking on was, one, Putin taking his bullshit far enough that Trump would literally have to be a damp sponge not to see he's getting played, and two, Trump not actually being a damp sponge.  I'll believe his change of heart when I see different actions, but still, this kind of reflection is worth encouraging.
