"Probably not because such a tool would be waaaaay too huge to maintain. The President technically appoints a huge number of appointees, not just the highest level guys, so this would quickly become really impossible to keep up to date. Also most of those appointments are not really a political/partisan activity, so it's not really clear how useful such a tool would be.  All of the major appointees are something you can just look up. Maybe if you think this tool would be really useful, you can create it yourself.",mormagils,2022-08-17T09:09:41,1

Yeah I was actually thinking of building this out myself. And certainly would be very big but maybe just starting with department heads like secretaries/directors/commissioners/etc would be a v1. Just wanted to know if a tool like that exists already today before I built it,terragonpoly,2022-08-17T13:24:27,1
"the only issue with this tool is that while I can see all employees, I can't filter by which president appointment them since it's focused on _Biden's_ appointments. For example, I can see Charles Rettig who is the current IRS commissioner but it doesn't tell me who appointed them (I can deduce it's Trump based on the date he was appointed). But because I can't filter by president I can't, for example, see the total list of people appointed by Trump and still serving in their position today.",terragonpoly,2022-08-17T13:21:13,1
I haven't seen one. Good luck. That's a larger task than it seems.,mormagils,2022-08-17T13:33:08,1
You should be able to only list the holdovers.,DepartmentSudden5234,2022-08-17T13:29:19,1
