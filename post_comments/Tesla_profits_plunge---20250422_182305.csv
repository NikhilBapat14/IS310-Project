"The headline makes it sound like Tesla's profits are plunging because they're expecting him back, which is kind of awesome tbh.",OkayComputer1701,2025-04-22T18:25:12,14
"Tesla is in serious trouble.  These year to year profit drops are bad enough - but they don't give a realistic view of how Tesla's prospects have fallen off a cliff just in the last 100 days.  Carry out that drop off over the course of the next year - this is a complete disaster for Tesla.  The damage done over the last 100 days shows no sign of ending, instead the damage is accelerating.  Musk stepping away from DOGE is not going to save Tesla.  Musk is not merely toxic, he is incompetent - if he spends more time working on Tesla, it will only do more damage, not less.",Truthisnotallowed,2025-04-22T18:37:18,7

That’s adorable that he’s blaming tariffs and that he’s been away from the business for a 71% drop in income. He’s either lying or delusional. Probably both.,Rough-Adeptness-6670,2025-04-22T18:38:48,5

"He’s not “stepping back” his role was due to end, by law, in May anyway. And he already got what he wanted. Russia has their DOGE passwords, and all the investigations into his companies have been stopped   It’s such a joke that any of this was allowed to happen.

The drop in sales is so much worse than they’re letting on. A lot of this quarter sales were done before Mr nazi pants really got going meaning next quarter is going to be a complete disaster. They’re setting it up to sound like supply chain issues related to tariffs but it’s the actual cost of musk going full magat,kungfoojesus,2025-04-22T18:48:14,3

"Snippet from this news article “ CNN —  Elon Musk says he’s coming back to Tesla, partly stepping away from his high profile and controversial Trump administration role that has been blamed for a plunge in profits and sales at the company. Musk told Tesla investors on Tuesday that he would scale back his efforts at Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a day or two a week starting sometime next month.  “Starting next month, May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,” Musk said during a Tesla earnings call. But Musk defended his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), saying that it was necessary to cut back on “waste and fraud” as he urged investors to “look beyond the bumps and potholes immediately ahead of us.” He revealed the change after Tesla reported that its quarter fell far short of forecasts and that the escalating trade war was muddying the company’s outlook for the rest of this year.  While Tesla is less exposed to tariffs than most other automakers, it said it would have to revisit its guidance because of current trade disputes.  “It is difficult to measure the impacts of shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains, our cost structure and demand for durable goods and related services,” the company said. Trump slapped tariffs on auto imports on April 3 and promised to put additional ones on parts in the coming months. Tesla makes the cars it sells in the United States at American plants, so it is less exposed to tariffs on imported cars than other major automakers, but it does import parts for the cars it builds at its US factories. Musk did not specifically blame Trump for the uncertainty about trade policy, although he did try to put some distance between himself and the administration on that issue. “The tariff decision is entirely up to the President of the United States,” he said. “I will weigh in with my advice. I’ve been on the record many times saying lower tariffs are a good idea for prosperity. I’ll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs. That’s all I can do.” The automaker reported its revenue fell 9%, with auto revenue falling 20%. Adjusted income tumbled 39%. Those drops were bigger than forecast. It’s net income, the strictest definition of its profitability, plunged 71% compared to a year earlier.",AndroidOne1,2025-04-22T18:23:26,2

"Musk at DOGE in particular does not matter. You will always have guys like Vought and Thiel who will run things at various levels who view government itself as something worth destroying as a matter of principle, and as an object of personal hatred. Musk wanting to deal with his own brand, or his own companies? Fine. But the idea of DOGE is still there.",steve_ample,2025-04-22T19:32:58,2

"Yes , he is tired of wrecking the government and wants to go back to Tesla and continue with his meddling and tyrannical mismanagement.   He must have plenty more cockeyed ideas in store to rival his Cluster Fuck and Robo Taxi disasters.

Moron Musk going back to Tesla isn't going to help. Anyone that indiscriminately cuts tens-of-thousands of jobs and hundreds of thousands more through the fallout and then celebrates with a gold chainsaw will always be hated. I will never give him a dime. EVER!,dlrasmussen,2025-04-22T18:35:58,5
