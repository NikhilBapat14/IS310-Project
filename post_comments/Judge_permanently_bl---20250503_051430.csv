"“The U.S. Constitution affords critical protections against Executive action like that ordered in EO 1423,” Howell, referring to the executive order, wrote in her 100-plus page opinion. “Government officials, including the President, may not ‘subject … individuals to ‘retaliatory actions’ after the fact for having engaged in protected speech.’”",Easy-Preparation-667,2025-05-03T05:32:14,256
Does anything that Trump's doing or done actually get blocked because a judge said so? It seems as if another judge just says it's okay and the first is threatened with removal from office.,invalidpassword,2025-05-03T05:42:38,64

"There are two kinds of Republicans in this country. Those that follow the news, know all about the completely idiotic shit Trump pulls on an near hourly basis and choose not to care because their hate blinds them to their common sense and those who pay no attention to politics at all, who LOVE Trump and think he's the second coming also because their hate blinds them to their common sense. It's disgraceful, despicable, disgusting and DOWNRIGHT DUMB! LOL.",ILoveSodyPop,2025-05-03T07:59:46,25
You guys think trump is going to eventually post a rant about changing the constitution soon? I'd love to see him make a 2am post about installing a new form of government not bound by the constitution and then delete it.   Then we get to watch Republican gymnastics.,HiImDIZZ,2025-05-03T23:07:08,2

"This ruling is a banger. Instant classic, hall of fame.  Where's the MAGA ""muh constitution"" supporters?  > No American President has ever before issued executive orders like the one at issue in this lawsuit targeting a prominent law firm with adverse actions to be executed by all Executive branch agencies but, in purpose and effect, this action draws from a playbook as old as Shakespeare, who penned the phrase: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.” When Shakespeare’s character, a rebel leader intent on becoming king hears this suggestion, he promptly incorporates this tactic as part of his plan to assume power, leading in the same scene to the rebel leader demanding “[a]way with him,” referring to an educated clerk, who “can make obligations and write court hand"" Eliminating lawyers as the guardians of the rule of law removes a major impediment to the  path to more power. See Walters v. Nat’l Ass’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 371 n.24  (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining the import of the same Shakespearean statement to be “that disposing of lawyers is a step in the direction of a totalitarian form of government”).  > In a cringe-worthy twist on the theatrical phrase “Let’s kill all the lawyers,” EO 14230 takes the approach of “Let’s kill the lawyers I don’t like,” sending the clear message: lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.  > Using the powers of the federal government to target lawyers for their representation of clients and avowed progressive employment policies in an overt attempt to suppress and punish  certain viewpoints, however, is contrary to the Constitution  > Executive Order 14230 is unconstitutional",Out_of_the_Bloo,2025-05-03T11:13:19,68

"There’s 1 kind of republican in this country. And we call them Nazis. It’s the whole “there are 9 nazis at the table and 1 person that doesn’t speak up, so the table has 10 nazis” or however the saying goes. Everything could be stopped if the GOP wanted to. They haven’t tried, and have actively pushed Mango Mussolini’s agenda forward. So now we have them wanting citizens exiled (not deported, can’t “deport” a citizen) to foreign work/death camps, due process has been tossed out the window for those that need it the most (and soon, the rest of us), judges arrested for not kissing the ring, generals and govt officials being fired then replaced with incompetent yes-men stooges, and corruption is rampant and out in the open more than ever (and when referring to federal govt, that’s saying A LOT).",NoProbLlama18,2025-05-03T18:02:27,2

"I COMPLETELY agree with everything you just said. I was speaking more about the Republican voters than the Republican politicians. I think we can all agree that they're all just perfect examples of the worst humanity has to offer. If you would have told me in Obama's last year as president that this was going to happen after the progress we had made as a country I would have had a stroke. It's 2025 ffs. I, maybe somewhat naively, thought that we were going to continue progressing away from racism, sexism and homophobia. I was hoping that it would be a thing of the past by the time I died.

"The implication is that Republicans in Congress may be too cowardly to actually hold Trump accountable for violating the law over and over again, and it's unclear what power the judicial branch has to actually stop Trump if he decides he wants to ignore the courts (as he's already trying to do)",WalkingEars,2025-05-03T10:14:51,18

The only way that Trump will ever be held accountable for anything or kept with the acceptable societal boundaries is if people vote to flip the house and senate in 2026. If people are still allowed to vote by then that is.   People get what they deserve when they vote the way they do.,TruthSearcher1970,2025-05-04T13:08:07,2
"I just reread my comment and realized I went off on a tangent about the govt, as one does these days lol. The politicians are pure evil, for sure, but I feel the voters don’t get a pass on this one. 1st term, he showed us what he is: (insert favorite derogatory trump adjectives here). But to make the choice to get him in for a second time? Absolutely no passes given. We all saw the pandemic, Jan 6th, the entire 4 years between terms, the lack of respect and/or kindness to anyone not actively going along with his shit. We all knew this would happen, screamed it from the rooftops begging people to actually SEE what was coming.  Sure, you could chalk their choice up to dis/misinformation, lack of education, falling literacy rates, and all the “outs” I’ve seen people give the republican voters. But you can make a choice to learn, inform yourself, and broaden your horizons. And they didn’t. They just grunted “R good, D bad, Daddy Trump 4ever” and condemned us all to this shitstorm. There are people that can maybe forgive this (and good on you, you’re better than me), but I can’t. If we survive these 4 years, it will take generations to undo the damage. I thought we were making progress too, slowly but surely, and it’s being undone so quickly is disheartening. And exhausting, I’m so tired.  Also, to all the nonvoters who “couldn’t be bothered” or played the “both sides are bad” card: fuck you too, your inaction got us here just as much as the GOP voters action did. The choices of candidates may not have been the best, but a vote still should have been cast. So go sit at the Nazi table with the rest of the fuckheads.",NoProbLlama18,2025-05-03T19:56:07,2

Yes it is. Just know that oligarchs have the luxury of exercising the full legal process. For them the District judge has the same enforcement options as a middle school hall monitor. Normally DOJ is given the task of enforcement. But our DOJ is much like the German SA. So then enforcement must be outsourced to another entity not part of the Executive Branch. This is extremely rare.   Most likely it now heads to Appellate. In the meantime... Trump will ignore it.,williamgman,2025-05-03T11:42:40,8
