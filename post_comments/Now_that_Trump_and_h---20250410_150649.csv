Nope. He’s a convicted felon and rapist and the republicans like that,ButterscotchIll1523,2025-04-10T16:29:25,16
"No, because everyone would be responsible for actually charging him and taking him to court is one of his allies. Also, keep in mind that SCOTUS was stupid enough to give him the ability to do pretty much whatever the fuck he wants so long as he calls it an official act of the president. He'll just say it was an official act. He'd walk. Literally the ONLY way we'll get him out is if we impeach and convict him. I don't see that happening unless we can take back majority control of both the House and the Senate. We need to get Democrats elected in the midterms because the Republicans are just as corrupt as he is. They ain't gonna do shit. The Democrats just don't have the numbers in office right now. We need to change that.",Ahleron,2025-04-10T15:32:17,10

"America deserves an honest and competent leader, not a deranged puppet who is hell-bent on revenge, destruction, bullying, and pillaging. This president should resign in disgrace, for this open and massive corruption. The public outcry should be unanimous, from all non-cult members in every corner of the country. These are not “white collar” crimes; these are “red maga hat/orange collar” crimes from a self-described “day 1 dictator”, who violates his oath to the constitution on a daily basis.  Unfortunately, he is not “busted” until being charged with a crime and convicted. If the pesky DOJ “memo” about not charging sitting presidents gets in the way, then congress must impeach and remove him immediately. By the way, the DOJ used to function independently of the executive, not used as a revenge tool of GOP fascists, so maybe that 1970s memo should be updated for 2025.",benganis,2025-04-10T16:15:32,3
Any other president would get fried for this.  But that's already been true about 200 times so far for trump.  The entire GOP should be thrown in jail with him.  They are what's enabling this incredible shitshow.,Weakera,2025-04-11T06:38:04,2
Not really insider trading as he announced it to the world. It is however 100% market manipulation which is equally as illegal but unfortunately he gutted the regulatory bodies and we only have “unconstitutional lawyer Barbie” to do anything about it.,adenasyn,2025-04-10T15:46:23,4

"If by ""real"" you mean ""good,"" then probably no, we cannot.  If you want good leadership for the country, you have to increase the country's share of sane people who can and will vote for Democrats so that they're at least the plurality of the country, and distribute them across the states in a way that doesn't waste the advantage of being at least the plurality.",wonkalicious808,2025-04-10T18:38:20,1

"Yeah that’s the problem we have.  No one is really going to prosecute fraud perpetrated by the president.  Under a normal administration, they would.   But not this one.

How did the Dems become the party of the rich elite? I always recall the rich voting for the GOP. I was being held hostage by FOX Entertainment Channel today during my lunch at a diner and they were talking about how the left doesn’t realize the issues illegals are having on sanctuary cities because they all live in wealthy gated communities.

"Yes I agree with this.  It seems impeachment is the only answer, for that you need midterm backlash or a big exodus of GOPs from party discipline before midterms, I wonder if enough will wake up or grow a conscience--the only pressure can come from their constituents.

"Are they?  Last I checked, Trump staffed his administration with the most morally corrupt billionaires; television, radio and internet personalities, and the worst of them.    In the 70s, the Republican Party recruited cult leaders from the Evangelicals, Mormons and Adventists who sold out Jesus for money and earthly power.  The followers of these cult leaders were trained to vote against their interests and for Republicans.  The Mormons are goofy, but they at least have morality; the others, not so much.",Mindless_Listen7622,2025-04-10T16:42:09,10
