"Only read the DOJ press release, and really, I only skimmed it, but it claims the Clean Air Act precludes the states from doing this, so the argument is based on the supremacy clause. Federal law is the supreme law of the land and the CAA gives authority over this to the feds.  I wouldn't trust their argument.  A more common way the feds can interfere with state actions is through the power of the purse. The feds give the states a lot of money and they can make that money contingent on the states changing certain laws.  This is how the federal government got the states to change their speed limits to 55 and the drinking age to 21. They limited highway funds to states that enacted those laws. This would require congress to pass a law.",travio,2025-05-02T09:41:10,7
"The Constitution gives certain powers to the federal government and leaves everything else to the states.
