"In Roe v. Wade, a national right to abortion was established through a specific legal concept called substantive due process. This is the legal concept that was discussed and rejected for abortion in Dobbs. It would be reasonable for someone to apply the Dobbs precedent to other substantive due process rights, yes, but it would not really make sense to apply that precedent to anything else.  You're basically oversimplifying. It wasn't that abortion was overturned because it's not in the Constitution. It's overturned because the Court rejected the premises of substantive due process which protects rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.   So no, you could not use Dobbs to justify secession, but you could use it to justify taking away federal protections on interracial marriage, for example.",mormagils,2022-11-03T09:26:33,5
"Nothing is really settled law, everything is subject to judicial review as the Supreme Court, being made of humans, is fallable and sometimes makes mistakes or views constitutionality in inappropriate ways that later Supreme Court benches might not think holds up.  The military appropriations clause has had a bit of a weird view about it. There's a reason the National Defense Authorization Act which comes up generally every year or every other year is considered must pass.  https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-8/clause-11%E2%80%9314/time-limit-on-appropriations-for-the-army  https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-1/55-the-power-to-raise-and-maintain-armed-forces.html   If you really want to get high quality and detailed answers you might want to go to a focused subreddit like r/supremecourt",JudgeWhoOverrules,2022-11-03T12:18:43,2

Yes.  Basically the Dobbs decision made it clear the Alito wing of the court thinks it has sole authority to reinterpret the Constutution and the Bill of Rights in line with whatever modern Republican policy is. There are no consistent arguments between the Trump-appointed judges and Alito what exactly a ‘real’ right under the Constitution is. It’s essentially whatever they say.,dunpyklungo,2022-11-04T06:54:37,2
"Yep, and therein lies the problem.  If the SC blows up 'settled law' and ignores precedent, they they crack open the dam, and everyone and anyone can attack all those ideas that were just 'agreed upon' and not enshrined into law all these years.  Worse yet, they can win, especially on conservative points.   The legislature would actually have to do their job and make laws, and as we know they're notoriously bad at doing that unless one party has an absolute 60 vote majority in both houses.",periphery72271,2022-11-03T08:57:31,1
"I tend to think of this concept as :  **'if we didn't think to outlaw it, it's not outlawed'.**  Which is a right and proper attitude for a government to take.  However, *homicide* **is** an issue that has been considered, and outlawed - so the ultimate questions regarding the morality, and legality of abortion remain.  These being :  1)  When does a human zygote become a *human being* ( assuming that only  human *beings* have the *right* .to life in this context).  2)  Does an immature *human being* have the right to depend -  *totally* - on the its parents for *everything* required for life,--,  until maturation.  These issues never seem to be well addressed by *any* side of this this issue, even though they are essential.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-11-06T15:32:52,1
"Just to be clear, *Loving v. Virginia*, which was about interracial marriage, also relied on equal protection grounds, not just substantive due process.  So reconsidering substantive due process would *not* necessarily affect interracial marriage.",digbyforever,2022-11-03T10:31:36,4
Wow.  Great feedback.  Are you a constitutional scholar?,bonzoboy2000,2022-11-03T09:50:36,1
"> If the SC blows up 'settled law' and ignores precedent, they they crack open the dam, and everyone and anyone can attack all those ideas that were just 'agreed upon' and not enshrined into law all these years.  This is an odd argument to make given that Roe v. Wade ignored 'settled law' in the first place.",ViskerRatio,2022-11-04T23:15:13,2
"Good correction. Loving could certainly be weakened, but there are still some rights that are entirely based on substantive due process. The right to privacy is one, and it affects not just abortion, but lots of sex-related stuff. Conceivably, birth control and sodomy laws could be revisited under Dobbs.",mormagils,2022-11-03T10:37:25,4
"I took some con law classes in undergrad and remembered some of it. I've still got most of my books on my shelf and can refer to them for questions like this as needed.  So no, I shouldn't be teaching any classes or publishing any papers, but I'm not a completely layperson, either. I'm in that perfect window to give really good answers on a sub like this most of the time, though an actual con law scholar could probably fill out this answer or clarify it, or walk back something I'm overstating just a little bit on.  EDIT: For example, see digbyforever's correction.",mormagils,2022-11-03T09:55:16,2
