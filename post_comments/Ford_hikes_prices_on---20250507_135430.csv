How long before Trump calls the Ford CEO saying these actions are hostile and anti-American?,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-07T13:55:38,9
"*The vehicles subject to the price increases of up to $2,000 per model include the Maverick, Bronco Sport and Mach-E, Ford said in a statement to CBS News*  These prices will go into effect in late June. Other models from other companies are expected to cost from 2k-10 more later this year.",fxkatt,2025-05-07T14:09:20,7
"Funny.  I was under the impression that Mexican folks made weekly trips to the US Tariff Office in their towns and villages in order to make their deposits and say thank you (in English, of course).  Was I mistaken?",I405CA,2025-05-07T14:47:36,6
But...but I thought Mexico paid the tariff?   /s,blues111,2025-05-07T13:59:37,4

"Yah, I don't see people buying new anymore. Although, pre-owned models might increase in sales.  But! They might increase the price on those to offset the cost of the newer models and tariffs.  At the end of the day, they've still gotta put new cars and trucks on the lot.  Sad times indeed.  Car companies are going to be so screwed.",HonoredPeople,2025-05-07T14:16:42,4

He won't call the CEO until it's listed as a line item on the window sticker.  Raising prices are great for the GOP but listing out the tariffs as a line item shows his voters how he's screwing them.,Archer1407,2025-05-07T14:10:29,7
