"Of course, it’s been obvious forever. They’re the cancel culture they’ve been yelling about all these years.  And it’s totally a bunch of social pariahs doing it.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-28T15:57:55,24

"Shoutout to Peter Shamshiri's blog! He and Michael Hobbes have been lighting up the reactionary centrist/anti-woke writers who claimed to be deeply concerned about illiberal leftists canceling people, but now don't have a peep to say about actual government intrusion on free speech.  Peter's blog (string in a maze) is great as are the podcasts If Books Could Kill and 5-4: Why the Supreme Court Sucks.",Pike_Gordon,2025-04-28T19:47:34,5

"I mean it pretty much already is. About the only thing that hasn't happened (as far as I've seen) yet is reddit changing upvotes to promote content they want. The site already has that ability though if I recall correctly (think it's automatically done to prevent bot voting), but they absolutely censor stuff as people have seen with LM and a few other topics. This is without even going into how moderation is done across several subreddits on the platform.",nubyplays,2025-04-28T16:20:31,8
