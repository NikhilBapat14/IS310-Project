"From the article:  Attorney Abbe Lowell is striking out to launch a new law firm dedicated to representing “those facing politicized investigations” and other legal actions from the Trump administration.  Lowell, a longtime white collar defense attorney, has represented figures on both sides of the aisle, including Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as well as Hunter Biden.  The venture comes after Lowell left Winston & Strawn amid reports he would represent New York Attorney General Letitia James after she was referred for criminal investigation based on alleged mortgage fraud.  “This firm is prepared for today’s dynamic legal landscape, offering a leaner model than larger firms can provide,” Lowell said in a statement. “I started my private practice career in my own firm and am excited to once again lead a small yet nimble team ready to represent companies, non-profits and individuals in need of our experience and dedication.”",kootles10,2025-05-02T08:04:38,159

Now is the time for especially elder millennial lawyers who now have nearly 20 years experience and who were locked out of the big law system during the great recession to create their own mega firms and partnerships.

"I get what you are saying, and I agree that this is absolutely necessary. We have all got to stand up and push back, and this new law firm is a good example of that.  BUT, law firms can only argue in court, and Trump is already defanging the courts.  The courts don't have Marshals, nor police of any sort, nor military of any kind. Trump has all of that.  The courts can't arrest Trump or even any cabinet members nor agency heads, rightfully or not. Trump can arrest judges and lawyers, rightfully or not.",Hesychios,2025-05-02T10:01:00,1

"""congressional supermajorities""  That is essentially a prerequisite. Then the real fight begins. We need supermajorities to do everything necessary to save the republic. Even with that it's iffy, no guarantees ...  MAGA Republicans already know this, which is why they are pushing for additional ways to disenfranchise voters (and confuse the rest) and challenge results.  The so-called 'Save Act' is part of this, the nebulous language about birth certificates matching voters' names was specifically designed create havoc. Most married people who have changed their names at marriage (many people do, mostly women still, but men also sometimes hyphenate two names) will not be taking steps to address this before election day. The states will allow the votes per their own laws but Orcs will challenge results in all states, sowing chaos to prevent the seating of Democrats in Congress.  Don't be surprised if Trump tries to arrest some governors by that time.  We are at war. Right now. The cabal around Trump is actively attacking on several fronts and most of us can't comprehend it.",Hesychios,2025-05-02T09:51:25,8

"The courts can deputize anyone and, even if they don't specifically do so, they can issue a warrant which ANY law enforcement officer in the country can execute on. This whole ""the court is toothless"" idea is a myth. They may not be able to stop a determined military action or something of that nature, but they can hold individuals involved responsible and fuck up their lives beyond recognition.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-02T10:17:09,3

"OK, that is the theoretical. Let's explore this.  The US Supreme Court issues a warrant for Kristi Noem's arrest and someone or some team of people are deputized for that purpose. DHS employees (some of the meanest bastards in public service, just saying) block the door. How are they going to apprehend her? Where would they hold her that Trump couldn't get her out?  What about Pam Bondi? Same story.  I made the argument several times a few years ago (while Biden was president) that the Department of Justice should be removed from the Executive Branch to become an independent agency, insulated from presidential control. No one paid attention whatsoever, it's like the problem didn't register. People couldn't see it.  I know that most of our National Security people are good people deep down inside. They are so ethical they would not question the authority put above them, they would do their appointed duty or resign. Now Trump controls them, he just fires one after another until he gets what he wants. No one has the balls of Jeff Sessions in this administration, no one now would refuse Trump to his face.  We don't have a mechanism to actually remove a president that has been impeached and convicted. It's not like evicting a tenant in arrears.  Sixty years ago even that scoundrel Nixon had an abiding respect for the Constitution. He resigned out of a sense of shame. If the House had impeached him and the Senate had convicted him he would have left the White House in disgrace. He would have left under his own power, he would have faced the door and walked out to a limo and rode away.  Nixon did not have a ruling from SCOTUS stating that he could break the law in the performance of his duties. As bad as that dude was he did not have the shameless character to take full advantage of it.  Trump does. Trump has just the sort of immoral and unethical character to take full advantage of that ruling. If marshals from SCOTUS or deputies of some sort came to the white house looking for Trump or Vance the miscreant would just lock them up, then send his own people to arrest SCOTUS! That's where we are today.",Hesychios,2025-05-02T11:40:44,2

"I disagree with the premise of your example. I don't need an answer to what would happen because we are still so many steps away from that happening. We are not there today, where the courts would do this or where DHS would stand in the way. People (disproportionately on Reddit) *believe* we are there today because people are scared. And people are doing what fascists are counting on us doing: Assuming the fascist regime has power and therefore acting like it has power, eliminating the need for the regime to actually do anything to seize that power.   Your comment is a perfect example. It's basically ""why try to hold the administration accountable when they are too powerful to be restricted? Better just to not try that avenue."" Which is bullshit. The evil part of the trump administration is like 200 people and some savage ICE agents. Those 200 people are talking and walking like they've already won against 350 million others.  So far, the Trump administration has obeyed court orders in everything *except* Abrego Garcia's case, which isn't that straightforward and gives them an out. While everyone is watching the EOs and the major cases making it to SCOTUS, they are missing the *literally* hundreds of cases around the country that are being ruled against the administration and resulting in the administration having to backtrack.   To get from that realty of today to one where Noem is under arrest and DHS is going against a court order to protect her - it's just not something anyone could possibly answer right now. We would first have to go through escalation after escalation with people in Washington, the military, the press, and the DOJ all choosing sides. No one can predict right now what that would look like. And I, frankly, refuse to give Trump the benefit of assuming he will ever have the power to push us to that point.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-02T15:42:46,1
