It must be something or else they wouldn't be screaming so much.,Theloripalooza,2025-05-02T18:51:15,56
It's the indirect funding. Other entities get federal funding that they funnel back to NPR and PBS. That's why the EO included a prohibition on indirect funding.,ngoni,2025-05-03T00:23:24,19
Principals actually matter. Does that 15% fund bullshit propaganda? Absolutely. It needs to be removed.,rasputin777,2025-05-02T19:42:32,37

"It is clear they don't need it - why do they keep taking it?  ""Listeners like you"" will flock to make up any shortfalls.",lousycesspool,2025-05-03T05:35:47,0
I don't think they are screaming much. I think it's just being amplified to make it look that way. It's just a dumb thing to go after.,Uller85,2025-05-02T18:53:14,29

"What worse propaganda? Defunding an organization that only people 80+ and kids watch, or a news story talking about the Administration killing big bird and Bill Nye that distracts from the real wins?",Uller85,2025-05-02T20:11:36,-26
Exactly. Stuff like this shouldn't even make the news. It literally makes no difference and is only spun in a negative way.,Uller85,2025-05-02T19:18:06,1

"The best course is to truck ahead and get things done, including this, without fanfare. Just do the work and keep your head down. If asked, don't deny it. Give a reason and keep moving.",Uller85,2025-05-02T20:39:49,-4

Why are you telling the Trump admin to move on when it's the democrats that are complaining and making it into a big thing?,day25,2025-05-02T21:19:25,1
