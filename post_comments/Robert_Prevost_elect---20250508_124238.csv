"A Francis-aligned fresh young pope from the city of Chicago, who went to South America and learned multiple languages, spoke to the audience as Pope in Italian and Spanish, and is a champion for migrants and the poor.

"I for one am ready to see everyone who lived and breathed Catholic and papal hate suddenly be SO into the Church....maybe it's a blessing, maybe it will drive people into the pews on Sunday to hear the actual messages Jesus taught; love thy neighbor, feed the hungry, house the migrant etc. I'll have to see this not as impending doom but an unexpected swing in the right direction.",3CatsInATrenchcoat16,2025-05-08T12:48:47,4

An American is in charge of a small European country that has hundreds of millions of followers. It’s political. Donald Trump is no longer the most important American figure in world politics.,Killa_Crossover,2025-05-08T12:48:03,15

His entire public Twitter post/repost history for 2025 is: - 1 repost criticising of Trump and Bukele for their treatment of migrants - 2 reposts of updates on Pope Francis's health - 2 tweets criticizing JD Vance for misunderstanding Christianity  Those 2 posts about JD Vance are his only non-reposts since June 2020. This man went almost 5 years without tweeting until he felt the need to call out JD Vance.,quildtide,2025-05-08T16:29:55,12

I think the current administration has made my knee jerk reaction to be....reactionary. But looking at his stances I'm cautiously optimistic that they will renew our dignity on a world stage. God must truly have a sense of humor.,3CatsInATrenchcoat16,2025-05-08T13:00:03,3
He'll have as much influence on Donald Trump as the last pope. Which is to say none.  Trump thinks he's smarter and better than everyone else on the planet. And beyond if you believe in a higher power.,_scyllinice_,2025-05-08T12:55:25,3

Missing the point. It’s not about who answers to who. It’s about who the world looks at the as the leader of America. Sorry bud but as of today that title now belongs to the Pope.,Killa_Crossover,2025-05-08T12:59:23,0
