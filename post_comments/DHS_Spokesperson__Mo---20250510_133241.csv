"Kevin Roberts (Heritage Foundation) says that the next revolution will be bloodless if the left allows it to be. Meaning, roll over while I wipe my butt with the constitution and close your eyes. And pretend to enjoy it.  Sorry, wrong article.  I was writing in response to the  suspension of habeas corpus.  Still kinda fits so gonna leave it.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-05-10T13:41:21,1
"Democrats - this is your chance to call them on this. Go get arrested! Get arrested every day if you can. Make them arrest mayors, senators, representatives, etc. Bring the media with you.

"Democrats spent 4 years terrified to arrest obvious criminals on the Republican side for a huge variety of criminality because they are afraid of what the voters might think. And now that the Republicans are back in office they are salivating to start making arrests over even the least imaginary “crimes”. Democrats depend on norms. Even after the Republicans have demonstrated a million times that they not only will ignore the norms, but shove them up the Democrats a*sses.",SarasCaptions,2025-05-10T14:28:57,1

"Sucks that the DoJ under Biden didn't arrest Republicans for 1/6 because that would've been too partisan, and now the predictable reversal has happened. And I'm expecting Schumer will keep pushing for a moderate approach and Dems will keep voting for Trump nominees even as they're being arrested.",Scarlettail,2025-05-10T13:43:53,1
"As a side note, that headline just sounds like Captain Holt using old-timey words mixed wiht enabling, but this part is still concerning/scary:  >A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said arresting three Democratic members of Congress is “on the table” following a chaotic scene outside of an immigrant detention center on Friday.  >Three New Jersey Democrats — Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez and LaMonica McIver — were there for a tour of a new Trump administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, Delaney Hall, which is expected to play a significant role in its Northeast immigration operations. But chaos broke out when federal agents [arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/09/new-jersey-mayor-ras-baraka-ice-00339287), a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, setting off a tense scrum including the three members of Congress.  >There will be more arrests coming,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN on Saturday morning. In response to a request for further comment, DHS referred questions to the interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba. Her office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from POLITICO.  >The possibility of arrests marks an escalation of the Trump administration’s crackdown on public officials and comes as a [Wisconsin judge](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/25/fbi-arrest-judge-milwaukee-immigration-00309382) was arrested late last month for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.  >A spokesperson for Watson Coleman said her office had not heard from DHS; it had only seen the public statements by the department.  >In response to those, Watson Coleman’s office said it had reviewed body camera footage from DHS and that “proves that DHS has been lying about this incident — blatantly lying.”  >Though federal law enforcement officials at the scene did tell Baraka to leave a fenced-in parking lot area, which he eventually did before being later arrested, they did not ever appear to ask the members of Congress to leave. But one official appeared to shove McIver as she was trying to re-enter a secure parking lot at the tail end of the chaotic scrum. Baraka is facing trespassing charges and was released from federal custody on Friday night after scores of supporters gathered outside a separate federal facility where he had been held.  >McLaughlin alleged one of the members had “body slammed” an ICE officer, something that a POLITICO reporter on the scene did not witness. She told CNN there was a video of the incident that ICE would be released “very shortly.”",newfrontier58,2025-05-10T13:35:27,1

"Here is one way to take action that may actually result in change: sign up for the General Strike.  Things are rapidly declining in our country and it’s getting close to “show up or shut up” time.  Let’s get this done and show this administration that we, the people, are prepared to shut the country down for as long as it takes to get real, lasting change.  Unfortunately, we can’t plan a date for the GS until we have the numbers large enough that can’t be ignored (11 million). Let’s get organized and show who actually has the power (hint: it’s people like you and me, if we can band together)  https://generalstrikeus.com/",hkyxt,2025-05-10T17:31:17,1

"He says this.. but my guess is that he didn't anticipate this authoritarian shit going on while Donnie is (seemingly intentionally) ratfucking the economy.  Honestly, if shit continues, and we go into the summer with empty shelves and people losing their jobs left and right, this is going to result in something *incredibly fucking messy*.  I've been hearing griping from people that ""don't follow politics""... people that, were it just the slow slide into authoritarianism like Roberts was likely talking about, would have stayed happily oblivious to whats going on.    But they're being *forced* to pay attention to shit because they're wondering why the fuck everything is suddenly so expensive and why jobs are so incredibly hard to come by all of a sudden.. and they're starting to see *the other shit* that is going on.  This is just going to get worse when shelves start to dry up.",absentmindedjwc,2025-05-10T14:24:47,1

The movement escalated to the point of racist thugs siccing police dogs and fire hoses on the protesters, and that imagery being beamed around the world had a legitimate effect on getting the right people to make the right decisions, decisions they may not have made otherwise.
