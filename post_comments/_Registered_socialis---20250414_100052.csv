Over on news they are all calling him a maga conservative and not a single person is saying otherwise. Has that sub officially banned us all?,Hectoriu,2025-04-14T15:09:24,63
"If he really is registered as a DSA member, that's going to be a big deal since they celebrated the next day after the Oct 7 massacre.",Timely_Car_4591,2025-04-14T10:23:54,64
Dangerous Rhetoric from the left is out of control.,Whole-Essay640,2025-04-14T12:52:04,23
Unbelievable physiognomy check on this guy. He looks like Anthony Huber pictured from memory.   Something about thirty-something guys where you can just instantly tell if they're into antifa shit. That's the age where decisions become more visible on people's faces.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-14T10:05:42,56

He hated some democrats because they weren’t far enough to the left.   Reddit: he’s MAGA,JTuck333,2025-04-14T20:17:36,12

Probably?  That or it's not worth even responding because some stasi adjacent mod will stealth remove your comment or ban you.  Or lock the thread when it becomes too based. That's another news trick.,atomic1fire,2025-04-14T16:12:42,16
"Gee, isn't Comrade Ocasio-Cortez a DSA member?",New_Ant_7190,2025-04-14T12:58:29,40
I think you're overthinking it. Their bad personal hygiene and nutrition habits make them all look a certain way because they don't know how to take care of themselves.,IVcrushonYou,2025-04-14T10:31:19,35

"Remember the Antifa fight training video?  https://youtu.be/3yxVAhAtExs?si=fjSch_ODoTRYMcgb  These people have not exercised since grade school. I assume their diet is bar food, beer, some vegetarian, etc. Every one of them look weak, pallid, completely unintimidating. They get their confidence way up just to do things like this.   https://i.makeagif.com/media/10-02-2020/ByUQci.gif  If you can't tell, the smaller guy had a police baton and tried hitting the guy who knocked him out with it.",OliverMonster1,2025-04-14T17:32:42,5
