"Ahh yes, another ""joke.""  Or just another desperate attempt from his supporters to defend their pure and irreproachable Godking and his petulant behavior.   Here's what happened...  King Trump took a detour to the Pope's funeral, and during the small portion of the ceremony that he remained awake for, he noticed that hundreds of thousands of people had come to pay their respects to the guy. So Trump being Trump‚Äîthe narcissistic manchild he is‚Äîhe became immediately envious of the reception the Pope received.  Since then, Trump has likely been fixated on this image of him receiving such a massive tribute to his own holiness. So now his way of telling the world that he's insecure and resentful of someone else being so popular, is to ""jokingly"" suggest that he deserves to be the next Pope, that he deserves to be God's chosen one and showered with praise and admiration, that he is entitled to be on equal terms with, nay, above the level of a globally renowned and respected leader.  And perhaps the worst part is that some of his ardent supporters and sycophants within the Republican party agree with him.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-03T15:43:47,1

"As per [original article](https://people.com/donald-trump-shares-fake-ai-photo-of-himself-as-the-pope-11727753) üì∞:  - Donald Trump shared a fake, AI-generated photo of himself as the pope on social media, 11 days after Pope Francis‚Äô death  Trump, 78, shared the photo on his Truth Social account on Friday, May 2, just days after jokingly stating he should succeed the late Pope Francis. The image was also shared 11 days after Francis died of a stroke at age 88, and six days after Trump attended the pontiff‚Äôs funeral at the Vatican.  The president shared no caption alongside the image, which depicts him sitting with a stern expression and holding up one finger while wearing white and gold papal attire, including a large cross necklace.  The photo was quickly reposted across social media platforms, where it was met with heavy criticism.  One viral post by an X account called ‚ÄúRepublicans Against Trump‚Äù shared the artificially enhanced image and wrote, in part, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs full-on lunacy at this point.‚Äù  Harry Sisson, a vocal Democrat and political content creator, also received attention for his X post about the AI image, calling out the president for sharing such posts, instead of working to combat issues like rising inflation.  ‚ÄúTrump just posted an AI image of himself as the Pope. Instead of working to bring down costs, he‚Äôs doing this instead,‚Äù Sisson wrote. ‚ÄúNice job, MAGA! You elected a man-child.‚Äù  Others, like X user @MissSassbox, criticized Trump for not only the content of the controversial post, but for making the ‚Äúdisrespectful‚Äù choice to share it so soon after Francis‚Äô death.  ‚ÄúThis is literally the President of the United States of America while the Vatican is still grieving the loss of Pope Francis and trying to pick his successor,‚Äù the user wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even funny at this point, it‚Äôs actually disrespectful and I‚Äôm not even Catholic.‚Äù  When asked by reporters on the White House lawn about his choice for the next pope, Trump mused for a second before answering with a smile.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to be pope. That would be my number one choice,‚Äù he said, before stating more seriously that he has ‚Äúno preference‚Äù about the upcoming papal conclave, which is set to begin on May 7.",T_Shurt,2025-05-03T14:22:08,1

The response to this is still unbelievably mild. What is Trump's superpower? The terrible things he gets away with all the time is just mind-boggling. HRC's email (a big nothing) was talked about for 2..3...4 years as if she'd killed someone.   We can all think of probably 30 genuinely bad things Trump's done and list them in under a minute and they're all...poof!....gone from public and media awareness as if they'd never happened at all.
