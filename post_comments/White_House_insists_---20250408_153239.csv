Playing trade war with a country that does not have democratic elections is kind of dumb.  May be more than dumb.,metskyfan,2025-04-08T16:16:25,58
She also said that Trump had a spine of steel. I am not particularly worried about Trump’s spine. The spines of the people he’s walking all over are a concern.,Stormy31568,2025-04-08T15:33:11,44
104%.   And that Chinese product is still cheaper than if it was Made In America.  This is a prelude to Great Depression inflation.,YallerDawg,2025-04-08T16:24:54,36

"104% Tariff's  What is.. I mean, how is that translated to the average person?  Explain plz?     If something cost me $10 total (e.g. I bought it on Amazon, its made and shipped from China, from a Chineese company etc)...  is that product now $24.xx?  I just don't get how tariffs work is all.  American company makes something in China and it is shipped here and sold to me (via Amzon for example) and it is $10 pre-Dumbledor, is it now $24.xx?  Thank you for your comments and education",Beneficial-Nimitz68,2025-04-08T16:52:00,2

"The other thing to keep in mind is that people in China or anywhere with the possible exception of the Heard & Marshall Islands (possible) aren’t stupid. I can think of a couple of ways to game that system and I am hardly an economic genius. I expect Canada in Europe to be mostly honest in their dealings, but I suspect there are some countries that have all the integrity that Donald Trump has.",Stormy31568,2025-04-08T22:16:25,1

"I wish these reporters would grow a spine. Imagine being called on right after she says that: “I’m not worried about the president’s spine, I’m more concerned about the backs of the working class he is breaking across America. No question.” Imagine that as a sound bite, and watching her brain melt down on live TV.",mac_duke,2025-04-09T01:59:54,6

"Let's say you buy something that is worth 100 dollars from China. Before, it would've cost 100 plus whatever tax or shipping fee was needed. Now, you'll pay an extra 104 dollars on top of that.",vampiregamingYT,2025-04-08T17:24:21,7
"The business importing the product would be required to pay 104% import tax on not just the value of the item, but also any added cost to ship it here, which is minimal.  However, the math doesn't bode well for profits that way. So, they would be forced to raise the retail price much higher to cover both the cost of making the product, shipping it, and the import tax, and still leave something left for profit.  In the case of China, if we consider they used slave labor for production, plus shipping, perhaps their total cost to produce and ship is $3 per item.  Cost of goods and shipping of $3 plus $10.40 import tax (based on a taxed value of $10.00) brings their total cost to $13.40. Now they have to raise the retail price high enough to cover that much higher cost to import here, and still make a decent profit. If they were previously paying a 20% import tax ($2.00) their profit was around $5.00. In order to maintain that same profit margin, they would need to raise the retail price up to ~$18.40 ($3.00 + $10.40 + $5.00)  This is why you hear people saying the customer ends up paying for the tariffs. In this case, your cost increased by ~80%. While you have the added expense of paying taxes to pay for tRumps taxpayer funded golf trips every few days, of approx $3 Million each and his upcoming ego trip military parade. Because his wet dream is to be as evil as Kim Jong Un.",Inevitable-Peace7,2025-04-08T17:52:09,2

"Almost.  If an importer buys a product for $100 and then adds a profit of 50, because why not, it's the only importer of said item, the consumers pay $150.  Now add $104 in tariff and the base cost goes up to $204. If the importer keeps the profit constant at $50, the consumers pay $254.   If the importers decide to try to make money off of this, and why wouldn't they, if they can get away with it, the profit ratio stays the same, so $306ish.",octafed,2025-04-08T18:51:09,7
"so, now it would be $204 for whatever widget it was.. WOOW... the orange orangutane is raw dawging everyone!  1340 some-odd days...",Beneficial-Nimitz68,2025-04-08T17:33:21,4
"Well technically it would be applied to the wholesale price paid by the importer, but we don’t know how far Chinese manufacturers can actually cut the wholesale prices to keep it competitive so importers buy it and still make money. It’ll be different for every product.",bongophrog,2025-04-08T19:50:52,2

"And if I was China, I’d add another % on as a fuck you tax. Like how some freelancers charge people who are hard to work with a higher fee than others and call it an asshole tax.",MaddyKet,2025-04-08T22:36:20,1
