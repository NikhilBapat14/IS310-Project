You don’t get it. It’s another 4D chess move. The graph was designed to resemble the dear leader’s signature.,Such-Tank-6897,2025-04-10T20:54:17,5

"This graph is up to January 2025. So nothing to do with the Trump administration, which I assume you are trying to make us think it is.",Geordieinthebigcity,2025-04-11T06:01:34,2
A lot has to do with how dense our population is in comparison which makes the R0 differ. Also I can imagine the price will go up for Canadians as birds are traveling north. Another factor is that Canadians believe in science and don't have some jackass with a worm in their brain running their health agencies..,Majestic-Plant-9708,2025-04-10T17:21:55,0

"It's also that Canada has tougher regulation on ag/food, including on animal health. The bird flu has been an open concern for several seasons (couple years ago they were quarantining zoo animals indoors during goose migrating season, even) but that also means measures have been taken to reduce the risk.    It's not that Canada is immune, but it's likely the same reason that Canada had a fraction of the excess death rate (I'm not talking absolute numbers) that the US did during Covid.    Canada has more trust in institutions, and especially now, those institutions work better. That helps in any medical crisis, human or animal.",JustAskingTA,2025-04-10T22:30:18,2
