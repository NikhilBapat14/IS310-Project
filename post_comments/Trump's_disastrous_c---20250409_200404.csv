"2 fucking days ago, the Trump cult was preaching the gospel of ‚ÄúMade in the USA,‚Äù telling us to suck it up and embrace the 2-to-5 level financial pain like it was some noble sacrifice for American manufacturing. Now? They‚Äôve done a full 180 like Will Smith zapped them with the Men in Black memory stick, worshipping Trump for pausing the very tariffs they were just calling patriotic. ‚ÄúBiggest comeback ever!‚Äù they scream, while they celebrate their modest 401k gains, like we‚Äôre all supposed to forget the whiplash-inducing hypocrisy.

"The low point yesterday hit to about where it was almost one year ago.  The gains from a few months ago are still lost, though.   Honestly, I don't think any of this was some big scheme. I think Trump realized that he, and he alone, was in way over his head and some of his big supporters were going WTF!?    I seriously doubt he is going to walk away from the tariffs, though, since not only has he believed in them for like 40 years and also believes that globalization is a zero-sum game, he is also getting advice from a few cats who believe the same.   The real question is this:  will U.S. business really start investing back into the U.S.? I mean, he seems more interested in getting foreign business to set up shop in the U.S. than he is with the home-grown option.",crucial_geek,2025-04-09T21:10:49,2
