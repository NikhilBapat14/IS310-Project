What’s fucked up is that giving birth is free if you’re illegal or on Medicaid but costs as much as a used car if you’re a responsible citizen who purchases health insurance.

"I’m tired of entitled simpletons complaining about every bit of progress because each step doesn’t solve every problem instantly.  $5,000 is a lot of money for families living paycheck to paycheck. It can pay for the car seat, crib, clothes, stroller, carrier, bassinet, toys, and still have enough leftover for a years worth of diapers.  It won’t convince someone to have a baby that didn’t already want one. But it can be an extra push for aspiring parents to have a baby sooner, rather than wait another year to save, which may ultimately result in them being able to have more kids.",dunkeater,2025-04-28T15:34:09,-12

"I think the problem is people have a recalibrated idea of a family. I came from a relatively large family, and had a good life, but we never had things like vacations or a large house for all of us, toys were only gotten on Christmas, and we’d eat out MAYBE once a month. We were comfortable though and never went without.   Now, as I have started a family, I’m happy with my two kids and being able to do all the things I didn’t get to do when I was a kid.

"1) there are too many who can't calculate long term costs and only see short term benefits.  2) We need jobs for people to work that pay well enough to afford a family  3) far too many ""experts"" fail to understand that the more you (and all the other employees) get paid, the more the product costs; this one of the main reasons you're earning more yet buying less.   The other major reason is that companies have seen profit margins remain steady or shrink while costs (both labor and materials) have grown. Prices have to increase to cover that. The costs of materials increases because all those  suppliers have to pay more for labor, and so charge more. This wage spiral is blatantly obvious, easily shown, and yet continuously denied.  4) open more refineries. Nothing affects product cost more than fuel prices for shipping; every penny spent is passed down the line. (and usually amplified) We went from 194 refineries in 2003 to 124 today; there's a net loss of over half a million barrels produced per day (decreased supply) while demand keeps rising. High school econ tells you what happens to price in that situation.   Right now, diesel runs around $4/gallon. Reduce it to $3 (by producing more) and costs will drop 25%. The lower you get it, the cheaper things will cost.

"It will only increase the birth rate among people in lower income brackets who are already on government support.  No woman who cares about a career or professional future is going to trade those for 5,000.

Hell, I never went further than about 100 miles from the house I grew up in until I was 15.  The two things I think you overlooked were convenience items and subscriptions.  The amount of money that people spend on individually packaged, ready to eat food is staggering. And much of it is devoid of any real nutritional value.

"I think the 5k would help those already doing it or aid people who want an extra kid as it takes at least that chunk off the table.   People do a lot of extra stuff they don't need to that add to the cost of raising kids. They don't need to have college funds, they can go to a CC/Trade School and finish out a 4 year degree at a small local college while working. You don't need to buy new cloths, or going to goodwill and other centers, they have cloths new with tags sold by the LB. People not wanting used toys or cloths is again, a values problem again.   Look at how people lived years ago, the houses they build, the things they had. People built lives around raising a family, not having expensive toys, keeping stuff till it broke, fixing it.   So many people these days when they are young blow money travel, experiences, dirt bikes, quads, etc. and then get surprised when they have a kid and they don't have anything saved or equity in a starter house.

I guess I'm tired of people acting like its because they can't do it because of cost, when they really mean they can't have the lifestyle they want with a kid.

">Like that's literally what people have been doing for thousands of years.  Not really.  Up until industrialization, you had piles of kids because they were free labor on the farm.

I'm fortunate to live in a state and city where a starter home in a reasonable neighborhood can be had at $150k.
