"1) there are too many who can't calculate long term costs and only see short term benefits.  2) We need jobs for people to work that pay well enough to afford a family  3) far too many ""experts"" fail to understand that the more you (and all the other employees) get paid, the more the product costs; this one of the main reasons you're earning more yet buying less.   The other major reason is that companies have seen profit margins remain steady or shrink while costs (both labor and materials) have grown. Prices have to increase to cover that. The costs of materials increases because all those  suppliers have to pay more for labor, and so charge more. This wage spiral is blatantly obvious, easily shown, and yet continuously denied.  4) open more refineries. Nothing affects product cost more than fuel prices for shipping; every penny spent is passed down the line. (and usually amplified) We went from 194 refineries in 2003 to 124 today; there's a net loss of over half a million barrels produced per day (decreased supply) while demand keeps rising. High school econ tells you what happens to price in that situation.   Right now, diesel runs around $4/gallon. Reduce it to $3 (by producing more) and costs will drop 25%. The lower you get it, the cheaper things will cost.

No woman who cares about a career or professional future is going to trade those for 5,000.

"I think the 5k would help those already doing it or aid people who want an extra kid as it takes at least that chunk off the table.   People do a lot of extra stuff they don't need to that add to the cost of raising kids. They don't need to have college funds, they can go to a CC/Trade School and finish out a 4 year degree at a small local college while working. You don't need to buy new cloths, or going to goodwill and other centers, they have cloths new with tags sold by the LB. People not wanting used toys or cloths is again, a values problem again.   Look at how people lived years ago, the houses they build, the things they had. People built lives around raising a family, not having expensive toys, keeping stuff till it broke, fixing it.   So many people these days when they are young blow money travel, experiences, dirt bikes, quads, etc. and then get surprised when they have a kid and they don't have anything saved or equity in a starter house.

I guess I'm tired of people acting like its because they can't do it because of cost, when they really mean they can't have the lifestyle they want with a kid.

">Like that's literally what people have been doing for thousands of years.  Not really.  Up until industrialization, you had piles of kids because they were free labor on the farm.
