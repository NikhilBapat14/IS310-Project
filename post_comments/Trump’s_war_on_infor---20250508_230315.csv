Librarians were always going to be the saviors.,Objective_R_549,2025-05-08T23:22:20,22
"Bless Librarians far and wide. Libraries have always been a happy place for me. Peace and quiet, and a wealth of media I could borrow for *free*. When I was little, that was books and cassette tapes. When I was in college, it was also VHS tapes. And after that, DVD’s and CD’s. Nowadays you can even rent 3-D printers. Libraries are the backbones of a community, providing access to resources many would not otherwise have, and Librarians are the stewards.",SpookySchatzi,2025-05-09T06:02:49,10

"Nope. That kind of casually aggressive bigotry is usually provided free of charge. Dumbass thinks everyone else is on a Soros payroll of some sort but doesn't realize he's mindlessly regurgitating shit that actual paid shills said first.
