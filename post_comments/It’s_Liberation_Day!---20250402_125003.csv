"Some wisdom here!  Excerpt:  The administration, I believe, is counting on the opposition to grow in strength. They welcome our rage because they’re hopeful it will lead to violence. They want violence. Don’t give it to them. Do the “Electric Slide” instead. Decorate Teslas with slices of American cheese, not swastikas. Be absurd. Be funny. Be joyful in your defiance. I write to you on Liberation Day, but liberation from this tyrant remains distant. In the meanwhile, be smart. Have a laugh. Stay safe.",D-R-AZ,2025-04-02T12:50:53,17

"Someone **please** find some excuse to interview Rand Paul & force him to give his opinion about Trump's Tariffs.  Either way, it'll be priceless. He'll either be honest & end up on Trump's shitlist... or end up having to pretend he supports something he hates more than the existence of a social safety net.",PantherkittySoftware,2025-04-02T13:35:32,5

And to hear the crowd laughing and applauding while licking his ass…knowing their stock portfolios are toast.  I’m glad I’m 80% cash right now.  https://preview.redd.it/an8ss7klgise1.jpeg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8870d0ddae3552a2201d05c18308a5824a795951,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-02T19:02:24,1
Slices of cheese won’t continue to make Teslas uninsurable.  Spray them with squirt guns filled with a mixture of water and magnesium chloride,YurtMcnurty,2025-04-02T14:12:26,6
"Do whatever you can to make the average American not paying that much attention uncomfortable with what is happening. We need to make Americans uncomfortable and the uncertainty tariffs create is a fantastic opportunity. Don't just worry about the increased costs, worry about the prospects of our allies seeking new partners. Will we be able to get those partners back in the future? Is this the beginning of the Great American Economic Slide? You should probably also worry about how Trump has made every Republican a servant of his and they control all chambers of congress, so no one will stop him. We want Americans that have never payed attention before to be hyper engaged.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-02T18:12:12,2
