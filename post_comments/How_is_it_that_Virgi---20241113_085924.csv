"A lack of new residents and the loss of economic activity impact the culture of an area  The level of US coal production in 2017 was roughly the same as it was in 1980, yet the industry then employed five times the number of workers it does today.  * [In 1948, there were 125,699 coal mining jobs in West Virginia, 168,589,033 tons of coal mined.](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-112hhrg73445/html/CHRG-112hhrg73445.htm)   * In 2010, however, only 20,452 of these jobs remained, despite the fact that almost the same amount of coal, 144,017,758 tons, had been mined.  * The 2010 Population was 1.8 million   The 1950 Population was just over 2 Million  2020 Population 1.78 million  ------ Compare that to New York City also losing its economic workhorse, in 1956   **The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was the defining feature of New York's economy.**    * It would be fair to assume that the livelihoods of half a million workers may have depended directly on the port of a total population of New York City in 1950 was 7,835,099  * [In 1956, ninety thousand manufacturing jobs within New York City were ""fairly directly"" tied to imports arriving through the Port of New York.](https://financialfreedomisajourney.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Box-How-the-Shipping-Container-Made-the-World-Smaller-and-the-World-Economy-Bigger-Marc-Levinson.pdf)  NYC 2020 Population 8.77 million",semideclared,2024-11-13T10:34:03,22
"One of the reasons that Abraham Lincoln was against slavery was economic. He felt his family, which had to move from KY because of it, had been at a disadvantage to those that got free labor to work the fields.  So not all slavery opposition was strictly moral.  I’m not saying WV was that way but certainly may have contributed .[History Channel](https://www.history.com/news/5-things-you-may-not-know-about-lincoln-slavery-and-emancipation)",31engine,2024-11-13T11:48:50,6
"Virginia has one of the [highest population of federal government employees](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/federal-government-employees-by-state) (only CA is higher) and DC itself is [extremely liberal](https://www.270towin.com/states/District_of_Columbia).  It should not come as a surprise then that those areas surrounding DC and who earn their livings working for the federal government would embrace a party that wants more spending (more government jobs).  Add in all the contractors who aren't employees but basically work for the government, it starts to make sense.  The premise of your question, however, is false.  Whether someone is conservative, liberal or what-not has almost nothing to do with the century-plus-old issue of the civil war and slavery.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-13T10:54:33,18
It's basically the 3 major cities in VA that vote blue. The rest of the state is pretty red.,sillysidebin,2024-11-13T14:31:05,4
"Because Trump has never been about left vs right. That's what the left doesn't understand -- and I'm left.  Trump got elected -- both times -- on one platform: illegals.  He just covered his main agenda under political language. He used dog whistles to talk to the people who knew it was a problem -- which apparently happens to be the majority.  But each and every time I talked to someone on the right, nothing else mattered to them but illegals. So, I began listening to Trump in 2015. Illegals was the only thing he went into any detail on. The rest was shallow conversation.  And Democrats have been saying illegals were an issue for decades. Trump was just the first to promise to fix the problem. He won by hiding his only goal under rhetoric designed to piss off his opposition, so they wouldn't dig deeper into what he was saying.",ki4jgt,2024-11-13T17:46:39,4
"I would argue there are numerous factors that lead to this outcome:  1) Black populations in the state, this is ironically a legacy of slavery, Virginia was a slave state a lot of black slaves were brought to Virginia, this lead to relatively large black populations in the state around 18%, meanwhile West Virginia has only 3% black population, black people vote predominantly Democrat.  (demographics taken from world population review)   2) Urbanisation levels, this might be the largest one, West Virginia has effectively only one relatively large town and that is Charleston-Huntington metro area. And even that is relatively small, this leads to rest of the populace being in small towns or rural areas. Meanwhile Virginia has of course NoVa (Northern Virginia is the most talked about) with cities like Arlington and Alexandria. But let's not forget about Norfolk metro area, with cities like Virginia Beach and Newport News. And then the capital Richmond itself. Virginia has quite large metro areas. Summarised Virginia has 77,6% urbanisation rate, meanwhile West Virginia has 44,6% urbanisation rate.  (urban rate brought from Wikipedia)  3) Education and end of Coal mining industry in West Virginia, West Virginia was historically a coal mining state, you don't need particularly educated workforce for that. And since the Democrats controlled the state since the coal industry collapsed there was a massive swing to the Republicans, West Virginia feels betrayed by Democrats, only around 13% of West Virginians have a college degree. Meanwhile Virginia has NoVa, NoVa is important state wide for being a service economy hub and important for federal administration, you need high education for these jobs, that's why Virginia has almost twice as large College degree graduation lying at around 25%. This again moves it to vote more Democratic.  (information from Statista)  Summarised, West Virginia votes red since it has large rural, white, uneducated population, the group that is most pro-Trump out of any demographic, meanwhile Virginia has quite large much more urbanised, much more urban population, with large amounts of black voters a code to vote Democrat.",Platinirius,2024-11-13T13:59:20,2

"At this point, I would say let's not put some hopes and expectations on to some states as people might change their beliefs and thoughts.

"People misunderstand how West Virginia became a state, it was largely a bureacratic process that was not supported by the majority of voters living in WV. If you look at the [map of the 1860 election](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/PresidentialCounty1860Colorbrewer.gif) you will see that WV voted the same as all the rest of Virginia. The vote of 1861 on Virginia's secession saw about half of [WV counties voting for secession](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Wvmapagain.png). The populous counties along the Ohio/Penn. border rejected secession and a miniature civil war took place in WV, with about equal amounts of [men going to the Confederate](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Confederate_recruitment_in_West_Virginia.jpg) and Union armies. The move to create a new state was not popular, at it's height in 1863 it brought out less than 28,000 votes, there were almost 80,000 voters in the counties. Congress and the president did not care about the low results and made it a state in 1863, with a state government that controlled less than half the state and couldn't meet it's requirements for soldiers. The new state government held on until 1872 when full voting rights were restored and they were swept from office. Former Confederates were elected and a new state constitution was written along the lines of the old Virginia constitution.  The development of Virginia as it was progressing west at the start of the war was disrupted, the WV state government was more vulnerable to influence and corruption and the natural resources of the region were [controlled by outsides interests](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Confederate_recruitment_in_West_Virginia.jpg). That system stayed in place until the failure of the coal industry, which did not build infrastructure or sustainable communities once they had left.",Ooglebird,2024-11-15T10:28:24,1

"> Whether someone is conservative, liberal or what-not has almost nothing to do with the century-plus-old issue of the civil war and slavery.  This is the most salient point. While those who support the Confederacy or have an affinity for the South in 2024 are likely to be conservative, most conservatives don't care whatsoever about the issue or are more likely to be on the side of the ""Union.""   I know many conservatives who were glad to see statues come down during 2020 and who are disgusted at Confederate flags. It's not really a partisan question.",SeekingTheRoad,2024-11-13T12:53:09,6

"WV has a negative population growth  * So not only are new people not moving there.  *   For every family that has kids, the kids are leaving  But of course some people do move there, and that means even people that used to live there and are not kids are also moving out  So if only people that want to be there or move there...it reinforces its culture as a red state  But thats because WV hasnt invested in a coal transformation, with things like cultural changes impacting voters  The easiest has been Tourism & Film and Movie Production   * Both bring in new residents for jobs in the Industries.  And those jobs tend to be people that are more creative and younger  That means more liberal voters  ----- Film tax incentives in New York State, (NYC) entertainment industry.   * Empire State Film Production Tax Credit. * Empire State Film Post-Production Tax Credit. * New York State Commercial Tax Credit. * New York City Musical and Theatrical Tax Credit. * Empire State Musical and Theatrical Production Tax Credit.  New York recently raised its dollar cap from $400 million to $700 million  * The tax break can be considerable.   * It covers up to 30% of a film’s qualified production costs,  * with another 10% available if productions are filmed in certain counties north of New York City.   * The credit is also refundable, meaning the state pays out the excess money if it exceeds a film production’s tax bill.  Thus, lots of shows filmed in New York and lots of Film jobs for people to move to New York for  WV hasnt done that",semideclared,2024-11-14T18:33:40,3
