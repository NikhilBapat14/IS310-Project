"I would argue it started with the Tea Party. That was when conservatives saw the total failure of Bush not as a flaw of conservatism, but rather a mistake of conservatism having any respect for liberal democracy. That's when the GOP began openly promoting they wanted the president to fail, where Party over Country first became an semi-official platform.  Then, the stacking of SCOTUS required the GOP to officially endorse hypocrisy as well. I mean all politicians are hypocrites but I'm not sure history has a bolder example of an American party swearing by one principle just to swear by the opposite a few years later.   By Trump's first term, Republicans in Congress who spent six years condemning a security breach that left a handful of people dead in an embassy in one of the most dangerous parts of the world, suddenly refuse to convict on an impeachment of their own guy no matter what.   Then followed the Republican courts, which spent the entire Biden Admin plainly striking down laws based on what letter is in parentheses next to the name of who signed it.",heelspider,2025-05-05T08:27:49,172
I wonder when people will start blaming “the people following these executive orders”  Trump is a buffoon but those who adhere to these executive orders like they are law are criminals and traitors to the constitution and are ushering in the seizure of power by the executive branch.

"My entire life I’ve grown up in the shadow of the US here in Canada. It’s nearly impossible to escape the media, and the bravado, nationalism, and American exceptionalism of the US is palpable and always has been. It’s annoying at times, actually fucking hilarious at times, and now… disappointing. Through American media, either passively or aggressively, we’ve been assured, beyond a doubt, that Americans will not suffer tyranny and they have a whole amendment to their constitution that ensures they are armed and ready to fight back.   And then voted in a fascist. What a fucking shame.",Unit_79,2025-05-05T11:12:19,4
"While I agree in some aspects, every time I try to think through ""'where all this started"", I run into a bottomless pit. Bush II pulled some seriously shady shit, and ignored the will of the electorate, or at least openly and blatantly manipulated it. The ""we create reality"" speech was chilling at the time.  And then Reagan pretty much got away with whatever he wanted to get away with; as long as his folksy charm held out he was pretty much untouchable. Then Nixon, who is unique in having seen consequences. Then if you are looking for bad behavior committed in the US directed at citizens, you do have to go back aways, but if you are looking for criminality on the world stage, it's pretty blatant and common, though we rarely talk about it in the US. Something like 64 governments overthrown on US orders after WWII...and then of course we had a hand in a lot of rotten stuff between the wars, and before WWI there was a decided and openly talked about shift to imperialism, similar to what we had at the last election. The more you look the more you find.   Anyway, if the US is sliding toward fascism and isolated nationalism, and the world is shifting toward more liberal governments to distance itself, it is possible to see a coherent long-term trend where all this was inevitable, and that it might be a very good thing that the veil is lifted and the world is waking up. Of course that's not the narrative you get in school, but the main reason it seems so unprecedented is how firmly the normal ""we're the good guys"" narrative is embedded in our psyches.  And I'd add on edit - while most of the perpetrators on the list are GOP, and there was often strong resistance from the other side of the aisle, but almost never were heinous actions reversed when the opposition got back in. One example one of my history professors gave was about one of the worst things the US government ever did - the Indian Displacement Act, under Andrew Jackson (Trump's favorite president), which led to the Trail of Tears and all that. The Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, but Jackson didn't give a shit, and it all went forward anyway. Opposing parties made a big fuss and outcry, but when Jackson was out and they were in they fixed nothing.",dxrey65,2025-05-05T11:31:31,5

"I don’t think it’ll ever be “bad enough” for the American populace to overthrow Trump. Too many extremely powerful people manipulating all facets of the American system. So many departments are already dismantled to a state that it would take a different authoritarian to rebuild them in any semblance of time. Apathy will take over while slices of political dissidents are removed from concern one way or another.

"It's not like anyone is really trying to stop him, so it's no surprise he gets to push through his authoritarian agenda at record speed. Everyone is too scared to act out, and that fear is exactly what Trump needs as a dictator.   I see a lot of people saying that Trump is waiting for an excuse to enact martial law, and therefore there's not much in the way of resisting that can be done. Yet people fail to realize that this attitude means that Trump has already won. Trump is perfectly content with you just sitting quietly in your home, letting him do whatever he wants, without any sort of pushback. Hence the rapid decline of the US. If/when Trump wants martial law, it's going to happen regardless of what you do.  For all the complaining people do about Trump, the American people are just letting it happen.",Turtle-Express,2025-05-05T12:37:31,2

"One potential bulwark we have left is that while they share much in common Trumpism, unlike Fascism, disdains bureaucracy. Typically, authoritarian states take control of the bureaucracy and redirect it toward their aims. But Trumpism more resembles kakistrocracy and it routinely bumps into actual mechanistic challenges to its agenda that no one operating seems to care about.   To whit, arguably the most ""successful"" initiative Trump 2 has taken is the aggressive spectacle of deportation, but by the numbers, they are not deporting at a greater rate than previous administrations and are currently embroiled in several legal battles over the various ways that they've been fucking it up. Similarly, Dear Leader announced tariffs on foreign movies last night despite there being no actual mechanism to enforce it and despite his authority to impose tariffs literally excluding things like media. We can say it doesn't matter or we can actually make them define exactly what they are doing and how, the latter they have shown to resoundingly not have any particular competence or patience for  It's easy to say well Trump Smash! and appeal to a sort of lawless nihilism but the greater point is that without the bureaucracy, the actual resilience of Trumpism and its ability to actually make meaningful realignments is limited by reality itself. A more typical fascist state would move through the bureaucracy and systemically engrave its authority within it. But Trumpism, and its adherents, simply do not care. They think everything just happens somehow and don't have any particular interest in how or why.   Of course, that's still broadly hypothetical though, maybe Trumpism redefines our understanding of collapse and truly nothing actually mattered. But it is not a foregone conclusion that just because it has adopted the trappings of an authoritative state, that it is automatically to be a successful one.",ckglle3lle,2025-05-05T11:37:22,1

"While it is looking more and more likely that this administration could possibly collapse in on itself, don’t take this as an excuse to get complacent. Everyone should start preparing for the worst case scenario and take steps to start resisting a future authoritarian regime (not to sound accusatory towards the commenter, just hijacking the top comment for visibility).  Here’s some ideas of things you can do in the short term if you’re unsure of what to do.  - Join a mutual aid group. You can Google “mutual aid groups near me” or something like that. Start offering help with whatever you’re able to in order to start building a support network. - Join a protest, but more importantly make at least one connection with someone there (the more the merrier though). Similar to the mutual aid group, you want to start building a network of like minded individuals if shit starts getting more serious. - Learn a skill. First aid, sewing clothes, DIY home repair, etc. Learn and practice something that will be useful to a group if essential services become unavailable. - Get informed. Read books (and watch videos too, but I’d challenge you to stick to mediums that can’t be shut off or easily controlled) about how to resist an authoritarian regime. “On Tyranny” by Timothy Snyder is an easy to read and well structured book that also gives a lot of other sources you can refer to after you’re done., but just get yourself as informed as possible while hopefully weaning yourself from relying on the internet for information. - This one’s a bit controversial, but if you’re not opposed to arming yourself, start doing so and start stockpiling ammunition. Hit the practice range regularly and train. There’s a large community of liberal gun owners out there, but if you can’t find any, just train at the conservative places. Most places will generally leave to your own devices as long as you’re not actively starting trouble.",onmamas,2025-05-05T10:42:40,12

">  Seem like the day of reckoning is coming soon, maybe even within a few months from now.  There will be no such clear moment.  > But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.   And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.

Holding State and Local Officials Accountable. The Attorney General shall pursue all necessary legal remedies and enforcement measures to enforce the rights of Americans impacted by crime and shall prioritize prosecution of any applicable violations of Federal criminal law with respect to State and local jurisdictions whose officials: (a)  willfully and unlawfully direct the obstruction of criminal law, including by directly and unlawfully prohibiting law enforcement officers from carrying out duties necessary for public safety and law enforcement”  This appears to allow Trump to have judges arrested for calling out and hindering Trumps illegal and unconstitutional actions. Any judge that orders the release of those in custody of ICE or even police can now be arrested.   As others have pointed out, a major hallmark of the rise of fascism is trying to give the illusion of law and order by making what they’re doing seem legal.

I see SO MUCH chinese propaganda being posted lately (if you head over to /r/Europe, 6 months ago everyone was very anti-china, then after Trump got elected, suddenly almost every thread is stuffed with upvoted comments saying how we should totally make allies with China now and also drop sanctions on Russia and how we should cut all diplomatic ties with the US).  There's also a WEALTH of nothing-burger articles posted, where it's pretty much just a made up headline that everyone is talking about, with nothing really actually happening.

" >What is their “enough is enough” line?  In no particular order:  * The dissolution or deposition of a state government, likely one going against Trump * Federal military opening fire on protesters, regardless of whether the protesters are peaceful or not * Mass arrest of judges; state (see the first bullet) or federal  * Mass economic hardship; e.g. total collapse of state economies, to the point where there is no food in grocery stores or gas at the stations, so many people cannot pay rent or mortgage that there aren't enough judges to process evictions or police to enforce the evictions, and/or ATMs literally run out of cash and people switch to barter and/or crypto or a foreign currency. Etc. * Actual concentration camps, but on ""continental, lower 48"" American soil, including the mass arrests of entire neighborhoods that would require to fill them (spot of good news: without a robust rail network, that will make transporting this many prisoners *much* more difficult, especially to inaccessible places). Alternatively: walled-off ghettos, like the one in Warsaw.  There are probably also other scenarios in not timing of, but you get the gist.  Right now, all the ""erosion"" is on paper to most Americans. It's happening, but hasn't affected their daily lives or quality life *just yet*. It *will*, but not yet, so only those paying attention and who can see where this leads are fighting right now. Once it impacts those who aren't paying attention, or aren't smart enough or well educated enough to see where this leads, or humble enough and wise enough to follow those smarter and better informed than then, *then* you'll see those red lines get crossed for entire populations.   It's also important to remember that the US has 50 separate national guards, each with an army and air force. Each national guard reports to their state's governor (and the president, but there is no guarantee that these national guards would listen to the president over their governors in any of the above scenarios). And each guard is as well equipped as the US federal branches (F-22s, F-35s, Abrams, Howitzers, etc). But their use in these ways would literally be a civil war (it's what happened last time there was an American civil war. And in the American Revolution).  And on top of all this, there is American private gun ownership. And it's not as ""the conservatives own all the guns"" as people think. For example, highly progressive and gun-restrictive Massachusetts has an ownership rate of 1/4 homes. Meanwhile, neighboring, conservative and gun-permissive New Hampshire has an ownership rate of around 1/7 homes. So, while conservative gun owners in the US are certainly louder, it would be a mistake to assume they own even a majority of the guns.  Are we on a bad trajectory? Yes. Has damage been already done to an extent that it will take decades to recover? Yes. Is it unrecoverable, with dictatorship all but assured at this point? No.",McFlyParadox,2025-05-05T12:11:19,1
"The Republicans will see increased power, so they're supporting Trump. This is a marriage between MAGA, Christian nationalists, Republicans (mostly all far-right anyway), and tech billionaires. But the first 3 categories I listed are a pretty tight venn diagram (severe overlap). The tech billionaires and other libertarian power brokers have pretty extreme overlapping interests with the Republicans. In fact most of what's written in Project 2025 (the grand plan that we're witnessing unfold that was published in 2023) paraphrases, if not directly quotes, the books and proclamations of Neo-Libertarian Techno-Feudalists, or as they call themselves anti-democratic anti-liberal neo-reactionary monarchist neocameralists (CEO kings with absolute power within their domains). These are the wealthiest men in the world organizing a coup with Trump as their vehicle, and there's no push back whatsoever - only unflinching support by Republicans because ALL of their priorities have been baked into the Libertarian agenda.  And in case it's confusing how libertarians are (and always have been) authoritarian, seemingly a contradiction, you must read their books or listen to their podcasts and realize who the freedoms are for. The freedoms are for there to be no taxes, therefore no government infrastructure and no social safety nets. Being liberated of our labor laws, etc. The freedom and liberty for anyone to do anything they want in business. Everything becomes a contract and a deal. And those who aren't wealthy or can't contribute high value in a society (engineers, doctors) are considered ""nonproductive"" and ""irrelevant."" And this gets more stark as AI displaces humans because economically speaking, humans will be considered more and more obsolete. And in a libertarian worldview, the only charity they should receive should be if some of the trillionaires choose to provide resources out of their own good will or self interest to the obsolete, irrelevant humans. And such charity would be very inconsistent and unpredictable if it even exists.  The richest and most powerful men in the world are leading the most powerful \[currently seated\] party in the world with the most powerful man in the world controlling the most powerful military that has ever existed.

But none of the extermination camps were located in the middle of the German Reich proper. As far as German citizens were concerned, Jews were simply ""relocated"" East. Sure, that was a flimsy cover, and anyone who wanted to know whether or not millions of innocent civilians were mass murdered in an industrial genocide could have known - but it provided the regime the same kind of cover that the current ""let's just deport undesirables to El Salvador"" provides to the Trump regime.",paintbucketholder,2025-05-05T10:17:42,15

">That 4 million voters were wrongfully purged  >independent reputable journalist/analyst who backs his claim that the election was stolen through widespread voter suppression at the levels he claims they were.   Okay. Here goes.  [Brennan Centre for Justice](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-september-2024) - 30 states enacted 78 laws to restrict voter access;   >The race-targeted laws ran the gamut from shuttering drop boxes in Black-majority cities to, for the first time, allowing non-government self-appointed “vote fraud vigilantes” to challenge voters by the hundreds of thousands.

Used Advanced Address List Hygiene, applied by 5 independent expert firms to hundreds of sources to determine a wrongful purge rate of 63%. This is for the last election where we have all available data.

This is a lot to take in.  The long and short of it though is that this is a huge problem which has been going on for years. A map of the states which have had legislation restricting voting laws and a map of the states which won Trump the election is an overlay, to put it into a concise way of thinking about what has happened here.  And the years we have complete and thorough data for show a clear and massive trend of increased wrongful voter purges, even prior to the massive flurry of vote suppression legislation seen in the last 4 years",FilthBadgers,2025-05-05T16:48:23,1
