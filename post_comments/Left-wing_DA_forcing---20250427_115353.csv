Or…hear me out… just don’t commit crime in the first place?   Must be impossible to comprehend for them.,theycalllmeTIM,2025-04-27T12:43:09,15
"I might be an idiot making assumptions about legal issues I have no qualifications commenting on, but doesn't the court system picking and choosing which cases to give plea deals to based on the race of the accused run afoul of the civil rights act, which presumably limits where and how the government can discriminate against people of protected classes? Assuming of course that they receive federal funding.  Because I'm pretty sure it does, and this DA is literally proposing racism.  Or more likely the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.  The problem with this kind of policy making is I'm pretty every case touched by this policy might become damaged goods because every person who might have been refused a plea deal has standing to sue.  Literally all they had to do is just be impartial and treat all suspects the same.  edit: I just took a looksy at the twin cities subreddit and pretty much everyone regardless of political background agrees this DA is making an absurd decision that will probably lead to lawsuits. Have fun getting sued by a Caucasian presenting felon who's affected by the memo.",atomic1fire,2025-04-27T16:36:56,6
