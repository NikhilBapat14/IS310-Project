"The problem is the treaty on refugee.   If a refugee or landed immigrant in the US tries to cross into Canada to claim refugee sultans here, they are axmstically deported to the country of initial landing, most often the US.    For obvious reasons, many refugees in the us are trying to escape to Canada before they are sent to a gulag because they have a tattoo saying “I heart mom”. An obvious ms13 tattoo according to the goose stepping ICE gestapo.  Canada is most likely reviewing this treaty behind closed doors, but until it is amended or paused, they are holding to the existing agreement out of obligation.  Given how many times the US has burned Canada over extradition treaties, and the abandonment of legal procedures for those sent to the concentration camp, I expect a massive overhaul.",Random-Name-7160,2025-04-25T03:06:57,4

"It’s both. We have turned away people with asylum status in the US who now, want to transition to Canada. People in that situation are being denied entry on the Canadian side, but there are also people who take a wrong turn who have no legal status in the US.  I will say though, as someone who crosses at both Detroit crossings multiple times a week, I’m not really sure how you come to Canada by mistake. I mean there are signs everywhere. You have to ignore a lot of stuff to cross by mistake. I suppose if you don’t read English you may miss some, but a lot of them have a Canadian flag on them.   My only question is what was happening before. Dealing with CPB as often as I do, I can not imagine someone with no legal status crossing the border by mistake, trying to come back into the US and them going “Yup, no problem, have a nice day”. Either more people are crossing into Canada by mistake now, or stories that were happening before were ignored and are now being brought to light.  I can assure you that 95%+ of what is happening with CBP now is stuff they have always done. It’s not new. There’s just a spotlight on it now because of the other things going on with Immigration. People had no idea what was happening. I know this by the number of people who have rarely if ever dealt with CBP are shocked while those of us who have been doing this day in and day out for years are looking at most of this going “yeah, that’s what was going to happen”. It hasn’t been the way people think of it in over 25 years, and even then it was only partially like that.  If people do not like what is happening at the border today, then they should vote for reform. Not sure how far you’ll get though because this is still about securing the respective nation, and you do not want rules that are too lax, or you end up with 9/11 again.   I will say this, I would not want their job. I have no idea how you properly vet people and secure a nation without  upsetting people. You’re going to do things like check for drugs, or weapons, or whatever and sometimes you’re going to be wrong. When you are wrong, people are going to crucify you. It’s a tough situation and one I’m glad I don’t have to worry about.",imcclelland,2025-04-25T06:08:09,-4
