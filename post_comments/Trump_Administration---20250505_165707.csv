"The only reason he is opposing it is because it is trying to restrict the FDA power to regulate across states. If he allows this to occur, the judicial system could remove some of the power held by his administration which he cannot allow. I am sure he is not actually endorsing abortion medication in general, but states regulation of FDA approved medications.",WhimsicalBookVoyager,2025-05-05T17:08:15,27
I always found Trump's support of the anti-abortion movement rather ironic given that he's probably made a number of his mistresses over the decades have abortions. ,Creative_Recover,2025-05-05T17:12:03,13
"There are some cynical arguments that could be made as to why they would do this, but I think the most basic of them works best;     They remember what Roe v. Wade did them - someone with a brain figured out that functionally outlawing abortion like this would likely go *much* worse.",ParagonFury,2025-05-05T17:13:33,3
I’m speechless. I agree with the Trump administration.,duyogurt,2025-05-05T16:59:43,4

"This is classic waffle.  Trump has endorsed numerous anti-abortion policies including revering himself as the “conception president” or the “president that defeated abortion” and “sent it back to the states.”  If Trump is asking for this case to be dismissed it’s because some other part of it has ramifications and will derail his plans elsewhere.  Or he’s powdering his nose to try and distance himself to the number of women deaths slowly piling up from uncertain abortion policies (see: Texas, Georgia, Louisiana).",Cferretrun,2025-05-05T18:03:15,5
"Why are you crying about upvotes?   >I know Daddy Trump is ruining the economy, but at least he’s trying to dismiss a random court case! Give him upvotes!!! Why aren’t you upvoting Daddy Trump!!!",JewsieJay,2025-05-05T18:44:39,3
