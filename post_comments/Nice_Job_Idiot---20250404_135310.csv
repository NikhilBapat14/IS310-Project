I just sent a text to my dad because when Biden was elected he told me that my retirement would be eaten away. It actually nearly doubled. And in 3 months with Trump its lost around 8%. So I reminded him that he told me that.,Clearbay_327_,2025-04-04T14:52:47,57

They're saying it's good that the stock market is going down, and now is a good time to buy stocks. They think Trump is hooking us up to make us all richer.      That is literally the same level of critical thinking as a turkey. Like, were the stock markets artificially high back in the 50s and 60s during the age of American prosperity? Did we need a brainless donkey in the oval office back then to tank the stock market and make us all richer?",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-04T14:39:15,42
