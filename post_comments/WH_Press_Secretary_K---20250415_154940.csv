"It's also mind boggling how many ""fellow conservatives"" keep defending and parroting propaganda about this guy in every post about the subject in this sub.",JediGeek,2025-04-15T23:49:35,48
"Matthew Foldi: What does the administration think about the priorities we're seeing from Senate Democrats in terms of illegal immigrants, instead of the work that agencies like ICE and DHS are doing with the Trump Administration?   .   Leavitt: It's mind boggling the priorities of the modern day Democrat party. I think it's atrocious that you have Democrats in Congress on Capitol Hill, who swear an oath to protect their constituents and to serve them in Washington DC, spending more time to defending illegal immigrant gang members than their own constituents and law abiding American citizens like Rachel Morin.  And I saw the President personally on the campaign trail, and I continue to see him, in his role as President of the United States, put American families first, reach out to the victims, the families of victims at the hands of illegal immigrant crime, and frankly, the actions and the words of the Democrat prove they could not care less about the American public, and maybe if they did, they'd see a bit higher approval ratings.  .  https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1912199992590168533",Ironman650,2025-04-15T15:51:09,7

I think it’s gone further than that: the D’s seem to be hell bent on doing the exact opposite of what the WH  is trying to do. They don’t care about cause and effect.,MaBonneVie,2025-04-15T18:54:47,-2
"Democrats don't care about solving crime. They believe that if you solve crime without first giving everyone free housing and food and healthcare, you've cheated. What Bukele did to fix El Salvador is heretical in their eyes.  It doesn't matter if the people criminals harm most are typically the working class and other downtrodden groups. They don't care-- the intellectual leaders are well-off academics who are insulated from the consequences. They want everyone to feel the pain.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-15T17:23:53,-8
