"You would think so, but no. Yesterday, I chatted on Facebook with a MAGA woman whom I grew up with. She said she just got back from shopping, and prices are down. I showed her links and even a graph showing that this isn't the case. She still insisted that wasn't true. She used to bitch about prices when Biden was in office. MAGA is unreachable, and believes everything their orange pissdaddy says.",LolAtAllOfThis,2025-05-05T14:07:54,66

" “Once someone becomes a leader of the high Right Wing Authoritarians’ in-group (high meaning scores high on RWA test/Right Wing meaning personality traits not political description), he can lie with impunity about the out-groups, himself, whatever, because he knows the followers will seldom check on what he says, nor will they expose themselves to people who set the record straight. Furthermore they will not believe the truth if they somehow get exposed to it, and if the distortions become absolutely undeniable, they will rationalize it away and put it in a box. If the scoundrel’s duplicity and hypocrisy lands him on the front page of every daily in the country, the followers will still forgive him if he just says the right things” writes Bob Altemeyer, a retired Professor in Psychology and expert on Authoritarianism, in his free, excellent, and often funny book ‘The Authoritarians’.  https://theauthoritarians.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/TheAuthoritarians.pdf",Rfalcon13,2025-05-05T14:14:39,27

"Ya and I forgot to mention in my post that the only reason its this low is because OPEC said they're going to boost supply in June. OPEC is about the only entity that can affect the global oil prices. Its a global commodity, our output practically means nothing in the grand scheme of things so without really something overly drastic, a president can't do shit to make prices lower (without subsidies).",boomb0xx,2025-05-05T18:17:52,6

"Gasoline is a global commodity, there isn't a strong correlation with prices and the economy. If anything, there is usually an inverse trend where oil prices are usually lower during a stronger economy and vice versa though there are so many factors to this you can't really claim one thing over another.",boomb0xx,2025-05-06T08:14:52,1
