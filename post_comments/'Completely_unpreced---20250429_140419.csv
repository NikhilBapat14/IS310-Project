"This is where we‚Äôre headed, from 1984:  Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no word for ""Science."" The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of lngsoc. And even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse and plows while books are written by machinery. But in matters of vital importance - meaning, in effect, war and police espionage - the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least tolerated.",skeevev,2025-04-29T15:07:19,46

"Yeah.  I am rereading it now. The book was written in 1948 and so a lot of the details are wrong, but it is  spot on in may ways.  Orwell talks about:  \* changing the language (the official language, ""Newspeak"") to control how people think.  Not  dissimilar to banning certain words.   \* changing the records of the past to match the official narrative. They are doing this by insisting that what we know if the past is wrong, even blaming Biden for programs that Trump instituted, and by treating anyone that reports the actual truth, such as Amazon wanting to include the line item ""tariffs,"" while the official line is that foreign countries pay these.",skeevev,2025-04-29T16:23:37,21
"The thing of it is, that shit isn‚Äôt going to fly for the roughly 1/2 to 2/3 of the country that aren‚Äôt die hard trumpers.   He‚Äôs reached the diminishing returns part of doubling down on lying.   Corporate media may have the loudest narrative but people still have the internet, free speech, and the freedom to criticize the government, assemble and practice their own religion (or abstain).   We are a much less homogenous society than WWII Germany. Trump‚Äôs brand of authoritarianism may appeal to the more weak minded citizens in the Redder parts of the country but it will never own this country.   This administration will go down as a skid mark in American History.",Infinitehope42,2025-04-29T18:38:40,7
