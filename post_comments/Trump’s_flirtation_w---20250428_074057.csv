It is not even a flirtation. It is just completely fucking empty words. Words he already said were meaningless because even though he falsely claimed he wanted to do it he said right then and there he would not.,Deinosoar,2025-04-28T07:42:01,21
To the surprise of nobody. The Trump administration has been promising to cut income taxes and fund the cost of those  cuts through a tax on goods (tariffs). The whole scheme that Trump has been promoting is to download costs onto the working class in order to inflate the net worth of the ultra wealthy. A tax increase on the rich flies in the face of that ideology. ,legocastle77,2025-04-28T07:51:42,5
"Norquist vs Trump  Is there any question that Trump wins? Yes it’s against everything that republicans have stood for in the vast 50 years. But we also know that republican politicians are spineless. So, go home Grover. Leopards, faces, etc",xyz_rick,2025-04-28T07:51:22,4

It's crazy that this article isn't just mocked out of print. Republicans saying that they support raising taxes on high income earners to give a break to middle class? They haven't done Anything to support the middle class in nearly half a century without kicking and screaming. This is pure lip service because they are scared from the backlash due to their utter failure of policies by following Trump.,pistachiopudding,2025-04-28T08:32:24,2
