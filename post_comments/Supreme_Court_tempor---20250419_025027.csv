This story broke after midnight. SCOTUS is keeping late hours on Easter Weekend.   Only Alito and Thomas voted against the order.,clamorous_owle,2025-04-19T02:54:56,22
"When are we going to hold him up to the constitution. His powers are clearly stated there, as is scotus’. He is defying scotus that’s defying the constitution that he swore to uphold. The aliens enemy act is a wartime power and Congress has not declared war. Again he is overriding the constitution which gives the sole right to declare war to Congress not the presidency.",Bakingsquared80,2025-04-19T09:25:33,7
Will Trump accept it?,anu-nand,2025-04-19T08:12:15,1
"Trump will just have the planes do a little 360 loop over the ocean, say that each deportation was briefly paused, and claim that he is in compliance with the order. We gave them all a pause! What more could you want?",mostlynights,2025-04-19T10:59:02,1
The two who have the most to 'gain' from rightwing extremism. Summer vacation about to start!!!,YallerDawg,2025-04-19T06:54:51,9
"We're in uncharted territory. There's no ""group,"" other than Congress, to hold him responsible. Congress won't do it because they agree with it. We're very close to a Constitutional crisis, if not there already.",VintageLV,2025-04-19T09:40:54,3
"My guess is no, and those planes will be in the air later today",itsaquagmire,2025-04-19T09:23:29,4
He won't even bother to do that. SCOTUS gave him immunity. Their rulings mean fuck all anymore.,BustAMove_13,2025-04-20T02:53:09,1
It's RV time!!! Big ol' honkin' GOP-bought extremist justices RV time!,Zestyclose_Pickle511,2025-04-20T14:42:01,1
The military is supposed to do it. They don’t swear to a particular party but to uphold the constitution,Bakingsquared80,2025-04-19T10:00:02,6
"Hopefully someone has the sense to challenge that ruling, because this lunacy has gone on long enough. It’s almost funny *almost* (but not at all) that despite this clown being crystal clear about his intentions, they handed him everything he wanted anyway. Now he’s doing exactly what he said he would, and they’re clutching their pearls in surprise. We really are living in the dumbest possible timeline.",Excellent_Pirate8224,2025-04-20T07:58:58,2
