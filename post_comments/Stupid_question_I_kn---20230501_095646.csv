"It means that the government is actually getting directly involved, which can take several forms depending on the situation.",Naliamegod,2023-05-15T17:46:11,2
"State interference doesn't have an objective definition. To understand why, consider that the entire *purpose* of a state is to 'interfere'. We creates states collectively to coordinate actions amongst ourselves - and that means that someone is inevitably going to find themselves on the ""don't wanna do that"" end of that coordination at any given time.  For example, I want to drive my Ferrari at 200 mph down Sunset Boulevard. But then I'm faced with the ""state interference"" of police officers who disapprove of operating motor vehicles at their intended design limits.  So when we use the term ""state interference"", it's more subjective. It means that we don't view that *particular* use of state power as appropriate, often in a fundamental way. For example, many people in the U.S. disapprove of ""state interference"" in abortion because they don't view it as the proper role of government to dictate the availability of an otherwise safe medical procedure.",ViskerRatio,2023-05-19T08:55:52,1
