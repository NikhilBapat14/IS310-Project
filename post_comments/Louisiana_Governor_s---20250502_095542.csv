The soda lobby is so powerful in this country that it's tricked people into thinking that the government **not** subsidizing Coca-Cola is an infringement on personal freedom.,Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-02T11:11:55,600
"My daughter works for a grocery store and has people come in every day buying junk with food stamps and cigarettes and alcohol with cash.   I’m all for social safety nets but food stamps should be used for food with nutritional value.

"Fully support this.  Welfare and other support programs need to be systems to get you through hardship, not live on.  This is to make sure you don't go hungry. Period.  The essentials.

Illinois used to have it where you couldn't buy junk food or super expensive luxury like stuff. They changed it like 20 years ago. Now they can get any food and drink but alcohol and non food items.
