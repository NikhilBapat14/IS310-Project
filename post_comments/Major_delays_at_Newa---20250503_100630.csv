"I was banned from r/aviation for suggesting that in this political environment maybe the respect we have for the FAA and NTSB's ability to execute their jobs should be reevaluated given the political climate they've been thrust into and the pressure everyone there has on them to fall into line and make this administration look good at all costs.  Shortly after because this was a common sentiment, the mods posted that if you apologize, agree to their no politics rule, and never bring it up again they will unban you.  But I'm not going to apologize for shit. There are clear and obvious ways in which this turmoil has affected air travel in the United States and to take a ""no politics"" position might as well be putting your hands over your ears like a kindergartener going ""Nyahh nah nah, I can't hear you."" Maybe the sky isn't falling and everything that falls out of the sky isn't this administration's fault, but there is a clear and present danger that worsens by the day.",Boomshtick414,2025-05-04T00:05:27,8

"It’s more complicated than that. For instance, the Reagan airport crash may have contributing factors related to the pilots, or to ATC. But the organizations within the FAA and department of transportation that created the policies, and the waivers from those policies, that allow it to be “normal” for a helicopter to pass within 75 feet of an airliner are far removed from ATC.  An airspace design organization designs the airspace, creates the procedures, and issues a series of directions called “technical orders” that are regulatory in nature.  They create LOAs, (letters of agreement) between adjacent ATC facilities to make sure there’s coordination and coverage with no gaps.  And the role of ATC and pilots is to follow those directives, and in most cases following them is mandatory.",ArrowheadDZ,2025-05-03T13:31:40,5

">But the organizations within the FAA and department of transportation that created the policies, and the waivers from those policies, that allow it to be “normal” for a helicopter to pass within 75 feet of an airliner are far removed from ATC.   FAA/USDOT only allowed that unsafe helicopter route so that the army could fly VIPs around. They would never allow such a tight clearance without political pressure from above. ",css555,2025-05-03T15:10:29,3

"Agreed but I think the cause/effect is the opposite.  That is, political pressure has been steadily applied to permit ridiculous airline operations.  Reagan conducts roughly the same number of operations one runway at a time as Dulles performs on 3 simultaneous runways on 13,000 acres.  And National was designed before the jet engine, and built before Pearl Harbor.  It was built at a time when the daily traffic would have been tens of DC3 and Boeing 247 flights.  Politicians want an easier way to get in and out of the Capitol and so they’ve allowed/pushed for all kinds of absolutely absurd waivers.m for decades now.  Not even the Blue Angels or the Thunderbirds do crossing maneuvers with 75 feet of separation until several months into their seasonal certification, and yet we have have 24 year old commuter jet FOs performing this same operation at night.  It’s almost as if nothing could go wrong.",ArrowheadDZ,2025-05-03T19:57:42,1
