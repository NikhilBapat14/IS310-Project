"""No environmental delays because we defunded the EPA!""  Sometimes I allow myself to feel fear when he opens his mouth about destroying the environment and realize everything is going to be okay(ish)  I don't think companies are going to risk setting up their pollutive shop here. The protests of the 70s, discovery of cheaper wood elsewhere (for better or for worse) and environmental groups suing the shit out of logging companies slowed down the logging industry in America drastically. Trump can stand on his podium and go ""hell yeah chop down all our forests!"" But it's not going to happen, and if some company TRIES to make it happen they are going to meet huge backlash.    Same with coal, he can go ""hell yeah black lung is back on the menu boys!"" But coal plants are still shutting down, many even closed down under his first term. Coal mines are closing down or are proposed to close down, and even if he pledges to prop them up with popsicle sticks, they are going to face huge backlash and lawsuits from environmental groups, that is, if someone wants to stick in with the effort with natural gas being cheaper.    Any company that tries to set up shop here is going to quickly find out that environment groups aren't going to play nice.",TyrannicalKitty,2025-04-09T15:19:54,1
