"The exact same politicians who've spent the past 3 years hyperventilating that providing aid to Ukraine was going to cause WW3 and end up with American boots on the ground would happily send our soldiers to fight WW3 if Israel asked them to.

Man how are they going to manage a war with Iran whilst also keeping China at bay in the South China sea. This is just monumentally stupid. Focus on ONE thing Trump..please. for the love of God! The man is an adhd nightmare in the form of a human. Focus! Take your meds. Stop antagonizing countries so they don't ALL become a threat simultaneously.
