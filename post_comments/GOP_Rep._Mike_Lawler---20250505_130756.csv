"Excuse me, but why *wouldn't* I be allowed to record a Town Hall?  If you are that uncomfortable being recorded as a public servant, resign and slither back under the rock you came from.",jlaine,2025-05-05T14:23:40,69

The GOP has become irrelevant.  They do nothing to hold the administration to account.  They enable all the bad behaviour and  erosion of peoples rights.,Troubled202,2025-05-05T14:02:20,15
Isn't this the one where they mobbed an older lady and literally carried her out because she spoke up?,whoibehmmm,2025-05-05T14:35:19,11

Shaming those who have no shame is impossible.  We just have to remove those toxic assholes from power in the midterms.,The-M0untain,2025-05-05T15:13:53,4
This is exactly why we will see fewer town halls  from elected Conservatives.,GL2U22,2025-05-05T17:42:39,4
These fraud Republicans have brass balls for the kind of pure Fox sound-bite bullshit garbage they spew in front of voters. Soon these greedy terrorist clowns won‚Äôt be able to appear in public at all.,Stinkstinkerton,2025-05-05T14:49:27,3

"The don't consider democrats ""their constituents"" to begin with.  They have made that clear.  With these town halls though, they also make it clear that dissent gets you lumped in with the out groups and you will be oppressed with the same vigor.  They do not consider themselves to be civil servants. They want to be your uncivil masters.",Za_Lords_Guard,2025-05-05T14:01:32,148
"Representatives go to Washington and get swept up into a project and they become a small cog in the money mechanism that keeps them in power. Their job becomes to stay in power, not serve the people. And if they don't, someone else willing to be that cog will replace them with monied interests backing them. It's institutional in nature, unfortunately. The amount of voter turnout is abysmal in this country. So nothing will change until that changes.",Dysc,2025-05-05T15:11:06,21

"In Kansas, Senator Roger Marshall keeps bringing up him getting fucking wrecked by people in Logan, Kansas.

I live in a very very red small town. The difference between now and the week after the election is palpable. It's like slowly the veil is lifting and people are figuring out they're gonna get screwed. Downside is they see liberal organizations and brown people getting screwed over more so they're mostly OK with it.¬†,Pando5280,2025-05-06T00:11:31,2
