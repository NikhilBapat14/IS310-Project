Here's the thing maga people. You will say we are objecting to this because we are some how against whites. That's not true. If these people are truly in danger I have no problem accepting them. But notice that Trump has slowed down and stopped refuges from  non white countries. He's also had people in refuge status deported with no real proof of them being criminals.  If you think this is truly about helping poor white South African's and not a virtue signal you are either naive or purposely being obtuse.,Fairymask,2025-05-09T19:57:53,36

As an American citizen who was born here, I demand that trump put America First. He shouldn't bring these refugees into my country, because they're taking my resources.
