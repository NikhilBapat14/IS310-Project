"""“I have no regrets, not a day has gone by that I thought it was the wrong decision. I was welcomed with open arms. I knew after reading Project 2025 that if Trump got in, it was time for me and my non-binary child to leave the country,” the A League of Their Own star said Tuesday.  “It’s been heartbreaking, I have to tell you,” O’Donnell continued before launching into a diatribe.  I knew that if i was in the United States and watched him destroy the country and the constitution and really pay no mind to any of the laws that the founders stood by and that our country stands for as a beacon of shining light and freedom for the rest of the world, that should he do what the Heritage Foundation said he was going to do in that Project 2025, that we were going to be in big trouble and it’s as bad as they promised and even a little bit worse and it’s been heartbreaking and personally very very sad to watch.""  .  https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/04/22/rosie-odonnell-tells-cnn-it-was-time-for-me-and-my-non-binary-child-to-leave-america-after-trumps-election/",Ironman650,2025-04-22T11:54:14,8

"Everything our nation is founded on is only of value to the left if it pushes their agenda. If it doesn't it should be repealed, destroyed or ignored.    O'Donnell is a shining example of this. She stood with the left the last four years with their push to ""rewrite"" the constitution, to ignore DOJ rulings and to abolish freedom unless you were one of the sacred races/genders. She stands for everything that our nation is not.    Thing is, she knows that, she knows she's full of shit, it's lip service to a legacy to keep people on their side. She doesn't for a second believe the shit she is spewing. The liberal elite have gone full circle and want a tyrannical dictatorship with themselves at the head of the table. Rank and file liberals are either caught in the loud drowning of the extremists or are too stupid to see the classic tactic being used to manipulate them into becoming tools.    But make no mistake, and this goes for both Republican's and Democrat's, those that are in power and the elite of this country do not care about you or me. They care about maintaining power. Trump is a disruptor, which is why he is good for the country right now, but the establishment politicans are a Uniparty, it is critical to never forget that.    The only purpose of Democrat and Republican for the uniparty establishment is to keep everyday American's divided over petty bullshit, so that we don't stand united to fight for prosperity to reach the majority of Americans.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-27T16:04:55,1
