"In order for Trump to have standing to request a special master, he must show the judge that the FBI’s search was improper.  Trump has said he can’t say if the search was improper until a special master is appointed.  Cannon has decided to appoint a special master for Trump, to help Trump possibly show the search was improper, giving Cannon the jurisdiction to appoint a special master.  It’s Möbius strip logic.  Normally to challenge a search *before a criminal trial* the impropriety must be facially obvious — like the search warrant listed someone else’s address.  Further, [44 U.S. Code § 2204 - Restrictions on access to Presidential records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/2204)  > The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have jurisdiction over any action initiated by the former President asserting that a determination made by the Archivist violates the former President’s rights or privileges.  Trump is challenging the Archives rights to the classified documents and presidential documents in his possession. He doesn’t want to challenge this in DC, because the courts there are less favorable, so he’s wrapping it into this civil action.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-09-21T13:45:38,4
"[Lawfareblog has an explanation that is too in-depth to copy and paste here.](https://www.lawfareblog.com/everything-wrong-judge-cannons-ruling) An attempt to summarise: the judge is granting Trump a kind of relief that is inapplicable. Normally, a court would step in when someone's rights in criminal procedure have been violated, but Trump has not yet been indicted. If there's no criminal process, there is no reason for the court to intervene. In other words, the relief came before the harm could possibly have taken place.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2022-09-21T19:12:01,3
"You need to provide some more information here. Do you have a link that shows where you're seeing this? I mean, she very obviously has jurisdiction because she's actually made rulings. That doesn't happen by accident.   It could be that people are anticipating her rulings are bad enough that they will be overturned on appeal, when it will be out of her hands. That makes sense. Or maybe they're talking about the Trump v. Clinton case that is a separate matter and only avoided Cannon's jurisdiction by good fortune?",mormagils,2022-09-20T08:23:25,2
"[""It’s just something that the judge has no jurisdiction over,” said Kerr, the criminal procedure expert, who called the issue a “really fundamental constitutional separation of powers point.”](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/09/06/doj-mar-a-lago-next-steps-00055086) it's the bottom of point 4.  And actually I've found it [spelled out](https://www.lawfareblog.com/everything-wrong-judge-cannons-ruling) a bit on this blog, but again I have no idea if that makes it true  Also thanks for answering",klone_free,2022-09-20T10:00:56,1
"Ok, I see now. Kerr--and basically the entire legal community--are making the point that Cannon's ruling is absolutely terrible and makes no sense at all given the established law. Essentially, they're arguing that any competent judge would not have authorized a special master because it would basically make the law incoherent if she did.  So it's not that she doesn't have the literal jurisdiction to make a ruling, but more that making this particular ruling is bonkers insane and can't possibly be the right answer. It'd be like saying rich people can't sue because they're probably doing fine anyway. Maybe that's not the best example, but I think you get the point.",mormagils,2022-09-20T10:17:02,3
"Ok, so even if another judge would overturn it after her (is there an appeal that happens for judgements like this?) It is legally binding and within her jurisdiction at the moment?",klone_free,2022-09-20T14:05:08,1
"There is an appeal in progress, actually, at the 11th Circuit Court. The DOJ appealed basically right after the ruling was made.  But until that appeal is ruled on, yes, the current ruling is binding. That's why a Special Master has been appointed and is currently do his job. The DOJ did make a motion that was essentially ""Judge Cannon, you made god awful ruling so at least put a stay on it for now until the appeals court weighs in"" and Cannon rejected that motion.",mormagils,2022-09-20T14:09:02,2
Ahhh it all makes much more sense now. Thanks for taking the time to explain that,klone_free,2022-09-20T15:14:04,1
