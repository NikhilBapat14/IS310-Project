"I thought it was totally normal, and not a scandal",sauced,2025-05-01T11:35:05,1
The administration narrative about this the next few days is going to be nothing but lies.  [https://open.substack.com/pub/bradleyroemer/p/breaking-news-trump-sacks-waltz](https://open.substack.com/pub/bradleyroemer/p/breaking-news-trump-sacks-waltz),ThoughtGuy79,2025-05-01T11:41:15,1

Trump is unable to fire people. They just get slowly shunned by the cult.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-01T11:59:54,1
Maybe they’re firing him in hope that everyone forgets about Signal.,Wuggers11,2025-05-01T11:34:23,2
"I think it’s because of the second signal scandal.  Waltz had nothing to do with it of course, but trump is determined to keep Hegseth on for some fucking reason, maybe because he’s afraid he can’t get another incompetent loyalist Sec of Defense past the Senate with his approval ratings tanking.",survivor2bmaybe,2025-05-01T12:15:19,1
"But isn’t that counter productive, as it’s not really being talked about much at this point but this story brings it back up?",Lontology,2025-05-01T11:37:04,1
I think they’re trying to pin all the blame on him when it was actually a group effort.,Wuggers11,2025-05-01T15:55:38,1
