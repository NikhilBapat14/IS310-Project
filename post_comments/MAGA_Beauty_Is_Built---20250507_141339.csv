"The rage content is literally the current foundation of the party. Just look at any of the comments. They just drop a controversial statement, argue a bit or not at all and disappear. It’s exactly what 4Chan was famous for, and it’s currently all over the Fox News comments section. I think unless dems can think of a way to counter that, they are at a major disadvantage. Problem is that it’s not possible to argue anything since they just disappear",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T14:22:18,7

"""MAGA Beauty""?   You mean botox, nose jobs, lip injections, and breast implants that is ironically a form of gender affirming care?   Take someone like Laura Loomer, look at a before and after picture and tell me she shouldn't have sued the plastic surgeons for malpractice ",blues111,2025-05-07T14:29:21,2
"Kristi Noem made around $130k as Governor and is now making around $250k in the Cabinet, certainly good salaries but not enough to explain why she has a watch worth $50k without being bribed.  If you account for taxes, that one watch costs more than half of her Governor salary for an entire year.",mmhannah,2025-05-07T14:31:27,2
"Kristi Noem, Nancy Mace and Karoline Leavitt did not invent either the aesthetic or the tactics they employ on social media, Jessica Grose writes in Times Opinion. “Their look is an extreme and specific version of a million other interchangeable influencers. As my newsroom colleague Sandra Garcia noted, ‘Lifestyle influencers exist in an ecosystem that prizes homogeneity,’ because social media algorithms reward it. These algorithms also reward rage baiting, or the deliberate posting of negative content in order to create more engagement and more clicks. Influencing has become a form of female power that is acceptable within conservative communities because it does not threaten the status quo, where women are ultimately subordinate and ornamental.“  Read the full piece [here, for free](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/07/opinion/maga-beauty-viral-women.html?unlocked_article_code=1.FU8.NH0y.PxHw27grDyW_&smid=re-nytopinion), even without a Times subscription.",nytopinion,2025-05-07T14:14:00,2

"Except now the opposing force has grown and our anger is about to reach a breaking point. The thing conservatives rely on is democrats low energy to push their agendas, but I don't think it even matters at this point who runs as democrat in any seat coming up in 2026.  Republicans will feel blue fire.  ",arilupe,2025-05-07T14:25:51,2

Right? Pelosi's father was a rich dude and she married a rich dude yet people are adamant that she is some sort of genius inside trader.  Two decades ago Noem was shooting innocent animals on some dusty farm and now she has enough free cash for a $50k watch? And no one seems to notice? Really?,Grandpa_No,2025-05-07T14:42:50,1
It's always funny looking at government portraits of female Republican politicians pre- and post-Trump. From church potluck moms to botoxed and spray-tanned trophy wives. Kristi Noem's transformation is particularly hilarious.,liebkartoffel,2025-05-07T14:36:40,8
"Well I’ve been looking through the comments, and I’m sure a lot of them are not even located in the US. They seem to be all over Facebook, Fox News, X, and there is no substance to anything they say. It’s a random “what about ___”, an insult to a group, or blind support. There isn’t anything that can change them since they don’t seem to care at all and may actually be doing this for a living (based on a couple pro Trump posts I saw and then they started arguing in hindi for no apparent reason about wages).   It may sound sad but democrats may need to employ similar tactics, inflammatory one-liners and bail. There is a large portion of our population that does not simply have the attention for anything more than a one-line quip. The other option is just playing people’s emotion, specifically anger about the opposing side, which has been shown to have a far greater impact on memories and opinions than promoting one’s own strengths, it’s easier and more effective to just point out people’s flaws",Agreeable_Crow789,2025-05-07T14:32:51,3
"In the first Trump administration, a lot of his top people resigned because the top salary was $180k at the time, apparently grifters can't live on that much.  They must be getting straight up under the table cash now, or maybe across the desk like Spiro Agnew.",mmhannah,2025-05-07T14:48:14,1
Or Laura Loomer.  She went from a relatively attractive woman to a mockery of femineity that appears pulled straight from a child's nightmare.,code_archeologist,2025-05-07T14:50:28,7
"Agreed they need to hit social platforms and media hard.  Get their message out and now.  This sitting around talking about shit in interviews is not working anymore.  Trump and his team used podcasts, influencers, ect.  Its time they do the same. ",arilupe,2025-05-07T14:36:13,1
