The optimist in me says maybe in the government's desperation to avoid discovery they'll work to get Abrego Garcia home in the next week.  The realist in me says that this is just another case of a federal judge being taken on a walk by the Trump administration based on nothing other than some vague sense of judicial deference that is destroying any semblance of the judiciary as a coequal branch.,Tank3875,2025-04-24T15:28:41,25
">U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Wednesday evening pausing expedited discovery in the case for seven days. The move came after the Trump administration, in a sealed motion earlier in the day, asked the judge for the pause.  >The judge's order said the pause was made with the agreement of both the government and attorneys representing Abrego Garcia.",Choice_Reindeer7759,2025-04-24T15:29:24,10
It’s always another delay. I don’t see how there are enough lawyers to fight all of Donald Trump’s court cases.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-24T15:32:06,5

"Well, now he's completely disappeared. Not in Cecot and the government won't say which prison he's in now. His family, our congressmen, and his lawyers have no contact and no idea where he is.    I don't understand why it's okay with Judge Xinis to give these Trump DOJ liars another week. Every hour matters. It appears she does not want to fight with the Trump administration. Which is very, very sad.",FIlm2024,2025-04-25T01:44:40,1
"I just discovered this photo of him with MS 13 iconography on his knuckles. Why isn’t the media reporting more on this? Doesn’t excuse the Trump administration for violating his withhold from removal status but I feel like the media is reluctant to fully report on the full context of his time in America, beginning with his 2019 arrest which led to his deportation proceedings and his ultimate withhold from removal ruling.

">The judge's order said the pause was made with the agreement of both the government and attorneys representing Abrego Garcia.  At least his lawyers think it's the right way forward.

That is one crappy photo.,Amazing_Ad_6045,2025-04-24T19:21:11,5
"Those photos have been going around for maybe a week or two. It's not particularly relevant at the moment. The media's been reporting it but you also have to remember that among the trade war, intelligence leaks, and 500 other things happening every day, there's only so much room in the media hopper for complex immigration stories.  More importantly, the question right now in the courts and under the prior SCOTUS decision has nothing to do with whether he's associated with MS13. Any consideration of his alleged association is out scope of the current SCOTUS decision related to this case. The standing issue is that he's been deprived of due process and should be returned to receive due process for any accusations against him, as anyone and everyone protected under our constitution and under our immigration laws should receive, both noncitizens and citizens alike.  I would also add that if he is so unequivocally connected to MS13 as is alleged, the gov't should've been able to produce clear cut evidence to that effect long before we got this far and trying to interpret someone's tattoos is far from any kind of real evidence. They failed to do that on multiple occasions over several weeks in front of the courts and out of nowhere released photos of his tattoos in social media -- photos that had not been presented in court. Every indication is that their accusations against Abrego Garcia are flimsy at best.  But again, that's not relevant right now or even up for debate in the courts. The court orders are specifically focused on making sure he receives due process. If, in that due process, he is found to be guilty of something, then so be it. But he is protected under our constitution to receive that due process.",Boomshtick414,2025-04-24T21:11:39,3
There were pictures of him last week and he met with a senator. They probably haven’t killed him since not with the attention,Lantis28,2025-04-24T15:30:05,13
"I thinke Judge Xinis has to uphold due process for Trump, and denying the stay would open the door to disrupt the entire process via appeals and attacks on Xinis's credibility.    In my opinion It's a smart move to approve the stay and when they fail to provide any evidence that they're working on it, it will bolster the case in favor of holding Trump in contempt.   I wouldn't read too much into this move as far as progress to free Kilmar goes.",Choice_Reindeer7759,2025-04-24T16:20:14,2

"Not according to his immigration hearings from 2019… two judges from the immigration courts found him to be a likely gang member. They ultimately denied his seeking asylum and only gave him withhold from removal status (which provides no path to permanent legal residence). That’s the point I guess I’m making I don’t see how anyone can objectively think this guy wasn’t a gang member given the circumstances of his 2019 run in with law-enforcement.  But no doubt that DHS unlawfully deported him given his withhold from removal status. People seem to be turning a blind eye to the obvious evidence of his ties to MS 13, [https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1396906/dl?inline](https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1396906/dl?inline) in my opinion.",Mak10Linn,2025-04-24T21:18:31,-1
Why do you think those are MS-13 tattoos? Could you prove it in court?,Choice_Reindeer7759,2025-04-24T21:37:09,6
"Better, thanks. Much as the White House is claiming that those tattoos translate to MS13, at least some experts disagree with that claim:  Marijuana leaves, crosses and skulls are widely used as tattoos by people who do not belong to gangs. Gang crime experts said they did not stand out to them as MS-13 markers.  ""I don’t believe a ‘dangerous individual’ would have such anodyne and farcically generic tattoos on his hand,"" said Liliana Castañeda Rossmann, a California State University San Marcos emerita professor of communication and author of the book ""Transcending Gangs: Latinas Story Their Experience.""  Sean Kennedy, a former federal public defender in California and now a Loyola Law School professor, said that in his experience representing and interacting with current and former MS-13 members, ""The tattoos in the photo don't look familiar to me.""  In fact, Kennedy said, such designs are out of character with typical MS-13 tattoos.  ""Within MS-13 culture, such markings would likely be frowned upon and even viewed as a sign of cowardice, as they could be interpreted as an attempt to hide or downplay gang affiliation,"" Kennedy said. ""That type of concealment goes against the gang's norms, which often demand bold, visible demonstrations of identity and loyalty.""  Charles Katz, director of Arizona State University’s Center for Violence Prevention and Community Safety, concurred.  While Katz said that local law enforcement would be more familiar with specific tattoo designs in a given region, ""I have worked on issues related to MS-13 for the past 15 years in El Salvador and the U.S. and I have never seen tattoos or graffiti suggesting that these particular tattoos are associated with MS-13"".

"Maybe he is, maybe he isn't. That's not material right now. The reality is lots of folks get accused of stuff they didn't do and that's why due process exists.  The core question right now is if anyone can be deprived of due process so long as the gov't can stick them on plane out of the country fast enough and throw them in a hole somewhere on foreign soil. I would hope 99% of Americans of understand the importance of protecting that constitutional right lest they be next.",Boomshtick414,2025-04-24T21:24:25,6
"Ha! Ok man. Those are the exact symbols associated with MS 13, that combined with him being taken into custody in 2019 with three other known MS 13 members… yea doth protest too much methinks",Mak10Linn,2025-04-24T19:37:23,-6
"I agree with that, he should have been brought back to immigration courts for another hearing to evaluate whether it was now safe for him to be returned to his home country. withhold from removal only says we can’t return someone because he’ll get killed. They didn’t award him asylum, even in his second round of appeals so pretty stupid for the Trump administration not to have given him that due process since it seems like a slam dunk for deportation",Mak10Linn,2025-04-24T21:27:03,0
