The tax cut doesn‚Äôt even apply to like 90% of Americans. We end up with a fucking tax hike to go along with the other tax hikes the dumbass Republicans have foisted on us.,Ancient_Popcorn,2025-05-07T13:56:30,16
"A trap they set for themselves, stepped directly into, and could step out of any time they wanted. Just pass a bill setting tariffs back to what they were at the beginning of the year and taking away Trump's ability to fuck with them. Dems would vote for it so it can pass without the entire GOP needing to be on board. It would not be hard.   But they don't dare disappoint Daddy.",pervocracy,2025-05-07T14:04:12,13
"Brendan Buck, a communications strategist who has worked for Paul Ryan and John Boehner, writes in a guest essay for Times Opinion:  >After more than 100 days of President Trump marked by overreach and economic self-immolation, congressional Republicans need a reset to save their political fortunes. Representative Mike Johnson, the House speaker, is banking on a spending and tax cut package to provide that jolt, and numerous House committees are now working quickly to stitch together a bill he has pledged to deliver to Mr. Trump before Independence Day.  >This ‚Äúone big, beautiful bill,‚Äù as Mr. Trump has called it, contains most of the president‚Äôs legislative agenda. Indeed, the strategy is making the bill too big to fail, betting that wavering members will not be willing to vote against it and deliver the leader of their own party such a stinging defeat.  >But what if it does pass and voters barely take notice?

It's not a trap when you set it for yourself and you know it's coming.,_aaine_,2025-05-07T16:58:11,1
"""But the reality is it‚Äôs no cut at all for most people. The rates they are preserving have been in place for more than seven years now.""  Right, these taxes have been in place for 7 years, so passing this bill isn't going to give anybody any relief. Instead, we'll be left feeling the pain of higher prices, lower medicaid benefits, etc. Those are primarily issues felt by the poorest, and GUESS WHO THEY VOTED FOR.  ""Passing a bill to prevent tax rates from going up is a necessary action. But congressional leaders should not kid themselves. Unless they ‚Äî or the markets ‚Äî can convince the president to back down on tariffs, this ‚Äúone big, beautiful bill‚Äù may feel more like thin gruel to voters.""  Right, tariffs are going to absolutely get them destroyed in the midterms. These guys are letting Trump do them and they're basically building their own political coffins here. Everyone's top issue come midterms is going to be tariffs.",Orzorn,2025-05-07T14:28:20,0
