"So law enforcement and health officials know who this guy is but he's still ""unidentified""? Sounds like this guy might be politically inconvenient.",dom650,2025-04-27T14:36:54,24
Inquisitive minds ask:  is he a follower of the Religion of Peace (TM)?,Ask4MD,2025-04-27T15:37:25,20
Just saw video of him he is phillipino.  Our system here is broken. This guy's was well known to the provincial gov and the cops never recieved any help or sanction for having mental health issues was allowed to run free.   If the liberals stay in he will be walking free in less than a year. If this was done in the Phillipines I believe you all know what would have happened to him once the SUV came to a stop. And it would have been stopped via multiple perforations by phillipino security or military services.    Fucking sad that the country I was born in and live in has become this crime ridden drug infested liberal cesspool.   Can't wait for the down votes and the Reddit messages that Reddit cares and perhaps another account ban because I am spewing hate or threatening violence by posting this. But when you hear that a 2 year old child was one of the victims you have to say something.,FormerBTfan,2025-04-27T19:06:00,15
