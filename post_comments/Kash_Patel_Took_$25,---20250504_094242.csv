The Proud Boys are good, and Antifa is bad. That judgement exists independent of behavior. It's why they seem to be okay twisting themselves up in knots to defend Cheeto Benito.

"The Repubes fear Trump more than they fear their constituents and being pushed out of office. Until the Repubes fear their constituents will eject them from office, they will continue to support everything Trump does. I think things are starting to swing, but the Repube response was to stick their fingers in their ears and go ""na na na na na... I'm not listening"" by stopping holding town halls. That said, they ARE starting to get it. It will get worse this summer when store shelves are empty and prices are through the roof. Look at cargo traffic from China... down 35% to 40%, and that's before the Embargo level tariffs were put on. It takes 20 to 40 days for cargo to come across to US West Coast ports. Longer to US East Coast. Stuff coming in now is still pre-Liberation Day tariffs. The 145% and 245% stuff doesn't hit until later in May and June. It then takes a couple weeks to move to warehouses and then to retailers. July is going to be FUGLY. That's already baked in... even if Trump were to retreat on all tariffs today. Repubes are going to have a nasty, hot, angry summer from their constituents. Maybe then they'll start to change, because the 2026 election is already underway... they just don't know it yet. Dems are in for the same... they're just going to get hit for doing noting but sitting on their thumbs while the country burns.",Lookingfor68,2025-05-04T14:06:55,1
