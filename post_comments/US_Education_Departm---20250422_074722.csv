"I had loans forgiven during the Biden Administration.   They reappeared despite coming off my credit report and completely disappearing for 2 years - they totally reset my account to bring them back, it had my student email, my student cell number, student address - it was like I had never logged in the last 15 years, nobody Inspoke with could understand it either.   I'm transferring my car into my Father's name - it's my only asset.  I will never pay a dime on these loans.  I refuse to file taxes even tho they owe me money, bc it will just get siezed for these.  I will now only work as an independent contractor - so there is no ability to garnish my wages. I don't have a bank account. I will never, ever borrow money, so I don't give a shit about credit.  Lets fucking go!   This, more than anything he has done so far, is dangerous.",jakktrent,2025-04-22T08:59:20,10
"The Article:  # US Education Department to resume collecting student loans in default  April 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education said on Monday it will resume collecting federal student repayments from borrowers in default from May 5 after a pause of more than five years.The resumption will impact more than 5 million borrowers who are in default, the Education Department said in a statement, adding that another 4 million borrowers were late in making payments.  Student loan collections were paused in 2020 as a way to provide relief during economic uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.All borrowers in default will receive email communications from the Education Department's Office of Federal Student Aid over the next two weeks, the department said. It will begin sending notices later this summer to start wage garnishment for those in default.""American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,"" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.The administration of Democratic former President Joe Biden often made attempts at providing student debt relief, which met with criticism by Republicans, including President Donald Trump.Biden's student loan forgiveness policies also faced setbacks from the courts during his term.Student Borrower Protection Center, which litigates on behalf of student borrowers and advocates for policy in Washington, condemned the Trump administration's new announcement.""The announcement also comes as Americans are navigating unprecedented economic uncertainty,"" the advocacy group said, citing rising costs and the economic fallout of recent government firings.",social_gamer,2025-04-22T08:01:22,3
"I love this country, the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and millions of people might have to default on their student loan debt thanks to this. Screw this administration and Linda McMahon. I’m surprised they haven’t fully abolished the DOE yet.",RoughWestern9152,2025-04-22T07:56:20,7

"Student loans and the cost of post-secondary education are both problematic, but I’m not sure why this is unexpected.   Repayment resumed in October 2023. If there’s no forbearance or deferment, default occurs after 9 months of non-payment. Wage garnishment, collections, and negative credit reporting all occurred before COVID.",Rich_Charity_3160,2025-04-22T08:38:17,4

"As a german theres one thing I dont understand and maybe you can help me: in the US you have to pay for your college or university stuff because it is NOT financed by the taxes. Here in europe nobody can escape his taxes so its not really ""free"" but rather you will pay your whole life with higher taxes.   So when it comes back to paying back the student loans, why is it considered bad while on the other have you also never have to pay as high taxes as we do?",Kooky_Arm_6831,2025-04-23T00:49:46,1

"They feed each other. People borrow money to go to college. They can borrow a little or a lot. Colleges see this and increase prices. Because the money is borrowed anymore, people just borrow more to go. Colleges can nor raise prices every year because they are able to get people to come no matter when the price is.",ACSportsbooks,2025-04-22T08:41:34,1
