"> Except I don't think a trial is required just to deport people to their home country who do not have legal status.  You're right, but they are entitled to due process, and that's all that most people are arguing for. Obama, who was known as ""the deporter-in-chief"" because he deported more undocumented people than any other president, gave all those folks due process. It didn't keep him from earning the record. This administration is simply hostile to the rule of law.",appmanga,2025-04-21T19:56:04,2

They're flipping the script, basically. Remember a few years back when those ""learn to code"" memes were hot? Now they want to throw the coders into the mines, and I'm not talking about Bitcoin mines. One MAGA influencer was saying, ""Men don't need therapy. Men need MAGA and tariffs.
