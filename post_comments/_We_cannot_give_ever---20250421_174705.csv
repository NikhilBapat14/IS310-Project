I know this is a ridiculous argument but why don’t they just go to a country that’s a lot more homogenously white? I’m sure there’s plenty in Europe why are they destroying America with this extremely unpopular and dangerously stupid goal of theirs,cloudkite17,2025-04-21T19:29:45,14

"Being than”melting pot” was always the best part of America.  We were all colors and ethnicities together in a big pot of soup.

"I’m honestly floored at how extreme and cruel the Republican Party is now after growing up in Obama’s America. I thought we would, as a majority, continue pushing society towards progress and embracing diversity and accessibility. I remember laughing about how silly it was for Fox News to be so obsessed with being anti-“Happy Holidays” and thinking no one could ever take them seriously.

"Scott Bessent told Tucker Carlson about possibly using all the fired federal employees and civil servants to fill American factory roles. There's this MAGA-branded version of Maoism, remixed for the algorithm age, currently spreading through the populist right, where the conversation isn't just about jobs coming back to America, but what kind of jobs should count as ""real jobs"". They're flipping the script, basically. Remember a few years back when those ""learn to code"" memes were hot? Now they want to throw the coders into the mines, and I'm not talking about Bitcoin mines. One MAGA influencer was saying, ""Men don't need therapy. Men need MAGA and tariffs. All those ""fake email jobs"" will disappear.""",AutistoMephisto,2025-04-22T11:23:45,5
