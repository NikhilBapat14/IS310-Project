Does flip mean convincing a few republican representatives now or waiting two years for a vote ,StoneCypher,2025-04-25T14:45:23,1484

"As far as flipping the house, I hope I am wrong, but I think the average American doesn't understand our civics system well enough to realize that with a few key changes during midterms, congress will be able to cock block Trump for the rest of his term and put an end to this donkey show.  A lot of people think they are helpless and just have to sit back and watch. Others are just lazy bums who love to complain after the fact even though they didn't vote.",Bruce-7891,2025-04-25T14:45:49,2129
"Two years from now, and if Congress flips to Democrats, getting a conviction in the Senate would still be unlikely. It depends on what further crimes he commits in the next 20 months or so.",MKEJOE52,2025-04-25T14:49:25,215

"Trump has implemented mass deportation of ""illegal"" immigrants.  Many of these people have been summarily sent to foreign prisons without a chance to plead their case in court, ignoring due process and the rule of law.  And, the courts are unable to do anything, because Trump simply ignores court rulings saying he can't do that.  In fact, Trump has started arresting judges who interfere when ICE agents try to snatch up immigrants who show up for the court hearings that are allowed.  Trump has appointed Elon Musk, a foreign national, the head of a new government agency, DOGE, and allowed Musk and DOGE to walk into government agencies, fire all their employees, and take control of the money that had been previously used to fund said agencies.  All without Congress confirming the creation of DOGE or formally confirming Elon Musk as the head of any government agency whatsoever.  Trump has started a trade war with virtually every other country in the world, all in an attempt to feed his ego and manipulate world stock markets to the financial advantage of himself and his billionaire buddies.  In the process, Trump has blown up every single alliance the USA has and ensured that the US dollar is no longer the bedrock of the world financial system.  Every judge and every member of Congress needs to wake up and realize that the US Constitution, the concept of the rule of law, and American democracy itself are no longer in effect in the USA, and have not been in effect since Trump was sworn in for his second term.  Unless the courts and Congress act now, there aren't going to be midterm elections in 2026, and certainly no federal elections in 2028.",KimmyT1436,2025-04-25T16:33:48,16

"Americans are now living in the Fourth Reich.  When the government overrides the constitution and the law, depots people without due process, arrests members of the judiciary for disagreeing with their policies, manipulates the stock market for personal gain and tries to fire the head of the Federal Reserve for not submitting to their economic policy, believes in freedom and freedom of speech but only for the privileged few and subverts religion for their own ends.

"Here's a thought - I know it's a stupid one, but...  If the whole of the Congress believed & upheld the rule of law then it wouldn't be an issue, but just over half don't for whatever reason.  How about some private investigators to look at the dealings of some of the R house members, it shouldn't be too hard to find some suitable kompromat, surely? There are surely some members who are on shaky ground electorally, with slim majorities & in this climate they would probably be out next time someone gets to vote...  If Vlad has the kompromat & therefore the tangerine twat also has, then how difficult can it be?  Thats surely the key to getting a suitable number of votes...  It worked for Starr...but cos Bill Clinton was actually relatively clean, it took a while. Shouldn't take that long for this bunch of reprobates.  We know they're being threatened with a ""primary"" if they don't hold the line, but if they have nothing to lose either way then maybe...maybe half a dozen reps & a few more senators...

"I’m a progressive liberal and I am against this. Let Trump deal with his wound, don’t help him lick it. We should be less concerned about Trump’s third impeachment. He already has two to his name, no one is competing with him on that. No one plays the victim card like Trump, and he binges on people’s emotions and sympathy to gain the trust and admiration of others. I’m not sure there’s anyone in America who thought Trump was going to win a library board election after January 6th. Fast forward to when the  search of his home, which he labelled “raids”, and charges started dropping, he used that to his advantage.  What Democrats need is taking back Congress putting a check on the Toddler/Felon-in-Chief and stopping Trump and his administration from taking away the rights and social safety nets of Americans, especially healthcare. Doing this will improve the quality of life for Americans and American businesses. When there’s price stability and people can afford healthcare and necessities, life is good! People will remember who is responsible for that. Democrats need to expand their base that we are currently bleeding out.  Don’t be fooled, these Republicans and Independents who voted for Trump are only mad and regretting that Trump policies hurts everybody and that Trump didn’t make them (Trump supporters) an exception. They are Trump sympathizers. They love Trump and are only this way because they got burned too by Trump and Elon’s policies; they expected MAGAt to be exempted from the job firings, social security cuts and so on, but they were dead wrong.

The average person just hears that Biden has a Dem-led Congress and then doesn't get why he couldn't just get everything through immediately.  The media didn't help here either. I still remember watching Bakari Sellers and others get on TV and criticize Democrats and say stuff along the lines of, ""The people gave you majorities, why aren't you making changes? So they go to the ballot box, not knowing why they should vote for them again.""  They could've explained the problem, but they didn't because ""that's not the media's role.""",joshdoereddit,2025-04-25T16:33:31,2

And then vote your conscience in your general election - you can vote for whatever party you want at that point (although you should think about the numbers and where your vote may be most strategically allocated…)  Communicating this to the general public is complicated, but if enough people work at it, we can raise the numbers of people participating in primaries and make a difference.

The Democrats are realistically playing defense going into the midterms for the Senate.

"A bit of a story for one Senator on this list, Bill Hagerty.   My wife and I moved to Tennessee in 2016. Flash forward a few years, and we're both working in a local restaurant here, she as a server and myself in the back of house.   Hagerty comes in with his two sons on their way to a Scouting event. He was campaigning for his current Senate seat.   My wife, out there as a server and very friendly, found out they were on their way to this Scout event and mentioned that I was a Boy Scout in my youth. Hagerty asks to meet me.   So I go out,  not knowing the man or anything about him, and talk him briefly. We talk about scouting, and I mention I was a poli sci major (among several assorted majors I switched at a whim in college.) At any rate, he was the Amabassador to Japan at one point and he gave me a challenge coin, which I still have somewhere. He then asked me for his vote.   At this point his kids got very uncomfortable,  and I replied something to the effect of ""Well sir, I will certainly look at your platform and consider it. "" however I worded it, he wasn't wild about my response, his kids seemed embarrassed, and they left. I did indeed look at his platform and I voted against him.   Listen, long story short, I dig the coin but the guy seemed like, and is clearly after six years, a bastard.

They were the carving up of the United States into political entities.  One of the best solutions to fix US politics would be to reform the Senate so it would be made up of equally sized voting districts that ignored state lines.   And the power of states being marginalized is not some wacko new idea. Many of the original founders strongly opposed giving states equal powers as it was too close to creating an aristocracy.   *But as States are a collection of individual men which ought we to respect most, the rights of the people composing them, or of the artificial beings resulting from the composition. Nothing could be more preposterous or absurd than to sacrifice the former to the latter. It has been said that if the smaller States renounce their equality, they renounce at the same time their liberty. The truth is it is a contest for power, not for liberty.* **-- Alexander Hamilton arguing in favor of a proportional Senate in the Madison Debates Friday June 29, 1787**  *He enumerated the objections against an equality of votes in the second branch, notwithstanding the proportional representation in the first. 1. the minority could negative the will of the majority of the people. 2. they could extort measures by making them a condition of their assent to other necessary measures. 3. they could obtrude measures on the majority by virtue of the peculiar powers which would be vested in the Senate. 4. the evil instead of being cured by time, would increase with every new State that should be admitted, as they must all be admitted on the principle of equality. 5. the perpetuity it would give to the preponderance of the Northern against the Southern.
