"The neo-isolationist right just doesn't seem to understand how interdependent the modern world is. The ironic thing is that the right cheered on the entire movement to offshore manufacturing. They sold us out and want everyone else to take the blame. That said, if this were a game and was actually gonna happen, I'd much rather play as China than the US. They are much better situated to win.  (Amazingly, it wasn't long ago that enlightened people understood that an interdependent world could be a great win for EVERYBODY. Too bad small and greedy minds rule the world.)",barneyrubbble,2025-04-22T10:16:23,8
