"Leverage is financial speak for borrowing to make investments or purchase businesses ( e.g. leveraged buyout )  and has crept into MAGA language to mean something else entirely.   What they think it means is unclear to me. It is their magical word used to describe Trump in terms which imply that he is a master negotiator when this could not be further from the truth.  Lying, cheating , flip flops and contradictory statements destroy confidence and trust.

"Not that you deserve it with your willful avoidance and verbose responses containing zero substance, but here’s an example for both:  Finance: when your assets aren’t compelling enough to lift the target about the “fulcrum”, you can add debt or LEVERAGE  Bessent: When outright demands aren’t compelling enough to gain the terms or concessions you want from your target country, you can add threats or punishments, once again denoting LEVERAGE.  I can’t imagine what your “professional experience negotiating” would involve if it’s inherently devoid of the understanding of such a simple concept. More likely, it serves as its backbone and you’re just in a spot where you’d rather quadruple down on willful ignorance than take the slight hit to your ego involved with admitting that your first comment was misguided.",Gringo_Loco,2025-04-28T05:37:50,2
"You used “eg: leveraged buyout”, after already saying “financial speak”, “investments”, “purchase business”",AureliasTenant,2025-04-28T11:21:11,1
China has way more control over its economy than Donald does. He can use tariff that’s about it. All done via a self created “emergency” using executive orders.   By decreasing the Yuan value China is now a much more attractive place to buy from for all the countries that are not the USA. This also makes imported goods more expensive in the local Chinese market and more people likely to opt for locally produced goods. Both of these increase demand for goods to be produced.,Sinocatk,2025-04-28T01:36:19,4
What are you talking about?,ColeBeasleyMD,2025-04-28T01:06:52,2
Threats and punishment do not 'leverage' anything but are made in an attempt to pressure and intimidate.   You do not understand these concepts either.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T06:25:53,0

"Yes, they do.  Literally anything, tangible or not, that can be used to move them from their current stance to the one you want would be considered leverage. Ethics or norms are not of concern here.  Ability to threaten tariffs? Leverage. Threatening to expose misdeeds of their foreign leader? Leverage.  Please look up the noun, not the verb, and help me believe you aren’t actually this dense..",Gringo_Loco,2025-04-28T06:32:12,2
"They don’t understand because they live very narrow lives. Only when their own lives are adversely affected do they care, and rather than look at what caused those issues, it’s blame someone else. They can’t admit they were wrong.   Sadly things will have to get quite a lot worse before they come to their senses, luckily they have elected just the man to make that happen.",Sinocatk,2025-04-28T02:20:04,3
"I understand and have practised the mechanics of pressure politics and leverage is not the correct term for these actions.  You are using an imprecise term incorrectly and widely to encompass threatening behaviour.  It does not lever anything if there is no corresponding effect. Trump has launched tariffs against China and hurled abuse and lies. What has been the result?  Nothing has moved and China will sit tight. Do not fall into the trap of their weasel words, of which leverage is but one of many to float around this chaotic shitshow.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T06:54:54,0
"That’s just not true.  Just because there isn’t a corresponding action doesn’t make it “not leverage”.  If someone has dirt on a politician and pressures them to do something under threat of exposing it, that dirt is effectively leverage. The politician may choose to stand their ground and weather the consequences of it being exposed, but it doesn’t change the nature of the dirt or its influence. In that case, it may have been insufficient to get the result you wanted, but that doesn’t mean it’s a neutral factor and didn’t serve as leverage.  There are books, TV shows, movies, all having names using this term as it is used above.  You are bending yourself into knots to find any way for it not to work and I’m not really sure why when the definition and usage examples are freely available.",Gringo_Loco,2025-04-28T07:41:57,2
"Context is crucial in this instance.   Trump could well have used the threats of tariffs in the context of a trade negotiation as 'leverage' , for want of a better word , as a negotiating tool to exert pressure.  Instead he launched tariffs with the moronic expectation that China would come to him begging for their removal and that he would force 'a deal ' on it.  He has shot his load and has nothing else. China is sitting tight and his action has not 'leveraged' anything. He does not have any threats left and has failed dismally.  This is why Bessant is desperately trying to give the impression that Trump is 'leveraging' and practising 'strategic uncertainty '  , whatever the fuck that is.  This is him trying to create an impression that Trump is in control.  Do you at least take my point on this or are you hung up on weasel word semantics?",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T08:05:41,0
"I do hear your point about the larger picture, but it’s ironic you’re accusing me and others of semantics when you were the one who originally made such a point to hinge your argument specifically on a singular definition for the word, namely at the exclusion of its other more common usage.  I want to reiterate my point about the word’s independence from outcome before mentioning this, but just because China hasn’t flinched yet, doesn’t mean these moves don’t still serve as leverage. Tariffs have delayed effects, and as time passes, debt payments come due on manufacturing facilities in China, jobs get cut as management pivots to the accepting the new status quo, etc. Both sides know these things have lagging effects, and just because China has made the calculation that it is willing to suffer those costs than to publicly fall in line with Trump’s playground bully extortion tactics doesn’t mean that these tools aren’t leverage and that Trump’s team isn’t actively “leveraging” and considering other means of doing so.  It’s still a wildly stupid strategy and will hurt us more than them in the long run, but that’s a separate conversation entirely. No context is needed about the outcome to understand that these tariffs are being correctly described as leverage or tools of leverage. I’m done arguing this.",Gringo_Loco,2025-04-28T08:36:08,2
You have used leverage in a context which has never arisen in my 20 years of high level negotiations. Your examples appear to be drawn from popular culture and not the real world. Perhaps it is an issue arising out of our different dialects? In any case we must agree to disagree.,iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-04-28T09:04:28,1
