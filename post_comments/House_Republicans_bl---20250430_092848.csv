"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top.

"I was actually also curious about this.   The whole point of Signal (for regular people) is that everything is end-to-end encrypted and I would really rather not villify a product that was originally developed by the guy who sold WhatsApp to Meta and then said ""I'm going to build my own better private messenger... With blackjack!"" and took the funds from that sale and started the not-for-profit Signal Foundation to keep communications private, secure, and accessible for everyone in the face of authoritarian regimes. Signal's entire source code is open source for security audits and they frequently update their apps to patch new security holes. Honestly, one of very few sustainably (and imo, ethically) developed consumer-focused information privacy and security apps available.   I want to be very clear: I don't work for Signal, and I'm not trying to minimize what's happened. Just that an app for resisting authoritarian regimes seems like a bad thing to alienate during an authoritarian regime... Furthermore, Hegseth should be held accountable, but based on my background in IT and knowledge of Information Security, Signal (the app/service) is not the problem. **Hegseth's use of Signal to flout Oversight as well as Government Information Security & Data Retention Standards  is.**  But someone feel free to correct me with a source if I'm wrong at any point. *Edited slightly for clarity.",dethwysh,2025-04-30T14:45:03,31
