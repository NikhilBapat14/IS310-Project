"Socialism doesn't even mean socialism anymore in America. Has very little to do with economics, so leftists don't object to stuff like this.  You can be a socialist and not get kicked out of socialist spaces for supporting capitalist policies. However, you will be immediately excommunicated for rejecting mass migration or affirmative action or gender ideology. Therefore, that is what socialism is.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-17T12:57:16,4

Communism leads to a society more stratified than the feudal states that came before.  It's why China liberalized their economy into something that more closely resembles the economies of the fascist states.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-17T17:48:29,8
