"Can you point out specific districts that have reported presidential votes but not House votes? I haven't seen that.  Otherwise, I think you might just be misunderstanding the process. That the presidential race has been *called* doesn't mean they've finished counting all the votes. For example, California can be safely called for Democrats in the presidential election on election night, well before the votes have finished counting, based on exit polling and their usual margins. But there are lots of House districts in California that are close, so we have to count all the votes before we make final calls in those races. That doesn't mean the presidential votes have been counted but the House ones haven't.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-12T13:37:08,2
"The deadline to submit ballots in California is one week after election day. After that (today), the remaining mail-in and overseas ballots can be counted (and recounted, as needed )",DidjaSeeItKid,2024-11-13T00:26:30,2
"To add to this, when a state can count votes, and what the deadline is to receive mailed-in ballots, and to cure votes, is different in each state. Plus, some states have a higher percentage of ballots cast via mail.  Let's take California as an example, since 9 house races are still waiting to be called there. CA has until December 5th to certify election results and voters have until December 3rd to cure votes. San Diego County has roughly 140k votes still to count, compared to the 1,362,232 [source](https://www.livevoterturnout.com/ENR/sandiegocaenr/20/en/Index_20.html) ballots already counted. Of those, ~95k were received on or before election day, which 43k are condition (signature doesn't match, requiring a voter to ""cure"" the ballot. ""For mail ballot envelopes returned with a missing or non-matching signature, voters are mailed a letter and given the opportunity to verify and provide their signature so their ballot can be counted. Once “cured” the ballot can be removed from the envelope and processed into the count. Voters have until December 1 to cure these situations."")  As well, California accepts ballots received up until November 12th, as long as they were postmarked by election day.  Additionally, I *believe* that CA can't start counting ballots until after the polls close on election day. Some states count ballots as they come in, releasing those results as soon as the polls close.",Darkfriend337,2024-11-11T22:37:33,1
