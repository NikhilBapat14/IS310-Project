Good. He‚Äôs awesome,Kind-City-2173,2025-05-08T14:12:31,28

"If he can win in Kentucky as governor, he could win the state as President which would change the entire calculus.  I also believe its possible a Democrat would win a senate seat running at the same time.",Raspberries-Are-Evil,2025-05-08T16:02:50,17
"Thats my governor! He's fucking awesome, I remember his last election the gop literally had nothing on him so they tried to lie about him supporting some kinda trans surgeries or something and he smartly put out an ad saying it was bullshit and pretty much killed the entire narrative and easily won re election",FickleSystem,2025-05-08T16:17:43,14
"I like the idea of Beshear running. I'd vote for him in the primary, unless someone else really amazes me.",Torracattos,2025-05-08T14:19:33,19
Idk anything about him ik he‚Äôs gov in a strong red state. but whoever is the nominee he or she needs to have charisma,SquidwardIsTired,2025-05-08T16:21:37,6
He would have my vote in a heartbeat. 100%,Dsarg_92,2025-05-08T14:46:49,14
"He‚Äôs one I really want to see in the primaries.   He seems like an amazing guy, smart, talented‚Ä¶ but boring AF. Please don‚Äôt come for me! I think he‚Äôd make a great VP to a firecracker president.  But I personally believe we will need a spitfire candidate who isn‚Äôt afraid to speak their mind, because you can‚Äôt fight MAGA with thoughts and prayers. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Ok-Stress-3570,2025-05-08T22:34:20,5

"He‚Äôd be an amazing choice! He‚Äôs already proven that he can beat republicans in their own territory by becoming a governor of a deep red state. Hell, this may even make Kentucky a seriously competitive state during the election. I‚Äôd love to see him run :>",CactusSpirit78,2025-05-08T19:53:26,3

Him or Mark Kelly would be great choices.,Seal69dds,2025-05-08T20:08:23,3
"He was on Jon Stewart's Weekly Podcast last week. I really enjoyed the interview; he started off kinda poli-speaking and was a little stiff. But after about 20 minutes with Jon, Andy loosened up a bit and seemed a bit more candid. I recommend giving the episode a listen",Slyrunner,2025-05-09T06:15:52,3
I love him but IMO he has a long way to go before he would have the national presence needed to be a serious candidate. I also have doubts about a deep southerner‚Äôs ability to appeal to all the states (as a southerner myself). But I do support him getting started and hope he can pull it off.,Freebird_1957,2025-05-08T16:37:43,5
"He‚Äôs gonna run and he‚Äôs gonna win. The DNC has basically hand-selected him as far as I understand it, much like they did Obama",actualgarbag3,2025-05-08T14:21:27,9
I‚Äôll be happy if there are even primaries in 2018.,DavidG-LA,2025-05-09T03:07:48,2
Let him compete in an open primary and let the best candidate rise to the top. Last thing we need is another anointed candidate we have to fall in line behind,lostpilot,2025-05-09T03:08:28,1

Newsom is the very definition of ‚ÄúSmug Californian Stereotype‚Äù‚Ä¶.,Grand_Recipe_9072,2025-05-08T16:00:17,14
Nobody wants Newsom except Pelosi,MaskedRaider89,2025-05-08T17:40:02,10
"I actually like Newsom, hes absolutely one of the best talkers dems have hed destroy any republican in a debate and does well on right wing media, but the Republicans have already got it in ppls heads that hes some boogeyman that's destroyed California(he hasn't)and would make America like California so that and the fact that they'd hammer him on the fires means he'd have a giant hill to climb",FickleSystem,2025-05-09T17:24:35,2

"I think if things if continue to remain the same, the only way a Republican will win in 2028 is if a) a Haley or Christie type on the ballot and / or  b) whoever the Dem candidate is they can't clearly differentiate themselves from both Trump and Biden.   The only way Vance or Rubio could win is if things actually get better.   Strange things are certainly happening right now, but all the current Admin is doing is  assuring that MAGA, and the GOP for the most part, lose.",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T17:17:26,1
Beshear with Kelly as VP would put us in a good position to win the presidency and bring some sanity back to this country. I think Tim Walz though could be great too.,Torracattos,2025-05-09T00:27:47,1
"Yea it was good, and my only issue with him is,in these times, dems need a fucking pitbull that can attack republicans and call out the bullshit and not hold back, Shapiro and Newsom are awesome at doing that, Andy can come across as way too pc at times but then again, he happened to beat maga twice here in ky being that way, but would it translate nationally is the question",FickleSystem,2025-05-09T17:40:09,1

"Who in the Deep South even considers Kentucky 'Southern'?  Anyways, Clinton is from Arkansas, and won, twice.  Obama is from Chicago and despite many concerns from Dems was able to convince Southerners to vote for him.  Twice.   Also, the primaries, debates, and campaign trails are the 'get to know me' parts.",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T17:33:09,1

"I hope that you are a Californian.  Otherwise, oh geez.    Newsom is rather stereotypical, though, which in my opinion is a good thing.  I might be biased here, but I do think that dude has way more going for him than non-Californians may think.",crucial_geek,2025-05-09T17:07:04,2
"The real problem with Newsom is that we've seen him give ground to Republicans in debates like trans rights. That little fuckup completely nuked his support among LGBT folks, and that isn't a bloc that we can lose. He's a good speaker, and generally he's strong in debates, but I dont like him as a pick for president.",blightsteel101,2025-05-09T18:15:03,1
"Oh I agree 100% and she got well deserved criticism for not responding to it, and that program the ad was talking about was actually started under trump!! Lol but she was afraid to offend the lgbtq community so she left it alone, it was very effective and trump knew it would be that's why he spent the most money on that ad, hell I know here in kentucky atleast it was played 10x more than his other ones",FickleSystem,2025-05-09T17:14:34,1
"Obama, no.  Walz, no.  Harris in 2016, no.  Harris in 2024 .... depends on who you ask. I mean, most people probably couldn't tell you what Harris did as VP.  She was kinda just, .... there.  You know, in 2021 she took over for Biden while he was undergoing a colonoscopy.  So for an hour she was legit POTUS making her the first woman POTUS ever.

"I‚Äôm a non-Californian and I think he‚Äôs good. He‚Äôs a bit snarky, charismatic and can outwit any GOP nominee they dredge up. Adam Schiff is my fav but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs interested.

"He said he wasn't with trans ppl ppl competing in woman's sports, and the thing about that is the majority of Americans agree with it..you can still support the lgbtq community but be against that issue, ultimately is it irrelevant because its only a handful of trans ppl doing it?? Yes, but its a culture war issue that dems get their ass kicked on, Andy Brashear called out lies about him supporting trans issues and still won, it can be done without losing support",FickleSystem,2025-05-09T18:23:22,3
"Correct,  if you are not snarky, you are not Californian.    Newsom seems one of the few Dems who is actively trying to figure out what is wrong with the Dem Party.  He has the bonus of being Governor of what is now as of 2025 the 4th largest economy in the world.  He is probably the only Dem who can get big tech and big business backing, for better or worse.   He is also one of the only Dems, and politicians for the matter, who could sell an economic message to the masses.    As for Harris, despite polling way ahead of other possible candidates, I doubt the DNC will run her.  As of now, their main focus for 2028 is to find common ground between progressives and moderates, and to sell the economic message.  Once again, Newsom, despite ticking off some on the left, is one of the only candidates right now who is checking off the most boxes.    AOC will be too young on Inauguration Day to Constitutionally become POTUS, but she could run as VP.    Here is the thing, historically Trump starts talking shit about those he deems as threats early on.  Right now, he is delivering jabs at Newsom and to a lesser extent, AOC.  I know I will get flamed for this, but right now the best Dem ticket would be Newsom with AOC as VP.",crucial_geek,2025-05-10T10:52:52,2
I agree with everything you said but I think (could be wrong) AOC is to the right what MTG to us. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be able to pull anyone from the right but we may not need to. It would be nice though.,Significant_Camp9024,2025-05-10T12:02:21,1
