"People are genuinely ignorant of how bad things are going to get.  I'm trying not to think about it, but I genuinely feel like the economy is about to implode.  With that said, this could reverse course extremely quickly.  Trump could drop the tariffs completely or drop them considerably and it will be more of a hiccup than a collapse.  And to clarify to people who may not quite understand what's going on:  Basically no shipments from China to the US are happening unless it's a somehow exempt product.  Anyone who typically buys from China is exporting from China right now.  145% tariffs are simply too much.  If they were 15%, they'd suck it up and continue doing business.  But 145% is a just too much.  So while warehouses may have inventory today, in a few weeks/months, they're not going to have inventory.  Then if Walmart places an order on that day, you're talking about 30-120 days for production + weeks for shipping.  You could be looking at a 4 month delay in getting the merchandise.  And that's almost best case scenario.  Everyone is going to want to be on the first ships out of China.  So plenty of people will have to wait weeks/months for a ship to become available.  Basically, if Trump doesn't back down soon, end of 2025 we're looking at a MAJOR MAJOR MAJOR economic collapse.",rossmosh85,2025-05-07T18:59:50,46

"Probably buried, but here goes:  Trump is trying to tank the economy to force JPowell to slam down interest rates. This will increase global money supply, a portion of which will go to risky assets. As in: cryptocurrency. Trump's net worth has doubled since the 2024 election to 5 billion. He already made a ton with the Trump and Melania cryptocoins, and his World Liberty Financial has been wheeling and dealing in the crypto space.   Crypto exchange CEOs and others in crypto have told trump about the 4 year bitcoin cycle. Bitcoin, then altcoins, then meme coins are expected to spike up in price around summer-fall 2025. The current total cryptocurrency sits at $3 trillion. There are huge potential profits to be made.  Think about it: why these tariffs NOW? We all know he can reverse them with 1 tweet. Businesses' response to tariffs is to onshore production but they can't if there is too much uncertainty if a new factory in the usa isnt even viable. These tariffs are not to get concessions from other countries, as if this were an intricate foreign policy dance. No, its much simpler than that. The economy of the USA will be sacrificed until the fed chairman lowers interest rates, crypto altcoin prices skyrocket, trump and family collect tens/hundreds of billions in profits, and then trump reverses the tariffs at some point. Maybe timed for the '26 midterms.

"This is the pickle that Powell is in though… because that is actually a half-truth.   The Fed lowers rates to heat up the economy and keeps them higher to cool it. They also keep rates high to cool off inflation. They have a “dual mandate” to keep employment high and inflation low, but a “soft landing” where you are able to stave off a recession while bringing inflation in check is super rare and difficult.   The Fed has done a remarkable job IMO given how bad inflation was.  But then Trump came in just when we were getting that unicorn soft landing and pushed two highly inflationary policies- tariffs and mass deportations. We have the choice now of a terrible recession or hyper inflation (or a substantial amount of both). Trump is right that the Fed could reduce rates to near 0 again and avoid a recession. If he did that, though, inflation would be like nothing we’ve seen in America since the Great Depression. ",porkbellies37,2025-05-08T09:12:22,2

"Well, he was scheduling interest rate cuts based on the Biden administration’s ability to get inflation under control. Cutting interest rates is the final piece to economic recovery that actually people start to feel relief as new money gets pumped into the system. But because Trump fucked up the economy so badly and reversed course  by ridiculous things like tariffs, he has to back off. Counter that with NEGATIVE GDP growth this quarter cutting interest rates is a recipe for stagflation with no ability to fight it. Like why our COVID economics were as bad as they were, Trump forced the Fed to keep interest rates artificially low. It took years to get it back under control and raising interest rates are painful.

Trump isn't wrong that this was going to happen, but the decisions he's making show that he's either incompetent, or actively trying to make it worse.

Older adults have to file for bankruptcy as soon as they get sick, and then lose their insurance (unless they're 65+) in which case, they quickly consume far beyond what they paid into Medicare.  Billionaires bought the dip at every opportunity - with borrowed funds, thanks to low interest rates and quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve - and even when they were wrong, they still got bailed out (by the Fed) in the 70s, the 80s, the 90s, the 2000s, the 2010s, and the 2020s.

Birth rates are at the lowest levels in human history, and we're kicking immigrants out.  This is not just a USA problem. This is a world wide problem. Every country has debt it cannot ever repay. Every country has low birth rates. Every country has tried to increase birth rates, and failed.  Thinking this is somehow sustainable is magical thinking.

I feel like there are people who understand the economy who can't accept that the political situation is actually real cause it sounds too stupid to be real, and people who understand politics who don't understand the financial situation is as bad as it is cause someone is supposed to step in and stop it from getting that bad, and once those people learn to talk to each other, all hell is going to break lose.

CNBC is wildly delusional every time I see anyone interviewed, to the point it seems everyone is just marketing people lying to protect their exposure to US markets and this is accepted as the reality.  Like, no one is discussing the actual practicalities of how tariffs are collected. It's by self reporting by businesses with random spot checks.  Doge has fired half the people who would do any sort of spot check and the tariffs changing every other week makes it basically impossible for businesses to adhere to them even if they wanted to.  The result is indistinguishable from someone trying to intentionally create corruption, because it's easier for companies to just bribe what small amount of spot checkers there are rather than adhering to the varying tariffs.

"The Christian nationalist *Council for National Policy* took over a good chunk of the GOP by the time Trump showed up. Trump teamed up with the CNP to get elected, basically tossing them the keys to his administrations. The CNP knew that this was a limited time opportunity, which is why the changes are so brazen and rapid. They want to tear down the US and reboot it as a revisionist Christian nation without that pesky separation of church and state.  Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)  “Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policy’s] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP. Favorite sons, such as Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, were groomed, financed, and supported.”  “In 2016, the CNP put its partners’ money, data, and ground game behind Donald Trump, as the ultimate transactional candidate. Trump promised it retrograde social policies, a favorable tax regime, regulatory retreats, and its choice of federal judges. He delivered in spades. By 2020, the leaders of the CNP were ready to go to extreme lengths to keep him—and themselves—in power.  Over the final year of the Trump presidency, the CNP took center stage. By January 2020, its leading figures had become sought-after guests on talk shows and frequent visitors to the White House. Many of its stated goals had been advanced. By March, the Republican Senate had confirmed more than 185 of Trump’s conservative nominees for the federal bench. All but eight of the judges had ties to the Federalist Society, headed by longtime CNP members Eugene Meyer and Leonard Leo. Two of the CNP’s favored Supreme Court nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had been confirmed.“  “Donald Trump remained a dependable ally, asking only for an audience for his megalomania and a free pass for the business interests of the ‘Trump brand.’ In return, he delivered his dynamism and his unshakeable base.”  “Ultimate realization of the CNP’s agenda depended on winning a second term for Trump in November. With another four years, it could enshrine its socially regressive policies on the federal level, further blur the line between church and state, and consolidate huge windfalls for corporations and wealthy individuals.”  “Almost half of Trump’s original Evangelical Advisory Board—including Perkins—were members of the CNP, and they were in and out of the Oval Office on a regular basis.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-07T17:32:42,1

>Removing tariffs can also fix the worlds dumbest trade war  I see no evidence that ending the tariffs now would prevent a recession or even a massive depression.. What I'm seeing are threads from people who work in manufacturing saying that there are massive layoffs and their shelves are empty and they can't get the parts they need like the bottles and cans they used to hold their products that happen to be made in the USA.   On top of the trade war don't forget that the massive layoffs and closures of departments is going to flood the economy with highly qualified workers now unemployed. It was already hard to find a job before having to compete with museum docents and people with phds and research scientists.  All of this will have tertiary effects on service workers like me who don't rely on manufacturing. Right now I have clients but how many of those clients will continue to want to invest in my services when runaway inflation starts and the value of their retirement account drops? Since companies are already deciding whether or not to completely shut down or lay off workers and we haven't even started to see empty shelves yet it seems impossible that this is not going to have ripple effects all throughout the economy.  And all over the world countries are setting up new a trade agreements with former enemies because they can no longer trust doing business with the us. And those trade agreements are not going to go away. Heck he even got long-standing enemies like China and Japan to work together on trade.

HOWEVER, CBP (the enforcement authority) has been leveraging ai for large dataset analysis since last year. They piloted it with enforcement around UFLPA, worked the kinks out, and are now using it for broader tariff compliance.   This means a couple of things- one, we can’t count on slipping through the cracks just because there have been government layoffs. Quite the opposite in fact- no one’s hiding from a computer tasked with finding anomalies. The only difference that decreased staffing means for us is that if we do get flagged, having a human review our appeal is now a 6 month+ wait, during which we can’t import from that supplier anymore.  Two, and this is the important part- Trump sees tariffs as a revenue engine. He literally is too dumb to comprehend who even pays for tariffs. So he is not incentivized to remove the tariffs, because from his perspective CBP is one of the few entities actually making money for our country.

"Thanks friend!   So there are 2 aspects of trump that are hard to tie together but after reflecting on whats going on, i've realized the phrase, the goal, the trump aspiration, that ties the 2 disparate strands together.   Lets set the stage:   -trump was essentially acquitted of the worst crime, treason on jan 6, so that means he has defacto presidential immunity on any lesser crimes   -an aquiescent congress and supreme court guarantees his getting away with little crimes (eg--financial ones.)   -by extension, his family falls under this immunity umbrella. They are the only ones guaranteed to get a pardon from trump   -it is assumed that the 2 year clock  of no congressional meddling in trump family affairs will expire when republicans lose the House in '26     So trump knows he has a blank check only for 2 years. Crypto bros have advised him and his family about the impending massive upswing in the crypto economy. The trump sons running the trump family businesses know their activities are extremely corrupt and a huge conflict of interest eg--Getting hotel and real estate deals in Qatar and Serbia while the dad runs foreign policy. And now the family businesses have gone into crypto in an exploitive and nefarious fashion eg-- the Trump and Melania coins that pulled the rug on investors. With trump at the top as essentially the top regulator of the crypto industry, he has positioned himself to tap into the firehose of cash that is building for the expected crypto Bull Run.   But what about the 'idiotic' trump that we see on tv, the one holding up the obvious photoshop of the tatooed hands of Abrego Garcia, the trump of the ridulous quotes (eg-Canadian Pm: ""Canada will never become a US state"". Trump: ""Never say never"".), the trump of Greenland, Panama canal, and Canada rhetoric? Is trump actually too dumb to accomplish his end goal?   THAT trump is a ruse. He plays as his own jester to keep media from sticking onto his corrupt activites. The link in my previous post shows its extent. But WHY?    The answer is simple. Abysmal. Daunting. Monstrous. Horrific.   Obvious.    It is not just about riches, wealth, greed. It is about the only word that will satiate him, and he wont stop until it is acheived. It is the phrase that once it was uttered in the closed door meeting between trump family and crypto bros could not be unheard. A phrase of utter villanous depravity. A phrase seemingly worth sacrificing the wealth of the usa on the seawalls of agressive tarrifs.    The immutable goal worth sacrificing the global economic order:   ""Trump the Trillionaire""",ILuv2Learn,2025-05-09T08:29:27,1

"> But you might not even end up in a bad economy  First of all, all modern economies are cyclical in nature. They have good moments and bad moments. **This is by design**.  Countries obviously don't want what happened in 2008 in America to happen, but sometimes things get leveraged too much and that happens.   But cycle economies are still how modern economies work.  Oh, and by the way, do you know what the Fed did in 2008 to help save America? Slashed the interest rates to zero. Fucking zero. Which is exactly what I'm talking about: Lowering interest rates to save your nation at hard times.  Now speaking to your points...  - 1:  No, it doesn't. Low interest rates, while not the main driving force, are known to increase inflation. So no, it doesn't allow people to retain more money each month. Because of inflation. Again: high interest rates are used exactly to curb inflation.   If you have higher inflation because you artificially lowered the interest rates, then how the fuck are you saving money?  - 2: Which is exactly why when the economy is at a downturn you want to lower the interest rates: To incentivize people to expand their business and create new ones.   What are you not understanding about this? This is a very simple concept.  If the economy is strong then that means you already have a lot of jobs. When the economy *starts* to go bad, a lot of people lose their job, and then the lower interest rates come in to try to create more jobs and businesses.  Doing that when the economy is already strong means that if the economy goes tits up even **with** those conditions you then have absolutely no recourse to get a new foot holding. You're fucked. There's about a dozen stories about countries that did this, leveraged the fuck out of their already strong economy, and ended up in depressions. **Not recessions, depressions.**  You're literally left with very little strategies to overturn a bad economy in that case.  I said this before, I'll say this again: Controlling interest rates by making them low in bad economies and high in solid economies is **literally economy for countries 101**.  - 3: Yeah, and that is done by, you guessed it, lowering rates. Lowering rates increase the amount of money being invested into the economy by people taking out these loans, for creating business and creating new jobs, new cars, whatever.   I'm sorry for saying this, but I don't think you have even the slightest grasp on the subject if you're not understanding such a basic concept.  You've got literally everything wrong.  Like, how the hell did you come to the idea that people would retain more money with lower interest rates? Are you maybe confusing lower interest rates = low inflation? I cannot even fathom that concept unless you're confusing these 2 things.",Real-Tailor7489,2025-05-09T20:32:21,1

To me, I hear that phrase and I think they told us in the name what the intent of that policy was. Allow a ""trickle"" of wealth to most Americans while accumulating as much as possible themselves. It seems that a little peak behind the curtain and just taking their name for the policy at face value would have given the whole game away.   Kind of like taxing the ultra rich. I get that most people *think* they will be there one day, but most people won't. So I struggle to understand why so many people getting median pay would be so adamant that taxing the ultra wealthy (anyone with more than 1M/year income or  greater than about 10-20M net worth) is a bad thing. Just make sure exceptions exist for people to pass things like their farm to their family if they actually are farmers (none of this rich guy ""farmer"" stuff). This seems pretty easy and rational and wouldn't impact 99% of people and the exceptions would be easy enough.   Curious to hear why 2009/2010?",im_a_squishy_ai,2025-05-07T17:44:03,1

Ranked choice excites me because people can vote for who they actually like the most, and if their candidate loses, but nobody reached a 50% threshold, their second candidate gets their support. And so on and so on, until someone gets over 50%. So it really REALLY encourages people to truly vote for who they like, and to ultimately have a say in who wins.

"Thank you! This needs to be said more frequently and louder. The Republicans like to sabotaging systems then declare them not working then privatize them for their own personal profit. Privatization leads to fewer people receiving the services which become more expensive. It's general theft of public funds. You've seen this recently with the FAA and the push to let Musk run it. You are seeing this with the sale of public lands. You are seeing this with the dismantling of the TVA leadership. You can see how privatization of the Texas power grid 24 years ago wrecked it. The TVA runs very well in Tennessee and will soon be privatized and TN's electric grid will look like the Texas' soon.  Dec 3, 2002 Dick DeVos, husband to Betsy and investor in for-profit schools, declared war on public education to the Heritage Foundation declaring their stealth strategy could destroy public education in 10 years using charter schools and vouchers. They also encouraged over use of for-profit standardized testing, under resourcing schools, right teacher turnover, high student to teacher ratio, etc.  Have you ever found yourself bad mouthing public education in America? Have you ever shared a meme saying higher education is too expense and we need more trades people such as plumbers and welders? Are you pro vouchers or charter schools? If so, you have been influenced by the Heritage Foundation.

"Here is a hint, Jerome Powell lies, it's a part of his job.    Powells job is to manage inflationary pressures and ensure liquidity in the overall market, he has a few levers to do this, one of which is what he says during these press briefings.     If he believes a lie will help to achieve those goals, he will lie through his teeth, if he believes the truth will help those goals, he will tell the truth, if he believes saying a bunch of big finance words to say not much at all, he's going to do that.  That's his job.  That's the reason many people don't really listen to what the fed actually says, but instead watch what they do.    Do they raise rates?  They see inflation becoming a problem or the economy growing too quickly and want to limit the money supply.    Do they lower rates?  They see the potential for a recession and want to increase the money supply to facilitate spending to blunt the recession.  Do they hold rates steady?  They see everything is solid, or they aren't sure what policy they need to implement yet and are waiting for more data to make a decision.  The reason trump wants rates lowered is because he's super focused on the stock market and lower rates would artificially inflate security prices making the stock market bullish.  The issue is that policy is inflationary and the last thing the Fed wants to do is push inflationary policy when they see other major inflationary economic pressures.",pj1843,2025-05-07T19:17:29,-2

You don't seem to understand how the fed's interest rates affect the economy, which is perfectly reasonable unless you happen to have studied economics.   >Refusing to lower rates when the economy is going south  Lowering rates would actually make it go south faster.  The Fed has a long-term target inflation rate of 2% which is generally agreed upon by economists as a healthy level.  It balances employment against inflation in an optimal way.  Interest rates set by the fed help control that rate of inflation.  If predicted inflation is too high they raise rates which reduces borrowing; if predicted inflation is too low, they lower rates.  [Source Link](https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research/inflation-101/why-does-the-fed-care-start#:~:text=When%20inflation%20is%20too%20high%2C%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20typically%20raises%20interest%20rates%20to%20slow%20the%20economy%20and%20bring%20inflation%20down.%20When%20inflation%20is%20too%20low%2C%20the%20Federal%20Reserve%20typically%20lowers%20interest%20rates%20to%20stimulate%20the%20economy%20and%20move%20inflation%20higher).  We are currently in a position of very high inflation, caused by the current tariff situation.  Normally under high inflation the Fed would raise interest rates to ""cool off"" the economy, but in this case they understand that raising rates would not affect the tariffs, and thus could not meet the goal of driving inflation toward 2% the way such a hike normally does.  However, if they were to lower rates, more borrowing would happen which increases inflation.  Adding some fed-rate-based inflation to the tariff-based inflation would make the inflation even worse than it is right now.",laseralex,2025-05-07T16:58:02,7

"He contradicted their idol. In an authoritarian regime, you don’t do that if you want to maintain status. Status is tethered to how far you can bend the knee, which is why you see so many civil servants making humiliating assertions to Trumps accuracy, even when he contradicts himself. For them, there is a culture of subservience in ideology. To not serve the chosen one via shared ideology is to be wrong and worthy of scrutiny. This is how Trump has seeded his power, produced a consistently reliable defense against truth, cultivated an ideology that he is a man of destiny who supersedes the norms and knowledges of modern times, and you’re seeing the blossoms of that seeded reality now.   This is why they tell you to just trust Trump. They’ve contorted his victory against our legal system, his defiance of public opinion, his attempted and failed assassination, his unreckoned defiance of the courts, and other events as signals of virtue.  So you see in this term, Trump surrounded by yes men. It’s funny because Trumps own success may be in part due to the fact that we was surrounded by people his first term who sort of saw their role as buffering and simmering down the presidents levels of crazy. In effect, that played a role in this newfound idea amongst his followers that Trump defies modern understanding, that he needs to be trusted. So now they’ve removed the buffer and we get all of Trumps stupidity.   Worse even, there’s a littering of these radical supporters throughout our government now, who are also disillusioned with this idea of Trumps supremacy, willing to break norms in furtherance of Trump’s agenda. So you see also, compliance—in places like the FBI, for example, despite what the courts may rule. They’re sold on this idea that Trump controls the executive’s interpretation of law, not because they necessarily believe it, but because it conveniently justifies the culture they’ve found themselves within.

"> Once they started catering to Tea Party, this is the result.   Perennial response to this, but IMHO, the rot started FAR sooner than that.  The Tea Party was just another symptom.  I was born in 67, so my politics start around the end of Carter, beginning of Reagan, so read this with that viewpoint in mind.  I put the responsibility for MAGA at the feet of Lee Atwater, Newt Gingrich, the Moral Majority, the NRA, Ronald Reagan and pick your pro-life group from the 70s onward.  Newt Gingrich pioneered in marketing the monetized and weaponized mailing list.  Atwater, the MM, NRA, and pro-life groups started the fear ratchet in their mailers to frighten old ladies out of their pension money.  Fear ratchet:  > ""they're teaching that people come from monkeys in the school! Give now to put GOD back in the schools! Gay teachers are indoctrinating your children! There's fetuses in your vaccines!""  Each story has to be more frightening than the last to get people who've been on the list for a while and have seen all the old stories to open their wallets yet again.  Run this ratchet for a few decades and you get to   > ""They're eating the dogs, they're eating the cats.  {Your town} is a police no-go zone!  Sharia Law!""  Ronald Reagan put the nail in the coffin when he removed the fairness doctrine from those broadcasters using FCC-regulated airwaves.  The processes set in motion by these actors and their innovations led naturally, directly, and inexorably to the low-information, fear-motivated, primed-for-violence populace we see today.

Some crops and goods are simply grown/manufactured more efficiently in certain climates and countries. We can have a lower carbon impact even shipping those goods across the world from the more productive climates at scale, than every American having a victory garden with far less productive yields.  >But long term this damages us, becoming champions of global free trade the way we had it 10 years ago is terrible long term  In hindsight, we needed to support trade agreements like TPP 10 years ago that allowed us incentivize partner nations to raise the labor standards of their citizens and form economic blocks against polluters and slavers.

"Vulture capitalists and others depend on a typical US recession with an average duration of 3.5 years.   The US is often the first into recession and the first out because the USD and bonds have been seen as a safe store of capital and provide funds for stimulus and growth.  Once the USD and bonds are abandoned as the reserve currency of choice and a safe store of wealth then it becomes almost impossible to extract itself from recession.  It also increases the risk of sovereign default and the USA begins to resemble Donnie Two Dolls bankrupt casinos.  China and Japan are drawing down on their bond reserves to keep their economies afloat with stimulus and support. The USD is sinking in accordance with this and the longer this goes on the greater the risk of a death spiral into economic collapse.  Other nations and major investors may be forced to pull the plug before value is completely destroyed.  Add to this the total collapse of  its reputation , trust and confidence throughout the globe and this must result in the flight of capital , and it is rapidly approaching.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-07T18:29:44,1

"That won’t happen for decades; private armies can be extremely capable and by the time the USA is Balkanized everyone else will be busy with their own conflicts  See India Pakistan kicking things off early  Whether or not you liked US hegemony and political power, US diplomatic soft power backed by the capability of the Big Stick kept global conflicts managed/prevented or at least made everyone come to the table.  The USA had been keeping the world in an Entente Cordiale - the destruction of our diplomatic corps, the demolishment of our reputation, and the end of the internal stability of the USA mean all these conflicts that have been kept at bay have fewer if not no brakes applied.  Worse, the US military dominance is years from being supplanted and all another country has to do to get it pointed where it wants it is to pay Trump enough. That will happen before the USA is Balkanized enough for it not to matter and, if it happens after balkanization, everyone else will be preoccupied with their own conflicts.

">They’ve under thought the entire idea. Let’s say billionaires balkanize the US. You know what happens next?  I'm not convinced anyone in power actually wants that to happen. They saw how much subsequent economic value Russia lost out on and they're not keen on repeating that same mistake.  I would assume that they'll attempt to consolidate and maintain executive power as heavily as possible, and it'll likely be through strong national controls that are contingent on explicitly maintaining the sovereignty of the US. Which means that their plans likely follow the Heritage foundation's outline, rather than the neofeudal musings of a software developer.  And beyond that reasoning, it would be more work to try to break up the most powerful military force in the world instead of simply preserving the direct control that's already held over it.  You're glossing over the fact that *they already have the power*, they don't need to win people over or stress about ratings. Oppositional disruptions that warrant military intervention and loud shows of public discontent are only going to hasten the crackdown stage of the totalitarian process, not hinder it.  For some reason you think you're going to *gain power* when every average America has measurably *less of everything.* And you think that's going to happen when federal forces are going after groups and individuals that the majority of Americans see as reasonable targets?  That's not how this works, and you're counting your chickens well before they've hatched.  Please stop trying to convince others that these people don't have a plan. They have a much more thought out and well-crafted one than any group on the opposite side, and they've stuck to it for 30 years or more at this point. It's just so tedious to see people saying ""Oh, wait, and now *here's* the point where they finally screw it all up.""

For example,  The entire trans arguments of the last few years was coming from the GOP/Trump/Special Interests. They made it a forefront cultural outrage topic. Daily social media outrage over 20 trans athletes. Appeal to emotion language designed to invoke strong emotions like ""daughters in bathrooms with men wearing wigs"" or ""children being experimented on"" despite this framing being 1000% bigoted and flat out lies.  There's a reason why Kamala Harris barely mentioned trans people in her campaign, while Trump had an entire section on his campaign page for it, talked about it incessantly in his rallies, and took out entire ad campaigns targeting trans women. It proves unequivocally that Trump was using this topic as a tool of manipulation, while dems only cared about trans people so far as wanting EVERYONE to have rights to living freely and openly.",JournalistRecent1230,2025-05-07T16:28:06,277

"That was also when I said that I would never vote for a republican again.  For anyone that wasn't around during the start of the Iraq/Afgan war, the American public did not want to start a new war, especially another one with Iraq, even after the events of 9/11.  The only reason they were able to get the public on board with their war plans is because they blatantly and repeatedly lied about Iraq have nuclear weapons.  They absolutely assured us all that we had to go in and stop them from making weapons of mass destructions, and it wouldn't cost us anything to do so because we'd make whatever money it cost back on all the oil we would capture.  Every UN inspector said they had no nukes, but we as a people believed the republicans anyway because every town in America has a conservative radio stations that plays propaganda 24/7.  So why did the republicans want to push this was so badly?  Because the VP was Cheney who was the former CEO of Halaburton, which is the company that got all those lucrative wartime defense contracts.  So the republicans ended up putting us in a 20+ year long war that cost trillions of dollars and 10's of thousands of lives all so republican corporate interest could make bank off the war.  Republicans view the military the same why they view everyone else in this country, as a bunch of marks they can scam money from.

"That the Antichrist will claim to be the Jewish Messiah and will (at first) be falsely recognized so is the traditional interpretation, yes.  The traditional interpretation is that John 5:41-44 refers to the Antichrist:  >I do not receive honor from men. But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you. I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. How can you believe, who receive honor from one another, and do not seek the honor that comes from the only God?  One interpretation is that Matthew 24:23-25 refers to the Antichrist:  >Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There!’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand.  Another interpretation is that it is rather Matthew 24:15-22 that refers to the Antichrist, who will rebuild the Jewish temple in Jerusalem (being thought to be the prophesied Messiah) but will then, to the horror of the Jews, take his seat in the Holy of Holies and claim to be God Himself, in a twisted parody of Christianity:  >Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place … then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.  Likewise, in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4:  >Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.  Revelation is a terribly difficult text to understand, but the traditional interpretation is that the Antichrist will be a Jew from the tribe of Dan, which is why this tribe is excluded from the 144,000 elect (Revelation 7:4-8). They are the Jews who will convert to Christianity because of the preaching of Elijah and the evident falsehood of the Antichrist (Revelation 11:3-13; 12; 14:1-5).  As Paul prophesies in Romans 11:24-29:  >If you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, who are natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree? For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come out of Zion, and He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob; for this is My covenant with them, when I take away their sins.” Concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but concerning the election they are beloved for the sake of the fathers. For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.  Sometimes, Old Testament passages are traditionally interpreted as referring to this Antichrist from Dan, who at first is recognized as the Jewish Messiah but later turns out to be anything but, and to Elijah converting the Jews to Christianity as well, for instance:  >Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. Dan shall be a serpent by the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse’s heels so that its rider shall fall backward. I have waited for your salvation, O Lord! (Genesis 49:16-18)  >He shall return and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. And forces shall be mustered by him, and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress; then they shall take away the daily sacrifices, and place there the abomination of desolation. Those who do wickedly against the covenant he shall corrupt with flattery; but the people who know their God shall be strong, and carry out great exploits. And those of the people who understand shall instruct many; yet for many days they shall fall by sword and flame, by captivity and plundering. Now when they fall, they shall be aided with a little help; but many shall join with them by intrigue. And some of those of understanding shall fall, to refine them, purify them, and make them white, until the time of the end; because it is still for the appointed time. Then the king shall do according to his own will: he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god, shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been determined shall be done. He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for he shall exalt himself above them all. But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses; and a god which his fathers did not know he shall honor with gold and silver, with precious stones and pleasant things. (Daniel 11:30-38)  >Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse. (Malachi 4:5-6)  Finally, your interpretation is incorrect because there has been no international peace deal with Israel, where they experience an unprecedented 3 and a half years of total peace under the Antichrist. Once the peace is broken, the Antichrist will attempt to exterminate all Jews worldwide and it will be clear at this point that the figure is the Antichrist.   >And he shall make a strong covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he shall put an end to sacrifice and offering. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed end is poured out on the desolator.” (Daniel 9:27)  >Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. (2 Thessalonians 2:3–4)  There is also no current Temple, which as you can see, is also required at the 3 and a half year point. It is hard to see the Antichrist appearing before the third Temple is built, but impossible for the midway point of the seven years to occur before the Temple is present.",greganada,2025-05-08T11:06:01,0

"Not to nitpick, but Blitzkrieg was 100% about overwhelming as many countries as possible and seizing their gold stores before they could be moved.   The biggest difference we can see today is that the new fascists are trying to take the mountain while they’re standing on top of it. As you might imagine, destabilizing the mountain while you’re standing on it is likely a big misstep.   The *people* of the US, every day people, are in the dirt. They want things to change. But these fucks have propagated a very successful culture war while clandestinely consolidating an economic disparity rarely seen before in the history of the world. You can’t expect that when you prod the masses into “taking back their government from the culturally unfit” that you won’t get swept up in the unrest. It’s never been done. People who have extravagant means stand out as clear targets to anyone in the proletariat moving to revolt, and they hubristically think they can point their brainwashed masses to only take out the rich people they don’t like.   Germany was in generationally crippling debt for losing WWI. It was very easy to scapegoat the bankers and creditors and make the citizenry wipe out the people associated with their financial troubles, as well as the cultural misfits and political opponents of the Nazis. All of that was achieved due to one motivating factor- the people were told that if they set all of this in motion that the Nazis would right the wrong of them footing the bill for the Great War. The Project 2025 people don’t have that promise. They don’t have that kind of pull because the US is the richest county in the world. There’s no skin in the game and a lot of the kind of people that buy into MAGA are already comfortable and can repeat the rhetoric from the comfort of their office job their dad put them in and their half million dollar home that’s already been paid off.   Now the other thing about Blitzkrieg is that by the time Germany reached France there was already a mad scramble to move all the physical wealth away from the advancing forces and ship it to GB and the US.
