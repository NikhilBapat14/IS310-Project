No there wasn't. Because Obama and Biden did not deport people simply because they were deportable.  There's also a difference between deportations from the interior versus apprehensions at the border. Biden and Obama didn't make it a habit to deport innocent people who weren't a threat to national or public safety.  Trump is deporting people just because he can and without allowing them due process...because fuck laws and fuck the constitution.,ImpressSeveral3007,2025-04-29T16:18:24,10
There exists a process already. The burden of proof is less than a criminal court to have someone deported. They're also deporting folks following the process and checking in as required.   They choose not to follow that process and laugh at the Constitution. Anyone supporting this is a fucking traitor to the United States. Due process is the fucking cornerstone of our nation and WAY too many people celebrate it's erosion because they're racist as fuck.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-04-29T16:24:56,8

"Maybe not at the same level, but I was at one of these protests for exactly that during Obama’s time in office.  2014: “President Barack Obama has lost the nation’s largest Latino advocacy organization.”  “By April, Obama will have overseen more than 2 million deportations, activists say, far more than any previous president. Obama has insisted… that Congress has tied his hands and he cannot reduce the number of people being deported unilaterally. Latino groups are planning a series of mass demonstrations April 5 to protest the deportations and force lawmakers to choose between criticizing Obama or facing a populist wrath.”  It’s interesting to see how little authority Obama thought he had over congress when it comes to border enforcement compared to Trump.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-29T16:13:00,4

Why is it so hard to believe that most people that enter illegally are illegible for a legal visa. There is a reason that so many illegal immigrants are criminals. It’s because they wouldn’t pass a thorough screening.

The law is the law as a justification for any atrocity, but it suddenly no longer applies when it’s not convenient. Laws should be based on practical realities, and punishments should be proportional to the crime. People who entered illegally who have otherwise been law abiding citizens and contributing members of society can be punished in a number of ways beyond deportation.

You just showed you know absolutely nothing. You may only enter the United States without a visa for tourism or business for up to 90 days. If you plan to live work or go to school here you have to apply for a visa first and then abide by those terms to stay. So go do some research and come back. Having the immigration visa for 5 years is what they mean by a legal resident. You have to have an immigration visa which you must apply for first and there are requirements to maintain that.
