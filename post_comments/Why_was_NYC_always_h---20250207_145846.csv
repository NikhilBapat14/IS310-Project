"The story that Democrats and Republicans ""switched"" positions sometime in the 30s is an oversimplification. Democrats and Republicans were big-tent parties with Progressive and Conservative factions. Republicans, after the Civil War, while taking the ""left"" stance on Reconstruction and Civil Rights,  very quickly became associated with Northern Business interests. Democrats took the mantle of ""populism.""   The Progressive movement within both the Republican and Democratic parties vied for the vote of the urban working class, while Democrats increasingly embraced the populist concerns of midwestern farmers (along with their white southern base). The Democrats also developed close ties to""white ethnics,"" Jewish, Irish, Italian, and, to a lesser extent, Germans. This coalition,  white ethnics,  some portion of the working class, and anyone annoyed with whoever the Republican president was quickly became a majority in NYC  People also voted for more based on the relationships they had with local politicians and the Tammany Hall Society, which ran NYC politics for about a hundred years from around the 1860s to the 1940s and was close with the Democratic party   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8VOM8ET1WU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8VOM8ET1WU)  [https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/26233](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/26233)  [https://archives.nypl.org/mss/2946](https://archives.nypl.org/mss/2946)",loselyconscious,2025-02-09T14:56:45,7
"NYC’s been heavily Democratic since the 1800s due to its diverse, working-class immigrant population, strong labor unions, and urban reliance on public services. Tammany Hall used to buy votes, back in the good old days... The shirt waist factory fire roused people AND showed them that they had power.  Democrats built loyalty through aid and policies like the New Deal, while the city’s liberal, educated vibe keeps it blue. GOP wins (like Giuliani) are rare and usually moderate. Dems outnumber Republicans 6 to 1 today.  sources: [1] Politics of New York (state) - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_New_York_(state) [2] Presidential voting trends in New York - Ballotpedia https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_voting_trends_in_New_York [3] New York State Democratic Party - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Democratic_Party [4] New York Presidential Election Voting History - 270toWin.com https://www.270towin.com/states/new-york [5] Party Divisions | US House of Representatives - History, Art & Archives https://history.house.gov/Institution/Party-Divisions/Party-Divisions/ [6] Tammany Hall - Papers Of Abraham Lincoln https://papersofabrahamlincoln.org/organizations/TA38107 [7] Maps - NYC Election Atlas https://www.electionatlas.nyc/maps.html [8] Tammany Hall | Definition, History, Significance, & Boss Tweed https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tammany-Hall",laurelii,2025-04-15T20:15:40,1
"It's interesting how voting demographics play out. We have a desire to graph our current post new deal left vs right divides on past which doesn't really work. The Republicans were were the progressive reformers and champions of civil rights and sufferage but were nativists, imperialist, and agressively pro business.",Icy-Acanthaceae-6816,2025-02-10T12:26:15,2
