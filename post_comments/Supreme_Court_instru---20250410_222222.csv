"He’s dead, same as the gay hairdresser, there no body (bodies) they have been disappeared, likely like me after writing this comment. “If” they could return them, they would… throw them some cash, tell them to STFU or you and you entire family go and you don’t come back ever. But they can’t do that, because they are forever disappeared. RIP to both and many others. This is no joke, it may not effect you now, but it’s going to get a lot worse.",Mcboatface3sghost,2025-04-10T23:27:10,18
