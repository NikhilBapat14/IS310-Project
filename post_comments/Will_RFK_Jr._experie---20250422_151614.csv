"As someone with Autism and with at least one child who is also affected, this is deeply upsetting to me.   I've spent a good portion of my life dealing with these bullshit negative stereotypes. I'm a productive citizen. I've been employed all my adult life. I hold 3 bachelors, a masters, have some credits towards a PhD, and recently began a career transition by starting law school. I own and operate 2 small businesses. And you know what all that means? I've paid a whole hell of a lot in taxes. If I can do all that, I can certainly use the toilet.   It's a gross generalization and mischaracterization. I want my kids to grow up in a world that accepts them rather than makes assumptions about them.   I'm more divided with my family over RFK than over Trump. They at least recognize some of the nonsense from Trump",Brickscratcher,2025-04-24T13:42:50,9

"No.  The key to all of their concerns about Autism is that it is something that *they* caused in their children. These are loving parents, at their core, who are terrified that they have somehow cursed their child to a life of living less-than a 'normal person'. That's how they frame Autism in their minds: its not merely a way that some people are, it's a condition that otherises and diminishes an individuals ability to live a normal and well-adjusted life. Every parent wants to do everything in their power to raise their children to be healthy, whole, and well-adjusted so that they can succeed in life and find happiness and be independent so no parent would willingly want to feed their children substances that they thought would harm their well-being, to subject them to an environmental factor that would make them unwell or even alter their bodies.   Lastly because Autism is an otherising debilitating condition (they think), and they are physically and/or mentally normal (they believe), then having an Autistic child means something caused that (they conclude), something is to blame, and they want reassurance that it wasn't their fault. They want someone to tell them that their Child isn't mental broken and fucked up for life because of something They did, and to an extent that includes deciding to have a child and it turns out to be a product of genetics. They want to blame something, they want to be able to point at the problem and keep their children safe from it. You can't do that if its just something You're born as, in fact that makes it worse because then (in the way they think) it is entirely Their fault.",Fofolito,2025-04-24T09:26:17,4
"The families of people with autism that are high-functioning are probably not part of his constituency.  The families of people with severe, disabling autism probably don't think he characterized the population inaccurately.  You know how people call the urge to clean small messes or straighten stacks of paper as OCD, even though they're not diagnosed? Have you ever heard a person with diagnosed OCD get upset about it, saying something to the effect of ""I actually have OCD and I have to wash my hands until they're completely raw because I can't stop thinking about the way everything outside of my house is covered in a thin layer of AIDS semen?""  I think the same thing is happening with autism, but the ""annoyed by misaligned papers"" guy is actually diagnosed as well. ""Awkward guy who is way more into trains than is normal"" and ""guy who screams if he thinks about touching something made of wool"" are both diagnosed with autism, but the family that has to take care of their 30 year old autistic child because they can't even feed themselves isn't going to feel like the guy who introduces himself by talking about his recent fascination with legos has ""real"" autism.  I don't think the families of people who turn out to be socially awkward bioengineers with an obsession with telescopes are that concerned with finding a cause or cure for autism, and there's a good chance they're going to be against it, and there's a good chance they already didn't like RFK Jr.  The families with disabled autistic children probably very much want to find a cause and cure, probably supported RFK Jr., and probably don't see any problem with any of his recent statements.",lakotajames,2025-04-24T08:44:27,11

"I think you’ll find a large part of people that like (and agree with) RFK Jr are parents of autistic or disabled children.

"Can someone explain to me what the motivation and end game of this autism thing is?  Like, I don't care if he wants to tell everyone he's gonna do a bunch of research that's already been done, to find a cause that doesn't exist.  Whatever.  But why does he want to do that?  The number of people who support that effort can't be very large, relatively speaking, right?  We're talking mostly middle-aged white suburban women, I assume.  They vote, they influence their friends and tik tok followers, I get that.  But does the party really stand to gain anything by making a big show of this one specific—oddly specific—thing?  And what's the outcome they're looking for?  Who benefits either way?  He does all of this magical research and concludes there are no environmental factors.  Then what?  He crunches a bunch of weird data and concludes that red food dye makes people autistic.  OK, whatever.  This was all a scheme to go after Big Red 40?  Who wins in that scenario?  The Plant-based Food Dye Coalition of America?  I just don't get it.  I'm missing something that makes the entire issue actually meaningful.    The only stuff I can come up with is like really nefarious conspiracy shit that I don't accept as real.   Like, in the end, you're going to sue some big food conglomerate and make them pay all of the Medicare bills for these people?  You're gonna round everyone up and say they can't vote because the vaccines hurt their brains?  And that's just it—what good does shitting on vaccines do for anyone?

"Ha ha, I'm back!  >Second point, Sure he was educated but now that education is considered misinformation  Yes, but only because someone else decided it was misinformation. Unless (or until) there's some physical marker that distinguishes different forms of autism, or even between people with and without autism, it's all ""made up"" in a sense. Medical professionals are going to defer to the consensus of other medical professionals, who defer to other medical professionals, who made it up. I'm not saying it's wrong of them to make it up: we can't just ignore autism until we find a marker, someone has to draw some lines somewhere so we know what they're talking about.  So, RFJ Jr. is wrong because he's not following the current medical consensus, but he's also not wrong because the current medical consensus is just semantics anyway. As long as the people he's talking to know what he's talking about, he's not any less correct than anyone else. Which means he's wrong again: The existence of this thread proves that. But then again, he explicitly says he's referring to people that meet the following criteria: ""They'll never pay taxes, they'll never hold a job, they'll never play baseball, they'll never write a poem, they'll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted."" I think there's an argument to be made that if the listener doesn't agree with those statements as they apply to autism, then the listener already knows he's not using the same definition of ""autism"" as they are. And, again, the people who are upset about these statements probably didn't support him to begin with, and the language he used was probably not chosen with those people in mind.",lakotajames,2025-04-29T10:37:48,1

">I am willing to admit that I do not have the full context of this quote but if he said those words verbatim,  Me neither, I just copied from the OP.  > he's using an outdated definition that directly opposes the modern, widely accepted definition.  That's true, but the ""widely accepted definition"" isn't based on *truth*, so he can't be *wrong* unless he's specifically saying that his definition is the ""widely accepted definition."" In fact, if the people he's talking to widely accept his definition, then he's more accurate than he would be if he were to use the ""correct"" definition.  The people who gave us the ""modern, widely accepted definition"" weren't divinely inspired and have no physical evidence, so the only meaning that matters is the ones the speaker and listener understand you to be referring to, and he went as far as to clarify specifically what definition he was using.  >I don't know if you are trying to play devil's advocate or something   Kinda lol. I don't like RFK Jr. myself. I just think that his error only matters to the people who trust the ones that came up with the definition, and the ven diagram showing ""people who like RFK Jr."" and ""people who don't trust the people who defined autism"" has both circles almost completely overlapping, so it's a useless thing to get in a huff about.",lakotajames,2025-04-29T11:26:17,1

His intention is obviously also very important but he should try to avoid as much confusion as possible. You argue that him and the listeners likely share the same definition so he gets his point across just fine. I argue that the listeners are more familiar with the other definition, in which case his ideas could easily be misinterpreted.
