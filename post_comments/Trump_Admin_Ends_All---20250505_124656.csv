I love how petty the right is. Went to the site and the top story under MOST POPULAR is [Jasmine Crockett accused of cutting in airport line](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/05/04/democrat-leader-hopeful-jasmine-crockett-accused-cutting-airport-line/),travio,2025-05-05T12:52:25,15

I’m not seeing anything about this from anywhere other than sources sympathetic to Nazis. I adopted one of these beagles nearly 3 years ago so I can’t help but wonder if they are trying to take credit for something that someone else did.  Edit: I’ve seen sources claiming that Fauci started the experiment and Trump stopped them which is obviously bullshit. I’m not linking them as I don’t want to give them clicks.,deuteronpsi,2025-05-05T15:05:44,3

"https://x.com/NIH/status/1919070337225855335  ps    Here's PETA - I'm sure you're going to accuse them of being in cahoots with Trump or something:  https://x.com/peta/status/1919145946895565005  >Edit: I’ve seen sources claiming that Fauci started the experiment and Trump stopped them which is obviously bullshit. I’m not linking them as I don’t want to give them clicks.  I mean, if this ended now, of course the practice happened under Fauci. During his tenure, there were grants approved to experiments with beagles.   https://bfp.org/beagle-org-demands-dr-fauci-stop-supporting-animal-testing/  Plenty of sources on this.  I don't think Fauci himself would deny that he supports these experiments - lots of people do, and it's very prevalent among scientists of Fauci's generation.",labegaw,2025-05-05T18:04:39,1
