I’ve loved everything Pritzker has done and said this year. He has plenty of time to mess up but i’d strongly support him for 2028.,builtrobtough,2025-04-28T12:33:09,4

Democrats won big in Wisconsin by targeting Musk. It would be so on brand for them to abandon the oligarchy narrative that works and use their own mega billionaire to blunt that attack on Republicans    Nothing like some controlled opposition that wants to win but only close enough that they can use Republicans as an excuse to not actually do anything ,ActualModerateHusker,2025-04-28T11:08:22,3

The emotional decision democrats have run out of actions that do nothing but make them feel good about themselves. They don’t know what to do because that is all they have ever known. Actual action is too scary.,Limp-Technician-7646,2025-04-28T13:12:33,0
"~~I don't really consider this ""putting your neck on the line."" Between Newsom and Pritzker, I'm a little disappointed that, so far, the go-to for 2028 candidates appears to be parroting Republican propaganda.~~  Edit: I was wrong. New York Times chose to propagandize their headline (along with Politico). Pritzker did not. Still, fuck Newsom, though.",Grandpa_No,2025-04-28T10:15:57,1
Yeah Newsome can pound sand. JB has not compromised on his morals at all.,friendsafariguy11,2025-04-28T10:32:32,4
