Democrats want immigration reform that provides a realistic path to citizenship for those non citizens who have been working and paying taxes and will continue to pay taxes into the future. Republicans want a boogie man.,Legitimate_Rent_5976,2025-04-12T09:52:14,14

"As a Democrat, I'm curious. What do Democrats want when it comes to illegal immigration? Do they want illegal immigrants left alone? Do they want them deported? Do they want to give them a path to citizenship?   It seems like the argument anymore is to just leave them alone. Am I right?   Honest question, really.",VintageLV,2025-04-12T05:43:13,4

"As an American expat, I don‚Äôt understand why my fellow Democrats think it‚Äôs acceptable for anyone to flaunt our immigration laws. I‚Äôm all for anyone who wants to live in the U.S., just do it legally. No one has the right to enter/remain in another country with that country‚Äôs permission.",OrionDax,2025-04-12T06:26:32,1

"Obama exported more immigrants than Trump or Biden.  Democrats want legal immigration.  Republicans want cruelty.  Just deporting people is a bandage.  They can just try again and re-enter.  These are people that have gone through hell trying to get to the US.  They want a better life for themselves and their children. They won‚Äôt give up that easy.    What democrats want is an improved system. More immigration judges so the legal process can go faster, funding for more ICE agents,etc.  A bipartisan bill in 2024 was to make reforms such as this was agreed upon in the senate.  Trump told them to crush it.  He didn‚Äôt want the immigration issue solved.  He wanted a show. He wants to feel like a king.   What democrats want is up holding the constitution and judicial rulings.  Everyone has the right to due process per the rights outlined in the constitution, regardless of your citizenship status.  What democrats don‚Äôt want is for illegal immigrates to be treated humane. The government is kidnapping people off the streets. Whether you‚Äôre republican or democrat, this should terrify everyone.",BudgetNoise1122,2025-04-12T12:36:40,5
"Democrats have been more beneficial over time to allow immigrants the access of education, health care, and citizenship compared to their republican counterparts. The Republican party is trying to find a ""common enemy"" to help unite their cause, and to justify these actions. It's far more complicated than that, but that is what I see at this moment",Nangerho,2025-04-12T05:50:51,7
‚ÄúIllegal immigrants‚Äù is a loaded term that xenophobic Americans have latched onto so as to make undocumented immigrants appear threatening. I wish we would treat these people with respect and give them the opportunity to contribute to this nation‚Äôs rich tapestry of cultures.,PengJiLiuAn,2025-04-12T06:34:52,6
"I dunno.  This is one of those things that is law, but that both Parties have turned a blind eye for decades. I get that it is one thing for visitors to not register if they are simply overstaying by a month or two, as with the Canadian snowbirds or possibly migrant farm workers, but in general this will be hard for Dems, or anyone for the matter, to defend until the law or policies are changed.  Even under Obama and Biden, the U.S. has been more restrictive than Canada, Mexico, Europe, Australia, etc.... for legal immigration, visas, etc.   Every country has a right to know who crosses their borders, and who is in the country and for how long.   I believe you will find a range of responses depending on where one lands on the left-wing spectrum.  Some seem to argue for open borders while others want strict enforcement.  The issue is further complicated by illegal residents who own homes and pay taxes, and have been for years.   What the current Admin seems to be advocating for is that all illegal residents register, then leave, then attempt to seek legal admission and residency.   I am going to take a wild guess and say that anyone who attempts to go this route will have a harder time trying to come back in legally, as I can see Bondi claiming that since they were here initially illegally they should be punished. Or, the flip side is that if they don't immediately leave asap after registering, they will be picked up and deported.   You gotta ask why are they wanting to come to the U.S. in the first place, and not to say, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, etc.",crucial_geek,2025-04-12T09:12:40,1
Deporting illegal immigrants is different than locking them up in detention centers or sending them to El Salvador and left to rot. I don't support ripping families apart or taking people's green cards away because they don't fit the dynamic. They are not just locking up illegals they are targeting anyone with a dark skin tone  They have even locked up those who are legal citizens and born here. This goes so far beyond deporting illegal immigrants now. Far beyond what other presidents have done. This is brutal.  ETA there should be a way to become a legal citizen like Biden and Harris wanted but Trump destroyed that.,Ipreferthedark,2025-04-13T15:57:22,1

"Treating people humanely is something I apply to everyone. Non-citizens have a right to due process, just like any person. But mostly, it's because they are people. Them not having a right to something is different than abusing the legal tools we have to sow fear.   The republican administration is also a fascist regime actively testing the limits of it's power to abuse the rules for illegal immigration to go after people with legal status. Every additional thing like this is another tool for the administration to misuse to advance their agenda. Deportation of the father to el Salvador, revoking a student visa without notice or cause and immediately arresting the student, kidnapping students by plain cloths ice officers of full citizens whose Id was just not checked and people on valid student visas.   The driver of illegal immigration is the jobs businesses and their owners pay for. If those jobs didn't exist, illegal immigration would dry up. America got rid of migrant immigration allowances, but the need was still there and the workers just got stuck on this side of the border. One reason Americans like paying undocumented immigrants for work is that they can treat their workers worse and the workers won't complain or report it due to their status. If we are to go after someone, it should be the people paying and often exploiting immigrants. We will be catching the criminals through normal policing, right?   Finally, there are just plain logistics. That's a lot of jobs. It costs a lot of money to round up a bunch of people that aren't causing any problems and doing jobs we can't get citizens to do. It will cost even more to pay enough to convince us to work them. If we actually ended illegal immigration overnight and deported everyone, our economy would be badly damaged. We need solutions to that before we actually end it.¬†",VvvlvvV,2025-04-12T09:13:14,4
