He says he will set tariffs on Russian goods.  WE'RE NOT IMPORTING ANY RUSSION GOODS!  Not even oil.  It's all just the usual trump BS which only his colossally ignorant base will buy.,Tiny_Structure_7,2025-03-30T19:56:39,84
"I think it‚Äôs hilarious, in a dark twisted way, that Trump is finally having a harsh reality check that Putin isn‚Äôt a very nice guy. Putin isn‚Äôt interested in peace and seems to be dragging things out? No surprise there. Zelenskyy was in the Oval Office trying to explain this to you clowns weeks ago, where you ridiculed him and made us look like a bunch of jackasses on the world stage.   Zelenskyy fucking told you.",LoudCrickets72,2025-03-30T21:21:15,49

"How do we know it's naivete and not Trump's desire to help Russia and screw Ukraine?  Of course in response, one might point to recent public statements. Like Trump is saying he's angry with Putin and he's threatening to tarrif Russian oil.   Except America doesn't buy any Russian oil. Also saying such things is a pretty basic cover to pretend he's not on Russias side. Looking at actions taken are more important than words.",beekeeper1981,2025-03-30T20:35:17,10
"This isn't news. Putin's position hasn't changed in years - he wants the Russian Empire back. Out to the borders of the former USSR or the Russian Empire from 1895. In that, he's the opposite of Trump. Putin is very consistent. Trump is all over the place.",Animats,2025-03-30T22:22:20,8

"I think saying it's his ""niavete"" is in a way, giving him an out. He full on knows RXACTLY, what he's doing - and who's pulling his strings.   The point is, trump gives literally zero ahits about anyone. He even told his base during his last campaign ""I don't care about you, only your votes...""  Whattaya know, they cheered for his statement and fell right into line!  Willfully stupid people make me angry.",Jakesma1999,2025-03-31T04:24:31,1

"It's complicated.  iirc, Trump is saying that he is going to sanction countries that buy Russian oil and natural gas.  But .... Exxon, Shell, Chevron, etc. really want to tap into Russian oil.  As for being friendly with Putin, the whole 'we need to be friendly with Russia' thing goes back to the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991 and was lead by U.S. elites who saw a post Cold-War capitalism / globalism opening up in Russia.  At the time, the U.S. 1% pushed hard to turn Russia into a capitalist society.  Then, I shit you not, Bill Clinton pushed the idea of having Russia join the E.U., and possibly even NATO.  No joke.  Trump was a huge backer of the Clintons and their economic policies back in the day, so this is likely where his current ideas are stemming from.  But then Putin happened and starts cracking down on Russia's brief filtration with democracy and that was that.  Up until Crimea in 2014, and the 2016 election meddling, the U.S. elites continued to push, and do, business with Russia. Make no mistake about it, Trump still really wants to build his hotel in Moscow.  Probably.a few golf courses, too.  But ... on the other hand Russia is not known for their environmental protections and it is suspected that a good chunk of their natural resources contain radioactive contamination from spills, tests, poor waste management techniques, uranium mining without environmental concern, etc.  But, this is also due to aging infrastructure which is why they really want western tech. Despite Chernobyl, Ukraine is far 'cleaner' despite having Soviet era environmental baggage.  So despite Russia being a gold mine of economic possibilities, Russia essentially also has no long-term growth possibilities unless Putin changes course with domestic policies.  On the other hand, from the U.S. perspective, Ukraine is the better long-term gold mine.  But, Trump is transactional and is a businessman first, second, and last who is all about the deal, period.  He is known to reverse course in the past, and my guess is that it is not so much about his views on Putin changing, but instead the possible realizing that Ukraine is the better financial deal.  Keep in mind that he does receive intelligence briefings.  The other thing is that the U.S. wants to focus attention on China and to do that Russia needs to be out of the way as far as threats are concerned.  We can point fingers towards loyalties and whatnot, but geopolitics are fucking complicated and never simply black or white.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T10:45:15,2
