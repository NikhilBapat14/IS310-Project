People should be allowed to buy whatever they want. But they shouldn't have the tax payers subsidies it. Nor should terrorist be allowed to stop them.,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-09T14:31:05,80
"I’ll take an electric car when it’s actually a superior experience and isn’t a platform that’s controlled by some centralized AI-powered car platform where everything is an add-on nonsense.  Quality. Reliability. Durability. Value.  Right now they seem way overpriced, don’t work well in the cold, don’t charge quickly, have the same or worse range as my gas vehicle, can’t tow for a damn, and depreciate faster than an elephant in atmospheric freefall.  That said, I’m watching the industry commit suicide with their diesel emissions control systems, the bad quality of modern vehicles is out of control, and the prices are actually hilarious.  I feel like they took all their ice vehicles and value optimized the hell out of them to try to squeeze as much money out of them as possible in parts and repairs as they transitioned (which btw is exactly what’s happening, they call them legacy in their 10 quarterlies) to this supposedly new system of smart car platforms.  Look at this dumbass vision:  https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/13/smart-cars-smarter-journeys-a-new-perspective-on-the-modern-vehicle/  They want to turn your car into your wallet, your home away from home, and all this absolutely MBA-lead nonsense that is so disconnected from what the average driver wants it’s insane.  They want to make every car a “sophisticated computer” and *I* and *many others like me* DO NOT want this. Of all the things I need in my life, an overpriced, disposable, unrepairable dumpster fire of a vehicle that tries to be Apple Pay every time I turn around is the last thing.  I’m SO HAPPY every time I read about the failure of the so called “electric pivot” in automotive, because it was never about electric it was about yet another industry that wants enshitification so they can optimize revenue instead of providing good old fashion value — our culture needs to get back to a square deal and a fair buck and get these idiots who think extraction of every last penny on a monthly lease is the right direction.",Blarghnog,2025-05-09T14:50:07,72
"Good. Why are we offering incentives and tax breaks for EV cars in the first place.  I feel for the workers in the factories, they will feel the pinch. Corporate wont.   The country is far enough in debt we need to allow companies that can’t compete the ability to fail because the market dictates what they sell is shit.  My grandpa was an auto mechanic, owned his own business. Did some buy here pay here stuff with used cars. Cash for klunkers back in 2008 killed his business. Took all the old cars off the road, were traded in for something new , and then crushed.  Those parts could have kept a generation of cars on the road and countless small businesses operating. But they didn’t do anything but crush them and who knows what happened to the steel after that.   The cars that replaced them have been plastic shit. Let ford fail and the politicians on their payroll can follow behind.",MapleMonstera,2025-05-09T17:50:50,13

"I made one of my liberal coworkers speechless the other day. He was talking about Trump tanking the stock market. Then I asked him, why go after Tesla drivers and Tesla? Why purposefully try to tank their stock knowing that it is in millions of people's retirement portfolios? You're not hurting Elon. You're hurting the public and American citizens. I said, imagine a single mom that can't afford a $500 deductible to fix graffiti on her Tesla??? crickets lol.......",BossJackson222,2025-05-09T17:31:19,1

"Beyond the general crappiness and pointless feature bloat of all new cars...  I can refill my ICE vehicle in 2 minutes, max. From empty to full. It takes an EV 20-30 minutes to charge 80%? Assuming the charging even works or hasn't been gutted by copper thieves?  My ICE vehicle doesn't need hyperconnectivity to function and there's no actual, realistic, grounded, plausible, or honest reason why an EV needs it either. I don't want my vehicle turning into brick because because the intern spilled his coffee on the ""turn cars into bricks"" control panel or the car permissions guy decided my social media meme dump was offensive, or more realistically, because their software update does what software updates are known for: taking a thing that works, and then making it not work.  Ditto with an app. I don't really care if you offer an app to go with the vehicle, but if I *need* the app to make your vehicle function then I'm not buying your vehicle. I'll build one from scrap metal (and paint it red and MOAR DAKKA!) and junkyard Frankenstein stuff.   And EVs are heavy for their size.",Alpha-Sierra-Charlie,2025-05-09T23:01:33,1
When they widened EV tax credits so companies like Ford could sell cars that qualify - within something like a week Ford increased the price of the Mach-E the exact same amount as the tax credits.  As did many others.  This happens a **lot** with tax credits.,cliffotn,2025-05-09T16:37:41,36
"You’re 100% spot on with the enshittification problem except that this applies to every modern vehicle, more or less, not just EVs. Take Chevy getting caught selling your driving data to brokers who used it to determine your insurance rates, disabling Apple CarPlay so they can sell more of your data, BMW upselling a subscription service for heated seats. Ford is arguably the least bad of the bunch and I will *never* buy a GM again after that nonsense they pulled.  Other than towing capacity and shady behavior by some charging station operators, which is less of a problem if you charge at home, EVs have their place. We just need to be honest about their drawbacks and those of every modern vehicle.",zip117,2025-05-09T15:01:56,25

"I love my battery-powered nonsense. Tell me why I shouldn’t. My Mach-E is fast as hell, virtually maintenance-free and costs basically nothing to charge at home.  I could do without subsidies but why shouldn’t we want an American company to succeed and help make us energy independent?",zip117,2025-05-09T14:49:49,39
They make sense under certain circumstances. However the F150 lightning is a god damn joke. People getting 200 miles on a single charge with just a single passenger doing 70 and ac is absurd.  also it's sub 100 with AC off under load.,Creski,2025-05-09T14:37:55,15

>It takes an EV 20-30 minutes to charge 80%?  If they are lucky... The new Hummer EV took an hour and fifteen minutes just to get to 60%.... It would have taken another 2 hours to charge to full,Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-10T00:06:09,1
"Residential solar is the worst of all, and consumers are actually ending up worse off because the tax credits go to fintech lenders who take advantage of people and convince them to sign 20 year loan agreements under false pretenses.  Most of these “green energy” tax credits are a conduit for scams. And I’m saying that as an EV owner.",zip117,2025-05-09T18:46:57,8
