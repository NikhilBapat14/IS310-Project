Sounds like a weak leader. Makes poor decisions and has to be reined in by his incompetent subordinates.,Jolly-Consequences,2025-04-23T09:50:28,8

"President Donald Trump’s [abrupt shift in rhetoric Tuesday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/22/trump-fed-powell/) toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell reflected the private lobbying of some of his senior advisers, who had urged the president to back off his incendiary attacks on the central bank, three people familiar with the matter said.  On Monday, the stock market fell precipitously as Trump attacked Powell as a “major loser,” fueling speculation that the president would move to fire the Fed chief. But by Tuesday afternoon, Trump appeared to dial back his rhetoric, saying he had “no intention of firing” Powell and arguing that the “press runs away with things.”  Stock futures jumped overnight, and markets surged Wednesday as trading opened.  The president’s shift followed the counsel of several administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations. Officials argued to the president that the administration did not need further disruption in financial markets from an all-out battle with the Federal Reserve, and that it already had several major economic fights on its hands, including trade disputes and new tariffs, the people said. The slide in stocks made Trump more open to leaving Powell in his position than he would have been a month ago, one of the people said.

I’m surprised Trump and congress etc aren’t getting more insider trading complaints which can be easily filed at https://www.sec.gov/submit-tip-or-complaint. Just sayin.,myasslovesgrass,2025-04-23T10:43:46,1

"Capitalism is a really stupid economic system. There are aspects of it that work sometimes, and there are aspects that make no sense. The market is largely controlled by like 2-3 super computers at this point. The prices aren't reflective of value. It's a feelings based economy. The only people who benefit from this are the extremely wealthy.",MittenCollyBulbasaur,2025-04-23T12:32:48,4
It baffles me that so many low and middle income people are willing to gamble their money. It's obvious that the rich and well connected are skimming the profit. Wake up people.,Other-Net-3262,2025-04-23T12:50:28,2
I gave your comment an upvote because I felt like it's contributing to the conversation but if you ever want to be baffled in this context check out a casino on a weekday. Low and middle income people are willing to gamble their money away in exchange for flashing lights. We're really really stupid people lol,MittenCollyBulbasaur,2025-04-23T14:57:24,1
