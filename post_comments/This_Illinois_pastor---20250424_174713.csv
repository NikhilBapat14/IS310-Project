Pastorbro trying to drum up publicity,vegatx40,2025-04-24T19:46:54,49
Has there been any historical depictions of Jesus covered in gang tattoos?,KinGpiNdaGreat,2025-04-24T18:07:41,72
This is the faction of the Methodist church us conservative members were more than happy to part with. Go your own way blasphemers.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-24T18:31:22,34
"I’m pretty sure he was well documented. Between heavenly messengers announcing his arrival, the wise men traveling to see him, and the fact that they were in Bethlehem to pay taxes as citizens, I’m not sure where this fruitcake is coming from.",dottedoctet,2025-04-24T20:01:59,40
I would have walked out.,caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-24T18:23:43,44
">If Jesus came today in flesh and blood, would we even let him in? Would we let him cross our borders?   Uh oh... Somebody's been watching too many ""He Gets Us"" commercials.",Farmwife64,2025-04-24T18:57:04,38
"Yeshua is not undocumented. The Illinois pastor is using his imagination!  Matthew 17:25-26  And he said to them, “Yes.” And when Kaypha entered the house, Yeshua anticipated him and he said to him, “How does it seem to you Shimeon? From whom do the Kings of the earth take taxes and head money? From their children or from strangers?”  And Shimeon said to him, “From strangers.” Then Yeshua said to him, “Then the children are free.”",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T17:50:20,16
"Was Jesus illegally in the USA... no comparison what so ever at all, but hey, let them run with it",Wide_Fig3130,2025-04-24T20:58:20,5
These comparisons to Our Lord and Savior are not even close.,Crisgocentipede,2025-04-25T01:05:33,2
Let's accept this pastor's absurdism for a moment - In which book did the State offer acceptance and house an illegal immigrant instead of a private landholder who gave out his stable for them to use?,deciduousredcoat,2025-04-24T18:23:40,5
"I stopped attending organized religion specifically Catholic ones when they took up a second collection to pave the parking lot in the late 80s.  It's a business guys.  A tax free one.  They will pander like olstesn to get Grandmas cash.  It is FREE to believe in whatever you see or helps you from jumping into a bath with a toaster, remember that.",scram007-3,2025-04-24T18:48:19,3
Pastor repeating something that has often been disproved... sounds like a great guy.,SonnyC_50,2025-04-25T08:29:22,1
These pastors want to use the American Taxpayer as an ATM for whomever they choose.,truth-4-sale,2025-04-25T11:26:40,1
"How about wife beating or human trafficking? Not only this, Yeshua was not undocumented!  But Yoseph had come up from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, to Judea to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was from the house and from the lineage of David,  With Maryam his bride when she was pregnant, that he might be registered there.  Luke 2:4-5   Yeshua was not undocumented!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-24T18:11:00,79
Yes. It’s well known that he was heavily involved with ms13(messiah savior 13),Open-Chain-7137,2025-04-25T16:30:51,3
Yup! @ dottedoctet!,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-25T00:43:48,2
What are with those commercials?? I get such an ookie vibe any time one comes on. Who is funding/supporting them and why? ,ohmysweetwesley,2025-04-25T09:44:41,2
"A common tactic of the left is to imagine what Jesus they need to make an argument against others, even though they don't believe in Jesus.",QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-24T23:47:13,7
"The thing is, Jesus wasn't illegally anywhere at any time. As a child His parents took Him from Judea (part of the Roman Empire) to Egypt (also part of the Roman Empire) to flee a significant, direct threat against His life. King Herod wanted Jesus dead. He wanted Jesus dead so much that he ordered the deaths of all male children in the area who were two years and younger.  *Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men*. - Matthew 2:17  Joseph and Mary broke no laws when they fled to Egypt with Jesus. And when the threat was over, they went back home to Judea.",Farmwife64,2025-04-25T06:23:49,6
Sounds like 'Palestinians' are illegally in Israeli land.,QuietRedditorATX,2025-04-24T23:48:12,3
Some. Mega churches for sure. My small country church not so much.,wv_lookin_around,2025-04-24T19:13:51,8
"Isn't that the kicker? They all were in Bethlehem, precisely for the census. Can't get any more documented than being born during the census",sowellpatrol,2025-04-24T22:40:07,31
"I'm not entirely sure who is funding them. Their goal seems to be to share Jesus's message of love. My concern is whose definition of love are they're using...the world's or God's? The two are not the same.  The world loves people by telling them what they WANT to hear.  Jesus loved people by telling them what they NEEDED to hear, The Truth. And we Christians are called to do the same. While I haven't seen all their commercials, the ones I have seen fall short of that, IMO.  I'm all for sharing Jesus with the world, but we must share ALL of Him, not just the parts people like. Jesus showed beautiful compassion to the woman caught in adultery. But He also told her to go and sin no more....we cannot miss that part.",Farmwife64,2025-04-25T10:29:14,4
"I totally agree, it feels like a very insincere attempt to represent Jesus. However, if it does lead even one person to seeking Him then I am for it! Just feels like it could have been done in a more ""real"" way? I dunno, maybe I'm being too much of a gatekeeper",ohmysweetwesley,2025-04-25T11:51:59,3
">... if it does lead even one person to seeking Him then I am for it!  I get that. Lots of people feel this way.  I always think of the phrase ""What you win someone with you win them to."" If someone is seeking the nice, accommodating Jesus that always tells them what they want to hear, it's unlikely they'll ever recognize the real Jesus that is calling them to repentance. But it certainly could happen. I can tell you from experience that God can be very persuasive ;)",Farmwife64,2025-04-25T12:20:24,1
