If this isn’t ethnic cleansing then what is?,jimmygee2,2025-05-05T22:52:02,21
"In 1977 Likud, Netanyahu's party, made it a core party plank that all lands and properties between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea are Israel, and nobody else. It explains why Israel has never ceded an inch of any of the land and homes they've seized from Palestinians back to them, and why there will never be a Palestinian state. The goal is the complete eradication of even the idea of a Palestinian homeland, and after they succeed the word ""Palestine"" will only exist in history books and no Palestinian will ever have a homeland to return to.",noncongruent,2025-05-05T22:46:52,17
"The official conquest has begun. This is the beginning of the end of the Palestinian people, and it will be remembered as yet another atrocity that will never be properly punished. Alas, we live in a world where evil often wins.",LordSiravant,2025-05-05T23:07:44,12

Fascism. This is what this is. I'm sick of people defending these assholes. This has NOTHING to do with the Holocaust or antisemitism ,Smart_Recipe_8223,2025-05-07T08:38:11,1
"But at least the Dems learned a lesson, right guys? Thank *God* we have so many heroes in the US willing to sit on their asses and teach people lessons. This total eradication of the Palestinian people would never have been possible without their assistance.",StoppableHulk,2025-05-06T00:22:06,1
