"our system isn't all it's cracked up to be, most people understand that. still, the assertion that ""any random, non-elected (foreign) civilian"" has ""the ability to go in and gut the entire government with zero oversight"" is nonetheless an oversimplification at best.  first of all, the president has not gutted the entire government. he has done everything he can do within the confines of the constitution to remove what he sees as inefficiency. i'll give the most notable example: the department of education. he has signed an order essentially supporting its abolition and the secretary he appointed (who was confirmed by congress) announced that the department would fire half its staff. it is not, however, abolished, as this requires an act of congress. it's been harmed, yes, but it is still in existence.  second of all, yes, it is perfectly legal for the president to be advised by whomever he pleases (see [senior advisor to the president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States)). contrary to most reporting, musk is not the one exercising the power to ""gut the entire government."" his position is given the responsibility of identifying ""inefficiency"" and advising the president on how to eliminate it. in practice, musk has acted with considerable autonomy, but ultimately he has done so with the support of the president, under whose authority the things he is recommending are executed. furthermore, musk or no musk, trump and his allies likely would have done these things on their own.  to answer your question succinctly, yes, all of the things you have brought up have, thus far, been legal. trump has done some more legally-questionable things, particularly relating to the deportation of an american citizen, however, yes our constitution really *does* permit the president to be advised by whomever he wants, and it really *does* allow him to mess around with executive agencies",Financial-Bat-8850,2025-05-01T16:54:26,1
