"The one irony here is that arts endowments often prop up opera, ballet, symphony orchestras, classical ""Western"" arts that some conservatives love to extol. It's stuff wealthy people love to say they patronize, but isn't economically viable without government grants. So there's a little bit of Leopards Ate My Face here for a certain type of conservative.  So the classical Western type culture/arts gets defunded, that's bad for the performers but what's going to fill that gap? Maybe stuff young people actually like, like stuff influenced by gaming and Japanese pop culture? Keep in mind without those endowments these same institutions will need to turn more towards things that actually sell tickets, so it's highly possible that instead of some classical thing, they do symphonic chiptunes renditions from the Final Fantasy series.",cipheron,2025-05-04T18:25:50,10

"You know who else targeted, and destroyed the arts? Nazis. Hyper control personal and artistic expression, force alignment to nationalist beliefs, control the world… Trump, MAGA, and the GOP are Nazis.",icecreemsamwich,2025-05-05T00:46:10,2

Advanced civilizations throughout history supported its arts. This means we have jumped the shark and are collapsing like the Romans.,JamesepicYT,2025-05-04T18:28:13,7

"Federal arts funding almost all goes to stuff almost nobody wants to see, because they were the popular arts 300 years ago, and only really popular with wealthy elites now to make them feel special and better than everyone else.  If normal people are interested in an art it probably gets near zero funding and you have to do it yourself. Those ones are more likely to get local funding: anything good I've seen where I live almost exclusively gets funded by local councils, supported by the local city library etc, not the kind of thing they'd spend federal dollars on.",cipheron,2025-05-04T18:58:06,-6
