"So Trump finally admits openly defying the Supreme Court? Any other president and they'd be impeached and removed for subverting the Constitution, but since it's a 34 time felon and sexual abuser doing it, it's totally fine. The supposed party of family values hitched themselves to a guy who couldn't even name a favorite Bible verse when asked.",IpeeEhh_Phanatic,2025-04-29T23:21:46,136

"It's an amazing super power this piece of shit has, openly admitting to crimes in broad daylight, on TV, and never facing consequences. The god damn pedophile is right here admitting to disregarding the supreme court and proving the validity of his administration being held in contempt, but ya know, force field because it was said on TV.",J-the-Kidder,2025-04-30T04:12:22,9
"We already knew this...  > President Trump... said he does have the ability to help return the wrongly deported Maryland man, but is not willing to do so because he believes he is a gang member.  > “You could get him back, there’s a phone on this desk,” said Terry Moran, an ABC News correspondent, noting a Supreme Court order to “facilitate” the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia.  > “I could,” Mr. Trump replied.  Yea, you *could* abide by the multiple court rulings that have ordered Garcia's return, or the court orders that have determined your actions unconstitutional. You *could* listen to a majority of the American public who disagree with the way you've handled this fiasco. You *could* stop spreading lies and misinformation. You *could* stop threatening judges and overstepping your authority.   You *could* stop using inflammatory rhetoric to rationalize your administration's unlawful actions. You *could* stop throwing people into unmarked vehicles or unlawfully detaining and deporting legal residents, children and U.S. citizens. You *could* stop using non-gang affiliated tattoos and clothing as grounds for deportation.   You *could* stop stripping people of their rights while  shipping alleged ""gang members"" with no criminal records to Guantanamo bay and abroad to one of the most dangerous prisons on earth.  You *could* stop defying court orders and invoking archaic laws to pursue the deliberate mistreatment of ""undesirables."" You *could* stop unconstitutionally profiling and targeting visa holders, asylum seekers, green card carriers, foreign students, protestors, U.S. residents and migrants protected from deportation, especially those critical of your administration's policies and those who you've so presciently mischaracterized as ""criminals"" because they either fit a convenient stereotype or don't subscribe to your cult's philosophy...  You *could* and *should* do these things, but you won't because you obviously care about these people just as much as you care about the constitution and the rule of law...",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-29T23:35:30,12

"I get that the Abrego Garcia case is important, since even the Supreme Court said he has to facilitate the return of him. But why is the news not talking about the 100s of others that have been sent to CECOT? That's really the bigger story. It's not one man not convicted of a crime being sent there. It's the 100s.",mces97,2025-04-30T00:07:20,4
