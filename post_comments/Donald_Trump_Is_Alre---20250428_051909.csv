Donald Trump is a terrorist. His goal is to destroy our country as a retribution.  He must be removed from office ASAP if we want to save our country.,reddittorbrigade,2025-04-28T05:42:30,16

"As much as he's done to damage everything else, he's utterly defiled the core of Christianity - twisting every single message from Christ about peace and love and truth into a frenzy for retribution, cruelty, and exclusion.  From all I can see and hear, Omnipotent Orange is gradually checking off the known characteristics of demonic possession - and a huge number of so-called ""Christians"" are enthusiastically supporting his efforts to finish off the list.",phosdick,2025-04-28T06:46:01,3

"Just saying, it's fucked up of humanity to have the idea Christmas is ""ruined"" because mindlessly consuming brand new products is too expensive now when the planet is overflowing with perfectly good used products.   Buy less, and only buy secondhand.  I hate tRump as much as the next guy, but the fewer people buying new products, the better.  It really isn't the end of the world to have no choice but to consume LESS, for god's sake.",GhostfogDragon,2025-04-28T11:01:46,3
"Trump is a misfit, a disruptor, all to satisfy his attention addiction.  He lives in a narcissistic world of make-believe where he is the smart one.  Yes, not only is he ruining Christmas, but he will be making daily life worse in many ways.",Smithy2232,2025-04-28T05:26:20,4

"We're fighting against the PRC, communism and for our national interests. The actual part of MAGA that is what MAGA is rooted in. Everybody wants a return to a 1950s-1960s society and economic distribution. This is how the USA gets there. If the USA has to sacrifice to get there, so be it.",Chuck-Finley69,2025-04-28T06:13:18,-36

"This makes a ton of sense !   If you have no concept of how anything actually works outside of your television, or are just highly uneducated.  Holy fuck. Stop making us all sound so fucking stupid. You actually said communism ffs lmao.   Edit: 1950's society ? So you want racism and to own women. Gotcha...",ItsPhayded420,2025-04-28T07:59:20,20

"Thank you for proving my point.  Jesus fucking Christ bro.  You somehow made a dumber and less educated statement than your last... How ?  I wish things were as simple as you man, it sounds nice to be blissful. You should really learn how companies make their profit and how economies work in general though.

"No. I just sold my country out for globalism 30+ years ago then realized we fucked over the younger generation. The debt load and trade imbalance has been unsustainable for a long time. Had we done this 15-20 years ago, such as the Great Recession, it wouldn't be as painful.  For the USA to achieve it's former standard of living, we have to go back and use our consumer strength to build our wealth back. We all can't share the wealth. Literally, we lowered our standard of living helping others. We need to worry about ourselves just like we used and how the PRC does now.",Chuck-Finley69,2025-04-28T14:40:09,0
"It's blatantly obvious you know very little about what you're saying and only know buzz words. I'm not about a give a grown ass man a middle school education on reddit for fucks sake.  If you think we Americans are struggling and scraping by simply because of ""globalism"" even though you seem to vaguely understand the term, or that we actually put other countries interests above our own you are a genuine moron. Our standard of living is great, the cost is not. Hindsight is just that, you can't go back. You fucked up the first time, and you're fucking up now.  Also read a fucking history book.",ItsPhayded420,2025-04-28T16:47:22,5
