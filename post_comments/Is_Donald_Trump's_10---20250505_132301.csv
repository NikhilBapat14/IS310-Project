Not legally but this Regime has shown nothing but contempt for the law.,ZillaSlayer54,2025-05-05T13:28:14,14
"Everything is possible if you put your mind to it. Since this is Trump, no.",KidKilobyte,2025-05-05T13:31:05,3
"Cloud and streaming companies are considered tariff-proof by most Wall Street types. Movies would seem to be in a similar situation. Is Lord of the Rings a New Zealand production, where much of it was filmed, or California, where all the post production happened?",ranchoparksteve,2025-05-05T13:28:19,5
He’s just talking out of his ask most of the time. Like if Abe Simpson and Mr. Burns had a baby golem.,declinedinaction,2025-05-05T13:30:38,2
"Just said it it another post, I guess I’ll send the external revenue service $1 every time I stream something that’s not “American”.  I guess I just need their Venmo.",drfishdaddy,2025-05-05T13:33:50,2

"Anything is possible with this administration.  Pigs can't fly? Trump ""Let me get my catapult. Pigs may die, but who doesn't love bacon."" The horrible part is I can honestly see him doing and saying this.  ",arilupe,2025-05-05T14:20:51,1
"This may be the first thing that gets Americans off their collective asses: Trump just made your next Marvel movie prohibitively expensive to watch.  (Since they seem to be mostly fine with kids in cages, fraud and his particular brand of constitutional bukkake.)",SniffyTheBee,2025-05-05T16:31:00,1
Remember when he deported a person to El Salvador illegally.,Notoneusernameleft,2025-05-05T21:08:04,1
"Eh, this isn't something the administration can ignore the courts on, as they need the courts for enforcement. If a studio or streaming service refuses to pay the duty and they have the court rulings on their side, the admin is pretty much shit out of luck. Going heavy handed against rich corporations, when those corps have the courts in their side, is beyond what Trump can get away with.",DocQuanta,2025-05-05T13:45:19,3
Nuance? 145% tariff for asking hard questions!,TheDebateMatters,2025-05-05T13:39:30,7
"All post production took place in Wellington, NZ.",finndego,2025-05-05T14:26:20,2
"Theoretically you could have an international firewall and tax the raw footage being sent over the internet from New Zealand the way auto parts are taxed from Canada. It'd be a huge mess, but that never stopped Trump. ",JesterOfEmptiness,2025-05-05T13:50:24,1
