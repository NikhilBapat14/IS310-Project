"Just so people are aware…. This is not just the fund that gets narcan into the hands of first responders. It’s the one that gets pain patients free doses with their prescriptions, and also allows hospitals to give out doses to “frequent flyers” or anyone who asks for it in the ER. The simple act of handing out free narcan at my own ER has probably saved more lives than I actually have in my career.

"I keep 2 narcan in my car because sometimes people come into contact with it by accident. Plenty of police have been exposed by it by accident or by not following basic training. Plenty of users have been saved and given another chance at life because of narcan. The basics of this grant are to give out narcan free or easily have more out reaching benefits than the cost itself. It helps save lives, by user and first responder alike. To end the grant will ensure more lives will be lost, but they are betting it's only drug users that will die. They will be disappointed eventually knowing other bystanders will die because of the negligent oversight of ending this.
