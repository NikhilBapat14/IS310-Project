"For decades several million workers crossed the southern border for each planting and harvest season, earned enough to live on for a year, and went back home at the end of the work. Then jrbush ""closed"" the border while those folks were on the job, so they stayed and set about bringing their families to join them. As a group, these folks are less likely to run afoul of the legal system than the average native born American (except for their technical crime of having no papers).  The number has been declining and is now stabilized at about 10.5M. Without immigrants, the US population would've been declining for several years. The fact is, without undocumented workers, a great many jobs would go vacant as no natural born America would take them at the wages being offered.  Any American who lost a job to an undocumented immigrant may want to consider  getting some additional skills or working harder. Any high-end worker who lost a job to an immigrant with a visa might want to consider voting for people who would reduce the number of visas being issued.",Olderscout77,2024-05-31T07:33:57,57

Net illegal crossings would have continued to decline, had Trump continued the Obama administration policies (i.e., done nothing), but instead, he opted for multiple policies that DHS recommended against, in preparation for a $17 billion dollar border wall scam that DHS also said would be basically worthless. The Trump administration created a backlog of amnesty cases that ended up crippling immigration courts, and ultimately leading to a spike in illegal entries. Because of the increased border scrutiny, it became much safer to simply keep sending money back home than returning home after several years of working in the US (the system that was working under Obama).
