The fifth one's hardly a concession with all of the other things the Republicans have done to women and mothers in that terrible state. Like throwing a bone at a dog with pure disinterest.,ComplaintKindly5377,2025-04-06T14:45:05,3

"I have a cynical way of looking at this.  Why are democrats doing ANYTHING good that the MAGA repubs will take credit for anyway?  They have little to no control over the govt right now and very apparent that MAGA has the reigns.  If things go to shit, which they are on that way, then they can blame MAGA just like how they blamed dems for four years.",raybrignsx,2025-04-06T20:51:47,1

"Meanwhile‚Ä¶ republicans enshrined voter ID into Wisconsin state law‚Ä¶  Gotta make it as hard to vote as possible, right?  Maybe because of that, the cost and process to get an ID can be eliminated? No-cost ID, and make it as seamless as possible to get one.",DanTheMan827,2025-04-07T11:41:01,1
"Just two weeks ago people were complaining that the Democrats ""weren't doing anything"". Listen I'm as critical of the Dems more so than the average American, and there are plenty of pink slips to hand in the party, but often you have to play to your outs.  Best thing the Dems could do in the short term is lawyer the fuck up, strike down the shittiest EOs, and let the Trump train crash on its own. Aside from that, it's letting the democratic process proceed.",I_Hate_Taylor_Swift_,2025-04-07T12:48:43,1
"Keep in mind that something like ‚ÄúHouse Democrats passed‚Äù could simply mean ‚ÄúHouse Democrats voted within their caucus and agreed‚Äù which is nothing. It doesn‚Äôt mean that the House passed anything, let alone the full Congress.",userlivewire,2025-04-07T13:06:22,1
"I'm happy about things getting done but also feels like it's too little, too late. Where was this energy before ""patriotic"" Americans re-elected a fascist? People have been losing faith in the Democratic party but they kept running on the panel of just empathizing with the hardship of Americans instead of doing anything about it, and NOW the politicians we elected are taking action? Imagine if they tried doing these things when we had any amount of leverage in the government...   I'll reserve my applause.",N3oneclipse,2025-04-08T12:04:29,1

Democrats couldn‚Äôt get Trump not elected. How incapable do you have to be to achieve that?,GatorNator83,2025-04-06T16:19:42,-11
"As my great grandmother once said, ‚ÄúNow is not the time to panic, there‚Äôs plenty of time for that later.‚Äù I think we‚Äôve done a great job of staying calm, and planning for the future. We‚Äôve already achieved several victories since our loss in the 2024 presidential election. With Trump and his incompetent administration, we should be able to do well in the governor elections this year, as well as the midterms that are coming up.  Musk may be able to funnel millions into these elections, but as Wisconsin voters proved, we can get past his corruption and elect people who truly represent our best interests.  If I was going to give an optimistic, but realistic answer, I fully believe that democrats will win a very comfy majority in the house, and a slim majority in the senate, however it‚Äôs not entirely unrealistic that democrats could pick up more seats as well.  In the end, we have a very strong reason to get out and vote, while republican voters might not have that same energy as they did when they were voting for Trump. I fully believe that as long as we carry this same energy to 2026, and potentially 2028, we can get our glorious nation back on the path to prosperity.",CactusSpirit78,2025-04-06T16:53:34,18

Not even that. Leading from anywhere would be nice. The only thing I saw the congressional dems do was to waive the flag during state of the union.   Grass roots are leading. Congressional dems are sitting back saying we are powerless.,cyokohama,2025-04-06T22:36:21,2

I don't even know why NC is still deemed a swing state. It went red for the past four presidential elections and the Supreme Court bullshit that is happening there just proves it's only getting redder.,JustAnotherFag69,2025-04-06T17:14:09,2
