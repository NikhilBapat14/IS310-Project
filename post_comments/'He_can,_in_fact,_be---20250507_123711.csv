"The problem with M4A or some other kind of single payer system it that it does make every kind right wing Republican attack against the ACA true.  Yes you might have more overall doctors but some doctors are better than others or get more referrals from doctors. If you have been seeing a doctor for years who now suddenly gets 10x the demand and you now have to wait months when before you could see him easily how is that not losing your doctor? Or say the doctor now won't accept the negotiating price of care and decides to retire. It isn't an issue of less choice it is that healthcare is a very personal medicine. Pointing to ""well now you can choose among more doctors than before"" doesn't change the view of someone who now can't see their doctor from their point of view.  Another issue is when Republicans fear mongered about death panels. I wouldn't call them that but under a M4A system the government will be deciding if it is going to pay for an expensive life saving surgery that has like a 10% success rate as an example. Of course private insurance does that all the time too but they are already an easy villian for obvious reasons. That is the government doing a process where it will choose whether or not it will spend money to try and save someone's life.   The issue is I haven't talked to a single single payer supporter who has grappled with these real issues and just dismisses them as you do as being against universal healthcare.  No what Pete and many Democrats like myself support is a public option Medicare for those who want it, whatever you want to call it. Not only do I think in a country as large as the US a one size fits all solution wouldn't work as well as one with more players it really is about achieving universal healthcare with the least disruption in people's lives.

"I’m sorry but there was simply not that much care and nuance put into it. It’s fine to have an intelligent argument about why another approach to healthcare is necessary, but that was certainly not what was being said during that election cycle. They simply stated you’d have less choice. I wouldn’t have just gone years without hearing about these criticisms if all the naysayers actually said anything other than “you’ll lose your choice.” I’m not sure how someone can say, in a vacuum, that that’s not just a simply false statement. Hence my disappointment.   But all that aside, that drastic increase in demand just doesn’t sound like a realistic concern. Are people moving across the country to seek out your doctor? 10x demand sounds like hyperbole for the sake of the argument. I can see where you’re coming from but I don’t think in practice it’d be a real issue. Btw I’m in Florida, where everyone already has the same plan (Medicare) and the doctors are already always booked months in advance. But if you need something immediate and not routine, it’s still easy to get in when you need to. You’ll just often see a PA instead of the doctor.   In case it wasn’t obvious, I want to explicitly state again I think you’ve made some valid points.

"Meanwhile your genocide continues unabated and US power to affect change in the future is now less effective and will most likely be absorbed in rebuilding domestically rather than meddling in international affairs. Really helped out, didn’t you?  And it’s funny, but from what I’ve seen the lesson is the Democrats can’t win without young white men, as they’re a demographic that traditionally voted Democrat but broke for Trump last election. Seems like the Dems run an old white guy and shift the platform to address their concerns and the Dems can win.

"> (looking at you Bernie)  All I've seen (admittedly mostly here on reddit, anecdotal experience warning) is people salty about exactly this notion (true or not) and people blaming those people for Hillary (and amusingly, but rarely, Harris) losing rather than considering how to encourage those people to vote anyway.  As I said in my previous comment: it doesn't need to be true for people to feel disenfranchised.  I want to see efforts to reach those people and convince them to vote even if/when they feel their preferred primary candidate lost the primary.  Instead I feel like all I see is shaming, guilting, fear-mongering...fwiw there was (obviously) a *lot* to fear in Trump winning, both times, but also obvious is that a lot of people heard ""vote *against* Trump"" rather than ""vote *for* Hillary/Harris"" and it wasn't sufficiently motivating.",Tom2Die,2025-05-07T21:40:55,1

Yeah, no fucking shit people stopped bothering to try after that.  Dems wanted to deflate the enthusiasm of the Sanders campaign... they succeeded.  Now we are at a crossroads where the pro-genocide part of the party is calling the shots.  Don't expect people on the left to do the dirty work for you to change that, we are a minority in the party. It's on liberal Democrats to finally fix the shit they have helped happen.  Because you can mark my words, if they don't change course on Israel, you can expect even lower turnout for Dems in 2028.

"You seem to be arguing two contradictory things here -- one, the left owns this genocide because they didn't vote Dem. And yet, according to you, it wasn't the anti-genocide left that caused Dems to lose -- it was right-leaning young white men who could be won back by Dems moving right.   So it was centrist Dems who were in power during the start of the genocide (when the vast majority of Palestinians were killed), and right-leaning young white men responsible for those killed since. So according to your own logic those who refused to vote Dem in 2024 are faultless when it comes to Israel's genocide.",nonamey_namerson,2025-05-08T10:53:52,1

"McKinsey publicly released him from their NDA which allowed him to say his client list.  That doesn’t mean any of his clients released him from their NDAs. It’s basically impossible he wasn’t under one when he did work for any of the clients on that list.  It’s a standard for almost any strategy consulting project. The government ones most likely required a clearance as well.  Like I said earlier, you really should try to learn the basics of an industry before believing you know anything about what he could have done where.  It’s also extremely unprofessional to discuss strategy work publicly even because it’s basically always under some form of information control like an NDA. They’re standard fare when working with the type of data needed to do that work.  The fact that you hadn’t even considered one when it is essentially required for strategy work means you really shouldn’t be weighing in with assumptions about what he could have done.  He was also an associate. Even if the engagement manager used his work (and the other associates’ work) to recommend layoffs, Pete’s work wouldn’t have been to give the recommendations for anything officially to the client.  Associates basically just crunch numbers, make slides and ensure their small piece of the bigger picture is known. They aren’t leading engagements or even promoting specific ideas to clients.  At McKinsey, associates are essentially post MBA entry level positions. They don’t even present deliverables to clients.",mightcommentsometime,2025-05-08T17:12:09,1
