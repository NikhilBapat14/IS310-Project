"From the article: *""Hegseth does his own makeup, according to the defense official.""*     It must be that new ""warrior ethos"" he kept talking about.",CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-26T10:04:48,74

"whats a green room?  > A green room is a space in a theater, studio, or similar venue where performers or guests wait before or after their appearance. It’s typically a lounge area for relaxing, preparing, or socializing, often equipped with seating, mirrors, and refreshments. The term’s origin is unclear, but it may relate to early theaters using green-painted rooms or green fabric to reduce eye strain under bright stage lights. It’s not always literally green.",Just_Cruzen,2025-04-26T10:06:52,2

What Donald Trump did with sponsors at the Easter Egg event is a very great thing because now the taxpayer can raise some money with Pentagon Pete's Makeup Studio by Ulta or Sephora and maybe they can even sell some special Camouflage Palettes with very either some very Natural Desert Dazzle Tones or Pete's Urban Blue.,postsshortcomments,2025-04-26T11:45:56,1

yeah I’m gay myself and this is kind of shocking to me. like I understand putting on a little make up before you sit in front of a camera and lights but to the point where you need a damn make up studio installed? I have nothing wrong with men wearing make up but when they’re ALSO homophobic AND complaining how we need to “bring back masculinity” at the same time I start to get real confused.,mickeyanonymousse,2025-04-26T10:07:33,34

"They're just trying to look fabulous dahlin and go out for a little queer bash.        I'd love if reporters would ask sincere, non-homophobic questions to him about it such as ""Does that make-up help you feel more comfortable in your skin?"" ""Do you appreciate how you look better, after you take the time to put your make up on?"" ""Do you feel empowered?"" ",WonLastTriangle2,2025-04-26T10:42:11,13
Reporters won’t do that though for fear of either losing Trump-friendly advertisers or pissing off the people that own them.   Bill Burr said it the most succinctly - journalists don’t have the balls to do their actual job anymore.,dukeoftrappington,2025-04-26T13:24:05,3
