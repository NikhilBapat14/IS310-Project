She's wrong though. Mexico was for sale...to the cartels.,Sangmund_Froid,2025-05-03T18:36:55,69
Sheâ€™s already bought and paid for. Â The cartel is a major part of their economy.,j3remy2007,2025-05-03T18:58:09,44
"I saw the movie Somo. Changed my perspective a bit. The cartels are as evil as any serial killers out there. They would start unleashing tear on Mexican citizens and maybe migrants. They torture, rape, and do unspeakable things. It would have to be very carefully planned. Just google Los Zetas and youâ€™ll see what they did in the past. I donâ€™t want to see torture videos of children out there. What she needs to do is get the corruption out of her police force. There needs to be a culture shift away from the narco state. If we did take it on, we would have to treat it like Isis. It cannot be half way done, they need to go after all the cartels at once.",Dazzling_Pink9751,2025-05-03T20:16:58,13
"Atleast she acknowledged they have an issue and declined help due to ""sovereignty ðŸ¤£"".  Thats more of an acknowledgement of a cartel problem than I expected Cartel Claudia to give. I totally would have expected ""What Cartels?"".",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-05-03T18:43:01,20
The entire Mexican government is corrupt. We would have to basically have mexico start over.,Long_Jelly_9557,2025-05-03T21:46:42,8
