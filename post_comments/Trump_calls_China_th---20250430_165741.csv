"At this point, why would the Chinese negotiate when they could just watch Trump flail and flounder and negotiate with himself in front of the whole world? Yeah, it's going to hurt their economy but it's not like they have to worry about losing elections.",TurboSalsa,2025-04-30T17:04:34,10

"Why won't the White  House just release the recordings of American officials negotiating with Chinese officials? Surely these conversations are recorded. So just release the tapes, and everybody can see that America is telling the truth.",xibeno9261,2025-04-30T17:14:09,2

Lol there's people on here who seem to think if he just rolls back the tariffs China will just resume trade as normal after all of this.   Crazy thinking.   It's entirely possible China might not want to deal with the US at all until the next administration because of this stuff.,Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-30T17:38:06,8

"Actually, they have used USA to become what China is today, and most probably leaving USA behind.  They simply do not need USA. No one talks in USA, but they have educated 1,5 million mathematicians, physicist and engineers in USA universities for the last 20 years.   They have transferred all sorts of production knowledge in their country. They can simply produce anything USA can produce. Their technology and science is as least as good as USA. It is not recognized yet.  They are now flirting with EU. They have eliminated all tariffs from Africa. They have been building strong relationship with South America.  So, frankly speaking, USA already lost this battle. All these years while China was getting stronger, USA was bombing Middle East. What a stupid strategy.",akreditif,2025-04-30T18:40:18,7
