"They didn't ""miss"" anything.  Not once.  All of their reporting was intentional, as was their silence.",Device_whisperer,2025-04-29T15:07:43,48
"Todd asserted that the alleged cover-up of Biden's mental decline was ""not a media failure,"" but rather ""a failure of the Democratic Party.""  They’re the same, Todd.  They’re both the same thing.  ",j3remy2007,2025-04-29T15:00:44,27
"You can’t make this sh!t up:  I just refuse to accept this stupid premise because it's a right-wing manufactured, right-wing premise, in order to stain the media,"" Todd said.  It was a right-wing manufactured story when the media wouldn’t report on it, and now it’s a right-wing manufactured story when we point out the media refused to report on it.  What a c@nt.",j3remy2007,2025-04-29T15:03:21,25
Who? Joe? Joe who? The President? “Give me a scoop of chocolate ice cream and make it vanilla”!  How would you like your eggs?,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-29T14:04:35,11
"Todd is just mad that they've been exposed for their blatant propaganda.  He wants ""credit"" for reporting ""clues"" to Biden's failing mental capacity?  He wants credit HIMSELF a journalist, while dismissing everyone else, yet he FAILED to ask any probing questions, like the President having a ""lid"", or like why he didn't have any press conferences, and many more.  Everyone who changed their voter registration party affiliation, everyone who voted for the first time in years, every foreign dignitary or foreign country's leader who met with Biden, and everyone else who voted for Trump, KNEW Biden wasn't all there.... why didn't YOU, Chuck Todd?!  ![gif](giphy|EouEzI5bBR8uk|downsized)",Ida_PotatHo,2025-04-29T15:09:32,9
Chuck Todd still carrying water for his dishonest colleagues. Because that way he doesn't have to own up to his own dishonesty and biased reporting.,WPWeasel,2025-04-29T15:48:01,5

The Dear Leader was a useful tool of the apparatchiks of the Democrat Socialist Party. It failed when they couldn't keep him in the basement anymore.,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-29T18:02:50,3

Yet the Kims have found a way to keep their oppression going within their own borders.... if I understand your reference.  Or were you intimating that 'sunshine is the best disinfectant' and/or 'knowledge is power'. 🤔,Ida_PotatHo,2025-04-29T18:44:52,1
