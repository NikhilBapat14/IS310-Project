"The DNC will issue the party platform next week.  There are are primary candidates policy proposals and then the official Party agreed to policy proposals.  Given the short run time there isn't a former online, just the speeches, while the latter have always been crafted by delegates at the Conventions.",federalist66,2024-08-18T07:44:17,10
"Traditionally party/candidate platforms are publicly released alongside party conventions. The increased focus on primaries has altered this a bit, with candidates releasing partial platforms during the primary as a way to stand out from the competition. Harris, who didn't go through a traditional primary process this cycle, doesn't really have a reason to preempt the party convention.  Trump and the GOP, on the other hand, still haven't released a cognizant or recognizable platform (instead they have a 20-point list of *goals*, notably almost completely bereft of policy, as well as a 16-page PDF containing a mix of disinformation, soapboxing, goals, and an exceedingly small list of a few actual policies), which fuels the speculation that their *actual* policy is Project 2025.",cossiander,2024-08-18T11:46:19,6
"Yeah it seems at least for Harris that’s the case. I would in the past always go to a candidates website and they’d have it.  Digging around, it seems like NPR has a good article listing the recent policy speech and other things she’s said (and what’s unknown). [Here’s the article](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/18/nx-s1-5008844/democratic-national-convention-harris-policy)",aKamikazePilot,2024-08-18T06:54:54,5
"The league of women voters interviews candidates all the way down the ballot and in most areas sends out a lengthy mailer to every resident from the local chapter.These mailers contain candidates responses to a range of questions as well as statements from advocacy groups in favor/opposed to local ballot measures. Most serious candidates respond to their interview questions because it's free press and a deciding factor for many voters.  If they don't have a mailer in your area, they probably have a website. The national site is https://www.lwv.org.",scubafork,2024-08-18T09:34:02,3
"Aha, that actually makes sense, thanks.",spacester,2024-08-18T09:43:27,5
Lol I always felt I was one of the few who would actually go to the candidate's or elected official's website for answers on policy question. Looks like I was right about that much.,spacester,2024-08-18T09:47:06,1
"Thanks, it's good to know  the LWV still does its thing. I had forgotten about them, actually.",spacester,2024-08-18T09:43:01,2
"Yeah, in normal circumstances you'd have a candidate with their own platform who campaigned on that platform to win the most delegates and then the delegates elected during the primary would craft the official platform largely based off thay victorious primary campaign platform though the delegates attached to any other candidate may be able to influence the platform especially if they got a large alliances to the convention; you saw that in 2016 when the Bernie folks got some planks onto the platform despite losing. In this case Biden won 99% of the delegates and then dropped out one month before the Convention.  Harris, as Biden's designated successor has spent that month focused on the nuts and bolts of securing the nomination like making sure the delegates back her, getting a running mate, making sure the campaign staff and ad buys are in place.  She can then hit the ground running with the Party agreed to platform that will be crafted and everything is up and running. Starting next Friday, the day after the convention things should be about where things resemble a more typical Presidential campaign.",federalist66,2024-08-18T11:02:31,6
