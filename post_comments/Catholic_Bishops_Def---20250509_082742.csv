This sets up a massive First Amendment fight. Confession vs. state law is about to hit the courts hard.,fulltrendypro,2025-05-09T08:31:37,25

I don’t see any way this passes first amendment muster.  Confession is such a central thing for Catholicism that they have a fairly legitimate first amendment argument (unlike some of the other religious freedom nonsense they bring up),Cactusfan86,2025-05-09T08:40:58,11
"##Summary:  Catholic bishops in Washington state are **rejecting a new law that requires clergy to report child sexual abuse** revealed during the sacrament of confession.  The new statute — signed by **Governor Bob Ferguson and set to take effect July 27 — mandates clergy report suspected child abuse within 48 hours**.  However, a priest who reveals anything told to him during confession will be excommunicated from the Church.  State senator Noel Frame, wrote the law in part **due to practices within the Jehovah's Witness church**. Former Jehovah's Witness Marino Hardin said: ""Leaving an exception in for the confessional when it comes to mandatory reporting would allow any religious group that had a mandate for secrecy to say, '**We don't have to report anything**.'""  Bishops Thomas Daly of Spokane and Paul Etienne of Seattle have **publicly stated that they will not comply with the law**.  State senator Frame has said the **Washington law is not anti-Catholic because it applies to all clergy in the state**.  Washington Governor Bob Ferguson said in a statement on Wednesday: ""**We look forward to protecting Washington kids from sexual abuse in the face of this 'investigation' from the Trump Administration**.""",Aakash7aak,2025-05-09T08:36:41,5

"The state has a genuine interest in protecting children.  They don't have to make specific exceptions for a religion.      There's quite a decent amount of precedent for that. If the state has a compelling interest and is not intentionally discriminating, it can pass the law and it's the religion's problem.  A religion that requires stoning of sinners can't ignore laws on murder, for example.  And there's cases on this; courts have ruled that the states were allowed to ban polygamy despite religious beliefs in it, for example.       Additionally, there's lots of examples of other religions abusing clergy-penitent privilege to avoid reporting, and strong arguments for not allowing it.  I was involved in this law in WA; they chose not to allow clergy-penitent privilege as a reason to not report *because of repeated abuses by other religions*, especially the Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons, not because of the Catholics.     Also, to be clear, this law just requires mandatory reporting of child abuse with no exceptions, regardless of privilege otherwise.  It doesn't pierce the privilege for courtrooms.  Five other states already do this.  Texas actually makes attorneys mandatory reporters too; they can't be compelled to testify against their client, but they still have to notify someone if they are aware a child is being abused.  *Exactly the same as the WA law*.     I think that there's pretty solid prior cases to support it passing, and a few attorneys have told me the same. However, we do have a bit of a religious activist federal Supreme Court at the moment.",MyLittlePIMO,2025-05-09T12:36:40,2
