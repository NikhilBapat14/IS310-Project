This poster rocks. Right wing grifters like Alex Jones love to talk about how we're paid Soros plants. Well we're not. We're just regular people who haven't been brainwashed so we know how fucked up all this is.,big_guyforyou,2025-04-11T20:01:46,106

Trump is definitely playing the role of the heel to a T. Haven't figured out why yet but I'm sure there is a lot going on behind the scenes. His handlers directing him like a wrecking ball and busting down the walls of a corrupt institution? I dont love or hate him for any of it. I just wish I knew what the end game was. The headlines are confusing and definitely designed to get people pissed off.,christophlc6,2025-04-12T08:26:15,5

People tend to image history's worst figures as these comic book style villains, evil incarnate, when in reality they're just regular people who chose to do some very awful things.
