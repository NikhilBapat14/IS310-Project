Did they order these from China before the tariffs went into effect?,Sarcasmgasmizm,2025-04-24T15:16:30,26

"I propose to issue a print run of ""Obama 2028"" and ""George Bush Jr. 2028"" caps. After all, if it's a third term, there's no reason to limit other candidates.",Annual-Magician-1580,2025-04-24T15:30:11,10
"I cant fundamentally understand how anyone could vote for this and be ok with it at the same time. I served in Marine infantry, two combat tours, and I hate everything about this country and administration. I have no patriotism, and something coming close to hatred for the people that are ok with this and allowing it. Had to even get rid of the girlfriend because she was a MAGA dumbass. How sad is that",bmkerce,2025-04-24T15:21:55,12
"So we're at that point in the Trump Administration's descent into authoritarianism where they are just flouting their disregard for the constitution, no, practically bragging about it.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-24T15:23:57,5
"China hands Trump his lunch.  Trump hands out hats made in Chinas.  You don't suppose he sent out a tweet saying ""Xi. STOP!""",NoOneStranger_227,2025-04-24T15:43:50,2
"This ""administration"" doesn't have the lift to make it past 2025, gravity is going to wreck it well before '28. That or the hamburders are going to put an end to this shit show.",AsamaMaru,2025-04-24T17:28:26,2

"Seems to be a pretty transparent distraction to throw the media off all the other bad news oozing out of the white house.  This is like the 3rd news cycle where they've thrown this out right after some other scandal has surfaced, the media latches onto it hook line and sinker.  Not trying to minimize it, definitely take his threat seriously, but this is nothing new.",O918,2025-04-24T18:26:38,1
"I dont care.  This is ""own the libs"" bait.  I'll concern myself with it after the midterms or if he makes legislative moves.",KingThar,2025-04-24T16:09:25,1
"Yes- it takes about 3-6 months to take apparel from idea to shipped from China, especially for something at this scale. Trump started having these made the day after the election ",Tea_Alarmed,2025-04-24T15:47:32,6
Grifting. This is pure grift. He always has a moneymaking angle to everything he does.,Feeling-Success-385,2025-04-24T15:23:03,14
Is it legal to have a campaign for an office you're not eligible to run for?,musKholecasualty,2025-04-24T16:48:18,5
"The wording they're using is that it's ok for a president who has been elected to \*non consecutive\* terms to run a third time.  But if Trump won 2020, then that means he's won three times.  So somewhere in here, there's a lie.  What a shock.  Anyway, that's their grade school ""if I hold my hands to my eyes no one can see me"" reasoning why Bush and Clinton and Obama can't run again.",minicpst,2025-04-24T15:53:37,5
"Wow, thanks for sharing.  I feel we are all stressed out by what is going on.  And we can't lose sight of what is right!",hijitus,2025-04-24T15:26:23,5
"All things considered, cutting these people out is probably better for us long term. How can you trust someone to be in your life when this is what they think is not only normal but good? They’re selling everyone out for whatever thing they have latched on to with Trump. I’ve lost in laws and while I’m angry and hurt ultimately it’s easier than dealing with their bullshit.",myfakesecretaccount,2025-04-24T17:37:57,1
"That point was during the election when he straight up told people they would never have to vote again if he won.  Americans, and I say this as one, are delusional morons.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-04-24T15:30:17,3
"Thanks to the party of ""law and order """,hijitus,2025-04-24T15:27:50,2
"Trump family run as President and VP. Say Donald Jr. and Eric. Trump becomes Speaker of the House, which is not specified as a member of Congress. Don Jr. and Eric step down, Trump becomes President for a third term as the 22nd Amendment only prohibits running for President, not serving as President. The office becomes the family business. Don't put this past them.  Trump 2028.  The hat doesn't say it has to be dad.",CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T15:34:23,1
"People keep saying the “if he won, then this is his third” line, but he didn’t serve that term (ignoring that he really did lose). Since he didn’t serve as president from Jan 2021 to Jan 2025, this is his second term.",ElderSmackJack,2025-04-24T17:11:28,1

Doesn't matter.  They'll run with full disclosure of the plan - a vote for us is a vote for Dad.  And this is assuming we'll have free and fair elections in 2028.  All bets are off with this regime.,CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-24T16:32:16,1
