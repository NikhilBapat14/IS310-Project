"What appears to have happened is: Trump's team (probably Stephen Miller) made up this story about how the 4 tattoos, which are just pictures of things like a marijuana leaf and a cross, that he has on his fingers ""represent"" the characters 'MS13.' Someone on his team did a little MS-Paint doodlegraphic to demonstrate this. Trump apparently misunderstands this graphic, and doesn't realize the letters on the photograph are clearly just like Arial font simple Paint letters not even intended to look like tattoos. I dont think the picture was ever intended to be like a sophisticated photoshop to fool people into thinking he has those letters tattooed on his fingers, but nevertheless it ""fooled"" Trump.   Then, before anyone on his team has a chance to correct him he posts on Truth social about it, though this post is vague enough for his proponents to cast doubt and say ""No he didn't mean those are the literal tattoos, he's talking about the icons *representing* the characters, just like the original picture was intended for.""  *Then* he does this interview and very very clearly and repeatedly states that, no, he really truly believes the literal characters 'MS13' are tattooed in Arial-ass font on his fingers.

"Just to be as impartial as I can be, I will try to retell as much empirical fact as possible. The tattoos he actually has on his fingers are:  - A marijuana leaf  - A smiley face  - A cross  - A skull  They seem to be fairly typical icons that people might get tattooed on them, like picked from any tattoo parlor's book of generic options.   The Trump administration submitted this argument about this ""secret code"" thing with no further evidence or explanation -- like they have no other examples of bona fide MS13 members having ""code"" tattos like this, or proof this is even a thing that MS13 gang members do. They have also offered no explanation for why a cross would represent a '1' or why a skull would represent '3' ('Marijuana' and 'Smiley' is the assumption for the first two, but that is very easily coincidental and relies on the premise that Salvadoran gang members would refer to those icons as 'Marijuana' and 'Smiley Face', which seems pretty tenuous at best).   Impartiality off: I think it's pretty clear this is nonsense, and a post hoc attempt to justify their claims, especially since this picture cropped up so late into this process. If this was their reasoning all along then it doesn't make sense they wouldn't offer it in court, or when the situation was made public, or any other time before just now. They're acting like it's a smoking gun, so if it is then why just bring it up now?  Finally, regardless of any of this, Abrego Garcia has had no chance to defend himself. If the administration would like to submit this as their legal justification for what they are doing to him, then they should do so in court where both sides have a chance to state their case. That's like...the entire point of due process. Which is why everyone is yelling about it.   Also, I probably shouldn't even have to say this but don't want to neglect it: tattoos aren't illegal.

When I was in highschool, a kid was stabbed because he wore the wrong color and he didnt belong to the gang. Only someone who doesnt know how gang work are surprised that yeah, wearing a bulls hat, having thes knuckle tattoos, and being in company of known ms-13 members in a area controlled by ms-13 more likely than not means you yourself are a ms-13 member.
