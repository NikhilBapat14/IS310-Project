"Tesla is pretty much doomed because of Elon and his exposure over the last 2 years. He has become a liability for the company. Elon used to entice investment by promising innovation and vision to investors and the general public. He truly had that Steve Jobs charisma that was needed to get both the public as well as the investors to believe in an idea that was not quite a reality but was just around the corner and about to pay off big, both for the investors and for the green movement, that was and is still sweeping across the planet. The problem now is that Elon has been exposed as a snake oil salesman who not only can not deliver on his mission statements but also had no intention of doing so in the first place. Elon has a much more sinister goal.  His goal is to become a world dictator. If not ,the world's dictator. He built his house of cards by aligning himself with those who can facilitate his immediate objectives without having to be held accountable. Elon knows his time to sieze power is slipping away fast and he will do whatever is necessary to try and hold on. This is a man who really is loyal to no one or no country. He will sell out the US and The Donald to other people like himself who wish to enslave the people of this world to both stay powerful and safe from prosecution. What Elon represents is not new or unique. Elon is nothing more than an emperor without clothes.",bigalcapone22,2025-04-22T16:59:17,9

"My theory:  He's going to let Tesla die.  He's already begun siphoning IPs and tech from Tesla away from Tesla - he knows he's poison to that brand now.. and he doesn't own a whole lot of it.  Thus, it makes more sense for him to abandon it.  Especially given how NONE of his ideas are panning out, he's got no hope of passing regulatory measures for self-driving cars let alone taxis.  Investors aren't going to believe his bullshit anymore.  It makes a HELL of a lot more sense to focus on SpaceX; his position within the government gives him the ability to steer funding to it; he owns it; it will produce more people-friendly results and branding is less toxic despite his association.  The only pitfall to this is what he himself has said: if Dems win the White House back.. he might get legally fucked.       Either way..?  Tesla is going to die.  It cannot compete with Chinese EVs anymore - period.  Its losing on average 30-40% sales annually in the countries that matter with one exception: England (I believe).

"He isn’t doing anything anywhere. Even if he leaves doge what doge is doing will not stop. This is scapegoat mechanism. Make one person the target of the masses hate then have them go away so people think the problem is gone. He is expected to leave around September.  X is partnered with visa to make it a financial platform. Elon has said as part of the doge team using AI to rewrite all the social security code he wants to include in it the ability to make x the way folks can receive their benefits. Basically routed through x to get to their bank accounts. Rewriting the SSA code should take years instead he wants it done by September. He wants X to be an app to handle everything government related. The New York Times has an insane article come out but it totally makes sense. DOGE teams have received clearance under an interagency agreement and arrived at the National credit Union Administration and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and FAA.  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-musk-data-access.html  A few insane things are happening on September 30. I’m missing a lot of stuff but here are 5 of them.  1.) The executive order Trump signed on April 9 kicks in. It’s a sunset type of order to remove all environmental protections and regulations to allow for drilling and mining of all federal lands including national parks. It’s why he has already authorized cutting down hectares of land for timber. Before folks say it’s only an order which can be blocked by the courts. The courts are already mostly ruling in his favor and the few times they didn’t he appealed and higher courts ruled for him. Hell the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 against him and the DOJ said they won’t abide by it.  Project 2025 includes the stripping of the land and selling it off once they test to see where the resources are located.  https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trump-quietly-plans-to-liquidate-public-lands-to-finance-his-sovereign-wealth-fund/  2.) the deferred retirement program Elon setup to get rid of federal employees kicks in September 30 (hundreds of thousands of employees)  3.) the funding gap bill ends on September 30 for the government to keep paying out  4.) By the end of September Elon Musk says the code for social security will be rewritten, which to be clear is something that should take years to code. This is why his DOGE team had hard physical access to every federal agency from the dept of education to  the USDA including the treasury payments system. This is why his former employee Amanda Scales went to OPM and set up a private server hosted in a foreign country. Now the same DOGE team that Palantir found for Elon is saying Palantir should manage all the social security data.  5.) this is bizarre but RFK Jr says he will have solved the autism “pandemic” by the end of September.",nycdiveshack,2025-04-22T19:39:36,3

"Couple of things, Starlink isn't the only option for satellite internet, it's just the biggest.  Eutelsat for example is also a significant constellation.  Also there are multiple alternatives to GPS, such as GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, IRNSS & QZSS.  US control of GPS doesn't stop anything anymore.  The challenge that any competitor has to Starlink though is SpaceX's lift capability.  They are just SO much cheaper than any other lift provider.    But thats the thing, Starlink is only a tiny sliver of SpaceX's potential.  Falcon 9 costs about $2700 to put a kilo into orbit, Ariane 5 is about $9500 per kilo.  Space Shuttle was north of $50k per kilo.  If starship is successful you're looking at \~$200 per kilo to orbit, and you're now in the price range of DHL international shipment.  To put that into perspective, the hubble is roughly 10,000kg.   Sending that up on an Ariane 5 is $95 million, $27 million on a Falcon 9, and \~$2 million on a Starship.  All of a sudden lobbing large payloads to orbit becomes absolutely worthwhile.  Things like ZBLAN optic fiber, which is optic fiber made in zero G are incredibly better than optic fiber made on the ground, become absolutely viable if you can send up the material at 200 per kilo.  Starlink is amazing, but it's a tiny fraction of SpaceX and no way in hell will starlink drag SpaceX into an internet standards body or anything like that.",Harlequin80,2025-04-22T18:48:08,8

Many of the EV are not in a good spot to be used in rural America. Many rural Americans commute and everything is so scattered with so few chargers.

" One fun story was on our way from Iowa to KC there was a point where there was one charger over 100miles away from the last charger. While driving with a charging plan in place on the car computer, we suddenly get a notification to turn the car around and go back nearly 50+miles to our last charger in Iowa. We wouldn’t make it to KC with the charge remaining in our battery if we kept going and if we didn’t turn back immediately we wouldn’t make it back to the charger in Iowa. Turns out a storm knocked out the electricity at the supercharger station and it was out. We almost turned around but we found a destination charger in some post apocalyptic looking truck stop station. So we went there and plugged it in while waiting for the power to come back. A few hours later we see the computer tells us it’s back on and we took the chance and decided to go to that station knowing there’s a risk it could go out again. Was not fun.   Another situation occurred when we tried to drive from Denver to big sky Montana. Basically it would be super risky because there was a gap of 150 miles between chargers and even though the tesla says you have 210 miles on a full charge, it actually is ~145miles.

"I thought he deplatformed the girl who turned him down. None of them get anything but Texas levels of child support out of him, so they aren’t clever if they go through with it. He is going to be breeding an army of not too bright kids with daddy issues",MadAstrid,2025-04-22T20:53:36,7
"Shotwell is arguably more important to the current success of SpaceX than Musk. Elon (and friends) provided the initial funding and vision, but it was Shotwell who pitched the company to early investors, secured contracts, worked with customers to assure stability during the rough patches, and still runs interference to Elon.   SpaceX may be Musk's baby, but Shotwell raised it through puberty and into the world's leading launch provider. Much like Musk's other children, someone else is responsible for the successes.",TheMrGUnit,2025-04-23T08:47:14,6
Just want to say SpaceX isn't as successful as people think  Sure they launch alot but 80% of SpaceX launches are for starlink.   The government gave SpaceX 4 billions dollar to LAND PEOPLE ON THE MOON using starship. They are about to burn all of it without even successfully even exiting orbit.   Pretty much the best way DOGE could have run is unironically defund SpaceX.,frzned,2025-04-23T01:11:23,2

"You are 100% correct. My EV is the primary car and the one in use all days, several times a day. I do have access to a diesel car, but it is not really in use as I have no use cases for it. It starts rough in winter, it takes a lot of time to heat in winter,  I have to visit a petrol station to fill it... Sure, it can drive longer than my EV before refilling and that happens faster, but the EV recharges so fast I barely have time to go to the bathroom on road trips.",General_Helicopter1,2025-04-23T02:01:59,1

"> To be determined if this was a successful rebrand.  You already said it was in the start of this conversation...  > Elon has successfully rebranded this and you’re all falling for it.   And again just now...  > The stock ticker this morning suggests rebranding may have been more successful than you will admit.  I think I'm misunderstanding what you're referring to as the thing rebranded. I thought you meant his depature, rebranded from a planned departure to resignation in shame. This is why I was confused, as no one would ever attempt such a rebrand and that change in perception is a monumental failure, not any kind of success. If you meant he rebranded something else (DOGE? The government? The stock market?) then please let me know what.",TheAquamen,2025-04-23T09:09:24,1
"> the correct way to do it would be to play the game like a normal person and blunder. It shows that he doesn’t have time to master a game.  Exactly. If I was the multi-billionaire CEO of a public company whose stock price depends on the lies I tell people about how I sleep in the office because I work 40 hours a day, the lying I would do would be about how BAD I was at gaming.   If I was highly ranked in any game, I'd lie and tell people I never played it. It seems bonkers to me that a guy who constantly lies about how much he works, works, works, not only has no shame in bragging about how he's the top ranked Diablo player, but he's also bragging with a lie, like a teenage boy would.   He genuinely wants us to believe he's a superhuman who can excel at everything while also working all day. I heard a theory once that he fully believes he lives in a simulation and he is the main character of it, like a fully immersive reality game.   Wouldn't surprise me one bit if that was true. The only thing this dude has innovated is ""main character syndrome.""",weacob,2025-04-23T05:22:36,13

"What did you test it against? I'm either looking at a new 2LT, or a used Ioniq 5 AWD, or a used Polestar 2.  Heavily leaning toward the Chevy or the Hyundai but that polestar sure looks fun.",Em_Es_Judd,2025-04-22T20:57:45,1
