Russia invaded Ukraine.  Not the other way around.  Russia needs to withdraw from Ukraine.,Algum,2025-04-23T14:54:03,390
What a measured and mature perspective on the conflict; thank you for sharing.,zVitiate,2025-04-23T15:02:44,104
Either advocate for the 82nd airborne to be dropped in or just be quiet because there is no possible way the Ukraine is retaking all the land back without nato troops on the ground. Ukraine has a population crisis and 4 more years of war would just demographically destroy it. This war has to end in a  settlement. ,Torchwood777,2025-04-23T16:39:04,34
Ok neat. Now explain how that will get done with out Americans shedding any blood.,Nifty_5050,2025-04-23T15:55:23,5
"And ukraine did not need to push for nato membership, and they knew what would happen when they did. Russia foes not want US weapons at its doorstep, much in the same way that if China or russia put weapons on the US’ doorstep, they wouldnt let it stand either(cuban missile crisis springs to mind here)",Xander_hades_,2025-04-23T15:04:34,-73
Apply that to every country we invaded and see the fault in your logic.,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-23T16:22:23,-20
And Democrats need to get over their TDS and vegans need to accept that hamburgers taste good.  Anything else that needs to happen that I missed?,Shadeylark,2025-04-24T11:11:10,-1
"Not sure if you're being serious, but Russia having invaded Ukraine isn't even a question.  Strangely, that seems to get lost in many of the discussions.  Without acknowledging the facts, I don't see how any negotiated resolution is possible.",Algum,2025-04-23T16:20:29,149
Take a look at your flair for a hint.,Algum,2025-04-23T16:58:04,-5
"That reads like Her Skirt Was Too Short justification.   Regardless of how the West and Ukraine could have handled things differently, let's not minimize Putin's evil and try to justify his 100% responsibility for invading.",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T15:57:36,112
"Also, intention to join NATO is not the same as being a part of NATO, just like negotiating with random Dems behind the scenes is not the same as negotiating with our current executive.  We've been *telling them no* for ages and the state of their application is only marginally better than it's ever been, but the left keeps spinning things like they're already a full member with full benefits. Ukraine needs elections, saying 'no election in a time of war' is a bad match with **fighting indefinitely.**   Their government wants to fight to the last drop, they want their fight to be our fight, and they also give us flak when we try to make economic deals. They're not acting like they're our friend or partner, they're acting like they can swipe a card all through town and the card is our responsibility.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-23T15:40:48,13
Most understand the difference between liberation and conquest.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T16:47:03,30
"Problem is, nobody has a real solution for the inevitable ""No"" from Russia.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-23T16:58:19,60
Ukraine is incapable of taking that land back on their own accord.,Nifty_5050,2025-04-23T18:17:37,17
"To be fair, some in the West were more than a little encouraging in regards to NATO membership.  Listen, I can spend the day criticizing Ukraine but I draw the line that the ultimate responsibility for the invasion is firmly on Putin's head.",Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T17:43:43,12
The line between hero and traitor is written by the victor's pen.,Reuters-no-bias-lol,2025-04-23T17:10:35,7
"If Putin continues to think that the US will let him do what he wants, you're probably right.  My feeling (and I could very well be wrong) is that this is a proxy war between Russia and the US/West.  Our actions now will have consequences for a very long time and I think we're sending Putin a dangerous message that will hurt the US.",Algum,2025-04-23T17:06:22,68
An over simplification as history has proven since the beginning. No more true than modern history which screams it's principled objection.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-23T17:37:22,10
"I feel like your side is always intentionally vague with your comments. Please say exactly what you're proposing. Direct intervention? Massive amounts of aid? What would satisfy you? The latter won't get Ukraine its territory back, and will cost Ukraine more lives and their future economic situation in the process. The former would put the world's two nuclear powers directly at war, and would be sending American fathers and sons to die fighting a country that has proven itself to be no real threat to the USA geopolitically (unless we're forgetting that they're failing to conquer an impoverished country they share a massive border with after years of all-out warfare).  I do not see a single path in continuing this war that benefits the USA or Ukraine.",PhilosophicallyNaive,2025-04-23T22:15:25,12
"We don’t manufacture like Russia does, let alone their bloc, for the military stuffs used in the Donbas; Ukraine has run out of willing men and doesn’t have that many unwilling without completely jeopardizing its future; and you can go fight the war, but I’m okay personally thank you.  Yes, Russia’s troops were the ones that crossed Ukraine’s borders in the early morning of February 24, 2022. And??",zVitiate,2025-04-23T17:16:53,-23
And….we shouldn’t just let Russia cross other country’s borders freely. That’s kinda of the whole point here.,DandierChip,2025-04-23T18:43:27,41
What was free about it? We gave Ukraine weapons and support and they killed 10s of thousands of Russians. We also sanctioned Russia and tanked their economy. ,GetADamnJobYaBum,2025-04-23T18:55:50,4
"It’s been three years of bloody fighting, including a military mutiny and invasion both on Russian soil, and yet people are acting like it’s the partition of Czechoslovakia or something lmao",zVitiate,2025-04-23T22:26:53,2
