Other nations watch American news and understand the political divide in this country. They understand the geography of American politics the same way I know the Kurds live in Iraq's north and people in Tibet aren't Han Chinese.  So they are definitely trying to pressure the Trump administration by targeting his base. It probably goes way further than just tariffs too,1QAte4,2025-05-07T21:08:27,49
"Unfortunately you’re asking a bunch of people who believed Trump’s nonsense to now engage in critical thinking about why their economic fortunes are being diminished by retaliatory trade policies.

"It makes sense that these countries would choose a more strategic response than just tariffing everything. Because tariffs hurt them as well.  If they are going to implement counter tariffs, they want to make it as targeted as possible, which would specifically target the voting group that is behind the current President’s power in hopes that he will change his actions.",Alert-Algae-6674,2025-05-07T21:44:15,11

"As a Canadian, we are purposely being selective in our retaliatory tariff.  Our Prime Minister Mark Carney said it when he first took the job: There is a limit to what Canada can do on dollar-to-dollar matching tariff because US is a much larger economy than Canada  It probably won’t changed the mind of deep red states voters, but we do want them to suffer.

Forget about foreigners targeting specific political groups republicans do it to their fellow citizens. In the 2017 tax cut republicans targeted blue states by limiting their itemized deductions and that hit blue states harder because they have higher incomes and higher housing prices. And today in their attempts to cut Medicare they are looking at a cap on federal contributions to states which would also hit blue states harder because they are more generous to their citizens than any red state. The world over politics has become a team sport.,New_Seaweed_6554,2025-05-08T08:59:15,1

"Trump is following the Great Depression play book. Stock market upset. Blanket tariffs. Mass ‘deportation’. Nevermind the fact he’s playing trade war games with countries that hold extreme amounts of US debt. If China called due even a portion of the US debt it holds, the value of the dollar would plummet. AND this *really* hurts small businesses who don’t have the kind of capital necessary (or who use ingredients that cannot be sourced in the US at all) to make massive investments to manufacture their products fully in the US. Tariffs *before* investment in infrastructure is at least part of the issue with this whole thing. Even getting all the machinery necessary to equip a factory would be a massive expense, as the machinery would be subject to tariffs as well. The price tag for entry is enough to squash out small businesses and leave it all to mega corporations (which inevitably would lead to a labor rights movement revival), but even mega corporations have been doing layoffs for months due to the economic outlook. Even if they would be interested in the investment, the time is not now, when everything is so volatile. It’s impossible to make solid business decisions when the circumstances are changing by the hour.",CremePsychological77,2025-05-08T02:57:23,2

"That's not true. China isn't self-sufficient on food or energy, both of which it gets in large quantities (in the double-digit percentages depending on the product) from the US.

Some consequences of GOP policies have been felt. Farm bankruptcies have increased from the first round of tariffs in 2018-2019. Consolidation of farms has been occurring for awhile due to political decisions. It is hard to directly connect consequences to specific policies and we rarely see these measure make headlines since talking about history is not as sensational as today's actions and commentary.,Matt2_ASC,2025-05-08T15:01:24,1

">If China called due even a portion of the US debt it holds, the value of the dollar would plummet.  How would that even work? My understanding is that China owns most of its US debt in the form of bonds. You can't just ""call a bond due"" that's not delinquent. That would be like the bank calling you up tomorrow and demanding you pay your entrie mortgage. There are terms to the loan and as long as you keep your end the deal, they can't be called due.  What China can do is unload their current supply of bonds onto the market, which might cause a crisis of confidence in their security as an investment, which then might hurt the dollar. But that is speculative and depends on how other markets react.",Kuramhan,2025-05-08T09:35:54,1

"I'm not going to defend the GOP but in all fairness the first round of tariffs were kept in place during the Biden administration so it is hardly correct to call them GOP policies.  Here are my thoughts on policy and farming: We don't have competition and we need it. The food supply is run by a few major companies and that doesn't work with capitalism. I will make a stupid comment; instead of subsidizing soybean farmers for tariffs - give some small business loans out to stand up some beef and egg suppliers to those impacted farmers... I can't speak to the complexity of that as im not a farmer and don't know all of the elements of the supply chain etc... but what I know is that capitalism works on competition, we don't have enough of it, and it seems like we can incentivize people to jump into the AG we need.",RCA2CE,2025-05-08T15:46:22,2
