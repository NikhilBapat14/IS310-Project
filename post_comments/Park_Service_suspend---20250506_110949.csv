I swear. This administration is like a cartoon villain. I have to make some apologies about cartoon antagonists being unrealistically evil. Trump has lowered the bar.,whooo_me,2025-05-06T13:55:13,5
This should reverse the deficit. ,epicredditdude1,2025-05-06T11:12:56,8

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is not close to presenting a human health hazard. It's other pollutants that do that.,s-17,2025-05-06T11:15:29,-5
Air pollution was a key reason Nixon created the EPA. Smog was so bad that NIXON was convinced of the political benefits of eradicating it…NIXON.,buffpepperonipony,2025-05-06T11:30:35,20

They could always give it a whirl and come back after to report the results. Just them though. Wouldn't want them to think the research is DEI or anything. ,WalksAmongHeathens,2025-05-06T15:52:38,3

"Yeah ok, let us know how you’re fairing when the next bout of wildfires start and smoke from Canada is in Georgia.   But, too, pollen data is captured in air quality monitoring.   Air quality is low cost critical information that gives folks opportunities to understand their environment around them and make choices about their daily lives.   What is so bad about that??",buffpepperonipony,2025-05-06T11:28:31,7
