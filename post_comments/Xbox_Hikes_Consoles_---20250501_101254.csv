Looks like Xbox just unlocked a new difficulty level: “Affordability Mode!”,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-01T10:20:43,13
Lol it's now more expensive than when I bought mine in 2020.  Strangest console generation ever.  The original switch never got a price cut throughout its lifetime and now PlayStation and Xbox are both increasing the cost of the console throughout its lifetime.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-01T10:32:59,9
and MAGA is under the impression this (and computer part pricing) will motivate young american men to give up gaming and flock to the factories and fields for manual labor,BaconHammer9000,2025-05-01T10:52:10,9
And the prices will never go back down if/when tariffs are gone as they’ve normalized the price and will be used to those sweet sweet profits.,mr2chittles,2025-05-01T11:11:35,4
Ps6 and whatever the next Xbox will be $700 ez.,alabasterskim,2025-05-01T10:37:35,3
No thanks to Donald Trump and millions of his dumb voters.,reddittorbrigade,2025-05-01T10:40:22,3
Perhaps someone should explain tariffs and logistics... The actual full force of the tariffs just started a day or two ago. Products already in a container on a ship at the time of the tariff start date are exempt. Those containers take about a month to arrive. Our Port of LA knows weeks in advance of expected ships arriving. So starting NEXT WEEK there will be a 35% reduction of shipped goods to the Port. The ones that do arrive starting next week will have the full 145% tariff. There's about a one month inventory (on average) of goods here. June will bring out the angry mobs.,williamgman,2025-05-01T10:38:55,4
and thus ends the console wars cause video gaming in general has become too expensive thanks to trump,saiyanscaris,2025-05-01T18:20:38,2
"So now it's the same as Canadian prices, but in US dollars? lol",deepfryyourdog,2025-05-01T10:23:34,3
"Yeah, like there is some external event that is forcing these price increases. I can’t put my finger on it.",mandopix,2025-05-01T12:19:26,7
"More like starting at $999, with disc option costing extra.",santasnufkin,2025-05-01T10:58:04,3
"That will be Trump’s next reason to tariff Canada, we need to stop the illegal x box’s and IPhones from entering the US.",TubeframeMR2,2025-05-01T10:36:31,4
"They are doing it world-wide, there are no new tariffs elsewhere that force them to.",wintrmt3,2025-05-01T13:00:29,3
Yup. I was betting on $1000 weeks ago,Automatic-Advice-613,2025-05-01T12:13:42,1
Might as well deport the illegal Waters and oxygen from entering our country.,AngryTank,2025-05-01T11:10:55,1
