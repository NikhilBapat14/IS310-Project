"Since no one is going to click the article:  It’s discussing how access to more jobs don’t calm people down over the cost of living, if it just means they’d be working elsewhere for the same shitty pay. Biden tried that and it didn’t make people happy, now Trump is trying it and the article argues it still won’t work.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T08:30:52,7

"This article is about touting manufacturing jobs in the United States. Presidents do this on the regular, regardless of party.  >Even if firms do make more investments, that may produce greater increases in manufacturing *output* than *employment*, notes Adam Hersh, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research center. Even “if we had big new investments in manufacturing capacity, they wouldn’t be employing that many workers,” Hersh predicts, since any new plants will be heavily automated.  Anyone who's worked in any manufacturing job knows how shitty the day-to-day grind of the jobs are, how precarious it is to rely on a firm staying ashore and not outsourcing, and how much automation is involved in each of these new plants. There is no reliable upward pressure on wages, only threats from a Republican owner to continue to utilize migrant workers that he seems to have connections for bringing in.  This all is operating in a 45+ year era of American government policy coddling the elites with generous outpouring of tax breaks and redistribution towards them. Generational wealth transfer to the snotty trust-fund offspring are the seeds for new companies, not innovative thinkers.   Workers who have experienced the multifaceted squeeze over decades during all this are hardened, miffed, cynical, and know who's getting fucked over. It's them. It has been for decades. New factory, same old bullshit.",localistand,2025-05-07T08:41:14,2

I would argue they both wanted to re industrialize though Biden’s approach was more focused and used a carrot whereas Trump’s is board and uses a stick.   Also agree that neither would work well long term.,TubeframeMR2,2025-05-07T08:34:09,7
"Yep; in the run up to the election, Trump treated everyone like children, promising an economic revolution, while the Biden Administration treated everyone like adults and gave it to them straight; it's going to be a little while longer, but the benefits are on the way.  Trump walked in with a sledgehammer, destroyed any hope of those mid-to-long-term plans coming to fruition, and now his message has shifted and, if anything, is an even *worse* message than Biden's.  The Trump administration fucked up, they know they fucked up, and now they're trying to soften the upcoming hammer blow that they themselves orchestrated.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T08:42:44,7
"> Biden tried that and it didn’t make people happy  The article should have zeroed on the voters lack of patience but instead insinuates Trump's failings are just a continuation of Biden's policies, which of course is pure bullshit.   Biden tried many things to lift America out of the post-COVID funk that every country in the world was experiencing. Creating jobs was just one of the many initiatives. And Biden had the US poised to shake off the malaise quicker and more effectively than any country in the world. It wasn't even close.   Unfortunately, America has way too many impatient, low information voters who couldn't read the signs but instead thought, hey! let's bring back the guy who failed miserably before Biden to fuck things up to the nth degree.  If Harris wins America would be sitting pretty, comparitively speaking. At the end of the day it will always come down to the voter who managed to fuck this up royally.   Tbf, 75 million competent Americans did know this, but it wasn't enough.",biscuitarse,2025-05-07T09:31:24,0
"> it's going to be a little while longer, but the benefits are on the way.  That’s not really what Biden/Harris said though. They came across as saying things were fine, pointing to numbers that didn’t reflect lived experiences, and talking about “JOY” instead of the many emergencies we have.   Even Tim Walz came out criticizing that soft approach, saying the campaign should’ve been direct about the cost of living issues. That follows on what aides had been saying to the press too about a lack of decisive leadership as all kinds of corporate consultants came in. That’s why the “weird” and “couch fucking” trends died so abruptly.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T08:52:32,1
"> The article should have zeroed on the voters lack of patience   Voters have been loudly saying they have a problem with the cost of living for decades. It’s a choice for an administration to ignore short-term relief that gives people faith in the system in favor of long-term infrastructure projects when people are very upset and want to see immediate change. People who are worried about college tuition, student loans, rent, mortgages, health insurance, and auto loans need something more than “be patient while we take 10 years to build this bridge”  > instead insinuates Trump's failings are just a continuation of Biden's policies  It’s explicitly referring to their messaging, not their policies.",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T10:03:09,1
"That's not true at all. If anything, their economic message was drowned out by people complaining about the social issues, exactly like what you're doing bringing up the ""JOY"" thing.   You simply weren't/aren't aware of it. That's partly their fault, but partly your own.  People *wanted* to punish the Biden administration for everything, so they came up with ridiculous things like ""They keep focussing entirely on this LGBTQ shit!"", which simply wasn't true. It was *part* of their social message, sure, but it's not like its all they talked about.  The ultimate problem is people had to *work* to find the true messages being put out by the Biden administration/Harris campaign, while it was easy to know exactly where Trump and Republicans stood on things because they flooded the zone with shit and the media covered every criticism they levied towards Biden/Harris every step of the way.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T08:57:31,7
"RTA:  > Even Tim Walz came out criticizing that soft approach, saying the campaign should’ve been direct about the cost of living issues. That follows on what aides had been saying to the press too about a lack of decisive leadership as all kinds of corporate consultants came in. That’s why the “weird” and “couch fucking” trends died so abruptly.  And on this point, you're absolutely correct. The Harris campaign thought it should stay away from the mud slinging, maybe so that they could stand a better chance of getting their message out. But, that is where they royally fucked up.   The left was sick and tired of Trump, Republicans, and conservatives in general, constantly bitching and complaining about everything, without backing any of it up with solid ideas, and wanted to see the Democrats finally get down in the mud pit and give them a taste of their own medicine; one or two good public humiliations of Trump and he would have self-destructed, like all weak-willed insecure bullies do.  So, rather than rallying their base around finally taking these assholes to task, they stuck with the same old high road nonsense that keeps proving itself to be a failing strategy.",Acrobatic-Trouble181,2025-05-07T09:11:21,2
"> If anything, their economic message was drowned out by people complaining about the social issues, exactly like what you're doing bringing up the ""JOY"" thing.  There are so many things wrong with this lol  First the election is over. No one is drowning anyone out anymore. You’re actually supposed to reflect on a loss and find the reasons why.   Second “JOY” is not a social issue. It was a campaign strategy, and it’s fair to criticize for not being good messaging. It was fair to then, and it definitely is now that we have empirical evidence that it failed.   Third Harris was asked directly multiple times what she would do differently than Biden and she never had a clear answer. She literally just said “I’m not Biden and I’m not Trump”. She didn’t even have an economic message she could reliably spit out the way Trump just rants about immigrants and trade.   > People wanted to punish the Biden administration for everything, so they came up with ridiculous things like ""They keep focussing entirely on this LGBTQ shit!""  The Trump campaign spent $200m on ads arguing that point.   Meanwhile the Harris campaign stayed silent so they neither defended themselves on the social issues nor pushed an effective economic message people could pay attention to. They actively refused to run their top performing ads talking about the cost of living. That is 100% their fault no matter what everyone else was doing.  > people had to work to find the true messages being put out by the Biden administration/Harris campaign  Unions and community organizers repeatedly said the campaign’s economic goals didn’t seem clear to voters when they were canvassing. There was even reporting of rogue canvassing groups because the campaign wasn’t taking any feedback from them. From Bernie Sanders to super PACs, **everyone** was telling the campaign they didn’t have a clear strong economic message that addressed people’s concerns. Many of us who have a research background went through the 80-page pamphlet she put out and it really didn’t paint a clear picture of her overall vision. Just some incremental reforms across the board, some good and some bad. It was hard to argue *for* her and not just against Trump.  This was so incompetent that we should really be arguing if it’s deliberate self-sabotage. Instead of paying attention to people on the ground, she hired consultants who were helping Google and Uber fight the Biden DOJ, and we never talk about that…",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T09:17:38,0
"Sigh ... you've just reiterated my point several times, repeatedly making the assertion that they were 'staying silent' when in reality they were 'being drowned out', and your insistence is now so bad you're leaping towards incompetence and/or conspiracy theories to explain it?

"> you've just reiterated my point several times, repeatedly making the assertion that they were 'staying silent' when in reality they were 'being drowned out'   I’ve reiterated your point…. by saying the exact opposite thing as you?   If you’re going to ignore the mountain of evidence that supports my point, can you at least come up with something better than “your evidence is actually my evidence” lmao  > your insistence is now so bad you're leaping towards incompetence and/or conspiracy theories to explain it?  You think the idea that a political campaign suffered from incompetence is as silly as a conspiracy theory? We’re rapidly heading into MAGA-like cult behavior with how deeply some of you defend politicians…  It is a *fact* that Harris’ campaign had consultants who worked for Google and Uber. Specifically her brother-in-law, who is the chief legal counsel for Uber. She also had private dinners with CEOs of companies like Visa that the Biden DOJ had antitrust cases against, but she refused to comment when asked if it had anything to do with the case.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/29/tony-west-kamala-harris-uber-campaign/  This was covered in mainstream reporting, even if you weren’t paying attention.  These are facts. You can say you don’t think they matter and that’s fine but to say it’s a conspiracy theory is just reflexive cult behavior. Anything that disagrees with you must be a conspiracy out to get you…",Prior_Coyote_4376,2025-05-07T10:10:53,1
