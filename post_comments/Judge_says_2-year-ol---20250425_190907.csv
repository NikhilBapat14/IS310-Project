">The child, whose redacted U.S. birth certificate was filed in court and showed she was born in New Orleans in 2023, had been with her mother and sister during a regular immigration check-in at the New Orleans office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday. Officials there detained them and queued them up for deportation.  >Trump administration officials said in court that the mother told ICE officials that she wished to take V.M.L. with her to Honduras. The filing included a handwritten note in Spanish they claimed was written by the mother and confirmed her intent. But the judge said he had hoped to verify that information.  >“The Government contends that this is all okay because the mother wishes that the child be deported with her,” Doughty wrote. “But the Court doesn’t know that.”  Fuck Trump, fuck the GOP, and fuck anyone that supports this insanity.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-25T19:11:55,9225
">The judge on Friday scheduled a hearing for May 16, which he said was “in the interest of dispelling our strong suspicion that the Government just deported a U.S. citizen with no meaningful process.”  May 16th is too far in the future.

"The Trump admin immigration officials also did something similar when they deported a ten year old U.S. citizen with brain cancer under threat of separating her from her relatives.  Keep in mind that the judge in this case with the 2 year old is a conservative Trump appointee, which probably won't stop Trump supporters from labeling him a ""radical leftist.""  > According to court papers, the 2-year-old girl had accompanied her mother, Jenny Carolina Lopez Villela, and her older sister, Valeria, to an immigration appointment in New Orleans on Tuesday when they were taken into custody by officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  So immigration officials decided to detain this little girl without any consideration for her rights, and apparently without any knowledge of her situation.   Oh ya, and the mother isn't even the girl's custodian...   > In a petition filed by the child’s custodian, Trish Mack, on Thursday, her father claimed that when he spoke briefly with Ms. Lopez Villela, he could hear her and the children crying. The father reminded her, the petition said, that “their daughter was a U.S. citizen and could not be deported.”  The petition said:  > The detention of V.M.L. “is without any basis in law and violates her fundamental due process rights,” the petition said. “She seeks this court’s urgent action and asks the court to order her immediate release to her custodian Trish Mack, who is ready and waiting to take her home.”  The Trump administration is just rounding up whomever they please, and without any regard for the unconstitutionality of their actions.  Just like they did with Kilmar Garcia, with a kid with cancer and with hundreds of Venezuelan migrants who were denied due process. Just like they've done with hundreds of other ""undesirables""—many with no criminal records—that they've been shipping in and out of Guantanamo bay; like they've done with legal residents, foreign students, visa and green card holders, veterans, protestors and U.S. citizens.   Just like they've done with asylum seekers, and foreigners who are literally hours away from obtaining their citizenship status. Just like they've done with foreign workers residing in the US legally, like they've done with supposed ""gang members"" who have no actual ties to gangs. Just like they've done to migrants who have court hearings or are physically in court, like they've done with many others who have been denied their rights, stripped of their legal status, and/or permanently prohibited from accessing any avenues citizenship in the future...

"The good Christians of MAGA are doing exactly what their Jesus wants, deporting toddlers. This is an official act of Christianity. MAGA is a deeply Christian movement and claims to be the vanguard of the Christian faith. They are all behaving as Christians. Don't kid yourself about this not being a religious act. All of Christianity owns this. Those Christians who stayed quiet to get along with their MAGA neighbors are especially culpable. I know this may be the actual majority of American Christians because the Go Woke = Go Broke movement has been very successful in targeting inclusive churches, even in the blue states. All of you own this. The cross is the symbol of deporting toddlers with cancer. YOUR cross stands for this moment. Look in the mirror. What did you do to stop this? Fuckall is what you did because it happened. Fuckall is what you will do because you are afraid. Fuck your fear: you are getting toddlers deported. Your silence is your assent. It is on your soul.

"As a conservative, I fully support strong, lawful immigration enforcement.  That being said, deporting a US citizen child without clear due process is absolutely unacceptable. Citizenship is not a technicality, but the foundation of our republic.  If the reports about ICE deporting a 2-year-old American citizen without proper legal process are accurate, then it deserves real accountability.  Conservatives should never excuse government overreach just because it fits a partisan narrative. We are supposed to stand for constitutional rights, equal protection under the law, and individual sovereignty. That includes the rights of every American citizen, no matter how small. I hope other conservatives will stand up on this one.  Supporting immigration enforcement does not mean supporting government agencies violating citizenship rights. That’s the difference between being a real conservative and just cheering for the party no matter what.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.""  -Methodist Pastor David Barnhart",SanityRecalled,2025-04-26T14:00:04,6
"That's only half of it. The evangelical project is to divest government funds from social support structures so that faith-backed efforts (which can have far more strings attached) will be much more relied on. This can be used to foster economic dependence, which can be leveraged for social control. Look at how missionary work has been used abroad, the way those resources are used to exert pressure on the populations aided by it, and know they will attempt to import that.   It's a way to do things like shove queer people back into the closet, or pressure them about their faith, or nudge support for certain political outlooks, without entirely relying on direct force. It's a way to look like the good guy while doing it. I was raised in this milieu, I know the gameplan.",AdrianBrony,2025-04-26T12:20:07,2

I need to make this extremely clear. If we allow deportations without due process, even for gang members, even for murderers, or even for children of deportees who want their children with them, there is nothing to prevent a future Democratic administration from simply labeling Republicans they don't like ""foreign gang members"" or ""foreign terrorists"" and sending them off to a foreign prison before their families have time to challenge it in court.",Dragnil,2025-04-26T12:20:01,2

The citizen child was kidnapped by ICE against the wishes of the citizen father then forced onto an aircraft with the mother and sent out of the country before being released onto the street in a foreign country where that child has no birth certificate.

Seeking the path of least resistance, the Court called counsel for the Government at 12:19 p.m. CST, so that we could speak with VML’s mother and survey her consent and custodial rights. The Court was independently aware at the time that the plane, tail number N570TA, was above the Gulf of America. The Court was then called back by counsel for the Government at 1:06 p.m. CST, informing the Court that a call with VML’s mother would not be possible, because she (and presumably VML) had just been released in Honduras.",Cat_herder_81,2025-04-25T19:58:36,12

"The child was deported. The father was specifically prevented from getting his kid from ICE custody.   And tell me, how exactly would a 2 year old American citizen get back to America? On a plane? Who buys the plane ticket? Who accompanies the 2 year old child since no airline will accept an unaccompanied 2 year old child for the return flight. How does the girl prove she's an American citizen while she's down there? Her birth certificate is up here. Will the US government facilitate the return of this little American girl? Trump and his goons have a solid history of not letting anyone return to this country regardless of what judges say.   Tell me, what agency does this little 2 year old American toddler have?  Honduras isn't the paradise you pretend it is:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Honduras  There are places in Honduras where rich people have enclaves and live nice lives. This girl isn't in any of these enclaves. Not only that, because she's not a citizen of Honduras she can't even use any of the few social programs there. Theoretically her mom can apply for citizenship for that American toddler, but that will require the little girl to revoke her US citizenship since Honduras doesn't allow dual nationality. Though it would seem that dual citizenship is allowed for certain birthright citizens, the reality is that it's an expensive process that often fails.  To put it bluntly, that little girl belongs here in America with her father, and ICE deporting her was a gross violation of the Constitution.

"Does the father have a legal status in the US? A 2 year old American citizen could get back to the US pretty easily with some support. The mother could arrange for a family member or friend in the US to take custody of the child. This person could fly to Honduras then fly back with the child. This is pretty common. They could also wait until the child is 7 to send her on a plane to live with a guardian. She’s a US citizen so she can’t be denied entry into the US. If the father has status (which I doubt as this article didn’t mention it), the child can be brought back for less than 500 dollars on the right weekend.  If you read this very article (literally the one we’re commenting on) you’d know they presented copies of this child’s birth certificate in court. There’s a record of this child already. If arrangements are made, the child can be brought back easily.  Now I’ve been to Honduras. You haven’t. Sure Honduras is dangerous in some areas but all in all it’s a very beautiful and peaceful country outside of those areas. Plenty of people grow old in Honduras and live happy lives. The idea that South/Central American countries are wholly gang infested and unlivable is ridiculous. Get a passport and actually visit these places. And not just the resorts. The US isn’t the only habitable country in the world. Get out there and talk to real people and you’ll realize that good lives can be lived in Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Bolivia, wherever.

We had protection armor SWAT guys but they were supposed to be specifically for armed hostage conflicts, like the 1975 movie ""Dog Day Afternoon"" but even then SWAT was controversial, but it seemed more reasonable to have a really elite squad that could deal with ultra extreme hostage situations.  And we all knew that they were escalating to using them way more often but what I meant when I said ""that photo was the warning we had"" was that it was inconceivable that they had sent guys like that into a house of what they knew was unarmed civilians, the child's goddamn family IDGAF if his Daddy technically had ""custody"" and the right to extradite him, the child was with his mother's family and they could have FUCKING WAITED or if they weren't going to wait they could have just sent normal police through the door, there was no reason, justification or excuse to terrorize that child and those folks that way  Jesus they weren't going anywhere they would have given him up eventually.  IT WAS A GODDAMN CUSTODY DISPUTE NOT A BUNCH OF DANGEROUS VIOLENT CRIMINALS NOR DID THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS A THREAT.  So that photo was fucking SHOCKING.

How is what the rest of the world does relevant to what we do? Should it apply in all facets or just the ones you agree with?  The rest of the world has a very different idea regarding the right of the people to keep and bear arms. Should the rest of the world's position on gun rights dictate ours?  I would certainly disagree with that just as I disagree with the notion that other countries' restrictive immigration policies should influence ours.,mrgreengenes42,2025-04-26T14:01:54,1
That's a fuckin' lot of supposition and absolutely zero evidence. I am thinking logically. I'm thinking that if you want to accuse someone of something YOU FUCKING PROVE IT. And I'm thinking you will not be able to.,-jp-,2025-04-25T22:01:47,4

"There are ways people in the US illegally can normalize their status, and Congress could expand the pathways to do that. The primary roadblock though is by allowing masses of people in the US illegally to gain citizenship, you encourage even more masses of people to enter the US illegally. This goes against the general bi-partisan support for reducing illegal immigration rather than increasing it.   There is probably more support for expanding immigration for people willing to follow the legal process from the beginning, which could reduce the incentive to enter illegally. But realistically the US is the wealthiest country on earth, the majority of the world's population would become US citizens if they could which is obviously impractical, so demand will always vastly exceed supply.",midnightcaptain,2025-04-26T18:19:26,1
"That's not possible for people born in the US as in this case without retroactively overturning the 14th amendment, which isn't likely.   It's potentially a different situation for naturalized citizens though, there is a process where they can lose their citizenship and be deported, if their citizenship was obtained fraudulently. This is currently quite rare, maybe 25 cases a year. But there is concern the Trump administration could abuse this process by coming up with creative interpretations of ""fraud"". They'd sill have to get each case past a federal judge though.   While that is a legitimate concern, as is the potential Trump could just start ignoring the law and the courts completely and illegally deport whoever he wants, or just have them shot, it's not relevant to the legalities of this case.",midnightcaptain,2025-04-26T19:14:41,1

"That would likely be a crime under 8 U.S.C. § 1324:  >knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of law, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any place, including any building or any means of transportation.  Probably not the wisest thing to publicly admit intent online. But, if you're willing to risk years in prison for a cause you genuinely believe in then I think that's very admirable, even if I don't agree.",midnightcaptain,2025-04-26T18:47:13,1
"Conservatives lose their minds at the very idea of an ""illegal gun"", just as progressives lose their minds at the concept of an ""illegal immigrant"", so yes.
