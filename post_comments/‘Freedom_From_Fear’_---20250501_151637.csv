"Anna Eleanor Roosevelt writes in a letter to The Times:  >In his first 100 days in office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, my grandfather, encouraged us to believe in ourselves, to trust and help our neighbors, and to put the country’s stability and well-being as a whole at the forefront.  >By contrast, the current administration has caused economic chaos at home and abroad, while exhibiting carelessness and cruelty to nearly everyone except billionaires. The early success of a presidential agenda should be defined by what it creates and not by what it destroys — the confidence in the American promise that it inspires, not the fear it sows.

"You see, when MAGA crowd being ""well is just 100 days, gonna give him time"".   FDR was literally in the middle of great depression, and in his first 100 days he have done a lot and people approved of him. He is the one that coined ""100 days"" of a presidency.   100 days is not long, but at the same time if any policy is working, 100 days is long enough to at least see some positive/negative changes.",nasorrty346tfrgser,2025-05-01T15:36:58,5
"Trump probably looks down on FDR because he was physically disabled, having being paralysed from the waist down through polio.  By contrast, Trump's disability is simply the total lack of a functioning moral compass.",crazybones,2025-05-01T15:44:59,3
We need more Roosevelts in the White House. We're 2 for 2.,RockVonCleveland,2025-05-01T19:42:20,1
"It's interesting comparing the two.  Trump demands respect, while FDR was given respect.",Weekly-Trash-272,2025-05-01T15:33:29,3
