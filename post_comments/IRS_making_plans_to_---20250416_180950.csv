"Good, now do churches and charities who violate their 501(c)3 requirements.",Adras7us_,2025-04-16T20:17:30,685
"Churches are charities. That's their claim to tax exempt status. They don't charge for their services.   BUT.   I'm still very wary of this because of the permissions it sets up for the left.   Many churches are barely able to operate these days. If the left comes after their tax exempt status, however unfairly, they will collapse in a cascade.   This might be the right's Harry Reid nuclear moment.   Don't set in motion something you won't like the other side doing back to us.   Harvard is a slimy institution who shouldn't be able to violate the civil rights law that everyone else has to follow. Go after them for that. Not on this too.   That's just my 2 cents, as a nervous Catholic.",Trussed_Up,2025-04-16T20:17:54,124
"""(CNN) — The Internal Revenue Service is making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, according to two sources familiar with the matter, which would be an extraordinary step of retaliation as the Trump administration seeks to turn up pressure on the university that has defied its demands to change its hiring and other practices.""",Ironman650,2025-04-16T18:10:33,25
Sounds warranted.  Good for them.  Why should a private school like Harvard be tax exempt in the first place?,SonnyC_50,2025-04-16T18:23:25,28
"Wow, brigadiers in full effect on this post.  Voting is wonky.",cofcof420,2025-04-17T06:34:18,5
And the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is absolutely conflicted about this.  BAD: Harvard takes a hit and this fuels their TDS even more.  GOOD: The Commonwealth and Cities of Cambridge and Boston stand to gain millions per year in tax revenue.,WIlf_Brim,2025-04-16T19:40:25,-3
Yes they should pay their fair share.  Their 52 billion endowment is the largest in the world.,Pinot_Greasio,2025-04-16T18:25:00,-39
"Good, go after the other 99% of universities pushing the liberal agenda next too.",BecauseTheTruthHurts,2025-04-16T20:58:24,-31
"I'm good with churches. I think that they should remove the 60% cap for charitable contribution write offs for them, though.",alivenotdead1,2025-04-16T21:50:36,-72
"I agree with Adras7us, but not because of religious reasons, YHWH is still our Father, review all 501 c 3’s!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-17T02:13:31,-21
lmao no shot you’re a real conservative   Why is this sub getting so brigaded lately? In what world is “end tax free churches” the top comment in a conservative sub?,Running_Gamer,2025-04-16T21:08:38,-204
"The bit of security the Catholic Church has is the fact it has the resources to fight for as long as it wants. That said, you’re right about the potential for retaliation. I’d be more worried about what the response will be to the left coming after churches though. That’s the sort of thing that starts religious wars.",deadzip10,2025-04-17T00:55:57,11
"Removing Harvard’s tax exempt status is the correct, legal, and moral thing to do. If you start turning a blind eye out of concern that the left might do the wrong and immoral thing in return then the fight is already over. I’m not Catholic, but as a fellow Christian, I have faith that the church can and will survive whatever earthly schemes are brought against it. The tax exemption is good, but it’s not what keeps my church afloat. I owe that to God and the people who attend my church. _They_ are the actual church. So, take heart, find your resolve, and know that God is bigger than our human problems.",CamoAnimal,2025-04-16T23:08:09,-13
"Because they're registered as a nonprofit. Most nonprofits are private. Private vs public has nothing to do with tax exemption.   Talking out loud here...    The existence of private nonprofits and their tax-exempt status are very in line with conservativism —as long as the nonprofits stick to their charitable or educational missions and stay out of partisan politics. The idea is that they’re filling roles the government shouldn’t be involved in—local community help, faith-based support, etc.—and taxing them would just hurt the very people they're trying to serve (individuals want to donate to causes they care about without worrying about inefficient govt distribution). But if they start acting like political action arms or fronts for shady lobbying, yank the exemption.",findunk,2025-04-16T18:33:11,215
"He said churches that violate the rules, not all churches. I love my church, but they don’t deserve tax exemption if they’re skirting the rules.",TBoneTheOriginal,2025-04-17T08:33:57,19

"Because churches should be a place to worship God and enrich a community with good works. It’s not a political soapbox. You want to be a political lobby, great, pay the tax, don’t use God to save a buck. If politics enter the sermon, I can’t support that.",RontoWraps,2025-04-16T21:40:25,286
"Because they added the important ""not following the requirements line"" and is just asking for a fair outcome.",spezeditedcomments,2025-04-16T21:20:15,123
I’m not a conservative because I’m advocating for equal application of the law?,Adras7us_,2025-04-19T20:42:00,3
"My church is a small church. (Fewer than 50 members) We would go upside down and have to shut our doors if we lost our exemption status.   However, if that’s what is needed to defeat the left, then so be it. We will start meeting in homes like they did in the Church Age.",Echoes-OTI,2025-04-17T06:10:48,-7
"Saying ""harvard should pay it's fair share because it's private"" sounds like a leftist ""lets tax the rich"" argument. You need a reason to revoke their 501c3 status first.",findunk,2025-04-16T18:35:31,134
"This right here. You are correct. Harvard is on the surface in violation but they could easily get off on a technicality, “we never officially sanctioned such and such action”.  Everyone knows it’s bs, just like everyone knows corporations use (not abuse, save dishonesty) the tax code to avoid paying more than they have to. It’s politicians and the government in general that is to blame. They allow this behavior because they get favors and contributions while skirting the laws they swore to uphold but blatantly abandon. They serve foreign interests and not their constituency. According to our laws, that is treason.",Adras7us_,2025-04-16T20:22:42,13
Political action?  Sounds a lot like Harvard.,SonnyC_50,2025-04-16T18:37:31,-27
"They have a reason and they told them to correct it, Harvard said no.  It is not an entitlement.",Lifeisagreatteacher,2025-04-16T20:05:00,-53
"I just know that if it is done, we are 1 liberal president from all churches losing exempt status based on ""touting"" conservative principles such as right to life and sanctity of marriage.   Slippery slope fallacy or not.",Dumachus156984,2025-04-16T21:40:20,40
"Yeah it's fine to make the arguments if it's based on their politics, but you have to center it around revoking 501c3 status, not that they're private. ",findunk,2025-04-16T18:39:08,23
