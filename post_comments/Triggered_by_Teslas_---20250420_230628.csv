">The therapist, who works with children, immediately reverted to one of her clients and blamed others for her actions.  ""*A man who remains a child is the most frightening thing in the world.*"" - Agatha Christy   (...and a woman who remains a child is no less frightening.)  This is it, isn't it? Giant toddlers who throw giant, destructive temper tantrums.",Farmwife64,2025-04-21T06:15:15,23
"The standard practice of evil by humans always has them blaming somebody else when and IF they acknowledge they are doing evil.    To those who don’t admit they do evil and therefore do not blame others for their behavior, to those are called Psychopaths and/or Sociopaths and do not let Hollywood fool you with examples through their movies, Psychopaths  and sociopaths can often times “appear” normal but “normal” is subjective. They are narcissistic by nature, have little empathy and they desire to manipulate you in any shape, manner or form they can and then you are snagged.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-21T00:19:00,16
"My father is a retired psychiatric nursing director. He was in charge of the biggest psych ward in Chicago. He has met with many psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, therapists, etc. He loved his work, and he loved the science of psychology.  Presently, he is totally disgusted with where the science of psychology is going, in what therapists and psychologists are doing with the practice. He believes that most therapists need to be admitted themselves.",bjohn15151515,2025-04-21T06:20:05,13
"The three stages of leftist denial.  ""it isn't happening""  ""Ok it is happening, but it's not as bad as you say""  ""Ok it is happening, and it is as bad as you say, but it's not happening a lot""  ""Ok it is happening, and it is as bad as you say, and it is happening a lot... But here's why you deserve it""  The left has not changed their playbook for over a decade; nobody should be surprised at this point.",Shadeylark,2025-04-21T08:07:57,14
"Funny, the same excuse favored by domestic abusers, rapists, and other defective individuals incapable of either self-control or taking responsibility for their own actions.",JustinCayce,2025-04-21T18:42:15,1
