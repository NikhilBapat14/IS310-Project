It won't stand. Doesnt matter which side actually breaks the ceasefire first they'll blame each other and nothing will change. The only way it'll stay intact is if one side does like the french did to neutral Belgium in 1914 and pull back 10 miles away from the line to prevent any interaction that may cause blame for the breaking of a pact. ,cledus1667,2025-04-28T10:20:15,50

"If, without a ceasefire, bullets fly 100% of the time, and with a poorly observed ceasefire, bullets fly 70% of the time, which is better?
