"Who is surprised? They are evaluating ABC, CBS, NBC which are Democrat platforms. If anything, I'm surprised it's not 100% negative. These are not actual news organizations but propaganda machines for the Democrat party.",RandolphE6,2025-04-28T16:43:39,60
"the entire MSM is just a democrat propaganda machine, anyone who thinks otherwise are just naive or brainwashed.",Chikaze,2025-04-29T10:02:43,4

"There's so much evidence of MSM being an extension of the Democrat party.  Off the top of my head:  1. The 60 Minutes Kamala interview edit   2. Trump being lambasted for his blue suit at the Pope's funeral despite many other people also wearing blue.   3. ""Very fine people on both sides""  One of the defining traits of fascism is:  ""A controlled mass media""  Democrats will never understand they are exactly what they proclaim Conservatives to be.",ObjectiveJackfruit35,2025-04-28T17:12:32,36
"Those networks are all left-leaning, but they're not really loyal to the Democratic party. Nor are any of them as biased as MSNBC. That's the real propaganda machine.  There is a crisis of left bias in American mainstream news media, but it's mainly because of the lack of reliable right-leaning counterparts to networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC. Fox is like the right's version of MSNBC. IMHO both are too unreliable for me. I would love to see someone create things that are, for the right, more like ABC, CBS, and NBC are for the left, but I don't think they currently exist in the US.  There is lots of reliable right-leaning media out there but it's mostly print publications, not cable TV networks. There are regional newspapers, think tanks, all sorts of great websites. If you go on Media Bias / Fact Check and use their filtered search, select ""center-right"" and ""High"" for Factual Reporting, you get a pleasantly long list and honestly I like nearly every publication on that list. But even there, there is still a left bias in that there are far more left-leaning regional newspapers than right-leaning ones.  The problem though is that people aren't reading or subscribing to the high-quality right-leaning sources, so they go out of business. I saw this in my hometown, when I was young it had a right-leaning and a left-leaning paper. They were pretty balanced in terms of their political leaning, and they offered a good counterpart to each other. My household subscribed to the right-leaning one growing up and it stayed open through my time in high school. Somewhere along the line though, it closed, and only the left-leaning paper continued. It had more paying subscribers, so it was the one that stayed open. The media will always follow the money.  Not quite sure what can be done to fix this problem. I'm still reading and engaging with this type of media, but I don't think there are a lot of people like me left who want media like this. Most people on the right just get their news from places like Fox, or worse, OAN or NewsMax. That would be like if liberals only subscribed to MSNBC or Huffpo, and not only stuff like ABC, CBS, and NBC didn't exist, but more than that, if 90% of stuff like NY Times, Philadelphia Inquirer, LA Times, or Cleveland Plain Dealer didn't exist either. This is what has happened to right-leaning media in the US.",cazort2,2025-04-28T17:27:24,11
Don't forget the leaked tapes of producers talking about how they are just a Democrat arm and broadcast whatever the Democrat message is for the day and laugh about how they make the American public stupider. Democrats don't understand because they are not intelligent enough to see through their own stupidity.,RandolphE6,2025-04-28T17:18:58,19
