"> “Daily Show” correspondent Michael Kosta roasted Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday over her bold claim that Donald Trump saved the lives of 258 million Americans due to fentanyl seizures since the start of his second term  > Kosta noted that Bondi’s “outrageous” claim sprouted up Monday on Fox News when she credited the Drug Enforcement Administration for seizing 21 million fentanyl-laced pills, which she believed saved 21 million lives as a result.  >Kosta, who joked about the figure being way off from the number of annual deaths due to fentanyl, then turned to a clip where Bondi “corrected herself” two days later on Fox News.  >“Since he’s been in office, DEA has taken 22.2 million fentanyl pills off the streets,” she claimed. “This is 119 million lives Donald Trump has saved since January. Pretty remarkable.”  Stupid as fuck, just like the rest of the administration",MothersMiIk,2025-05-02T02:41:31,262

They're not talking to people with critical thinking skills.  Bondi wasn't being stupid - it was deliberate.  Trump supporters will only remember that Trump saved millions and millions of people in the first 100 days and the GOP will be praising him for it all over their media.,Independent_Tie_4984,2025-05-02T06:10:21,64

"Here's a little exercise to ask Pam:   Last year, Americans drank 4.5 liters of wine per person, on average.   Not everyone of course, and not all in one sitting of course, but averaged out over all americans and over the whole year.   As it turns out, that's crudely estimated to be just about what it takes to kill a person :  5 liters of wine, but you gotta drink it inside an hour.  [source](https://www.northstarbehavioralhealthmn.com/resources/how-much-alcohol-can-kill-you). (yes lots of variables there, but we are doing ballpark math here)   So if we use Bondi's math as applied to fentanyl,  **everyone in america died last year of alcohol poisoning just from wine.**     Let's not even talk about beer and spirits.    So explain this, PAM:  how are any of us still alive?",mjc4y,2025-05-02T07:49:45,14

"In a different article it made it even worse where the DOJ actually responded and tried to justify it. The math was: total fentanyl seizures since January / lethal dose of fentanyl = # of certain deaths averted.   So, had it not been seized, it would have been equally divided into 258 million lethal doses, and distributed nationwide to people who would have all gotten their fentanyl pill in the mail I guess, and all just shrugged, eaten it, and dropped dead That’s what she’s saying didn’t happen only by the miraculous intervention of Donald Fucking Trump. ",clickmagnet,2025-05-02T06:50:49,95
