Wouldn't be the first time in US history that NC destroyed democracy.,L_obsoleta,2025-05-01T14:33:57,7
"They have been warned for like 4 years or more about this. The Republicans have shown they are not going to let go of power willingly and are willing to do what it takes including disregarding the rule of law and making people ""disappear"". We might even see people from the opposition and protesters disapearing in the next 3-4 years.  In short get used to the US being a fascist dictatorship if the US citizens and courts don't start getting their game together now!",Erikblod,2025-05-01T14:56:59,8
You think the Cons give a shit about court decisions? They are a lawless collective of thugs and assholes hellbent on ransacking the nation for their own personal gain.,LW_GLAZER,2025-05-01T13:47:27,12

"Yeah. I keep hoping for ""norms and traditions"" to work their influence, but what's the point?  NC Republicans seem like especially awful people.",Moonspindrift,2025-05-01T13:50:56,2
