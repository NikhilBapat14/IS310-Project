"5k doesn’t even cover birth costs.   How about address the cost of daycare (Trump had no answer for that at the debate while Harris did), food, housing, low wages, and the sorry state of public education?",rottenavocadotoast,2025-04-23T18:17:10,45

"fuck trump and maga   how about addressing the real reasons people dont have children?   \-if something goes wrong with the pregnancy and it needs to be terminated is the mother going to have to die to appease the crazy base?  why would anyone want to risk this  \- health insurance sucks even for those of us lucky enough to have it and even then it can be incredibly costly.  why not support healthcare for all and i bet the birth rates would go up...  \- shitty jobs with even shittier pay.  go to college and get a worthless degree and pay for it for decades, dont go to college and good luck with those jobs and raising a family.   \- fair taxes - why the fuck does a secretary pay more percentage-wise than the ceo? tax those billionaires and set up some real safety nets for potential parents  \-enviroment - we just stopped testing milk in the US for some hazards, maga idiots rolling back safety regs on EVERYTHING - power plants, water, food, etc etc.  who dies when that shit gets out into the world?  the vulnerable and the last i checked infants fall into that catergory  in conclusion - just more nazi bullshit from maga blowhards about the replacement hoax conspiracy  fuck trump and maga  fuck putin and musk  fuck the ignorant hucklefucks who voted for him",AngryTomJoad,2025-04-23T18:28:35,17

Putin probably suggested this at their last meeting.  Russia has been doing this experiment with their population. Not having bodies is bad for the military. The bonuses will probably dry up once they figure out how to utilize AI in a way that sustains the economy and military without the peons. Remember how we started a trade war with everyone for no reason? What happens when we start a hot war for no reason? Will the impeachment work a third time? Can we please take elections seriously next time if we get the chance? Not treating politics like following your favorite sports team would be cool too.

Did you mean the co-pay is more than 5k?  Or only if you don't have insurance?  At the current tariffs the dollar may tank fast enough for the 5k not to cover the co-pay.  Oh well.,thieh,2025-04-23T18:22:33,3

At a very base level kids are a way to shackle people's freedom with an expensive responsibility. Costs are never going to fix birth rates you need to find a way for people to have kids they need to make it easier to raise them and for women not to be stigmatized for having and or not having them as well.  Stuff like accessible 24 hours daycare so parents have it easier to find time for themselves and stricter rules regarding promotion and hiring practices towards pregnant women.   Money is an issue but what you lose for having kids is a major problem in society. There are very few benefits for women to have children outside of wanting them.,kuriboharmy,2025-04-23T18:51:50,5
