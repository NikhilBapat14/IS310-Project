"You are mixing things up that need correction before your questions can be answered.  Russia (all their crimes aside) is *not* executing their returned PoWs. The Wagner Group does it, which is 1. *not* officially a part of the Russian Army and 2. is technically an illegal organization even by Russian law. Now, the fact that they are still around and are involved with the Russian Army is a wholly different thing. However, members of the Wagner Group are not considered combatants by international law and as such are not accorded the same protections and rights as ""proper"" PoWs. Prisoner exchanges of Wagner members are also negotiated between Ukraine and the Wagner Group, not Ukraine and Russia, while prisoner exchanges of Russian soldiers actually happen between Ukraine and Russia. As far as the international community is aware, Ukraine is treating both groups (Russian Pows and Wagner members) the same.  In Nuzhin's case, it is unclear whether he ultimately agreed to be returned or not, but there certainly was no way to know what would happen to him. There are varying stories out there. But generally, obtaining a signed agreement from the PoW to be exchanged is a good practise and Ukrainian officials claim to have obtained a written agreement from Nuzhin.  Reportedly, Wagner expressed a wish to exchange Nuzhin for twenty Ukrainian PoW after Nuzhin gave interviews (while in capticity) where he slandered Putin and claimed to regret joining Wagner. However, considering Nuzhin's shady past (he was serving a sentence for murder when he was recruited into Wagner), many people were not buying it. There was no way to know whether he was being genuine, hence the question (after the fact) whether he singned an agreement to be exchanged ot not.  Now here's the thing: each state is first and foremost responsible for the wellbeing of its citizens, both legally and morally. You'd think that Russia would be interested in returning their own citizens safely. We know that's not... quite... the case, but as far as we are aware, Russia itself is ""simply"" being negligent in trying to return its citizens, rather than actively harming them once they're returned (other than potentially sending them back to the frontlines). By that same logic, Ukraine's main goal in the exchange is (rightfully) returning its own citizens home. Considering that Russian PoWs have, at least in theory, the opportunity to refuse the exchange, one can assume that any that are exchanged have agreed to it, which ultimately absolves Ukraine of whatever happens afterwards (of course, no way for us to be 100% sure in every single case). By that same logic, anyone who has agreed to be returned to the Wagner Group, well... I guess they could apply for asylum if particularly desperate, however anyone who is a member of the Wagner Group is by definition a criminal under international law since the Wagner Group is an illegal organization, making their chances rather slim.",Aranict,2023-03-04T14:59:20,14
"Under [the Geneva Conventions](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/en/ihl-treaties/gciii-1949), there is an assumption that combatants wish to be repatriated to their home country, and a duty imposed on former belligerents to do so. If a combatant does not want to be repatriated, they will ask for asylum, and this becomes a negotiation.  A good example of this in history would be [Operation Keelhaul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Keelhaul), where former anti-communists (to include Russian members of the Waffen-SS) were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union after World War II, where they faced various criminal charges and punishments. However, during that same period, some were shielded by the British government by offering them asylum, which the Soviet government objected to.  In a modern case, it would be a similar situation: does the Russian national not wish to return, and does Ukraine want to allow them to stay? If both answers were yes, said individual could stay. But Ukraine is under no legal obligation, rather it is the opposite: Ukraine has the duty to repatriate by default.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-03-05T14:46:34,3
I assume that war crimes generally govern  how you treat the other country's troops.  What you do with your own troops is your business.,DoubleLigero85,2023-03-04T08:38:03,4
"No, that is a wrong assumption. War crimes may be committed against your own army, civilian population or their interests. For example, attacking your own soldiers, civilian population may amount to a war crime.  As always, the problem is that neither conflicting party is usually interested in punishing their own army.",ComplicateEverything,2023-03-07T13:06:29,4
"Interesting, thank you for the correction.",DoubleLigero85,2023-03-07T15:35:00,2
"Just to make it clear and detailed. Some old treaties have words that excluded the application of their provisions to your own or allie's army and/or territory. Probably they didn't do intentionally because clearly the first task was to protect your civil population from an occupying nation. However, international humanitarian law developed so it is not longer a case, in treaties after WW2 you may find such phases as ""to whatever nation they belong to"". Besides, there are customs that clearly prohibits that in many cases.  One example of a quite new norm is the prohibition of recruitment of children to take part into hostilities under the age of 18. You cannot abuse your population as you wish!",ComplicateEverything,2023-03-07T17:21:20,4
