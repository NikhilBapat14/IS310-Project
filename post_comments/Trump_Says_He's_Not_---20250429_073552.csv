Trump just says whatever he is thinking at that moment.  It has no relationship to anything and can change in the next second.,Smithy2232,2025-04-29T07:41:00,1
I call bullshit,giga_phantom,2025-04-29T07:39:22,1
Lies.....all lies.  He keeps throwing it out there to test the water.  He and his regime are going to do anything to stay in power.  All you have to do is see what they are doing DAILY to ensure that.,CouchCorrespondent,2025-04-29T07:43:04,1
of course not.  his second term is just not gonna end until he dies.,oldpre,2025-04-29T07:48:11,1
Why would anybody believe this lying idiot?  We’ve put an idiot in charge and let him lie every time he opens his mouth.  A 90 day tariff suspension doesn’t last 10.  Stop taking this criminal seriously.  He isn’t a serious person.,Lochstar,2025-04-29T07:47:48,1

It's because there will be no elections making running redundant,LuinAelin,2025-04-29T07:36:43,1
He won't want another term because he's sinking the country this term. Republicans cause a mess and then require Dems to come in and clean it up. ,therapistofcats,2025-04-29T07:49:08,1
Typical Trump.  He sees people pushing back and so he lies so you go away.  He hasn't changed his mind at all.  He wants you to stop looking.,TintedApostle,2025-04-29T07:58:46,1
I suppose that will depend on the statute of limitations.,specqq,2025-04-29T08:18:49,1

It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to this calling.,COSpaceshipBuilder,2025-04-29T08:25:15,1

"C'mon now, they could rig up some kind of pope-mobile armored mobility scooter with a golden toilet seat for him to move around the golf course while burning what's left of America to the ground.",SamuraiCook,2025-04-29T08:01:38,1
">In an interview with The Atlantic for its June issue, Trump said a 2028 run ""would be a big shattering."" ""Well, maybe I'm just trying to shatter,"" he added.  So a very non-committal “probably not” at best.  What surprises me the most is he is doing at interview with the Atlantic despite the whole Signalgate originated there.",notbobby125,2025-04-29T08:05:16,1
I'm pretty sure this is the first time he's said something like that. He's old and lazy and burned out. I can't wait until this guy is done.,Kid_Charlamagne36,2025-04-29T08:14:24,1
"Of course he isn't ""looking"" to run.  Don't need to look at running if you can just have a hostile take over",Silly_Variety3686,2025-04-29T08:38:23,1
That's because you are going to pull the pin on the grenade that the right was screeching Obama was going to do and declare martial law.,ERedfieldh,2025-04-29T09:06:52,1
I notice you’re using the term *thinking* very loosely here,thisusedyet,2025-04-29T08:14:41,1
"No, he's got a plan, this is all part of the [Trump two-step](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/04/trump-two-step-bloodbath-2024-election/677966/) which he's been using most of his time in office",biscuitarse,2025-04-29T08:08:47,1
The 2028 hats could easily pivot to an Ivanka or Don Jr run,rundmz8668,2025-04-29T07:53:34,1
"Well, that's good to hear! I think two terms is plenty. Time for someone new!",Nervous_Purple4690,2025-04-29T07:51:35,1
"I don’t, man is very lazy. He already beat jail which was his main reason for running the third time. ",Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-29T07:50:16,1
"Let me decode this in Trump speak:  ""I'm not looking to 'run' for a third term in office"" -- *There will be no more elections so there will be no need to ""run"" for a third term*  ""It would be a very hard thing"" -- *I'm too old to go through the rigorous process of campaigning again, so we're going to find a way that I'll be president for life*  He's telling us what's going to happen through his lies.",longarmofthelaw,2025-04-29T08:33:51,1
Exactly he is a serious person. He’s a lazy man who wouldn’t go through the effort of actually trying to do a third term. That’s why he won’t do it. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-04-29T07:50:54,1
"That’s a traaap, a big bold brazen trap by Chyyyna. Look! It says it is made in Chyynaa. Xi stop it! See, how Xi is treating me and our big beautiful magnificient Murica so badly.",Big-Initiative5762,2025-04-29T07:53:58,1
"I wouldn't put it past him to have thrown the third term out there for the merch sales alone. They'll say it's for Junior ultimately. His backers want term limits gone though, they'd have him as a figurehead as long as they think it'll win.",whatareyousomekinda,2025-04-29T08:17:09,1
Very.,Smithy2232,2025-04-29T08:27:01,1
"This seems really plausible. The SCOTUS immunity decision only applies to sitting president and official acts. I don’t know about ivanka, but jr and eric have been up to a lot of shady shit so shooting for presidency could be a real play straight outta dad’s book while maintaining the shitshow sham that is their dynasty.",its-a-baka,2025-04-29T08:04:02,1
