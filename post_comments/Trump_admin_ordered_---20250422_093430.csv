My question is how many foreign student visas are there? Ok so out of that number 133 of those were revoked? I have a sneaking suspicion they were all pro Palestine type protesters.,Bitter-Assignment464,2025-04-22T10:11:58,28

"No. Have a nice day. We can terminate a temporary visa for any reason. Supporting terror organizations makes you ineligable to hold a visa, so supporting them after getting a visa makes you ineligable to remain. Simple as that. They get a chance to leave on their own and not jeopardize their future chances to come to america, but staying and fighting like this will only end in them being permanently barred from legal residence.",ultrainstict,2025-04-22T12:50:19,8

"I'm guessing pro Hamas/Palestine affiliation. I'm not up to date on the terms to which a student visa can be terminated. Advocating for Palestine is different than advocating for Hamas.

"Pro Palestine is fine - they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. You can safely feel bad for them as a people.  Pro Hamas is bullshit, and supporting terrorism is good cause for revoking a visa (with the appropriate due process, whatever that procedure may be).

Might be unpopular but I think even advocating for Hamas should be free speech (and this is from someone who vehemently opposes them).

"Wasn't the argument pretty much ""Had you told us truthfully you would be doing this when you were applying for this visa you wouldn't've gotten it either"", and that's why they're now revoking it?

Advocating for Palestine is objectively NOT different than advocating for Hamas. They put Hamas in power knowing exactly what they were about. Roughly 70% of Palestinians supported the Oct 7th attacks. That's a semantic word game that the left does intentionally so they can have a form of plausible deniability when people call them out for supporting genocidal terrorists. That's actually one of Hamas's strategies is to get simple minded people on the west to play the word game and split hairs.,The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-22T11:19:17,-10

"That's just simply not true. The Palestinain people put Hamas in charge, they aren't innocent victims of some suprise terrorist regime. They fucking elected them knowing the goal was eradication of Israel. Not only that but the *vast* majority of Palestinians approve of the Oct 7 attack. There is a very tiny portion of Palestinian citizens that don't support Hamas and their agenda. The whole ""i support the people not Hamas"" is the game leftist play to avoid having to take responsibility for supporting literal genocide. It's also exact what Hamas wants all the ""useful idiots"" to do .",The_Mighty_Rex,2025-04-22T11:24:04,5
They're on a visa. It can be revoked at any time. They should be on their best behavior. If you're fucking around with this pro hamas shit they should immediately just be sent back.

Advocating for a recognized terrorist organization should be grounds for terminating your visa.  Particularly since we ask if they support terrorist organizations on said visa application.,ObadiahtheSlim,2025-04-22T11:47:51,165

"Student Visas do not entitle you to the same protections as US citizens. If someone came over on a student visa and decided to spend their college days instigating Nazi rallies and disrupting campuses then there is NO reason to allow them to stay in the US.    Again, we aren't talking about US students and citizens here, these are foreigners who are spitting in the face of the country they are in.

"It is free speech. For citizens and immigrants. Guests of this country do not have those protections, and terminating visas is not a criminal punishment.

"Citizens can- if you’re visiting on a visa is it really hard to ask people to be on their best behavior? Aka not openly support and advance the cause of a known violent terrorist org that would wipe away the very country these visitors are in without a second thought if given the chance? No, it’s not a big ask and if you can’t refrain from doing so you should absolutely be sent home.

A lot of people truly believe that Hamas is an occupying force that is not liked in Gaza or the West Bank. They're not evil people, but they do not know much about the conflict and like normal people are predisposed to peace.

But unfortunately, a lot of people do support Hamas unabashedly and see their actions as well justified, like a cornered dog, and equate the IDF to terrorists themselves. That's not to say the IDF is flawless, no army is, but it's an argument (not grounded in fact) that has gone viral among a mostly younger/college-age/TikTok portion of the population. It's also partly why antisemitism has seen a resurgence recently.  To be clear, I don't subscribe to this POV, but that's been what's going on.",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-22T10:29:52,-2

"People will whine even if you express that sentiment about Gaza specifically. Unfortunately it is the truth that Hamas is wildly popular in the Palestinian territories.

You're not wrong about elections in Gaza, they dug their own hole (or, at least, their parents did) electing and perpetually re-electing Hamas.  However, the distinction isn't superficial when you consider the rest of the territory considered Palestine - which is far more land/people/organizations than just the Gaza dumpster fire.

"Lol, ""far more land."" Just say the West Bank. There is nothing whatsoever incorrect in my reply. I am right to point out that your correction does not invalidate his point at all and with the addition of my context actually makes his point stronger.  Hamas is wildly popular in the Palestinian territories. They absolutely support Hamas to a super majority. People that understand the conflict and are pro-Palestine unapologetically support Hamas as a liberation force. Or they pretend that they don't to appear moderate and influence people that *don't* understand the conflict. The commonly believed lie is that the Palestinians do not approve of Hamas and they're tyrannically occupying Gaza.  And yes. Unequivocally ""Free Palestine"" means the entire country of Israel. All of it. Not just Gaza and the West Bank. All of Israel.",cplusequals,2025-04-22T11:37:34,-3
"I did say the West Bank. Which is an order of magnitude larger than Gaza, incidentally. And you're still being reductive.  48% (not a majority by any measure) of Palestinians support armed struggle (surprise surprise), which incidentally includes not only Hamas but al-Aqsa, Hezbollah, and other terrorist organizations.   However, most Palestinians supported Oct 7th at the time.  All of which are regrettable facts representing shitty opinions, but none of which mean Hamas == Palestine.  Nuance matters.",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-22T11:51:52,4
"> Nuance matters...you're still being reductive.  The irony. You're not talking to the person you originally replied to, you know that right?  I'm the one giving more context and digging into the details here. >80% of Palestinians supported the October 7th attack. It is not reductive to point this out. Hamas is not an occupying force, they enjoy widespread support. To repeat myself, the only reason Hamas does not run the West Bank is because the PNA cancelled elections. Trying to deflect away from this and say Palestinians also support other terrorist organizations as well is a WILD attempt to salvage your position. The guy you replied to is wrong in only the detail that Hamas only officially runs Gaza. Your correction does not substantively contradict his point.  And for the third time, yes, ""Free Palestine"" and the popular ""From the river to the sea"" chants undeniably are calling for the complete destruction of Israel. The land Israel sits on is ""Palestine."" How come you're ignoring this? Because I'm correct.",cplusequals,2025-04-22T12:06:53,5
"The ""From the river to the sea ""chant is definitely evil, and I'm not debating the toxic motivation behind it. ""Free Palestine"" is debatable.  The land Israel sits on is also simply ""Israel"", or ""Canaan"", ""Palestine"", ""the Levant"", ""Phoenicia""... Not sure what your point is here.  No matter what, it's still wrong to oversimplify and reduce all of the *present-day Palestinian Authority-administered territory* plus Gaza to ""Hamas"", or some nebulous equivalent to Hamas, or to reduce all support for the *people who self-identify as Palestinian* plight as equivalent to support for Hamas.  There's simply no excuse for painting everyone with the same brush. Call the terrorists and their supporters out on their shit. Appreciate that there are also innocents caught up in the mess. Support Israel in its efforts to clean up the mess. Not hard.",Jaegermeiste,2025-04-22T12:21:51,5

You've completely forgotten the original post.  > it's still wrong to oversimplify  You're oversimplying it trying to make it seem like it's ""Hamas"" and ""everyone else in the Palestinian territories."" I'm giving you MORE NUANCE pointing out how that only applies to a very small minority. Most Palestinians -- the overwhelming majority of Palestinians -- are in the third group of non-Hamas terror supporters.  And in the west there's an extra group of naive and unknowledgeable individuals that believe that Hamas is an occupying force that the Palestinians don't like and are victimized by. These are the useful idiots that pretend most Palestinians are innocents that don't actually desire the destruction of the state of Israel and just want to live and let live. They exclusively exist in western nations and increasing their numbers has been an an explicit goal of the Hamas leadership in order to secure more funding for their terror campaign.  Now quit with the stupid gymnastics and linguistic games and come have an honest conversation. This feels like trying to get a leftist to admit DEI is explicitly racist.  Edit: You know what, nah.
