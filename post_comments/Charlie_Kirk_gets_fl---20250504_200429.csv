We need to stop giving him attention,sikhcoder,2025-05-04T20:38:15,348
She’s playing the Republican playbook talk over those you don’t agree with. Good for her. They hate it when their own BS is used agaist them,fuckitbuddy,2025-05-04T20:25:12,364
He doesn’t like it when people speak over him with facts. How the turn tables.,GonePhishingAgain,2025-05-04T20:15:09,175
"""I didnt interrupt you..."" cool, except that literally 14 seconds before saying what you didnt do....you did. You thumb.",Queasy-Trip1777,2025-05-04T22:06:50,71

Most college students can talk over Charlie Kirk. College was too hard for him so he dropped out. It makes him mad that people he thinks are below him can out achieve him so easily. Too many dumb people don't realize they are dumb. He is their poster boy.,Hamiltoncorgi,2025-05-04T21:37:37,79
I am following Dean Withers and a couple other Left leaning debaters that went to try to debate he refused because they weren’t college students. He is such a coward.,LatinaMermaid,2025-05-05T07:30:03,11
The best part is how she doesn’t allow him to speak,SeaworthinessThen542,2025-05-05T07:23:44,11
She’s makes sense. He never does. People like him always try to make sense out of illogical thinking. It’s about being right for them even when they know they are wrong. They see it as an opportunity to argue which is fun for them.,HotSprinkles10,2025-05-05T02:47:52,17
Was waiting for him to pull his infamous question since he's backed in a corner,IloveHitman4ever,2025-05-05T09:31:02,3
“I didn’t interrupt” as he definitely interrupted her. Gotta love when that dbag gets all pissy because someone is right.,Sparkyrock,2025-05-06T00:29:38,3
I thought I heard Charlie Kirk is a rapist,sten45,2025-05-05T14:02:20,2
"I hate the faux-decency of these right wing assholes. the idea of ‘I’m saying it nicely so it’s more legitimate’ while interrupting people, being racist, treating human beings like cattle and acting like philandering douches plays into the white privilege that gives them a career but would give my black ass a lawsuit for ‘disturbing the peace’. Charlie Kirk is a ideological coward and a joke. He’s not serious, so let’s stop treating him seriously.",nobletaco7,2025-05-05T18:17:21,2
Wow! She just calmly destroyed him with facts and logic! Well done!,Shferitz,2025-05-05T03:25:20,6
What shocked me was Gavin Newsom admitted that his kid got excited when he found out Charlie was his next guest.,darko702,2025-05-05T01:06:42,6
"She’s speaking truths  He tries spitting politicking   Huge difference, no leg to stand on charlie ",WetFinsFine,2025-05-05T02:30:14,3
"He didn't seem too ""floored"".",[deleted],2025-05-04T21:07:30,6
"I’m seeing this idiot getting owned more and more. Maybe it’s always been like that, I mean he is a fucking scumbag that just rehearsals sound bites to get people worked up, but seeing it more gives me hope he’ll just walk away from the public eye with his tail between his legs.",aamabkra,2025-05-05T12:41:26,1
She could give Gavin Newsom a lesson or two about how to handle Charlie Kirk!,throw65755,2025-05-05T12:58:29,1
I have no idea who Kirk is and hope to keep it that way. Next!,Different_Ad3513,2025-05-05T21:18:03,1
"Charles Kirk is a nobody, why would any right minded person give him the time of day? He won't bend he won't change. The less publicity you give him the less Relevant he is.",Magikpoo,2025-05-06T00:56:57,1

What is up with his head. He looks like that one villain from the dick Tracy movie who has the huge head but the tiny face. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-05T06:42:37,1

" Kirk doesn't believe diversity should be a deciding factor.The lady is stating the country is diverse, but doesn't give reason as to why diversity matters in hiring. For example, I don't believe we should have DEI hiring practices. However, I also believe the economic situation for inner city communities needs support. The problem DEI addresses is just a symptom. So no, Kirk wasn't floored. It was just 2 people talking at each other.",VacationImaginary233,2025-05-05T12:10:04,-1
This clip is nonsense. She just kept cutting him off and not letting him speak,KillerDad0987,2025-05-04T21:42:55,-42
"Attention makes his face grow. He’s trying to counteract the curse the ancient witch placed on him and finally grow into the rest of his head, we can’t allow that to happen.",FourWhiteBars,2025-05-04T23:47:12,67
Seriously talking to him mean he has work. Watching him means he has work.,Leading-Respond-8051,2025-05-05T01:34:10,12
Its not that hes growing with people's attention its that hes paid to be out there spreading the hate message,FamousRooster6724,2025-05-05T01:39:34,10
"Talk over him? He interrupted her then came out with ""let me finish"". What a douche.",Ferreteria,2025-05-04T20:51:15,126
Well it works especially well when coupled with facts,mjhripple,2025-05-05T00:19:49,27
"She even used their favorite technique which is a long pause then keep going. It’s specifically so they can say, “Let me finish.” She aced her statement by maintaining tone and avoiding hyperbole.",PaulClarkLoadletter,2025-05-05T07:40:18,25
Little Benny has entered the chat,sten45,2025-05-05T14:03:43,3
Yeah he does. All these right wing influencers and politicians have huge humiliation fetishes. Why else would they repeatedly go in public and spew nonsense that is easily proven false? Because they get off being made fun of.,Tiiimmmaayy,2025-05-05T08:52:47,16

Why would she let him interrupt her? He should wait until she’s finished making her point.,Laceykrishna,2025-05-04T22:00:03,26
