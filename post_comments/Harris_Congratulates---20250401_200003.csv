"Does anybody else feel a little grifted by her? I was all on the Harris train, even without a party primary. But she took in soooo much money and now ETA is the one trying to foot the bill for the fight. She has been basically crickets and handed stuff over with a problem. Knowing that there was a high chance the election was tampered with.",jokersvoid,2025-04-02T16:44:05,-3

"The point of the speech?   Getting caught fighting back. Getting across the board coverage for this.   Even if places like Fox and Newsmax made fun of Booker for this, they still aired some of his speech.   Maybe something like this breaks through to some of those who sat out the 2024 election, some who were Biden-Trump voters or Trump-Harris voters.  It got over 175 million reactions on TikTok so a shit-ton (the metric version) of people saw parts of this. It seems like it was a breakthrough moment.",Brysynner,2025-04-02T12:12:58,3
