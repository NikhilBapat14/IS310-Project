"I guess it depends on the will and political capital of Republicans at play.  93% of abortions are performed in the 1st trimester (13 weeks or before). Any legislated legality between 13 and 20 weeks would be a win for everyone and a fair compromise, IMHO.

The abortions that happen later in the pregnancy are the emergency abortions.   There should never be any legislation against abortion at any stage.   Abortion bans equal dead mothers.,[deleted],2024-11-19T16:05:03,44

"Prolife  is most against abortions where is mother life is not at risk and the baby will survive birth. Abortions  in first trimester usually but not always falls under there.  The later abortions are usually not always, more justified.  Mother’s heath, or something happened to the baby.

">The government doesn't have any business telling me what I can or can not do with my body. It is a right, not a privilege. That means all women would lose their rights. That would mean less freedom and democracy  First, its not a right, no matter how much you complain.  Second, we can and do limit actual rights, so even if it was, it doesn't mean it would be unlimited.  Third, almost every law has exceptions for the life of the mother, rape and incest.  That covers the edge cases as the [vast majority of abortions are elective](https://www.pcuc.org/resources/statistics-on-abortion/).  And given only [1% of abortions are done after 21 weeks](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/25/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-us/#when-during-pregnancy-do-most-abortions-occur), its extremely rare.  Last, the government can and does tell men what to do with their body, even so much as to tie college aid to it.  We can be drafted against our will and sent to fight in some god-awful war.

It would mean no states had legal abortion past 13 weeks. More states with abortion bans are bad. They are already making it difficult to get an abortion where they have the 6 weeks ban.,pit_of_despair666,2024-11-19T18:12:12,8

">A draft is not equivalent to abortion rights in several ways and hasn't been an issue since the 1970s.   You're right, its so much worse in terms of ""bodily autonomy"" in many, many ways.  And given late-term abortions are exceedingly rare, let's use your standard and say its not an issue.  >People who are agaisnt abortion believe it because of their Christian beliefs.  Not necessarily.  I know several atheists who are against abortion because of their own personal experiences.  And others who are against it because they don't like the idea of aborting a viable child except in the most extreme of circumstances.  >It is also a way to control women.  Only in the sense that you don't get to abort a child for any reason at any time.  But you still have dozens of methods of birth control... and abstinence of course.  Further, I have *no interest* in controlling you and this is a strawman argument as well.  >A lot of people can't just afford to move whenever they want to or travel across state lines and get an abortion.  ""[T]ravel across state lines"" like its some big cost.  People get to make choices.  If they fail at that decision making and get pregnant, then they might have to make sacrifices.  That's life.  >I dare you to post that in a medical sub with doctors. I just read a post from a doctor about how he had to watch a girl slowly die from sepsis because they wouldn't abort the baby that died inside of her.  That doctor needs to be charged with malpractice.  >Another thing is that these abortion laws are causing a doctor shortage.  Now that might be the most BS excuse I've heard so far.  Congrats!  >Even for people who don’t develop sudden life-threatening complications, doctors note that carrying a pregnancy to term is inherently risky because rapid physical and hormonal changes can exacerbate chronic health conditions and trigger new complications.  So... maybe you should take precautions to avoid getting pregnant if you don't want to go through this completely natural process.  >If more people are forced to continue unwanted pregnancies, there are bound to be more pregnancy-related deaths: A study by the University of Colorado estimates a 24% increase in maternal deaths if the United States bans abortion federally.  [Here's the study](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7g29k) you cite and its a BS study.  It uses data from 2020 (pre-Dobbs) and increases maternal deaths by 210 *in total*.  Yes, that's right, total maternal deaths in the US for 2020 was 861.  *In total*.  Its exceedingly rare given there were over [3.6 *million* births in 2020](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr012-508.pdf).  Let's put this in comparison - [almost the same number of people died in 2022 due to unintentional falls](https://www.nsc.org/work-safety/safety-topics/slips-trips-falls).  And a bigger one: [58,220 men](https://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics) died in Vietnam.  It would take half a millenia, at the ""higher estimated rate"" to have as many deaths from maternal complications.  Actually, its more than that because we really should only be using the 210 due to the US ""controlling women's bodies"".  And that's just paying off the last draft, if another happened the new deaths would overwhelm that 210 per year...  >I am not talking to someone who doesn't care if women die or not.  I care.  But I actually look at the facts and read beyond headlines.  ETA: Ah, the old ""reply and then block"".  You're a coward and a control freak.  Here's the reply to your comment that I at least got to read.  >You don't care about women's deaths. You keep downplaying them. Any preventable deaths are too many.  No, I'm putting them into context and, in doing so, showing that your argument is at the *very* edge of the case.  >You also don't care about us being forced to do something without our consent but you care when men are forced to go to war.  What are you being forced to do?  Show personal responsibility?  > Something that is not a current issue.  That is something *we don't know*.  Given we've just given Ukraine permission to hit deeper into Russia and Russia has said it might use nukes against Ukraine, it could spin out of control very fast.  >Birth control is not always reliable and some women can't take birth control.  What percentage of women cannot use birth control?  I'd love to see that stat.  And there are other forms of birth control other than just the pill.  Except in cases of rape, abstinence is 100% effective.  And that's free!  >Some women only have places like planned parenthood to go to. They take their funding away and they close.  Why should the government fund a private entity?  Can it not find the funding on its own?  Are there no one out there willing to donate?  >You didn't include statistics in there of how many die without adequate healthcare and birth control.  Well, given we're talking about birth control and the lack of abortion leading to deaths... that's called ""maternal death"".  And I did cite it.  About as many women die to it as unintended falls.  Want me to cite them again?  So now to your study:  >**Objectives.** To examine associations between state-level variation in abortion-restricting policies in 2015 and total maternal mortality (TMM), maternal mortality (MM), and late maternal mortality (LMM) from 2015 to 2018 in the United States.  >**Conclusions.** Restricting access to abortion care at the state level may increase the risk for TMM.  Funny how you didn't cite that.  > I first learned about abortion when I was forced to watch an anti-abortion video at the church I was forced to go to when I was younger  God forbid that the church teach its doctrines to those who attend it!  >Roe VS Wade would not have been reversed if it was not for the ultra-conservative cristofacist Leo Leonard who is in Opus Dei an organization in the Catholic Church.  Now you're just being a bigot.  Because we all know that ultra-conservative cristofacist [RGB](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240315-in-history-ruth-bader-ginsburg-foresaw-threat-to-us-abortion-access) thought *Roe* was bad law.  >Some religious groups have little or no ambivalence about abortion. ""For instance, the nation’s largest denomination – the Roman Catholic Church – opposes abortion in all circumstances. The second-largest church, the Southern Baptist Convention, also opposes abortion, although it does allow an exception in cases where the mother’s life is in danger.  You're surprised that a religion based on the value of life is anti-abortion?  You realize that the Catholic church has a *huge* post-partum network of support to support their anti-abortion view.  >Other sizable religious groups in opposition to abortion with few or no exceptions include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) and the Assemblies of God, the largest U.S. Pentecostal denomination. Hindu teaching also is generally opposed to abortion.""   Oh its those Hindu-fascists at work again!  >This is all about how Religious groups have influenced abortion care and rights in the US.  So you're telling me that in a democractic republic, where people are also allowed freedom of religion, might want to influence the laws of the land, using their freedom of speech, to reflect the fact that they think that life should be protected.  Which is in line with the [science as well](https://lozierinstitute.org/a-scientific-view-of-when-life-begins/).  Even these christo-fascists disagree as to what level to protect it.  Edit #2: Hey /u/vinnie_puh, you jerk, nice way to reply and then block me so I can't reply.  Go back to Bluesky.

">Reconsider opining on a topic where your life and the lives of people like you will never be at stake. This isn't a hypothetical for women.  Not the person you were trying to belittle, but sorry buddy, this does impact me and my wife.  And, given this is a free country, I can talk about the issue and my view on it.  But if you want to install this rule in discussions, then we need to get rid of the income tax because no one should have any say on *my* income.  >Would your opinions on abortion be different if, for the sake of equality, we killed the partner of any woman who died from pregnancy complications? Would it still matter that only 861 women died in 2021?  So we're here arguing the edges for less than 2k deaths a year in your totalitarian fantasy.  That's roughly [half the number of men who die in the workplace](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187127/number-of-occupational-injury-deaths-in-the-us-by-gender-since-2003/) every year.  Maybe we can solve that by killing their bosses when they die?  Would that make you care more about men?  See, I can be as belittling as you can!  This whole argument is basically pointless.  The number of abortions for rape or incest are basically [a rounding error](https://abort73.com/abortion_facts/us_abortion_statistics/) - in 2004 abortions for rape was half a percent.  In 2021, just in Florida (same source), was 0.15% and incest was 0.01.  The *vast, vast* majority of abortions were entirely election (74.2%), aborted for ""social or economic reasons (21.3%) and because of a ""threat to the psychological health"" of the mother (1.89%).  Even if we go back to the 2004 data, the top reasons were: ""Not ready for child"" (24%), ""can't afford a baby"" (23%), ""Done having children"" (19%), don't want to be a single mother (8%), and ""not mature enough to raise a child"" (7%).  Its sad because *every one of those reasons* are completely avoidable by either using other forms of birth control... or abstaining from sex.  I mean, all these people went through public schools!  They should know... oh wait, that's another entirely different issue.  And on top of that, the vast majority of abortions occur before 13 weeks (same source) - 93%.  France, for example, [disallows abortion after 14/16 weeks and after with some doctor sign off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_France).  In summation, what I'm saying is if we adopted France's abortion laws, added cases of rape and incest, we'd cover something like 95% of reasons why people actually abort their children.  Let's set that, understand the statistics, and then we can start to argue how many angels dance on the head of the abortion doctor while he's killing a child.
