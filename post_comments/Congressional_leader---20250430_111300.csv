"I was on a flight with Lindsey Graham once and no one knew who he was. These polls feel good but if the bad ones keep getting elected, then nothing will change.",Askia-the-Creator,2025-04-30T11:36:30,11
Good. What the fuck have they done to gain anyone’s approval? I see very few elected officials doing who are actually doing their job. Half of congress is too busy playing team sports and the other half is floundering trying to find a direction and footing in a fight they’ve basically already lost. They should all have absolute dogshit approval ratings until they stand up and govern like they were elected to do,RegurgitatedMincer,2025-04-30T12:11:58,5
"Pretty uninteresting, many Americans pay basically no attention to this and have no idea who Congressional leadership is, they just don't like ""Congress"" as a nebulous government entity to pin blame on and so this polling reflects that.",nosayso,2025-04-30T11:26:06,6
"If you voted for them, and Trump 2.0., this is what you voted for.   So, if you're drowning, don't expect any lifguards to help you, as they were cut from the budget.",DarthHiccups,2025-04-30T11:18:19,4

"The leadership in this country do not represent American citizens, all of them of are just shills for who ever is paying them, and it shows in their approval ratings.",Routine-Reaction-592,2025-04-30T11:26:46,30
"Amazing, that is amazingly horrid.",pethanct01,2025-04-30T14:31:19,6
To be fair the vast majority of Americans pay zero attention when Congress does something good. All most people want is more outrage.,Grouchy_Tackle_4502,2025-04-30T13:29:44,4
Well one of the first things to learn about them is they're supposed to be a check on the other branches and pass laws to help people. Have they done that?,seriousofficialname,2025-04-30T11:38:57,10
"The poll literally points out that a substantial number of people have no idea who these guys are, including as much as 50% of their own party's voters.  But that's how it's always been. It's why McConnell could have a 33% approval rate and still win his seat in landslides. The only approval rating that matters to these guys is where they're seated, and they usually poll very differently in their own districts/states while their national approval is essentially a meaningless number.",Lord0fHats,2025-04-30T11:28:27,6
"I would add that many don't know the difference between a republican or democrat. They vote for ""individuals,"" which is pure stupidity.",Brownstown75,2025-04-30T12:02:03,2
