Dems should be calling this out on congressional hearings and in all of the media channels.  Soft messaging is no linger appropriate.  He needs to be called out as a criminal multiple times each day.  Impeachment articles have to be filed.  Lawsuits should be filed for this blatant criminality.,tjk45268,2025-05-01T15:03:40,10

"If it's on a blockchain, it can be traced. Crypto is already (supposedly) regulated. I think the regulation is the issue. And not crypto regulation per se, but regulation against embezzlement, conflict of interest, and every other law Trump has broken so far.",Jhopsch,2025-05-01T21:26:10,2
