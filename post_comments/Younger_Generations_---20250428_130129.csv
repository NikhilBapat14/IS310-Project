" People tent to scapegoat ""the government "" when in actuality they should be properly blaming party politics for so much of their stress surrounding ""the government"".  The parties rely on maintaining ""wedge issues"" keeping them front and center and unsolvable to feed the parties flag waving bases. The parties weren't written into this governments design but they sure have taken it over and ruined it.. People should reject the parties and the party politics they cultivate.   Party politics make governing a team sport, which it should not be.  To be a good party member you must wear blinders always avoiding any minor flaws within the platform as well as other seriously flawed canadates bringing success to the party. Blinders always on for the team! General stupidity.  Party politics is stupid and the failed two-party system in the U.S. is who you can thank for paving the road towards Trumps ascendancy. People had at this point and for a long time, been sick and tired of the parties and Trump was their answer. An outsider....anything but the normal.  The Republican party didn't contain Trump and diminish him as the Democrat party leaderships had with Bernie. The republican leadership was out of touch just enough to not see the Trump threat as realistic. Well, now they know. And that Republican party is now dead and gone.   The Democrat party has always been more successful with tamping down any real ""change"" candidates and this is their gift prize for being so good at controlling the party: total and complete failure. People have zero faith in Democrats and thats because the people are actually smart most of the time. Democrats bring weak loosing arguments, they're predictable and will continue to play by all the the rules that will help them loose against known cheaters. They would rather be ""right"" on issues than win.   Let me guess Democratic leadership: whomever you'll choose to champion next will be be someone who checks all the boxes that will uniquely motivate all the usually non-voting hillbillies out to voting booths to vote against them....because it's the overly simplisticly symbolic ""right thing"" to do. That'll show em.   As we're currently learning from the front row: winning needs to be made the paramount concern, not being virtuous.   The party's are to blame for almost all of this. And they're not part of the design. People should reject parties. Support candidates who don't start by pledging to their party first but who run on issues that will benefit the people not the party",AgitatedEdge213,2025-04-29T06:45:55,1

"Being a Dem is no longer cool.  I am serious here.  Growing up in the 90's the left were definitely the ""counter-culture"" party.  It was the party you joined to rebel against your parents or against ""the man"" or whatever.  Since then, culture has shifted enough left that it is seen by the younger generation as the status quo.  So to rebel and be cool, they are turning towards racism and anything ""anti-woke.""    Great example is the depiction of LGBT+ people in media.  In the 90's it was a pretty big deal to show a normal gay person in a show (take all the media around Ellen D coming out on her show).  But by 2010 or so, having a gay couple, like in Modern Family, is just seen as normal.  So to rebel against the new normal, is to become a bigot",Al_Tilly_the_Bum,2025-04-28T14:06:20,-3
"There are a lot of highly visible leftist ideas that are not popular enough, such as ""Defunding the Police"" and ""Trans Rights"".  The ""Defund the Police"" stuff from a few years back was clearly a bad, bad slogan/idea - I think basically everyone agrees on that now considering its results. ""Trans Rights"", while a good idea and something we should fight for, just isn't popular enough, which leads to pushing people away from voting for other Democratic policies such as ""Pushing Back Against Authoritarianism"" and ""Being a Decent Human"" even if those other policies by themselves are pretty popular.  Those ideas that don't have a critical mass of popular support should either be worked on to get them that critical mass or the party shouldn't make them a highly visible pillar of our policies; if necessary, we should cut them from the platform. We also should accept people into the party who don't abide by some of those ideas that don't yet have the critical mass, even ones that are really important like trans rights, in order to not sacrifice all of our other priorities.  Note that this is just trying to answer the question of ""Why would anyone think the Democrats are extreme?""; there are plenty of other valid criticisms of the Democratic Party, like ""Being Too Corporatist"", ""Leadership Being Too Old and Centralized"", and ""Not Being Willing To Meaningfully Stand Up For Our Rights"".",LangyMD,2025-04-28T13:54:53,-12

"Yes.  Despite the fact that Democrats had the majority in the House, and Senate, and the presidency, Biden's entire agenda was blocked by Republicans because Manchin and Sinema sided with Republicans to tank his signature bill, Build Back Better.  Democrats were prevented from raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by the Senate Parliamentarian.  Republicans, from the minority, leveraged the debt ceiling to get concessions on the safety net out of Democrats such as increasing the top end of the age limit for SNAP work requirements for ABAWDs in the 2023 omnibus bill.  Republicans AGs sued to block Biden's broad student debt relief and the SAVE plan.  Republicans overrode Biden's COVID emergencies (and their related flexibilities).  Now, there are fair arguments to be made about the reasons for all of these. Manchin was a very conservative democrat. Democrats didn't want the government to shut down when republicans were holding the debt ceiling hostage. Etc.  The problem isn't just that Democrats don't get stuff done, but they don't use their minority to oppose republicans effectively. Problem is, they respect the traditions of the institution while Republicans don't.  Republicans are trampling on the constitution, blatantly violating the law and it's crickets.

Third party voters would have done it too. Stop pretending that not voting for the candidate who could actually stop Trump was harmless.
