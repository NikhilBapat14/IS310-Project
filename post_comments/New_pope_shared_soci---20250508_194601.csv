"I'm a cradle Catholic. He's spent a lot of time in Peru, he is sympathetic to the plight of poverty in South America. As we all should be. It's not surprising he's critical of Trump's immigration policy. After all, we were once strangers in Egypt.  It doesn't mean we can support them, or that those who came here illegally don't have to go back. They need to help fix their own home.   But we should still have common human decency towards all of God's children. I'm glad the Pope feels the same.

"That’s was not the previous Pope’s position. I don’t know a lot about Catholics but from what I understand they have a duty to follow his lead whether you agree with it or not.   Therefore even if you say that we can still be enforcing our laws, that’s not what the Pope is suggesting we do.   Are you allowed to have a conflicting belief with the Pope, especially when its clear that the Pope is being hypocritical with his position when Vatican is enforcing their immigration laws vehemently but expecting Americans to just roll over and let everyone in?  Perhaps my limited understanding of the impacts of the Pope’s  position and attitude towards certain topics are erroneous.  ",Blahblahnownow,2025-05-09T10:05:35,-52

">When it comes to the catholic church, the pope's words are the words of the lord himself.   No. No no no. Totally, unequivocally wrong. Where did you hear this?   The pope is not God. He is not a prophet, he is not an angel. He does not speak FOR God. It’s why we still pray to God not the pope. He preaches the word of the lord as all clergymen do, but sharing the word of the Lord is not the equivalent of speaking divine words from the Lord. In fact we are taught the clergy is guided by the Holy Spirit on how to interpret and share God’s teachings! The pope is the ultimate human source of knowledge of scripture and teachings. But he is still human. He is not free from sin.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-08T23:30:09,24

"""Allowed"" to? That's a pretty heavy theological debate. Strictly speaking, no. However - The Pope is a man, and he only speaks with the backing of divine infallibility when speaking ex cathedra.   Think of it like this - You're a CEO. You can have opinions on things, have discussions about things, tweet about stuff, but the actual policy of the company is only changed when you have a board meeting and write down and disseminate said new policy. And you've only had two board meeting in the 2000 year history of your company.

"The Pope is authoritative on the teachings of the church, but how to effectively achieve that via voting is well outside their expertise or authority as the head of the church.

"I would leave the formal institution of the Catholic Church if a series of men appointed by other men change the main principles of the church, yes. I would still worship and chat with Jesus privately, but I would no longer sponsor my parish or Catholic orgs, receive sacraments, or spread the good word. To be clear I would leave the church not the belief in the religion. Catholicism has some basic tenants. If those are changed it’s no longer the church in which I was raised. I do not believe in “adapting” the church to modern times like these new wave christian hippy churches do and like lazy methodists and episcopalians do, and like some fellow Catholics do.

"Here is an example  > Second, they are infallible because it's the Holy Spirit that's speaking through them. The Holy Spirit cannot be wrong, and so the pope cannot be either in those moments of divine inspiration. It's the same principle as why the Bible contains no errors or falsehoods - the authors were all inspired by the Holy Spirit and so it doesn't just contain testimonies about Word of God - it is the Word of God in a very literal sense.   Now you may say that they were just talking about “moments of divine inspiration”. But then the question is when are those moments?

Your example literally doesn't matter.

"No, I’m just not a Catholic. So to me, this is all new information. My church didn’t have any such hierarchy. The hierarchy was us and then God. That’s it. No middlemen to have to speak to or follow if you didn’t want to. So if the Pope is infallible how do you explain when they have different opinions on the same matter?

"You're talking about the death penalty, or do you have something else in mind? It's well documented that the death penalty stance changed because we now live in an era where food and shelter aren't constantly at threat of being lost: lifetime imprisonment used to be impossible, for almost all of human history.  If you mean the 1983 Canon Law change from ""no servile work on Sundays"", that's another logical update. Most people for most of history absolutely needed servile labor daily- see Jesus pointing to saving people and livestock from holes on the Sabbath. However, now that we have, you know, jobs like computer programming and such that are quite widespread, language with more clarity is necessary. Focusing on God and prayer primarily on Sunday, while finding different activity so as to recreate, yet still planning around Sunday so as to facilitate those goals, that's more sensible. The sin against the Lord's Day didn't change, a group of theologians agreed it needed clarification in light of common, and unprecedented, social change.  So we see two examples of how sin didn't change, but the world has, so our collective understanding of how not to turn away from God (which is sin) must be clarified and agreed upon as we react to living in the world. Forgive me if my fervor to answer your objection came off as sarcastic, that's absolutely not my intention. In fact, if you have a specific ""sin that was changed"" in mind, or a Church teaching that you've been told contradicts Scripture, I'm quite pleased to help, here or in Chat. But, you can see, its quite an extreme suggestion to propose that a pope can change what is and isn't sin. We have thousands of years of revelation, mystics, theologians, exorcisms, and miracle workers to look to to understand what is offensive and pleasing to God.",Professor_Seven,2025-05-10T07:14:58,1
