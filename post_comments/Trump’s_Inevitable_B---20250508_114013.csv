I know maga voters think the rest of the country looks down on them. I just don't understand how they can't see that a new York billionaire coastal elite doesn't absolutely fucking hate them. Like his disdain and disgust for them is so clear it's amazing that they worship him like a literal god.,The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-08T11:41:27,56
There's nothing he could do that could betray them. He could bang their wives and they would thank him for it. He could build the Trump interstate over their houses and they would pray to him for releasing them from their material possessions.,Colonel-Mooseknuckle,2025-05-08T11:45:25,15
Here's the truth he has followers and supporters. Followers are poor or working class maga. He'd throw them in front of a car for a nickel. To him they are slaves that for some reason can vote. His supporters are rich people who will kiss his ass he listens to.,Faucet860,2025-05-08T11:45:55,10
Trump doesn’t actually respect most of his supporters. They are just gullible bums who waste money on stupid things.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-08T11:54:05,7
"Trump leads a fascist white supremacist movement. What all these writers and pundits refuse to get is ANY policy will be accepted as long as it can be framed as furthering that cause.   It's dead simple and perfectly easy to understand. Too many intelligent writers, pundits and people are unwittingly making it seem more legitimate my parsing policy details and trying to interpret what Trump means when he talks.",Jubal81,2025-05-08T12:08:31,5

"Yeah I’ve been hearing this since before the election. Whether they’re disappointed or not, they’d still vote for him and probably will vote for him again when he manages to run for an unconstitutional third term",RedBeardedBud,2025-05-08T12:08:11,3

"It’s because he appeals to their basest emotions. His speeches, while lacking in substance, are 100% emotion. He frames their problems with stark black/white storybook simplicity so their brain cells aren’t taxed too much. He stresses over and over again, in the simplest of terms, that he’s going to magically solve all their problems without giving the details of any solution. Frankly, I don’t think they want to hear about the intricacies of statecraft. They worship him because they desperately want to believe that all their struggles can be solved by the star of The Apprentice, despite all contradictory evidence on the ground. They’ve already committed their faith to him this far; they have sunk too much in emotional cost for them to question him at this point.",Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-08T12:00:55,17

This is not true. ONLY the individuals he did that to specifically would regret their vote because he did it to them and not somebody else.,couldburdad,2025-05-08T12:20:35,3
Men brought Mussolini their wives to bang in order to try and curry favor.  So this isn't even hyperbole.  It literally happened.,Poet_of_Justice,2025-05-08T14:54:18,1
"Thank you for articulating this point. The followers tend to fall into a specific category: hopeless, poor, (mostly) white people that have felt forgotten. They are the ones that think the country, and democrats, are giving away everything to everyone BUT them. While the democrats can be blamed for more city/suburban focus, their overall policies are solid. They just can’t get the messaging right it appears. Mostly because the followers want someone to save them. They want to blame others for their lot in life and take no responsibility for it, and expect the government to fix it all for them that have been neglected and forgotten, and given their fair due. But they also expect to not pay more taxes, have smaller government, and still get all the things they currently rely on. But when they see rich people being pushed into their face 24/7 on every platform, they expect that to happen to them through their savour, Donald Trump.   Supporters follow along as long as their goals are the same. When they don’t, supporters peace out.",invincibleparm,2025-05-08T16:39:45,3
"True to a degree but there's a squishy middle/moderate that likes they're racism and bigotry more quiet, that doesn't want to burn it all down so long as the libs burn first, and that probably voted for Biden in 2020.  Trump has no power without them and he's losing them.",atreeismissing,2025-05-09T00:09:52,0
