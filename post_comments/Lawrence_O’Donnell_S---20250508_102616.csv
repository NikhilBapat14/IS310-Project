"> MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell claims an answer that President Trump gave in an interview could be a sign of “mental illness.” O’Donnell speculated about what could be gleaned about Trump’s mind when, asked on Meet the Press if he thinks he needs to uphold the Constitution as president, he answered: “I don’t know.” “Donald Trump’s answer was: ‘I don’t know,’ which could be a sign of mental illness, or it could be a sign of early-stage dementia in a 78-year-old man,” O’Donnell claimed on The Last Word Wednesday night. “Or it could simply be the product of a condition that Donald Trump has been exhibiting throughout his public life since long before he got into politics, and that is, of course, Donald Trump’s trademark public stupidity,” O’Donnell said.   I'd say it's both.",Aggravating_Money992,2025-05-08T10:28:03,1
"The disturbing part about that incident is that after he said ""I don't know"" the interviewer didn't show him a clip him taking the oath of office in which he did, indeed swear to uphold and defend the constitution.  Or was that a ""pinky swear""",Catspaw129,2025-05-08T10:46:33,1

He doesn't want to uphold the constitution so he can't say yes. But he's savvy enough to know he can't outright say no. So he falls back to his standard MO: feigning ignorance.   How many times did he claim not to know someone who became a problem.,RedLanternScythe,2025-05-08T12:05:38,1

"It’s just my opinion but I think he’s saying that to look for the loophole. He can say yes, absolutely, or no, can disregard, he doesn’t want to say no exactly even if that’s what he’s doing. Or maybe, but maybe means no he doesn’t think he has to all the time.   He hasn’t read it amd he doesn’t understand it, but his perception of it is any way there’s a loophole he doesn’t have to adhere to what was previously understood and do something else and rationalize it as an interpretation somehow. He knows he has to uphold the constitution, and he also wants to do many things against it, so he’s trying to reconcile these under any technicality he can scrounge up so he can claim he kept his oath.",onomastics88,2025-05-08T11:15:06,1

That is what really irks me. My mom said she couldn’t forgive the Biden administration for obviously covering for him when he was in decline. That in his age he clearly had other people pulling the strings. Since Harris was part of that “cover up” that left her no choice but to vote for Trump…  What?! Fine don’t vote Harris write in Daffy Duck for all I care. But to act like Trump is in good mental health and doesn’t have other people puppeteering things is a delusion.,Gonnagremlin,2025-05-08T11:14:58,1
