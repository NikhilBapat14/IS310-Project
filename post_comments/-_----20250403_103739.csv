Anyone who buys even a single share of that stock is just about the dumbest person that ever lived. You have to be completely brain dead to invest your money in that company at this point.¬†  The only reason to buy even a single share of his stock is as legal bribery. Keep track of who buys it and demand democrats investigate if they win in 2026. ¬†There is simply no reason to buy that stock if trump is selling his. That company is worthless and will declare bankruptcy after he sells.¬†  This sale will be open bribery.¬†,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-04-04T00:19:10,3

Why is it worth billions even with him holding the stock?  I would assume a few million at the most.  It is an imitation Twitter that only Trump and his hardcore followers use.

"[It's a long story](https://youtu.be/L_ZBrAwDp44?si=I4TIYbLIFuAvgqJ_), but basically: It's only worth that much because people will pay \[Insert current stock price here\] for a share of Bribery Inc. so long as there's only so much on the market. The vitals on the company are essentially made up from a shell company; that's how it was able to go public so quickly and avoid submitting actual paperwork.  He owns SO MUCH of the current stock that if he sells it, the value will crash just from flooding the market with unwanted product.   It WAS thought he was going to need that money to keep his ass out of jail from all the money he owes for... y'know, TAX FRAUD, but apparently this country decided to learn that lesson the hard way.",lastres0rt,2025-04-03T18:59:32,8

"Like a bribe without calling it a bribe?  Instead of handing him money for a favor, they buy millions of stock and/or crypto?  Which then makes it seem more valuable than it actually is, which then tricks small-time investors into throwing money at it?  Except the retail investors actually think they're making a valid investment?  The whales know they won't get the money back because they are doing it as a bribe?  Is that correct?  Pardon my ignorance.  I'm just trying to get my head around this mess.  Edit:  Great video.  I (kinda) understand now. It's not really worth anything.  Trump does not create anything of value or provide any useful service.  He moves other people's money around and skims.  That is his specialty.",ZacoyaRyder,2025-04-03T19:01:47,4
