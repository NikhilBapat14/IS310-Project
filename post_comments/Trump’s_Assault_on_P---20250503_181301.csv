Yes! NPR and public news outlets can be state run to spread the word of Trump like Fox News and Russia. Big win for the GOP,Alwaystired254,2025-05-03T19:21:03,2

I am back to becoming a sustainer donor. I think viewers and listeners will step up to make up the govt’s 10%.   Tip to His Imperial Majesty: He should ban photos of himself from the rear. He looks like a lumbering hunchback codger that’s about 90 years old.,ScotchToo,2025-05-04T02:53:55,2

Equal public funding helps ensure there is actual news coverage especially with the money given with no requirement on special or dictated coverage. Private money can weld the direction more easily. Because you can see all that is given by who you can ensure the information is open and it is actual journalism instead of entertainment.,ghec2000,2025-05-04T08:59:30,1
Please do support your local station. That’s the best way to help right now.,Sea-Pomegranate4369,2025-05-03T19:11:10,15
"It’s not. This is a public-private partnership. The investment the government makes is minimal, but provides funding across all stations which helps make the cost of broadcast technology, programming rights, and music rights attainable whether your station has the individual funding to buy it or not. That’s why this potential cut is disproportionate and will cause rural stations to go off the air. Many of them receive 40% or more of their annual operation revenue from the government. stations in larger cities need less. All can then focus on diverse streams of revenue from individuals and sponsors. When you take away the government portion (which is $1.60 per person in our country per year - less than a cup of coffee in taxes), that has the potential to collapse the system.   These stations also serve as local outlets for the country’s emergency warning systems. They educate children in areas where pre-k is limited or doesn’t exist. And it’s FREE to all Americans to use, for a low investment.",Sea-Pomegranate4369,2025-05-03T19:10:06,10
It’s not free if it’s being paid by taxes. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-03T19:48:50,-7
"You’re right. It’s not free because it is subsidized by taxes, which means there is no fee to users at the point of access. It is publicly funded by tax dollars, at a very, very minimal cost. Your public library works the same way. There is no fee to you to have a library card. You could choose to buy the book, just like you could choose to pay for a Netflix subscription. However, this creates inequities to access for people who do not have the money to pay for these services. That’s why having a public media option that is not controlled by corporate interests, is important in a democracy.",Sea-Pomegranate4369,2025-05-03T19:57:23,11
So all the millions that our tax dollars have paid for this shit stain to golf is money better spent? Is that what you're trying to say? I hope you are not that delusional.,pooflinger85,2025-05-03T21:39:46,6
Ill gladly pay 1000% more to keep PBS free considering how much I watch the channel. They're particularly important in rural areas where poor resides. They're meant to be impartial unlike FAUX news and I'll.,DelightfulDolphin,2025-05-03T23:10:18,3
