"*‚ÄúCongress, not California, is the only body that can regulate the interstate automotive market,‚Äù Joyce said during a Monday meeting of the House Rules Committee, which considered the resolution before sending it to the House floor. ‚ÄúWhat works in Hollywood doesn‚Äôt work in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.‚Äù*  What a fucking dolt. California setting rules for California is NOT interstate. They aren't dictating anything to the automotive market. Republicans have zero consistency when it comes to government power. Small government, big government, no government - whatever accomplishes their goal for the minute. Right now it's fascist extremism by toddlers.",barneyrubbble,2025-05-02T08:15:29,23

"I disagree. CA has way stricter smog laws than fhe feds and because of that every single car is more expensive and parts themselves because of prob 65 or whatever is more expensive. If your catalytic converter is stolen in CA, you might as well sell your old truck, because getting cats in installed will cost probably $2500 on a $4000 truck.",dlw26,2025-05-02T08:35:33,-8
"We don‚Äôt have 100 years‚Äô worth of lithium. Global reserves are estimated at around 30 million metric tons, while demand is projected to quadruple by 2030 due to EV adoption.  Building extensive EV infrastructure now could mean overhauling it in 50 years as we transition to better technologies. Alternatives like hydrogen and natural gas are less environmentally damaging than gasoline and diesel. Currently, lithium mining‚Äôs environmental impact takes about 3‚Äì4 years to offset through EV use.",MarsupialNo375,2025-05-02T09:34:40,-4

Prop 65 is the one that says things that may cause cancer or reproductive harm (spoiler alert it's a lot of things) need to have a warning on them.   Also if they are charging your 2500 for a vat install find a new mechanic should be around a grand. And even on a 4k truck that's cheaper than a 70k truck.,19chevycowboy74,2025-05-02T09:04:23,5
"Its 'Prop 65' which I'm sharing specifically because when you say 'prob 65' it weakens your argument.     CA has strict smog laws because of how many cars there are here, and even more specifically because of the unique geography of the LA basin.  Have you seen pictures of CA before Regan signed CARB into law?  No one wants to live like that anymore.",TheFlyingBoxcar,2025-05-02T14:38:47,2
Hydrogen doesn't grow on trees. We would need more electric energy than we are producing right now just to replace the existing cars on the roads with hydrogen cars.¬†,Holiday-Force268,2025-05-02T09:57:09,4
"What are you talking about? Federal cats are less than $400 for an 03 avalanche all over the internet. CARB legal is twice that for cheap knock offs and over three times that for a quality one. That‚Äôs not because of population, that‚Äôs because of government regulations.   Here‚Äôs the other kicker, a CARB legal part for your car might not be legal on a different car that‚Äôs identical but has a different ‚Äúengine family‚Äù. Why the hell do identical cars have different engine family numbers with the same engine? I just experienced this with getting this done on the avalanche. The whole car enthusiast scene is horrible because of regulations so don‚Äôt get me started on that.",dlw26,2025-05-02T09:09:15,-2
You can‚Äôt ship Prob 65 products to CA at times.   Find a new mechanic? It doesn‚Äôt matter when the part is $1500. We shouldn‚Äôt have to pay half of what the vehicle costs for some parts dude. What part of that don‚Äôt you understand? We are the only ones paying an arm and a leg. It‚Äôs not fair for us.,dlw26,2025-05-02T09:14:07,-2
"It doesn‚Äôt weaken anything. Sellers don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle sometimes and prefer not to ship at all. All of these regulations takes a toll.  I‚Äôve seen picture, but guess what they didn‚Äôt have back then? Efficient engines and efficient smog equipment. Cars these days have EVAP, EGR, PCV, catalytic converters, and every other smog part. They are wayyy more efficient than ever. This argument always gets brought up and people don‚Äôt think of the strides made in technology since the 70s. Modern Cars these days have twice the HP and nearly twice the fuel economy.",dlw26,2025-05-02T14:54:35,1
"Same thing with EVs, also, most power grids are still running on carbon (coal, gas, etc.) there‚Äôs no great solution, but all my homies hate EVs",MarsupialNo375,2025-05-02T11:18:57,-1

"EVs are massively more efficient than using electricity to make hydrogen to then power cars.¬† As for ""dirty electricity"": yes, that exists. But that's not an argument to keep burning oil. It's an argument for more renewable energy sources.",Holiday-Force268,2025-05-02T19:40:18,2
You think the federal cars don‚Äôt have it? I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt have any regs at all. My point is that we can reduce it down to the federal standard. Either reduce it down to the federal standard or make CARB the federal standard. One state Shouldn‚Äôt have the power to enforce its own rules when no other state can.,dlw26,2025-05-02T17:59:52,1
"Im aware, as are you, that yes vehicles in america have emissions-reducing equipment.  Im also not under the impression that youre arguing against vehicles having said equipment.     Every State has the power to implement their own emissions laws, as CA has.  No State (including CA) has the ability to enforce their own emissions laws in other States.  And they dont.      The reason most vehicles in america meet the stricter-than-federal emissions standards is because vehicle manufacturers *choose* to do it that way.  They choose this so they dont have to manufacture some vehicles to one standard and some to a different standard.      In this way, CARB standards become the *de facto* standard nationwide, but thy're not the *legal* standard.  Which, reading your comment to the bottom, is one of the two options for which your advocating.      That's why cars have the emissions equipment they have.",TheFlyingBoxcar,2025-05-02T19:07:45,1
States have the choice to abide by the federal standards or the California standard. They can‚Äôt make up their own like CA can. It‚Äôs built right into the Clean Air act. The problem is when cars break and you have to fix them. Emissions equipment in CA is outrageously priced compared to their EPA counterparts.,dlw26,2025-05-02T21:07:37,1

"Arite man, I dont really know what your point is anymore.  Is it that cats are expensive?  Yeah, I know.  4 of my cars require them and I understand it sucks.  Is your point that States should be able to set their own emmisions laws?  Fine, I dont care.  Whats best for Oklahoma may not be what best for Florida, I dont care.  Is your point that there should be a standard across the country?  Kinda sounds like there is and you dont care for that.  I just dont care.
