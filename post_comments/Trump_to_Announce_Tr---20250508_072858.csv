Does the UK know about this deal?,AmrokMC,2025-05-08T07:32:05,8
"...but it's not an agreement, it's a framework. Hey, I wonder if they're gonna drop that 1% tariff on us down a bit... probably not.  90 deals in 90 days is looking good!!!",Fair_Escape5101,2025-05-08T07:31:00,4
The U.S. had a trade surplus with the U.K. of nearly $12 billion in 2024. It’s of the few major countries with which the U.S. doesn’t run a deficit,rapidcreek409,2025-05-08T07:30:52,2

"Trump will announce what HE wants, not what's been agreed, and then it'll be the UK's fault for not agreeing to it, not his. Man's a complete moron.",jamusbondusvii,2025-05-08T07:38:11,1
"Honest question, how long before he forgets he signed it, blames it on the Democrats, calls it the worst trade deal in history, and then openly violates it, like he did with the USMCA?",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-08T07:39:25,1
Trump took months to get one deal. The Art of the Deal is a lazy process. I assume those British dolls of Queen Elizabeth will keep the children satisfied.,ranchoparksteve,2025-05-08T07:42:44,1
The agreement is to begin trade deal negotiations.,30mil,2025-05-08T08:09:00,1
"Oh good, maybe they'll reduce the tariffs on Rolls-Royce cars.  Honest question, what are the real volumes of goods from the UK?",Iowa_Dave,2025-05-08T08:10:21,1
In a month he’ll rant about “Who would sign such a terrible trade deal!?!  Tariffs are back!  Biden is awful!”,shoppingfortruth,2025-05-08T09:05:12,1
Trump made deals with 200 countries and is only now getting to GB?  They should be offended they are so low on the priority list.,goibnu,2025-05-08T10:48:43,1
"Yeah we do   We’re likely going to be pretty happy with it - reduced tariffs for our steel and car exports, we don’t have to accept your stupidly low food quality standards, and in return we have to reduce tariffs on your cars which very few people will buy anyway because they’re too large for our roads and laughably uneconomical for our fuel costs. Also we’re probably knocking off a bit off our digital services tax that your massive companies like Amazon and meta pay but it isn’t going away completely according to rumour.   Trump is calling it a comprehensive deal but really it’s a few points knocked off some obvious areas of cooperation.   Shows he’s desperate for a win to announce because previously any deal with the U.S. has been held up by the US insisting on the UK accepting lower food standards as the price of entry, and Trump was still asking for that even a couple of months ago. Now apparently it’s not quite so important.",Drolb,2025-05-08T07:39:18,14
Came here to say that.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-08T07:33:54,3
It will be exactly what we have now and we will have conceded something to them just so Trump can say there is a deal.,TintedApostle,2025-05-08T07:46:20,3
"In a day or two, Trump won't even know about it. He's living in a fog of dementia.",Reviews-From-Me,2025-05-08T07:40:39,2

So now we're going to have a deficit. Great.,thistimelineisweird,2025-05-08T07:34:04,3
"I hope that's a card Starmer has tried to play, as the country subsidizing (using Trump's terminology) the US to the tune of $12 billion, we can threaten to raise tariffs on American goods (I hope not, I don't want to have to pay more).  Regardless I hope Starmer has played a blinder in this deal (or the concept of one) and used Trumps desperation to save face",PenitentGhost,2025-05-08T08:10:31,2
"The trade surplus is what he’s after. He heard that probably in a meeting and wants to use that to sell the public his whole “trade wars are easy” rhetoric. He’ll definitely take ownership of the surplus as a result of his policies while the Brits blink and shrug and agree to better terms for themselves. One thing though, I haven’t read anything in this deal about American health insurance companies. I’ve read a few past articles of these companies trying to gain better access in the UK and in these same articles there were conservative MP’s wanting to do away with the NHS and replace it with an American system. Yes, what a horrible idea so it’s easy to assume Trump would push this with the backing of the American insurance lobby. I just haven’t read anything about it in this sudden announcement of this agreement.",janzeera,2025-05-08T10:00:15,1
"> accepting lower food standards as the price of entry  Hey, hey, hey! Our food exports may be of lower quality than what you’re used to, but it’s also unhealthy and taste like shit! Oh, wait…",AmrokMC,2025-05-08T07:46:12,8
"Since all the funny math is not about tarrifs, but trade balance, it means this agreement doesn't do a damn thing.",rapidcreek409,2025-05-08T07:48:49,1
"It’ll knock off at least some of the tariffs on British steel and cars in return for knocking off at least some of the tariffs on American cars and lowering the rate their mega corps pay the digital service tax at.   I suspect it’s not much more than that, since Trump is calling it ‘comprehensive’ and the UK is calling it ‘no comment on that’.",Drolb,2025-05-08T09:29:54,1
