"A federal appeals court on Monday denied a request from President Donald Trump's administration to proceed with revoking temporary legal status for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela living in the United States.  GOOD!",TLakes,2025-05-05T16:59:21,60

"If the US wants to kick everyone out and isolate themselves from the world, becoming a pariah state, then go on ahead. My concern is that they have the largest military the world has ever seen, and sooner or later they are going to want to use it.",RampantJellyfish,2025-05-06T00:26:52,8

"Just before Amy Coney Barrett was formally nominated for the Supreme Court, I saw a video of one of her university presentations where she described that being judge requires courage and strong footing and character, because it's not about winning popularity contests, but enforcing the law as written, even when many people would hate it.  It was obvious to me that she was talking about necessity of overturning basic human rights that right wing radicals like her think are not protected by the constitution. But now, I appreciate her lesson, because what she said is now proven as holy truth.  You know what? It's crazy that only year ago, I was dreading over abortion being made illegal in half the states. But now I'm dreading about the solidly real possibility that America will irreversibly lose its very status of a constitutional republic and abortion will soon be the least of your worries.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-06T01:07:15,22

"The difference is that because the newly “illegal”immigrants were formerly legal living in the US, the administration knows their home and work addresses. ICE can more easily round them up and then hold press conferences announcing they’ve captured a ton of “illegal” immigrants “in” your community.",Gustapher00,2025-05-05T18:48:54,68
"Yeah, the Supreme Court will probably reverse the appeal court’s ruling until they have time to hear and decide the case. In that time, ICE will deport a bunch of people legally living in the US and ultimately nothing will happen to rectify their situation even if the Supreme Court ultimately decides against the administration (but they won’t).",Gustapher00,2025-05-05T18:51:38,24

"A military needs money to function. It needs oil, it needs parts, it needs a lot of things that will absolutely stop them in their tracks if they lose trade or get cut off.   If the world dumps USD then it’s over as the soldiers will all go home. They aren’t going to risk their lives and work for free.",BicycleOfLife,2025-05-06T00:45:50,5

I hope you're wrong. Does POTUS even have the power to take away legal status of 500 thousand legal immigrants?,Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-06T01:09:30,2
"And that's only my second biggest worry. Will this ever end, is the question. Holocaust survivors were lucky that the genocide happened in Europe and was committed by a dipshit warmonger who managed to get himself sandwiched by 2 ultra powerful military superpowers he thought he could defeat at once.  America on the other hand Is virtually invasion proof. Even if Europe grew a pair and decided to save America like America once saved Europe, it would be extremely costly. Today, American military is the strongest the world has ever seen and Europe is weak as hell. There have been talks about rearming in the EU, but it's all talk and no walk. I worry that this time, America must help itself.",Proud3GenAthst,2025-05-06T01:26:29,0
