I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that Les Mis is one of Trump’s favorite musicals. Does he not understand what it’s about?,eloi,2025-05-07T17:14:13,5697
"That musical?  Les Miserables.  >*Les Misérables* has several shades of meaning in French. Translators say that Victor Hugo’s novel, published in 1862, could just as well be titled *The Miserable Ones, The Outcasts, The Wretched Poor, The Victims* or *The Dispossessed*.  -- [definition from here](https://www.thirteen.org/blog-post/les-miserables-series-characters-misery/)  One wonders why he likes watching people suffer, the wretched poor, the outcasts....",akadaedalus,2025-05-07T17:16:53,883

He can't possibly identify with Jean Valjean or Javert - redemption and rigid adherence to the law are two things he doesn't understand.

But thinking that “Les Misérables” is “non-woke” is so incredibly stupid. Victor Hugo would like to have a word.  But what else would you expect from the modern day Thenardier? Maybe he likes it because he relates to the song “Master of the House” and imagines that the Thenardiers are the stars because they make him laugh.  What a boob.   Classless & Clueless.

"Trump's Les Mis:  ""OK folks, listen — this is a tremendous story. Tremendous. Nobody talks about it, but I know all the details. I know more about Les Misérables than Victor Hugo, frankly. Lotta people are saying that.”  “So there’s this guy — Javert. Very strong man. Law and order. The best. A real patriot, OK? He believes in rules, not chaos like the radical left in Paris. He sees this low-energy guy — Jean Valjean — total disaster, total criminal. Stole a loaf of bread, and you know what? He didn’t stop there. No, he kept escaping! Dishonest guy. Very sneaky.”  “Javert says, ‘You do the crime, you do the time,’ right? Very simple. But all the weak people — the liberals — they go, ‘Oh, Valjean changed! He’s nice now!’ They made him a mayor, folks. Can you believe that? A criminal. Running a town. Sounds familiar, doesn’t it?”  “So Javert — he doesn’t quit. He’s like me, he keeps going. Strong. Relentless. Follows Valjean for years. And then — get this — he’s undercover, inside this ANTIFA-style rebellion. They’ve got red flags, they’re building barricades, total mess. And Valjean — the criminal — he’s helping them! That’s what the left does.”  “And what happens? Valjean catches Javert and lets him go. Lets him go! And now Javert’s thinking, ‘What is this? What kind of system lets a crook be the hero?’ And he’s right, folks. He’s 100% right. He was the only one who believed in justice. The ONLY one. Incredible man. Tremendous man. And honestly, very sad what happens to him.”  “But remember this: in the end, Javert — he stood for law and order. He stood when no one else would. He didn’t flip. He didn’t cry. He didn’t write a book deal. He had integrity. Total integrity. Amazing guy. Really underrated. We love Javert.”",kmontreux,2025-05-07T22:26:13,6

"Not having seen the play I asked DeepSeek about it. After explaining the basics, I told it how I thought it was ironic it was that Trump liked it consider its themes of Forgiveness, Mercy, Love & Sacrifice.  However, I pointing out, Trump is probably twisting things around in the way he calls the January 6 crowd as ""freedom fighters"" and ""political prisoners"" and how he wanted to show them ""mercy"" by pardoning them all, including those who were going to bring guns.  After a bit of detail, DeepSeek concludes:  The Ultimate Irony   Les Mis is anti-authoritarian and pro-compassion—Valjean’s arc is about breaking free from an unjust system to serve others, not to seize power. Meanwhile:  * Trump’s version of ""mercy"" is transactional (protecting loyalists). * His ""revolution"" is reactionary (restoring his own rule, not liberating the oppressed). * The real Les Mis rebels would’ve been appalled by Jan. 6’s goals (disenfranchising voters to keep a leader in power).  Conclusion: A Weaponized Musical:   Trump’s use of Les Mis is a classic case of aesthetic appropriation—latching onto the grandeur and emotion of the music while inverting its actual message. It’s no different than far-right groups co-opting punk rock or white nationalists misusing Pepe the Frog.  Final Thought: If Trump ever actually watched Les Mis instead of just blasting the soundtrack, he’d probably side with the Thénardiers—the grifters who sing ""Master of the House"" while picking pockets.  note: the replies were AI-generated, for reference only.",FormerDittoHead,2025-05-08T11:20:10,1

"From Wikipedia:  > ""Born in the U.S.A."" has been widely misunderstood.[10][11][12] It has been treated as a flag-waving paean to America by politicians like Ronald Reagan and Pat Buchanan, reacting to the patriotic tone of the song's chorus, without seeming to acknowledge the bitter critique of American policy and society present in the lyrics.[12][10] The song presents a disillusioned Vietnam veteran as a tragic figure alienated upon his return from the war.  > Historians Jefferson Cowie and Lauren Boehm, writing in American Quarterly journal, identified three main themes. First, the emotional structure of the song with tension between a repetitive chorus of jingoism and narrative verses of resentful disillusionment. Second, the Vietnam War as symbols, ""to the social and economic siege of American blue-collar communities."" Third, ""economic devastation, which uproots the material basis of working-class identity only to replant it in the acidic soil of nationalism."" The article quotes Springsteen saying that the working-class man was facing,   > > ""a spiritual crisis, in which [he] is left lost. It's like he has nothing left to tie him into society anymore.

The song he's writing is supposed to be a callback to the group's previous song, ""*Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?*"" from the group's first album (and also written by Lamm).     So Lamm wrote: ""Feeling like I ought to sleep. Spinning room is sinking deep. Searching for something to say. Waiting for the break of day. Should I try to do some more? Twenty-five or six to four.""    Why that last bit? Because when he finished writing these lyrics, it was at 3:34 or 3:35 AM.    25 or 6 minutes before it got to be 4AM.  25 or 6 to 4.    That's when Lamm finished writing the song.    The group decided that Peter Cetera was the better voice to sing it, and Lamm agreed. THAT'S what the song means.
