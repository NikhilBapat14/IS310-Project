There are a lot of questions here - please make it clear either by quoting the question or referencing the number to keep this all sane and organized.,AuditorTux,2024-08-14T12:50:36,1
"I think that your questions are wrongly conceived, and that in itself is part of the problem (I mean that not as an attack on the question but as an honest response/part answer). Maybe I'm not too educated on this but:  **Point 1:** ""***bastion of Western culture?***"" I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that ""Israel \[is\] seen as a bastion of Western culture"" from. But since you are asking what the bases for that might be, you imply those are what people's opinion are, although I do not think that is the actual idea people have.  **Point 2:** On  ""***Implications of Israel’s Fall:***"" seeing this as a issue of or an attempt for the fall or otherwise of a nation is part of the problem; it allows people to peddle or buy into propaganda, lean into their biases, etc. to create or falsify their own justifications for their entrenched positions and fight, rather than address the legal or other actual bases for the conflict, through which solutions can be found. It's like you complaining that someone has come to rob your house (and fighting them for that reason), and, when asked, instead of that person responding to the claim of robbery and reason for the conflict, talking about ""that guy doesn't want me alive;"" diversion; they've made up their own cause for the fight.  ""***How might the fall of Israel affect Western civilization and global geopolitics?***""  1. Again, associating this with ""western civilization"" ""western democracy"" is very common propaganda tactics that the U.S. especially uses to give itself legitimacy to engage in conflicts it otherwise does not have a bases for. By using such approaches it now makes it its fight as well -- easy to rope in its citizen's support as well -- while skirting the actual cause of conflict/problems. Also, what is ""western civilization"" in this day and age? One moment people want to use that term, another moment the same people want to shy from it when it becomes inconvenient. 2. Now, even if Israel were to lose in this conflict (lose being, being proven to have no case for its actions and remedies thus being sought), it's not going to do anything to ""global geopolitics."" What is Israel in international politics? Not many countries can presume such importance that anything happening to them would so dramatically affect the world; countries that can lay that claim can mostly do so on the bases of their economic strength and significance. The only connection/interest most of those that support Israel have is 1) Christianity: religion, the thing that has blinded humanity and given it cause for injustice to date. And yet an Israeli ""loss"" will do nothing to Christianity except hurt the pride of those who have made that (religious difference) their bases for war 2) for those actually stoking the war, private business interests. These are individual private interests and has no implications for international politics. 3) I think that some people, perhaps Germans, may be sympathetic towards Israel because of the guilt they feel towards them with respect to past troubles they've been subject to. Again, no impact on global politics.  **Point 3:** Again, what do you mean by ""western influence?"" Also, whatever that is, the war is not about it -- pushing that is just the typical strategy of propagandists -- there have been specific causal factors or points for conflict that need to be addressed.  **Point 4:** I can't speak for leftists or rightists or whatever other forms of associations and labeling people choose to use, I only speak on specific issues, and the facts and logic therein, so I'll skip this.  **Point 5:** If Western Culture were to decline? Alternatives to Western Culture? Again, this kind of talk, all part of the problem; and often comes from those who actually do not have just cause.",fletcher-g,2024-08-14T14:37:09,6
"Just a question about the premise in #1... *Is* Israel seen by anyone as a bastion of Western culture?  When I think of the gigantic concept that is ""Western Culture,"" I think of Greco-Roman political influence, the historical impact of Christianity, the arts of the Renaissance and the philosophy of the Enlightenment. Israel (as opposed to the Jewish people) didn't exist for most of that.",Arthur_Edens,2024-08-14T13:56:58,3

"Sorry for the brevity. Western culture is not an issue here, but I concur that Israel is much more of a Western society than its neighbors, most of whose governments are based on authoritarian principles. In Israel, people aren't afraid to speak their minds and to disagree with their neighbors.   Looking at the current conflict, Israel's staunchest opponents belong to the Axis of Resistance, a group of governments and organizations hostile to everything most of us associate with the idea of Western values (I won't argue here in favor or against Western values but I assume you have your own opinions on that).   Also consider that Hamas is sworn to the total destruction of Israel. Israel and Hamas can never be at peace, because one can't tolerate the other's existence. A victory for Hamas would be a severe blow to the West. ",TheLeftHandedCatcher,2024-08-15T05:26:21,0
