"So what you're saying is this is a fuck up that was compounded by other fuck ups which has so far resulted in hundreds of lawsuits that eventually will be paid for by us the taxpayers. What the article didn't mention is how many lives were disrupted, how much money was lost by the students, their families, and the universities. Not to .mention the chilling effect that that has had on some of the brightest students from around the world who have wanted to come study and bring their gifts to the United States and now are choosing other countries. The net effect of this is a catastrophic fuck up and yet Trump and his minions will ride off into the sunset leaving us to hold the bag.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-30T02:15:39,8
