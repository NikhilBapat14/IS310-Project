"Americans are already paying a $350,000 more for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the most expensive socialized system on earth. Half a million dollars more than peer countries on average, yet every one has better outcomes. The impact of those costs is unspeakable.   36% of US households with insurance put off needed care  [due to the cost](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/surveys/2023/oct/paying-for-it-costs-debt-americans-sicker-poorer-2023-affordability-survey); 64% of households without insurance.

Christian folks use prayer and hypocrisy to treat their ailments. The hippies use herbs and crystals. The rest of us who actually use medicine as a treatment are royally screwed.,Financial-Special766,2025-04-25T22:47:05,2

So the tariffs will bring $51 billion a year into the government. And what's the plan for that money? Maybe they could use it to fund a program to reduce the price of pharmaceuticals by up to $51 billion a year.,30mil,2025-04-26T06:13:48,1
