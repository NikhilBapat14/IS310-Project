"It’s been made abundantly clear that there is no scenario where that monster gets to live in the United States again. So, why am I paying for a politician to influence internal affairs in another country?",rdenghel,2025-04-22T11:53:23,6
"""why am I paying for a politician to influence internal affairs in another country?""  We've been paying for our government to influence internal affairs in foreign countries for a long time.  For example:  ""Over the past decade (2015-2024), the United States has provided Nigeria with $7.8 billion in foreign aid, according to data from the US Foreign Assistance.""   But what makes that even better is that Nigeria is currently under a Level 3 travel advisory ""Reconsider travel to Nigeria due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed gangs. Some areas have increased risk.""   $7.8 billion later and Nigeria is still a shithole.  That's a tangent, but whether it's scumbag democrats advocating for a gangbanger, wife beater, human trafficker or billions in aid to absolute shitholes, Americans come last.",cossbobo,2025-04-22T14:39:36,0
