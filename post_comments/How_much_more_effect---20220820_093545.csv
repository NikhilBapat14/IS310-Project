"In general, a parliamentary system would be more effective at enacting the executive branch's legislative agenda. In a parliamentary system the executive branch leads the legislative process based on the support it receives from the majority of its membership. If a prime minister doesn't enjoy the support of their legislature they usually don't get to remain in office. If the legislature can't select anyone to be prime minister it usually results in early elections.  In a presidential system the executive and legislative branch are more independent from each other. Using the US as an example you have a greater chance of a divergence of opinion between the executive and legislative branch then you would in a parliamentary system. The president, representatives, and senators are all elected at different times, for different term lengths. The president being elected every 4 years, Representatives being elected every two years, and senators serving 6-year terms staggered into two-year intervals between three senatorial classes.  In contrast in a parliamentary system the prime minister is chosen almost immediately after the parliament is elected. The odds of them differing on opinion is smaller. But it's not impossible.  Parliamentary systems can gridlock too under the right circumstances. Famously, this happened in Belgium about a few years ago. A parliament was elected that was too fragmented to choose a prime minister, but was unwilling to call an early election. The Belgian Parliament went 592 days without choosing a prime minister. That became a world record.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-08-20T20:10:34,7
"Parliaments are usually much more vertically integrated with the majority coalition in Parliament selecting the Prime Minister. Therefore they are much more effective at passing legislation.   But two caveats. When the majority coalition in Parliament breaks down, the government also breaks down and you get No Confidence Votes and Dissolution of Parliament. The US Executive just keeps trucking regardless of Congress. Also, the US system was originally design to be intentionally more difficult to pass legislation.",SovietRobot,2022-08-20T22:29:42,2
"This is a very difficult question to answer in some ways because obviously there isn't a set, specific, single answer. Some parliamentary systems are more effective than others, both from a structural standpoint and from an internal political standpoint. Same could be said with presidential systems. So it really helps to be specific about a certain parliamentary system or a certain presidential system and then explain what kind of factors could make the answer change.   The other issue here is that even within a single system, there is a great deal of variation. For example, look at the US. Biden has accomplished much more legislation than Trump did despite it being the same system. Much of Biden's specific electoral appeal was his ability to work more effectively with Congress and achieve legislation other candidates can't. Is Biden's relatively productive legislative record a confirmation of that? Or is it a more of a political matter where the conditions of the country spur a greater need for action that has little to do with Biden's specific legislative talents? Or is it something else entirely? It depends on who you ask.  Simply put, any answer here will be in VERY broad strokes, and it will be quite easy to dive in and create more of a gray area if you're too focused on the specifics.  That said, I'm going to use the USA as my ""typical"" presidential system and the UK as my ""typical"" parliamentary system. The reason for this is that the primary difference between a presidential system and a parliamentary one is the degree to which majoritarianism is embraced. In a presidential system, majoritarianism is to a certain degree intentionally obscured using separation of powers and potentially other mechanics such as bicameralism, federalism, and more. In a parliamentary system, particularly an archetypal Westminster model like we see in the UK, those mechanics are intentionally NOT present to better protect majoritarian values.  As a general rule, when there are less barriers to a majoritarian system, legislation is more effective. As a general rule, the great strength of a Westminster model is parliament is quite good a passing laws when the public wants them to be passed. Especially compared to a presidential system, a parliament will be much more effective at passing laws.  Of course, that can be played with. If a parliamentary system embraces mechanics that weaken the majoritarian values, then the legislature will be less effective. Italy is a good example. They have a bicameral legislature, unlike many parliamentary systems, and they are notorious for experiencing a gridlock problem more similar to the US. Another factor that could weaken parliamentary effectiveness is when the party system is particularly proportional to the point that many, many parties weaken majoritarian governments. Israel is a good example here. Even after an election, Israel often has a lot of uncertainty and political wrangling to form a government as the many small parties complicated the Knesset. The UK with its non-proportional voting does not have this problem.  Similarly, presidential systems certainly could be more effective than the US has been historically. The US's polarization problem is a lot worse with mechanics like the filibuster (the Framers were clear a supermajority mechanic in the legislature was a TERRIBLE idea), high degrees of federalism, and bicameralism. However, it does seem most political systems prefer the advantages of a parliamentary system. Presidential systems are much less common in today's world.",mormagils,2022-08-22T09:13:01,1
"One difference to bear in mind, too, is that in a system like the US's, legislators don't actually have to care if legislation fails. It's possible for the rational choice for a legislator to introduce a bill their constituents will like that stands no chance of passing just to help that elected official next election.",[deleted],2022-08-20T21:46:19,2
