"Be fair he has golfing to do and deep fake AI stuff to make.  He's very busy all the time defending himself on x from all the sane people trying to dampen his mood.  It's all too much for one orange to handle.  Also, there's that damn constitution getting in the way of all his dictatorship plans.  ",arilupe,2025-05-04T20:16:04,1
