"No.  It used to be that you could have worked for conservative political organizations and still get a job in liberal organizations but if you worked in liberal organizations, conservative organizations wouldn't hire you.  Now the ostracization seems to go both ways. If you work for a politicized organization, you're kind of stuck with that side.",Volsunga,2024-06-20T21:25:12,18
"You know a bit of how the other party thinks. I would always find that helpful.   As an aside, unpaid internships are some bullshit right there.",knockatize,2024-06-21T04:56:14,4
"If there is a way for you to talk about the kinds of skills you performed or acquired from these jobs, without stating the political affiliation you might be able to leverage the job experience, listing it under ""other experience"" so as not to trigger those who might be screening candidates.   In the current climate, people are pettier than ever and it's likely that you'll be rejected for partisan reasons by revealing a heavy slant, particularly when applying for GOP positions. This is because, as a lifelong Independent, the GOP has become far more extreme than it has ever been in our lifetimes. Sadly, there is a notable increase in domestic terrorists among them who are armed and dangerous and looking for an opportunity to use the weapons they've been stock-piling.   We need more balanced voices on both sides so my hope is that it will come from an influx of young, unpoisoned, unentitled, collaborative minds.If you can genericize your past Dem work to focus on the learnings that came from it, you have a better shot at being valued for those GOP opportunities that come your way. The same approach will work on the Dem side but their reaction to you is likely to be much less extreme and dogmatic, from what I'm seeing.   Good luck with your quest.",NeatNefariousness1,2024-06-21T08:47:12,4

">This guy is a Republican (not a crazy one, just one of those old 90s reaganite guys).  There are no moderate Republicans. If you have 10 people at a table that are Nazis and you're at the table too, you know what you have at that table? 11 Nazis. All the moderate Republicans are kicked out of the party and there's no stopping the MAGA bus from driving off the cliff.",livinginfutureworld,2024-06-21T08:35:44,3
"I'm the only person in my family who is not a Republican and I have to keep it a secret to keep the peace. They don't even use words like ""democrat"" or ""liberal"" - they say ""demonrats"" and ""libtards"". My father gave me a list of Republicans to vote for when I was in college and yelled at me when I said I wasn't going along with that.  I'll admit that I've never worked in politics. But I know a lot of Republicans, and they will not take kindly to progressive work on your resume.",acl2244,2024-06-21T10:22:14,1
"Just put ""confidential"" instead of the name of the organization.  That way you can put your relevant skills and qualifications, without outing yourself.",BubblelusciousUT,2024-06-21T12:13:00,1
You can also put NDA with your job title at the prior org. That way they get a general idea of the work you did without telling exactly who you worked for.,BubblelusciousUT,2024-06-21T12:15:18,1
"Theodore Roosevelt was the best progressive Republican that there ever was but I'm afraid that times have changed. People associate progress with being a ""woke liberal"" and that doesn't look well to a politician who is trying to represent his or her party in today's world.",Progressive-Change,2024-06-22T00:11:08,1
">I will be resigning in november upon his endorsement of Donald Trump  I'm puzzled why you want this internship. As bad as you think a college Democratic club looks to a Republican, imagine how much worse interning for a Republican on the Hill will look to any democrat/progressive organization. That seems to be your leaning. As someone who has been in the DC political world for over 15 years, I strongly advise you pick a party lest you limit your career potential. Now if this is just for fun and you don't want a career in politics, more power to you.",FiveDollarHoller,2024-06-23T12:14:53,1
"Reagan used to be a Democrat and Hillary Clinton a young Republican, it’s probably OK.  Talk about how you align with the office holder and want to help elevate those particular ideas.",rethinkingat59,2024-06-20T20:49:14,-1

"It's another way of filtering out the poor. The voices that will be heard regularly are of those who are provided for, ensuring policy continues to favor the well off. I doubt it's accidental .",amytyl,2024-06-21T06:52:51,1
"yeah i agree but this does offer a stipend at the minimum wage level.   Plus since I’m just a high schooler, already have a pretty sweet serving job and my family is upper middle class, i would honestly be fine doing this unpaid for a bit",[deleted],2024-06-22T16:02:32,1
"yeah i think it’d be good. Founded a non partisan policy non profit is the big one. Have a youth outreach role with the local historical society. lead in school debate Social Studies Honor Society president and good academics, etc. Think I should be good?",[deleted],2024-06-20T19:40:21,4
yeah i’m not here to try and disagree with you my friend. I’m a bigtime progressive for pretty much all my work outside so i don’t need convincing. I’m just making the point that he isn’t super rhetorically out there. I’m sure you probably wouldn’t even know his name.  Plus the big ethical consideration for me is the right wing rhetorical/ “culture warriors” thus guy doesn’t fall into this camp so to me it’s tenable,[deleted],2024-06-21T08:47:55,1
