Trump is barely coherent now. In another 3 years they’ll be propping him up and holding his water for him,Sufficient-Opposite3,2025-04-04T18:09:45,143
"Absolutely not. The Democrats need to be adamant that any attempt at a third term is unambiguously unconstitutional. If Trump does this, it's not ""pushing a legal boundary"", it's committing a crime.",Voltage_Z,2025-04-04T18:08:32,404
"No, the current legislation they are pushing says,  Third term for a president who did NOT serve two consecutive terms.   It is designed to intentionally block Obama, Bush, and Clinton.",Turds4Cheese,2025-04-04T18:05:54,359
It almost seems pointless to consider this hypothetical because we all know Obama would never do it.,GreenZebra23,2025-04-04T18:31:34,19
"No, absolutely not. Don’t legitimize trumps unconstitutional actions by running Obama. This isn’t a tit for tat moment. You run a democratic candidate and you don’t acknowledge Trump as a legitimate candidate whatsoever. No state puts him on the ballot or accept any of his actions. States can instead recognize the democratic president as the true president. We can build up a government away from Washington. We will see if the military will answer to the fake president which is Trump or the legitimate president which will be the Democrat in this case.  I think outlining how the country will have to choose a legitimate president state by state would scare people into not letting Trump be on the ballot. It doesn’t matter if the Supreme Court says Trump is legit or not. The constitution’s word is final and the states have the right to uphold it.",JPenniman,2025-04-04T18:28:35,31
I don't think he wants to step back into this current mess. Trump isn't going to run again. Blue states aren't going to allow him to be on the ballot. Elections are run by the states according to the same constitution that says he can't run again.,JFeth,2025-04-04T18:10:23,12

My understanding is that the path for Trump is to be appointed speaker by a republican house then have the (presumably republican) president and vice president step down. I have not heard plans for him to actually run. This skirts the constitutional amendment and weasels in around the “shall not be elected to” part. In this case I’m not sure how Obama runs for speaker or if a republican ticket would step down for him to ascend to the presidency. I’m sure SCOTUS would have to get involved if this occurs. This does raise the stakes for 2026 house seats.,yubathetuba,2025-04-04T18:56:00,3

Far as I'm concerned and there are many who agree with me because Obama was President for 8 years is the reason Trump was elected regardless of what he did and said. They were expecting / hoping for mass deportations then and now as well as a purging of criminals.    Trump's blundering of covid put Biden in office, and maybe most of the Democrats hoped Obama would be an advisor.    And considering how the Republicans did former president Obama and said they would fight him at every turn from the very beginning of his presidency, I hope former president Obama does not try to run again if that were made possible. ",Objective-Ad-2799,2025-04-07T20:27:58,1

If there is no such evidence, it gets much murkier, but at the end of the day the courts would still be trying to determine what the 22A authors intended - that’s the question of merit.  If those of us against Trump 3 cannot demonstrate the authors would object to Trumps scheme, it will be hard to otherwise argue we shouldn’t just let the people decide.",InCarbsWeTrust,2025-04-05T11:17:09,3

It's the most consequential technicality in the history of American law, but I think it is a genuine loophole.
