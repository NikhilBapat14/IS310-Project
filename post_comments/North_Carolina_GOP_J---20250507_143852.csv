The court ruled on 21 cases during this 6 month BS. If it were anyone else I would say that was the plan.  But I don’t have enough confidence these knuckleheads have that much common sense.,Adventurous-Bird-750,2025-05-07T16:18:26,81

"I'd say that the delay was what they were really after. Oh, sure, they would've taken the win if they could've gotten it, but a delay is useful, too- it results in less time for the Democrats to get stuff accomplished.",RightSideBlind,2025-05-07T17:55:06,40

According to the article her win changes nothing for the current gop majority in their state supreme court as it’s 5-2. But makes it possible for dems to retake the court in 2028.,seanisdown,2025-05-07T23:59:36,3
"Two recounts affirmed Riggs’ 734-vote margin of victory after the election, but Griffin, an appeals court judge, refused to concede and challenged the eligibility of more than [65,000 voters](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/12/north-carolina-judge-allison-riggs-won-two-recounts-republicans-are-still-trying-to-overturn-her-election/). He presented no evidence of illegal voting, but two GOP-dominated courts in North Carolina—the state of appeals and state Supreme Court—green-lit his scheme to throw out enough votes to potentially [reverse Riggs’ win](https://www.wral.com/story/nc-supreme-court-votes-to-throw-out-some-but-not-all-ballots-contested-in-2024-race-for-seat-on-court/21955935/).",StoneWall_MWO,2025-05-07T18:04:45,11
"This is correct the stall / delay tactic…it’s very commonly used by the Conservative Party to disenfranchise what is a legitimate loss or what they perceive as a failure. Sometimes it works, this time it didn’t.",Obi-Wan-Oblivious,2025-05-07T18:23:28,27

"Same reason they’re so obsessed with changing voter id and registration laws all the time.  It isn’t just about everyone eventually having the right kind of ID or the right documents to register, the introduction of a change in requirements causes a delay where some percentage of people who were going to vote in an election no longer can meet the requirements in time.  It doesn’t matter if 100% of eligible voters eventually get the right ID, because by the time they do so the consequential election,(like 2016, which trashed the Supreme Court) will have already passed, and the change in requirements will have altered the vote totals.",suddenlypandabear,2025-05-07T22:27:07,11
