"By its academic definition, no it is not being taught in regular schools.  Critical race theory, academically, is something that would only come up in law school or in graduate school in certain disciplines.  When republicans talk about CRT, they mostly mean 'anything race-related that I don't like', and they just call it all CRT.  They also misrepresent what's actually being taught quite a bit in those cases.",zlefin_actual,2023-01-28T09:46:12,7
"It depends what you mean by ""schools.""  ""Schools"" as in K-12, kind of?  CRT is an academic concept and more of a framework to examine historical events and perspectives. It's not something that you can teach per say and it's definitely not something you can use to teach math or science or subjects like that.  It's like saying ""They're using the scientific method to teach English!"" It doesn't really work like that.  At the base, CRT literally just says that laws and social developments are shaped in part by social conceptions of race and ethnicity - the racial/ethnic history of a place impacts how the laws and society develops.  That's it. That's literally it.  To say in a class ""Laws have been made with the intent to focus on specific racial communities"" is something that no one who had a rational view of history would argue with. ""Critical race theory"" a five dollar word to talk about that.   So you *could* say that CRT is being taught in schools but all that is is putting a name to the acknowledgement that race plays a part in the social and legal developments of a nation.",HeloRising,2023-01-26T02:16:56,3
I think “critical race theory” has simply become a bogeyman word used to stoke the fiery emotions of their voter base.  Not unlike “communist” or “woke”.   I think those pushing against it know the least about it.,MAGICHUSTLE,2023-02-19T09:07:19,2
"First tell me what CRT is and I’ll tell you if it’s being taught or not. But in all seriousness, there is no consensus on what CRT is within right wing groups so no not really. What is being taught is history which often includes mention of race and such topics due their prominence in US History.",Phantom78611,2023-04-10T16:17:25,1
">When republicans talk about CRT, they mostly mean 'anything race-related    that I don't like', and they just call it all CRT.  They also    misrepresent what's actually being taught quite a bit in those cases.  This can largely be traced back to one conservative activist: Christopher Rufo.  Rufo described his strategy to oppose critical race theory as intentionally using the term to conflate various race-related ideas in order to create a negative association.  Rufo said that ""\[w\]e will eventually turn \[critical race theory\] toxic,  as we put all of the 'various cultural insanities' under that brand category. The goal is to have the public read something 'crazy' in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory'.""  The idea was to basically conflate any liberal social/cultural talking point with ""CRT.""",SilverHawk7,2023-02-03T11:05:01,3
"Funnily enough, I'm sure there are curriculum being written now specifically on CRT because of all of the uproar. It's definitely a sociological occurrence worth studying in depth now. All the backlash is likely creating the thing it was so concerned about, and I'm here for it. :)",Briepy,2023-02-16T15:13:31,1
