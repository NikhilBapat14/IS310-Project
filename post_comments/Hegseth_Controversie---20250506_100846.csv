"***From Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez:***  Pete Hegseth has already displayed a predictable lack of competence in his role as defense secretary, but it’s not just a sloppy use of Signal chats that has forced the White House to do damage control on his behalf. According to a Tuesday report from Reuters, early in his tenure Hegseth cancelled military aid to Ukraine without a direct order from President Donald Trump.

"Actually you're asking a really reasonable question. I worked as a project program manager in the IT world for 26 years (Amazon, Starbucks, Verizon...)  I always thought that move fast and break things was stupid, because unfortunately, it ends up happening to production environments.   See, the companies are too cheap to build out full test environments for their production environments. So dumbass programmers who like to move fast and break things tend to move shit to production and then everything breaks.   It's okay, they'll fix it later.   I can't tell you how many times I've run into this and the IT world where people think they can do whatever the F they want and they'll just be able to fix it later.  Why do they do it? They're lazy. That's why they do it. Planning takes time. Planning takes thought. Planning takes maturity.

"The IT usage is usually wrong anyway. But the idea is that large amounts of institutional inertia become invested in the way things are currently done because everyone has aligned themselves to profiting or at least surviving that way.  Not to defend specific companies, but like Uber and Lyft only have a business model because taxi and public transit services in some countries have been disasters for decades. That's rarely something the existing ossified institutions are going to fix. But if you just break things and keep going and hope it works out, sometimes you get the unicorn that actually does change things and now they've leveraged that into worldwide businesses even in places where taxis and transit were fine.  Software design and business models that are willing to accept higher failure rates and eating costs in the short term can work. But a lot of them don't. And once you start talking about not being able to dump your failure costs on public spheres, the question of ""can we move fast and break ... military defense?"" sounds a lot different.",og_murderhornet,2025-05-06T15:28:36,3

"Isn’t laziness one of the three virtues of a programmer?  (Copied -  “According to Larry Wall, the original author of the Perl programming language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience and Hubris  Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Impatience: The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

"Meh... I'm a computer engineer (who's also worked for Verizon) and this is kind of a pessimistic view to take and not entirely accurate. Devs and Engineers aren't ""breaking shit"" because they are lazy or don't have the budget to build a full Test environment, at least not universally and I suspect not the majority of the time.  There are two main types of project styles with lots of subtypes. The two main types are the traditional Waterfall, and the newer Agile.  Waterfall is a linear project management approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next, with a focus on upfront planning and fixed requirements. It is best for projects with clear, unchanging goals, and works best on infrastructure and hardware projects. Agile, on the other hand, is an iterative approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It breaks the project into smaller, manageable tasks or sprints, allowing for ongoing feedback and adjustments, making it more suitable for projects with evolving requirements. This typically works best in the software world.  Assuming you have competent project managers, devs, and engineers, the problems usually occur where the two styles eventually come together. For example, the scenario of ""move fast and break shit"" happens when you have a high up tech manager who came from the software (agile) world, and they want to now run the entire company as agile as possible. Well guess what, agile is not great for infrastructure and hardware, and all of the sudden your infra starts breaking because they insist on installing bleeding edge firmware or putting all of their eggs in ""the new hotness"" such as cloud or AI when not everything should be on the cloud or run by AI and shit just breaks.  The opposite end of the problem is when your high up manager is an engineer who's used to the hardware (waterfall) world and tries to be wayyyyyy too safe and implements rigid and bureaucratic change controls where you have to fill out forms in triplicate and they scrutinize every single little line item on a project. This is fine in the hardware world where patching a server can potentially shut a bank down for 24 hours and affect an entire global economy (don't ask me how I know that one), however in the software world this is stifling and kills creativity. Software after all is what brings the money in for most companies, so the newer it is and the more features it has, the more money you make. You don't want to (nor should you) have to get multiple levels of approval just to work on fixing a bug in some code. That's actually what life was like prior to agile when everything was just run as waterfall.  Right now, since Agile is newer, it really is being leveraged way more hard than waterfall, and as a result most companies, if they don't find balance, tend to stray into the ""we are breaking shit and moving fast"" category. This isn't a good thing though, as any kind of instability is disruptive to your workflow. The best companies are able to leverage both Agile and waterfall and use them where they make the most sense.",MiserableSlice1051,2025-05-06T20:11:00,3
