"Seems like this was a channel for Forbes Under 30 before, [according to Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170926030243/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg40OxZ1GYh3u3jBntB6DLg). They changed the channel name in the url but you can still access the old archives through their id:      UCg40OxZ1GYh3u3jBntB6DLg  Not sure if there was a change of ownership but they rebranded to Forbes Breaking News around two years ago. Here's what their page looked like in: [Oct. 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001022307/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg40OxZ1GYh3u3jBntB6DLg). There were right-leaning videos back then but they started the hyper-partisan content by [early 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20210207013313/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg40OxZ1GYh3u3jBntB6DLg) and the channel grew exponentially from there.  Edit: Forbes is majority-owned by a [HK/China-based investment group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes#Sale_to_Integrated_Whale_Media_(51%_stake)) and is currently in negotiations to be acquired by billionaire Austin Russell so that could also be related.",MSSFF,2023-07-19T03:16:13,2
"Wow, I'm glad I found this post. I was thinking the same thing. I lean center-right, but the number of culture war gotcha moments I see from Forbes, IMO, should be zero. I want serious new coverage from Forbes, not this. Leave that to Ben Shapiro.  I'm glad to hear it's all going this way so I can remove the channel from my feed.",krustymeathead,2023-10-23T16:23:58,2
"I was wondering the same thing. It's been popping up on my feed consistently, but I don't even follow Forbes. It also has more subs (1m+) than the main page despite running from only 2017 vs 2006, plus an insane 78k video uploads vs 6k on the Forbes channel.  Could they have seen an opportunity to pander to a particular group and run with it? Or did someone take over that particular channel? The first video was only posted 2 years back.",Ondolo009,2023-12-22T18:26:26,2
The shift exists in the culture outside of the Forbes. The short answer here is ... it's now trendy and therefore profitable to post such content due to increase in viewership,RoyalReddit_PRO,2024-03-15T01:42:10,1
"I enjoy watching Forbes on YouTube because it covers Senate and House Sub-Commitee meetings that a real and unfiltered, but I'm starting to feel brainwashed because it's all slanted Right in its coverage. Are there similar sites showing the same kind of coverage (Senate hearings, etc) that are more neutral or even left-biased so I can strike a balance? PS: My political views are Center/Right but I have an open mind",Technical_Piccolo_30,2024-05-11T08:59:01,1
It’s constantly shoved down my throat even though I click not interested all the time. It’s ran by right winger nut jobs. It’s worse than fox. I have NEVER once watched a video from them yet it NEVER goes away. ,Taran_Tula9,2024-05-12T10:08:05,1
"It's gotten worse. That's what led me to do a Google search which led me to this Reddit post. Now it's just pure propaganda it seems. Do people on the board of Forbes even know this is going on or did some uninformed executives say : ""go do your little YouTube thing"" and someone is trying to push an agenda on that YouTube channel? Anyways, stay clear from it. ",ChrisCeeKayKelley,2024-05-17T20:24:25,1
I’m here looking for the same answer. I’m starting to suspect FBN is not actually run by he same folks as Forbes magazine.,Afraid-Tone5206,2023-07-12T17:36:06,1
In the beginning I was skeptical it was affiliated with Forbes given the egregious bias in their videos and especially in the titles. Had no idea Forbes was a right wing outlet.,rayansb,2023-08-10T11:21:57,1
"I don't think FBN is actually Forbes. They pretend to be to deceive you. Type forbes on the search box, and scroll down. Fbn is tricky and they beat yt algorithm. Don't think right wingers are not smart. :)",ProfessorOwn2674,2023-08-27T12:00:39,1

I couldn't agree with you more. They keep popping up on my YT feed too. And because they seem to really lean into the hyper partisan politics. If there was a way I could let YT know that I didn't ask for nor do I want to see their BS on my feed anymore.  Bur than again that would waste my precious time,Snoo61727,2024-01-21T22:50:50,1
"I noticed this, too. Today (February 11th, 2024) they have clips of the right-wing justices of the Supreme Court expressing disdain for the lawyers representing Colorado in the ballot case.",[deleted],2024-02-11T15:07:23,1
"When I swipe right on my phone, I get Forbes articles I enjoy reading on video games, movies, and TV shows.  But now, all of a sudden, on my YouTube feed, I am getting Forbes breaking news articles, and everyone is annoyingly right leaning.  It's like 2 different Forbes. The one I enjoy that gives centrist views and this FBN that panders to maga.",Sand_Asleep,2024-02-15T18:23:31,1
"I have been thinking the same thing too, myself for months I'm glad you brought it up. The obvious Clickbait titles are so egregious that part of me thinks that they are not related company wise. I never even considered that until someone in this comment thread brought up that possibility. On the other hand if they aren't related whatsoever, then why has Forbes proper not hit them with a cease-and-desist or flag them on YouTube? I don't know. I'm genuinely interested in the answer if anybody knows.",Efficient_Letter_910,2024-02-18T12:24:37,1
Ha this spooky. I got here googling the exact same question.  The right wing click bait and THOSE COMMENTS!!   I am also constantly shadow banned when trying to reply.,Andy_Bird,2024-03-02T04:31:46,1
Found this thread because I googled if that is actually Forbes or someone stealing their name. Most of the comments under those stupidly maga right leaning propaganda video pieces they post  are so oddly weird… like sound fake or like bot comments. Please tell me people aren’t really so gullible.,GreatCourt7422,2024-03-03T01:59:42,1
Yes! C-SPAN! I hope you stopped watching that channel by now. It seems to have gotten worse. That's how I stumbled upon this post. ,ChrisCeeKayKelley,2024-05-17T20:21:13,1
unfortunately it is. Their main forbes channel lists forbes breaking news as one of theirs.,rayansb,2023-08-10T11:20:43,1
"Maybe not, but it's still one of their main channels, which I find despicable and nauseating. The videos are just tabloid style trash pandering to the furthest of the right, and the most extreme of the MAGAs.",Slurpy2k17,2023-09-18T00:30:06,1

"Actually, you type forbes on the search box, the first one shows up in fbn, but if you scroll down you will see the actual forbes. Just because fbn is more active and has more subscribers. Tricky af.",ProfessorOwn2674,2023-08-27T11:41:32,1

"Popular culture has always acknowledged that there are masculine women and feminine men. I think it's the changing of language that many people don't understand. This idea that if you are feminine you are a woman etc.       Gender has historically been a synonym for sex. With it's Latin root word's meaning being grounded in biological reality rather than subjective interpretation: ""kind, sort, genus""",AxiomaticRain,2024-02-25T08:33:42,1
Yeah Forbes has many channels their main one is Forbes but they have other channels one of them is fbn. It is listed as one of their channels if you go to the forbes channel and click on the “channels” tab you will fbn as one of theirs.,rayansb,2023-08-27T12:01:39,1
"you are right. thanks. That makes sense. If someone pretends to be forbes, they would have flgged it, and the channel would have been blocked.",ProfessorOwn2674,2023-08-27T23:50:52,1
