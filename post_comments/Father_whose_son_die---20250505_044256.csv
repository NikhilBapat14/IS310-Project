"Just heart-breaking. Prayers for this father and all parents suffering similar tragedies.   Kids need to have it drilled into them that ANY street drug might contain fentanyl....and therefore, the ONLY way to ensure they don't fall prey to an overdose is to avoid ALL street drugs. There's no other option.",Vessarionovich,2025-05-05T05:08:48,39
">""It can happen to anyone, because my son looked me in the eye and said it would never happen to him,"" Muth told Fox News Digital. **""He said that all his friends have Narcan**, and so I think, first and foremost, if there's any notification that [kids are] dabbling in anything foreign on campus, get control of it immediately. Just make sure they stay away from anything and everything, and if you have to get them out of that school or that fraternity, because it's a real problem.""   It's tragic that a father lost his son, but the dad *had* to have known his son was a drug user based on that alone.   None of my friends carry narcan because none of us use drugs. Regular people don't carry around narcan ""just in case"".",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-05T09:06:25,17

Everyone that sells or distributes fentanyl should receive the capital punishment.,dankhorse25,2025-05-05T07:20:14,15
Weird that this article and the Narcan article are posted so close to each other and getting weird voting patterns.,sixtysecdragon,2025-05-05T08:59:40,4
"Someone in our family, asked for some pills to be delivered.  He was cramming for finals.  Parents could not reach him, went to his apartment and in his notebook, he wrote - Mom and Dad, so sorry for everything I have done.  Something is seriously different with these pills.  Father found him dead at his desk and the pills.",fisherman_23,2025-05-05T09:04:59,7
"Oregon was not fighting as a matter of fact they made it legal for a few years. I bet that is the pipeline that help flood the country. They have since re-criminalized Heroin and Fentanyl. Now if you are caught you are eligible for state PAID, meaning our taxes, rehab.   Make them dependent, then put them in rehab. Nice scam overall.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-05T08:33:31,1

"Sure, although many people are still forced into drug use (such as rape/sex-trafficking victims) or are otherwise in an impaired cognitive state (such as schizophrenia) which prevents informed consent. It's oftentimes not a clear choice.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-05-05T14:18:27,2

What good is it gonna do in your medicine cabinet?   Do you often invite drug users to your home?,Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-05T20:08:44,3
Rewards and up/down votes on this sub are meaningless because anyone can do it. The majority of reddit is left leaning and comes here to do stuff like that.,mojo276,2025-05-05T07:31:33,11
It’s the bots and progressives downvoting on every conservative comment on just about every Reddit sub.,MaBonneVie,2025-05-05T09:00:07,10
