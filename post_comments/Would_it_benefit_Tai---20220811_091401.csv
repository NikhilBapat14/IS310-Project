"Taiwan has dropped their (serious) claim of being the legitimate Chinese government years ago.   China on the other hand has very seriously stated that Taiwanese independence would be the same thing as a declaration of war to them.   So no, there is no way for Taiwan to ever get independence without there being either war or extreme changes in chinas political landscape.",Ferdi_cree,2022-08-11T19:09:04,15
I think the PRC would then proceed to attack Taiwan. The fiction that they are both the legitimate government of China allows for the continuation of the stalemate (if you can call it  that) tha ended the Chinese Civil War.,baylorguyinsa,2022-08-12T02:38:06,2
From an international political standpoint it wouldn’t make a difference. And I can’t imagine it would be good for anyone’s local politics to push for that.,gsfgf,2022-08-11T19:09:21,1
"I think if everyone but China publicly acknowledged it, that would be the biggest thing.",jeff8073x,2022-08-12T07:47:18,1
"Probably not. Whether or not they declared independence would have little bearing on who chose to recognize their independence - or why.  Potentially, Taiwan could use a declaration of independence to provoke China into an unwinnable war and marginalize it. However, this would be a very high risk strategy.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-13T16:08:48,1
"Taiwan imo likes this situation of limbo. They really only have to shift military positions to be defensive of a small island with dedicated relations to the rest of the democratic world. They really just have to focus on appeasing western powers enough so that they value their China relations over their Taiwan relations. The President has been a stateswoman for long enough to understand that being neither here nor there about ROC/PRC supremacy keeps everyone happy and safe even if China gets a little mad when Pelosi comes around. When you look at their political response to Pelosi coming, they express a quiet thank you and move on, not being super showboaty about having Pelosi be their friend for the week lol",QueasyMilhouse,2022-08-16T19:55:52,1
">Taiwan has dropped their (serious) claim  Uh, no they haven't. Taiwan's official state position is that they are still the rightful *de jure* successors to the government of China that formed after the overthrow of the Imperial system. It's an ongoing debate within Taiwan whether it should drop these claims or not, but it hasn't left the KMT party platform.",paceminterris,2022-08-11T21:19:07,4
"Minor correction; the ROC/Taiwan is *already* independent, the issue is simply the degree of formal international recognition. (informally, of course, countries certainly treat Taiwan as an actual country, such as adhering to its customs laws, border control, etc. separate from the PRC)  I agree that changing the language doesn't make a difference, of course. Ultimately, it's not about what's right, it's simply that China is powerful and wants to take something because it believes it can. It wouldn't be the first large power to do that, and it won't be the last.",funnytoss,2022-08-11T20:34:11,4

"Frankly that's a defunct plank of a party that (1) isn't in power and (2) isn't internally united on it, either. Younger KMT members legitimately don't care about territorial claims outside of what is already under the Taiwanese government. It's a hold-over from the colonial martial law era.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-12T19:13:42,1

">the issue is simply...international reconition  No it's not. Whether Taiwan considers itself to be independent or the *de jure* rightful government of all China is NOT some quibble; the fact that BOTH Taiwan and the PRC claim that there is only one Chinese government (they merely disagree on WHO it is) is pretty much the only reason there hasn't been serious violence across the strait for the past few decades.  Taiwan and the PRC are both able to exist in an uneasy gray equilibrium when both claim there is only one China. As soon as Taiwan claims unilateral independence, the PRC has no choice but to view it as an insurrectionary province.",paceminterris,2022-08-11T21:23:47,2
"I'd argue that 1) the KMT is not in power & 2) Taiwans military strategy has shifted from overtaking the mainland to defending itself from an Chinese invasion. Thus, claims about ""taking back mainland China because the ROC is the rightful government for all of China"" are nothing but an unbackable provocation or, as I understand it, a way of nullifying chinas claims about Taiwan by ""high level trashtalking"" something similar back.",Ferdi_cree,2022-08-12T09:13:56,1
"It’s easy to say democracy is bad when the only people using it are people unlike you. However, when there’s people that are basically just like you, but more free, it’s harder to ignore that reality.   It’s not entirely unlike North and South Korea.",GeorgieWashington,2022-08-12T04:45:52,2
"In addition to issues of ""face"" (wanting to prove itself strong, and taking territory that the Qing Dynasty lost to Japan in the Sino-Japanese war), strategically, China find itself in a better position if it can control Taiwan.  For example, China currently does not have direct access to the Pacific Ocean (but it would after annexing Taiwan), and so its submarines can be tracked much more easily once they leave port.  I would agree that in most ways, China can function perfectly well without Taiwan as a province (I mean, that's the reality of things). But people are rarely satisfied with what they have, and wanting even more is human nature.",funnytoss,2022-08-12T05:06:10,1
I think for the same reason no country in the world wants a big part of them to secede.   > There does not seem to be any cons for China if Taiwan does gain independence.  They would lose a highly important and strategic island with a population of 24 million people.,Hapsbum,2022-08-12T21:09:37,1
The People's Republic has been running under a policy of reclaiming all territories that onced belonged to China at some point in the past. Taiwan was a province of China before and China wants it back. Really it seems like the only reason they haven't asserted a claim is because of implied American intervention. Plus trade and tourism does happen between the two.,Shakezula84,2022-08-13T16:12:52,1

"The ROC and PRC both exist, and have some overlapping territorial terms (though obviously, the ROC doesn't actually have any interest/ability to actually try and enforce the claims, whereas the PRC does).  Both have international recognition, though obviously the PRC has a lot more of it (the ROC only has 13+1 diplomatic allies). That's what I was referring to when I was talking about ""degree of international recognition"". Hope that clarifies!  In real life, it also is absurd to think that most Taiwanese people actually think there is only one Chinese government. The fact that our government is separate is entirely mundane and just a fact. We pay taxes to the ROC, not the PRC. It's the ROC's laws that govern our daily lives, not the PRC's. Just wanted to make clear that at best, it's a theoretical competing claim, but in all practical aspects, the two have been separate from one another since forever. (well, the PRC and Taiwan have never been united, and the PRC and ROC... kind of)",funnytoss,2022-08-11T21:25:13,0
">As soon as Taiwan claims unilateral independence, the PRC has no choice but to view it as an insurrectionary province.  Quite the overstatement. Not entirely sure where the idea of 'no choice' came from - [the CCP's claim to Taiwan is relatively modern](https://thediplomat.com/2022/05/when-the-ccp-thought-taiwan-should-be-independent/) and was a deliberate policy choice after the civil war ended. The CCP could just as easily go ""OK, well we won't recognize you but this isn't worth fighting a war over.""

"Can't lose it if you don't have it.   Facts are facts: the PRC has literally never governed Taiwan. It doesn't collect taxes, it receives no resources, and the people are not PRC citizens. Taiwan is already de facto independent. Therefore, there's nothing to 'lose.' We should be more careful with our language on this.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-13T10:54:55,1
"They both agree to pretend.    ""There is only one China"" to the mainlanders means ""they will come around eventually, we can wait.""  If Taiwan declares independence and asserts authority over just Taiwan, then a hostile country just stole an island from China.    If Puerto Rico declared independence from the US, we would not let that stand, however credible or laughable the claim.    The PRC has agreed to pretend Taiwan is theirs and that's all anyone has been saying for decades.  If Taiwan Breaks the deal, they will feel forced to act.    Taiwan won't do it because their security guarantees with the US are not rock solid.  If the world thinks they provoked the war, the US could say ""screw that, let me have it."" And that would be that.  Their military would put up a good fight, but nothing short of a miracle would save them.

"Fun fact: The PRC does govern most of China and by its own admission the island of Taiwan is part of China.  There's a difference between a nation and a state. We've had nations with several states before, we've also had states that controlled several nations.  Taiwan is part of the Chinese nation, but not of the ""Chinese"" state which we should call PRC.  > We should be more careful with our language on this.  I fully agree.  That's why I prefer to use China to describe the entire nation, Taiwan for the island itself, PRC for the government that controls the mainland and ROC for the government that controls the island of Taiwan.  Using China/Taiwan to describe the governments is problematic because the issue is too complicated to make mistakes like that and I find it annoying that people use Taiwan and ROC interchangeable all the time; as with China and PRC.",Hapsbum,2022-08-13T20:27:50,1
">If Puerto Rico declared independence from the US, we would not let that stand, however credible or laughable the claim.  Uh.   There have been multiple legal referendums about Puerto Rican independence.   Like there's an explicit law that states if Puerto Rico wants to cease being a part of the United States, that's perfectly fine. The USA wouldn't send the Marines over it. I'm not sure why these asinine comparisons keep being brought up in conversations about Taiwan - there's quite literally no analogy to the PRC's obsession over an island nation it has never actually administered in any sense. We don't need to go searching of one.   >Their military would put up a good fight, but nothing short of a miracle would save them.   The PRC could demonstrate all the capability of Russia in Ukraine and still be assured of victory.  That is really, really, really far from a certainty.

"China already has easy access to the Philippine Sea and the Pacific Ocean. They sail through the Bashi Channel and Luzon Strait literally all the time. Furthermore it's actually quite difficult to ""lock"" the South China Sea (whatever you mean by that) when China has military bases in the middle of it. And, finally, the only reason any access would be cut off in the first place is if China is at war with one of the countries near its eastern coast. China isn't at war. Therefore, it does not need Taiwan for anything.   The notions of 'access' have always been completely overstated.

That’s an incredibly racist and ethnonationalist thing to say. Taiwan’s population does not mostly identify as Chinese and most lived there before the PRC OR ROC was founded - how could they be part of the Chinese nation?

"It's not certain, no, but Russia invading Ukraine was thought to be a bad idea for Russia even when we thought they would roll over the Ukrainian military.

That isn’t true at all. An invasion of Taiwan would be several magnitudes harder than that of Ukraine - and China has less experience in actually waging war or suppressing air defenses than Russia does. China would have to perform better than Russia early on and Taiwan would have to perform worse than Ukraine. There is very little evidence the PLA is actually ready to invade Taiwan.,dunpyklungo,2022-08-23T06:22:16,1

The only reason that would be necessary is if China decides to invade Japan or Taiwan. China isn’t at war with either right now, so it sails through the Bashi Channel just fine.
