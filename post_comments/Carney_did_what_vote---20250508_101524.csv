He handled Trump expertly so as not to offend anyone but at the same time making it clear Canada will never be the 51st state and compared it to how just like real estate some things are not for sale so the child in the room had a way of understanding. Most of us in Canada are so sick of the talk about becoming the 51st state we want it to stop and reporters to stop asking about it. I think at this point should just refuse to even answer the question any more.,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-08T10:22:50,93

Is being an adult the bar now?,ExecutiveCactus,2025-05-09T07:24:43,1
We were very very close to having Temu Trump in Pierre Poilievre. Scary close until Carney was chosen as leader. I was beyond relieved on Election Day.,Strange_Depth_5732,2025-05-08T23:45:23,8
Then remove the child and put an adult in. Itâ€™s irresponsible to just wait for him to tire himself out.,readonlyy,2025-05-08T12:17:19,10
"Thank you. And I agree entirely. Thanks to *Canadian* right-wing media peopleâ€™s opinion of Trudeauâ€™s three terms is highly skewed. Sure, weâ€™ve had better PMs. But weâ€™ve most certainly had worse.",sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T10:57:51,50
"Trudeau could have behaved the same way, Trump would not have taken it as well.",JoeDwarf,2025-05-08T10:51:05,24
Nah Trump hates Trudeau.   Probably one of the reasons is the rumors Melania has the hots for him. ðŸ˜‚,aacilegna,2025-05-08T13:57:29,6
"As a liberal voter, Iâ€™m personally glad Trudeau stepped down because I was legitimately undecided until then.  Trudeau did great work during his first term but itâ€™s really really hard to defend his last few years.  Having a new leader and from a more economic background is what the party needed so Iâ€™m glad he stepped down and let someone else take the lead for the liberal party.",McMatey_Pirate,2025-05-08T15:04:52,8
"He doesnt have the background and also burned his reputation in Canada by going back on voter reform. Trump has already called him Govenor, etc. Trump is way more afraid of Carney and it shows.   Could he have? Maybe.",Vanilla_Either,2025-05-08T10:25:03,9

"first, he needs to explain to Trump on what a tariff actually is but at a 1st grade level that way there's at least some hope he'd understand.",grandblue-91,2025-05-08T11:32:53,4
"Yeah, he's been around powerful people in several countries, he could have info",Strange_Depth_5732,2025-05-08T23:48:37,2
It was a narrow margin but Iâ€™m glad too. he. He shows real leadership and is so incredibly good at deflating journalist vultures.,redditknees,2025-05-09T06:46:37,2
"Our Temu Trump (Dutton) also got nearly elected. However, Labor won in a landslide. Labor is the incumbent government and elections almost always favour the opposition. Meanwhile, Labor managed to improve their figures compared to the previous election. Like Poilievre, Dutton also lost his own seat although he gracefully bowed out of politics instead of coercing an MP in a safe seat to resign so he could take their place in a by-election.",thisisdropd,2025-05-09T02:07:47,5
And how do you propose that be done?,blockhose,2025-05-08T13:01:34,5
>Trudeau could have behaved the same way  And would have. Remember who his father was and how he was raised.,sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T10:59:01,14
"True, he didn't like that Trudeau was charismatic. Carney is steady and delightfully bland, so Trump doesn't feel threatened. Carney is just here to do his job, not carve a legacy and Trump doesn't know what to do with that.",Strange_Depth_5732,2025-05-08T23:47:03,2
"Even worse, cameras caught Ivanka staring at Trudeau with visible lust",NickelBackwash,2025-05-08T19:45:48,5
I get that. I just never got the Canadian Trudeau hate. Mainly because it seems to me he was attacked for being a politician and his only like Superbad scandal was the blackface. That was just me as an AmericanÂ ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-08T15:16:09,6

>and also burned his reputation in Canada by going back on voter reform  also just fatigue. He ran on electoral reform in 2015 and that didn't prevent him from winning two more FPTP elections in 2019 and 2021,rookie-mistake,2025-05-08T15:08:01,4
"Good point, Trump would have pushed and pushed until something happened",Strange_Depth_5732,2025-05-08T23:47:56,1
My favorite new joke- what's the difference between a filthy toilet and Pierre Poilievre? Both are full of shit but the toilet has a seat.,Strange_Depth_5732,2025-05-09T10:22:01,1
You mean its not easy to get rid of the leader of the most powerful military which has the best intelligence network... who is also backed by the richest person in the world?! /s,bwurtsb,2025-05-08T13:44:28,8
"Trudeau and Freeland got the better of Trump last time around and he remembers it, which is why he'd just throw a tantrum if he had to deal with either of them again.",JoeDwarf,2025-05-08T11:00:59,25
"Iâ€™d agree.  Itâ€™s something thatâ€™s always really turned me off from engaging with people about politics because it always seems to eventually become an attack on the person (which by the way, having met Trudeau, super nice guy and very friendly) versus their position and politics (as well as the impact our elected MPs both conservative and liberal have).",McMatey_Pirate,2025-05-08T16:03:29,5
"lol, so tired of seeing people say things like ""america please get rid of him""  Yeah we fucking wish",Mammoth_Procedure_11,2025-05-08T17:29:39,7
Precisely. IMO itâ€™s too bad that it would be politically difficult for PM Carney to offer Freeland a major cabinet position.,sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T11:38:26,3
