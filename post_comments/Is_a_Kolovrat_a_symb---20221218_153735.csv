"Nazis are a bit like cockroaches.   If you see one, there are a dozen in hiding.  If you see one in a group, and said group doesnt work hard to force out said Nazi, that group now has the unfortunate distinction of being Nazi-friendly.   Now you can't stop Nazis liking certain things, whether its Punk music, Metal, methamphetamines, Slavic imagery, etc, you can get groups of fans of these examples that do not tolerate Nazis at all, and then you can also get groups that do",brinz1,2022-12-19T04:32:38,21
"Sometimes. With symbols you often need to look at the context to decide meaning.  The Kolovrat is a made up pagan symbol (doesn’t appear before the 20th century) that’s recently gained popularity among neo-pagans and neo-fascists, especially in Eastern Europe and Russia.",pluralofjackinthebox,2022-12-19T05:29:19,11
"Yes-ish.   For context I'm pagan. I'm not Asatru but they're a large part of the community.  The symbol itself independent of other associations can indicate a kind of nebulous flavor of Slavic design and it does show up somewhat more in design motifs associated with pagans. As far as I'm aware, the symbols doesn't have a historical root but the word ""kolovrat"" itself is, from what I understand, basically the Russian version of ""swastika.""   There are segments of the racist/neo-nazi/white supremacist community that follow bastardized versions of what they view as historic folk religions and they can use some of these symbols, the sun wheel is probably among them though it doesn't tie *specifically* to them.  It should prompt a closer examination but in and of itself it shouldn't be taken as a symbol of racism and white supremacy.",HeloRising,2022-12-19T06:03:14,4

"I have a question. What does it mean to you when you say you are a pagan? My understanding is that pre christianity no one at that time referred themselves as pagan. When Christianity started gaining greater support in the urban areas the word was dismissively used as country bumpkins who still believed in the old gods. Prior to just recently the definition was understood to mean those people who believed in polytheism. Now we have arrived at neo-paganism. It certainly isn't atheism. Does it mean multiple spirits? Does it incorporate an afterlife? Is there a concept like heaven or hell? Do your actions in this life reflect the outcome in the next? Is it more animism is belief or are the 'gods"" more anthropomorphic in conception. Do you pray to them for protection or to intervene in certain outcomes? I understand it is closely tied to nature based philosophy. If so what things do you do to embrace paganism. I am not religious so this just seems like a return to polytheism but not necessarily any specific one. Thanks",Head-like-a-carp,2022-12-19T15:39:07,1

"Speaking as a neo-pagan, wearing Norse or Celtic imagery means nothing re: Nazis by itself. Nazis do like to take our symbols for themselves sometimes for racist reasons, but without further indication, you can't know if this person is one of them, or one of the majority of Norse pagans who are anti-Nazi and have no truck with bigots.  Edit: tbh, with that haircut and that jewelry in his ear and on both wrists, I'd definitely guess it's the latter.",theRuathan,2022-12-19T07:57:06,13
"Pagan is more, as /u/theRuathan indicated, a group term more than a specific one.  It speaks to a collection of different beliefs that are grouped together out of a mishmash of linguistics and culture.  It's not 100% accurate but it's much faster and easier to just say ""pagan"" than it is to try to drill down to specifics, especially in an exchange where that's not really the point. Similar to how if you were a Baptist or a Nestorian, you'd probably be willing to identify as ""Christian"" unless the conversation were about *your* beliefs specifically.  Neo-paganism is a little more specific in the sense that it tends to focus on reconstructions of historical belief systems or on belief systems constituted closer to contemporary times. For instance, Wicca is a distillation of a wide variety of pre-Christian (primarily European) concepts but wasn't really formally introduced until the 1950's. There's other traditions that are more reconstructionist like Kemeticism (Egyptian), Hellenic (Greek), Asatru (Norse/Scandinavian-ish) etc that are *technically* neo-pagan in the sense that a lot of them have been rebuilt off of existing information but they're not continuous belief systems for a variety of reasons.  There's a little bit of discomfort with the ""neo-pagan"" label within the community in the sense that it makes it seem kind of like a fad or a trend and detracts from the seriousness of people's beliefs but that's not universal.  It's impossible to talk about ""paganism"" in generalities because you have to drill down to more specifics of what this or that person's particular path talks about.  For instance, I'm a Hellenic pagan. I do believe the Olympians are real in the sense that they exist and I could (were they willing to allow it) touch them. There is some variation within the Hellenic community about the specifics but that's *broadly* true of most of us. We do pray to the gods and ask for things but it's more about establishing a relationship of reciprocity.  Within Hellenism you have the concept of ""*xenia*"" which is essentially a relationship built upon mutual reciprocity. We build relationships with the gods by offering things to them (prayers, offerings, devotions, etc) and in return we can ask (key word being *ask*) for certain things. It sounds transactional but it's more instructive to think of it the way you have a relationship with a close friend - you do things for each other not because you want to get something in return but more because they're your friend and you trust that they'll have your back if you need something.   That act is *""kharis.*"" It's hard to translate well but it basically means giving to be supportive rather than out of an expectation of a reward - you give because you wish to give rather than to receive.  There's not a hardened concept of heaven or hell in the Hellenic view. Hades/Tartarus is close-ish but it's more just a place that kinda sucks, kinda like Limbo in the sense that you're not *tortured* but it also just isn't fun. The river Styx (also the Acheron) leads into and through the Underworld, those who die must pay the boatman, Charon, for passage. It's not altogether clear how this process works exactly, the Underworld isn't a place for mortals (with a few heroic exceptions.)  An interesting aside is the pagan relationship with ""I don't know."" I think we've kind of conditioned ourselves through constant exposure to the big monotheist religions to expect that there's an answer to every question we have and that that answer makes sense to us. Pagans, on the other hand, tend to be more comfortable with a certain degree of ambiguity.  We don't know how these things work, we believe that they do, and we have no grand *need* that these things be justified to our satisfaction. We know what we know and what the gods allow us to know, why should they feel compelled to throw open the gates and give guided tours? It would be nice, to be sure, but pagan belief is generally not contingent upon having an exact blueprint of where all the bathrooms are in the afterlife.",HeloRising,2022-12-20T02:02:03,2
"Paganism is an umbrella term. Pagans, as you put it so succinctly, believe in the old gods - the native gods and religions of Europe, so to speak.   The term neo-pagan is used to distinguish between the original practitioners, most of whose practices have been lost, and modern practitioners who often have recreated what they could with the use of history and anthropology, and filled in the gaps with things that work for today's world.  The answers to pretty much all your questions will depend on the person you're asking. Paganism tends to be more focused on fostering good/healthy/right relationships vs orthodoxy or orthopraxy, so any answers you get will not be applicable to all modern pagans.",theRuathan,2022-12-19T23:40:54,1
"Woke is where people were stealing things from Christianity.  Awake is a major concept in the Bible, with very particular associations.  (Ezekiel 12:2)(Proverbs 20:12)(Isaiah 42:7)(Matthew 13:15-17)  Like in the Book of Revelations, do have ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the Churches?  Someone who did may be ""Awake.""  Someone who was woke was most assuredly deaf to God, and possibly working on cursing himself, and his posterity as a mocker.",ManonFire63,2022-12-19T06:14:42,-5

"Ah yes, evil has never used the same minorities they decry as tokens to hold plausible deniability of their intentions.  Also, white supremacists view different Latino descent differently. Basically ""white"" is an arbitrary term that is used whenever those in power need to feel victimized or empowered. Look up how the Boers in apartheid South Africa deemed Chinese as non-white but Japanes, Taiwanese, and Korean as ""white""  It's the ""in-group"" necessary for right wing fascism.  Stop buying into their cover and being part of the problem.  Also how there were Jewish Nazis.  Grow up and stop being purposefully obtuse.
