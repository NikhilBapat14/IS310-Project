"What is sad is that the DNC still has a chance to lose the 2026 elections because the best they can give us is still ""we're not the GOP"" instead of making significant improvements at the state and possibly local level.  Regardless of Trump's actions, the price gouging for basic necessities is still a real issue. The DNC could really score a big win here but.. I Just don't see any DNC rep really trying. Just hoping Trump's failures brings them to victory.  We're fucked.",Naticbee,2025-04-27T11:24:17,11

"Even when it is blatantly obvious that the R's are lying and cheating, and intentionally harming most people, the D's continue to play by Hoyle's Rules.  If this were a game with proper umpires, the R's would have been thrown out and forfeited the entire game, by now.",Natoochtoniket,2025-04-27T11:37:34,5
"Of course the DNC could do plenty, but they won't, they never do. That's why we got into this situation to begin with. The Democratic party loves to sit on their asses doing next to nothing at any given time, even when they do have one or more branches of government under their control they only do a fraction of what they could do. If they did even half of what they could do, the Democrats would win every election local to federal with ease and pass laws and amendments specifically to stop what Trump is doing right at this moment long before Trump was ever a thing.  This is because by sitting back and letting the Republicans screw up the country, the Democratic party can swoop back in and grab the reins to power without having to do much of anything to actually help the country other than try to clean up after the Republicans. Which means the Republican party has been running rampant over the country almost completely unopposed chipping away at our rights and freedoms for decades while the Democratic party did next to nothing to actually stop them. What we're seeing now is the result of decades of the Democrats sitting back and letting the Republicans do whatever they want with little to no resistance, and now the Republicans got Trump and don't have to even make the tiniest pretense anymore that they want anything other than money and power.",immortalfrieza2,2025-04-27T13:33:54,1
