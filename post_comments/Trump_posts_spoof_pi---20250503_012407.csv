"Honestly, I don’t think anything. Everyone is burnt out. Social media has destroyed our brains and desensitized us to the world. I really think that everyone has just given up hope and people are tired. The world just fucking sucks and everyone knows it.",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-05-03T17:19:05,2
"Americans are in a beautiful catch 22 moment.   Trump is waiting for the smallest excuse to invoke the insurrection act and purge everything as fast as he can (his shock and awe strategy). So anyone taking the lead will expose themselves to direct retribution and accelerate the authoritarianist takeover.   But whether Americans move or not he will do it regardless to get rid of any dissenting voice. It may not be called the insurrection act, but the result will still be some kind of purge.   I'm not an American and don't live there, but the only possible option I see and I hope for is that the blue states are organizing backstage to declare some kind of coordinated separation from the federal government. That would mean getting some key generals within the national guard and other military bases onboard with this to force the confrontation. I do not see any peaceful way out of this. Even if Trump dies tomorrow, the heritage foundation and all the enablers will still be there, ready to handover the key of a new authoritarian state to whoever wants it.  I believe all the media pushing forward Gavin Newsom for the next election and explaining that the midterm will allow for a shift in power are, at best naive and quite possibly, complicit with the current takeover. They push for apathy because citizen have no reason to fight back ICE if it will be peacefully resolved with a vote. Which it will not. Trump did not allow for a peaceful transition of power the last time. There is absolutely no reason to think he would this time around, and he has accumulated far more power than last time.",Shallowmoustache,2025-05-03T20:04:31,1

"Nah. The shame is working. I tried that strategy a lot. I figured it was worth trying the opposite. They know it's dumb.  The key is to never engage in debate. Just send the things and let them sort through it. Without any further engagement from me, they have to sit with the shit or block me. Political onslaught negging/denial? I think it's doing well, but my sample size is like 80 people (and obviously shrinking) but I've seen cracks from this approach where I haven't before.  Edit: to clarify, I also only use Trump's official platforms so there can't be media spin they can hide under.",custardthegopher,2025-05-03T02:34:33,12
