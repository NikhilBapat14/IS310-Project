"I know this'll get some hate, but I'm all for it. If people want to leave voluntarily, then I think we should facilitate that. If $1,000 pushes you over the edge to making that decision, then it's money well spent compared to the many thousands of dollars that comes with detaining people and compelling them to leave. I doubt it'll get that many takers, it costs far more than this to be smuggled into the country, but each one is a financial win. I just don't feel the need to waste thousands of my tax paper dollars to punish someone who came looking for a better life, albeit in the wrong way, if we don't have to. As with people deported through compulsion though, if you take the money you should be put in the same registry that leads to punishment if you reenter the country illegally",ElderberryMental101,2025-05-10T10:38:02,61
"I get it is supposedly cheaper this way, but I still don't like it. I would have preferred we made it untenable to stay here illegally in a lasting way by enforcing laws.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T10:19:42,21
It costs more to deport people involuntarily,Running_Gamer,2025-05-10T11:34:47,9
"I don't mind this. The whole reason for them to come here is to make money and live a better life. These people need help, but they can't flood the US. Send them home with a little bit of cash and hopefully we can work with the governments to eliminate the cartels.",theboss2461,2025-05-10T10:29:34,12
Yeah im for this. It's a small amount of money considering how much deportation the correct way would cost.,cathbadh,2025-05-10T17:24:34,2
"It should be 5 times higher. The avg. cost to our gov. to deport an alien is about 18k. Give them 5k to establish themselves back in their home countries and be done with it. That could buy them something substantial like a plot of land or the means to start a business back home. It’s effective and cheap.  Edit: To the conservatives downvoting this - you are fools. You’d rather double or triple the deportation costs and timespans just so you can take the hardline of “we’re not paying them.” Get fucking real, there are MILLIONS. We need to prioritize any safe method that expedites the deportations, let alone makes it fucking cheaper!! “I ain’t paying no immigrants” well OK, they’ll be your neighbors and have your jobs forever then!! Maddening.",Long_Strawberry9523,2025-05-10T11:30:07,7
Pay them as long as they sign away their rights to ever return home . It’s a one time payment buddy can’t do this over and over. If they refuse to sign away their rights no bonus and they’re subject to the regular deportation process.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-10T10:39:54,3

Ok with since it's much be easier and cheaper than catching and processing people.   What a sea change! Not long ago they had an app to help them get in. Now an app to leave,Key-Monk6159,2025-05-10T16:46:47,0
"Has this worked at all? Every time they try to pin someone down to say ""how many have taken the offer"" they don't have numbers. Is it enough money?  If this works great! If not, we need to come up with a fast docket system. Obama was able to deport 3 million people in 4 years (truth? I see 3 and 6, depending) - we can just do so humanely, without his cages.",lady__jane,2025-05-10T17:50:36,0
"This is US potentially feeding 20 billion dollars plus into the economy of foreign nations when at least the cost of removal by law feeds those funds back into our own economy. People shouldn't be rewarded for breaking the law. The majority of people in the US support stricter immigration laws, it's time the government started acting on our behalf in enforcing our laws strictly instead of employing gimmicks like this.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T11:09:35,16
"Enforcing the law, rather than paying people for breaking it; is worth the cost IMO.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:08:24,2
Something tells me that money will go straight into the cartels operating in their home countries once these people get home. They'll be waiting for them at the airport.,According-Activity87,2025-05-10T11:12:05,-1
"I was thinking that too. $5k would be an incentive - $1k, not so much.",lady__jane,2025-05-10T17:54:33,4

Maddening.  You know one of the big reasons our country isn't like the ones these people are running away from... Because we as a people valued the law and were willing to sacrifice/pay for it. The countries these people run from are full of those looking for the easy way out rather than doing what is right, and often difficult. That's the true cost of being a civilized nation, not compromising morals to do what is easy, but rather doing what is right; even when it's hard.  Remembering this as a nation is what's going to ""Make America Great Again""; not quick and easy gimmicks to get US out of a bind.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:36:08,3
"Deputize me then offer me $5000 a head and I'll get them out of the country my damn self, no questions asked. Then I'll spend most of the money here in the US.  Why should foreigners who've violated our laws be provided something law abiding US citizens don't get (fresh start funds).",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:12:23,1
"I also disagree with rewarding the bad behavior, but it is kind of the wrong way to look at it. 1 time cost vs ongoing costs. Just because the ongoing cost goes back into our economy doesn't mean it isn't a waste of money.",RatRabbi,2025-05-10T12:51:50,8
does not matter. really. but yeah no travel documents and land in your own country or another is likely  gonna mean some bribes paid to get out of the airport.,SerendipitySue,2025-05-10T13:47:12,1
"Sounds like a great idea theoretically. But you’d need tens of thousands of people (not LE trained or sanctioned) hunting millions of immigrants who would have to be armed for their own safety, surely no major incidents could spiral out of control, right?  You can take the stance of “why should they get the money?” Hell, I don’t think they fucking should either, but this is our bed and we’re laying in it. It’s not a mystery that it costs about $18,000 to deport them. Someone would rather make it 3x more expensive to the tax payer and 3x longer of a process to unburden our nation, out of nothing but spite? Would a wise man prioritize the intended outcome, or a harder and pricier process based in spite of others?",Long_Strawberry9523,2025-05-10T13:27:53,3
"There are lots of ways to look at it, but ""wrong""; nah. I just don't believe it's good policy for any government to reward people for breaking the law, which this policy effectively does. As far as fiscal considerations, I'd rather the money stay in the US, even if we spend more to get it done (I wouldn't call proper law enforcement a ""waste of money""). This policy rewards criminals and ships money out of the country, I'm against both of those things.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:04:45,1
"Doing things the wrong way, simply because it's easier never ends well in the long run.   This is a horrible precedence to set. All someone has to do now is jump the border to claim a ticket home and a wad of cash.   Enforce our laws and reformed them if it isn't efficient. Do it the right way, don't reward people for violating our laws.",According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:42:12,1
"i look at it like this, these people are going to be deported. This is a much cheaper process for deportation.  It is not rewarding them.   And an easier process. No negotiating with countries to take their people back. Offering a choice of another country if needed.  Clears out the immigration court backlog a little too.",SerendipitySue,2025-05-10T13:45:25,1
It's completely rewarding them and I wouldn't be surprised one bit if we didn't see a surge in border encounters once this policy goes live. Might even get the caravans going again. Coyotes who bring them over could even start working it out to take payments of $500 on their inevitable returns. This is a poorly conceived shortcut to a problem that needs real and lasting policy/law reforms to be handled correctly.,According-Activity87,2025-05-10T13:52:20,1
