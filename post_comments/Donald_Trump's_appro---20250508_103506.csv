"You know how the House is passing every Project 2025 bill, voting down investigations, voting down oversight, and generally just doing whatever Trump wants without any resistance?   Yea that is because their constituents want it. Sure, they might ""disapprove"" of Trump - whatever that means - but they are still 100% behind Congress giving up their power to Trump and acting as an extension of him. They are on the whole supportive of all the shit going on. They love it. They still see it as hurting the libs. They don't care if the price of eggs hasn't changed, they don't are that the price of gas is going up, they don't care that their relatives and friends are being deported. They don't care how much Trump lies. They don't care that our national parks are being sold off to the highest bidder. They don't give a shit about all the warning signs of a recession coming, they are all in on it.   They'll vote (R) again in a heartbeat. Republican House reps know it. Republican Senators know it. Trump knows it. He's not going anywhere. They aren't going anywhere. Conservatives are perfectly fine with turning the United States into Trump's authoritative hellhole even if they ""disapprove"".

It's so hard to have any sympathy for them. It's the only way forward though. I'm currently struggling with having any forgiveness for the people in my family who were excited for years by Trump. Allowing people to change and not making them pay for it forever is the right thing to do. Just hard. For me at least.,cockaholic,2025-05-08T13:58:09,25

It sounds like he did the necessary self work to get out of the bubble so for that I am happy for him and hope that they receive love and support from those on the left.

"They have empathy. For people in their towns. For their communities. They can been the kindest people you ever meet. Who’d do anything for you. But they unfortunately have a hard time expanding that empathy to people they’ll never know or never meet. They’ve been told the scary “others” are coming to hurt them and their loved ones.   I’m not excusing it. I wish they had seen the light sooner, I wish we weren’t in this mess. But we have to understand that a good chunk of MAGA are just scared ignorant people who can come around. I just hope it will happen before we hit a point of no return.   And some of them can be really strong allies after they do. The family member of mine with the gay kid? She struggled at first, when her daughter came out, but now she’s a staunch supporter of the LGBT. She’s marched at pride, she argues with friends and family defending not just gay people, but trans and non binary people too.

I know it's difficult, but it's not only really not worth it: and you will also probably get under your MAGA bosses skin even more by not taking the bait.  These people live and die by ""owning the libs"", after all. He doesn't care if he's ignorant, he doesn't care if he's wrong, he doesn't care about the damage this does to the office environment or even the country.

"Your boss kinda sounds pathetic.   Poking fun at people in a respectful way is one thing, but that honestly makes him sound like he’s a petty, disrespectful, unprofessional type of person. In other words, he’s about as shitty of a boss as you can get, personality-wise, anyhow.   From that description, you make it sound like this guy has the emotional maturity and social skills of a teenage boy. Like fr, how old is this guy, like 14?   That would mostly track for these MAGA types, but still.

"That’s a beautiful sentiment. I couldn’t agree more.   It’s hard to see that slim hope sometimes but I think that way of seeing it really is the key to doing something about it.   There is so much that is out of our control, but I think one thing we can and should be careful to control and monitor is how we let these realities impact our perception of these people. They may have a hard time expanding that empathy network on their own, but that’s why people like that need people like us who know how to do that and have the tools they lack. It’s just figuring out how to put those tools in their hands and make them actually want to use them that is the tricky part.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-09T00:54:21,2
