I think you can go back and watch full election coverage on youtube from those networks. You will see the time stamp at the bottom of the screen as they announce results.        Here is the final election results [https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/federalelections2020.pdf)  News outlets predicting the winner isn't really supposed to have any sway on the ACTUAL winner. Can I ask the reasoning to want to know this information? Might be able to give you more specific information.,oiledupnik,2024-10-25T12:49:18,1
"Thanks! I'm located in Germany and since I was planning on watching the election coverage, I wanted to ballpark at what time night (or early morning here) I might expect to have a good indication of how the election will sway. I'm not sure I'll stay up until the election is called, so it would be interesting to know at what time some of the east coast battleground states would likely be called.",Katanae,2024-10-25T13:59:42,1
Automod deleted old comment cause I said the S word which has been replaced with the word clown now lol  Hi! I love Germany!!!! <3 Well it's basically political theater here haha. The election will only be called if it's a big electoral college difference OR if one candidate concedes the election. Otherwise it can take several days to verify an election due to some states counting ballots longer or having electronic counting vs hand counting.  I hear in 2000 Fox News MAY have been responsible for kind of peer pressuring people to call an election. (I may be wrong but I remember hearing Fox News called it before the official numbers were released). You need to look more into that don't take my word for it.  2016 I think election wasn't called till like 2am?  2020  was a clown show I cannot even remember because it was so close and there was so much drama even counting the votes.  So the only way 2024 isn't a complete clown show is if it's a landslide for one candidate.  THEN that doesn't even mean the president is elected yet it isn't officially recognized by congress till I think January (6th in 2020 but I cannot remember if that's every year).,oiledupnik,2024-10-25T14:22:26,1
"Thanks again! Yeah I'd say I'm pretty aware of the official process, just not about the media coverage. Here in Germany it is very straight forward: 6pm after polls close you get a quick count and at 8pm a prognosis that usually is not too far off the official results released the following day. Things are of course a bit more complicated in the US for many reasons.",Katanae,2024-10-25T15:55:35,1
