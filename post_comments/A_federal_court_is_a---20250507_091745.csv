Because tariffs are collected by people at ports who apply the schedule.  If they continue to assess those charges outside of law they would be explicitly stealing money from importers.  They won’t do it.    It’s the same thing with tax exempt status on Harvard.  Trump can threaten that the IRS will do something but if the courts say no then Harvard just won’t send the money.

I’m guessing the people who apply the tariffs don’t want legal trouble?  The aspect of the Trump Administration not following the law that isn’t reported well is that they are held accountable. What that almost always means is that someone not named Donald Trump is thrown under the bus. Somehow Trump has convinced a lot of people to break the law in his name. They wind up in court and occasionally go to prison.  Trump can get away with this when he controls the persons long term fate.

I think you are being naively optimistic. They will respond to who they think has the power. That's human nature. That's primates psychology.   Obviously in the end we will have to see empirically what happens. But I would remind you that almost everything that's happened up to this point would have seemed highly unlikely a year ago.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-07T20:51:09,0
"Are ICE agents having mexican standoffs?  Has any court brought charges against an ICE officer?  Have they even been ordered to stop?  Nothing has been done to individuals acting illegally in their roles.  Nothing will be done.

">she is nowhere near being the worst offender in this- Ro Khannon is, and then there's a bunch of other politicians, most of them Republican...  Yeah, MAGAs minimize using whataboutisms a lot too.  Since 2014, the stock market has seen an average increase of around 221 percent, but the value of Pelosi’s portfolio has grown a staggering 818 percent.  She's better than Buffet.  Just coincidence that she invested in tech before major government approval events.    Also, husband ""successful day trader"" total BS.  She should have had 0 support and calls for jail, not excuses.  She's never had a job, yet worth $250M.  >Also, she is nowhere near being the worst offender in this- Ro Khannon is, and then there's a bunch of other politicians, most of them Republican... but the only one we ever hear about is Pelosi.",itsverynicehere,2025-05-07T19:29:26,-5
"Just because she was a level 3 and he's a level 10 doesn't excuse it.  The downvotes and defense of her is exactly like arguing with a MAGA.  Completely irrational.  She should have been run off in shame.  The worst thing about it all is that the MAGA cult learned that it's totally possible to just do things and say ""fuck off"" with no consequences.",itsverynicehere,2025-05-08T16:18:16,1

"Yes, I have but she's the topic and I've chosen to stick to my point.  I refuse to get dragged into whataboutisms and comparisons. What she, and supporters of her did was wrong.  Before Trump she was by far the worst of the worst.  She did better at picking stocks than Warren Buffett.  Totally unapologetic about it and just like now, lots and lots defending her.",itsverynicehere,2025-05-08T16:13:32,1
"If she's better than Warren Buffet, one has to wonder how much better Ro Khanna must be.  Honestly, it's tiresome having to defend Pelosi in these threads. I don't want to. I honestly wish that she would retire, and I think politicians should *not* be able to trade stocks. But when people like you attack Pelosi for insider trading and completely ignore the politicians who are far worse, I really have to wonder what your actual goal is.",RightSideBlind,2025-05-08T16:53:54,1
"Why defend her, that is the entire point. She cheated and stole AND set precedent that those things are ok, plus her ""team"" will defend her because she got powerful and that power was more important.  >But when people like you attack Pelosi for insider trading and completely ignore the politicians who are far worse, I really have to wonder what your actual goal is.  My goal is little more than to remind you that you have allowed this to happen and now that turnabout is fair play, you should really be going after her too.  She can still be shamed and removed, but the seat and the power is too important.  Pelosi abused and sold out Americans to the tune of now having a net worth of over $250M.  As to your question on Ro, total net worth, 1/10th of that, 27M.   He trades a lot, pelosi only trades with inside information, so no need for a lot of ""action"".  He should be kicked too.",itsverynicehere,2025-05-08T20:14:28,1
"It's not really defending her though, is it? It's more that I'm wondering why you've single her out when there are far worse in Congress and the White House.    *I* have not ""allowed"" it to happen. I'm not even sure where you got that from. I've never voted for her, or any other politician who trades on insider information. I think it should be illegal for *every* politician.   You are the one who seems to have tunnel vision here, not me.",RightSideBlind,2025-05-08T23:24:18,1

"Of course what she did was wrong! I never said that it wasn't!  What I said is that she's an amateur next to the ones who are also doing it, and by constantly blaming her for it, you're (intentionally or unintentionally) providing cover for *them*! Worse isn't subjective. These things have dollar values attached to them- that's about as objective as you can get.  Hell, I even pointed out that Ro Khanna is the worst congressional inside trader- guess what ""team"" *he's* on?  I realize you're invested now, that you can't lose face by admitting that you're wrong- but for chrissakes *stop digging when you've hit rock bottom*.",RightSideBlind,2025-05-10T08:37:41,1
"Rock bottom?  You think I care about losing face in a buried thread on an old post?  Are you the main character and people are following this?  Get real. You think you are winning this discussion?    Again, you said you have a defended her, you're part of the problem.  You say you're tired of defending her, not that you regret it .  Not that you acknowledge leaving her in power was a mistake.  That there are ""worse"" is irrelevant to my point.  I know who Mo is and IMO, he's not ""worse"".  First off, she has profited by 10x the amount as Mo   Second, she's worse because she made it OK by ignoring the cries of foul and getting the spin backing from the party and mobilizing masses, the sycophants in forums included.  She set the precedent and lost the high ground, making way for all the shady, entitled pieces of shit that follow. You played your role in it and are defending her just like MAGA's do their dear leader.  I can tell you are spent.  Good-ish talk, have a good weekend.",itsverynicehere,2025-05-10T09:15:15,1
"Yeah, I think you *do* care- because otherwise you wouldn't keep coming back to this thread, insisting that you're right, even though we are in agreement that insider trading shouldn't be legal for any politicians.  And now you're going to strut off, still insisting that you won some sort of worthless internet points that only you seem to really care about.",RightSideBlind,2025-05-10T10:52:05,1
