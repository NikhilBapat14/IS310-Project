"From a logistical standpoint, there are a couple things that stick out.  The biggest for me is that by winning this time, Trump will be able to replace several Supreme Court justices--Alito, Thomas, and possibly Roberts. He will likely replace them with very young people, which ensure that the Court would remain conservative-leaning for many decades to come. The first time Trump was elected, the implications for the Court were bad, but they were fixable within the next decade or so. At this point, Trump's election basically ensures that liberal legislation will be struck down by the courts for the rest of my life. Even if the Democrats find a way to win back Congress and pass legislation, the Supreme Court won't uphold most of it.  Second, there's a lot less Republican resistance to Trump this time around. Last time, Paul Ryan controlled the House, and the Senate Republican coalition was very anti-Trump. This ensured that they wouldn't even bring up a lot of the stuff that Trump wanted to do for a vote in the House or Senate. This time, the coalitions are a lot friendlier to his priorities, and he has more control over them. He also appointed a *lot* of judges to the lower-level courts during his first presidency, which means a lot less friction for his legislative goals in general.  Third, in 2016 a lot of people convinced themselves that Trump's presidency was a fluke. We didn't know what his presidency looked like, and he didn't win the popular vote, so it was easy for people to believe that this wasn't the will of the voters. This time it clearly is, even though they know exactly what a Trump presidency will look like. That's hard for a lot of people to accept.  However ... I guess I don't really agree with the premise that people are going more bananas over this election than 2016. At least among people I know, they were *much* more shocked and upset in 2016. The reaction this year is pretty muted compared to how bad it was then.",anneoftheisland,2024-11-12T13:32:58,145
"Like others here have said, in 2016 he didn't have control of the GOP. In 2024, it's undoubtedly his party and there will likely be zero resistance. By the time he made the GOP his own, they had already lost the house in 2018.",Chunk_Cheese,2024-11-12T15:18:29,22
"Do you perhaps live in a place with a parliamentary system?  The President has a lot of power in the US and party loyalties are very strong right now. In 2016, Trump campaigned as a demogogue, but people didn't really know how he would govern. He didn't know either, which is why he staffed his administration with a lot of experienced, mainstream Republicans.  Since then, the party has been purged of almost all its traditionalists. They've all been driven out, either reputationally or electorally. The biggest symbol of this shift is the change from Mike Pence to JD Vance as the Vice President, but there are many others as well. Trump's daughter in-law is co-chair of the party now. Anyone who might serve as a check on his authoritarian instincts is gone and won't be coming back.  Simultaneously, Trump knows how to work the levers of power much better now. In 2016, he had never even held elected office. Now, he's been President for four years and has been shoring up his political support since then. He'll be much more capable of enacting his agenda.  And for the opposition, his agenda is scary. In his first term, he appointed Supreme Court justices (they serve for life) who not only overturned rights people feel are fundamental, but also ruled that the President has much broader immunity than most people previously thought he had, giving Trump carte blanche to push the boundaries of what we traditionally found acceptable. His loyalty-tested majorities in both houses of Congress won't stop him.  He has also promised to take significantly more severe actions this time around. He's repeatedly made physical threats against his political opponents, which he didn't do in 2016. And when he was running then, he talked about securing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but this time, he's talking about deporting *all* of them in massive waves that could be very disruptive. His proposed tariff regime is also much more broad than anything he proposed in his first administration.  These are just a few things that make this time potentially different, but in truth, we don't quite know how he's going to govern, because he has a history of saying he's going to do stuff that he never does.",nosecohn,2024-11-12T18:08:29,10
"A lot of it has to do with the margins. In 2016, yes the Dems lost, but they lost in a rather fluky way. Trump got JUST enough votes to swing key states by the slimmest of margins, and even that only happened because of Comey's fluky investigation into Clinton a week before the election. But this election, Harris lost by a rather convincing margin in literally every swing state. This wasn't a close race that was narrowly lost with an unclear public mandate. This was a direct and clear and notable rejection of the incumbents.  Also, it should be noted that Biden had an objectively VERY good presidency. He accomplished more meaningful legislation than anyone since...LBJ? That's huge. Yes, inflation sucked, but that was also a global phenomenon that swept across every major political system and the US handled that MUCH better than anyone else, plus a lot of that had to directly with actions taken by the administration. Biden will be a president who gets much love from the history books, and so for a lot of Dems they're caught in the despair of ""if we couldn't win with THAT kind of track record, then what even is the point of anything at all?""  Finally, there's a perception that Trump should be a much weaker candidate now than in 2016. In 2016 he was at least somewhat of an unknown quantity and hadn't really governed poorly yet. In 2024, Trump is a convicted felon, a traitor who sold state secrets, someone who incited an insurrection, mishandled the pandemic, had very few if any policy victories, etc. That Trump was so bad and Biden was so good is just adding to the Dem despair right now.  One last note is that I do think there's a bit of overreaction and recency bias going on. There were MANY folks in 2016 who thought this was the end of US democracy and that Trump getting elected was one of the worst things to ever happen to this country. We had a tremendous amount of ""not my president"" and a lot less resignation than we're seeing this time around. (Just to be clear, resignation is not a bad thing--Dems should be still committed to election results even if they are atrocious.) Also, as you pointed out, despite Harris's very poor performance, the Congressional races were much better and Trump will likely have a hard time implementing the more incendiary parts of his agenda without sweeping coattails.",mormagils,2024-11-12T15:22:58,14

"I’m going to touch on the senate because others handled the meat and potatoes of this question. To understand why 53 is much worse than 52, you have to see who comprises the 53 and who made up the 52. You had, in 2016, McCain, Collins, and Murkowski as moderate republicans. McCain in particular managed to save Obamacare, which is a wild turn of events from 2008. The most moderate 50th vote is actually McConnell (assuming the latest Republican senators elected to vacant seats are further right). That’s wild. There are significantly fewer guardrails this time around, and the most likely rail to hold is the chaos of the house preventing action.",kbeks,2024-11-13T06:40:00,2

"It’s different because  1. He won the popular vote solidly. I can’t tell you how big of a symbolic blow this is to democrats and in general culturally. In 2016 after winning the popular vote by over 3 million votes democrats could comfort themselves that a few racist whites in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania bought into Trump’s fake appeal and got manipulated by “Russian Disinformation”. Nothing really needed to change. If anything winning the popular vote by that much meant they could go even more progressive. The party overall the culturally with TV shows and movies and corporations all bought into the idea that democratic ideas and cultural progressivism were the dominant themes of the country and that we were inevitably going down this road. Losing the popular vote and each swing state by a decently convincing margin is a shock to the party and to the culture overall. You will see the cultural impact almost immediately in terms of far less companies and movies and tv shows etc promoting anything perceived as “woke” and that progressive activist language and power will be greatly marginalized whereas many institutions And the Democratic Party as a whole largely cowered at the demands of progressive activists from 2016-2024.   2. A massive demographic realignment has occurred. The signs of these things were already present in 2016 (when Trump crushed among the white working class) and 2020 (when Trump crushed among the white working class and made some noticeable inroads with black and Latino voters).   Despite all his faults Trump still grew the working class realignments in 2020 but lost the suburbs which allowed Biden to narrowly win by 43K votes across 3 swing states. Trump allies (probably correctly) believe they would’ve easily won in 2020 if only they had embraced mail in voting and early voting with some semblance of a get out the vote effort.   Now from 2020 to 2024 the Democratic theory of the case was that trumps favorability and electability were nullified post January 6th. A majority of the country would never support him again. This plus massive lawsuits that largely drained his campaign funding would have ensured a failed campaign they believed.   Between the civil, state, and federal multiple criminal trials there was an OVERWHELMING cash advantage for democrats. They never imagined that 1. Trump could avoid trial on his most serious charges. And 2. Be able to still win the popular vote and electoral college in a landslide despite January 6th And all the expected woman backlash to abortion. Despite an environment that was unfavorable to incumbents there was an overwhelming confidence among the democrats that they succeeded in crushing his finances and portraying him as a disqualified candidate.   All of the above is what makes trumps victory a catastrophic disaster for democrats. They know it deep down if not for abortion, Jan 6, and the cash advantage it would be a 1980 style 40 state blowout and a 7-8 point national vote rout. And the fact that for 3 straight cycles the working class realignment has just gotten worse and worse means they can’t hope Trump being unpopular will save them from President elect JD Vance in 2028. If Hispanics continue drifting away or even voting for the GOP at the current level democrats will be the permanent minority party barring another extremely unlikely realignment. This is the first realignment since Regan. I heard on a democrat friendly podcast that if just the white working class ever start supporting the GOP at the same rates blacks support the democrats, the democrats would never win again. We may starting down that road. Harris still won around 33% of the white working class and that just seems like it’s going to go down down. I don’t know how the democrats fix their working class problem and win in 2028 when the GOP will likely keep their working class margins roughly the same or even better while running a candidate more appealing to the suburbs. And that election likely won’t have the threat of a national abortion ban (assuming Trump actually leaves it up to the states which I believe is extremely likely). There is also the minor issue of the fact that young people (both men and women) are not becoming more liberal. In fact both young men and young women voted for Trump at higher rates than in 2020 according to exit polls. If the trends continue gen Z might become far more right wing that anyone could’ve expected, but it’s still too early to see if this is a trend or not.",vsv2021,2024-11-12T19:44:46,3

"I agree except the part about people not losing it more than last time.  I agree it was extremely shocking the first time, so maybe it’s similar.  I think part of why it’s so bad now is we know the next 4 years are going to be a as constant stream of bad news, with the potential outcome of the republicans fixing elections to remain in power forever.  I can very easily see how the US morphs into Russia in the near future, whereas the “checks and balances” before his first term gave us hope that democracy would survive.  Another aspect is that he won the popular vote this time, so > 50% of the people who voted for him basically said “I’m fine with fascism as long as I can save a few bucks on eggs and a tank of gas”.  It really speaks to how ignorant so many people in this country are and have officially joined a cult.  If I didn’t have an aging parent still alive in the US I would be seriously considering moving to a country where I have a better than average chance of being allowed in.

"So remember that there are checks and balances.   The Supreme Court's job is to interpret laws. The problem is that many laws are vague or simply not spelled out. For example, abortion. There is nothing in our Constitution or federal laws that enshrine the rights of abortion. Same with interracial or gay marriage. The courts interpreted that the laws banning these marriages violated rights guaranteed in the Constitution.   With abortion, they found another way to interpret the laws. However, the court cannot make laws. Now when they interpret laws, that becomes the law of the land so to speak, but they do not make laws. Congress could override a Supreme Court ruling by passing a law that invalidates their ruling. How does it invalidate the ruling? Well because the law is different now. Their ruling was based on the interpretation of laws at that point in time. If laws are passed that fill in that interpretation hole, then we are fine.    Now a potential issue could be if the courts determine that a law passed violates the Constitution. And that is a real threat. However, the courts can't just willy billy decide to invalidate a law. It has to be brought to the court.   Now I am not saying that Trump stacking SCOTUS isn't scary. It is. If we get a bunch of far right people and continue to have an ineffective Congress then they can do a lot of damage. For example, the Dobbs decision could be invalidated if we passed a law guaranteeing abortion rights. However, I don't see this Congress doing it. Unless we (Democrats) get a super majority, it won't happen sadly.   But I also want to be sure that we don't give up hope. Yes things like dire now. But we need to keep fighting.",JayNotAtAll,2024-11-12T16:00:49,7
