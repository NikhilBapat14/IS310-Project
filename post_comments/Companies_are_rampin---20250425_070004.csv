Our chicken shit leader will blink further yet. The biggest issue Trump is causing is not offering clear decisions and sticking with them.,Big-Plankton-4484,2025-04-25T07:04:35,6
"Trump stated XI called him. But, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told reporters on Thursday China and the U.S. are not having consultations or negotiations on tariffs.   One of the leaders of these two countries is known for many untruths.",OrbeaSeven,2025-04-25T07:26:27,7
"If it’s even a possibility, it will take DECADES to unfuck the situation this absolute fucking jackass has inflicted upon us and we’re still less than 100 days into his term.",Germs_Dean,2025-04-25T07:26:25,3
"With so many of his advisors being methheads and druggies, you'd think at least one would know to never fuck with your suppliers.",theassassintherapist,2025-04-25T07:36:39,4
Nut up and directly blame Trump and his administration. A lot of these big box bastards betrayed the general populace to min/max their profits only to see their revenue cut.,AgentDutch,2025-04-25T07:10:20,3
And yet they poured money into his campaign and kiss the ring when required.,CharacterAssistant85,2025-04-25T07:23:19,3
"Whenever I hear another trump supporter claim they didn't know they'd be paying tariffs, I'm infuriated. Maybe they should finally question their news sources.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-25T09:42:49,2
Lots of companies use algorithms to buy goods from overseas supplies to cover their thin margins and price uncertainty from tariffs makes it hard for them to make even a slim profit at a price consumers will purchase at. Without sales volume they will be laying off folks and closing stores.  In poorer or rural areas it will be hard to find the basic necessities eventually.,geekstone,2025-04-25T09:43:10,1
Its like they shouldn't have donated so much...,haroldthehampster,2025-04-25T10:51:07,1
Is that really the biggest issue he is causing?,ak4733,2025-04-25T07:15:02,2
"Tbf the major donor class thought he was just kidding about massive tariffs. All the devastated sectors would be theirs.  Then at about SuperBowl time, they openly scoffed at tariffs saying the program would be a failure.  They aren’t openly scoffing anymore but the admin is realizing it’s not that fast n’easy at all.   Think reality is starting to set in that there’d be major economic devastation if a lot of these get implemented just to appease some power-mad folks (trade boss Navarro taught college but he also lost every [GOP-friendly] local election he ran in as a candidate ... think he loves being an unelected “mini-king” based on GOP criticisms).  Just to add on top of this, a lot of tariffs will be sidestepped by slightly inferior goods.   So the admin would likely be best served by getting what they can and focusing on a couple items where they aren’t fighting the biggest [donor] companies instead.",IronyElSupremo,2025-04-25T08:16:18,1
"In this context, yes.",Big-Plankton-4484,2025-04-25T07:37:52,2
