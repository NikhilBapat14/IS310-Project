"These are not ""reciprocal"" tariffs. Conservatives call things by false names, then the false names permeate the media, then it becomes the normal discourse. We mustn't help with that.",TheAskewOne,2025-04-03T02:24:03,7

The fact that he has to make a chart shows just crazy things have gotten. For a while I didn’t even know which tariffs were in effect Because they would be implemented and then either repealed or delayed.,Cool_Net_3796,2025-04-02T20:22:44,2

We need Hakeem to partner with some Republicans and bypass the speaker to take back Congress’ power to levy taxes just like the Senate did. Come on Hakeem! Now is your time,WearOk4875,2025-04-03T06:48:38,1
Companies were extraordinarily successful without these tariffs.  Tariffs are an effort to fix a problem that did not exist.  We focus on industries in which we have expertise and a competitive advantage and import from countries  that have an advantage in other industries.  It would be almost impossible for us to have an advantage in manufacturing due to labor costs.,metskyfan,2025-04-03T07:33:16,1

"What's wild is these aren't even what reciprocal tariffs are.   Someone calculated them and found the ""Tariffs Charged to the US"" column is simply the gross import/export deficit, so (gross import - gross export) divided by the gross imports. Then the ""reciprocal tariff"" is that number divided by 2.   Any country where that value fell below 10% was just set at 10% and any country that would have ballooned the other way due to sanctions were just omitted completely. That's why Russia, Belarus, NK, etc. weren't included.   Canada and Mexico were left off as well due to them being next door neighbors. Their import/exports were nearly identical leading to a near-zero differential. As a result, including them would have set them to 10% which would be a bold-faced lie considering we are currently in a trade war with them that has set much higher tariffs.   That's why countries that don't import much but export a ton like Cambodia have a wild 47% tariff now.",Smile_Space,2025-04-03T14:59:44,1

"1.) Don't obey in advance.   2.) The math behind these ""reciprocal tariffs"" suggests that he's done a calculation on the trade deficit for the goods traded between countries and decided that when the US purchases more goods that's a ""tariff"". This is not what economists mean by that word. And it ignores the services the rest of the world buys from the US, the digital goods, and the tourism.   Of course, he's driven a tank over the tourism dollars.",t92k,2025-04-02T21:53:18,6
