"The baseline deficit is now $1.8 trillion. The Republicans want to cut taxes/revenue by $500 billion for each of the next 10 years. In exchange, the hardcore Freedom Caucus wants $500 billion in annual spending cuts. At BEST we’re stuck with $1.8 billion deficits going forward.  Here’s the bigger problem. The Republican Senate only wants $150 billion in annual spending cuts. The Republican House has already backed off $90 billion of proposed annual Medicaid cuts, so the entire Republican budget proposal is already up in smoke.  In the end (by the end of the year basically) they need a 10-year tax plan. In all likelihood, the deficit hawks in the House will all fold except for two (Spartz and Roy) and the Republican House and Senate will agree to something like $200 billion annual spending cuts with $300 billion of gimmicks giving the illusion that the new tax plan is deficit neutral all the while solidifying $2.1 trillion or greater annual deficits in perpetuity. And they’ll celebrate it as if they won the Super Bowl.",Brundleflyftw,2025-05-08T00:29:24,21

"Media continuing to state the obvious, where they should write how to move forward, who to oppose and how.  Everyone knows Trump admin is authoritarian fanatics, or they will refuse to believe it. There's no point in debating it anymore. Shift the conversation to something more productive. Media facilitates the public discourse. It's the core of democracy. Take responsibility and act like it.",ToubDeBoub,2025-05-08T05:07:30,2

Of course Democrats could make it clear they won't approve any more debt ceiling increases. But that would take telling Trump his credit card is maxed out and they can't possibly stand up to him,ActualModerateHusker,2025-05-08T03:16:58,2
"The weird part of this is how they've been shouting from the rooftops about how the deficit needs to close to zero or cats and dogs will start living together. Do they expect the bond market to believe tariff payments will close the gap?  Or is this part of the theatre that leads up to a bond crisis where they cede authority to the executive to make massive cuts because it's an ""emergency""?",Alive_kiwi_7001,2025-05-08T06:18:09,1

That's a fine trade for a lot of them as long as they see minorities being hurt. Makes them feel superior.  some might even say supreme.  White and supreme.
