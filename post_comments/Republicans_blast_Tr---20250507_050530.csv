Show me sitting Republicans that are willing to stand up to Trump. They only do it when the votes are safe or they are retiring. Otherwise it's performative bullshit to save their ass.,longtermattention,2025-05-07T05:13:50,56
Amazing how the Republicans are actually siding with the guy who preaches anti-materialism and the economy going down. That was the one time that I felt they'd show up.,CT_Phipps-Author,2025-05-07T05:15:46,14

"Gee, I wonder how many dolls Ivanka had when she was growing up??  Why doesn't he just say, 'let them eat cake' and be done with it??

"Trump lives in a bubble of wealthy people. He recently discovered the word groceries, which he described as an old fashioned word. He is not concerned with groceries or other basics that working class people see as survival needs. Trump's tariff won't affect rich people so what does he care.",joekerr9999,2025-05-07T07:17:19,3

"Honestly, it’s kinda wild how even his own party is tired of the same lines. Feels like they want him to actually talk about real stuff for once instead of just repeating “everything was better before. Guess people are bored of hearing about dolls and want actual plans now.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-07T05:18:16,2
"What annoys me the most about the GOP is that Trump is enacting the largest tax increase on the country EVER, and you don’t hear any push back from these mealy mouthed cowards.  Trump is effectively putting a national sales tax increase place, and a whopper of one. But they all go mum at his very thinly veiled claim he has to do it using a national security act.  He has no business enacting  unilateral tax increases!  But the cowards in Congress will do nothing to stop this.  These fucks need to pay a heavy price at the ballot box come every election going forward.  I’m no fan of the geriatric, do nothing Dems, but I’d rather have demented Joe in office than this shit show any day of the week. And before all you fired Dem staffers pile on with everything Joe did, eat this: the main thing Joe didn’t do was put the right AG in place, someone who would have swiftly given us justice for January 6th, and possibly avoided Trump returning to power. But no, in good Dem tradition, it was Garland’s turn, let it be damned he was the worst choice for the times. The Dems are just as cowardly as the GOP.  Let the down voting begin, because the only messages that are promoted on here are the one line choruses of “slams” that create this ridiculous echo chamber on reddit.",[deleted],2025-05-07T06:00:01,3
"It's just about as tone deaf as you can get: a guy worth billions of dollars is trying to tell average Americans what ""enough"" is and why we should be happy with less? Nah, miss me with that.",pragmatichokie,2025-05-07T06:43:33,1
I guess that means we are going to be hearing a lot more about dolls.,CrawlerSiegfriend,2025-05-07T10:35:27,1
Why? This is what the MAGA base voted for. They want pain and suffering.  They want Daddy to take the take the belt off and give them a good whippin'. They knew what was coming when they voted for him and the big wigs knew all along when they supported him through the crimes and impeachments.,wauponseebeach,2025-05-07T11:04:45,1

You're getting it backwards.  It's that Trump always had 2 dolls:  current wife and Ivanka.,GrimlockN0Bozo,2025-05-07T07:57:47,3
"> What annoys me the most about the GOP is that Trump is enacting the largest tax increase on the country EVER, and you don’t hear any push back from these mealy mouthed cowards.   Fox News is still letting them believe other countries pay the tariffs. I'm not kidding, everyone who thought that 6 months ago STILL thinks that.   I had a full conversation about it yesterday with someone who is a previous colleagues and generally very intelligent. But politically he is all about Fox News.   He thinks that tariffs will balance the trade deficit back to ""0"" because other countries will have to ""pay their fair share to trade with America now""",Spam_Hand,2025-05-07T07:00:50,3
"At this point I genuinely think primary concerns aren't the problem (not entirely at least). A handful of congressman and ""anonymous sources"" have insinuated that Republicans are legitimately worried about the safety of themselves and their family members.   I don't think this excuses their inaction, but it does give some disturbing context if it's accurate. Never thought our country would be here.",fuckishouldntcare,2025-05-07T08:25:52,4

"Traditional conservative republicans have largely been displaced by Christian nationalists, making the republicans the party of “Tear it all down and rebuild it as God intended.”  Expect an onslaught of attacks on the separation of church and state to go along with their dismantling of our democracy.  Washington Spectator - [How the CNP, a Republican Powerhouse, Helped Spawn Trumpism, Disrupted the Transfer of Power, and Stoked the Assault on the Capitol](https://washingtonspectator.org/nelson-cnp/)  “Operating from the shadows, [the Council for National Policy’s] members, who would number some 400, spent the next four decades courting, buying, and bullying fellow Republicans, gradually achieving what was in effect a leveraged buyout of the GOP.”  HuffPost - [How Dominionists Gained Control Of The Trump Campaign](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dominionists-gain-control-of-trump-campaign_b_57c817d0e4b06c750dd8d25a)  “Dominionists believe that America is a Christian nation and they oppose the separation of church and state. Ted Cruz’s father is a Dominionist preacher. They mix well with Christian Reconstructionists who want to impose strict biblical laws on America including execution for adultery, blasphemy, and homosexuality. These two fringe religious groups make up the majority of the [Council for National Policy’s] 500 member base; along with a colorful array of extreme activists on the far right. The Council’s goal is to manipulate government agenda from within.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-07T11:10:52,2
"A rural local took ownership of my elderly next door neighbor's house. He has been flying a ""take AMerica back"" flag at his place for months. Funny, all work came to a screeching halt  a couple weeks ago and now the flag is not flying anymore.  The last thing they did was rip out the sheetrock, and since a lot  of sheetrock was coming out of China, I wonder if he got screwed.",Individual-Guest-123,2025-05-07T08:18:48,2

"You know what?  In for a penny, in for a pound but in they were nevertheless the very second they voted not to impeach him THE FIRST TIME.  They are continuing to abdicate their responsibility.    If they are afraid, simply get out of their government seat by resigning and hire security.    Otherwise, they are elected officials who SWORE to perform a sacred oath of service to their nation.
