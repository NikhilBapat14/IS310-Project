Everyone should remember that banning porn is one of the goals of Project 2025.  Expect something like this nationwide if Trump and those backing him get their way.,ProfessionalCraft983,2025-05-05T11:51:57,9
I'm sure that the good people of Utah and other righteous states are not interested in such things.  It's a simple typo.  Kindly redirect them to the mormonhub or bornagainhub websites.,I405CA,2025-05-05T11:40:38,5

"I live in a state that requires age verification and few sites do it, some like pornhub removed themselves and the rest just don‚Äôt care. Of course, the sites that don‚Äôt care also host more questionable content. Can‚Äôt imagine this is a good thing",PointedlyDull,2025-05-05T11:53:47,8
"> But PornHub‚Äôs block on Utah hasn‚Äôt stopped people from scrolling. In the weeks following the site‚Äôs decision, the number of Utahns downloading virtual private networks skyrocketed. VPNs allowed users to bypass the initial ban by appearing to log on from a different location. It‚Äôs a loophole Weiler knew about. Even then, he believes the law has done its job. >  > ‚ÄúCould a 17-year-old or 16-year-old get a VPN and circumvent this? Yeah, probably happens,‚Äù Weiler said. ‚ÄúCould a 7-year-old? Probably not. A 9-year-old? Probably not. An 11-year-old? Probably not.‚Äù  >  > While Weiler champions the law as a success, Stabile thinks it was never really about protecting kids. >  > ‚ÄúWhat the true goal of these laws was was to make it so difficult for anybody to access this content,‚Äù he said. >  > Additionally, Stabile thinks the law didn‚Äôt keep minors from accessing pornography. Rather, he said, the traffic shifted to other sites, some overseas, that don‚Äôt have protections for sex workers and don‚Äôt care about following a state law.",tech57,2025-05-05T11:48:06,12
It's OK Mormon's like soaking.,ManyReach7296,2025-05-05T15:53:56,3
I mean these porn bans only affect gooners. And in the article. They tried to sue and it didn‚Äôt work.¬†,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T11:57:07,-17
> ‚ÄúCould a 7-year-old? Probably not. A 9-year-old? Probably not. An 11-year-old? Probably not.‚Äù   These people vastly underestimate the intelligence of young men who want to see boobs. I probably could have at 9 and 100% could have at 11. Heck I had to figure out Usenet and combining 100+ part posts to see pron back in the early days. A VPN is 100x easier than that.,MasterK999,2025-05-05T12:15:10,27

"He‚Äôs either lying to himself or his voters.  Nothing incentivises kids of any age more than telling them they can‚Äôt do something and for those who can‚Äôt work it out, most will know someone or find a tutorial to show them how to do it.",Now_Wait-4-Last_Year,2025-05-06T02:27:00,2

"Tbf, getting a VPN to work is literally a two to three step process that a 6 year old could figure out by following a YouTube video which shows them how to do it step by step.  Unfortunately, getting geriatric politicians to understand how technology actually works is akin to convincing mosquitos that blood is icky. It just ain't gonna happen.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-05-05T16:33:02,5
