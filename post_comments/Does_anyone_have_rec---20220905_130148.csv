"If you're simply meaning by an eastern European author, there are plenty. Though I would also point out that ""western liberalism"" doesn't have a particular view on urban planning. How the English, Dutch, Germans, Italians and Spanish plan their cities are often wildly different, and even within these nations there is a great amount of variety. Compare Barcelona and Madrid to see what I mean. So many Eastern European views are not that different because after all in the grand scheme of planning, the line between eastern and western Europe was usually not a hard and fast line of division.   What is generally a little different is *Soviet* planning. It wasn't originally native to a region, it was designed by a combination of philosophy and utilitarianism. Even Soviet planning is not a pure monolith. In general they would build dense blocks of 4-12 story apartments of modest size, built to maximize building speed and minimize cost. Those blocks usually surrounded a series of services, small markets and generally social areas like parks. The idea is (a) quantity and (b) to try to foster communalism.  In the early soviet era, a considerable amount of the people were rural peasants with small dwellings on small farms without modern amenities. Partly because they were collectivizing small farms and partly to industrialize, there was a major effort to urbanize quickly. This meant apartments built in uniform models  and with just enough space for a family to not be crowded but with almost no extra beyond that. They built housing at a sustained rate that has arguably never been matched.   The Communalism aspect comes from the fact that they built them like dozens or hundreds of small ""villages"" within a city. Several thousand people sharing a school, park, grocery market, and usually a bus or tram stop. There was at many levels a distinct political ideology driving this, that the communist ideal would best be fostered living like that especially in comparison to how many western post-war planning and *especially* American post war planning was not centered around that at the time.  These ideas are not without comparable ideas in the west, many built government housing along this model but that would be only one piece of city planning rather than the central pillar like it was in Soviet dominated cities.   If this is what you're looking for there are small libraries talking about Soviet city planning.  If you want broader than that, know there is massive overlap between east and west Europe and that ""western liberalism"" is kind of a useless term hear because there is no agreement among western liberalism about how to design a city.",auandi,2022-09-06T11:35:59,2
"Very true, thanks very much. I should have been more specific with my wording I guess, I just read Dugin and was looing for more stuff like Koriakovtsev and Viskunov",oldhenchie,2022-09-07T13:22:41,1
