"What? No, Esquire, that's not how it works. The judge doesn't ""strike blows"" against legality.   Trump's deportation strategy is already illegal, what the judge has done is to look at the law, look at the actions, and find that they do not match. They're judging the facts of the case, not deciding what the law is. ",AccomplishedDust3,2025-05-02T08:27:29,17
