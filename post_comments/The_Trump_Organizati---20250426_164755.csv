"He also got a presidential seal spray painted by a climate activist this week.   A presidential seal in the Trump Tower is illegal: commercial use of the presidential seal is prohibited by 18 USC 713 of the US Code. This means individuals and entities outside of the government can not use the presidential seal for commercial, marketing, advertising, or promotional purposes. According to US Code Title 18, Section 506, unauthorized use of government seals, including the presidential seal, is illegal unless apparently you're running a dictatorship, and then you can get away with it.  The seal was defaced with removable chalk spray paint, and here is the statement from the activist:  ""I did this because I am an American. It is my duty to stand up for my country and my Earth when a government becomes destructive of our right to life. Donald Trump and the regime of private interests he works for — who donate equally to each party — are destructive of your inalienable right to life. All American political parties are equally complicit in inaction, which has brought us to this point.”  https://truthpress.com/news/climate-protester-arrested-after-vandalizing-presidential-insignia-at-trump-tower/",Financial-Special766,2025-04-26T17:28:45,8
