Bit late for that. If only the media had reminded people what the end of his last term was like instead of doing everything they could to explain how old Biden was.,normalice0,2025-04-23T09:30:10,18
Republicans were happy when he was hurting others  🤷🏽‍♂️,Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-04-23T09:54:31,4

"I guess people don't want to go back before global trade existed. I'm sure plenty of regular Americans who didn't think twice about where their merchandise was made are realizing it's rarely made in the USA. Trump is now saying he is going to lower the 145% tariff on China, that's all well and good, but has China even agreed to trade at this point.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-23T09:58:00,3
If only there was some way of knowing he is a bumbling moron without even the concept of a plan.,ciopobbi,2025-04-23T10:21:17,2

Yeah our credibility on the world stage is pretty much done since Americans have proven to be stupid enough to elect trump twice,DoubtSubstantial5440,2025-04-23T09:34:52,8

He claims a lot. I'll believe it when I see it.,Crusty_Musty_Fudge,2025-04-23T10:20:02,3
"Oh, it's not just Americans. The far right is well funded globally. Even though they lose often they are performing far too well for anyone serious about democracy to think it is just Americans being stupid and it will never happen anywhere else. It's starting to seem inevitable, really, as right wing billionaires have all the money and media.",normalice0,2025-04-23T09:38:37,6
