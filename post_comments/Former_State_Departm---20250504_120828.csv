This is why the judicial system is so important and must be impartial and free from threats.   The article doesn't mention whether the FBI was involved as well but I assume so.  I bet if we fully fund the IRS we'll find thousands (millions?) of tax cheats too.,Bubbly-Two-3449,2025-05-04T13:45:52,2
"I'm not sure who found the money. I know one of the people in Biden's inner group mentioned there were a bunch of receipts unaccounted for that looked like a person in the office had taken money, so I assume that would be an FBI thing rather than IRS or DOJ. Turns out she wrote 60 checks to herself and another person. I can't think why she didn't know she'd be caught. You can't just steal money.  Biden added 23k people to the IRS (16k probationary), and they reduced the IRS back to 10k added (from 77.4k to 102.3k to 90k) and hope to reduce by 22k over time with computer updates, retirements, less replacement, etc. Biden also added $80 billion - not sure if that's the cover worker costs.  Trump doesn't like income taxes in general, so he's not going to be pro more govt. Yale had a study they would find $7 billion more than the cost of added workers - but that's assuming there are enough people making over $400k to audit that haven't already been audited - the truly wealthy will have the money to make most of it legal, and those who are shady will be the first subjected to audit anyway. Plus, if they automate the system, it should run well with fewer people - as is the case with most of our jobs now. I'm not sure how the $7 billion would equal the $80 billion spent, but I assume someone looked into that.",lady__jane,2025-05-04T15:40:15,-1
"I'm worried that if the new people get bored, they'll go after and audit the poor schmucks not making bank, and we'll have to drag out all our pictures of things donated, our work space, etc.",lady__jane,2025-05-04T17:35:21,-1
