Is it still called deportation if they're citizens? Wouldn't it be more like kidnapping or human trafficking?,30mil,2025-05-08T05:38:54,2004

"Their excuse is that they didn't deport the children, they deported the parents who decided to take the kids with them.  Except that in at least one of these cases, a woman went in to ICE for a scheduled checkup with her toddler and they decided to deport her on the spot.  Then they gave her one single minute to call her husband and decide what to do with the kid.  And her only options were probably ""take the child with her"" or ""leave the kid in custody of ICE until her husband can get there.""  And given ICE's track record under Trump of kidnapping children from their families, that second option wasn't great.

"There are a lot of reasons for this. First off, the ones with the greatest political influence are working and middle class white Americans. Many of the former have been taken in by Trump, largely because of poor education. The latter are saddled with a very demanding work culture. If you're a professional in the US, expect to work at least fifty hours a week. That's not including commute, family obligations, etc. No matter how passionate you may be, it's not as easy as just joining a protest whenever it happens or trying to schedule an appointment with your representative or their staff across town (if you are lucky) in the middle of a work day. And depending on where you work, there is also the legitimate concern of dismissal due to political activism that is impermissible under the terms of employment. I work in education. Schools, colleges and universities often do not want staff engaging in political activism because it reflects on the institution and can draw backlash from family members of students or the community or, in the Trump era, the government. It's easy to say, ""take one for the team"" when it's not your team on the line. It's not your kids you're worried about feeding, or your retirement that you have to pay into. In the US, we don't even have the social safety net programs that allow greater flexibility in activism that you see in Europe. Often people are just stuck between a rock and a hard place. It's just good that we have as many demonstrations as we do under current market conditions.",PoetryJunior1808,2025-05-08T07:07:07,11

"It is often associated with that particular type of temporary immigrant, but that is not technically what it means. Technically, it means anyone who has left their country of origin for any reason and for any length of time. Practically, it’s most often used for well off western immigrants, who by circumstance also tend to be more temporary. For example, an immigrant from Guatemala to Canada typically immigrates with the intention of becoming a citizen and staying permanently. An immigrant from Canada to Guatemala is much more likely to be a temporary immigrant and self identify as an expat, as they may be there taking advantage of the low cost of living or a temporary work assignment, but unlikely to become a citizen and remain when they reach an age where they want access to a level of healthcare that is difficult to find in a developing country.    Take 2 temporary immigrants, one is a seasonal farm worker from Mexico that enters the U.S. on a work visa each summer. The other is a maintenance technician from the U.S. that has a one year contract on a military base in Iraq.

"That's untrue, let's not be overly dramatic.  Have you ever traveled with minor children ?  All they would need to do is have the custody documents and a passport for the minor children.    With the custody documents and children US passport, it really is easy.    The real question is: Is the mother that was deported willing to give up custody to someone in the United States and let her children grow up in the United States without her?     Is the mother willing to give the child away?  I don't know , at this point nobody knows.

"TL;DR: I keep going back and forth on this, because law is all about technicalities, but 18 USC Ch. 77 is fun to noodle on.  If prison labor is what you're getting at, then it's peonage/slavery/involuntary servitude, and then it's worse than trafficking, it's peonage or enticement into slavery, which are covered under 18 USC §1581 and §1583, which each carry a maximum sentence of life (when kidnapping is involved, which obviously it is). However, a careful reading of §1583 doesn't seem like it would quite apply, because it's counterintuitive to pay to give someone else a commodity. I wouldn't pay someone to take my car off my hands, for example.  Trafficking, covered under 18 USC §1590, really more applies to the people who do the transportation; that is, the pilots and the ICE agents.  That said, §1594(b) seems to include anyone involved in the conspiracy, though a coconspirator (e.g., Trump) would be charged under §1594 and not §1590.  On a side note, I'd draw your attention to §1593, which says,  >Whoever knowingly benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from participation in a venture which has engaged in any act in violation of this chapter, knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that the venture has engaged in such violation, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned in the same manner as a completed violation of such section.  ...which is pretty damning as well.   The last fun point I'd draw attention to is §1596, which extends US jurisdiction to any US national anywhere, or if the offender is in the US, no matter where they're from (cough cough, POES).",AlcibiadesTheCat,2025-05-08T16:55:25,1

"Read the article you fucking ghoul.      The father was sent to an ICE detention center then deported to Nuevo Laredo in Mexico, just across the border from Laredo, Texas.  The mother was released after being fitted with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet by the ICE Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP). She was instructed to check in at the new Pflugerville processing center on Tuesday.  “She was told that if she showed up, then she would be eligible for asylum as well as a work permit,” a spokesperson for Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based criminal justice and immigration advocacy group, told the Daily Beast.  The 39-year-old mother complied on the appointed day, bringing her kids along.  “Her understanding was that this was supposed to be a routine appointment,” the spokesperson said. “It was not a threat.”  But the mother and her kids then became the latest people to vanish into the immigration system and be held incommunicado. Grassroots Leadership and its legal team began an around-the-clock effort to locate them.  “We were just trying to figure out where she was,” the spokesperson said. “ICE was not giving us information.”  Grassroots Leadership repeatedly entered the woman’s alien registration number into the online ICE detainee locator.  “She wasn’t showing up,” the spokesperson said.  Early Wednesday afternoon, Parra Vargas telephoned the Grassroots folks to say she had been deported and was in Reynosa, just across the border in her native Mexico, 15 miles from where her husband ended up. Their three kids were with her—two of them citizens.  “When she called from the other side of the border, she said that she signed a paper, but she wasn’t sure exactly what it was,” the spokesperson told the Daily Beast. “She did not understand what she was signing.”  The legal team would no doubt have advised her that, as U.S. citizens, her younger two children could not be deported if she chose to place them with a responsible caretaker. But she does not seem to have been given the opportunity for an informed choice.  “She never had a chance to consult with anybody,” the spokesperson said. “Any efforts from our end to be able to advocate for her release, or even for our legal team to be able to work on her release, none of that was possible because we weren’t even able to locate her.”",Mutant-Cat,2025-05-08T10:35:44,3

When the decision is made unfortunately the authorities do not give you much time to decide.  That is just a reality.
