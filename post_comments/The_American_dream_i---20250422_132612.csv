"In all seriousness though, it’s wild we’re writing articles on “the american dream dying” while our country is simultaneously deporting people to concentration camps with no criminal background and no due process. It’s like, hey guys, you’re three years behind on this. We’re way passed this now. The American dream **is** dead. **Has been dead** and the country **underwent a coup** and **no longer abides by the constitution**.",ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T13:40:00,21

"Did it ever exist? C’mon. The American dream actually just came true, and it is a nightmare for the whole planet.  Dream big people /s",wiggmaster666,2025-04-22T15:49:31,4

"If you know anything about American history you know the American Dream only existed for white people in certain states from 1950-1974 or so.  For the rest of the people living in your country, the American Dream has included genocide, indentured labour, slavery, Jim Crow, lynchings, and massive deportations.  I would posit that the American state is simply returning to the mean.",awildstoryteller,2025-04-22T14:35:57,6

This 100%.  1950-1974 was an experiment in public relations for a country looking to gain influence in the world and alienate the Soviet Union.  No surprise that the slide back to the guilded age of pre1930’s ramped up after the fall of the USSR.,5minArgument,2025-04-22T15:25:35,2
"You’re not wrong at all, but I’m speaking within the framework of the average American. It wouldn’t be helpful for me to go “there never really was an American dream” without giving a history class and reeducating people which is not affective in terms of rhetoric.",ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T14:51:32,1
"Partially? Yes. But the Trump administration has broken things that cannot be simply be turned back on. Central economy to the world, allies, people republicans killed can't be resurrected, confidence in government and government jobs won't be there. So many things that require time to build are being destroyed.  It reminds me of the Taliban destroying the Buddhist statues.",CockBrother,2025-04-22T14:38:38,2
All of the functions of government that make this coup possible will still be there and the power vacuum historically just leads to another dictator.,ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T14:54:13,2
I think the line of bread and circuses has done a lot of good work in those 30 years.  The level of technology and entertainment even poorer members of society have access to would make even an extremely  wealthy person in 1970 jealous.   It is arguably how they have gotten away with so much.,awildstoryteller,2025-04-22T15:59:07,3
I think starting with the truth is a better strategy than bemoaning the loss of something very few ever experienced.,awildstoryteller,2025-04-22T14:58:06,0
"That is something I didn't understand with Biden.  I thought there would be actions taken to sure up the functions of government, restrictions, etcs.   That is what the next person needs to do. That is their main focus.",User-Name-8675309,2025-04-22T14:59:32,2

"You are speaking the truth, you’re just not boring people by trying to reeducate them on a dime. Effective rhetoric needs to be concise and to the point. It’s very much a “pick your battles” thing when we’re talking about effective rhetoric. That doesn’t mean I drop my principle on educating people of the complete class and race conscious reality, but I pick and choose when that is necessary.",ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T15:15:50,2
"Biden did the complete opposite. Merrick Garland refused to do anything with his power when he could have, and Biden made no effort to create any challenges for the next presidency. He handed over the presidency with a smile, which is not in tune at all with reality if you care about democracy. He should have been as obstructionist as he physically could have been able to (which is a lot considering that the supreme court ruled the president cannot be held liable for any official acts and have absolute immunity).",ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T15:19:11,2

No because you’re not lying. No one is saying the American dream wasn’t only about white people in the 50s. I’m just not giving them a history lesson every time I bring up the concept of “the american dream” as to not lose them,ChipNo6561,2025-04-22T17:55:40,1
