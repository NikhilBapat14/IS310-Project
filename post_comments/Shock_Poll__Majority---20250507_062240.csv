"Democrats are expected to double down on being Democrats every time a Democrat politician or elite shits on them.  (Why it's such a shocker when they don't.)  Case in point: the cities they run are all cyberpunk dystopia corporate slums but they always blame Republicans for this - this one key misrepresentation is one of the biggest pillars of American leftism.  The companies themselves are loudly and proudly leftist, they give 99% of their political donations to the left, they push the left's overton shifts and purity spirals, but yet every leftist sees their corporate overlords *as the face of the right.*  It's because they're watching TV shows all day every day, they don't observe or listen to the actual right they only listen to their corporate opinion panels telling them how every part of the political spectrum operates from the same McNews desk.  The system breaks down and ceases to function when they get people who don't binge watch TV. Hollywood magic *just doesn't apply* outside the box.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-07T17:47:06,4
"In the city of Dearborn, where some 55 percent of residents are of Middle Eastern descent, Trump won with 42.48 percent of the vote over Vice President Kamala Harris, who received just 36.26 percent. The Green Party’s Jill Stein, who campaigned heavily on ending Israel’s onslaught on Gaza, received 18.37 percent. In 2020, an impressive 74.20 percent of voters in the city had cast their ballot for Biden.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-05-07T06:32:25,8
