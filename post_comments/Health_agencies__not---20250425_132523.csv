"Why would anyone believe that when all this administration does is lie. The NIH specifically said they would be ""developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism"" and now won't say why they said that. Just more tired, old 'trust us"" bullshit.",brithus,2025-04-25T13:30:29,45

Okay. They've gotten unexpected backlash so now they're backtracking publicly. But which is it really? These Nazis can't even agree on which evil plans they're going to enact on any given day.,earthfever,2025-04-25T14:08:55,10
"Right, they're creating a registry of everyone with any chronic condition or illness so those people can \*all\* be sent to ""wellness camps.""",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-25T14:47:22,9

"While, as someone on the autism spectrum, I would like to believe this is the last time they'll try to pull this crap, this particular administration can't stop lying, so any celebrations may be naive.",jayfeather31,2025-04-25T16:29:55,1

"Correct me if I’m wrong, but it sounds like this info was and is already available to NIH and researchers, and they’re just consolidating it into one place. Is that right?",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-25T13:29:56,0

"Thinking they won’t send everyone to wellness camps, just a select exceptional few that won’t comply so they can be used for intimidation.   My speculation is actually many people with chronic illnesses or mental issues won’t be immediately sent to the wellness camps. Regardless they’ll always be at risk of it especially in places of employment: if they act out… if they aren’t able to function well or need assistance… if they speak up… there’ll probably be a citation or warning system? Penalty points that’ll add up and incase they’re bad at their jobs and accrue too many, the they’ll be sent to these camps for treatment and discipline.   The US is pushing for more people to breed. They need employees and my speculation is that rather than everyone being sent first to actual prison industrial complexes or camps, that work places or schools will instead *adopt* practices of the prison industrial complex.",Full_Maintenance_252,2025-04-25T15:58:10,1
I do not trust the Trump administration. Period.,fairoaks2,2025-04-25T13:33:16,11
"The NIH specifically said they would be ""developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism"". They are spending $50 million to do it so it isn't something already in place. They had also claimed it was to study autism and treatments but they also just cut funding for those two areas.",brithus,2025-04-25T13:35:23,23
"If these people need Medicaid, Medicare, or Obamacare to pay their medical bills, they may not get that support and be left to suffer or die. Especially if they are elderly, disabled, or have a chronic illness  that renders  them unable to work.",FormerUsenetUser,2025-04-25T16:23:19,2
"Ahh got it I hadn’t looked too closely when it was announced earlier this week, didn’t realize there were two components to it. Personally I think consolidating the data is a good move in any scenario, but an actual registry is scary.",Horton_Takes_A_Poo,2025-04-25T14:02:09,2
