"Trump famously has a long-running obsession with the size of his hands—an insecurity so deep he once felt compelled to announce, “My hands are normal hands,” to the *Washington Post*’s editorial board while running for president in 2016.  *Spy* magazine co-founder Kurt Andersen explains how he helped plant that insecurity more than 30 years ago, when the publication first called Trump a “short-fingered vulgarian,” on [the latest episode of *The Daily Beast Podcast*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WD3YxtVwxik).

"Damn... I miss Spy Magazine... I had a subscription to it a few years after it started. There was a good deal of content on Donald Trump but back then I had no idea who he was and I just remember his face in the pages. It, at least to me, is a shame who ever owns the magazine's content hasn't put it up on line, I'd love to go back and take a look...",invalidreddit,2025-05-09T13:04:04,2
