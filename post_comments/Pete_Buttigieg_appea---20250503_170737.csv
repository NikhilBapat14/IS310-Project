He is by far our best speaker and if he was straight he would be a shoo-in for 28 and we would be so lucky.  Sadly identity politics even on the left will keep him out. Hopefully he one day gets his chance.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T17:27:59,74
"Regardless of whether Mayor Pete represents your particular politics - I love that he's modeling that Dems need to go to places and venues that aren't necessarily friendly and convince them, or at least not be afraid to have a conversation.   This includes podcasts like Rogan, it includes UFC fights, football games, places where Americans pay attention and listen.   He is uniquely equipped to do this because he's very bright and well spoken, so having a debate with anyone is not something he needs to shy away from. We need more of that. Convincing people who already agree with you does nothing.",trialofmiles,2025-05-04T06:34:02,7

And the flagrant fan base didn’t care. All they cared about was how he took 3 months off after he and his husband adopted a kid. Dumb move by mayor Pete that nobody will soon forget.,LoudSituation2321,2025-05-03T19:18:24,-20
"I disagree as long as he doesn’t focus his campaign around being a gay man.  People will ignore those kinda things if you don’t talk about them much, and they are not obvious.  For example, one of the reasons I believe Obama was able to get so many white people to vote for him, he won Iowa twice for crying out loud, was because he didn’t talk much about being black and if you weren’t able to see him, you probably wouldn’t know.  If you didn’t know anything about Pete you probably wouldn’t know he was gay.  He really has a shot in my opinion.",short71,2025-05-03T21:51:35,7
"I think it’s time establishment dems caved to progressive dems for a change. He does phenomenal work and I would never suggest he isn’t a master class in what he does. To be clear, I will vote for any dem in the general election, donate, and help their campaign.   I just hope it is a genuinely progressive voice that I have the opportunity to vote and do all of that for.I know some will argue he is quite progressive but his specific demeanor is too formal for me to ever relate.",Th3HappyCamper,2025-05-03T18:09:28,19
"I wouldn't vote for him given a choice tbh. Pete is likeable but also fully on the neo liberal corporate ""donation"" teat to the point where he refuses to even discuss campaign finance reform, much less once again outlawing bribery.   Our biggest problem isnt Trump or MAGA or white supremacy or even the GOP; it's blatant corruption. We either confront that or accept that we live in an oligarchy now. There's no more in-betweening when supreme court judges are openly taking bribes and the president is charging millions for meetings. You're either on the side of the American people or you're claiming your seat on the gravy train. Pete likes the gravy.",Beneficial_Soup3699,2025-05-04T15:29:17,-2

"What he did on the flagrant pod is something I don't think anyone else in the party is capable of and opened their minds (AOC is able to reach people that no one else in the party can similarly).

"That is a perfectly valid opinion and assertion. However, I do not agree and you haven’t supported your claims to encourage me to change my mind.   You might be appealing to “common sense” but history hasn’t been kind to those cozying up to or aligning themselves even slightly with authoritarians.",Th3HappyCamper,2025-05-03T18:55:05,13
"That’s not true, and that’s how we got here. Social society depends on what we normalize as “okay” and moral. Morality shifts, depending on cultural forces.   If democrats actually work on messaging (which they haven’t been good at in a while, because they rely on having good policy), they can get moderates AND Republicans with a message about caring for one another. They just need to get sympathetic, kind messengers, that are also bulldogs when it comes to bigotry and suffering. This is especially true when people are about to be suffering due to Trump’s policies.   Offering the same old, same old to people who had a system that didn’t work for them causes them to just sit out voting. Public opinion on policy isn’t fixed. It’s moveable, if you have a good enough storyteller, who can build big enough of a platform.   Democrats wait too long to hear about polling data, and make decisions on that, instead of slowly pushing the conversation, so that the progressive policies get normalized. They just need to be united in doing so. Call out the cruelty happening, and offer an alternative vision.",kateg22,2025-05-03T19:33:21,7

"McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, whenever the dems go left the Republicans get 400 votes minimal.     Show me the progressives that consistantly win in swing districts, most of the squad are in seats that haven't elected a Republican representative in about 50 yrs.   Progressive can barely win primaries for anything bigger than a congressional district.  The Justice Democrat backed candidate for mayor of NYC (Maya Wiley), came third to an anti defund the police, police captain.  Cynthia Nixon got trounced by Cuomo in one of the bluest states, Gretchen Whitmer became the first dem candidate in michigan history to win all 83 precincts over her Bernie backed opponent El-Sayed.  Or when a progressive did win a primary in the deep blue city of Buffalo, only to lose to the anti defund the police incumbent as a write in.   Why do you think the progressives themselves only primary dems in safe congressional seats with narrow parameters, where pretty much all of them are tightly confined to metropolitan cities.  They complain about Manchin or Sinema but would they primary them ? Nah because they know they would have no hope.",Erskinepurple,2025-05-03T19:23:49,13
"I get tired of hearing that Democrats are bad on Messaging. Because it’s simply not true. The Messaging on the ACA was very good, but the Republicans told Americans that the Democrats were gonna have death panels and kill grandma. Guess who they believed.

"Biden had one of the most progressive administrations in the past couple of decades. He implemented the first UBI for families with children. He initiated a huge green energy plan. He expanded eligibility for healthcare And limited the cost of some prescription drugs.

Well said. Though I think we might frustrate each other if we keep going as I personally believe that past data is no longer useful under the current climate. I don’t have any disagreements with what you’ve said I just don’t think it is relevant anymore.

"Democrats have better policy, but the reason I say their messaging is bad is because they can’t break through the Republican noise. Republicans have a messaging empire, where they are able to test their message with right wing influencers, and have what is successful bubble up.   There is nothing similar on the left, and the left needs to develop their own strategy with building messaging (I don’t believe the same methods will work on the left and right). Democrats need to get better at listening to anecdotal opinions, rather than polling. Talking with individual conservatives, and see what messaging works on them.   They are losing the conversation, because they don’t have a way to test their message in a lower stakes context to see what breaks through the noise.",kateg22,2025-05-04T02:31:24,1

"I disagree with this mindset as much as I do with its antithesis. It’s just as bad as the first take that advocated for ignoring lessons from history. We shouldn’t ignore the past, no, but we shouldn’t let it dictate what we think can happen, either. It is there to guide us on what could happen, not to tell us what will be. There were people said more or less the same as you with nearly every major progressive milestone in our history. It’s always ‘history says it could never happen’… until it happens.   Yes, past is often prologue, but we are also masters of our own destiny, ultimately. In this moment, right now, we have the power to change what happens next. What we do with that power doesn’t always result in a major leap forward, like it would be if we were to elect our first openly gay president, but sometimes it does. If the past is, in a certain case, prologue, the chance of that leap happening at any given time might usually be lower that the chance that we get more of the same old shit. But the the probability of change is still not zero. It’s equally erroneous to believe that as it is to believe that historical data on this matter is somehow irrelevant, like the first guy.   Both viewpoints have some validity too, though. One could say that election outcomes, both from history and recent times, have shown us just how unlikely it is for a gay man to be elected president. However, the current backlash against this admin and the era of turmoil they seem intent on ushering us into, historically speaking, can have a funny way of sparking progress, sometimes on a wide sweeping scale, in which case we could see that pattern upset.   Both outcomes are possible. For all we know, in two years, the right-wing establishment will be falling apart as the consequences of their actions drive people towards more progressive ideologies in droves. Such a thing might not seem likely right now, but there is historical precedent for it. Just as there have been politicians whose campaigns have been detailed by even just rumors of homosexuality… there have been points in history where widespread instability and political/social turmoil creates opportunities for change and reform.   Ignoring the numerous examples either of those things is a failure to learn from history, regardless of which one of you turns out to be right in the end. Honestly, you know what I think? Humans being bad at learning from history is not the problem. Our real issue is being bad at interpreting the future. If one looks hard enough, you can string together a series of historical arguments to support what you believe will happen and still be wrong. That doesn’t necessarily mean one didn’t learn from history. I find that that it is actually more common that it just means one didn’t apply what you learns effectively enough to alter the outcome, or else didn’t adequately consider all the relevant information.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-04T00:41:40,5

You said:  > It doesn’t matter how well you outline the wonderful plans you have for a group of people, who respond better to hate and fear.

"I wasn't arguing against Pete Buttigieg i was arguing against running a progressive candidate, Buttigieg is not a progressive, i think he would be a good candidate.   Before Whitmer 💩 the bed in the oval office hiding behind her folders my picks for the next Dem ticket were Whitmer-Buttigieg, Whitmer-Gallego or Shapiro-Stacey Abrams.  Now that Whitmer has blown it i would promote Buttigieg to the top of the ticket with him having Abrams as VP as well",Erskinepurple,2025-05-04T02:48:09,0
"Oh alright then. I kinda suspected, but I went with that as an example.   Doesn’t really matter. You can replace “gay man” with ‘progressive’, or anything else you want. My argument still holds up.   It could be ‘black man’ (we’ve seen that one already) or ‘socialist’. The whole point of everything I wrote is that you are still not taking a very broad view of history when you argue against running a progressive candidate, or any kind of particular candidate you think has bad electoral prospects. You’d have to take a selective view of history and ignore the full historical precedent to really support any sort of those arguments. Because if you look hard enough, you’ll find historical examples that will contradict your prediction.   It’s not as though we have not had progressive presidents for their time before. FDR and Wilson, anyone? Honestly, to me, arguing the case that we shouldn’t run progressives because of ‘history’ is even dumber than arguing that a gay man wouldn’t have a good chance.   Progressive policies are overwhelmingly popular when you poll people on the issues themselves, and historically speaking, while it may not happen in the immediate future, it’s almost statistically certain we will elect someone pushing progressive ideas again, eventually. Barring a total collapse of the system, of course.",nikolai_470000,2025-05-04T08:49:43,1
