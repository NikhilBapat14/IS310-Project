"I hope and pray that I never become so morally bankrupt and inhuman that I would stand there and even try to find a way to justify why something like this is actually okay to any degree.   Anyone who thinks for even a second that that makes a difference or justifies deporting a 2-year-old American from her rightful home, has rotted inside.",SpoppyIII,2025-04-26T14:30:17,8
"I hope I never put being technically correct over my own empathy and compassion for a child. To have made that kind of deal with myself and express it publicly would represent an abandonment of a majority of my personal beliefs and morals. Weaponizing such an act as a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù against people I disagree with in a trivial and fleeting interaction for absolutely no gain on the part of anyone involved would constitute the debasement of whatever remained of those beliefs about how my fellow humans, and especially innocent children, deserve to be treated. None of that even addresses the alignment with a party who cries that they are on the side of families and children at every turn, and then takes every opportunity to aid a family trying to make their children‚Äôs lives better to tell them to go fuck themselves in the strictest verbal, physical, and political terms, and then accuses the other side of weaponizing politics. If comments like this constitute your contribution to discourse and our country, then you have already produced a far more negative effect on our collective wellbeing than this child has, and yet they are the one being banished from a country. It‚Äôs sickening.  Edit: also, the headline is appropriate, as it never suggests that they were deported alone, and the article provides appropriate detail. It is factually correct that the United States government has deported a two-year-old citizen. The title does not say ‚Äúalone‚Äù or ‚Äúwithout their family‚Äù or anything similar. The fact that that was the first aspect of this story that you could come up with as a defense is also very telling. The way the headline is worded does not change the facts of the story and is the least objectionable thing about it, if it‚Äôs even objectionable to rationally thinking people in any way.",FartVirtuoso,2025-04-26T17:58:58,2
