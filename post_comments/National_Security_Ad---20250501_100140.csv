Every person on that chat who didn’t immediately speak to shut it down committed a prison-worthy crime.    Hegseth copy and pasting highly classified war/attack plans is an extra crime on top.  Hegseth lying about it numerous times is felony and/USMJC obstruction.  The people who lied under oath about.  Hegseth having other breaches and other non-secure chats on non-secure lines.  In a sane America he’d never leave prison.,AntoniaFauci,2025-05-01T12:22:57,13
"To them, he’s the real problem especially because he has a neocon past and known ties to Cheney. The fact that he’s on speaking terms with Goldberg (he can deny this all he wants but they were photographed together years ago) further their suspicion of his disloyalty. There’s even a theory that waltz is a mole and invited Goldberg on purpose.",birdsemenfantasy,2025-05-01T13:27:56,1

Lemme recheck my history but I’m _pretty_ sure the German leaders weren’t brought to justice before their government fell. And the ICC wasn’t really a thing before the 1990s - none of them were tried in The Hague. ,BeowulfShaeffer,2025-05-01T12:15:30,5

I don't see much difference in the neoconness between Bush/Cheney Republicans and most of MAGA. Except you get all the jingoism/aggressive foreign policy without the actual loyalty or patriotism to the US (because they are loyal to Russia). And that aggression isn't reserved just for enemies of the US but is also imposed on allies—namely NATO allies in compliance with Putin's geopolitical goals.,Hillary4SupremeRuler,2025-05-01T21:19:56,2
