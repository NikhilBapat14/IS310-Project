"GET YOUR FACTS STRAIGHT. TRUMP MADE THE DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY LET THE FOLLOWING FACTS SINK INTO YOUR PEA BRAIN.  FACT:  ● Donald Trump cut a secret deal with the Taliban that freed 5,000 Taliban fighters, sending them back to the battlefield to regain strength – ultimately putting the Taliban in its strongest military position in 20 years and helping lay the groundwork for the challenges during the Afghanistan withdrawal. ● Trump invited the Taliban to Camp David just before the anniversary of 9/11 without involving the Afghan government or America’s international allies. ● After the Camp David scheme fell apart, Trump subsequently cut a deal directly with the Taliban that freed 5,000 imprisoned fighters, allowing them to return to the battlefield to regain strength, and put the Taliban in its strongest military position in 20 years. ● Trump proceeded with talks despite reliable intelligence that the Taliban did not intend to abide by the deal’s terms, and he even acknowledged that they could “possibly” take over the Afghan government after U.S. withdrawal. New York Times: “Trump’s Deal With the Taliban Draws Fire From His Former Allies” ● Trump’s deal made major concessions and left the U.S. with only 2,500 troops in Afghanistan when President Biden took office—the smallest force since 2001. ● The deal set timelines for withdrawal and gave permission for the Taliban to attack U.S. troops if the timeline wasn’t met. ● Trump left the Biden-Harris administration with zero plans for an orderly withdrawal—only a dangerous, costly mess. Trump even bragged that the Biden-Harris administration “couldn’t stop the process” he started. ● Trump’s own former national security advisor admits that Trump bears responsibility for the challenges of the withdrawal.  FACT: ● President Biden did what was necessary to end America’s longest war, and as Vice President Harris has said, it was the right and courageous decision. ● After 20 years, more than $2 trillion, and 800,000 servicemen and women on the ground fighting a war with no end in sight, nearly 2,500 service members dead and over 20,000 wounded, President Biden ended America’s longest war and brought our troops home.  ☆☆☆President Biden’s choices for how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by Donald Trump.☆☆☆  ● The Biden-Harris administration led the largest airlift in U.S. history, evacuating over 120,000 Afghans, U.S. citizens, and Afghan allies.  BIDEN DID WHAT HE NEEDED TO DO BECAUSE OF THE DEAL TRUMP MADE. BIDEN TRIED TO NEGOTIATE FOR MORE TIME TO WITHDRAWAL BUT WAS DENIED. HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO WITHDRAWAL WHEN HE DID. TRUMPS REMOVAL OF 95% OF OUR TROOPS, LEFT US EXTREMLY VULNERABLE & ILL EQUIPPED TO HANDLE AN UNENCUMBERED WITHDRAWAL, WHICH IS HOW WE LOST 13 TROOPS... AND DON'T GET IT TWISTED AND LET YOUR IGNORANCE BELIEVE NO TROOPS WERE LOST UNDER TRUMP. MORE THEN 67 WERE LOST UNDER TRUMPS TERM.....

The Minsk Agreements in 2014/2015 called for a ceasefire, the withdrawal of all foreign armed groups and a constitutional reform recognising the special status of Donetsk and Luhansk,... and sorry but you're wrong, none of that held, there was never a crease fire, which means the conflict continued, even under Trump.... and during his term we absolutely still played a part. We  provided aid in the form of weapons, same as we do now.... so yes we were involved in, and a part of war related issues. There is also no difference whether an attack on a sovereign nation happens by land or sea, it is still an act of war. We also did not just willy nilly decide to become involved in these wars either,...as if treaties and other accords we have with other countries don't matter....nor does any one president have control over who decides to start a conflict. Obamah = Crimea/ Donbas/Afghanistan, Trump = Afghanistan/Donbas/Syria & almost Iran, Biden = Ukraine / Isreal.

I meant the Minsk held because Putin did not invade like he did on NOT ALL THERE Biden regime.   It wasn’t till Kamala was sent to Ukraine to stupidly say Ukraine was joining NATO in a public speech and due to the consent poking of the Bear by Biden and military industrial complex, not to mention the overthrow cue by Our own CIA of the Ukrainian president that set some of the stage for unrest that followed.   Obama said to trump that the most dangerous regime he would face right away was North Korea who had been messing with rockets thru Obama’s term and others terms as well.  And what did trump do but meet the freaking guy on North Korean soil!   The first president ever to do that in modern times and trump defused that danger in no time with out a shot fired.

If you actually believe Trump had anything to do with the Abraham Accords other then hosting the signing for publicity, your saddly mistaken. The Abraham Accords extended diplomatic relations between Israel and only some Arab countries, that were not engaged in military conflict, it did not achieve peace across the Middle East. Go ask Palestinians how they felt about the accords and how they were a means to presure them into a peace deal. In reality, the accords simply elevated and formalized relations between countries that already maintained backchannel ties. Moreover, because none of the parties to the Abraham Accords were ever engaged in military conflict the framing of normalization as peace is a gross misrepresentation of what the agreements actually achieved. The parties involved also had growing concerns over Iran which only further persuaded their decisions to come together.... and for s••ts and giggles, lets not forget that Trump abandoned the nuclear deal that Obama made with Iran.
