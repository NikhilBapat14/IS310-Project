"You do not need NATO's permission to go to war.  NATO's main focus is collective defense, not preventing countries from going to war.  There have been numerous instances where NATO countries went to war, where other members opposed, and nothing happened because that is non-NATO issue (e.g. 2003 invasion of Iraq).",Naliamegod,2023-03-24T22:47:41,7
"NATO is a defensive alliance, so nothing would happen if a country went to war elsewhere. The only way NATO would get involved is if that country started losing the war, and their sovereign territory was under attack.",ProLifePanda,2023-03-27T15:39:08,2
"Nothing, they just wouldn’t get any support from the alliance. Iraq wasn’t a NATO expedition. In fact Germany and France both condemned it.",Nikola_Turing,2023-04-01T15:24:46,1
