"It's funny how petroleum has been a national security issue for the US but, petroleum pricing isn't. We spend taxpayer money to secure oil companies so they can jack up the prices for the consumers.",EmptyEstablishment78,2025-05-07T04:30:44,166
"So I don't know about this refinery issue. But some comments here have talked about refineries closing elsewhere (on the Gulf Coast which is assuredly in a red state) so this isn't a specific California issue. On top of that, for decades, many, many decades, people around me (in the southeast USA) have talked about how regulations kill economic growth and California is the worst at it. Meanwhile... it does seem like California is doing pretty well economically and in population growth.  So is regulation really killing industry in this case or is this just another case of something happening in California that's happening around the county and people who don't like regulation looking to it and saying ""That, that's why!""",Hobbit_Sam,2025-05-07T10:15:25,18
I work closely with oil refineries. I seriously doubt we're going to see any refineries close.  Maybe one here and one in Southern California but I think it's more likely they'll shift production; they don't just make gasoline.   These companies are masterful at manipulating public perception and they have the resources to do it effectively. The cost to dismantle a refinery would be astronomical.   And why is this a democrat issue?,SanFransicko,2025-05-07T04:17:09,85
California gas prices are high even when you live next chevrons oil refinery.  California gas prices are high when oil refineries leave.   Gas prices in neighboring states always half the price. It's a sham that they are allowed to get away with. I used to live right next to the Richmond Chevron plant. Gas prices were never cheap anywhere around there.,postdiluvium,2025-05-07T06:58:24,21
"Each state sets its own refining standards.  California has opted to create a standard that no one else chooses to follow.  Accordingly, the supply of that fuel is limited, as few producers bother with it.  Meanwhile, the money in the oil industry is in the upstream (exploration and controlling the reserves), not in the downstream.  Refining is a low margin business with high barriers to entry, so it doesn't attract much interest.  Accordingly, the free market has little reason to devote resources to addressing the state's (self-inflicted) problem.  The state has two basic options: Either adopt more common standards or else treat refining as a public utility and get into the refining business.  The problem should be easy to understand.  The solutions are debatable.",I405CA,2025-05-07T14:37:34,5
"Actually, the closure stems from regulations to protect consumers from what is seen as price gouging from the oil industry: https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/16/phillips-66-california-refinery-closure-00184058  Environmental regulations are only an excuse as they see long term demand going down anyway. And short term, there's not ,uch demand for diesel: the tariffs are wrecking the economy.  The truckers aren't driving and the ships aren't refueling.  There is excess capacity in the US, the oil barrel price is low, no one is drilling. Imports are more dificult due to counter tariffs from some countries too.  They needed to ahut down these refineries in a few years, but they are doing it now, blaming the environmental regulation.  But remove all of California's environmental regulation and you bought yourself a few months at most.  And at what cost?   As for the surging oil price, the market will adjust.  Smaller cars will be offered, electric engines will replace diesel engines for some engine types.  There will be a short spile in price, people will travel less, governments will have to increase their offer of public transit and revise their urban planning in the future.  Eventually, price will back down after garnering national media attention and Trump promise to fix this.  Just more drama.  Other countries have similar laws, they have relatively high gaz prices and they survive.",KoldPurchase,2025-05-07T04:34:34,26

The whole point of decarbonization is to make fossil fuel alternatives more economical than fossil fuel. California's weather makes it a great candidate for EV conversion. Gasoline SHOULD be $6/gallon there. And you don't 100% need an ev. With fuel efficient hybrids and plug-in hybrids $6 gas is still not completely unaffordable.   $6 gas only destroys your budget if you have an unnecessarily huge truck or SUV. Commercial shipping will adjust accordingly. $6 gas is a small price to pay for decarbonization.,Prince_Marf,2025-05-07T17:12:12,0

"> drilling less elsewhere in the US, they're shutting down operations  https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/oil-and-gas/oil-and-gas-industry-outlook.html  Overall Production is Expected to Increase: The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that U.S. crude oil production will actually increase in 2025, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years, reaching record highs. This growth is primarily driven by the Permian Basin.  Rig Counts are Slightly Lower: While production is increasing, the number of active oil rigs has seen a slight decline compared to a year ago. This indicates that companies are becoming more efficient, producing more oil with fewer rigs through techniques like longer lateral drilling.  Focus on Efficiency and Shareholder Returns: Many exploration and production (E&P) companies are prioritizing capital discipline, focusing on generating returns for shareholders through dividends and buybacks rather than aggressive production growth. Investment is strategic, aimed at maximizing profitability and operational efficiency.  Regional Variations and Specific Closures: While overall drilling may not be decreasing, there are specific instances of operations being shut down, particularly refineries in California. These closures are often attributed to factors like high operating costs, strict environmental regulations, and a shift towards lower-carbon energy sources. The closure of refineries, however, is different from the shutting down of drilling operations, though it can impact the overall oil supply chain.

"This isn’t saying costs have gone up, this is saying costs could go up. Crude prices could go up, California could require labor to be paid at a higher rate, or raise taxes, many other materials could increase in cost.  And the law changed made it far more difficult to change pricing based on costs.  As you say, prices change, not just in this business but in others. Let me make an example, let’s say a CA city raises the minimum wage to $30 an hour, but also passes a law saying businesses cannot raise prices. What do you think those businesses will do? They would close.  If you ran a business and the city or state you lived in mandated you would lose money you would close or sell, that is the reality of it.",TheMikeyMac13,2025-05-07T11:03:47,5

We give massive breaks to tech giants, pharmaceutical companies, and the entire green energy industry, most of which are backed by billionaires and turn huge profits.
