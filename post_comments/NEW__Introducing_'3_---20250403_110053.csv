"Winning the House is achievable and an essential piece of the ""stop Trump"" strategy. In 2024, Democrats lost the House by just 7,309 votes—that’s less than the crowd at a Texas high school football game.  Republicans are already making moves to defend their razor-thin majority, but we have a path to overcome it. We only need to gain 3 more seats.  We can do it if we focus our efforts on competitive swing districts, where it will be most impactful.  Everyone can make a difference, and our work starts now. Opportunities to take action:  * [**Host a Swing Left gathering**](https://swingleft.org/host/learn-more): The fight ahead is a marathon and digital fatigue is real. Winning starts with face-to-face connections that help us build power. Bring together three friends or 30 neighbors, and we’ll provide a guide, script, and everything you need to get started. * [**Attend a Swing Left gathering**](https://www.mobilize.us/swingleft/?tag_ids=26131): Not ready to host your own?
