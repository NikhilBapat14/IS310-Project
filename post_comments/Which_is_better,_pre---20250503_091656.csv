"I live under a Presidential system, and I wish every day that we had a Parliamentary system. Imagine a government with a clear mandate, deliberately formed by an agreement on what policies to enact, that would be easily dissolved upon losing its mandate, instead of a near-perpetual performative deadlock that is re-upped every two years on the nose, where the only way to get anything done is if huge numbers of people happen to hate the other party for something right around October/Novemberish.   EDIT: then again maybe this is a USA problem and not a Presidential problem. Curious to hear perspectives from other countries.",GiantPineapple,2025-05-03T09:30:28,74
The US is proof how a presidential system can be undermined when the Legislative and Judicial Branches both bow down to the Executive Branch and the checks and balances disappear like smoke in the wind. What makes the current situation especially depressing and frustrating is how easy it happened. Conservative members of Congress and Supreme Court Justices have given up their powers with barely any fight at all.  I'm not familiar with parliamentary systems. Have there been any recent examples of how easy it is to undermine the safeguards built into that system?,TJ_McWeaksauce,2025-05-03T09:50:02,40

"I think either system can work.   Maybe the American factor though is that we stopped civic mindedness maybe in the 70s and allowed the wealthy to legislate PACs so that corpos can vote. It really allowed corpos to begin skirting various limits that had been put in place as they increased their power through tech and politics. Some of those moves introduced media platforms that the rich could control and reach millions but that also didn't have to follow the Fairness Doctrine (thanks Ronnie, ya fukwit). This brought us reality TV which really washed out several platforms that were providing educational, diy, science programming just by being more profitable. Dumb and dumber.  It boils down to the country is for the people and by the people.   It can't be for businesses or religions. Each vote matters and maybe we need mandatory registration and voting to fix that.  And ""woah"" I know we are free to decide to vote or not but our worst weakness is being Free to the point of killing ourselves and our country.  For the system to work, we must do the responsible thing so that we can earn the freedom allowed within that system.    People mostly forget the end of that statement ""by the people"".  That infers there's a personal responsibility to do for the country.   For the country to work,",o-Valar-Morghulis-o,2025-05-03T10:17:07,6
"The presidential system works, if an elected congress is effective. The American system as built does an okay job of balancing representation, but when we capped the House of Representatives, we messed up everything else. If you go purely off the Wyoming rule, there would be a total of approximately 579 reps, and 679 electoral votes. I’d say go even further to two per Wyoming, that way they never out represent the senate.   Also, diluting power of representatives is okay in my book. Much more costly to try and bribe/lobby a representative. Much easier for the common man to run for election if you’re only having to influence up to 300k people. Or a neighborhood in Brooklyn.   The federal system we have has been morphed to skew representation, and to me that’s also from making the senate a popular vote rather than the actual interface between national and state governments. LA and San Francisco have their interests represented on the national stage despite the state government having different interests on behalf of the rest of the state.   Parliamentary systems work great at diluting out the power and importantly forcing some level of cooperation between parties. They are also flexible enough to allow changeouts of power via elections as needed. They allow for career politicians that aren’t themselves beholden to election cycles.   The downside is that ultimately it is giving power to a political party and not the people. It makes an external organization more powerful than the government in a weird way. For instance even in the US with our formed two party system, a large part of the struggles of the Democratic Party to go against MAGA is that Democrats must fall in with the party power structure to be able to survive. They value party seniority and influence over the ability to affect change as an individual. And you see the power of MAGA being able to effectively overrun governmental systems because the party controls all branches.",Mend1cant,2025-05-03T10:10:31,20

"The US uses a system from the 18th century, and gives the upper house of the legislature (Senate) actual power that other democracies have stripped from their House of Lords.   I do dislike how parliaments lack the prestige a Presidential system has. For instance, in the UK, the PM left his townhouse they get a few days after the election. And there’s the fact that the Cabinet members have to remain MP, so they still have to represent some little district while doing their real job. It’d be like the Speaker of House in the US also being President and then choosing another Rep to be Sec of Defense, Education, etc. I think that limits options and is kind of stupid.   Then there’s the fact that most people don’t actually vote for the PM, so you might like the person running but have to vote in your own district for an MP you might personally despise. Then if that party doesn’t get a majority, they govern as a coalition which could end any day the party they partner with loses confidence, so you don’t have a full 4 years like the US President has to make things happen before the voters have a say.",Toadsrule84,2025-05-03T11:57:52,5

"Parliamentary systems are strictly better. Not perfect, but better.  Presidential systems inevitably trend towards autocracy.",ManBearScientist,2025-05-03T14:00:56,6
"Parliamentary systems are simply better. With the ongoing collapse of democracy and rule of law in the US, there are now 0 countries that have adopted a presidential system without facing a coup or self-coup by an incumbent president.  Presidential systems give lawmaking power to a decentralized, slow-moving body of hundreds of people and give the ability to enforce laws to a single, potentially erratic person who decides how said laws should be enacted. The problem is that if Congress passes a law saying that rooms in government buildings should be painted red, the President can order their subordinates to paint the buildings blue or risk being terminated. If Congress doesn’t have the ability to physically restrict executive branch employees from buying blue paint for the new buildings, the executive branch effectively controls all the power of government since neither the legislature nor the courts can overturn their decisions in practice.  The only way to reign in an out-of-control executive is to either reduce their ability to hire & fire government employees, make it easy for the legislature to remove the chief executive, or have the military/ outside groups remove them by force. The first two categorically violate what defines a presidential system (elected head of government elected by and not readily removable by the legislature), and the last option is a violation of democracy itself.  Parliamentary systems, especially in systems with frequent coalitions, are the only democratic systems that reliably keep the behavior and powers of the executive branch in check. Without said checks, populist executives become willing and able to take progress made on human rights and instititional development over the span of decades and burn it to the ground in just a few years.  TLDR: Presidential systems are more vulnerable to the “no one will stop me” loophole than parliamentary systems. Presidential systems make it easier to govern if you’re corrupt & autocratic, parliamentary systems make it easier to govern if you follow the rules.",GoldenInfrared,2025-05-03T22:56:37,5
"If there is anything to be learned from systems that flirt with or descend into authoritarianism, it's for the need to maintain robust checks and balances.  The US system is clearly exposing its weaknesses as we speak.  But so did Weimar Germany, which had a parliamentary system that proved to be even easier to topple.  The presidential system would be fine if the checks and balances were more effective.  The problem here is that the majority party in Congress is unwilling to constrain a president when the president is a member of their party.  This is made worse by the two-party system, as the intra-party coalition on the GOP side is more unified than a conservative-led coalition might be in a multi-party parliamentary coalition.  The US has been tumultuous from the start and there are no easy answers for dealing with its problems.",I405CA,2025-05-03T11:49:28,5
"I despise Presidential systems. I think that they prove to be indecisive, messy, and give a larger illusion of choice than actual choice.  Parliamentary systems, especially those that don't model themselves on the moranic UK system, lives in the spirit of the people coming together and making decisions. If it is Proportional, it can truly represent the will of the people. Sure sometimes it is hard for a government to form but if a nation is that broken, so be it.

"Parliamentary system hands down. [Here's my shameless proposal of how the US could adopt a parliamentary system at a state by state basis. ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IQO_KBrTY9Xs54nLnxn5iX3FRWskIGtH4fL9t99wZKU/edit?usp=sharing)  Parliaments get the benefit of being able to remove bad leaders, while still functioning as a government during interims. But I think the biggest benefit is their party ballots, which allows people to vote more accurately aligned with their wants, and small third parties have more proportional power since they hold the keys to forming coalitions. Unlike in the US, smaller Caucuses work within the two parties to get their agendas pushed, but are always secondary to the main staples of the party with little say in what's prioritized. Which makes Americans vote for parties they don't normally align with, solely to support a handful of policies that often aren't in the forefront (I.E. Environment/Gun Activists).  US parties don't really change until decades of inadequacy are shown, which I believe is happening right now. Parliaments let representation be more dynamic and fluid with changing times, rather than bloated from alliances that were made decades ago.  The only thing that I think would be better is Parliament + Approval voting (or any preferential ballot system). Because [First Past the Post](http://reddit.com/r/EndFPTP) is notorious for creating dishonest voting habits, and unnecessary election strategizing.  *That being said,* I like France's Semi-presidential system the most. The President is mostly responsible for foreign policy and ceremonial roles, while the Parliament's Prime Minister is more responsible for domestic finance affairs. For the US the roles would be better reversed. I think it would make sense if we had a Prime Minister [(or Secretary of State Chosen by Congress) ](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17GGzn3Ic2T5QH2oGekRmcMvFPrbkAmCFCh3aHN38gaU/edit?usp=sharing)to be in charge of foreign policy, and the President be in charge of domestic policy. Because most Americans don't care about foreign policy and vote based on domestic affairs. So it makes more sense to let foreign ministers be meritocratically chosen by Congress instead of tying it to the presidency.",illegalmorality,2025-05-07T03:33:29,2

From 1337 to 1487 England was embittered in wars over claims to thrones (Edward III's to Frances, and the War of Roses over England's).  Nothing can be less stable than a system whose sole resolution for the inevitable conflicts is violence.",ManBearScientist,2025-05-03T14:23:16,2

After elections, the previous government continues in a caretaker capacity until a new coalition is agreed (this is how it works in many parliamentary systems).

The new parliament takes office right away after elections, however, and acts as a check on the caretaker government. Having such a government is far less impactful to the functioning of government than for instance a ""government shutdown"" in the US.

"There's an important difference between those 2 countries that goes to explain why one failed when the other succeeded.  Japan is an island nation that has a shared cultural and national identity and has had one for hundreds of years, since at least the Tokogawa Shogunate in 1573.  When a parliamentary government was put in place, its members all saw themselves as Japanese and were easily able to work together to make decisions that benefited the entire country.   By contrast, Iraq as a country has only existed since the end of World War I.  It was created by a bunch of European countries negotiating with each other and creating arbitrary borders, with almost no regard for the people living there or their cultures.  It consolidated numerous ethnic, religious, and cultural groups into one nation that often didn't get along or, in some cases, had hated each other for generations.  Decades later, when the US instituted a parliamentary government, those issues had still never been resolved.  If anything, the animosity between tribes and cultures had only grown worse under Saddam as he targeted some of them with violence and persecution.  As a result, the parliamentary government consisted of a number of tribes that sought to consolidate their own power while hindering their enemies.  There is no strong sense of unity and nationalism like there is in Japan.    Instead, there are numerous factions all looking out for their best interests, often at the expense of the nation.    I think it's important to look at the reasons something fails when others succeed.

But if you pay attention to international news, you will know what their president just recently did and the reaction it caused.   These sorts of political figures with reckless disregard for the public or the office they hold come about far less often in parliamentary systems by virtue of how power is not rooted in one individual but in an entire body of individuals. For the US specifically, checks and balances do exist, but when the legislative and/or judicial branches don't care to act as a check on the president, then what we're left with is just an all-powerful president who doesn't fear consequences for his actions.   Compare that to parliamentary systems where the prime minister is always accountable to the legislature and their power can be revoked at any time through a simple majority vote when they do something as low-stakes as support an unpopular policy or their party loses their legislative majority status. It severely limits the likelihood of what we've seen happening in the US and South Korea where the removal process is long, arduous, difficult, and uncommon, and presidents can thus act in a way that is unbefitting of the office with far less concern for potential consequences.",lionhearted318,2025-05-04T08:22:21,4

"I'm still not sure I see it as a Parliamentary system fault though, more an issue with a (this?) referendum. We also had to craft a brexit bill, get it passed in two houses and had various battles in the courts. That took many years, votes, multiple political resignations and many unprecedented actions. The system bucked against it almost all the way, it really only succeeded because ""the people voted for brexit"" rather shut down any argument to stop it (reguardless of the vaugeness of what people actually voted for).  I would say Trump right now with his seeming unlimited control over both houses and lack of any enforcement by the courts is able to do the same right now but even more so.  In fact if you view brexit as 'damaging trade with your biggest trade partners', 'destroying relationships and easy movement with your nearest neighbours' and 'focusing obsessively on immigration' above other concerns, Trump has basically done it already.   Brexit took us four years, two Prime ministers, two general elections, multiple bills and endless debate. And we (nominally) voted for it specfically.  Trump's done much of the same in just 100 days, with a far less explict mandate.",hennell,2025-05-04T16:09:00,1

"I don't wanna wave away South Korea, but man, everything that happened there was just mind-numbingly stupid. It's obviously possible because it happened, but I think that's just an edge case that we (probably?) don't have to worry about. Even so, yes, I take your point that it showed the weakness of a presidential system. But even though Yoon stayed in power for months after the attempted self-coup, he was effectively neutered the night it happened. The removal process was indeed long, arduous, and difficult, but it happened, and the writing was on the wall long before his final removal last month.  On the other hand, parliamentary democracies have their own flaws. I'll refrain from bringing Hitler up again, but what do you do when the electorate is so divided that no one can form a coalition, let alone get a majority? Starmer has been in power less than a year, so there's a ways to go yet, but if an election were held today, it'd result in a hung parliament without any realistic coalitions (unless the Tories want to commit political suicide by being junior partners in a Farage-led government). There's relatively few examples of this, but when the established parties can't work things out, it's the radicals that take advantage of it. Pasokificiation on the left, ""Faragism"" (for the lack of a better term) on the right. And this is exactly the kind of thing that leads to people like Farage, who think they know better, who think they shouldn't be beholden to traditional democratic norms, who have a cult of personality, etc. So at the end of the day, what's the difference?",AT_Dande,2025-05-04T16:36:11,0

">But even though Yoon stayed in power for months after the attempted self-coup, he was effectively neutered the night it happened. The removal process was indeed long, arduous, and difficult, but it happened, and the writing was on the wall long before his final removal last month.  It did, but even then there was still a question over whether it would happen because of how difficult presidential systems make the removal process. The first attempt to impeach Yoon failed because his party boycott the vote, while the second attempt was just barely successful thanks to a handful of rebels from Yoon's party to clear the two-thirds majority requirement. What helps South Korea though, is that judges, not legislators, decide whether to remove an impeached president from office, which (at least in theory) can keep the process less politicized and more objective if it does manage to clear the initial two-thirds majority requirement.   As it stands in the US, I struggle to see the same situation shaking out the same way given our impeachment rules. The two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict and remove is a high bar to clear and I don't really have faith that senators would put the good of the country over their loyalty to their party in today's day and age. Sure, in theory, if the entire country turned against the president and unanimously was begging for his removal from office, that'd be one thing, but given American political polarization, I don't necessarily see that happening in our current age, and I don't think enough senators would turn against their own party and vote to convict absent of that.  >I'll refrain from bringing Hitler up again, but what do you do when the electorate is so divided that no one can form a coalition, let alone get a majority?  This is true and is of course a negative point of parliamentary democracies, but I would also argue that this is just a flaw of multi-party democracies in general and not inherent to parliamentary systems. If the US became a parliamentary democracy overnight but did not change anything else, it'd still be a battle between the Republicans and Democrats with the odds of neither party reaching a majority being nearly-impossible. Having a parliamentary system would not inherently make it easier for parties outside of the Democrat/Republican binary to be elected to the House or the Senate, unless we completely overhauled the way we conduct our federal elections as well.  There are many examples of two-party-dominant parliamentary systems where achieving a coalition that can govern is not a real worry (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, etc.), and the UK was in the same boat until Farage's rise to power within the last election cycle.   But with all that being said, parliamentary systems are based on consensus and compromise. When there is an election that leads to a hung parliament and no obvious potential coalition, things still end up working themselves out. This happened in the last Dutch election, and after negotiations, four right-wing political parties agreed to form a majority coalition led by an independent prime minister. When Austria's government fell amidst controversy in 2019, the Austrian head of state appointed an independent prime minister to take over with a non-partisan technocratic government until new elections could be held.  The point is that, there are flaws no matter what system you adopt, because if there was a perfect system there'd be no need for debate. But I think the flaws to parliamentary systems are the most easily worked-through, and not only that, but I think that growing up in a parliamentary system of government breeds a form of political thinking in its population that is less adversarial and more compromise-based which is beneficial. I think that these flaws to a parliamentary system really pale in comparison to the flaws of a presidential system, which seem to only be solved with a ""just trust that the other branches of government will do their jobs.""",lionhearted318,2025-05-04T17:19:38,2
"I'll agree with this bit: > The point is that, there are flaws no matter what system you adopt, because if there was a perfect system there'd be no need for debate.  We could probably argue the rest of your post for hours on end, but I think it'd mostly be nitpicking.  What I will say is that the US is fairly unique because of its long democratic tradition *and* the electoral system, not just by virtue (or lack thereof) of its form of government. We've only had four impeachments in our history, with the last two being bipartisan. I can't argue a hypothetical, but there's an alternate dimension where McConnell gives the green light to the dozen or so hold-outs who ultimately voted to acquit Trump as McCarthy is excoriating him on the House floor (funny how that turned out for them). One could also argue that Nixon's resignation preempted conviction and removal by the Senate. Would I bet that a sitting President would get impeached and removed in our lifetime? Absolutely not. But as you said, it's a solid maybe, right?  The biggest issue America is facing now isn't the fundamental flaws brought about by the presidential system, but rather the fact that the other two branches have been asleep at the wheel for the past two decades, if not longer.",AT_Dande,2025-05-05T07:54:36,1
