"There was a time when all presidents, regardless of party, recognized the importance of democracy. We believe that all human beings deserve the right to self-determination, and if a country that wasnâ€™t extending that to its citizens it was transgressing that right. We supported democracy around the world, because it was morally the right thing to do, economically the right thing to do, and also made the world safer. Trump, unfortunately, does not seem to view democracy as one of our strengths, more like hindrance to his efforts to control our country. He has extended that disdain for democracy to the rest of the world, including the Ukraine. Beyond the tactical advantages of having the Ukraine, bleed Russia, there is also a moral obligation to support democracies wherever they are",Blake_Ashby,2025-05-07T08:27:26,4
"""Impassioned defense of his record on the economy"" should have been impassioned offense for 4 years.",MessagingMatters,2025-05-08T11:01:17,1
"I love Biden generally speaking and I agree that appeasing Putin was incredibly stupid for Trump to do but... Biden really has no room to talk here. He spent 4 years trying to appease the Republican party and despite having the power even before the immunity instead of getting Trump rightfully and legally jailed he held off under the guise of ""fairness.""       Trump not the only one who tried to reach across the aisle to appease someone who he should be treating as the opposition (at best) that needs to be stopped.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-07T18:11:02,1
"We got complacent and believed that since we believed in the importance of democracy, everybody else does too. That's why the ""unwritten rules and laws"" were never actually written so that they could actually be used to stop the kind of behavior we're seeing now. The only thing keeping our rights intact has always been the idea that everybody else wants to keep our rights intact. A Trump was inevitable since we never put anything in to stop a Trump from happening.  We were also fooled into believing that the Republican party ever actually believed in the importance of democracy and freedom. Trump merely took the already tissue paper thing veil off and showed the world that no, the Republicans have never believed in freedom, only in money and power.",immortalfrieza2,2025-05-07T17:55:32,2
