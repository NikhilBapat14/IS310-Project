There’s no mechanism for The People to unseat a Senator with brain damage. Everyone around him needs to convince him to step down.,Ordinary-Leading7405,2025-05-09T07:44:59,72

I wonder how much different he would be if he didn’t have the stroke. Did he have completely different views before and was just hiding them or did the stroke change him that much?,Viral_Poster,2025-05-09T22:29:30,1

We have a president who appears to be in mental decline and spouting incoherent sentences every time he gives an interview. I think the least of our concerns is Fetterman.,Financial-Special766,2025-05-09T08:04:07,-4
I'm willing to hold Fetterman to whatever metric of mental competence the GOP is willing to hold Trump to.,thepartypantser,2025-05-09T07:56:49,-3

">What does an unstable senator or seven matter  He voted for cloture on the GOP spending bill, he capes for Trump and rightwing media darlings, and he's a physical danger to himself and people around him, he's already gotten in one car wreck that injured his wife's spine and he refused to put on a seatbelt on a commercial flight.",PeliPal,2025-05-09T11:33:03,6
I'm more worried for his family. He apparently got in a gnarly car crash with his wife in the car. He seems unstable but also wholly unaware he's unstable.,BaaBaaTurtle,2025-05-09T09:15:19,9

"I didn’t vote for them, they’re not dems and I don’t expect republicans to do anything good for anyone but themselves. Fetterman should step down and Shapiro will name a replacement.   Why should that not happen?

"Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) said on Monday that President Trump was “kind” and “cordial” at a Mar-a-Lago meeting that sparked scrutiny about the Democratic senator’s approach to the new administration.  “Overall, it was a positive experience. I mean, he was kind, he was cordial. It wasn’t in any kind of theater. It wasn’t trying to get your picture taken to kind of put something out on social media. It was just, really, a conversation. We actually spoke for over an hour,” Fetterman told “The View.”  Fetterman met with Trump at his Palm Beach resort earlier this month, ahead of the inauguration, and Trump left with praise for the Pennsylvania senator.   “He’s a commonsense person. He’s not liberal or conservative. He’s just a commonsense person, which is beautiful,” Trump said in an interview with the Washington Examiner.",PeliPal,2025-05-09T10:55:37,2

"It wasn’t a light switch-type of change. It was a gradual change of character, due to the stroke suffered during the campaign. Over the years he has grown more aggressive, etc., and is in denial that anything is wrong. It’s not that he changed his ideologies, it’s that people who work with him are feeling less and less safe around him…",StrGze32,2025-05-09T08:40:03,11

"The amount of centrists and Israel first supporters trying to defend Fetterman is comical. He resigns and Shapiro replaces him, PA gets a senator that actually represent who what they voted for the only loser in that situation are zionists and republicans who lose a sympathetic vote in Fetterman.",cathercules,2025-05-09T11:40:47,7

"Mate, that's not how it works. My mother is a nurse who worked with alot of patients like Fetterman. It's a slow decline that happens over time. You don't get an instant personality makeover.  To those suffering they are unaware there's been a change. Many of them do think everything is fine. Did you not read about his outburst? That is clear sign of of what brain damage can look like. By all accounts Fetterman does think he's fine. It just everyone that's a problem.  You didn't get duped, you got a man who had a stroke and has rejected help which is only going to aid in making things worse. It's a challenge trying to get someone like Fetterman help, and is only to gradually get worse over time the longer he rejects help.",Defiant-Grapefruit23,2025-05-09T09:11:51,5
