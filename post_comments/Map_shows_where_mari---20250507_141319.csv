"PA absolutely should legalize it.  You can basically go to OH, NY, NJ, or MD to get it..... we are missing on tax revenue, and MAYBE we can lower our stupid states fuel tax, and bring gas down too!!!",Beneficial-Finger353,2025-05-07T14:20:41,9
Congratulations Pennsylvania you're going to need it to deal with the anxiety now. ,arilupe,2025-05-07T14:20:56,5
"They probably will legalize it.  Huge tax revenues.    I will say as someone living where it's legal:   work needs to be done to address DUI and public use.    People are doing stupid stuff.   Their defense is that they can do whatever they want because ""pot use is legal"".",ProtozoaPatriot,2025-05-07T15:54:55,3
So stupid it’s not federally legal,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-07T15:06:50,5
Unfortunately we've got a 27-23 republican controlled senate. So its gonna get shot down.,Most-Detective-188,2025-05-07T15:00:08,2
Looking at states with legal and easy access to this hallucinogen explains why democrats have gone so far off the rails in the past 10 years.,box-cable,2025-05-07T14:21:36,-32
I see so many PA tags in the parking lots at NJ dispensaries. There’s probably at least 20 dispensaries within 20 minutes from the Philly bridges.,InevitableRemix,2025-05-07T15:18:21,5
"I'd be cautious in Ohio. Police will still pull you over and give you shit for it if it's in the car, as well as still trying to use the ""smell"" as an excuse to do an illegal search.",old-world-reds,2025-05-07T15:27:47,2
Every state needs to legalize it. Especially all of the red states since the blue states carry them,finitefuck,2025-05-07T23:39:15,1
"Honestly have trouble believing you're even an american, cannabis has become so wildly popular and culturally pervasive across the aisle and most ""medical"" states will just give you a card for the most benign shit you could think of. Just a reminder Joe Rogan is also a pothead and the first man Elon also smoked weed on his podcast. Acting like its a democrat thing at this point kind of gives away if you're an american or not imo at this point in time. Like 70% of all americans support legalization and the support for medical is even higher close to 80%. There is a reason why even republicans in congress don't wanna touch restarting the drug war with a ten foot pole, when was the last time you heard Trump say it should be illegal again?",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-07T14:39:42,11
"Honestly, you should try an edible. You might find yourself being less angry about everything.",Motodoso,2025-05-07T14:46:20,6
"Wahhh, the nanny state needs to protect citizens from what they choose to do.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-07T14:44:44,5
Look at the old reefer madness believing fool. Tell me why all those anti marijuana red states are all in shambles.,OhAndItsShavedd,2025-05-07T15:03:22,4
Now do alcohol and republicans  Also when is the last time someone hallucinated from weed?,rottenavocadotoast,2025-05-07T15:07:12,2
"You can find it anywhere, legal or not, and people from either side of the aisle are smoking it, legal or not. There are plenty of republican voters that use cannabis--I mean, doesn't Roger Stone have the world's largest Nixon bong collection?",ye_olde_green_eyes,2025-05-07T16:58:48,1
What a silly and misinformed opinion.,NineBloodyFingers,2025-05-07T14:46:13,1

"Hardly even California at this point, I even had an interview for an extraction supervisor in Florida not even a month ago, pretty much every rec state allows just 21 and over sales don't even need an in-state ID, Hawaii and a few states reciprocate medical cards now as well. I'm not that partial to where I live, but it was good pay in gator country so I could afford a house. I moved to California a decade ago to gain experience in cannabis and now a lot of jobs are opening up back on the east coast with better pay (don't try it now in California, market is saturated and over producing as fuck, rough times ahead here if you're in industry).",SPACE_ICE,2025-05-07T14:54:56,1
all intoxicants should be banned.,box-cable,2025-05-07T15:48:10,-3
