"I've notice the term ""dismissed"" is being used by ALL the MSM (and NPR even) in place of ""fired"". Is this part of the sane washing media is required to perform now?",williamgman,2025-04-29T19:00:39,7
">The Trump Administration has dismissed the scientists working on the country's flagship climate report, a move that threatens to curtail climate science and make information about global warming less available to the public.  >The National Climate Assessment is the most trustworthy and comprehensive source of information about how global warming affects the United States. It answers common questions about how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities, how much rain is normal for different regions and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure.  >The assessment is mandated by Congress, and its sixth edition was supposed to be released in late 2027. About 400 volunteer authors had already started work. They included top scientists as well as economists, tribal leaders and climate experts from non-profit groups and corporations.",fungobat,2025-04-29T19:59:58,3

"Well technically authors/contributors to the NCA don't get paid, so it's not necessarily appropriate to say ""fired"". This is a travesty nonetheless",neazwaflcasd,2025-04-29T20:02:21,1
