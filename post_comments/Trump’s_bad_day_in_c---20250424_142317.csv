Or think about what would have happened if she had instead been the judge in Trump‚Äôs hush money case in NY, and how differently that would have played out.  Courts may not always be able to compel the Trump administration to do something, but they could prevent it from receiving the rulings it wants that would allow it to more fully implement its agenda.  For example, they could end up keeping Harvard‚Äôs tax exempt status intact and deprive Trump of the ruling he would need to force them to pay taxes.

"Contempt charges for the DoJ personnel relevant to each case.  He'll pardon them, or let them twist in the wind, but they can't stand before those judges again.  Trump will have to bring in new attorneys, likely tell them to stall like the last ones did, judges will hold *them* in contempt.  Within a few weeks, he'll either be down to inexperienced, barely competent lawyers, or no-one at all.  Attorneys can also be disbarred if their actions are shown to be incompetent, malicious, etc,  That would cost them their careers, so anyone who agrees to work with Trump will be very careful to avoid that outcome.  Lastly, even if the U.S. Marshalls refuse to do their duty as enforcement for the courts, the Supreme Court can deputize any person or persons they wish to carry out their orders.  Issue warrants, make arrests, take people into custody, hold them in an appropriate facility.  And those deputies would answer solely to the courts.  Trump could issue one of his little Executive Orders for them to be fired and it would have no merit, no teeth.  Congress can't touch them, either.

"  Wow, OK.  I see now I should have asked if that was a legitimate question intended to gain knowledge about a subject or an attempt to prove some preconceived notion you have about the limitations of US courts‚Äô power.  It certainly didn‚Äôt deserve a good faith effort on my part to further illustrate my point, since you were only interested in confirming your opinion that the courts are powerless to do anything to stop the Trump administration in every situation ever.  With all due respect, do you know much about the U.S. judicial system and how it works?  Any experience in that system?  I didn‚Äôt realize the point of your question was to challenge the very notion that the courts have any power at all to curtail the president‚Äôs agenda.  These black and white, all or nothing hot takes on a legal system people don‚Äôt know much about aside from what they read in the news get old fast.  I hate to be the first to inform you, but Trump‚Äôs little cat and mouse game with the courts on the subject of returning Abrego Garcia from El Salvador is not the proof positive you think it is that the courts are completely powerless to halt the administration in its tracks in every matter that comes before them.  You completely misunderstood what I said about Cannon.  I used Cannon as an example to illustrate how much a judge can alter the usual path a court case should take.  Not as an example of how a judge has defied Trump‚Äôs will in the past.  A case like Jack Smith‚Äôs prosecution should have, and rightfully would have, gone to trial.  Except, her bias toward Trump led to her dismissing the case. What if the opposite were to happen when Trump tries to prosecute someone, say, from Biden‚Äôs administration?  How far will Trump get when a judge who doesn‚Äôt care for his DOJ‚Äôs bad faith arguments ends up hearing the case?  What I said is that judges have a tremendous amount of power in their courtrooms.  An otherwise legitimate case could get tossed out, or an illegitimate prosecution that should be dismissed could be allowed to continue.  Appeals, and efforts to remove judges, could take years and prove fruitless.  Judges can make life miserable for attorneys.  They can make cases harder to win for Trump‚Äôs DOJ.  They can ultimately deliver rulings that thwart Trump‚Äôs will at trial and prove difficult to reverse on appeal.  A judge who is reluctant to believe a single word out of Trump‚Äôs DOJ could potentially find numerous legal or evidentiary reasons to dismiss charges and thwart Trump‚Äôs will.  Or maybe just disallow key pieces of evidence and make it harder to obtain a conviction.    There are hundreds of examples I could give you in which courts could prevent Trump from enforcing his will.  Trump‚Äôs efforts to trustbust his corporate enemies could result in his FTC being laughed out of court.  Emergency use of tariffs by executive fiat could be voided and result in the inability to collect tariffs at borders due to a lack of enforcement mechanisms to hold violators accountable in the U.S. Court of International Trade.  Efforts to award his real estate buddies no bid contracts to develop energy on federal lands could be cancelled and result in title disputes and litigation that would leave those businesses in legal limbo and subject them to liability if found to be in defiance of court order.  Think of any time the Trump administration tries to collect a tax, levy a fee, impose a requirement, charge someone with a violation of federal law, or selectively target an opponent through an administrative agency.  All of these situations - and more - could prove problematic for a DOJ lacking credibility.   But I noticed you ignored my example about his challenge to Harvard‚Äôs tax-exempt status.  Harvard could end up winning that case, especially if 1) Trump‚Äôs DOJ loses credibility in the eyes of the court and 2) the court ends up disbelieving the administration‚Äôs arguments because they believe its justification for revoking Harvard‚Äôs tax exempt status is pretextual, i.e. arbitrary and capricious per the APA. In that case, the court could literally ‚Äúcompel‚Äù the Trump administration NOT to hit Harvard with a tax bill.  Because they have no authority to do so.  And if they try to, Harvard can simply ignore it.  And any prosecution for dodging some unlawful tax bill would be dismissed by the courts because Trump‚Äôs IRS was deemed previously to have no authority to tax Trump.  The courts serve more functions than just twisting the administration‚Äôs arm in order to get them to do so something they‚Äôre refusing to do.  They provide the legal basis upon which the administration can compel action against people and entities in the first place.  If a court finds there‚Äôs no legal basis to collect a *tax* from Harvard, good luck collecting a tax from Harvard. Do you see what I mean?  It could indeed be difficult to compel the administration to release grant funding being withheld, or to prevent them from impounding congressionally earmarked funding. But the courts can deprive them of authority for their agencies to take a wide, wide range of actions against others, because those actions will have no teeth unless appropriately enforced by a court.  Like I said, if Trump wants to start seizing Harvard‚Äôs endowment and raiding their bank accounts to obtain tax money pursuant to a tax-exempt status revocation by his IRS that was already invalidated by a court, then now we‚Äôre just in straight up dictator-land and rules mean nothing anymore anyway.  Maybe we‚Äôll get to that point, but until then, courts could very well put a stop to him revoking Harvard‚Äôs exemption.  Honestly, comments like yours remind me why I shouldn‚Äôt even bother trying to share any insight on Reddit I‚Äôve gained from 10+ years practicing law in state and federal courts and two judicial clerkships.

"Not completely.  The DC association could refuse to disbar, but the ABA has rules that most states (and DC) abide by, and if the attorneys are members, the DC bar's refusal won't carry much weight.

Moreover, if an attorney is disbarred *anywhere*, most states/regions/associations will honor that and enforce it, so the DC bar refusing would really only mean the attorneys would likely never be able to work anywhere *except* in DC, and no firm's going to hire someone who's been disbarred everywhere else, so that only leaves the DoJ... who they failed.  They'll end up shuffling papers or unemployed, most likely, even if the Bondi bro tries to protect them.  Disbarment really isn't something to screw around with.

"The Senate requires a two-thirds majority vote, not just a majority.  By the way, all members participate in an impeachment trial.  \-----President Trump's Results of previous impeachment trials-----  1. **2019 Impeachment Trial**: In the House, Trump was impeached on charges of ""abuse of power"" and ""obstruction of Congress,"" but in the Senate, the votes for conviction did not reach the required two-thirds majority, resulting in acquittal. 2. **2021 Impeachment Trial**: In the House, Trump was impeached for ""incitement of insurrection."" In the Senate, there were 57 votes for conviction and 43 votes against, but this also fell short of the two-thirds majority needed, leading to acquittal.",EntertainmentFast998,2025-04-25T05:26:40,2

"We **are** in a full-on fascist state, but it's still being consolidated. January 20, 2025 is equivalent to January 30 1933. It took Hitler a year to fully consolidate his power in the German government. Trump is in the same process so many Americans won't realize how fascist things are for a few more months.   So when you use phrases like ""I guess"" you're probably doing the same thing that many Germans were doing in the late spring and early summer of 1933, when they just couldn't believe what was happening.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-24T19:07:10,8

"Some.  Not all, and not even the best.  Harvard told Trump to gargle their balls.  Numerous firms are standing up to him, his extortion attempts have already generated lawsuits and a lot of attorneys are foaming at the mouth to join the fight.  He really fucked up when he attacked Harvard, though.  They're going to eat him alive.",LuminaraCoH,2025-04-25T06:28:49,3
