"Thank you. I thought I'd been shadowbanned from posting in this sub because everytime I posted, my comment would show up for me but when I logged out they'd be gone. All other subs they worked just fine. Your comment got me thinking that perhaps it was more to do with me using some sort of wrongspeak.",FirefighterFast6492,2025-04-26T05:35:09,5
