She is on her third marriage.  Apparently she didn’t submit hard enough.  And she kept the last name “White.”  A real paragon of conservative “Christian “ values.,Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-27T13:46:27,174
">*“Because God has an order,” she said. “Look, the head of my household is my husband, Jonathan Cain. Period.”*  How come your name is Paula White then?",fxkatt,2025-04-27T14:13:33,32
">Paula White, the televangelist who was appointed head of the White House Faith Office in the current administration, has a message for women: you must “submit” to men.  >She said that she is working for the president, who she claims has “been in ministry for 40 years and understands it.”  >“Because God has an order,” she said. “Look, the head of my household is my husband, Jonathan Cain. Period.”  >“We have a loving, amazing relationship. But if there’s ever a time that a decision has to be made and we don’t agree on something, he’s the head,” she said. “It’s not hard to submit.”  Weirdly, I thought the Bible said it would be better to never marry whatsoever. Matthew 19 and 1 Corinthians 7 says that it's better to be basically asexual than marry.    Yet, Paula White is advocating for men to come back and forcefully make women submit to them, instead of saying for everyone to stay single, like the Bible states.     This is another reason why I left the church entirely. When I found out I'm aromantic asexual, I found the true me, and I could not be happier. Living under that purity culture umbrella that basically tries to cajole and harangue everyone into being married (as if you have no choice but to) was a nightmare.     I'll gladly live and die single than be married to someone. I'm just not interested in being some ""priest of the home"" and treating some woman as ""some Instagram tradwife helpmeet"". That sounds horrific to me.",southpawFA,2025-04-27T13:33:14,35
"I was born and raised in Southern California but found myself living in Kansas City at some point where I was invited to attend a young adult mixer at IHOP in 2009 (not the restaurant).  I don't know why I went.  Morbid curiousity.  It was the first time in my life that I had met girls that were stridently anti-feminist.  I thought it was a joke at first when in conversation one of the young ladies stated that she hoped her husband would allow her to finish college and become a teacher but if he didn't want that she would be ok just teaching Sunday school.    At the time, I thought this had to be a fringe minority opinion that would never catch on.  Seems I was wrong.",Weary-Lime,2025-04-27T13:44:20,13

"Casually ignoring that the ""submission"" referred to in Christian marriage is supposed to be equitably in both directions, as two people are functioning as one. To ""submit"" is to give up much of the power of being independent in order to join a partnership. Labeling it as wives submitting to their husbands is not only against doctrine, it makes zero sense in the context of what Jesus was saying.    Jesus appeared to the women first after the resurrection and they were the ones who first spread the good news, even though in first century Jerusalem the testimony of a woman would have been considered lesser. This continued misogyny is one of the Church's oldest sins, right down to denying them an equal spot in clergy. Jesus literally said God doesn't see a difference between men and women, yet so much of the faithful has selective hearing on the subject.",Bigweld_Ind,2025-04-27T13:40:02,21

">“Because God has an order,” she said. “Look, the head of my household is my husband, Jonathan Cain. Period.” “ ... if there’s ever a time that a decision has to be made and we don’t agree on something, he’s the head,” she said. “It’s not hard to submit.”  -- Paula White  If Paula White-Cain feels spiritually fulfilled by “submitting” to her husband, that’s between her, her pastor, and maybe a therapist. But public officials don’t get to turn their private religious hobbies into national policy. That’s not “faith”; it’s a First Amendment violation.  Trump's EO's creating a ""Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias"" sounds less like a real government office and more like a dystopian fanfic where theocrats can’t handle being disagreed with. Definitely nothing authoritarian about using state power to prop up your favorite religion — unless you count *every theocracy in history.*  The First Amendment is clear: no government religion, no favoritism. Yet somehow building a federal “Faith Office” - no less with a tele-evangelist grifter leading it - to boost Christianity barely makes these self-proclaimed ""constitutional conservatives"" blink.  This is just the latest in Trump’s - and the Republicans Project 2025 - entire playbook — test the limits of executive power, blow past them, and dare anyone to stop him. Courts have slapped down some of it, but way too much has stuck and is doing major harm to the nation – some of it maybe irreparable.    Trump's latest EOs lunacy is just more foreshadowing of even worse constitutional wreckage that lies ahead, i.e., Trump dutifully fulfilling the Republicans Project 2025 agenda. And it's not even been the first 100 days yet - although it certainly feels more like it's been 100 years of this Trump-MAGA Republican nightmare regime.",haiku2572,2025-04-27T13:55:22,9

"The *sole* value of conservatism is respect for and obedience to \[one's perception of\] traditionally established hierarchy, and hierarchy dictates that those on top (in-groups) are rightfully idolized and receive privileges, credibility, and resources, while those on the bottom (out-groups) are demonized/dehumanized and bound by restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources.  To them, the second-greatest injustice imaginable is for those \[they perceive to be\] on the bottom \[of social hierarchy\] to have access to the rights, credibility, and resources reserved for those on top. The first greatest injustice is for those on top to be bound by the restrictions, scrutiny, and lack of resources reserved for those on the bottom.
