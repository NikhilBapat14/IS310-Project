"I’m beyond tired of watching politicians weaponize the Constitution like it’s a prop for whatever outrage du jour they’re selling. They scream about the Second Amendment like it’s holy scripture, but trample voting rights, ignore due process, and gut equal protection with a straight face. The hypocrisy isn’t just blatant, it’s dangerous.",watchTheWorldBurn247,2025-05-09T10:50:30,15

For our clients, New York’s licensing regime renders the Second Amendment a legal fiction. Worse, virtually all our clients whom New York prosecutes for exercising their Second Amendment right are Black or Hispanic. And that is no accident. *New York enacted its firearm licensing requirements to criminalize gun ownership by racial and ethnic minorities.* That remains the effect of its enforcement by police and prosecutors today.",FreeGrabberNeckties,2025-05-09T12:32:39,1
