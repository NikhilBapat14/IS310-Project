"Good news, but it doesn't mean a thing until the deals are actually negotiated. One hopes his trade-pact negotiating team is up for the Herculean task of negotiating so many different deals with so many different countries....all over a relatively short period of time. Our negotiating partners are tuned in on making a deal with one specific country (USA)....while OUR negotiators are groping through negotiations with 130. Puts us at a distinct disadvantage....all Trump's doing.  My hope is that in a month's time, Trump can trumpet to the world (and to an innately hostile domestic media) that he's reached agreement with several key trading partners - e.g., UK, India, Vietnam, Isreal - with terms at least somewhat advantageous to the USA. Doing so will calm both the markets and the media hysteria....and then we can take our time dealing with rivals like China and the EU.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-13T14:32:58,45
