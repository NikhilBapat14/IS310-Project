Not surprised. Many articles on Wikipedia have been taken over by pro-Hamas activists. Pirate Wires did some excellent investigative journalism on this last year:  [How Wikipedia’s Pro-Hamas Editors Hijacked the Israel-Palestine Narrative](https://www.piratewires.com/p/how-wikipedia-s-pro-hamas-editors-hijacked-the-israel-palestine-narrative)  [Archive Link](https://archive.ph/ZqHRu),zip117,2025-04-14T10:36:06,48

These schools keep falling lower in the eyes of society. It boggles my mind that the administrators of these institutions don't see what's happening.   My respect for the grads of these schools has really diminished.,goober1157,2025-04-14T10:57:25,12
"Wikipedia isn’t considered scholarly for research purposes just like any other encyclopedia, because they are not primary sources of information.  At best, they give you enough to find primary sources.  Wikipedia, not so much - links are mostly to blogs and news articles.",j3remy2007,2025-04-14T11:31:04,18

Remind me please of how large Harvard's endowment fund is?,New_Ant_7190,2025-04-14T13:26:01,1
"Wikipedia intentionally favors secondary sources over primary sources. In practice, this means that while it is frowned upon to use first-hand accounts from people involved in an event, it is recommended to cite reporting on the same event from ""trusted sources"" (see: biased mainstream outlets). In other words, the bias is a feature rather than a bug. Combine this issue with ideologically motivated, largely full-time moderators and you get a site in which every page on a political topic sounds like it could've been written by the DNC and virtually every conservative political figure has a ""controversies"" section on their page. Wikipedia can still be useful for non-contentious subjects but it is thoroughly unreliable regarding political and religious topics.",gtam5,2025-04-14T13:12:32,10
