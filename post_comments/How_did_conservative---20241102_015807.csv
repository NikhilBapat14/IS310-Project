"They didn't.  Despite what Trump says, his actual record of Presidency is far from anti-war as he was extremely hawkish on Iran, nearly causing conflict, and escalated tensions with DPRK before things deescalated.  He was actually reigned in by his staff and other countries, notably Shinzo Abe, on his more hawkish ambitions.",Naliamegod,2024-11-03T10:57:28,2
"I remember a SNL skit from the Clinton years with Gingrich, Dole, etc dressed like hippies with signs protesting the Bosnia intervention. It's been going on for a long time - whatever Dems do, GOP is against and vice versa.",loweexclamationpoint,2024-11-07T13:30:55,1
"Key words... ""nearly causing conflict""  He didnt start any new wars... PERIOD. Nobody on the world stage takes Biden and Harris seriously.  Before he entered politics he was TOTALLY and 100% against the war in Iraq, this is well documented and can be found on google and youtube... try to seperate your dislike for him from the facts. He believes in peace through strength and sending in soldiers as a last resort.   No such thing as almost pregnant.",danbrooks3k,2024-11-04T04:21:22,2

What would you argue are the best ways to prevent military conflict?,Julius-Ra,2024-11-04T16:34:05,1
">He didnt start any new wars...  The last official war we were in was WWII. You likely mean military conflict, and that a questionable claim at best.  >Nobody on the world stage takes Biden and Harris seriously.  Got a source for that?  >Before he entered politics he was TOTALLY and 100% against the war in Iraq,  Trump, when asked if he supported invading Iraq in 2002 (before the invasion) states ""Yeah, I guess so."" That doesn't sound 100%  against the war. He came out against the war 2 years later, but so did a whole host of other people, hence Bush's wildly declining popularity during his tenure.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-04T10:14:19,2
He was a Democrat then. He hadnt became the stellar Christian yet ,Haunting_Part8120,2024-11-06T00:35:05,1
"It’s in reaction to our past 2 Democrat presidents, it’s created this perception of Republicans being the anti war party. Reading your question made me immediately think of Obamas record breaking arm dealings (this after being elected hugely on claims of a reversal of aggression under the Bush administration when in truth Obama adapted and expanded on these policies) and Biden’s funding of Ukraine and his unhinged warmongering rant calling for more war…I don’t have to say these two “almost” did anything. I’ve seen comments even reaching  claiming Trump did nothing to deter our current wars (on Reddit of course), maybe Trump being vehemently anti war will make it less taboo to be pro",afbabybluegirl,2025-02-18T13:19:38,1
">Got a source for that?  I'd just point to Russia invading Ukraine, China doing all the drills around Taiwan and their expansion in the South China sea, NK building bigger and bigger rockets (now they have one that can reach basically the entire US), the Houthi's, Iran and its proxies... none of that was happening under Trump.  >He came out against the war 2 years later, but so did a whole host of other people, hence Bush's wildly declining popularity during his tenure.  And I think this is the reason that so many Republicans have become anti-war: we saw hard evidence that after twenty years and trillions of dollars, we could not plant American/western liberal democracies there.  It entirely failed.  Sure, we can blow stuff up with relative ease, but actually doing the national building stuff that Bush thought was possible... nah, that's not going to work.  And that idea - nations are who they want to be and we can't change that - has started influencing their new takes on what is happening in the world.",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-08T10:02:48,1

And all of this was ramping up under Trump. Just because it continued escalating under Biden doesn't mean anything about respect, because it was building under Trump too.",ProLifePanda,2024-11-08T10:06:50,1
">And all of this was ramping up under Trump.  Sources?  Iran was mostly defanged and couldn't fund its proxies.  That's why Blinken made his comments just months before the Hamas attacks on Israel.  And I don't seem to recall Iran launching hundreds of missles before...  China around Taiwan - it was mostly threats.  Not literal live fire drills encircling the island.  North Korea - Trump *went* to North Korea during his term.  It was getting cooler, not warmer.  Houthi's - When did they start firing missiles at ships?",LordFoxbriar,2024-11-08T10:10:23,1
"This is silly. If you’re going to lie, you should make sure it’s not on something easily disproven by Google. No offense but you should know better than to think so black and white about all this.   There were rocket attacks by Iranian proxies on US soldiers in Iraq throughout Trump’s term. His pulling out of the Iran Deal has now brought Iran closer to a nuclear weapon than ever before. Nothing he did accomplished anything - Iran wasn’t “defanged,” instead they gained power throughout Iraq and Syria and the situation is worse off.  https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2021/9/9/trump-admin-sought-to-play-down-troop-injuries-in-iraq-official  China did indeed do live fire drills around Taiwan. They started under Trump, actually. Again, easily verifiable if you bothered to Google.  https://globaltaiwan.org/2024/10/chinas-military-exercises-around-taiwan-trends-and-patterns/  North Korea? You want to stick up for Trump on North Korea? That entire effort failed. He secured no agreements. DPRK demonstrated a missile that could hit the US homeland during Trump’s term and he never managed to deal with it - after his summit collapsed for lack of agreement North Korea was back to firing missiles over Japan and South Korea within a month.  https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-us-north-korea-talks-failed-again  The question is: why argue like this? You should know better that other countries don’t stop and start doing things solely based on which Party controls the US presidency. Of course everything under Biden has precedent under Trump, and then precedent under Obama. Unless someone is a rank partisan unable to assign any fault to their favored administration, there is no reason to NOT look up the extremely simple and accessible information I found above before lashing out at someone.",[deleted],2024-11-17T12:56:11,1
