Right, follow me here:  If vaccines really *don't work* as RFK Jr. claims, why would scientists go to the extremes of using something as supposedly ""sinister"" or ethically fraught as aborted fetal cells to *make them work*?  The implication is that vaccines require ""aborted fetus debris"" to function, but he has said numerous times that vaccines are ineffective or outright harmful.  So which is it? Either:  The fetal cell lines are essential to some scientific function -- which would verify vaccine efficacy **or** the cell lines are meaningless and just there for, who the fuck knows, shock value? To be evil? His own argument completely undercuts itself.  It's a classic tactic of pseudoscience conspiracy fearmongering. Make the claim as shocking as possible (""fetus debris!"") while also denying the very thing the claim relies on (that vaccines do anything beneficial.) It's designed to provoke fear and confusion, it's clickbait to the core.  This is all besides the fact that this brain-worm addled old fuck lacks a genuine understanding of how vaccines are made, what a ""fetal cell line"" is (they were harvested from aborted fetuses long ago, there is no need for actual ""aborted fetuses"" in vaccines, he may be getting his stem cell conspiracy mixed up) and most importantly how modern medicine evaluates safety and efficiency.  RFK Jr.'s head is so hollowed out from brain worms that when he hears this horsefuck antivax fetus debris bullshit echo'd back he probably thinks it sounds pretty good.

We've taken something that kills us, and are using it to grow something that will protect us against something else that's also very harmfull. If that's not a big flex for humanity I don't know.   NB! Not only are the cell lines take from tissue that would have to be removed either way. Most of the cell lines comes from animals with cancer. The human once are mostly from adults with cancer. The two exceptions are a blood sample from a 14 year old with leukemia (""lucky"" kid) and a single fetus that was either aborted or miscarriage.

"They do use fertilized eggs for this: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html#cdc_generic_section_2-egg-based-flu-vaccines   I believe that's because the virus needs cells to replicate itself, and an unfertilized egg doesn't have cells   (or sort of is a cell, but only one, and that's not enough. anyway the viruses can't eat yolk or white, they need the embryo)",pervocracy,2025-05-01T11:06:12,3
"In biology, we often use what are called ""Cell Lines"". Human cell lines were once taken from a patient and are either cancer cells, or cells that we can essentially give cancer after removing them from the patient. In either case, the cancer ""immortalizes"" the cells, so we can grow them more or less indefinitely in the lab. They are an essential research tool.  The most famous [and unethical] example are [HeLa Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa). But these days there are hundreds of different cell lines available--different cell types behave differently. A cervical cancer derived cell line will behave differently than a liver derived cell line, for example.   One of the most commonly used human cell lines today is HEK293 cells. The HEK stands for Human Embryonic Kidney, and the cells were originally obtained following a medical abortion in Holland in the 1970s.   These cells have a lot of really useful characteristics for research. They grow quickly. They can be harnessed to make a lot of protein or virus. We can easily infect them with viruses or give them vaccine constructs.   [Some vaccines are *tested* in HEK293s or another embryonically derived cell line from 1985 during the early phases of development](https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues). A rare few viral based vaccines like the Rabies vaccine are even produced in these cell lines before purification steps. So, in a small number of a certain type of vaccine, it is possible that in very rare instances, parts of proteins that have been proven to be harmless from a embryonically derived cell line from an abortion performed 40-50 years ago, could maybe possibly make it into a final vaccine, in which case proteases in your body would harmlessly break it down nearly instantly.",BatManatee,2025-05-01T13:24:35,8
Viruses have to be grown in cells. They are typically grown in wi-38 cell line which is a cell line that was developed from embryonic lung cells. There is still no fetal debris in the MMR vaccine though.  https://www.atcc.org/products/ccl-75,KrunchrapSuprem,2025-05-01T14:11:40,2

I feel like people don‚Äôt even understand the importance of the possibility research provides to those that are suffering. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm saying this very well. But like ‚ÄúHealthyInPublic‚Äù said your mom had hope for the future then became disappointed when the research was dismissed. People want the future to be better even if it doesn‚Äôt help them but it helps other that have issues like then it gives them some comfort. That small comfort is priceless.  Some people who have never had to deal with an illness or had to care for a loved one with a severe condition/ illness don‚Äôt really understand.  Now it‚Äôs happening to research all over the country and it‚Äôs going to be devastating.  I‚Äôm sorry to hear about both of your situations. It‚Äôs important to share.
