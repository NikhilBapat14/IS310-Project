">Christian nationalist Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers (R) recently said that *Obergefell v. Hodges*, the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, is not settled law because “there is just no right to gay marriage in the Constitution” and because marriage is “God’s institution.”  So, Republicans are just saying it out loud that they want to murder LGBTQIA+ people. It's utterly ridiculous how we're having to entertain the idea that Christian nationalists are nothing short of a hate group.",southpawFA,2025-04-25T16:13:52,70

"I think the biggest issue now is that they're not even pretending to care about the hypocrisy.  You could logically argue, make lists of things they've said, and give them Bible quotes till you're blue  in the face.  They'll just continue to believe they are right and better-than and just pretend the facts aren't right there in front of them. It's always the thrice-divorced, chain-smoking middle-management Karen's claiming the high ground and virtuosity because they choose to label themselves as Christian. I'm pretty sure if God were choosing who's called Christian, it would be a very different picture.

They're intolerant, they're hateful, vile, they're spiteful. .... To me, that is the height of hatred, to be silent when we know there are individuals that are engaged in activity, behavior, and an agenda that will destroy them and our nation.""* * “*Gaining access to children has been a long-term goal of the homosexual movement.”* * *“\[W\]elcoming open homosexuality in the military would clearly damage the readiness and effectiveness of the force – in part because it would increase the already serious problem of homosexual assault in the military.”* * *“The reality is, homosexuals have entered the Scouts in the past for predatory purposes.”* * *“The videos are titled 'It Gets Better.' They are aimed at persuading kids that although they'll face struggles and perhaps bullying for 'coming out' as homosexual (or transgendered or some other perversion), life will get better. …It's disgusting. And it's part of a concerted effort to persuade kids that homosexuality is okay and actually to recruit them into that lifestyle.* * *“Family Research Council believes that homosexual conduct is harmful to the persons who engage in it and to society at large, and can never be affirmed. It is by definition unnatural, and as such is associated with negative physical and psychological health effects.”* * *“\[Homosexuality\] … embodies a deep-seated hatred against true religion.”* * *“By ignoring underlying conditions, the demands of transgender supremacy ignore our unique kids, especially those with autism and mental health diagnoses. They deflect much-needed resources away from the pandemic of autism.”*",southpawFA,2025-04-25T16:25:02,6
