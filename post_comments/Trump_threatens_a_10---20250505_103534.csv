"Say you budget for two movies a month. This month,  one of the movies you want is foreign. So, since it costs twice as much, you blow your whole budget on that one, and don't watch the US one.

"What exactly is a “movie” in 2025?  Are we talking about something that spends X amount of time in theaters before going to streaming services? Are we talking about a production that is at least Y minutes long that is intended to be watched in a single session?  Is a production of similar length that is made by a streaming service and never sees a cinema a “movie”?  What’s the difference between a “TV show” and a “movie” in 2025?  For that matter, what about YouTube videos? Are they movies?  Say an American goes on a trip overseas, shoots some footage, gets back to the US, edits their footage into a video, uploads it to YouTube, and monetizes it. Is it tariffed?  What if they edit the footage and upload it overseas? Is that monetized?  If the footage has already been made (as of today) but is post-processed after tariffs go into effect, what then?  Just a few amongst many, many questions.",racedownhill,2025-05-05T12:36:49,1
"The US film industry has actually been lagging the last couple years. There's been a sharp decline in the number of productions stateside, with a pretty large percentage of the work force unemployed and several large vendors shutting their doors from lack of work.  The Teamsters contract that was signed during the strikes really fucked up the budgets for US projects, as they already massively compensated transpo department managed to get significant increases which caused a cascading effect of productions needing to have cuts across all other departments to balance budgets.  Expiring state tax credits or reduced state tax credits have also seen productions leave the US for countries offering better tax credits.",CassadagaValley,2025-05-05T11:15:48,7
trump wants more John Wayne type movies which reduce the history to myths with square jawed white guys as the permanent hero class rather than just watering history down as Hollywood is apt to do these days.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-05-05T11:55:26,5

"Right. I saw a clip recently of some actors on a podcast (maybe Rob Lowe’s?) talking about how everything use to be made in LA, but now nothing is because it cost so much to produce anything there. A lot of productions are overseas or in Canada.   But that doesn’t seem like the federal government’s business. I’m sure many of those productions would prefer to stay in the states if more states were willing to offer tax credits. This is Trump’s tariff bullshit writ large: they want to force production to move back here without offering many incentives or investing in industries.",HenryDorsettCase47,2025-05-05T11:24:37,3

"Yup, although a a federal tax credit in conjunction with a state tax credit is the way to go. Outside of California and NY, most states with film industries probably can't offer the same level of tax credits that other countries are offering.

"""they want to force production to move back here without offering many incentives or investing in industries.""  This is the main issue. Tariffs in themselves aren't necessarily bad, but they're meant to protect an existing industry with some encouragement to expand it. They also rely on there being a decently robust home option to compensate.
