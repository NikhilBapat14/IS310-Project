80% of obamas 5.3 million deportees did not get court hearings for deportation. Once ice confirms you entered illegally they use expedited due process. Its with the norms of our country what trump is doing. It just never got the media spotlight.,starBux_Barista,2025-05-05T12:06:23,170
Everyone has at least one issue that contradicts something else they support even if it defies logic. Look at people that are against the tariffs because there won’t be enough jobs if manufacturing comes back but they support open borders. As if all those people will be able to find jobs. I’ve known people that are anti-war because every life is precious yet they are vehemently pro choice. People are weird,Vag-etarian,2025-05-05T17:46:16,19
The most ironic part about them complaining about 5a is that they can't show a single illegal immigrant that got deported without seeing a judge. There isn't a single case of this happening.   Garcia saw a judge before being deported. They completely fabricated this story.,theboss2461,2025-05-05T11:39:53,104

The issue is many of the immigration judges will prolong the hearings and intentionally draw the process out.  It's the same strategy the circuit courts use. Issue a nationwide injection. Sit on the case even though you already know your ruling. Wait a year. Finally issue a ruling. The case goes to appeal. The appeals court sits on it 6 months then sends it back down to the original judge to review some things. He sits on it for another 6 months before coming back with the same ruling.  Appeals court looks at it again and agreed with circuit. It finally goes to SCOTUS and they send it back down again to be reviewed some more.  The gamelan is to draw it out and hope a new president is elected.,Unlucky_Chip_69247,2025-05-06T06:07:36,3

If someone does not follow the proper process to enter the country they are due no process on the way out. This is consistent with how the courts treat american citizens in other contexts.

All I'm asking for is some logical consistency here. The idea he can drone you without a trial but can't let another country imprison you simply makes no sense. You either require every potential victim of a drone strike to get a two week trial first or not.  No trial should be needed even to imprison non citizens that are illegally present in the US.

You say you are consistent but you are not. No one on your side of the argument is that's the problem. They only care now because it's Trump. They didn't have a word of condemnation when actual citizens had their actual due process rights violated and were locked up for years without a trial... because in that case it was being done to conservatives. When they finally did get a trial it was with a judge and jury of 100% their political opponents who hate them, not the impartial jury they were due under the constitution.  So where is the consistency? If the american citizens weren't due any process to be imprisoned then certainly non citizens that followed no process to come in are due nothing either.
