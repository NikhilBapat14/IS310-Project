"Howard Dean was on the call announcing this, according to the article.  They give Dean credit for being ""the architect of the original 50-state strategy.""",gadgetygirl,2025-04-24T15:58:09,72

"We need a bold platform that gets people excited, not just more of the same. Saying we'll make some tepid changes if Republicans will cooperate isn't getting us anywhere. The platform has to be brash and relentless.  And ffs, stop extending the hand to Republicans. We lose progressives every single time we extend the hand.",blightsteel101,2025-04-24T16:06:43,54

Yup you canâ€™t just campaign in swing states.  Abolish citizens united too. Make that a central campaign pledge and people will pay attention but they sure do love those corpo dollars,GoldenboyFTW,2025-04-24T19:32:58,8

I'm really confused by this. Why not focus on the Blue Wall and other swing states?,Then_Entertainment97,2025-04-25T10:35:34,0
"I don't think abandoning the swing state strategy is a good plan. I don't see how spending presidential campaign resources in California or Texas help their chances.  The main thing hurting the Democratic Party recently has been not having robust primaries. Unless the candidate is an overwhelmingly popular incumbent, primaries are critical for securing a mandate.",Then_Entertainment97,2025-04-25T17:31:16,0
They should put him in charge again. The DNC was never so powerful as it was when Dean was in the driver's seat.,Demortus,2025-04-24T18:33:22,29
Did he start the call with a yah?!  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_scream,MNCPA,2025-04-24T16:19:59,-18
"Part of the agenda should be a clear path to punishing the current admin. This whole ""optics"" talking point is just an excuse to slow walk and never actually have people face consequences. Let the Republicans scream about unfair. They have lost their right to complain",mr_birkenblatt,2025-04-24T17:01:45,22
"So this article isnâ€™t really about platform, itâ€™s resource allocation as I understand it that can work with literally any platform.",Michael70z,2025-04-24T19:26:39,3

It doesn't seem to be working. We have tried that in the past and it just doesn't work as well as we would like. Now is the time to try something different,Rosebunse,2025-04-25T17:04:27,1
"Ken Martin is solid at least, weâ€™ve had an undefeated record for statewide elections in Minnesota starting when he became DFL chair.",Michael70z,2025-04-24T19:25:10,9
Seriously?  Governor Dean was a great candidate and Democrat. DfA did great work for Democrats and the 50 state strategy helped us get out of the Bush II years. Yet someone always has to bring up the dumb scream.,David_R_Martin_II,2025-04-24T17:10:25,22
"A clear path, yes, but also an explicitly fair path. We need to be the party of timely, transparent justice. The prosecution of every member of the current admin needs to be extremely publicized, not only to discredit each and every individual, but to demonstrate that Democrats stand for the laws put forth in the Constitution.",blightsteel101,2025-04-24T17:11:05,11
"""Punishing"" people is not a platform that will appeal to anyone who isn't already voting straight dem. That isn't to say that we shouldn't investigate people we think broke the law when we have a chance, but that isn't something we can or should campaign on.",Demortus,2025-04-24T18:35:18,0
"Well, that's sort of the point. If you only arm the police, then you can easily have a police state. If you arm both, it's always got to be in the back of their minds. Why Democrats want to de-arm the civilians but not the police, who already don't have a great reputation, is a mystery to me.",BoarnotBoring,2025-04-24T16:27:19,-1
"There are lots of things to change. I don't see how spending resources in Texas or California help their chances of winning the presidency.  Personally, I think the best indicator of success in recent history has been a robust primary process.",Then_Entertainment97,2025-04-25T17:22:03,0
"Oh yeah, Ken was a fantastic pick. I'm just frustrated that David Hogg has a seat at the table..",Demortus,2025-04-24T19:29:13,-2

"We followed Common Law for centuries in America. It was precedent that guns belong in your house, safely stored. It was a long held norm that you can't travel with guns or any kind of bladed weapon. There was a huge difference between guns for militia use and guns for personal use back then. Cities back then banned people from bringing guns into town. If there was a gunman, the norm was to flee. Courts also took guns away from people deemed as menaces or threats.   In the 21st century, there is little that civilians or private militias can do against police. Sure, someone can down a couple officers, but a civilian or militia in this day and age would be outmatched 1 million to one.   The oppression that the framers of the constitution were worried about was the federal government using the standing army the way that the English government did. Before independence, the English government imposed their rule by telling the colonies that the standing army must be maintained at the colonists' expense. This meant that colonists who started to see themselves as American rather than English had to shelter loyalist Redcoats in their homes or on their properties.",[deleted],2025-04-24T16:54:59,6

"He got democrats elected across Minnesota for years, while the rest of the Midwest was turning red. What has David Hogg done to get democrats elected?",Demortus,2025-04-29T23:03:46,2
"I wasn't defending David Hogg. I was excited for Ken Martin to get the job. Since his acceptance speech, I haven't seen or heard much so was asking an honest question. I follow him on Blue Sky.   I expected more from him during the special elections in FL.",Iata_deal4sea,2025-04-30T10:11:43,2
"Ahh got it. Sorry for the misunderstanding!   With the Florida special elections, while we did lose, these were deep red districts and we did overperform our 2024 numbers by quite a bit. If we overperform like that nationally, it would be a blue wave election!",Demortus,2025-04-30T12:14:22,1
Other groups were on the ground which I appreciated. I donated a few bucks to them. I was hopeful the DNC would use some cash to full court press.,Iata_deal4sea,2025-04-30T13:02:24,2
