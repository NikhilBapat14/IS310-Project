Just a though. But maybe we shouldn't have stupid people run the country,southofakronoh,2025-04-22T13:47:46,41
“He did so even though an aide had already warned him about sharing sensitive information”  I’m gonna guess he shared it *because* he was warned not to. Hegseth seems like a “hold my beer” kinda guy. ,clickmagnet,2025-04-22T14:23:31,31

"From Sabrina Singh, former deputy press secretary for the Department of Defense:  That the Trump administration would have another Signal scandal is not surprising, but it doesn’t make this weekend’s revelations about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth any less staggering. We learned that last month, Hegseth recklessly shared strike plans — endangering American fighter pilots and our sailors — in not just one unclassified group chat, but two.  Shortly before the U.S. military conducted a complex operation striking the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, the defense secretary shared sensitive national security and operational information about American troops on a Signal chat with his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer — people who had no reason to need to know about these upcoming strikes.

He was a DUI hire,Methos43,2025-04-22T13:59:25,9
He was in the military didn’t think blabbing about top secret military ops on a common messenger app  wasn’t a smart idea. You would be court martialed and  looking at years in prison if you did this while a member of the armed services,Browns45750,2025-04-22T13:54:14,8
This is what happens when you put an alcoholic with mow IQ and no.   morales   values or ethics in an office that is built on discipline integrity and protecting our men and women who risk their lives everyday. His military record is a joke and he is not qualified to even play a game of battleship. He needs to go. Maybe Ek Salvador would better suit him.,RakhshandaC,2025-04-22T14:01:11,5
The only thing that matters is Hegseth will follow up with even Trump's illegal orders. Pete is the perfect guy for Trump. You will see when Trump start to use the military against US citizens.,NorthenFreeman,2025-04-22T14:48:21,3

I dont really even know what my Colonel Brother in Air Force and now Space Force intelligence does. I dont even know where he works or travels.   This MFer is just throwing it out there for free. My brother would be disappeared real fast if what he probably knows gets out. Again I have no idea. I just know he works for the military.,stinky_wizzleteet,2025-04-22T20:34:03,6
I actually imagine he shotgunned the beer and then smashed can against his forehead.,TheRabidGoose,2025-04-22T21:37:02,3
It was pretty apparent from the way the messages in the first chat were written by all (not questioning a signal chat for this type of communication) that this is a regularly occurring thing. It was just the first time it was leaked for public knowledge.,SpinTheWheeland,2025-04-22T19:08:44,4
