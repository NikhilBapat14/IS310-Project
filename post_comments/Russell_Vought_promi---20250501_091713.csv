"Shh. The Project 2025 point man in the White House is speaking. Oh, and he's the ideologue behind dismantling the government's key services, probably running point at DOGE as well.   And note the Washington Examiner is a Moonie-cult-owned far-right propaganda rag.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T09:25:00,9

"Trump's own USMCA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico took **2 1/2 years** to put together.  And that was a revision of NAFTA, not an entirely new agreement.  NAFTA had taken about six years to put together.  In any case, why would anyone want to negotiate in earnest with the US when Trump doesn't honor the agreements that they already have, including the agreements that his own administration negotiated?  The Canadians and Mexicans should drop a copy of the agreement that they already have on Lutnick's desk, then tell him to read it and go screw himself.",I405CA,2025-05-01T10:04:22,4
What deals would people do with a person who has zero credibility?,thieh,2025-05-01T09:21:35,3
"Faster than what? They have 0 deals so far, so literally finishing a single deal would make it 'faster' than the current pace.",HarwellDekatron,2025-05-01T09:34:30,3
"With those 200 deals already done, this acceleration is sure to push them into the thousands or tens of thousands of deals. With that many deals, we may learn the details of at least one of them.",30mil,2025-05-01T09:28:34,2

"There must be something wrong with the list of countries. 86 countries are subject to punitive tariffs by Trump, but 75 countries have lowered their tariffs.

"No, my mistake, it is the Washington Times that is owned by the Moonies, not the Examiner. Thanks for the sanity check.      The Examiner is still a right-wing rag, though. Owned by Phil Anschutz, a well known contributor to the Heritage Foundation, the AEI, and the Federalist Society. Bit of a libertarian type guy, but far-right sympathizing to say the least.",steve_ample,2025-05-01T09:34:23,3

I bet every time they've tried to talk to China they simply ask 'are you ready to drop the tariffs yet? No? KTHXBYE'.,HarwellDekatron,2025-05-01T09:56:07,2

"China is in a *far* better bargaining position than the US, because they've taken the untold billions, maybe trillions, of dollars we've pumped into their economy, and invested into themselves.   People have derided China for being ""the world's factory"" for decades now, and now they're laughing all the way to the bank.   China can afford to sit back and let the US sweat, and the Trump admin is acting like they've got China right where they want them. It'd be hilarious in how performative it is, if that false bravado wasn't going to hurt an overwhelming majority of the US population.",DocShocker,2025-05-01T10:10:25,3
"Exactly. Another interesting point is that China is culturally very integrated. When they think of themselves as 'Chinese' they don't think 'I am Chinese because I was born in this particular place', they think about an identity going back *millennia*.  Trump thinks that the US stopping imports from China will generate a massive uproar inside of the country, which will make the Chinese government buckle at the knees and come asking for forgiveness. What he doesn't realize is that cultural identity, norms, and the iron fist of the CCP make sure that's not gonna happen at all. There's literally no reason whatsoever for the CCP to come pleading, but on the other hands there's a million reasons why the CCP *wants* the US to become more isolated. It's all upsides for them.  So yeah, Trump is a very stupid man, and Americans are about to learn a very important lesson about electing idiots just because they sound 'tough'.",HarwellDekatron,2025-05-01T10:55:40,1
