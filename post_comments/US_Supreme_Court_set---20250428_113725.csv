"Two legit arguments....  1) The public schools are such dismal, irredeemable failures that private/charter schools are the only way to properly educate American children.  2) This breaks the firewall between church and state (even if a charter school is technically not religious, it is the precursor for public funding of Catholic and other private schools).....and lays the groundwork for future nightmares like Islamic madrassas being publicly funded in the USA.  Personally, I happen to believe in the practical utility of competition in producing excellence....and the lack of competition is one reason (among many) to explain the horrific decline of public schools in America.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-28T11:47:07,10
1: Ask yourself why they are a failure.  2: If we end the Federal Dept of Education AND stop funding public schools with FEDERAL money then the Separation of Church and state does not apply. The 1st Amendment says CONGRESS shall make no laws. Which means that the States can do what they want even if it is a Religious school because no federal money is applied.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T12:36:46,-5
"""This breaks the firewall between church and state""  No one is compelled to attend the Charter school.  Nor are Catholics being supported as other religious groups are being excluded from participating by creating their own charter school.",49thbotdivision,2025-04-28T12:36:39,-8
"\>Ask yourself why they are a failure.  1) The hyper-ideological orientation of the Ed Schools....which have become cesspools of neo-Marxism....thoroughly indoctrinating young teachers without adequately training them....so that they can in turn indoctrinate our children at the same time they fail them academically.  2) The lack of competition gives public schools no impetus for reforming.  3) A corrupt teacher's union apparatus serves itself above all else, the children be damned.  Your second point is somewhat valid....excepting that even without a DoE, public schools will continue to be at least partially funded with federal grants. Meanwhile, let's project ahead 50 years....and Michigan has its first Muslim Governor....and begins state funding of madrassas to serve Michigan's growing Muslim population. Any concerns about such an eventuality?  As I indicated in my first post, I'm FOR state funding of charter/private schools....but I am also concerned about where it might lead.",Vessarionovich,2025-04-28T12:58:52,6
So start with removing the Federal Department of Education which has been the sledgehammer that has forced public schools to do these things.  Public Schools in the US were extremely good UNTIL the Federal Dept of Education.,ComputerRedneck,2025-04-28T13:10:21,1
The part about Muslim school is acceptable if other religions have the same access using the same criteria. My guess is that they will not. The university will tell us to avoid talking about Christmas while teaching us about Ramadan.,AppState1981,2025-04-29T12:49:08,1
