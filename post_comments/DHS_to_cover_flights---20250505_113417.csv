"Realistically, who is going to take this option?  Let's see... on the one hand an illegal could risk staying here and make $1000 easily and try to stay under the radar and take their chances of not being deported or they could self report, get $1000 now, and go back to a life of squalor in some shit hole that they tried to escape from.",bw2082,2025-05-05T11:38:30,14
FFS - I know this is likely a cost effective incentive to get these folks to go home. But it still chaps my ass that we're paying these people + giving them free plane tickets to get them to piss off when they shouldn't be here in the first place.,WPWeasel,2025-05-05T12:40:04,12
No stipends.,kaytin911,2025-05-05T13:36:55,4
"every bit helps. This would save money if even a few thousand left because of it. The arsenal of federal laws and reasons to deport or encourage to self deport is larger than i suspected.  And the admin has not even touched a few of them YET.  There are some relatively  severe but legally justified things they could do but have not.   I do suspect what we have seen so far is part of a campaign to get them to self deport. Self deport or get sent to a third world prison for example. Your choice. Self deport you and you family or risk your spouse, mom or dad getting deported on their own.   Things like that will have an impact.",SerendipitySue,2025-05-05T16:27:57,2
Not to mention they could just wait for the next D President to give them amnesty and a path to citizenship.,Proof_Responsibility,2025-05-05T12:15:42,6

Why the fuck are they offering stipends.  There should be more severe entry bans too. Anyone that gives birth in the US to try to give themselves an anchor baby should be banned for life. The citizen kid can live in the US or come back but the parent should be out for life.,kaytin911,2025-05-05T13:38:15,2
Same but this is a low price to pay for people that are using resources and not contributing. Doesn’t look or feel good though. ,Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-05-05T14:14:39,3
