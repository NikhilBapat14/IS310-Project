Prediction: It will basically be what these two countries were doing before Trump got elected…and Trump will declare victory.,GrandFrogPrince,2025-05-08T04:11:25,17
How many golf resorts will the UK have to build to get rid of tarriffs?,duke_chute,2025-05-08T06:11:26,3
"The thing is though, as a general public we simply don't want your products. So even if our government gives the go-ahead for chlorinated chicken, oversized rust-prone uneconomical cars or hormone treated beef (Etc), we're not going to buy it, because why would you when you can already have so much better?    America needs to bring it's standards up to Europes. If these trade deals get forced through without the standards being raised, I will actively avoid US products because I've seen 1st hand how unhealthy Americans are and (no offense) I don't want to become how the average American looks & feels, which is pretty  unhealthy. ",Creative_Recover,2025-05-08T06:35:36,3

"Quote: The United States and Britain are expected to announce a deal to lower tariffs on some goods on Thursday, the first such agreement since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed levies on countries around the world. Trump posted on Truth Social that he would hold an Oval Office news conference at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT) on Thursday about a ""major trade deal with representatives of a big, and highly respected, country.",DrThomasBuro,2025-05-08T04:09:10,1

"Well yeah. The US has a trade surplus with the UK. According to the demands Trump has made and backed up with tariffs, he wants a surplus with every country, so there's nothing significant about this agreement.",biscuitarse,2025-05-08T07:34:20,1

> Trump will declare victory.  The Brexit nutters over here will get very excited as well.  And this deal will be worth exactly as little as every other thing with Trump's signature on it: nothing.,DaveChild,2025-05-08T05:06:02,5
"They (the UK govt) have been begging for a US trade deal since brexit. To no avail. Depending on what is in the deal, this could easily be viewed more as the US caved in that light.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-05-08T04:59:04,2
"ah yes, the chlorine chicken thing.   Well, let's see.",wijnandsj,2025-05-08T05:06:52,1
"From what I understand, the UK govt recently has been saying no deals with the US would include anything that go against current UK food and health guidelines.   Not to say politicians don't lie or change course, but it would be odd to publicly announce something so soon to walking it back.",Cute-Ad2879,2025-05-08T05:09:34,1
