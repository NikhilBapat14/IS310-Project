The thing to remember about Harvard is that they have a whole bunch of lawyers who were trained at Harvard.  I would not want to face them in court.,Wisco,2025-04-23T12:23:19,222

"I don't know all the details, but didn't the Trump administration send another message to Harvard that basically said, ""Oops, we didn't mean to send that letter. Proceed with whatever you want. Don't mind us.""  Don't comply in advance.     Stand up to the bullies.     They will back down.     They are cowards.",OwlfaceFrank,2025-04-23T14:10:06,72

But if, as you say, the truth is fluid, that the truth is subjective, then maybe you *can* fight the system. As long as just one person refuses to be broken, refuses to bow down.

"Kick his ass, Harvard.",juni4ling,2025-04-23T19:45:06,4
"I heard it was largely because the Trump team gave the game away when it came to Harvard. They basically admitted there was no deal they could possibly strike, they would seek to harm Harvard.  So Harvard rolled up its sleeves, lit a cigarette, and reminded everyone they have billions in funding and their biggest export are lawyers. A number of them are pretty good at what they do too.  Few other universities were as well equipped for this, nor was the administration as brazen with them, apparently. Genuinely I doubt Harvard wanted to do this, they just felt backed into a corner and decided they had literally nothing to lose by throwing a swing.",BigRedSpoon2,2025-04-23T23:36:25,3
