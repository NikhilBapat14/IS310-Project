">The European Union graciously offered to negotiate with Donald Trump on tariffs before retaliating, but the U.S. president is too blinded by his own conspiracy to even consider the deal.  >On Monday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered the United States a “zero-for-zero tariff” on cars and industrial goods to avoid a trade war \[...\] Trump, however, told reporters Monday afternoon that the deal isn’t enough. “The EU has been very tough over the years, I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States and trade,” Trump said. “That’s the reason it was formed.”  >In case you forgot, the EU was not, in fact, formed to screw the United States but to foster peace and cooperation among European countries post-World War II. It was founded in 1992 and is made up of 27 countries and seven major institutions that manage a common budget, facilitate trade, and make laws.   >The president continued his rewrite of European history, claiming the EU was formed solely “to create a unified force against the United States for trade.” \[...\]",P_a_s_g_i_t_24,2025-04-07T19:42:12,1
"You have to call him out on the fact he does not know anything about history, and never forgot anything. There are always two aspects to ignorance:  \*What you do not know  \*What you refuse to know     We are all partly guilty of one aspect. And that is not the truly important one.",steve_ample,2025-04-07T19:54:07,1
He is not mentally competent. How is anyone suppose to negotiate with him when he is so confused he doesn't understand trade. He keeps accusing countries of one thing or another. I haven't looked it up but I'm sure the USA has higher tariffs on many countries compared to the tariffs they have against the USA. It is time for congress to proclaim Trump is incompetent and unable to hold the presidency.,a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-07T20:11:32,1
