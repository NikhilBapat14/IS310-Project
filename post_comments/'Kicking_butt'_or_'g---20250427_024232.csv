"Ignorance is bliss. Whenever the press interviews trump supporters, I'm disheartened at the lack of information and the foolishness these people possess.    >Musk is a character I don't understand,"" June says. ""My feeling is that if Trump has trusted him as much as he has, than he must be a pretty good guy with the right ideas and the right goals.""  >She previously told the BBC she was concerned about welfare spending and hoped Trump would push Americans to be more self-sufficient. While she is happy with the cuts so far, she hopes they leave alone social security - the monthly government payments that she and 67 million retired or disabled Americans live off.  >Democrats warn those are at risk in future, but June asks: ""Why would they cut [social security] when they've cut so many things that have saved them millions and millions of dollars?""",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T02:44:59,11

"Trump - or more probably Trump's advisors, since I don't think he has the intelligence or self-awareness - knew that there would be a limited ""honeymoon"" period where the public would accept moreorless anything that the government did, and exploited this to do what they have done.

"It's quite simple IMHO. They equate morality with identity rather than with words and actions. They can do no wrong because of who they are. They identify with Trump so he can do no wrong. Trump associates with Musk, so he can do no wrong as long as that association lasts.  This is just an aspect of the broader fact that these are reactionaries. They see society as an unchanging social and moral hierarchy based on identity. They feel morally better than those they look down on or those they dislike and thus they deserve a higher social status than them. Programs like social security are only good insofar as they benefit them, and bad insofar as they benefit everyone equally. The idea of self-sufficiency is simply a facade with which they justify their idea that they are superior to those others who don't deserve help.  In short, they will rationalize everything Trump has done to justify their support for and identification with him. He can not be wrong because then they would be wrong. They want to cut social security for those groups they don't like, but keep it intact for themselves, because they reject the principle of equality and the idea that human life has a worth of its own, which is also why reactionaries always end up rejecting democracy and those institutions that are predicated on equality (human rights, the rule of law, universal civic rights, social security, ...).",barryvm,2025-04-27T03:08:31,12

"That subreddit is so odd. They claim that the politics sub is the same, but absolutely not.   You see posts from the same IDs over and over. And many posts have 0 comments. Almost everything is Flaired only. There may be 60 comments, but you can only see 3 . When there is a hot topic, I go there to see how they are responding and am often shocked to see no posts on the subject whatsoever.  Just sensationalist headlines from right wing  rags - it's like the National Enquirer at the checkout line - Bat Boy Found!   The nonsense - you think no one can believe this stupidity, but then MAGA interviews show you that yes,  real people believe these things. Some is so over the top, even if you are partisan, a normal person would know it's too stupid to be true.  The other day was amusing - someone posted about the Morning Joe show talking about the hate right wing people have for Pope Francis. They called morning Joe a jerk for saying stupid shit - they then proceeded in the comments to prove him right.   But most times after reading the sub, I feel like taking a shower because the comments in there are so gross/creepy.",SicilyMalta,2025-04-27T09:10:25,1

What's interesting though is they created a fake reality to live in while the Gop destroys the actual reality the rest of us have to be aware of.   Denial is insanely powerful. ,Greencheek16,2025-04-27T12:27:34,2
"Those on social security get very upset when I remind them that their paltry input in 1976 paid for their grandparents' retirement and young people today, along with immigrants,  are paying for their retirement.

">  I don’t think June is a fascist, but blindly follows.  That's the thing though: if you support a pretty obvious fascist, either because you think you will get something out of it or because you align with the ideology (whatever that is) while rejecting the label, are you not a fascist, if a lukewarm or cynical one?  The idea that fascists are always monsters is IMHO a comforting myth. Most of them were fairly normal people who, had a core of selfishness and exceptionalism, were susceptible to anger or fear, and had the ability to turn off their empathy towards those they had ""othered"". In another context, they would have voted for your standard right wing parties. In the wrong context, they will support killing anyone they don't like, and find endless reasons to either ignore or justify that, insisting that they are good people. History suggests that a significant fraction of the right will support fascism if they are afraid or angry enough, and even in normal times they tend to be afraid of change and angry at other people.  > Where are the lines drawn? Will they (MAGA) sit in the pot of water while turning up the heat?  The line is that they are personally targeted, but that won't matter in the wider scope of things. The reason reactionary populist (e.g. fascist) movements work despite the constant factional strife and disdain or hatred between groups within the movement is that to be part of one you have to have some degree of selfishness, exceptionalism and lack of, or the ability to turn off, empathy. Because of this, and because they all identify with the movement, they all think they are at the center of it, that they are special within the movement as well as in society as a whole. Hence, when they themselves are ""othered"", it will come as a complete surprise. Worse: due to the selfishness and lack of empathy, they will gleefully participate in ostracizing others right up to the point where it happens to them. There is no solidarity, so even as more and more people are stabbed in the back there will never be a point where they band together and resist. At best, they'll become neutral bystanders as the rest of society battles these movements, at worst they keep helping them in the hope of getting accepted again.  Note how they're adopting the ""good king, bad counselors"" myth. Trump is trying to do good, but his evil advisors are the ones who do the harm to those who matter (they don't care about everyone else). Why? Because they identify with him, and they are good people by definition, hence Trump must be a good person. His advisors are therefore the ones who will be blamed.",barryvm,2025-04-27T05:40:34,5
"Thank you for the input. I tend to give most people the benefit of doubt because I want to see the good in people. I believe in change. But I believe in integrity and justice.

Yoko Taro, guy that writes sad video games about how fucked up people can be.    People have main character syndrome and refuse to think they could be supporting a fascist. They have to blow off Trump outright acknowledging that he could kill someone and not lose supporters with ""oh he'd never do that"".    Thing is, even if Trump wasn't a killer, being that enabled by supporters can turn him into one. ",Greencheek16,2025-04-27T12:23:26,1
">  I tend to give most people the benefit of doubt because I want to see the good in people.   And you should, because these are generalizations. There will always be people who pull out of this. And even the people who stay in are still people, not monsters. For one, those people are relatives, friends, colleagues, ... You can't really afford to write them off.  My point is more that any political strategy to deal with this should never rely on any major rifts within or large scale defections from Trump's movement. That will not happen. There will never be a moment where they all conclude a line has been crossed and do something about it. The frog will boil alive. The people you need to mobilize are all the hangers on and those who don't care either way. Another strategy is to go after the money men and the media companies, without whom these movements would not be able to sustain themselves.  > Maybe not “their” line, but the line I stop being compassionate and looking out for my best interests.  In a sense the dilemma has been solved already, no? You don't need to act against them, just against the government they put in power.  > It’s a conflicting place for me as I’m sure many others.  That is good IMHO. It is never a good sign if people have no moral qualms in situations like these.",barryvm,2025-04-27T07:56:03,3
"Indeed. That's basically the lesson that we should have learned from that, but somehow didn't, preferring the easy, comforting depiction of the enemy as somehow fundamentally different. The truth is that a lot of people are capable of this, given the wrong circumstances. You don't need an army of monsters to do monstrous things, just people who can ignore the things before their eyes, follow orders, and convince themselves that they're not responsible, that they had no choice.  Hence why the ludicrous and outlandish rhetoric pushed by Republicans was not funny but rather dangerous. It's ludicrous because what they need to justify is so immoral and so extreme that they need to twist reality and morality around it. It's a massive red flag, a major step towards political violence. That was ignored, and now the USA is where it is.",barryvm,2025-04-28T09:21:10,2
