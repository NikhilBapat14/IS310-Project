"Armed resistance is coming. They are inching towards it. It's baked in, it will be the excuse to mobilize the military. Hegsdeath needs time to position the Army. He is super Army focused. He sees no need to put effort into the Navy or the Air Force and probably doesn't even know he controls the Coast Guard. The Marines will remain undeployed as a reserve force that they figure will remain loyal to the Presidentacy. I'd keep an eye on the California National Guard. I'm not üíØ on how the key positions in NG units go, but I'd imagine the DoD still has some degree of control over who holds commanding general positions. The Army doesn't have a large presence in California. The NG would be the primary force if we are talking complete military control of major cities and states. I bet keeping an eye on which units are training at the NTC in the coming months would be an indication. Maybe a larger than usual exercise is being planned?   It wouldn't be too hard to lurk the service based reddits to hear chatter about whose got a rotation to the NTC coming up. I'd imagine the bases in the reddest of states would be the most likely candidates. There won't be as much resistance in those areas, along with it being likely that vocally loyal assets have long been in place within the NG units. Drunkie Dolittle doesn't need to waste precious time stacking Red State units. The limited resistance from the small blue pockets in the those states could be controlled by the NG. California and Pac Nothwest and the Northeast will be the break away regions. I don't think there is much the Air Force and Naval involvement. Even with complete control of the upper ranks, no way the Navy or Air Force would participate in the art of warfare that they would being to the pacification of the early resistance. No sane Captain or Group Admiral is going to participate against domestic land based targets. I would say the same would be true for colonel and 1/2 star level generals of the Air Force. They will stay out the fray at first. They will be probably be the initial Federal assets to align with the resistance. Maybe a charismatic AF general tries to set up a break away a national in the Mid-West. At best, the Navy chokes off Chicago. Maybe blocks material support from Europe. The 10th Mountain, maybe stayed parked up north. Cutoff any incursions from Canada.   Death by firing squads will be the first tool used by the military to enforce internal discipline. There will definitely be refusals to follow orders. The first deaths of the coup d'√©tat tat will be those of the heros of the resistance in the military who disobey direct orders to break their oath the Constitution.   But what do I knowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm just some stoner in his garage.  Could you imagine Alex Jones' head exploding if anything close to this was publicly happening during Obama or Biden?  Remember folks, with all this craziness going,  no one has absolutely any fucking idea what the intelligence agencies are up to. Trump could have signed top-secret EOs for the itnel orgs to go crazy.

"You should probably look into when the U.S. government actually tried rolling tanks and platoons into U.S. cities to quell riots, back in the 60s and 70s.  It went poorly. Civilians set up sniper nests and took out soldiers with impunity, moving from building to building via fire escapes and rooftops. Soldiers became so paranoid that they started to shoot at anything that moved, increasing the chaos on the ground. The military and the police clashed over who was in charge. The military and the civilian governments of states and cities clashed, especially when casualties started to mount. No one came out looking stronger, even if riots were eventually quelled.",DiceMadeOfCheese,2025-05-07T11:59:19,3
