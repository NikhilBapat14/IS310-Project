"There are four aspects concerning this subject I'd like to highlight:  The first aspect is that 'they' (certain migrant groups) are here (western Europe), because we were there (Asia, Africa, the Americas) in colonial times. As a consequence of colonial empires, people from there migrated to the specific mother country that ruled these areas. That can be because of certain citizenship rights, the relevant language skills, or just previous family contacts. You can see which places were ruled by which mother country by looking at the origins of the (larger) migrant groups. The colonial experience overseas also sets west European countries apart from east European countries, who lack this history.  The second aspect is labour migration. After World War II western Europeans needed a lot of labour for reconstruction and economic growth. At first they looked to southern European countries for labour migration, later to elsewhere in the world. These people were often invited, but not necessarily expected to stay for the longer term. People from the second or third generation sometimes found themselves to be second class citizens in a country they were born in.  The third aspect is that multiculturalism was/is not always seen as positive, yet the experience of World War II and memory of the crimes of the Nazis made any criticism of foreign immigration rather taboo. From the 1980s onward however right-wing populists have mobilised nativism in the native population and heavily criticized 'political correctness' on the subject of multiculturalism. So popularity is not a given.  The last aspect is that east European countries had a lot of multiculturalism up to World War I in various multinational empires. But their main lessons of WW I and II has been that  mononational/monocultural nation-states are necessary to avoid war, as any ethnic minority within your borders could lead to aggression from a neighbouring state. Ethnic cleansing and deportations during and after the world wars led to suddenly very homogeneous populations in these countries afterwards. The experiences of Communist dictatorships also caused people to treasure their national identity and monoculture, although there was some migration within the Communist bloc, for example with Vietnamese moving to Czechoslovakia.   I hope this explains some of the differences in stances towards multiculturalism in (very) broad strokes.",PoliticalAnimalIsOwl,2022-11-30T11:23:33,4
"It's not a US/Canada/Europe thing but a wealth/education thing.  The kind of Westerner you're paying attention to is probably someone who is relatively well off compared to the global average, has spent much of their early life in the same sort of educational institutions, has the same basic values with regards to how they approach life and is largely unshackled from any specific geographic location.  This means they view 'cultural' oddities as minor, irrelevant quirks. They have a shared culture with an entire cadre of global 'elites' like themselves.  However, most people in the world aren't like this. Even when they share similar outlooks on life, they have trouble finding commonality with others. They tend to be locked into geography. All those superficial quirks aren't any less superficial but they're far more important indicators of who shares their values.  This 'elites' vs. 'common folk' distinction is what gives rise to your observation. It just so happens that not only are 'elites' more prevalent in the Western world (due to wealth) but those 'elites' are the primary focus of other 'elites'. You know all about Kim Kardashian. You know nothing about - nor care about - Kim Kardashian's gardener.",ViskerRatio,2022-12-01T15:17:46,2

"I will also add that it is not universally popular in Western Europe. France, for instance, prides itself on being ""multiracial"" but not multicultural. Anyone can ""become french,"" but being french requires complete assimilation into French culture. And that's not just an ideal that is often enforced by the state (see burqa, niqab, and burkini bans, bans on kosher and halal slaughter, etc), and that approach is fairly common in other French-speaking and Catholic countries in Western Europe.  And so as not to suggest this is an Anglo-Protestant/Romantic-Catholic thing, ""Anti-multicultural"" political parties have also been extremely successful in nordic countries, which are also usually considered part of ""Western Europe."" Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands all have anti-immigrant or far-right parties either in government or as the main opposition.",loselyconscious,2022-11-30T16:01:13,2
"I can't agree to this at all.  I know plenty of rich/educated people in south america, asia and africa and none of them like or propagate multiculturalism.",[deleted],2022-12-02T04:53:29,2
"I don't agree with this fundamentally, do you have sources or stats that support this that I can look at?  I would argue that most middle, lower, and even high class white Americans value our melting pot as a core American value. It's not just a tagline, we enjoy experiencing and being a part of other peoples' cultures, even if some of us are ignorant about them.  I would say across the spectrum Americans appreciate those who come here to make their lives better, even if it's just because feeds our ego about being the best.   Stories about people who leave third world countries to come here to own their own business, or even to work simple labor jobs and send money home to their families, are very heartwarming and deeply appreciated.",yaya-pops,2022-12-05T12:28:56,1
"It's not about races and ethnicities. My question is about multiculturalism.  Edit: Your post is deeply racist in itself. Claiming that western Europe is ""smart enough"" compared to ""the rest of the world"" (which I mentioned in my text as the comparison subject) which the apparently is not smart enough to realize what europeans realized.  That's a deeply problematic opinion that you have there.",[deleted],2022-12-06T03:06:04,1
