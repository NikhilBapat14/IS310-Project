"If you prefer names to descriptive phrases, the prospective replacement for National Security Advisor is Steve Witkoff.  Witkoff had no government experience before being selected as Trump's ""Special Envoy"" for negotiations with Russia and Iran; he is a wealthy real estate developer.

And then, while she was in the bathroom, he arranged himself in the adjoining bedroom, making it obvious he was ready for sex.
