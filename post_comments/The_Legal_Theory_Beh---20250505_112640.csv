"The rehabilitation of Nixon is wild. Yet, in comparison with Trump…",LoreAppropriate791,2025-05-05T11:32:50,48
My favorite part of conservative legal theory is that it all seems to come down to the belief that it's all been a National Treasure-esque riddle that conservatives just needed to solve to unlock all these powers that they believe the Founding Fathers hid for the chosen ones.,katyadc,2025-05-05T12:34:43,20
Nixon was a visionary. After all he said “when the president does it. It’s not illegal”  ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T11:54:59,7

Yup. Republicans aren’t ideological. They don’t care about the issues. They work for the donor-class. Their divisive rhetoric is generated after the fact and it’s just meant to distract us from the graft.   Republicans don’t care about political theory. They don’t care about gender. They don’t want to stop abortions. And they don’t believe in God. Republicans are mercenaries.,Gash_Stretchum,2025-05-05T21:21:04,1
Even in comparison to trump. Nixon was like worse ? Dude bombed Cambodia and Vietnam. The whole last copter out of Saigon was as his fault. Man covered up the break in at the watergate hotel. Nixon had the original enemies list. Trump wishes he could be as effective as Nixon. Like Donald trump is dollar store Nixon at best. Nixon had his own white house wire tapped. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T11:54:31,19
Wait to you hear about Hitler’s recent popularity surge.,ShrimpieAC,2025-05-05T13:02:10,2
"And they see themselves as some sort of cosplaying patriots in the mold of 1776. Anything that contradicts their views is a clear and present danger. They use word salads and pretzel logic to come up with far afield legal theories, saying that any opposition is trying to cover up the truth. The antidote to this should be the Congress but they’re drinking from the same poisoned well.",RedditReader4031,2025-05-05T13:15:58,6
"Have you not heard? Textualism is a relative term now.  The founding fathers didn't really mean ""due process' or Birthright citizenship.  You are so 2024.",sane_sober61,2025-05-05T16:22:18,2
They won't because their legal theory is only really used to support whatever they believe benefits themselves the most personally.,eugene20,2025-05-05T18:47:24,1
"Truth  Nixon, Reagan and the Bushes don't get enough shit.",Massive-Height-2936,2025-05-05T12:09:00,16
I was thinking more of ignoring the law. You are right that Nixon did more with the military.,LoreAppropriate791,2025-05-05T13:24:10,1
I think the sum total of human suffering Nixon caused during his time in office is definitely larger than what Trump did the first time around. (Guess we will see this time!)  There is one very important difference though in that as bad as Watergate was Nixon did not attempt a coup and Trump did and that’s a pretty big difference. ,eskimospy212,2025-05-05T15:09:46,1
Textualism is out?! Shit. I didn't get the Federalist Society memo on that one.,Grandpa_No,2025-05-05T17:51:57,2
For my money. It really was mainly Nixon and bush 43. Reagan and bush 41 did do some Shit but they didn’t get way with it compared To Nixon and bush 43. Seriously Abu ghraib makes. Trumps Salvadorean prison look like chump change. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T12:23:29,2
I’d look harder into Reagan. His administration is responsible for a ton of what we see going on around us today.,Many-Calligrapher914,2025-05-05T12:51:23,15
"""Reagan did do some shit""  Wow, what a wild underestimation of reagan's destructive legacy",SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-05T13:15:09,9
"Reagan's most corrosive impact was on conservative culture, turning it into a religious mafia style ""no one snitch"" environment with the 11th commandment, gaining the title Saint Reagan. From there, their ability to self regulate continually dwindled until we got this.",sporkhandsknifemouth,2025-05-05T14:49:37,5

It was destructive but Nixon did so much more than Reagan. And bush 43 expanded the police state so much more than Reagan.  Like people say Reagan sabotaged Iran hostage talks. Nixon was accused of doing that first in Vietnam. Lots of modern government corruption and overreach can be traced back to Nixon. And LBJ partially. ,Comprehensive_Main,2025-05-05T13:47:26,1
