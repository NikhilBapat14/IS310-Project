" Republicans are so tone deaf to everything, and everyone, around them.   Good for Sununu not running and taking part in the shit-show that is the Trump Circus.",Ayste,2025-04-10T10:08:57,19
"Smart enough to be a popular GOP governor who occasionally called out Trump for his stupidity, and smart enough to stay out of fed politics and avoid becoming a trump sycophant. Unusual for the GOP",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-10T13:40:18,1
"He wouldn't have won anyways. Look at Former two term Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan for example, he got Democratic swing voters to vote for him in a state level position as Governor, but in a federal position directly tied to Maga and Trump he lost. He didn't get Democratic support like he did as Governor, and MAGA wasn't motivated to vote for him either.  Voters in New England area states are willing to vote for Republicans in state government level positions, but not something like senator. If Susan Collins didn't have longtime incumbency advantage, and ran as a new GOP senator today she wouldn't win in Maine.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-10T10:34:27,13

"It would be closer in NH sure, but it still wouldn't be enough. A big reason why state government level Republicans are successful in New England, is because they can effectively separate themselves from Trump and Maga, and get Democratic swing voters.   You can't do the same as Senator, again that's what happened to Larry Hogan. He was the Anti Maga Republican Governor, but once he ran for Senate that didn't work anymore. Sununu would instantly lose his appeal to Democratic voters because a GOP senator has to support the GOP agenda federally. The whole ""I'm just here to support the state of New Hampshire, and I'm not MAGA guys"" schtick again doesn't work once you leave state level government.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-10T11:19:50,2
"In the last Presidential election, New Hampshire voted for Harris over Trump 50.65% to 47.87%, whereas Maryland was 62.62% to 34.08%. New Hampshire is just not as anti-Trump as Maryland.",WildMajesticUnicorn,2025-04-10T11:23:19,2
