Awesome!Â  Far too many of these judges sees to think that they get to pick & choose which laws are obeyed.,BoredAtWork1976,2025-04-25T11:26:31,10
"After reading more information about this case, the judge had no right to lead the illegal immigrant through back doors to evade ICE.  It's understandable to not let ICE to make arrests during a hearing, but it seems there was deception by the judge after the hearing was completed.   I don't know why the judge would defend this person, other than its an attempted power move against federal agents, which was done not in the best interest of public safety. They are illegal, and although they are accused of a crime and they did not get their due process for said crime yet, lets assume they are actually innocent, it doesn't negate the fact that they are illegal this country and can be deported.   I look forward to hearing more details about this judge's arrest.",ThrowawayMonster9384,2025-04-26T02:39:58,2
