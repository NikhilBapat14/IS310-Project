"Any one single - ANY ONE - who is a Trump voter, care to respond?  Pro-life, pro-family? Christian?  Would you care to make a defense of this inhumanity?",Mindless-Pogram,2025-04-27T05:25:37,27
"> Heidy Sánchez was held without any communication and flown to Cuba two days later. She is still breastfeeding her daughter, who suffers from seizures, her lawyer, Claudia Cañizares, said.  This is the ""enemy"" of the US that Trump is choosing to fight. This is where dehumanising a diverse group of ""the other"" gets you. I wonder if people actually performing these actions get to stop and think ""wtf is actually going on here"". But hey, one more immigrant and ""it's"" seizure ridden kid is out. Yay...",IDontGoHardIGoHome,2025-04-27T06:01:01,6

"We can deport anybody we want. The President, I mean excuse me, Der Fuhrer has complete power. Who's going to stop him, the legislative branch? The judiciary? We Rule the country, it's about time you folks understand that.",TopEagle4012,2025-04-27T05:38:02,2

"Let me guess, they are ALL narco-terrorists and needed to be shipped out immediately to save American lives, right?  No, just an undocumented mother to a U.S. citizen?  Maybe they could have stayed a bit.  I wish ICE would focus on actual criminals and not the ones just living their lives.",Andovars_Ghost,2025-04-27T23:19:35,1

It’s why they keep saying “criminal”.  Look how they are responding to the American judge the trump administration just arrested. “She was a criminal”  It’s propaganda straight from the Nazi playbook. Label them enemies of the state so it justifies their arrest or silence.,ACasualRead,2025-04-27T07:02:16,6
"I mean ones without undocumented parents. They will start on regular citizens soon. If he manages to revoke the 14th amendment, he will likely try and apply it retrospectively and even start talking about generations.",Shanghaichica,2025-04-27T13:43:24,2
"When Trump asks the president of El Salvador to build five new prisons, for homegrown criminals, this should be an a genuine moment of fear for anybody whose ever criticized him in social media, for journalists, for judges, because he’s accused all those things of being illegal in the past.",SaphironX,2025-04-27T16:38:56,3
