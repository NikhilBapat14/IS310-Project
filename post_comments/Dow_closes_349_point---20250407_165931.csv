only 350 pts ? how is that possible?   Trump threaten an additional 50% tariff on China tomorrow if China doesn't fold to his demands and China won't.,wizgset27,2025-04-07T17:03:10,1

"We had a phenomenonal day compared to the world markets; Nasdaq is even up +0.10%  It's repeated market manipulation; it'll recover 20%-40% then crash to a new low, repeat.   Just not sure why investors keep biting. That's 3 times and counting.",nerphurp,2025-04-07T17:09:16,1

There was no reason for Trump to destroy the markets and economy like this   Liberation Day should be known as Trumpcession Day,Fantastic_Team_6,2025-04-07T17:11:44,1

A rando on twitter sparked a morning rally with a lie that tariffs were being delayed for 90 days.,jmchao,2025-04-07T17:04:16,1
He doubled down on the China threats mere minutes before closing so the markets didn't have a lot of time to react.  ETA: But it's very entertaining watching his supporters try to spin closing a little in the red as some kind of win.,Subliminal_Kiddo,2025-04-07T17:16:43,1
The extra tariffs on China go into effect tomorrow at noon and recently Trump has been throwing shade on the EU zero tariffs deal with demands they won’t accept like ending the VAT tax. Tomorrow is the day to look out for.,DREWCAR89,2025-04-07T17:04:47,1

"Well, that rumor got out that there would be a pause on the tariffs   https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2025/04/07/trump-90-day-tariff-pause-rumor-causes-stock-whipsaw-before-white-house-calls-it-fake-news-heres-what-happened/  My guess is that a lot of Republicans who would finally caved into the fact that Trump is heading us towards disaster, chose to believe instead that maybe he is playing 3D chess.",raistlin65,2025-04-07T19:47:59,1
"Yes there was and still is. To threaten the entire world into financial submission (TBD if effective) and to serve his own personal financial interests, probably (who knows what back-channel dealings have been going on).  The reasons are as clear as day to me. I don’t buy that Trump is just a blithering idiot who doesn’t know what he’s doing. He’s an impulsive, evil man who serves his own personal interests and fantasies of power.",e76,2025-04-07T18:15:35,1
"Yeah, anyone reading this chain, this isn't a joke. This actually happened this morning.  Guy on Twitter said the tariffs were delayed and $3T was added to the stock market. Then it was debunked and it dropped $2.5T.   All of that happened within the span of like 30 minutes.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-07T17:41:01,1
"This is essentially it. A lot of people are still convinced deep down that he doesn't REALLY mean it, that he won't REALLY go through with it, and will cling desperately to any bit of hopium they can that indicates it, or so it seems.",The_Lost_Jedi,2025-04-07T19:02:06,1
It was revealed that it was a guy named Bloomberg who got a xitter checkmark and posted this rumor.. Some moron on air read the 'xeet' out loud... Hence the origin of the rumor lol   (fun 'unrelated' fact: 'x'is often pronounced as 'sh-' in mandarin...),DeusExMachina222,2025-04-07T18:24:40,1
"Sure, that happened. But shouldn't markets should have reacted and gone where it was supposed to go anyways. It isn't like without that fake news, the market would have gone down another 3 tril. This is just where it was always meant to be.",rsmicrotranx,2025-04-07T17:43:38,1
"It started out where we expected, it was over -1,000 before that tweet happened. The stock market isn't really science, it's more magic. A lot of things make no sense. But that tweet created a mass buy event which then led to people not wanting to sell in case it was going to go back up.  The expectation was that today was going to be another 1,000 point loss.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-07T17:47:05,1
