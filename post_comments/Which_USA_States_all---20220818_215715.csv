Presently none.  But the SCOTUS will take up. Case next session to address that.  It would set off a Constitutional crisis.,ArcherChase,2022-08-19T07:32:44,11
This is extremely dangerous.  What's the point of elections then if the voice of the people can just be overridden simply because the Governor doesn't like the results?  Democracy in the US would be dead.,Nearbyatom,2022-08-19T09:53:27,5
None. The states do not have this right. To suggest they do is completely wrong. States cannot choose if they want to accept an election. The point of an election is that it is binding. Throwing that away is to throw away the basic principle of our system.,mormagils,2022-08-19T10:28:25,2
"But we are fairly certain what the SC will decide, right?    Assuming they allow the state legislatures to send anyone they want, it will magically be states that are gerrymandered for the Republicans but who's popular vote was for Democrats.  Likely Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada...",not_that_planet,2022-08-19T11:04:27,2
"I think you may be confusing this with the independent legislature doctrine, which deals with re-districting.  There's no question that a state legislature can pass a law declaring that there will be no popular election for President and the legislature will appoint the electors themselves. That's how it was done in most states in the early days.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T21:17:08,1
"When you stop to think about it, this ""democracy is dead"" notion is how the overwhelming majority of democratic nations actually do it.  In a parliamentary system, you don't get to vote for the head of government at all. Instead, your elected representatives are the ones who vote.  Indeed, the U.S. would arguably be in a better place if we didn't have Presidential elections at all and the various state legislatures or governors simply appointed a slate of electors.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T12:56:16,1
There is nothing stopping any individual state from writing a law that permitted the legislature to pre-empt the result of the Presidential election. It's just that none have such a law in place right now.,ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T12:56:58,2
">But we are fairly certain what the SC will decide, right?  No, because there's a fairly wide range of what SCOTUS can decide in Moore v. Harper. To keep the status quo, SCOTUS can rule state constitutions and laws can dictate how federal elections take place, which allow courts to redraw districts.  To take a LITTLE power away from the states, SCOTUS can rule that ONLY the legislature can draw the maps. So while courts can say they are illegal, they can't redraw them and can only make the legislature to redraw maps.  To take more power from the states, SCOTUS can rule that only state legislatures can decide district maps and the state judicial and executive branches have no say (essentially state law and constitutions have no say on how to draw congressional districts).   To take even MORE power from the states, SCOTUS can rule ALL federal election rules/laws/procedures are decided by the state legislature in accordance with federal law. So funding, districts, rules and procedures for voting locations, counting votes, etc. all are decided solely by the legislature not subject to the judiciary or executive branches of the state.  Where they will fall on that scale is unknown. I think the extremes are unlikely, but anything in-between is fair game.",ProLifePanda,2022-08-19T14:16:58,2
"Bzzt.  Independent legislature theory is about all facets of electoral law, of which redistricting is just one part. Explicitly it is about how far state legislatures can go in controlling the voting process and restrict elections. Here’s an explanation: https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained  So the SC case has profound precedent in terms of many other things. Not just redistricting.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-20T08:05:55,1
">Indeed, the U.S. would arguably be in a better place if we didn't have Presidential elections at all and the various state legislatures or governors simply appointed a slate of electors.  I can’t even fathom the sheer naïveté it takes to write this. There’s a reason that system was discarded - it makes zero sense in a system where the voting franchise has finally expanded to all American citizens. It would ‘arguably’ be better only if you like riots in the street and an authoritarian system.   Also, not how parliamentary systems work. At all. The head of state always has an element of popular will behind them.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-20T08:08:24,3
"Honestly, I'm not sure how allowing presidential electors to be chosen by state legislatures or governors would make the US a better place. In the current environment it would only serve to entrench minority rule. I don't even think it would make the US more in line with parliamentary systems  In most parliamentary systems political parties choose a party leader to lead them in election campaigns, represent them in national televised debates, and serve as their country's prime minister if their party wins a majority in parliament.   I can't think of any parliamentary democracy in the world where the prime minister doesn't represent a party or coalition that received the majority, or at least a plurality, of the vote at a national election. Even in the UK, with their first past the post system, the Conservative still received more votes than any other party in 2019.  Allowing state legislators to choose presidential electors significantly raises the chance of a president assuming office without even the support of a plurality in the electorate. I don't think that would make the US a better place.",PaleontologistOk7794,2022-08-20T07:59:45,2
"Yes, there very much is. The states are not allowed to just decide who win the election. That's not how it works. If you think there is legal basis for that kind of law then you need to go back to law school.",mormagils,2022-08-19T13:03:10,2
"Independent legislature theory isn't relevant to the question. It deals with whether the legislature can act alone - without the normal process of lawmaking and review including other branches of state government - rather than the power to appoint electors.  Even if the Independent Legislature doctrine was viewed favorably by the Supreme Court, it still wouldn't grant states to power to do what the original question asks because the Supreme Court has long ruled that election rules must be in place well before the election and cannot be changed on the fly.  Regardless of the outcome of the decision on the Independent Legislature Doctrine, states can still implement procedures that eliminate the popular vote for President in favor of legislative appointment if they so choose. The only relevance of ILD would be whether they could pass such a law without the assent of the governor and review of state courts.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-20T08:22:21,1
"> There’s a reason that system was discarded - it makes zero sense in a system where the voting franchise has finally expanded to all American citizens.  Given that the system was discarded long before the voting franchise was expanded to all American citizens, it should be obvious that this wasn't the reason.  > The head of state always has an element of popular will behind them.  In a parliamentary system, the members of parliament vote. In what I suggested, the states (either via legislature or governor) would vote. The only real difference would be that you have a smaller number of districts voting and there's no vote of no confidence option.  Even then, such a system would just as likely split electoral votes within a state rather than sending an entire slate of electors to the party with a bare majority - and that would eliminate the granularity issue of fewer districts.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-20T08:17:48,1
"> Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.  State legislatures are not required to hold a Presidential election *at all*. They could simply hold a floor vote to appoint electors instead if they so chose.  Don't confuse custom with law.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T13:25:41,5
">It deals with whether the legislature can act alone - without the normal process of lawmaking and review including other branches of state government - rather than the power to appoint electors.  You're about half-right.  The Independent Legislature Theory was explicitly formulated to make the legal argument for tossing away electors a legislature doesn't like and putting up a separate slate that disregards the will of voters: it's a cynical exploitation of clauses in the constitution related to elections and the Electoral Count Act. [Here's a conservative jurist explaining what the theory leads to in practice,](https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/opinions/gop-blueprint-to-steal-the-2024-election-luttig/index.html) and [here's an explanation of how the Independent Legislature Theory goes beyond redistricting.](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained) It's an all-encompassing extremist legal theory that can lead to multiple outcomes beyond redistricting, replacing popularly chosen electors, voter disenfranchisement, etcetera, etcetera.  Calling it a theory about 'how the legislature can act alone' is just disingenuous. It's a legal argument for a power-grab, which can lead to exactly what OP is asking about. Therefore, it's perfectly relevant to bring up.   Hope that helps.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-20T13:07:15,1
">Given that the system was discarded long before the voting franchise was expanded to all American citizens, it should be obvious that this wasn't the reason.  Missing the point. It's impossible to go back to that system now that the franchise has been widened. Try putting that cat back in the bag, and see how it works. Again: just pure naivete. People prefer to have their say.   >In what I suggested, the states (either via legislature or governor) would vote.  Were any states not gerrymandered, that could be workable, but sadly that era has long passed, so that system of choosing electors is obsolete. In the modern day that simply turns into pure disenfranchisement of voters who are not of the governor or legislature majority's party.  That's heinously inefficient - and not how parliamentary systems are designed or intended to work. You're describing something more akin to what the Chinese Communist Party's Consultative Congress does, where a few elites select one of their own to represent their local party at a national congress, without anyone living in their area actually having much say on who that one person is. Needless to say it's rife with corruption.   Again: yes, the legislatures could choose to replace electors tomorrow if they so chose. But it isn't arguable that that's a terrible idea, and anyone who thinks so is just childishly ignorant of the consequences. Best to simply continue letting the popular vote determine electors. It's not as if there isn't already an element of disenfranchisement, anyway: no need to make it worse.",dunpyklungo,2022-08-20T13:15:44,1
"So just to be clear, your reading is that the Constitution does not require elections. That if we chose to simply appoint a president through state legislatures that Constitution does not prohibit that?

"The entire article is a discussion of the elections clause.  For the first few decades of the U.S., state legislatures directly choosing the electors without popular election was how most states did it. The transition to popular elections was not due to a change in how the Constitution works, but a gradual change in how state legislatures implemented the system. They could just as easily switch back.  If you don't know, don't guess.",ViskerRatio,2022-08-19T13:41:36,3
"Dude, I'm not going to argue with you, especially when you're not providing sources to back up your interpretation of this clause. It's simply not correct to say that elections are optional. If you want to prove it is, go for it! Good luck.  EDIT: No, the states did not just choose electors however they wanted. They were connected to the election results and then appointed through the electoral college process. This an absolute insane reading of history and the law.",mormagils,2022-08-19T13:43:32,1
"I did provide a source - the Constitution of the U.S. Unlike the source you provided, I actually referenced the correct part.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College  > In 1789, the at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland. Massachusetts, Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and state legislatures chose in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina).[65][failed verification] New York, North Carolina and Rhode Island did not participate in the election.
