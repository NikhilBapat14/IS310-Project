What fight? California has in the most recent 40 years done its own thing. No one has declared war against California. But Newsom is awful...has this guy done anything but be the epitome of a Clinton and do polling before giving a speech as to know what to say?,cheff546,2025-04-25T08:22:06,3
"Excerpt:  *Three months into President Donald Trump’s second term and the recovery from the firestorm that devastated Los Angeles, Gov. Gavin Newsom finds himself at a precarious juncture.*  *The olive branch that Newsom extended to Trump in January, as Los Angeles reeled from multiple fires and the president threatened to withhold disaster aid, has yet to deliver on its early promise.*  *Once a leading voice in the anti-Trump resistance, Newsom traveled to Los Angeles and then Washington, D.C. to meet with the president and lobby for federal assistance. Trump rewarded his outreach with a détente — ceasing reference to the governor as “Newscum” and publicly promising that an “L.A. fire fix” was coming.*  *But amid ongoing battles over government funding, Congress has to date ignored Newsom’s request for $40 billion to rebuild Los Angeles.*  *Meanwhile, new political pressures are mounting. Increasingly furious with Trump’s dismantling of the federal government, Democratic voters are agitating their leaders to speak out — and even Newsom can no longer hold his tongue.*  *He made his most pointed criticism of the president’s agenda since before the fires when he sued last week to stop Trump’s sweeping tariffs scheme, calling it the “poster child” of stupidity. It appears to have unleashed Newsom’s confrontational side again, in a semi-profane announcement of another lawsuit to stop cuts to AmeriCorps and a commentary blasting the Trump administration for defying court orders that followed in the days after.*  *The stakes are incredibly high, not only for the future of Los Angeles but also for his gubernatorial legacy.*  ...  *The governor said he’s continuing to work behind the scenes to maintain his connection with Trump. His team gave the White House a heads up about the tariffs lawsuit, which Newsom said was intended as a gesture of respect, and he is planning another trip to Washington.*  *As he leans anew into the opposition, Newsom is also training his ire on the Trump administration while largely avoiding mentioning Trump himself.*  *But Newsom said the tariffs, which his office has referred to as DEFCON 2 because of their potential to upend California’s entire economy, represent the type of threat that reaches a level that compels the governor to respond.*  *“It’s not personal. But it’s very important that we assert ourselves. And people are looking to us to lead,” he said. “It’s important we have people’s backs.”*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-25T08:21:55,1
