It’s still hard to believe the levers of global trade are in the tiny hands of a second rate reality TV personality.,direwolf71,2025-05-06T17:16:59,15
If you're not signing deals (after claiming you're getting deals signed with countries) then what's the point?   What happened to those 200 trade deals a week ago?  >Time: Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them?  >Trump: I’ve made 200 deals.    >Time: You’ve made 200 deals?  >Trump: 100%.  https://time.com/7280114/donald-trump-2025-interview-transcript/,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-06T17:00:07,27

"Trump: ""We don't have to sign any deals.""  Unwritten, but implied by Trump (*and not understood by the New York Times*): ""Americans can just suffer through a trade war against the entire world for as long as I'm President.""  \---  How the hell can reporters be so incapable of understanding the corollary to a statement?!?",Joadzilla,2025-05-06T17:14:57,5

">“I think my people haven’t made it clear, we will sign some deals,” said Trump. “But much bigger than that is we’re going to put down the price that people are going to have to pay to shop in the United States. Think of us as a super luxury store, a store that has the goods.”  U.S. markets moved lower Tuesday afternoon after Trump made the comments about deals.<  This is the man that’s been entrusted to run our country for the next four years.",Worried_Substance141,2025-05-06T17:32:11,3
"So no deals, no leverage. World teabagged him at every one of his deal attempts.   An interesting scenario is shaping up:  If the Trump administration is wrong about tariffs, will they concede that and minimize the supply chain disruptions and inflation effects?   Keep in mind that Republicans have operated since 2005 with the unwritten motto that they don't make mistakes, they don't apologize, and they don't change course.",localistand,2025-05-06T17:00:41,2

I mean you promised 90 deals in 90 days   So...you kinda do?   Or I mean...we could just say screw the tariffs and rebuild our trade relationships with our allies that would be pretty cool   Your approval would probably rebound 3-5 points instantly and we wouldn't have a period of time resulting in stock shortages,blues111,2025-05-06T17:07:03,1

"But but he wrote a book (that he didn't actually write himself) about how great he was at making deals. Because if he says he's good at it, it must be true. Part of the issue is as a society too many people have bought into the bullshit that wealth is a product of merit, and that being good at gaining wealth is a sign of intelligence and not just luck (especially luck in being born to a privilidged family with good connection). The rich use the very fact that they're rich as proof that they must deserve their wealth, and idiots buy into that because they also have inflated egos and believe they're special too, and thus will someday join the ranks of the ultrawealthy (they won't)",Ill_Act_1855,2025-05-06T23:18:07,2

"I do think there’s a good chance you’re right (it’s the most logical answer), but as time goes on I start to believe more and more that he’s just extremely incompetent to the point that even corruption like that for personal gain is beyond his intellect. Him being so adamant about the MS13 subtitles/photoshop image in his ABC interview really confirmed to me how stupid he is.  I think there were enough people with some basis in reality and expertise in their fields to steer the ship well enough in his first term. This time around, it appears to be sycophantic yes-men only who either go along with his ideas because they want to appease him, or who are just using him as a puppet for their own agendas (like project 25, all the EO’s he signs while not knowing what’s even written in them). I think for Trump, it’s mostly about what *sounds* or *feels* good in the moment as he’s told something by someone around him.",NightwolfGG,2025-05-06T17:16:13,21

"I agree with this 100%. He still managed to say and do some stupid shit last term.   The media has and continues to translate his idiocy into real thoughts and real policy.   He’s obviously not some smart, savvy businessman but he also isn’t an evil genius.   He is evil because he is so selfish and attention seeking that all of the stuff he does comes from conflicting viewpoints that’s why it’s all so chaotic. It’s whoever sucked up to him or told him what he wanted to hear last whether that’s Fox News or his Cabinet and he’s dumb enough to believe anything he is told.   Stupid. Incompetent. And maybe dementia?",loadsoftoadz,2025-05-06T17:47:22,8
"> media has and continues to translate his idiocy into real thoughts and real policy  All true. And all the while the media chases the elusive rationale for trump's actions, they typically miss the point: there is no political, economic strategic, etc, rationale outside of what keeps trump's bubble of grandiosity over inflated. THat's it! It is not too far off the mark to assume his envy-hatred of the thriving economy Biden left him, is what has motivated him to wreck it. Narcissists must destroy what they envy.",snarquisnarquer,2025-05-06T18:45:18,2
