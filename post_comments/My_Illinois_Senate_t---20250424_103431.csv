"Tier 1: Pritzker - if he's in, that's the primary. I highly doubt he'll leave the governorship (plus I bet he's got at least one eye on 28), but if he does, he's the next Senator  Tier 2: Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-8) - probably the frontrunner now. Won the 8th in 2016 and has cleaned up ever since. Can fundraise his ass off and has 19 million sitting in his war-chest. If he doesn't run, I'll be shocked.  Lauren Underwood (IL-14) - number two behind Raja rn. Super qualified and worked in Obama's HHS before entering politics, where she won Hastert's old seat and hasn't looked back. Very young too (she's only 38) so if she gets elected, she's gonna be in that seat for a long time  Tier 3: Juliana Stratton - the current Lt. Gov. Not bad, but relatively unknown, so compared to Krishnamoorthi or Underwood, she might struggle to get market share. She does, however, have the ace in the hole. JB Pritzker. If he directs his cash/endorsement his way, she's got a fighting shot.  Robin Kelly (IL-2) - Congresswoman since 2013. Won a super crowded special election primary in 2013, and has won her district by pretty safe margins ever since. Wouldn't be bad, but much like Stratton has name recognition problems. She'd need some money/endorsements to get her up there.  Everyone else:  Mike Frerichs (Treasurer) - nice guy! But again, name rec problems and compared to everyone above will struggle  Alexi Giannoulias (SOS) - dude has run everywhere for every position. I just don't see him getting a foothold to where it'd be good for him long-term  Rahm Emanuel - No. Please, God no.",milin85,2025-04-24T10:46:41,1
