"I think there would not be a majority leader until the seat is filled. If there is a tie in the house, the bill dies.  No tie breaking.",moochir,2022-11-17T13:26:03,9
"There's no tie breaker in the house.  If the speaker holds a vote when they know it's going to be a tie, they're an idiot.",limbodog,2022-11-17T15:45:06,4
"I believe there are 435 seats, no way for a tie at this point. But good question as at some point it may be an issue, and I don't remember it ever being covered in college, or school for that matter.",dstang67,2022-11-17T17:12:30,3
"Vacancies count for the party they were elected by for majority purposes. Obviously the majority would be a paper tiger in that actually trying to do anything with that majority would  be likely to fail (assuming 100% party loyalty and attendance on both sides), but the majority leader wouldn't change until the vacancy was filled with someone from the other party.",mormagils,2022-11-18T09:09:58,3

"This is not a Constitutional issue, and I don't think that it's a statutory issue, so it's probably an issue of House rules.  These are available online.",Tetepupukaka53,2022-11-27T06:30:35,1

">I believe there are 435 seats, no way for a tie at this point.  If you read the OP, they explicitly ask in the case of a vacancy. So if the GOP wins 218-217 and one of them dies, the House is 217-217. So they're asking what happens in that scenario.",ProLifePanda,2022-11-19T21:46:22,3
"I don't think that's the case.  The Speaker of the House gets a vote, but that's counted among the normal total.  So they're part of the tie that needs to be broken.  In the Senate, the VPOTUS can break a tie, but does not normally vote.  The House has no such person.",limbodog,2022-11-18T17:29:23,3
