It’s all been said before but every one of these women’s stories after the bans are so sad and desperate,aqsgames,2025-04-30T16:41:37,7
"It should be said again and again.   People that have been born already die for no good reason when a fetus has more protections than that of the mother. Pro-birthers aren’t pro-life and there’s plenty of proof. They’d rather women die than be able to receive healthcare.   The Roe v wade decision wasn’t reached because people like killing fetuses and babies, it was reached because providing healthcare is less harmful than outlawing it. Pro birthers don’t care about life, and criminalizing abortions and healthcare is proof.",Honest-Ad1675,2025-05-01T01:44:11,4
