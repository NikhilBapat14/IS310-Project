yes they want violence they are trying to provoke it so they cam bring in the military. the problem is even if citizens behave they will stage violence using plainclothes people. dont know when but this will happen to keep trump in power at the end of his term . they are already getting rid of generals and putting their own people in place.,rocco888,2025-05-09T13:25:35,5

Go to the right places and protest in a way that scares the hell out of Republicans and really gets Trump's attention.
