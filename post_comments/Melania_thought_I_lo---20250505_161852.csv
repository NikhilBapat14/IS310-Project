"President Trump has said his wife Melania thought he looked ‚Äúcute‚Äù in an AI-generated image of him dressed in papal vestments.  Trump posted the image on his Truth Social account on Friday, less than a week after Pope Francis‚Äôs funeral in Rome, drawing criticism from some Catholics. The White House‚Äôs social media accounts also reposted it.  Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump said that he had only become aware of the picture on Sunday evening and denied any involvement in creating it.  When a reporter suggested that some Catholics were offended, Trump interrupted: ‚ÄúOh, they can‚Äôt take a joke,‚Äù going on to criticise the ‚Äúfake news media‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI had nothing to do with it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not me that did it.‚Äù He¬†added that the first lady ‚Äúthought it was cute‚Äù",TimesandSundayTimes,2025-05-05T16:19:24,7
