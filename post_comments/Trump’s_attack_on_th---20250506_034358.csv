He raised a stink when “Parasite” won the Oscar for Best Screenplay at the end of his first term. He made some comment about how Oscars should only go to American movies. I’m sure his supporters also agree. They’re reflexively threatened by anything that encroaches on their historical dominance of American culture. ,Sharp_Blueberry_6547,2025-05-06T04:11:49,14
">For so many people, movies will be their first exposure to any number of other places and people, which at their best can play a role in what Roger Ebert described as an empathy-generating machine.  >That’s why Trump’s vaguely but forcefully worded announcement trades on a bit of fashionable xenophobia, too, implying that movies shot in other places – US-produced or not – carry dangerous levels of propaganda. Propaganda about what? Why, the idea that a world outside American serfs toiling at the behest of corner-cutting billionaires exists at all. For Trump, other countries are not objects of cultural fascination or curiosity. They’re enemy combatants who need to be vanquished and looted by American exceptionalism. It’s a simple-mindedness that many people grow out of – sometimes with the help of exposure to the arts. No wonder the president treats all forms of them with such contempt.",Eat_the_Rich1789,2025-05-06T03:44:13,5
"This America first stuff plays well to his MAGA base, but you have to remember that this Orange Cheeto POS only cares about one thing, and that's the color green as in dollars. If tomorrow someone would give him $100 billion to make movies overseas, that would be the new protocol. This is another one of those Let's Open Alcatraz distractions while he continues to bilk the treasury, close down necessary government organizations to protect people, and figure out ways with his sycophants to steal from the American public.",TopEagle4012,2025-05-06T04:41:24,4
"It's a very interesting interpretation and precedent that intellectual property recorded in other countries, which is video footage, can fall under the umbrella of tariffs. The good itself and the distribution could very possibly have no financial connection to that country beyond its production. It is instead is owned by private holders, who may have sold/licensed their rights to the intellectual property to American distributors and it may never have even a foreign-owned asset from the get-go. What about intellectual properties like paintings from another country, sold to an American art collector who views or licenses art in magazines?   Once that intellectual property is complete and potentially available to the highest bidder or held by a holding company, there is no continued exchange of goods or with a country that has been tariffed. Unless, of course, there is some kind of share (3% of sales goes to that countries' museum or local tourist department.) In the case of sanctions, it does make sense given they are generating economic activity in that country.. but in the case of tariffs it's a professionally recorded performance that becomes intellectual property. That does not generate the foreign country any measurable or hard financial activity once the movie has been recorded. Plus, the financial activity itself on things such as jobsites or to rent equipment never fell under American domestic tax code in the first place.   What about commercials recorded in other countries? Stock images photographed in other countries owned by American holding companies? *What about videos & photographs from travel agencies and hotels that are recorded in travel destinations and used to generate real hard goods such as booked travel?* Sports broadcasts (F1, international tournaments, soccer matches, etc.,)?",postsshortcomments,2025-05-06T04:10:50,2
"Start with a lack of understanding about the industry as a whole. And taking Jon Voight's advice for anything. And not getting that the completed film is digitally transmitted via drag-n-drop after US rights are acquired, and not imported because you're effectively not buying a product, but a service, which is out of scope for tariffs.",steve_ample,2025-05-06T07:29:14,2
"I wouldn't be surprised. He's always had a thing against anything that isn't ""American first."" It's like he can't stand the idea of other cultures having any influence here.",ProudSexyLady,2025-05-06T05:11:12,1

Next he will demand films include the reinforcement of ‘American Ideals’ which is code for Fascist reinforcement of enemies and the restrictions of free thought. It’s an old playbook.,jimmygee2,2025-05-06T09:46:43,5
