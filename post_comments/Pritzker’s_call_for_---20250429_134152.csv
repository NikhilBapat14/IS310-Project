The only way to reach them is to give them any other sense of belonging or connect to the hole in their soul and lack of real love for their own autonomy they feel that drives them to derive meaning from following an external authority rather than connecting to their own internal authority.   A lot of it is just loneliness and existential dread about mortality ",thirdeyepdx,2025-04-29T21:01:44,3
