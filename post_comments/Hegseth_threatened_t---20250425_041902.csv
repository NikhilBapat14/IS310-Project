I recently started watching The MeidasTouch Network (plug) and they show a lot of clips from Fox News.  I could not believe the amount of BS they sling around.

Any government requiring polygraph testing is a government run by clowns.   They are not real science.   Polygraphs are intimidation and intimidation only.

"For postings and during assorted trainings, I‚Äôve seen TS/SCI with polygraph and TS/SCI without polygraph (but the latter doesn‚Äôt say without poly, just reads TS/SCI standalone).  Is it possible that TS/SCI covers receiving information (briefs, movements, etc.) and the polygraph comes in for those handling that data or have hands on the equipment?  Based on my work, a lot of the engineers have polygraphs. But I‚Äôm (almost) certain some of the TS/SCI attorneys, for example, don‚Äôt.  The engineers are working on/with TS/SCI ‚Äústuff‚Äù a lot of the time, while the attorneys have it more as a just in case (pun not intended‚Ä¶ you know, attorneys‚Ä¶ case, ha).  Of course I‚Äôm not in everyone‚Äôs business with their clearance process, so maybe I‚Äôm incorrect.
