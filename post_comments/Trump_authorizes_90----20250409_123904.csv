I get both Medicare and Medicaid so I have no out of pocket costs but I am in an Advantage plan so they could drop them from the formulary. I already have to get a prior authorization for the Ozempic. Oddly enough my diabetes educator originally tried to get me on Mounjaro because she didn't think they'd cover Ozempic.

"It's not just about tariffs. Honestly, we in the EU aren’t broke — we could handle trade tensions without too much trouble. What really matters is the lack of respect: the threats of taking land, the friendship with Russia, and the disrespect shown to war victims. Ukraine isn’t just fighting for itself — it’s standing up for the idea of a free world.  But you can’t just show up in Greenland, send people there, and expect us to stay quiet — and for what? Rare earths? You could’ve just asked. Denmark has said many times — we’re open to talking.  Instead, we’re being insulted by someone who wears eyeliner and calls us freeloaders — while trying to take land that belonged to us long before the U.S. even existed.  If Americans were in our place, I wonder how they’d react?  We’ve been on the edge of a world war. And yes, there's a big ocean between us — maybe that’s why some people in the U.S. don’t seem to care that this same man stopped actions against Russian cyberattacks, leaving Europe wide open to whatever Russia throws at us. The only one who stood firm was the man who showed up just as he is — no big show, just strength. But they kicked him out because he wasn't wearing a suit. In a plain set up.   Sorry for the long rant, but waking up and hearing that Russian planes flew over your head while you were sleeping (and I’m in Germany) doesn’t exactly feel great. Or seeing German tourists taken hostage by a puppy killer. That’s not a good start to the day.  Then we hear our own government telling LGBTQ+ people not to even go near the U.S. — that says a lot.  This is the world we’re living in now.

"This could be.  Buying the dip is standard advice, so I am sure there was some amount of insider trading somewhere. But, this also assumes that Trump, or someone else close to Trump, communicated the plan.  This also assumes that there was a plan.  If this was a market manipulation, insider trading, etc. it only makes sense if the rebound is long-term.  They would've also had to have bought at the right time, and in enough volume to pump the market. But, they risk creating a bubble. The bottom line is that this is not really a sustainable strategy and can still at this point result in a net loss overall.  So.... the insider trading angle could make sense if the goal is short-term gains.  But in the long run, for long-term gains, this is a really stupid strategy.  The pump and dump works really well for crypto and individual stocks, but not really for the entire market.  A lot of traders use algorithms to time buys down to the millisecond.  As soon as Trump announced pausing tariffs and lowering caps to 10%, except for China, was the 0.001 second when computers began buying followed by humans catching on a little bit later. You know, there are gamers and shit, right?  Well, there is trader version of this where people literally watch screens for hours observing market movements.
