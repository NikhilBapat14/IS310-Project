"It's all about punishing agencies and people that actually helped people.  And it's about conveying the false message that they're trying to offset the upcoming $5 trillion tax cut for the rich.    In either case, this is evil shit and if there's a fair election in 26, I hope the voters remember.",deltalitprof,2025-04-25T21:41:56,7

"Well, states that overwhelmingly voted for him might feel this effect, and so might some that do not approve the current administration. But regardless, we help our fellow Americans and we are better than this administration.  Balkanizing America over federal relief disaster aid isn’t going to happen.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T21:40:09,7

"The Gulf coast GOP voters (and non-voters) are going to have their “faces eaten” by the puppet-masters’ of this administration.

"Wow Texas , Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida are going to have a real hard time this hurricane season.",8bitmorals,2025-04-25T23:43:00,3
Where's the rational in that? He won't help other countries besides Israel and now he won't even help his own people when they need it the most. I guess it's all good as long as billionaires will get $5+ trillion in tax cuts.,invalidpassword,2025-04-26T05:27:33,3
"Listen, if you are in Florida or any other regressive state, get out. Get out now.  I don't want to hear ""I can't."" Your ancestors left where ever they were from with sometimes nothing but the clothes on their backs. You can too.   Do it before you can't.",awildstoryteller,2025-04-25T22:04:46,6
