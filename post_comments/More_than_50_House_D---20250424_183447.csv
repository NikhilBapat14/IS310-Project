"They're referring to the starlink Russia login, correct? That incident can't go away. It's evidence that Musk or someone directed by him or the president clearly left the door open for Russia to access our stuff.",BLU3SKU1L,2025-04-25T05:07:41,65

"So this letter, how exactly is this supposed to work?

"Trump, DOGE, and their ""shareholders"" looted the federal coffers and we'll be trying to piece together the crimes for generations. We may never even discover the full extent of their actions, because the people and institutions with the capability to do so will cease to exist.",jkvincent,2025-04-25T09:04:08,2

"Don‚Äôt worry the republicans will get to the bottom of it and make sure that whistleblower pays dearly. Just like they are going after the people who exposed Hegseth‚Äôs leaking military secrets. The party of lie, deny, and defy.",LeatEd68,2025-04-25T21:43:06,1

It‚Äôs the smoking gun. There is no other explanation. Russia was given login details so it could access state secrets.,gotfanarya,2025-04-25T06:17:09,40
"Typically it's because the ones who sit on committees with oversight into the issues will sign on to letters like this because they're most likely to be able to convince the Republicans on those committees to do something, and the only the GOP can do anything about it since they're in the majority.",atreeismissing,2025-04-24T23:21:21,38

"That's called conservatism, and the entire GOP has been conservative for a long time.
