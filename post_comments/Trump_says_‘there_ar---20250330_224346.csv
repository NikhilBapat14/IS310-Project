"Trump getting a 3rd term has to be a breaking point for the USA. It shouldn‚Äôt even be a question of concern. We don‚Äôt have kings or queens, period.

I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs exactly what they are after; to rebuild the USA from the ground up. It‚Äôs literally up to the American people to avoid a power vaccum to occur to allow Trump to be installed or to remove him from office to elect a new President. If our government fails us, there is no one else to turn to except for other countries welcoming us with refugee visas.
