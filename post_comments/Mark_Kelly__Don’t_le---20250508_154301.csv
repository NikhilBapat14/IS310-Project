I don’t listen to Faux News. Are they really spinning it that wildly! /s,GaryOoOoO,2025-05-08T16:24:50,3
"I love how they only put part of what Trump is doing. Even my 15-year-old kid sees this. He doesn't understand why people are pissed at the Tariffs and not at those who allowed this to happen. He wants to know (I haven't seen anything), how is Trump going to make sure this crap with the Tariffs never happens again.   My kid even knows that the rich will keep getting richer. If we don't give them the tax cuts, they will take their businesses elsewhere. If the businesses go elsewhere unemployment will happen. He also has not cut Medicaid but did say thee will try to cut fraud (have fun with the one), and work requirements.      FYI: Buy American (which I almost always do), and you won't be paying Tariffs.      I think we were all surprised at the stuff DOGE had found. DO I believe everything said about what they have found. Well, no. Was I surprise about the Biden administration stealing money from FEMA to give to NY for reimbursement of housing illegal immigrants. That should never have happened, especially with multiple states suffering from Milton and Helene. I am happy they were able to stop the payment.",WestLow880,2025-05-08T16:49:44,-1
"You know nothing DOGE “found” was true, right? Everything they supposedly discovered served only to make Elon richer. Hence why he cancelled some huge contracts with NASA but made sure to keep his own SpaceX contract in place.  I genuinely don’t understand how you can believe a word anyone in this administration is saying. It’s lie after lie. The FEMA aid was a complete and total lie, that was a separate aid package not related to hurricane aid in any way, the amount of cuts were a lie, the “benefits” they said Americans would receive from cutting all of these essential programs like education, teaching grants, contracts and much more were all lies.   Now we have a hostile and crippled education department that serves only to threaten schools for being too “woke”, thousands of unemployed Americans that lost their jobs, decreased national security, and a whole host of incompetent billionaires, fascists, and Fox News hosts running the government.",LeadSky,2025-05-08T20:58:14,3
