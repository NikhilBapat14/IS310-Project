"Do you mean supplement or supplant?  Duverger's Law says we should expect only two major parties in a system like in the UK or Canada. A party on the outside, therefore, has two discrete paths it can take: it can seek to replace one of the big two by moving closer to the centre, and broadening its coalition, or it can maintain a more extreme position and apply pressure on the major party closest to it. Conversely, the major parties also have two paths: to co-opt ideas that become popular and championed by the ideological flanks, or risk being replaced by said champion.  In the UK, the Liberals were basically supplanted by the Conservatives, who adopted many liberal positions. In Canada, the forerunner of the NDP put pressure on the Liberals to move left and build a welfare state—and they did. Canada's Liberals are not ideological liberals, they are always oriented around the political centre, whereas the Liberals in the UK during the Great War and afterward were not quite so flexible or effective.",Cleomenes_of_Sparta,2023-07-23T17:57:48,2
"This isn’t really a “law” but more like… an observed tendency in 3 particular English or former English commonwealth countries (UK, US, Canada). If you actually apply it to Englands former territories, it doesn’t really hold up to data analyses well which tells us there’s probably more underlying social phenomena at play than simply some iron law of the two party system. Some have refined the hypothesis to single member plurality districts, which does show a stronger correlation. But again, the biggest counter point to this is India, the worlds largest democracy currently and an English commonwealth country that has not tended towards any form of two-party politics. Similar things can be said for much of Englands former colonies, where the two-party system is far less pre-dominant. It might be a bug, not a feature.",ITrulyWantToDie,2023-07-31T05:47:17,2
