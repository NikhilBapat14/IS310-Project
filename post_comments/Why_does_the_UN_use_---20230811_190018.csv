"So the UN has 6 official languages. English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese.  A nation's formal name is translated at the UN into all 6 of those languages.   So. For example, Germany is officially Germany in the English language, Allemagne in French, Германия in Russian, Alemania in Spanish, and 会员国 in Chinese. (The UN's website isn't translated to Arabic. But Germany has an Arabic translation too.)   All versions of this name are equally correct. None of the languages have formal priority over the other. So it's actually not correct to say that the UN uses Germany. At least, not exclusively.  As to why Germany is called Germany and not Deutschland? Because German is not a UN language. And in English, which is a UN language, the nation is known as Germany. That is the correct translation. And these translations can be decided by the country in question. Germany could request to the UN that its English translation be Deutschland. In fact, it could request that all 6 of the UN languages translate to Deutschland. But the German government has chosen not to do this as of now.  So. Basically. Germany is called Germany in the English translation of its name because the Germans are cool with that. Meanwhile, calling the country by its 5 other translated names is also entirely correct.",omgwouldyou,2023-08-21T00:09:32,4
"English is the language of the world. spoken in some regard within all UN countries, unlike their native languages.",TalentedThots,2023-10-01T17:15:40,1
"Thank you for the explanation.   To make sure I got it correct, the UN uses the exonym used by each of the 6 official languages. If specifically requested by the nation, then the UN name will be changed to their actual countries name.  On a random tangent: They are exonyms, not translations. You do not translate a proper noun. Jaime is not translated to Jamie. It is mispronounced and then given a fancy word as justification, rather than admitting ignorance of pronunciation or culture by foreigners",N0w3rds,2023-08-21T11:33:56,3
"1. Yep. You got it.  2. They are both exonyms and translations. The definitions aren't mutually exclusive. To translate is ""the process of reworking text from one language into another to maintain the original message and communication."" Proper nouns absolutely can be translated, we often just don't because it can confuse the meaning rather than clarify it. But going around and calling Germany Germany in French, for example, would harm the meaning of the communication. So we translate it from English into French as Allemagne.   3. The orgins of the word Germany isn't rooted in misprouncation. The word Germany comes from the Latin name for the area - Germania. Deutschland comes from a now outdated word diutisc, which is a word meaning ""of the people."" They have different orgins and don't express any ignorance. I know you weren't making that exact claim. But I wanted to demonstrate that the difference in proper nouns for countries often isn't rooted in misprouncation or ignorance. (Though it sometimes it.) It's often rooted in different historical orgins.  Also, sorry. Missed your message for quite a long time.",omgwouldyou,2023-09-08T00:25:05,2
