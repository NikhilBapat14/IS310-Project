"Can’t make this stuff up….anymore. Yesterday it was Amazon working with China and Bezos is a China Spy. Dude threw a wrench into the economy with tariffs expecting a big boom on liberation day and that US will be rich, when riches didn’t come, all issues are Biden fault moving forward? Something is telling me, they broke something and will try to hide the collapse of the economy.",Rare_Advantage5859,2025-04-30T08:22:47,23

The same Biden that saved the economy from his disastrous first term and mishandling of Covid which led to high inflation? That Biden?,MatrimCauthon95,2025-04-30T08:30:53,4
"Jesus, for a guy who won a second term, has implemented all his economic dream policies... he really loves to blame the man who basically slept through his entire presidency",Aggravating_Rise_179,2025-04-30T08:23:20,9

Articles like this are a huge part of the problem. They just act like a PR department and repeat what Trump said without adding context or any fact checking.,PeterVenkmanIII,2025-04-30T08:38:57,5

Growth/the Trump stock market will actually start as soon as the next democrat is elected and stocks improve.,VanguardAvenger,2025-04-30T09:01:42,2
"“Growth will take a while…to return”  We had growth…2.6% I believe, until this quarter, where it reversed to a reduction. Blaming Biden when polls are killing him is peek Trump because that’ll just make it worse.",Saber-Rattler-3448,2025-04-30T09:34:31,2
This is just for his cult. The explanation doesn't have to make sense to brainwashed cultists. They will rationalize this in their own minds. It's how cults work.,Rich_Housing971,2025-04-30T08:44:30,6

"A free press is free to lie. Other media are also free to investigate the lying press, and citizens are free to discuss which ones are lying and which ones to trust.  This only works when the population can think rationally and is well enough educated and know enough about how the world works to know which one is more trustworthy.  So in reality, no, the system doesn't really work.",Rich_Housing971,2025-04-30T08:46:31,1
