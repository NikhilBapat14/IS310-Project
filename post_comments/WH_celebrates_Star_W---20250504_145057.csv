"Part of me is shaking my head over this, another part of me wants to give props to whoever is running that account. When it comes to Star Wars, I always imagined Trump’s understanding of the subject to be equal to Lucille Bluth, “Here’s $20, go see a Star War.”",According_To_Me,2025-05-04T15:37:35,74

I'm sure people will get upset over this as well.,Panzershrekt,2025-05-04T15:11:23,0
This is the type of Trump mischief I appreciate. Not the kind where he jokes about running for a third term 😂😭,jakedonn,2025-05-04T16:58:24,0
The Trump administration certainly knows how to troll. It's hilarious! 🤣,GeoChallenge,2025-05-04T15:20:27,-2

"It's absolutely hilarious how ""offended"" the brigade is over a few joke images. It's some of the weakest attempts at manipulating a narrative that I've seen.",Hrendo,2025-05-04T18:45:57,-5
"The outrage over that ai picture was unreal over there. They were so bent out of shape, they actually referred to Joe as a “good and faithful Catholic.”",ElectricTurtlez,2025-05-04T17:34:17,11
>Cue all the outraged fellow Catholics  None of those from that thread were Catholic. It was funny. No Catholics are offended by that. We aren't slims.,MichaelSquare,2025-05-04T17:50:35,-5
