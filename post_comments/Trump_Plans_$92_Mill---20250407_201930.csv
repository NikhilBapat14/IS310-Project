To telling Gold Star families “what was in it for their sons and daughters”…. To disrespecting the late Senator John McCain, who served proudly and suffered as a POW….. to desecrating the graves of our soldiers buried at Arlington National Cemetery by standing on their graves, giggling and giving a “thumbs up” for a photo op.
