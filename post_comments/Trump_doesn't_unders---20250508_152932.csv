"**From Symone D. Sanders-Townsend, co-host of ""The Weeknight"":**  The president is sworn to uphold the Constitution, not undermine it. He can't even change it if he wants, as the president has no specific constitutional role in the process for amending the Constitution.  Article V outlines two methods, both of which have a high bar. Under the first, a proposal passed by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate is then ratified by two-thirds of state legislatures. In the second, two-thirds of state legislatures can call for a new constitutional convention — something that has never happened in our history. In neither case is the president even consulted.  This is why our government has endured for more than two centuries. The founders designed it to be impervious to the whims of one man, but flexible enough to adapt with the times.   I’m concerned that some Americans think Trump’s word alone can rewrite our supreme governing document. That is not the case, nor should it be — no matter what Trump and his allies tell you.

The only other thing I’m sure he knows about those words is that he likes tariffs and he doesn’t like constitutions. That’s about it.

Pretty sure Chat-GPT has had him beat for a while, and that’s just a program that runs on a very thin wafer of rocks that we taught how to do math for us.

He can say that he didn’t read it and that comes off genuine because it’s the truth, but not the whole truth. The omission was they pitched it to him so he does agree with the pitch.
