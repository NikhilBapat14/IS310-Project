"But guys everyone told me Republicans were terrified of Trump, they’re just going along with him out of fear for their lives and of losing their seats!",Competitive_Bug5416,2025-04-30T12:14:50,110
">House Republicans are trying to massively expand Donald Trump’s executive powers with a bill that is ostensibly about taxes and border security.  >The House Judiciary Committee released a draft bill Monday that would move antitrust enforcement away from the independent Federal Trade Commission into the Justice Department. The bill would also require congressional approval for all new regulations, giving Republicans greater power over virtually the entire federal government.  >Under the bill, federal agencies would have to submit portions of their rules to Congress, which would have to approve them within five years. If the rules aren’t approved, they would be gone, giving Republicans the ability to easily gut regulations they don’t like.",thenewrepublic,2025-04-30T12:03:58,71

"Apparently the Democrats have no counter attack.  There are no ad campaigns pushing the narrative of truth: human children…of whom some are  citizens, have been disappeared. This shit should be popping up when people watch memes on social media. You have to go to left leaning media to read about it or Reddit.  The video of the Venezuelans being pulled off the plane and processed into CECOT. Trump shows it at a rally, resulting in cheers. It’s an abomination. Where is the counter-campaign where we get a familiar voice to narrate the atrocities and the heartlessness of Trump supporters?",industrial-complex,2025-04-30T13:06:32,32
They *want* this   They arent unwilling participants at this point. They signed up for this. They all think they are the exception and won't be betrayed and cheated on by the guy who betrays and cheats on all of them.  All the sane ones were run out of the party years ago or are retiring and too cowardly to say anything until they secure their gravy train.,themattboard,2025-04-30T12:23:39,21
"Because they are just as wicked as he is.   They are not decent people being coerced into bad things.  They are indecent people empowering other indecent people, counting on optimistic, decent, and forgiving people like you to carry water for them, using 'fear' as a convenient excuse, while protecting and celebrating acts of terrorism against the general federal workforce and political boogeymen of their own propaganda.   Even John McCain, supposedly decent person,  unleashed Sarah Palin on the country (directly leading to Trump).   When a woman at one of his rallies called Obama a ""Muslim"" as a slur, John McCain met her halfway ""He's not a Muslim;  He's a decent man.""  He didn't correct the record by clarifying Obama's religion by citing well known public events (the Reverend Wright 'scandal.')  He didn't admonish her bigotry against Muslims.   He tried to ""defend"" Obama by contrasting being Muslim (false allegation) with another (decent man).     There is a faustian rot at the core of being a Republican which makes everyone hold their tongue for the sake of not suffering a political setback.  Nor do they attempt to correct the behavior of the lowest common denominator.   They'd rather lean into self-destructive behavior if it can benefit them in the short term, pledging to, at some indeterminate point in the future, adjust course when they deem it a step too far, not able to follow any inductive reasoning or recursive train of thought to see the truth that they're already setting themselves up for failure.   It is not fear, it is a fundamental lack of core principles and religious devotion to the conservative cause .   There is no moral truth too sacred to debase",GaimeGuy,2025-04-30T12:58:29,11
"This is where the Dems miss their chance to make a very public show of the new executive authority by even just mentioning that one day a Democratic president will have these same powers too. Republicans never think that far ahead, and apparently neither do Dems.",mkt853,2025-04-30T12:28:17,9

"Every democrat decision is made by looking at trends and statistics. Which is working perfectly in the Republicans favor.  Meanwhile, Trump just creates a false narrative and gets elected. I don’t think the Democrats have to lie or cheat to win. They just have to stop fighting for power within. Look at the fucking lies MAGA senators and representatives will parrot to stay aligned with the party narrative. They goose step together.  Id bet a whole nickel if the Democrats had a siesta at the Watergate for a long weekend, with the goal of creating a cohesive narrative on what’s wrong and how to fix it, we would see progress in the next hundred days.",industrial-complex,2025-04-30T13:44:11,7
