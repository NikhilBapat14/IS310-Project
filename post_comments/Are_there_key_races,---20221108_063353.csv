"I would recommend taking a look at [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com) tonight to best answer this question. They have a liveblog going on, and unlike most media coverage of the night, 538 does a good job avoiding partisan hot takes and other really stupid takes. They've already talked a bit about some this question.  But overall, the concept of certain races being ""turning points"" in the night is a bit overblown. The bottom line is that one race going well doesn't mean another will or won't. Just look at 2020, where the Dems had some weird underperformances in the Senate races in Maine and North Carolina, some right on like in Arizona, and some odd overperformances like in Georgia.  Looking at close races is actually not even a very good way to answer this question. For example, in PA and GA we've got races that could go either way. This means that just a very slight underperformance for either side could result in a widely different outcome, and such minor variations may not actually signal much. But also, because we're at 50/50 in the Senate, you could see the night mostly go according to plan for both sides and still see a major shift in the status quo.  In a lot of ways, the best way to answer this question is to look at the margin and measure the under or overperformance there. For example, on the 538 chat they've noticed that there is a 7 point gap between Warnock and Abrams, despite both sharing the same ballots, which is entirely consistent with the polling. Similarly, they're closely watching the abortion ballot measure in KY.  But if you're just looking for a very simple ""what is the best indicator of who will control the Senate or House?"" then you should try and see which races have the closest margins and see if they go the way they are ""supposed"" to. Looking up the 538 election forecast would give you enough to determine that on your own, and obviously if the two closest Senate races (PA and GA) are determined early...then that's probably a pretty good indicator.  https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/senate/",mormagils,2022-11-08T18:58:01,10
