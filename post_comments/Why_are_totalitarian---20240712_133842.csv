"People, inherently, do not want to live in a totalitarian country with hard right or corrupt leaders. The existence of elections reinforces, no matter how the vote is tallied, that the people duly elected the leader that many may privately despise and even though there may only be one name on the ballot they cast; to the state it adds the needed legitimacy.",rastel,2024-07-14T17:50:05,2
