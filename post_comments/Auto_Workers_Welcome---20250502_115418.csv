">The dislocation at car companies has only gotten worse in recent weeks as Trump’s tariffs have prompted temporary layoffs and a pullback in stock buybacks and capital spending.  >But as Benson sees it, Trump’s tariffs are the US’s best chance to reverse the damaging effects of the long-running factory drain and restore American manufacturing might. After a lifetime of voting for Democrats, including twice for Barack Obama, he has morphed into a vocal Trump backer, exhorting his fellow members of the United Auto Workers union to get behind the president.  >“I was a devout Democrat my whole life and got nothing out of it,” Benson said in an interview. “Nobody has done anything to stop the decline until now.”  lol, this dude deserves to lose his job and we will laugh when he does.

"*From Bloomberg News reporter David Welch:*  Some auto workers like James Benson Jr. are all-in on President Donald Trump’s trade war — and they don’t mind if it causes some short-term pain for both Wall Street and Main Street.  Benson has assembled cars and trucks for [Ford Motor Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/F:US) for 26 years. In that time, he has worked at eight different plants. Three closed, he said, and others saw cutbacks as the maker of F-150 pickups, America’s most popular vehicle, lost market share to imports.  The dislocation at car companies has only gotten worse in recent weeks as Trump’s tariffs have prompted temporary layoffs and a pullback in stock buybacks and capital spending.",bloomberg,2025-05-02T11:54:58,2

"Whenever I see a UAW worker carrying water for Trump, I want to ask why isn't Elon musk's Tesla unionized?   Here's an American auto company, who got busted for illegally discouraging union talk, yet Donald Trump handed him enormous power to fire people, many of them federal workers in a union.

"The thing is, they’re right. The rug was pulled out from under them. The part they’re wrong on is who did it and the solutions being implemented to fix it.  The working class was destroyed by corporations and billionaires who wanted more of the pie. It’s a bipartisan problem.  It’s not sustainable to fix this with the current methods. It will take years to get us back to what we once had. At the same time while we claw back the manufacturing many will be laid off, prices will balloon. All resulting in a stagnant working class. Sure in maybe 20-30 years we’ll be back on track but that’s a whole generation left in the lurch. You know who is not impacted by any of this? Right, the wealthy.  These policies are not designed to help the working class, they’re designed to help the wealthy. You think these new factories will pay a living wage and have safe working conditions? No chance.",hmr0987,2025-05-02T12:26:22,3

"Exactly. Tim Cook has said this exactly. Apple will bring manufacturing here when it’s automated.  The aspect of automation that needs to be understood by everyone is if a process is fully automated said company will do it in America. This is because the engineering is here, so having the automation here just makes sense. If a process is not automated it’s likely not economically prosperous to bring it to America. These companies know it’s cheaper to just open up a new shop in a lesser tariffed nation.  All of this is why we have manufacturing where the function requires skilled labor (example: automotive assembly). Even there our workforce is no match to other nations (Korea, Japan, Germany, ets.).  It’s an extremely nuanced issue that we are trying to fix with a hammer. It’s not going make anything better it’s just going to make things different.",hmr0987,2025-05-02T12:51:16,2
