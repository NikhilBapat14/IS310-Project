"Virtually every piece of legislation requires 60 votes to get through the Senate (with a few exceptions for reconciliation bills, which wouldn't apply here). Yes, Congress *can* pass a bill requiring all rail workers get paid sick leave. However, it would require 10 Republican votes in the Senate to pass. In fact, they did try to do this. Concurrent with the bill breaking the expected strike was a bill guaranteeing paid sick leave, but it failed in the Senate.",[deleted],2022-12-05T08:07:20,7
"Having a majority means nothing when any bill can be immediately killed in the Senate unless it can get 60 votes. In this case, having 50 votes is effectively the same as having 0.   So yeah, I mean, it's certainly possible for to pass a law that favors labor in this case. But considering there are already 50ish votes lined up *against* labor, it's just not going to happen. If the Dems could peel away 10 votes to beat the filibuster, they would have done that and this would have ended up WAY differently. But, because the Reps are where they are, and because public sentiment largely backs up the Rep perspective on this, the Dems compromised and passed a bill they really didn't like very much.",mormagils,2022-12-05T09:27:08,2
"There is no union or corporate side. They both came up with this agreement, but the membership decided after the negotiations that they didn't like it. Congress basically can say a strike is illegal and they have to go to work no matter what. Or a strike is illegal and you have to adhere to the agreement you already came up with. Congress coming up with their own CBA wouldn't go well. They wouldn't get it passed and I'm not sure it would hold up in court.",HTC864,2022-12-05T07:29:22,1
"They do have sick leave.  1)  rail employees who are unable to work due to sickness, after a waiting period, receive up to 26 weeks of partial income replacement — under a federal law known as the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA).   2) In addition to RUIA benefits, some rail employees receive, at the   railroads’ expense, a supplemental sickness benefit that increases the income replacement rate above the RUIA rate (to approximately 70% of daily pay) and extends the period of payment to a maximum of 52weeks  3) . In prior bargaining rounds, several rail labor organizations actually “traded” paid sick days provided for in their collective bargaining agreements for supplemental sickness benefits.  4) Rail employees can “mark off” — or temporarily remove themselves from the list of available employees — at any time and for any reason, including sickness or personal reasons, as long as they maintain a reasonable level of overall availability under carrier attendance policies",StedeBonnet1,2022-12-12T06:51:10,0
"Just FYI, they DID attempt to pass an amendment with the sick days. It failed 52-43.   https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3758436-senate-rejects-proposal-to-give-rail-workers-seven-days-of-paid-sick-leave/  So they passed the basic package, then attempted to pass this addendum for sick days, which failed.",ProLifePanda,2022-12-05T09:42:05,6
"This is not the case.  Congress cannot declare a strike *illegal*. To do so would violate both the 1st and 13th Amendments. When you make something illegal, you're imposing criminal sanctions on it.  What Congress did was declare a strike *unlawful*. What this means is that while the rail workers are free to refuse to work (and to collectively make a decision about that), they will not receive the protections afforded by labor law if they do so. The main protections are that, in a lawful strike, your employer cannot fire you or (in some cases) permanently replace you.",ViskerRatio,2022-12-05T10:35:12,3
"So it is the case, but the wrong word was used? But thank you for the correction. Every source I've read said illegal, so it took a min to find another take just now.",HTC864,2022-12-05T10:41:29,1
"It's the kind of distinction journalists miss but the Department of Labor pays close attention to.  In practice, declaring an strike unlawful makes it unlikely to ever occur. An unlawful strike is the equivalent of walking into your boss's office, declaring ""I quit!"" and then adding a list of ways your boss can convince you to come back to work. In most cases, your boss would simply hire someone else to replace you.",ViskerRatio,2022-12-05T10:48:06,3
"Whereas in the case of a lawful strike, your boss will hire someone to replace you but has to let you back into your old job or one similar to it when a position is open.   For some fields with low turnover this might take a while.",[deleted],2022-12-08T04:11:54,1
