"**TL;DR**: Democrats sharply criticized Trump’s first 100 days, calling them a ""failure"" on the economy, democracy, and middle-class families, with Senate leader Schumer accusing Republicans of being ""complicit."" They pointed to economic contraction, rising costs, and controversial policies as proof. Despite their own low approval ratings, Democrats aim to regain voter trust by focusing on affordability and accountability, hoping to flip Congress in 2026 and counter Trump’s agenda.",pharrt,2025-04-30T16:14:27,2
