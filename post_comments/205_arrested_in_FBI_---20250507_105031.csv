">They get them sometimes to post explicit pictures of themselves after they talk to them and then in some cases, they even try to blackmail the children.  Happened to my nephew when he was like 16-17.   He was (is) a stupid kid and thought he was talking to some girl and sent explicit pictures of himself and got blackmailed. He asked his mom for help and luckily she saw right through what was happening.   This is one that hits a little close to home and I hope those creeps go to prison for a very long time.",Quirky-Marsupial-420,2025-05-07T19:55:35,23
"Given that some of those arrested were police officers, it just goes to show that anyone can be a pedophile. And what's scary about that is the fact they can be the people you'd least expect.",DeathTheSoulReaper,2025-05-07T21:42:04,11
"Weird, I can’t find this story in all the popular subreddits 🤔",JTuck333,2025-05-07T16:43:46,12
"Yes! Love it. As a victim myself, when I see that police officers are involved I want to gag! Pedophiles can be anyone, possibly the whiners in this sub that can't enjoy a victory like this while crying about what hasn't been done.",Roudyrepublican,2025-05-07T16:48:40,12
"I guess another thing that bothers me is I am NO fan of the MSM but at the end of the conference neither Bondi or Patel took any questions. Just arrogantly walked away even though the press was heard saying they had questions. What's the matter was Bondi and Patel both afraid the MSM just might ask the questions we have been asking with no response, like Epstein, corruption fraud and theft of our tax money? These are the things we the public have been looking for.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-07T11:23:31,80

Awesome! Let’s get to Epstein’s clients now.,ronomaly,2025-05-07T20:40:17,7

"When “both” of these individuals were going through their confirmations,myself along with many others all over the country voiced our opinions in support to our respected congressmen by email and or phone..  While I didn’t do this for bondi,simply because I didn’t know much about her,I did do this for Patel….and for a reason…  I and or we were “assured” that on their implementation into the machine that heads would roll…grandiose proclamations from both of these people of rooting out corruption from within the DOJ and government itself were made….  While I understand that things take time and roadblocks can be expected,a bit of insight from their end would go a very long way to those that gave them support..  The FBI,while I believe is corrupt,has always,to an extent did their job “somewhat”……albeit quite a bit of bias was involved….these arrests of weirdo pedos in such large numbers is admirable but to this situation…..is nothing new or groundbreaking…they’ve always arrested pedos….  While I support their efforts and do give benefit of doubt to both of them,I must remind “both” of them that these things are not what they gained support from the people for…  It looks bad when we’re told the Epstein files would be released on day one….looks even worse that what files were released were nothing more than previously released files that in some cases were redacted all the while the previously released versions were not…  All I’m saying is…..let’s see some actual investigations into the corruption as promised..",tsoxiko,2025-05-09T06:24:31,1
"These two are actually making the country safer. I have never in my life, I’m almost 50, seen more positive things accomplished in this country than I have since Jan 20.

You would hope so. So some people will find a way to criticize this.,Coool_cool_cool_cool,2025-05-07T13:42:22,79

Put in applications for all those unmoderated subs.,ChristopherRoberto,2025-05-07T13:33:27,21
"You whine like this in every thread about Bondi and it's embarrassing. There was one lefty reporter trying to ask questions, and she wasn't going to ask about Epstein. If you care so much about child abuse then guess what? This is great news. Bondi also gave a brief update on the Epstein stuff yesterday too, but you're too busy complaining to know that.",Hrendo,2025-05-07T12:30:55,21
"And who says I'm not? But the point is those were KIDS also in the Epstein ordeal, where are you on them? Now after all this time she states there is just to much evidence so it has been passed on to Patel and the FBI to sort out. So she couldn't figure that out weeks ago? Just dragging her feet, and giving news conferences to which she actually had no part in. So again tell me how this is no concern on my part for kids..",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-07T15:42:33,45
And you do nothing but cater to the do nothing's in government.,Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-07T13:46:40,47
"Also Bondi simply makes news conference appearances, if you were paying attention yesterday she was actually thanking the organisations who actually did the work, as for my whining as you say it has involved more than just Epstein, it also included the corruption, theft and fraud of our tax dollars, maybe your ok with that. But some of us would like to see some accountability, obviously you prefer things as they are.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-07T13:54:51,17
>And who says I'm not?   I'm saying it. Because you've had two posts now to give credit is where credit is due and haven't done so.,MichaelSquare,2025-05-07T16:00:08,-18
"I give credit for those who did the job, which is not Bondi. Bondi was not hired to just be the spokesperson go for the DOJ, she was hired to prosecute crime, but so far all we see her doing is TV interviews and news conferences praising offices who are actually doing the job they were hired to do.if Bondi just wants to be a tv personality the I suggest Trump get us a new AG.",Flashy-Increase-2075,2025-05-07T16:07:39,24
"Some people are just not impressed. This guy's last comment to you said we only see Bondi on the TV lol would he rather the cameras follow her around whilst she does her paperwork? Of course she has to give on air interviews and we're not going to see the work she does behind the scenes. I agree with you MichaelSquare, people should be happy about what's been getting done, but they just want to complain.",Roudyrepublican,2025-05-07T16:43:52,4
