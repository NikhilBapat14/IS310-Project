"I just love this photo you posted of him. ‚ò∫Ô∏è it does not say ‚Äò I am proud of what I did‚Äô.  It says ‚Äò There is hope, and I am eager to see, who of my peers will take the next step to save our future‚Äô. For myself, I think whoever does something so powerful next, needs to start doing it by this weekend. You know that saying: while the iron is hot. If you are reading the postings Mr Booker, Thank You",Alternative_Gate4158,2025-04-03T10:31:33,1

Booker & AOC/Crockett would be *powerful*.,ZoomZoom_Driver,2025-04-02T00:00:17,25

AOC. I would personally campaign for them.,Yamipervert,2025-04-02T00:01:01,25
"Me too. :) i think AOC on the ticket would bring more people than Crockett, as awesome as both women are. :)",ZoomZoom_Driver,2025-04-02T00:01:49,12
"Crockett is incredible and has fire, but AOC is a force of nature.",Yamipervert,2025-04-02T00:03:40,8
"I love Crockett, but I doubt this country is ready for 2 black people on the ticket. They‚Äôd be ok with AOC, but you know the propaganda against her is going to be so strong.",Loveroffinerthings,2025-04-02T08:12:28,10
Maybe AG Crockett could have some fun locking up all the racist dorks?,primum,2025-04-02T12:41:26,3
