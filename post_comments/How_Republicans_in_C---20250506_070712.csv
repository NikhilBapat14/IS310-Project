All GOP legislators are complicit in these crimes. Abandoning their oaths and prioritizing self interest over the interests of the American people make them equally as guilty as those in the regime. They have chosen the side of fascism and we won’t forget it.,m1j2p3,2025-05-06T07:20:31,121
The GOP is not getting enough heat out on them for this. They are enablers to the fall of American Democracy.,FVjake,2025-05-06T07:40:30,42
"GOP Legislators are the true villain here and we need not forget it in upcoming election(s).  They have turned their backs on constituents and as the season of calamity begins to unfold in the country: tornadoes, hurricanes, strong storms in south, west and NE are upon us, there will be no assistance from this administration. Like Ted Cruz in trump 1.0, they will find themselves vacationing someplace else.   They have gutted govt and surprisingly, I have not seen a reduction in my taxes. Neither will you.  We do see a quiet redirect with Musk gaining new contracts and having paused contracts continued.",Thin-Competition3018,2025-05-06T07:32:15,22

"Unfortunately there are no real consequences for their actions. There has been so much gerrymandering and voter suppression that incumbents lose based on individual characteristics rather than party affiliation. There have been instances of dead incumbents winning elections. Examples of those that don’t deserve reelection abound yet their constituents have re-elected them repeatedly. Of course my favorites are MTG and Lauren Boebert. Term limits are the only solution to creating change, but the chances of that happening are as slim as creating change in the midterms.",johnn48,2025-05-06T13:03:04,2

"They are afraid they’ll get primaried. But, unaware that the current policies (tariffs, vandalizing agencies, deporting with no trial) are phenomenally unpopular — and may flip the Congress next election.

"This congress has been especially ready to hand their power to the executive, but [Unitary Executive Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory) has been pursued by conservative organizations like Heritage since Reagan.  I worry that if we associate these agendas to Trump or to a specific congress, we miss the long-term threats that will exist long after Trump.  There will always be individuals who see egalitarian principles as an challenge to their dominance of power hierarchies, rather than a stabilizing force.",SurrealEstate,2025-05-06T10:31:22,1

"Let’s stop feeding the narcissistic machine. Every time we use the T-word, we boost the brand of someone who wants us to obsess over him good or bad. Instead, let’s starve the algorithm.

Call him  DRUMPF, the Not-So-Great Pumpkin, Donnie Two-Scoops, Agent Orange, the Fauxphet, Cheeto Caesar, the Bronze Calf, Baron of Bankruptcy, or just The Former Guy.
