"Well duh.   We still have lots of people here on Reddit politics don't believe fascism is here. They still think we're going to have normal elections in 2026. That's why they're still satisfied to use words and waving a few cute placards around at a protest.   Get a clue: fascists don't allow normal elections.   If procedural and government interference doesn't stop Democrats from getting elected, then they'll simply use violence and intimidation.    Until everybody accepts the fact that fascism is already here they're not going to accept the need for a genuine plan of action and they will continue to be satisfied with just talk.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-08T17:36:03,46
