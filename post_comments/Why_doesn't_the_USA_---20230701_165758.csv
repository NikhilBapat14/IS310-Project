"They‚Äôre both quite different scenarios.   At large, they‚Äôre both tricky because they have their own internal dynamics on whether or not they should or want to be states and their perception in the US.   On perception, there‚Äôs often a perception that both would be Democratic safe states if granted statehood - granting additional electoral college votes and Congressional representation to Democrats. While DC likely would be based on current voting trends there - Puerto Rico is less clear. They use technically a different system of parties but in fact, the majority of statewide posts are with those who affiliate more with the Republican alliance than the Democrats. Either way, I think pro-statehood people would argue this shouldn‚Äôt be a political game - if they‚Äôre citizens have to be states, they deserve to be represented equally (and many would make the argument that they are more deserving of, for example, their respective senators than smaller current states ((that are predominantly Republican)).   There‚Äôs a long-standing understanding that DC was intentionally created as it is to explicitly not be a state. This was, of course, before it was a thriving metropolis with a large number of long-term residents itself. That‚Äôs why, even in proposals to grant DC statehood, there is still a carve out (of various sizes) on what counts as the federal district still. Some have also proposed that it be subsumed outside of these carve outs into existing states (notably, part of the original territory made for DC has already be reabsorbed into Virginia). All to say, there‚Äôs no clear path forward on which way DC is granted statehood if it‚Äôs granted statehood at all. But notably, DC residents have expressed pretty strong support towards statehood.   Puerto Rico is less clear. There have been several referenda - each with their own flaws. There‚Äôs a general perception in the US, especially given the dynamic above about ‚Äòupsetting the balance‚Äô that unless Puerto Rico chooses statehood - it‚Äôs not for the US to force it. Again, this has gone to vote in different ways in Puerto Rico and almost all of them have had some issues - confusing questions, multi-step questions that don‚Äôt grant a strong majority or even plurality, boycotts on the vote, etc etc etc etc.",PhiloPhocion,2023-07-02T13:58:01,9
"I‚Äôm simply going to add that the PPD (pro-territory) and the PNP (pro statehood) parties have about equal support in Puerto Rico. The third major party, the PIP, supports independence. It‚Äôs not a cut-and-dry process to give PR statehood. There is a good chunk of Puerto Ricans who don‚Äôt want statehood.",SGP_MikeF,2023-07-03T20:36:22,2
"This is a very simple question to answer. These states would add democratic votes to congress. Therefore the person with the tipping point vote to add them would be losing his position as the tipping point, eroding his own power. No one would ever make that decision.",podcastcritic,2023-07-03T02:19:39,1
Congress and senate have been carefully balanced for generations. The only reason Hawaii and Alaska got in was doing them at the same time so as not to disturb the balance. So you‚Äôll have to wait until either balancing states that can also be added or enough imbalance that one party can do it unilaterally.,ElectronGuru,2023-07-02T13:29:04,1
"Short answer. It would create two Democratic states.  The long answer. PR would have to want to become a state, and currently, it could be argued that we don't really know for sure it would want to be one. They have the same voter turn out as the US, so whenever it comes up for a vote and statehood wins, its still with a fraction of the population.  DC is another matter, and the argument has come up that DC was meant to be a neutral meeting ground. It's an absurd argument since the State of Columbia would have no way of influencing government anyways, and modern purposals would maintain a Federal district the White House and Congrese would remain inside outside of state control.  It boils down to Republicans don't want them to be states.",Shakezula84,2023-07-03T11:18:25,1
"Two things re PR:  1. The new states would add senators and reps, which would disadvantage one party. (This is part of why why democrats oppose splitting California and republicans oppose PR statehood)  2. It would be expensive. PR is low income - they currently get reduced levels of welfare, but making it a state would significantly increase welfare costs.  DC is an odd bird because the best reading of the constitution is that it *can't* be a state.",ScaryBuilder9886,2023-07-15T11:24:28,1
It is specified in the constitution that DC can not be a state,Evil_B2,2023-08-13T23:17:54,1
PR would at best lean Democratic,loselyconscious,2023-07-04T04:30:27,2
"Balance between what? Blue States and Red States, that's definitely not true, most states had way different partisan leans when they gained statehood",loselyconscious,2023-07-04T04:31:22,1
"For DC, couldn't they still have a ""District of Columbia"" centered around the building the line the national mall and create a new state from the actual city?",Vagabond_Tea,2023-07-15T11:29:45,1
DC can still exist. Many propose an area just around the National Mall (and the surrounding gov buildings) while the rest of the actual city becomes its own state.,Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-13T23:43:26,1

What would the justification be to make a city into a state?,Evil_B2,2023-08-18T16:29:16,1
Because they are US citizens without proper representation,Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-18T17:19:06,1
So carve out the area around the national mall and make the rest part of Maryland. Problem solved.,Evil_B2,2023-08-18T17:30:16,1
"I'd rather listen and try to respect what the citizens of DC want. Plus, even if they did happen, most citizens would want to be part of Virginia.",Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-18T18:10:06,1
Yeah except that‚Äôs now how it works. You don‚Äôt get to add more congressmen because you don‚Äôt like the balance of power.,Evil_B2,2023-08-18T18:14:06,1
"I never mentioned anything about that. I was more concerned about taxation without representation, but ok. I guess you've shown your agenda lol.",Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-18T19:07:24,1
Yes because you are just so concerned about the 600k people that live in DC üòÇ,Evil_B2,2023-08-18T19:12:49,1
"As I used to live in the area, yes, I do. Btw, that's still more people than some states. And I personally know people in DC.",Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-19T12:22:46,1
"And you don‚Äôt think that they could be fairly represented as a part of Maryland or Virginia? You do realize that as a creation of the constitution DC could not become a state without a constitutional amendment, right?",Evil_B2,2023-08-19T14:25:36,1
Wrong. DC would still exist. You don't need to make amendment to create a new state.   And I believe we should listen to what the citizens of DC want. Same goes for the people of Puerto Rico.  But your political views are quite apparent.,Vagabond_Tea,2023-08-19T14:35:02,1
"DC would not still exist. Article I of the Constitution states that the District cannot exceed ‚Äúten Miles square‚Äù. This language means ‚Äúa square with a side of 10 miles‚Äù, or 100 square miles‚Äînot 10 square miles.  100 square miles is exactly what was donated by Maryland and Virginia as part of the Residence Act of 1790.   A portion of this District to the west of the Potomac River was returned in Virginia in 1846 resulting in the shape of the District we know today. All together, D.C. comprises 68.34 miles‚Äîwell below the 100 square mile limit set by the constitution.   It would take a constitutional amendment to change that.",Evil_B2,2023-08-19T15:01:59,1
