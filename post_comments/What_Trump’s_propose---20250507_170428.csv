"""Experts are warning that President Donald Trump’s proposal to slash roughly 43 percent of funding for federal housing programs, like Section 8 vouchers, could have devastating effects for millions of Americans, as the country already faces a housing supply and affordability crisis.  The White House’s “skinny budget” proposal, released Friday, calls for $26.7 billion in cuts to Section 8 and other housing assistance programs. A new grant, called the State Rental Assistance Block Grant, would reallocate the remaining funds for these programs to states to develop their own initiatives.  “The Budget empowers States by transforming the current Federal dysfunctional rental assistance programs into a State-based formula grant which would allow States to design their own rental assistance programs based on their unique needs and preferences,” the proposal reads.""""  https://archive.is/ujoCn",Agreeable-Rooster-37,2025-05-07T17:05:41,3

I’m a conservative but I don’t understand why he’s proposing this when most Americans are struggling as it is. Here’s an idea Trump revoke it from the people abusing it and give it to the people who really are in need,Unlucky-Decision-215,2025-05-10T14:35:56,1
