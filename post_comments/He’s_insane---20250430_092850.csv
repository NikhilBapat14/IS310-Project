"""Allow"" is a strong word here. The Supreme Court didn't ""allow"" him to send people to CECOT without due process, and what did he do? Told them to fuck off.¬†   Trump has already done NUMEROUS things that usurped congressional power. Had EOs shut down by the courts. The problem is when he has an AG and a cabinet that will do his bidding anyways, it doesn't matter what the courts and congress say. Yeah, EOs aren't law - that doesn't matter when he has sycophants who voluntarily comply.¬†   The FEC is inoperative. A Trump appointee was told to step down, and he did. He will not be replaced.¬†   There is no reason to believe there will be another election. There may be the illusion of one, but it'll be Putinesque.

Agreed. I voted early and I voted for Kamala. I‚Äôm certain there was a lot of monkey business in this election. check out how many legal voters were purged it‚Äôs easy to see how Trump won. I don‚Äôt think NC Supreme Court seat has been called. The Democrat won the seat but the repugs are trying to remove voters in that election I also think there will be another Jan 6. Trump won‚Äôt leave on his own. Him and his whole administration should be prosecuted so no Garland this time. They‚Äôll need a hero at DOJ. So many have left their jobs because they wouldn‚Äôt commit crimes. Yes I know it will take years to figure out how many crimes have been commuted but I say assign Jack Smith to SC and let him finish what he started.,TamIAm12,2025-05-01T16:30:14,1
