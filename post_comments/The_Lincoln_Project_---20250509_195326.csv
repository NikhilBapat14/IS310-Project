"Or to put it another way the ""rules for thee but not for me"" defense.  Sad but more or less on par from what we have come to expect from the trump administration.",Mikethebest78,2025-05-09T20:11:44,16

"Huh? J6's are most certainly not running the country. J6's are the brainwashed cult peons. The low level, ""poorly educated,"" qanon deplorables who cover their pickups in flags, watch Breitbart as their Sunday sermon,   camp at Trump rallies in ridiculous costumes awaiting instructions from their master. No one who ran at the Capitol has a position in Trump's government.",undercurrents,2025-05-09T20:58:51,0

Who do you think all the contracted ICE agents are? They may not be running the country but they are running it into the ground.,Hippy_Lynne,2025-05-10T01:58:34,3
"That's not what the person I'm replying to said, and you even acknowledge that. Most certainly law enforcement is filled with J6's. That's not the same as ""running the country."" I'm literally replying to *that* line. Had they said ""running it into the ground,"" I would have agreed. You can't tell me I'm wrong while also saying the line I'm replying to is wrong (""they may *not* be running the country..."") Because yes, they are not running the country.",undercurrents,2025-05-10T10:18:35,0
