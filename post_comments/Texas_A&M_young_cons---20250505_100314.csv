"I graduated Texas A&M and this doesn’t surprise me at all. I went to high-school in Dallas and I don’t think I ever heard people being outwardly racist at school - their parents, yes, but not my friends and classmates. Then I went to A&M and was shocked how racist so many of the students to were and how it was always wrapped in an off-color joke and generally accepted by most people around me.   I had a few friends who didn’t come out until after they graduated. I had one black friend who would act “the part” just so people would like him vs potentially come after him.   I met my wife there, I had some good times, but I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. I don’t claim it like so many Aggie’s do, and it’s this type of shit that keeps me from doing so.   Also, it’s a major recruiting place for FBI and CIA agents so keep that in mind.",SenorKerry,2025-05-05T21:00:12,2

There's value in documenting it. The right lives off of plausible deniability for their dog whistles. Stories like these hurt the rights ability to have any plausible deniability. ,SnowyyRaven,2025-05-05T10:55:59,16
