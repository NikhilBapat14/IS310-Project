We failed as a country a long time ago to stamp out the rot, and this cancer that has been festering and slowly eating us away has finally come to fruition and in control of everything this country has.

"Speaking out isn't enough; this is also beyond any progressive/anti-authoritarian officials to solve. The responsbility to end this profane mockery of governance within our republic falls squarely on us - you, whoever all might be reading this, and I... and everybody else. To put this bluntly: We are *already* in a full-blown authoritarian regime: American Citizens are being pulled off the street, being arrested and sent off to god knows where just because they *may* be of a certain race or background.  # Let me say that again: Under the orders of Donald Trump, the current President of our country, American Citizens are being arrested, deported to foreign countries, and imprisoned simply because they might be hispanic.  Authoritarianism is ***already here*****.** The machine of government that we have, unfortunately, come to rely on to keep us safe has become a weapon that is actively being used against us. Right now, that machine wants you to be isolated, in a state of hopeless panic and despair -- because that's when you will be most apathetic to the cruelty that they intend to wield against you. But we cannot despair, and we cannot afford any longer to be apathetic. The time to see how bad things can get has long since passed; we can see, very clearly, where the road this adminstration is leading us on will go.  Your government is working destroy you; to crush you under it's immeasurable weight. Are you going to let it? When will enough be enough? Will it be enough when they take your social security? What about when you get contacted by Homeland Security for speaking out against the administration, or when ICE raids the school your children go to arrest and deport them to some far-off land? Even if it's not today, it's going to happen - sooner or later, the administration will come for *you.* And they are counting on you doing *nothing* to stop them. That is why it is *your civic duty* to stop them; if not for your own sake, then for the sake of your children, or your siblings, or your parents, or your friends, or your neighbors.   We must protest. We must strike, and we must riot. If the administration will wield the bludgeon of government against us then, to survive, we must become ungovernable. We must be willing to do uncomfortable, uncivilized things - and we must do them. There is no cavalry coming to save you or I and no higher-authority to which we can appeal to; if you are to survive, it must be because you fought to do so.

"As I said in another thread, the comparable situations to what we have now or Italy in 1922 and Germany in 1933. In both cases there was a brief period of time before the fascist leaders were able to completely weaponize the government against opposition but no one could think of or organize any effective action against.    So nothing was effective.   So that's a distinct possibility here as well. I've studied a lot of history and I can't think of any case where a fascist regime actually took over as they have here and it was stopped by words and protests.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-01T11:42:16,4
"Addition:  It‘s an extremely important fact, that every governMENT is VASTLY outnumbered by the goverNED.  I‘m German, let me tell you from the darkest parts our history, that Dictatorship is extremely fragile and absolutely depends on the illusion of control.  The first step is to give dissenters a feeling of isolation and impotence - neither is real!  All forms of government rely on consent. Evil thrives, when good people don’t speak up.  You still can change the direction in which your country is heading. Stand for you Values!  You are NOT alone, you are MANY - but you must make yourselves HEARD and SEEN.  Now is the right time for a peaceful course correction - the governmental structure has been severely weakened by the brutal evisceration by DOGE and the new systems are not yet fully implemented.  It’s like fresh cement, sticky and difficult to move, but give it time to settle an it gets harder and harder to achieve change.",archiopteryx14,2025-05-01T00:57:51,19
