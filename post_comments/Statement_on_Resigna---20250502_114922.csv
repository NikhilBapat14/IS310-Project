">As the Signalgate scandal continues to roil the Trump administration, nonprofit watchdog American Oversight released the following statement from interim Executive Director Chioma Chukwu responding to reports that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his principal deputy Alex Wong will be departing their White House posts imminently:  >“While the resignations of Mike Waltz and his principal deputy are clearly warranted, their behavior is just a symptom of a much deeper and systemic problem within this administration — a complete disregard for transparency, federal records laws, and the responsibility to protect our national security.  >“It speaks volumes that President Trump views the original sin as the addition of a reporter to the Signal chat, rather than the reckless and illegal use of Signal’s auto-deleting feature for highly sensitive national security discussions — conduct that put the safety of our brave men and women in uniform at risk.  >“Our litigation continues, and we remain committed to holding this administration accountable and ensuring it follows >the law. The American people deserve nothing less.”  If it sounds like they're taking credit, they kind of are. I don't think it was just them, indeed the wider media outrage on the signalgate stuff was of course part of a larger public pressure campaign. But American Oversight is directly challenging the Trump admin with lawsuits, so they're the concentrated pressure point the rest of the public is channeling through, I think.",Sachyriel,2025-05-02T11:51:59,2
