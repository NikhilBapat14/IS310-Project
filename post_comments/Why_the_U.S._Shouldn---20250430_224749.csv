"Maybe time to do a root  cause analysis about the HOW and WAY so many Americans are hooked on fentanyl?  1. Sackler Family falsely promotes super strong opiate (Oxycodone) as less addictive than others.  2. The FDA accepts their ""studies""  3. Sackler Family sells millions of prescriptions thru doctors rubber stamping the patients needs. Whole medical clinics are setup just to sell their fucked up drug.  4. Science finds that they were bullshitting the world about their drug not being very addictive and puts the breaks on it. They shut down most of those fake clinics. Doctors stop prescribing it to most of the users.  5. The existing users can't find it and now woefully addicted turn to other replacement street drugs. The use spreads throughout the country.    6. Sackler family walks away with a fine and never spends a day in jail.  7. Thousands of Americans are hooked on fentanyl.   THE END.",williamgman,2025-05-01T00:34:55,10

"…Because capitalism, enterprise, and freedom remain in states of conflict- see bottled water sold in stores. 30 years ago, that isle of bottle water was full of sugared, caffeinated soda products. How we forget that in 1886 Coca Cola was SO FREAKING GOOD, because John Stith and a couple of partners sold a carbonated drink with ground up Coca leaves and kola nuts for flavoring. Coca Kola was SO FREAKING GOOD that it became apparent that the ownership class couldn’t control it- hence THEY OUTLAWED the product.",BarneyFife516,2025-05-01T07:51:11,1

"The American right believes that drug addicts are worthless and undeserving of help. If they die, who cares? Their answer is always “It was God’s will” or “They were a drain and didn’t deserve to live anyway.”   You have to really hate yourself to believe other people are that expendable.",AlllliillllA,2025-05-01T00:35:37,7
