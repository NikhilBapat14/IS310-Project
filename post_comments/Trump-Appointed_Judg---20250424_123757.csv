"I posted this 2 days ago... It still holds up:  Tomorrow night will pass. Either by them filing more bogus excuses, requesting a stay as they move to the Appellate, or just plain blowing it off.  She will then have to file contempt charge that then needs to be enforced... By the DOJ... The Executive Branch. They will drag their feet.  Then she will have to find a non DOJ agent to enforce it... More days go by. This is SO predictable.",williamgman,2025-04-24T12:45:28,74
"From reporter Sara Boboltz:  The courts have already said Kilmar Abrego Garcia should come home. Now a judge says a 20-year-old man should be returned.      A federal judge ruled Wednesday that a second man must be returned from the El Salvador megaprison where he was hastily deported by President Donald Trump’s administration in March.  The man, referred to in court documents by the pseudonym Cristian, was among those swept up by immigration officials and flown to a brutal facility where inmates are told they will never leave.

"It's honestly unbelievable that we're even discussing the applicability of the Alien Enemies Act, that law from 1798, really, and the fact that it's being used to target members of the Tren de Aragua gang, while also acknowledging a breach of contract concerning this man's asylum claim... it's just... deeply concerning and shows a clear bias.",Tremenda-Carucha,2025-04-24T12:54:46,30
Remember:  Trump and the rich are entitled to delayed court dates and sentencing   The impoverished well we don't have enough judges and then we shouldn't even listen to some judges as well,HandSack135,2025-04-24T12:48:13,22
">“Can you believe the lengths to which this administration will go to ignore court orders and deport vulnerable individuals?”  It really is shocking. The obvious disregard for the courts is just... depressing. I mean, we're talking about people's lives and basic human rights here, and they're just tossing them aside, it's like this is just normal now, unbelievable! It makes you wonder, what *is* the limit to their power grab? And what happens when they finally get pushed back... because they *will* get pushed back eventually. How many people will have suffered until then? Just... infuriating.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-24T13:08:42,18
"This is so disgusting. Trump decides there's an illegal immigrant crisis in USA and to solve this crisis he rounds up anyone that ""looks like an immigrant"" and sends them to a death camp in El Salvador. This is not okay or legal, judges are slow at stopping this one person at a time. This is not how you treat people who exist in the USA, here legally or not.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-24T13:00:58,10
"He appointed this judge.  Let's see what dinkleberry baby cries about this time.  The Felon loses court cases constantly - on our dime - yet still finds it just TOO HARD to govern lawfully, and respect our Constitution.  Rubio's not long for this.  He'll flake the first time he has to choose between Trump-loyalty and catching a Contempt charge.",XSinTrick6666,2025-04-24T13:12:15,6
"It's kind of shitty that the news always has to make a note of who appointed the judge, as if it's a surprise when they actually follow the law instead of delivering quid pro quo corruption.",pervocracy,2025-04-24T14:07:13,9
"Garcia first though.  Imagine if this second immigrant managed to be returned first.  Garcia would be all, what the hell man?",dbag3o1,2025-04-24T13:35:38,4
Yeah…..bring them all back for proper due process. Sending people to permanent prison overseas is just all kinds of wrong.,Limberine,2025-04-24T15:30:55,5
You cannot get more unamerican that ignoring the constitution.     Disappearing people in the US should be a 'straight to jail' offense.,faith_apnea,2025-04-24T15:27:41,3
"I worked for the government. The government makes mistakes all the time. Bad supervisors cover up mistakes in order to not face consequences. With any government action it is vital to have a review of the action outside of that agency. Why? Because other people within the agency will cover up for the bad supervisor rather than admit the mistake. Deporting people (Americans and immigrants) needs to be reviewed by a court. When mistakes are made, they must be corrected. No cover ups. Anyone whose okay with letting immigrants be deported without evidence and review is naive.",FiveUpsideDown,2025-04-24T16:10:59,3

"I would like to point out for the Trump voter conservative who likes to think of themselves as Christians (even when they are far from it) that might lurking in the shadows reading this thread that what you guys are doing is not what I believe Jesus would do.    My understanding of the Bible leads me to believe that Jesus would not look at a vulnerable immigrant who is lurking in the shadows minding their business and trying to make a living with half the minimum wage while being treated like an animal on the job (simply because their bosses can) just so that they can send money home for their parent or child's life saving surgery and say yup you deserve life in the death camp for this.    Magas can't decide whether Abrego is a gang member, gang leader or the cartel as long as it is a bad label that makes it hard for the public to defend him. No one is perfect, however, constantly voting for someone who will hurt as many people as possible who aren't you so that you can feel privileged watching other humans being shackled and treated like animals is just wrong.   I am a proud Christian, far from perfect, and definitely did not vote for Trump. This situation is hard to forgive when there is no end in sight in the destruction of the democracy, and the destruction to thousands if not millions of lives",Effective_Extreme642,2025-04-26T07:12:47,1

"In all fairness we did try to use the insurrection clause, which was about the civil war, to take Trump off the ballot. Laws don't stop being relevant while they are still on the books.   For the record, I agree with NONE of what's going on here, but not because the law is from 1798.",Ridry,2025-04-24T15:14:46,17

I won't quibble over concentration and death camps. There were over 100 camps. Only 13 were in Germany.  Arguably the most notable was Auschwitz and it was in Poland.,ianrl337,2025-04-24T18:47:18,9

"Maybe I don’t understand the definition of scapegoating very well, but I feel like if a government goes “these people are undesirable/dangerous so we are sending them to a concentration camp” feels like they’re placing the blame on the people going to the concentration camp",Hufflepuff_23,2025-04-24T19:51:41,0
You can call it what you want but I lived in Germany and I’ve seen the “concentration camps” as they called them in Germany where they had gun ranges that they lined up Jews for target practice. Gas chambers and mass incinerators. You can post all the Wikipedia pages you want but I’ve been to them. I’ve been to dachau 5 times.,Ghost_Sapper,2025-04-24T18:50:55,40

"...you clearly have no idea what victim blaming is.  You're not blaming someone for something, punishing them, and that punishment turns them into a victim.  Victim blaming is when you blame the victim of a crime for that crime. Like when you blame a woman who gets raped by saying she was dressed for it.",mithridateseupator,2025-04-25T01:05:37,3
"You see, all of the talk of them being “undesirable” is the false premise that GOP has pushed that the groups they dislike are to blame for our economic and societal woes. I’m sure you’ve heard of the “Immigrants are taking jobs” or “LGBT people are destroying society”. That’s the scapegoating. Victim blaming is a different thing. For example: Victim blaming would be like blaming someone who got robbed for not having a good enough door lock.",P1xelHunter78,2025-04-24T19:55:56,2
"Even Wikipedia is on your side. Over 30,000 documented deaths occurred at Dachau.  Nobody who has ever been to Dachau would not call it a death camp.",OkFigaroo,2025-04-24T19:21:17,29

"Idk I’d say sending people to concentration camps kinda seems like a crime, and then saying they deserve it because they are “undesirable”, seems like blaming them to me. I was just commenting on how that specific definition seems to put the blame on the people going to the concentration camp based on the wording of calling them undesirable/dangerous  Edit to add: I don’t mean that the act of sending someone to a concentration camp is victim blaming. I mean this specific definition.",Hufflepuff_23,2025-04-25T07:25:43,1
