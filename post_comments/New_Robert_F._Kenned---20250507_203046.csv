"""60,000 additional files related to the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy are now online at [http://archives.gov/rfk](http://archives.gov/rfk). After the initial release of 10,000 documents three weeks ago, we searched FBI and CIA warehouses for any records not previously turned over to The National Archives. More than 60,000 documents were discovered, declassified, and digitized for public viewing. Today's release is an important step toward maximum transparency, finding the truth, and sharing the truth.""",MadOblivion,2025-05-07T20:31:15,3
