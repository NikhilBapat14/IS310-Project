“As President Trump brings manufacturing back to the US…” everything we need to know in the first sentence,TuringGPTy,2025-05-04T12:03:50,46
"Sure thing, Shelly.  Like China doesn't have 191 *other* countries ready and willing to buy their essential manufactured parts and components.  America can withhold *what* that is necessary for China's economy to survive?   Bombast? Bullshit? Bullying?  Almonds, maybe?  Our technology is widely dispersed throughout the planet whether or not that's been authorized for that purpose.  Our manufacturing is Mom and Pop level compared to the rest of the world, and our military hasn't won a war in three generations.   More to the point, Americans aren't prepared to sacrifice dog doodie in service of trump's folly; we scream bloody murder if our screens go out for fifteen minutes.  Take away our fast feed, and everyone would starve to death before they bothered to learn how to cook a pot of beans and  greens. And heavens forfend the water goes out when they turn on the faucet-- those 350 million firearms ain't gonna sit idle in the closet for long. . .

"Huh. Interesting. I wonder why they think that?   This trade war, coupled with Trump’s dismantling of our soft-power structure, has handed China an enormous win. The rest of the world is going to form new alliances without us, and China will be at the center of it. They’ll be able to open whole new markets.  They’ve also made it clear that they have ZERO intention of negotiating with Trump. [They could hardly have been more clear on this.](https://youtu.be/Db0fR6dPQNo?si=64bMqyXGZuqk6P4d)  Japan’s negotiating tactic is to threaten to sell off [1 Trillion dollars in treasury bonds](https://youtu.be/ECArVLg8BJU?si=qUIR_i76D-9OtEcX) if Trump doesn’t pull his head out of his arse. This will crash the economy far worse than Trump already has. China holds an enormous amount of US debt too.   When you hear Trump say he holds all the cards, this is a great example of just how utterly wrong he is.

Countries other than China are negotiating to mitigate the impact of tariffs, while the US is “negotiating” to extract more benefits from other countries.

No one will accept a permanent blank check to the United States.

Anyone with half a brain can see that China has the upper hand.  All of Trump’s tough guy bravado bullshit works when you’re a hack real estate developer but not when you’re the leader of a developed nation.  You can’t just say you’re cutting hundreds of deals without China because there’s only so many countries and most of them are already talking with China.  Definitely agree this has to be hilarious for Xi to watch Trump squirm and constantly embarrass himself.  He 100% knows all he has to do is let Trump cook for a bit and Trump will give him everything to make the embarrassment stop.

Almost all rare earth metals America uses come from China with pretty much no alternative source.

"I'd argue that his massive (undeserved) ego is secondary only to his greed.

They're already raking in billions-- can trillions be far behind?  (And of course, he's going to donate all that bribe money to the UST, right?  Just like J.P.

"I work for a small company and we manufacture a product that is officially “Made in America.” We put the sticker on it and everything. The definition of “made in America” is kind of vague and it only requires that the item in question be produced here and for the “majority” of the materials used (no exact percentages or anything) be sourced from here as well.  That said, some of the shit we use comes from China. There’s just no way around it. There literally isn’t an American manufacturer for that particularly part. Whatever we can buy here or make ourselves we do, but even when we buy from someone else in the states often times *they* use materials they get from China.  That’s just how global trade works. I mean, we sell the product we manufacture around the world as well. We have customers in probably 25%-50% of the countries on any given continent (excluding Antarctica).

"Also China is slowing production while selling US treasury bonds to fund stimulus spending and supports at the cost of the USD.  Japan has also been selling its bond reserves and has now put the rest of its reserves on the table as a bargaining chip. It is a hand of aces to Trump's jokers.  Between these nations they have the ability to crush the bond market and the USD. They could easily start a run as other nations and major investors scramble to get out before all value is lost.  It is the equivalent of mutually assured destruction and is a risk that cannot be taken by the US.  This slowing of production has yet to deliver the supply shock to the US economy but it is closing rapidly as empty ships return to US ports.  Rare earths are the pointy tip of this trade war and will cripple US manufacturing. Retailers will be facing empty shelves and tariffs on raw materials such as steel and aluminium will add to the cost of manufactured products.  Trump has united China in a nationalist fervour with his insults and attacks. As long as China can continue to feed its population it will be able to hold out.  It does not have much in the way of internal political pressures compared with the USA. Neither does it have a very large number of armed civilians and militia threatening state security.  The global economy is well overdue for a cyclic economic recession which is being accelerated by Trump.  If he is gambling on a quick recovery from economic recession, as it has done so in the past, then this will be made an impossibility if it loses its bond market.  History has shown the USA being often first into recession and first out , on an average turnaround of 3.5 years. This has been enabled by an attractive bond market which raises the capital necessary for stimulus spending.  Without it the USA will have great difficulty in extracting itself out of economic recession and risks sinking into a deep economic depression.  Vulture capitalists therefore cannot profit from a short turnaround from recession and a devalued USD makes offshore investment more costly.  Trump has backed the USA into a corner with his daft scattergun approach to global trade. Tariffs are at best a threat to be used at the tail end of trade discussions. Trump decided to shoot his load first in the expectation that the world would come grovelling for a deal.  He no longer has a credible threat in his pocket because he has fired it off at the beginning and now has nothing else left to bargain with.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-04T19:09:06,1
