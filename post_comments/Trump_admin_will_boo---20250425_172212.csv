Oil companies don't want to boost production.. As far as I understand it. There's a sweet spot for making money. Like 60 - 70 a barrel. Demand has to meet supply for that to be possible.,NATO_Will_Prevail,2025-04-25T17:27:49,8

Iirc 60 bucks a barrel is the break even point for oil production in the US. Anything less then that and it's not worth pumping,UghFudgeBwana,2025-04-25T18:04:42,2
"Not right now for sure...I was reading oil was floating closer and closer to 60 a barrel right now because of the stupid trade war?   They arent gonna lose money to get the oil out...gonna be ""plug baby plug"" soon enough if it keeps dropping",blues111,2025-04-25T17:29:08,3
"Yeah demand is down because of the trade war and supply is up as, IIRC, OPEC just increased production.   The issue with gas prices is also related to refineries, not really the amount of oil being pumped. A bunch of refineries closed under Trump's first term and never reopened because it wasn't profitable enough.",CassadagaValley,2025-04-25T18:00:52,2
