"If they're not being granted due process, it's not deportation.    If they're being sent to a country they've never been to before, it's not deportation.    It's kidnapping.  Let's call it what it is, and not let the media sugarcoat what's really happening.",Machiavvelli3060,2025-05-07T12:31:13,19
The amount of leaking that is still happening in spite of their efforts is quite comical at this point.   Its like the email Zuckerberg sent about going after leakers that someone then immediately leaked lol,coatofforearm,2025-05-07T12:26:15,7
"""The Trump administration is planning to deport migrants without legal status to Libya –a country long plagued by armed conflict – a U.S. official has confirmed to NPR.  The official was not authorized to speak publicly about the plans, but the news comes days after reports Trump was eyeing the North African nation, as well as other African countries including Benin, Angola, and Eswatini, as places to send deportees.  Earlier this week, Rwanda's foreign minister confirmed the East African country was in talks with Washington about the same issue. All these countries have notorious human rights records.""  Without due process, this is just human trafficking.",zrv8psgOS9AiWK6ugbt2,2025-05-07T12:20:20,5
