"Taxation...is...theft?   This is a line of thinking that kills me, because it implies someone has done absolutely zero interrogation into what they actually bring to the table, on a social scale. Someone considering taxes ""theft"" must never have walked on a sidewalk or enjoyed the (relative, dubious) safety offered by police and emergency services. They must have never gone to a public school or had some vital function in their life performed by someone who did. They must be growing their own food, since subsidies are tax-funded. They must have no interest in a national defense of *any* kind, smaller or otherwise.   Someone who considers taxes theft fails to understand that, in isolation, we are quite literally dead. Taxes are not ""theft,"" they are a contribution to the general welfare for the purpose of creating a rising tide that'll lift all the boats.   Even these rich folks whose money you feel so obliged to protect (another temporarily embarrassed billionaire, I guess) are *nothing* without the droves of employees actually conducting the work and creating value, and those employees come to work on paved roads and probably spent at least a little time in public school.   Theft is *not* paying your taxes and leaving hungry children all over the country without school lunch so Elon Musk can drill holes in monkey skulls to stick his toxic tech in there.

It‚Äôs abhorrent that you even consider this view acceptable and even worse that you advocate for it. If taxes are X% they should be X% for the rich as well.,Indurum,2025-05-09T19:41:59,2
"I‚Äôm not sure why you‚Äôre moralizing my position with words like abhorrent. We have a slightly different worldview and that‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt even fully disagree with your view. I‚Äôm okay with whatever we define as the rich paying a slightly higher percentage, but not too high, and I‚Äôd also like to see lower income people pay fewer taxes.",_santi20,2025-05-09T19:47:58,0
