"Even Trump’s lapdog judges don’t have the stomach for these grotesque abominations to the Constitution.  Think about how far you have to go outside the bounds of judicial decency to make even these pathetic tools buck and say, “No!”",Beantown-Jack,2025-04-24T21:23:11,10
"And yet, he is still there. What do you want to bet they don't obey the judge?",SatoriFound70,2025-04-24T23:18:58,7
"Here we go again. Maybe we should stop deporting undocumented immigrants to countries they did not come from. If taking them to their country of origin would be a threat on their life, then maybe we should give them asylum as refugees like we did in the first place. This anti-brown people sentiment has gone rabid.",invalidpassword,2025-04-24T21:28:26,5
Trump tomorrow: a so-called judge and a RINO!,Raul1024,2025-04-24T21:29:05,3
Legal system takes time especially in these unprecedented situations. I have faith we will chart new pathways to enforcement but that can’t happen overnight sadly,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-25T04:54:34,2
"It is unprecedented in that never has a President enacted the alien enemies act, declared a group of immigrants as gang members even thought a majority had no criminal record in the US and then deported them to a maximum security prison in a foreign country that is not their own.  Trump made a deal to house prisoners in CECOT then there is absolutely no reason he can’t get them back. They aren’t charged with any crimes in El Salvador or the US and Garcia is the one who is a citizen of El Salvador and the other 238 are from Venezuela.  Even typing this out I cringe at how many federal and international laws have been broken",Quirky_Fly_5452,2025-04-25T05:14:47,4
I’m with you. It’s a horror show,Front-Lime4460,2025-04-25T05:28:45,3
