"Biden tried to forgive student loans, then developed an income driven repayment plan that eventually would result if forgiveness, but why would the Trump administration do any of that when they can completely screw over people who aren’t earning enough to support their payments?",ddr1ver,2025-04-22T12:25:08,9
"I'm calling to pay mine off with a credit card next week.   I'd rather owe a bank money via revolving credit at 24% than owe this administration a fucking dime that they'll use to justify, at best, garnishing my wages for the next 60 years or, at worst, deporting me.   Plus, if there's any fuckery involved in the payoff I'd rather have a bank backing me on the charge back since it's their money and therefore their skin in the game.   Fuck Trump and Republicans ",Spam_Hand,2025-04-22T12:40:21,7
"So, the income driven repayment plan is being cut?",No-Flatworm-404,2025-04-22T15:11:40,2
Don't do it.  If you're committed to refinancing look into something like sofi.    Don't pay 24% interest,Cultural-Avocado-218,2025-04-22T12:56:31,6
I took the tax hit and took money out of my 401k to pay off mine. It was right before the big dip in the stock market so I would have lost the money anyway. I was on the fence about whether I should do it or not. With the latest news I’m glad I did. Got the letter from the dept of ed last week congratulating me on paying off my loans. One less thing to worry about in Trump’s dystopian American downfall.,omgirl76,2025-04-22T14:43:37,2
Who says they plan on paying?,Elmer_Whip,2025-04-22T13:49:25,2
If paid off via credit cards would it be off their record after 7 years? I know bankruptcy wouldn't work because they inspect the root of the debt.,necromantzer,2025-04-22T14:56:22,1
