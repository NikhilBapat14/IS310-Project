"Agreed at this point. Trump can only blame Biden for song long. I like the coverage today by the big news outlets stating retailers are already consulting with bankruptcy lawyers and declaring Christmas 2025 is going to be a real ""a Christmas carol"" as orders for holiday items need to be placed very soon for a November/December delivery and the tariffs and uncertainty will probably see empty shelves or incredible prices or both for toys, decorations, and holiday staples.   I honestly would look forward to a Christmas 2025 with no inventory, barren shelves and 200% more expensive on in stock items. The look on all the fake gop/maga Christian faces would be worth it.   When the people who only have a Walmart and dollar general to shop at within a 2 hour drive make that trip and find empty shelves.   I'm working on projects already contracted until the end of the year so I'm talking shit right now. But you're gonna see a lot of laid off workers in the transportation sector. Truckers, dock workers, freight brokers. I'd imagine diesel demand will be down if trucks are moving freight and ships are in port.   I'd imagine big retailers will be laying off as well as they struggle. Walmart, target, Home Depot, Amazon.   I see utility rates continue to spike as transformers and other switch gear made overseas become $$$. I mean the majority of residential breakers and panels are made in Mexico. Lighting equipment made in China. Electrical connectors and fittings are made in China and India. Lumber goods going up with tariffs on Canadian lumber products and Canadian raw lumber. So home repairs, remodels and new construction all going up. I think even the majority of fasteners are manufactured overseas anymore.  I see commercial buildings and schools failing to source replacement hvac equipment or source affordable hvac equipments. I see this happening for residential as well.   My largest personal concern is sourcing coffee in the future. We are totally reliant on foreign producers and import for coffee due to environmental factors.

"Because we are a net importer, by a lot, so our own tariffs affect us more than other countries‚Äô tariffs affect us.   If we lowered our tariffs then Americans will have more money to spend on goods and services. The people affected by other countries‚Äô tariffs are American exporters, and really only if the item has a USA country of origin.   If we lowered our tariffs then we could ask countries to do the same. They would lower them if the reason for the tariff is in retaliation to ours, and they would keep them if the tariff was for a different purpose than retaliation. Even if they had that other reason, then we still benefit more from lower consumer prices.   I think the main problem exporters face is how strong the USD is relative to other currencies, which makes our products very expensive in other countries in general without relation to tariffs.   And that‚Äôs one thing Trump has right about China. They do a lot to artificially depress their currency, which makes products from China cheaper than they might otherwise be for people spending USD.
