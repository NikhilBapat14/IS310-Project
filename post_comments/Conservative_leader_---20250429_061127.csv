"Pierre Poilievre lost the seat he held since 28 June 2004. In an adjacent riding (constituency), Prime Minister Mark Carney won his first ever political race – getting 63.7% of the vote in his riding of Nepean.    Poilievre was the 6th leader of the Conservative Party of Canada in the past 10 years. The party will probably be looking for their 7th.   A ""Canadian Trump"" was not such a good idea for the Conservatives.",clamorous_owle,2025-04-29T07:33:24,58
What? There are no “progressives” in Canada to stab liberals in the back?,Thumbkeeper,2025-04-29T06:32:36,20
"Kind of ironic considering what the political map looked like even in January. But none the less, I still laugh at said irony. Congratulations Canada for making the right choice and sorry for our stupid leaders. Looking to fix some of that in 2026",PlatformStatus8749,2025-04-29T13:23:43,2
"I honestly think that the Conservative party is going to wait a while to decide whether to go with Poilievre or replace him. They have seen that he can be effective when the country is unhappy with the current leadership (PP had huge support when Trudeau was in power), so they will bide their time until they can see how popular of a leader Carney is going to be. If Carney ends up being similar to Trudeau and the country is turning on him within a few years, then they will march out PP as the leader to say ""See, I told you so..."" and he will pick up where he left off before January 2025. Otherwise, if Carney maintains popular support, they will force PP out and replace him with someone more moderate who can capture the centre voters.",DystopianAdvocate,2025-04-29T12:37:54,6
"Err, this is awkward but the Canadian conservative party is historically more like US Dems than the Liberal party is, liberals have traditionally been more centre-left (whereas dems have trended towards center/center-right). Its only recently that the conservatives pushed further right and flirted with Trump style conservative populism while liberals expanded their tent.  But also you do understand how parliamentary elections work? There is a progressive party, the New Democratic Party, or NDP. They dont need to hide in another partys tent or fight eachother, they run independently and win separately without generally harming the liberals chances and vice versa (and where theres risk of conservatives winning they often agree not to compete for the same riding (district) and endorse eachother).  About 10 years back they were (briefly) the second largest party in Canada behind the conservatives, after the liberals failed a no-confidence motion to defeat the Conservative government (twice) and then subsequently changed leadership and abandoned their opposition coalition to support the Conservative government, and then subsequently collapsed due to widespread dissatisfaction with their actions.   Trudeau subsequently pulled the entire party left and ate the NDPs vote share by challenging them on progressive principals to dominate Canadian politics for the past decade. NDP has continued bleeding votes to the Liberals and has basically become irrelevant because the Liberals have basically main-streamed modern progressive policy. NDP was briefly poised to again become the second largest party but  thanks to Trumps hostile rhetoric and the selection of Mark Carney as party leader, NDP support collapsed fully, because he attracted a lot of vote share from the NDP progressives for his own progressive views, but also some from the conservatives - who previously tried to draft him to hold office under Steven Harpers conservative government in 2012.  Anyway, all that to say - whatever argument you thought you were making doesnt work for a whole host of reasons.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-29T11:02:21,9
"From what I've followed it seems to me that Carney is also just seen as a good candidate during a time of economic instability because he ran two central banks (Canadian and British).  I may profoundly distrust modern mainstream economics (neoliberal/neoclassical, whatever you want to call it), but when you run a central bank you're doing the actual practical work of managing a large portion of a nation's economy. Whether the theory you learn in university is any good really doesn't matter at that point. He seems like a good choice at this time in history.",PolygonMan,2025-04-29T11:43:35,6
"Yes, I broadly agree with that and am slightly envious of the potential opportunity Canada has here.  He seems to broadly understand many of the key financial and economic issues that progressives care about in a way that cuts through the moral relativism and bs grandstanding that have hindered progressive economic policy in the US (and I say that as an American progressive) and can communicate those issues in a direct way that cuts through to just sound policy that makes sense in a way that even moderates and potentially conservatives can appreciate.  If he can actually implement meaningful policy change in alignment with his views, Canada stands to set itself up for decades of prosperity.",chaos0xomega,2025-04-29T12:47:28,3
