"If it wasn't for Biden's shameless appeasement of the Republican party, we wouldn't be having this conversation. He instilled no sense of urgency in pursuing the legal cases against Trump, and allowed the Republicans to pretend like Trump isn't the result of decades of political fuckery.  He was willing to risk what we're going through now in the interest of preserving the pre-Trump status quo.  And that's not to mention all the ways he kneecapped the Harris campaign because they were concerned about his fragile ego. if she was too critical.    Fuck Trump and all, but we've known Trump was a Putin fan for almost a decade. Last person we need to hear from Biden stating the obvious.",MR_TELEVOID,2025-05-07T09:36:05,11
"What about Biden's appeasement of Republicans after they staged a coup?   Fuck off, Biden. If you hadn't let trump get away with his attack on the country, we wouldn't be in this situation. ",Bakedads,2025-05-07T09:42:45,6
"Biden, I know you're old buddy, but surely you can remember that trump is nothing more than Putin's play thing",LW_GLAZER,2025-05-07T09:15:37,2
"Indeed appeasement of a authoritarian/murderous government is a foolish thing to do, wether it's Putin or Bibi. And before someone claims ""you should've voted for her"", I did, but I also knew that the Biden/Harris administrations unwavering commitment to Bibi Would unnecessarily cost them very important votes. White House admins, of both major parties, have shown that Yes U.S. Presidents Do/Can/Should influence a nation we Arm to the teeth and shield from international law.",PresidentBreeblebrox,2025-05-07T10:03:28,0

"I think there’s a large bloc of the Democratic Party that just wants to freeze things right on the day before Trump descended the escalator and just keep it that way forever. They have a rose colored glasses view of things where Obama had solved race and Obergefell had solved LGBT rights (and they have no time for the QIA+, or really that much for the T) and they view this loss to Trump again as a chance to reorient and shake off the people trying to make even incremental progress.",CatgirlApocalypse,2025-05-07T13:48:46,2
