"""NPR speaks with Katya Schwenk, a reporter at investigative news outlet ""The Lever,"" about a memo outlining the Trump administration's use of a refugee fund to resettle white South Africans in the U.S.""   Ohhh so the issue was all the others weren't white!

"My wife is a South African immigrant. A lot of her friends are too. She has family still there. The reality is that the government is incredibly racist to white South Africans. There is employment discrimination to an incredible degree, same with in education and many other public services. The police are corrupt and won‚Äôt help white South Africans. The streets are dangerous for everyone but if you‚Äôre white you‚Äôre a target.   I know this administration doesn‚Äôt have good intentions, but I actually wholeheartedly support this. I hope I can get my MIL and SIL here more easily as a result. My wife gets her citizenship next month and doesn‚Äôt ever plan on going back except limited visits when our kids are old enough, and she doesn‚Äôt even want them to get dual citizenship because she doesn‚Äôt want them going back.",healthierlurker,2025-05-08T09:16:15,-10
They couldn‚Äôt attract immigrants from European countries. So Trump probably felt he had a better chance to try and attract whites in S. Africa. The idea probably came from Leon. I can just hear the table talk reasoning between the two.,janzeera,2025-05-08T09:35:58,8

The weirdest thing about it is the majority of South Africans are doing this to them for absolutely no reason right? üòÇ it‚Äôs almost like the white South Africans had done something super uncool to black South Africans.,Most_Technology557,2025-05-08T11:06:27,2

Wow‚Ä¶. Did you just claim 12 million people are terrorists/gang affiliates or otherwise somehow less desirable simply for being born in a country you likely know nothing about?  Waste of a human.,Jumpy-Coffee-Cat,2025-05-08T09:01:20,12

Lmaooo right apartheid ended in the 90s. There are no ancestors here. The MIL he desperately wants to import very much existed during that time as an adult and benefitted from it if not actively participated. What a joke.,sushiwalrus,2025-05-09T15:41:55,1
