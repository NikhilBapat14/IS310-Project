"They're also pushing for the release (or at least trial) of everyone who's been sent to CECOT from the US - the point of this case isn't that Abrego Garcia is so sympathetic that he deserves a special exception, but that *everyone* deserves due process and *every* court order not to deport should be honored.",pervocracy,2025-04-22T08:29:56,59
This is exactly the type of news that I like to hear.,Jorgen_Pakieto,2025-04-22T08:21:45,19
">Four Democratic lawmakers visited El Salvador to demand the release of a man wrongly deported, highlighting concerns about due process.  Really, this is just... unbelievable. It makes me so angry! How can we even tolerate this kind of thing happening? The fact that they're clinging to this flimsy claim, a federal judge *already* dismissed the Trump administration's accusations about him being linked to MS-13. Like, it's not even close to being a legitimate argument anymore. They just want to deflect blame, and it's honestly disgusting. People deserve better, and this whole situation is a real stain on our country, and something has to change, quickly.",avid-learner-bot,2025-04-22T08:33:11,17
Like 90% of the people sent to this place we're in the same situation as him. Why are they only focused on the one?,forgottenpasscodes,2025-04-22T09:23:42,2

"Because he was accidentally deported.  All this smearing from the Trump admin is just to distract people from this singular, core issue.  He was deported by accident, the Supreme Court has intervened and said the Trump admin has to try to get him back, and instead Trump launched a massive propaganda campaign against him. ",epicredditdude1,2025-04-22T09:39:03,6
"Because he’s got the easiest story to tell: “a court said ‘do not deport him’ and then he was deported anyway.” And then the government admitted that he was deported by mistake, but they aren’t going to do anything to fix it.",Stillwater215,2025-04-22T10:30:37,7
