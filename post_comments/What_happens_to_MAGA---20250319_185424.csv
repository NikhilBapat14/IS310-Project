The cultural/economic/demographic forces that are driving MAGA will not go away  MAGA itself? That’s more up in the air. You’re correct in saying Trump has a successor problem. The Kingfish’s movement didn’t outlive the Kingfish,ttown2011,2025-03-20T08:25:18,411

"Short: maga fades. We go back to Canadians as allies and fighting over Healthcare.  Long version: Even if Trump doesn't die of old age or taking poor care of himself this term, it's improbable that he'll get a third term.   It wouldn't just take changing the constitution to get him elected for a third term, they'd also have to backpeddle on allllllll of their ""Bidens too old & incompetent"" ""its evidence of a deepstate"" rhetoric. And they'd have to have the support of public opinion and/or rig the election. Rigging the election without the support of public opinion is a BAD idea. If it's not at least close, they've already laid the groundwork for legal justification (patriots, they said) for storming the capital to overturn a rigged election. And if there's evidence, and it can be proven in court- forget about it. Especially -  If they end this term, delivering:  - lower taxes for the wealth class - higher taxes to the working class - lower services for the working class - higher deficit - no peace in Gaza or Ukraine - higher inflation & cost of living - restrictions on anti-gov free speech - global instability (ex. Threatening to Annex Canada) - disruptions in social security and Medicaid  - handover of the government to an unelected ultra rich deepstate and an admin & faith teams riddled with child abuse SA accusations  They won't win. Because, with the exception of lower wealth tax, he promised the opposite.  He even screwed over the crypto space by establishing a federal BTN reserve using CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE (gov theft, which both parties used to oppose before maga hijacked the conscience of the right) and not federal investment, which would've caused the coins value to rise. Instead, people began dumping after the announcement in fear.   There's a portion of his base who'd let him shoot someone in the street, but it's not anywhere near enough for a popular vote. That same base is loyal to him individually, and if he goes, their support folds. It took over 16 years for Trump to garner that level of support. Even if he handpicked someone and passed it off to them (which he probably won't, because he's not likely to give away his power), they wouldn't be Trump. This cult likes Donald J. Trump. It won't be the same.   Remember, they couldn't even get consecutive terms last time with Trump, and they threw everything they had at it.   Maga won by not being the establishment. Well, now maga's the establishment. And their establishment sucks. They became everything they ever said they were against.  Putin, Hitler, comparatively very young men compared to Trump at this point in their takeover and those democracies were both much less established than the US. Putin couldn't pull off the career of Putin starting at this age, the centuries old well established American brand as a melting pot democracy just makes it that much harder.   I think post-trump maga fades. But the brains behind him will just retreat into their swamp and brood on their failings. Then they'll come out again with a rebrand. Probably as anti-tech bro libertarians. Which would be kind of fun. [Newsweek reported in Feb of this year that Steve Bannon called Musk a ""[Parasitic Ilegal Immigrant](https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-escalates-feud-elon-musk-parasitic-illegal-immigrant-2032675)""].""

"> Trump can’t run again unless he wants to add an amendment to the constitution and I really doubt that 2/3rds of Congress and two-thirds of states would vote for that amendment to pass. (Although weirder things have happened).  The premise of your question relies on the presupposition that Trump cares about abiding by the Constitution. At the end of the day, the Constitution has as much power to remove Trump from office as any other piece of paper.  We’re already in the world where Trump is violating the Constitution and Rule of Law. TROs are being violated. He signed an EO unilaterally reinterpreting the 14th Amendment. His Admin argues the Executive has (judicial) authority to interpret laws. He’s fired “disloyal” executive workers. He’s stacking the executive with loyalists and removing internal checks - especially in the military!  Most egregious was his attempt to steal the 2020 election through his fake elector scheme. When Pence didn’t play ball, he had his sycophants commit an insurrection. Nonetheless, the public reelected him. The very people who the Constitution draws its authority from reelected someone who proved his adversarial, undemocratic, fascistic nature with regard to the Constitution and Rule of Law.  So I ask you: Why should we assume Trump will abide by the Constitution and leave office when the people democratically rewarded his open hostility to the Constitution?",BettisBus,2025-03-20T09:04:14,20

Trump will find a way to hold onto power and get he presidency beyond 2028 and anyone who thinks otherwise is either partly delusional or just completely insane. Term limits (and laws in general) mean nothing to a devil like Trump.,DoctaMonsta,2025-03-20T14:17:11,6

Then they will declare the whole election invalid because the blue states will refuse to put Trump on the ballot, and they will say that’s denying the will of the people.  It sounds crazy, but he already tried to do something like this once, why not do it again? Who will stop him? Certainly not his party. Not the military that he commands.

"If Trump is alive, he'll declare himself President for a third term, and no one will stop him. There's no other plausible eventuality.   But even if he dies before then, fascism is here to stay. Trump has always just been a symptom. Yeah, there's something about him that the right seems to worship, but they didn't get their beliefs *from* Trump. Rather, Trump got his beliefs from the same place they did - the half a century of right wing propaganda flooding television, radio, and more recently the internet.  So there will be infighting, no doubt, and there may not be a single figurehead who's able to step into Trump's place, but the propaganda will still go out, the MAGAs will still rabidly consume it, and infighting aside, the GOP will continue to transform the country into their own version of Russia.",Mjolnir2000,2025-03-20T03:31:22,58

He/she will break every campaign promise. They won’t care.  As long as the candidate is mad as h..l and no longer going take what has been done to the  working class. They want revenge. They want retribution. They want to stop using energy sources other than coal. Steel will be the biggest employer in the US.   They demand the jobs pay six figure salaries. Positions that hire unskilled and undereducated workers who have never spent a day learning or improving skills. Companies who refuse to hire with diversity or born in another country.   They think skill and knowledge are not very useful. All you need is to be a hard worker. They don’t realize smart people are hard workers also.

"The cult that Trump has is not new or unique. Rush Limbaugh had the same cult for almost 30 years. He made it ok to lie, to be racist, sexist, arrogant, and willfully ignorant. He got rich off of hate radio. Rush became the defacto leader of the GOP when President GHW Bush personally carried his bags into the White House for his Lincoln bedroom stay.  The conservatives and evangelicals also swooned over Rush, just like they are for Trump. They also discarded facts and reason, just like they are now for Trump.  Trump is just the result of decades of Rush Limbaugh, not the cause of MAGA. Once Trump is gone, the cult will find another demagogue to swoon over and follow.  edit: the current xenophobia against minorities and immigrants is also not new or unique.

"Here are some interesting articles I found online when I was trying to figure out why everything keeps getting worse in America. I looked in a couple legal dictionaries and I couldn't find a legal framework for capitalism. I did find a legal definition for employer and employee and capitalist. There is very little difference between Democrats and Republicans and every one of them passed laws bad for the working class. They all made it easier for the rich to get richer.   The United States is a debt based economy and that's something else worth researching. As far as I can tell, the country has been in debt since the Civil War. There's been a huge amount of depressions throughout history and the system perpetuates poverty and FDR was the only president in history that ever created jobs during a depression but the national parks were created by stealing even more land from the natives. Every one of them.   I also included the Notes on the State of Virginia by Thomas Jefferson because he defines Savage and it is really important to understand because they were never violent. Jefferson admired the natives and called them savages for having smaller Confederacies. Look up the Great Law of Peace if you're interested. The United States copied their constitution and you will see a ton of similarities including a supreme court, and freedom of speech and religion and more. And it was written in 1154 and was a true participatory democracy. Our history is completely false and that's why it keeps repeating itself.  Dictionary.com has the best definition of capitalism and I think it makes a good argument for Socialism.   ""an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means of wealth.""  Cooperatively is the most important part here. Corporations don't own the means of production in socialist systems. That's why they are demonized here. Profit comes from paying us less money. Capitalists will go to war against their own people to keep their systems in place.   Labor wars https://www.nps.gov/blrv/learn/historyculture/200-labor-events.htm  And it's not just the presidents, Congress and the Supreme Court side with corporations and they've removed a lot of protections we had in the past. The Supreme Court made a decision in 2010 that allowed unlimited campaign financing. And the Supreme Court has lifetime appointments. Congress has elections every 2 years but it doesn't seem to matter who's in there. There's no free market and the debt has been a problem for a couple hundred years.   The neverending war economy has been devastating for everyone especially everyone involved including friends of mine who have severe brain cancer from burn pits and others who have died by suicide. War is the largest export. See Thomas Jefferson's letter to John Taylor for more about war and the Supreme Court too.   There's also a serious problem with all media outlets except for some of the independent media outlets. Everyone needs to research medical articles about fear-based narratives. If you want more background look up Edward Bernays and Leo Strauss. 6 companies own every media outlet in the country and they all use fear-based tactics to manipulate people increasing anxiety and mental health conditions. News and social media are making all age groups unable to engage with each other in a constructive manner. It's really important to trace the source to the original context. There's no background information and most of the sources are not legit. The pubmed articles are the best but Cambridge and other universities are good too. I searched ""fear media"" and sorted by most relevant.

"MAGA will die with Trump.  MAGA operates like a literal cult. They're a group characterized by unusual and extreme beliefs, centered around a leader with a strong cult of personality, where members exhibit excessive devotion and are often isolated themselves into a bubble, leading to manipulation and control.  Everything in MAGA starts and ends with Trump, he is everything. He's for all intents and purposes, treated like a prophet. He can do no wrong, and his supporters will defended him no matter no nonsensical, harmful, or hypocritical his words are. They will follow him no matter what he does or what he says.   This type of devotion is very strong, it's borderline worship. However, because it is so powerful, it will be hard for anybody else to take his place. A religion cannot replace their prophet, and so these people will still follow Trump even if he died. Even if there are candidates poised to succeed Trump or if Trump handpicks a replacement, it won't matter at all. The moment Trump dies, MAGA will be a shell of it's former self.   Whichever leader comes next is going to lose a lot of the base, and the movement will fracture. Every new leader is going to be criticized for not being more like Trump. The movement's fanatics will still try to cling on to what they had and they will do their best to return to their glory days, but it will all be in vain. With time, this movement will fade, and it will be remembered as a weird blip in American history.",AVeryBadMon,2025-03-21T21:47:33,1

"That assumes the GOP acts in at least a little bit of good faith, which seems optimistic and/or generous.  Here is the play:   ---They claim the 22nd Amendment doesn't really apply to Trump because it only applies to consecutive terms. This flies in the face of the actual text, but there are already MAGA-adjacent legal pundits msking this argument with a straight face.   ---Then, when states (rightly) call this argument BS and try to keep Trump off the ballot, his people can claim that by the logic of the Insurrection Clause case, states have no power to enforce 21st Amendment in the absence of specific enabling legislation. Again, this is insane troll logic, but has just enough of a veneer of legality that they can sell it on Fox (and maybe get 5 votes in SCOTUS).  ---And trying to keep Trump off the ballot? That sounds a lot like election interference--so he can have Kash Patel send the FBI to ""secure"" the election by arresting opponents, intimidating voters and election workers, etc. Trump will have an opponent, to be sure, but Trump will work hard to make sure it's someone he can trust will lose (my money would be on RFK Jr. or Tulsi Gabbard).    ---In the end, it would come down to Congress, and he can lean on them to make sure that whatever happens on Election Day, they certify him as the victor.   This all sounds insane (and in many ways, it is), but this is how ""elections"" work in other authoritarian regimes.

During WWII there was a united front entirely. Our nation became one with great cause, but it did not last very long as following the war there was a strong increase in classification of people's.     The ideologies began to become confrontational again and came to a head during the civil rights era.    Now we're unable to go backwards.

"I think the fundamental issue with MAGA as a unified body is that it can only last for a very short time before it starts to break apart. We're already seeing it with the oligarchs vs the theocrats vs the tech bros vs the legacy Republicans and so on.  Trump has a few superpowers, many politicians on the right don't have them the way he does which makes it more unlikely a sucessor down the line achieves the same level of sucess as him:  1. His celebrity status and history with marketing have made him neigh impossible to touch when it comes to accountability. He's always able to market all of his failures and mistakes as another person's fault and get people to attack them.  2. He's so delusional that he comes across as genuine. A lot of MAGA buy his crap cause they feel he's being more genuine than the normal detached politican. Now a lot of this is fueled by power 1 but he also fervently believes whatever he thinks of at the moment, regardless of any contradictions of what he thought before.  3. Trumps regime is likely to fracture the U.S. as a single entity. The betrayal of California by Trump, the assault on Illinois by Trump, the interference and corruption of the federal government are already spurring ideas of independence in some states or desires to approach our neighbors to become part of their nations. I think that even if there is a Trump 2.0 they're power and reach won't be as powerful as Trumps.  4. MAGA, as it stands, is a cult of personality with Trump as the key player in the movement. He's the guy who managed to get the average idiot moving cause they believe in him and buy the hype. Once he dies, no matter who takes power, there will be massive discontent. MAGA won't accept any person of color, woman, or non Christian leader mixed with the fact even MAGA is starting to turn on the billionares who run the show. Once Trump dies, the infighting will tear the movement apart for years to come. It won't by any means get rid of any of the groups who make up MAGA, but their ability to unify effectively will only degrade from here.",Glass-Pain3562,2025-03-22T14:22:36,0

Whenever referring to him, everyone must always add ""may He live forever"" or something. There is some conversation he has with one of his sons and the idea of succession comes up, in which the tisroc responds something like ""if I live forever, which you obviously want, this shouldn't be an issue.""

"I suppose it depends on what you mean by ""allies""? I suppose that term might look differently in Washington than it does in Ottawa.  Ensuring our independence from the USA is Canada's #1 foreign policy imperative. It's been shaping our history since before Confederation. Naturally, we were quite happy to develop closer ties to the USA in the 1930s, especially since it was becoming increasingly apparent we couldn't rely on the British.  After 1945, we continued to grow closer, based on the assumption that the USA would be a reliable partner. We ran infrastructure between our countries and even merged aspects of our military defence, like with NORAD. We've also damaged other relationships, like that with China or Britain in order to keep the USA happy.  The Invasion of Iraq certainly damaged that trust, but Obama managed to paper over that to some extent. Trump's first term and the anemic reaction to his coup dealt a mortal blow though, and his first months in office have finished it off.  I'd also note that a lot of the hostility to the US as of late has been bottom-up. Canadians are generally feeling betrayed and anger and even anti-China sentiment has been eroding. There's going to be broad support for politicians that shift us away from the USA and towards other allies.     I do share your skepticism of France, though I wouldn't expect us to actually rely on them too much. Canadians are pretty good at flattering stronger countries and we do play them off against each other when we can. It's generally a bad idea to take anything a prime minister (especially a Liberal) says at face value. Based on things I've read about events written after documents were declassified they're good to their word, but often pretty calculating behind the scenes.  As for social media and the alt right, it's very much a concern among those in the ""centre"" and the left. Preventing too much American influence is why things like Canadian Content rules exist, and I think you'll see a pretty strong push to limit the influence of American social media and tech companies after the next election.  As for the ""dictator"" comment I think you'll find that the PM has a lot more restraints on their power than might be evident to someone looking in from outside. They also haven't been tested and eroded in the way that presidents have been doing for decades.  You need to be decently read to understand what a lot of those restraints are, but most Canadians can ""feel"" them pretty deep down. See the generally hostile reaction to the idea of Carney governing for long without holding an election, or the anger proroguing parliament caused.  BTW: We very much learn from you. There's a good chance that your average Canadian knows just as much about American politics and history as Canada's, possibly more.

"That’s not what I said but ok lol after 08, republicans were in the worst position in a long time.

"Then answer the question: what ballot is it that he ""isn't on"" that Republicans lose? He can't be on every congressional, senate, and gubernatorial ballot in the country. I'm not sure if you're confused by what ""on the ballot"" means or what.   In 2018 the Republicans lost seats in the house, in 2022 they gained seats.   In 2018 the Republicans gained seats in the Senate, in 2022 they lost seats.   Like every midterm over all of time, it goes back and forth.

You might be slamming your head too hard cuz ever since he's become a political figure he's been on the ballot. He became president and the next 2 terms he ran for it again. I'm not a Trump supporter but your argument isn't making any sense,CornJulio420,2025-03-22T01:20:56,-1

I did answer the question you just can't figure it out don't you notice how everyone is voting my comments because everyone else is figured it out. Let me explain it to you again because I've said it 3 times already when he is not on the ballot when Trump is not a candidate running in an election Republican  Under perform expectations and the democrats over perform expectations. This has consistently occurred since Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016 I don't know how much more clear and concrete I can be than that,Impossible_Host2420,2025-03-20T15:31:50,6
What? lol no way dude. In 01 the republicans have the house and only the senate with a VP tie break lol in 08 the democrats had it all. You are delusional,wsu_savage,2025-03-20T14:10:37,0
"Well now that you've added the word ""expectations"" it's a little more clear what you're trying to say.    But to your original comment: you believe ""the GOP gets crushed"" means winning by less than what people expect?    They've won/gained seats in 2 of the 4 house/senate midterm elections.l since Trump came along. You can say they didn't perform to what was expected, sure, but gaining seats is not ""getting crushed"" by any stretch of the imagination, it's still literally winning that midterm election.    Historically, the first midterm after a president takes office goes the other way in the house....so exactly what's happened the last two elections. And the two before that - Republicans gained seats in the house the midterm after both of Obama's elections (to the tune of 63 seats the first time). This is a totally normal outcome and has nothing to do with Trump specifically. Look up historical midterm results - they outcome is pretty much always in favor of the opposite of the current president's party (with a few rare senate or house exceptions), because people prefer to not consolidate the power across all 3 branches.   Like again it's fine to say they've underperformed against polling but saying democrats have ""dominated"" midterms and that the ""GOP gets crushed"" when it's literally 1 to 1 in both the Senate and House the last two is pretty over the top, not particularly accurate and ignorant to historical outcomes.",jean-claude_trans-am,2025-03-20T15:49:15,3
