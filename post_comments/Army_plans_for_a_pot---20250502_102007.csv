">it would likely cost tens of millions of dollars to put on a parade of that size. Costs would include the movement of military vehicles, equipment, aircraft and troops from across the country to Washington and the need to feed and house thousands of service members.  I am shocked that DOGE is tolerating this kind of extravagance.",I405CA,2025-05-02T10:24:22,36

"What you just quoted is why I seriously doubt this will happen. He tried during his first term and it got shut down for those exact reasons.   If you've ever been to D.C. or are familiar with any of the bases surrounding it, you'd know the infrastructure just doesn't exist, and it is one of the most densely populated places in the country. The dollar cost is one issue, but the physical possibility of it is a real question also. For example, if you wanted to have a few tanks roll down Pennsylvania Ave, it wouldn't just be a few tanks needed. There is a whole maintenance, recovery and fueler section that would have to come with it and be staged nearby somewhere. Then there are the accommodations for the people operating all of that equipment etc. etc.",Bruce-7891,2025-05-02T10:33:17,13

"That's a bad plan. You need to keep the protest separate from the army so nobody can say people are protesting the army or not supporting troops. A better plan would be to make a bigger demonstration EVERYWHERE else, and make a point of supporting the troops.

"I actually doubt it, too.  If I was a senior officer involved in the decision making, I would order some kind of memo or report that outlines all of the logistical problems, then use that to kill this off.  Trump is a wannabe dictator.  His friend Putin has a military parade, so he wants one, too.  I hope that the Ukrainians drop a bunch of drones on the Moscow parade staging areas so that they can kill some troops without hurting civilians.  That will take the fun out of it.",I405CA,2025-05-02T10:37:14,8

"There‚Äôs such an easy solution here too. Make it an aerial parade. Have fly bys of helicopters, jets, and c-7s or whatever. Still ludicrously expensive and shouldn‚Äôt happen. it‚Äôd resolve a lot of the logistical issues and actually showcase what is used more in the battle field.
