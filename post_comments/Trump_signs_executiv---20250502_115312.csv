I was surprised that this hadn't happened already.  In fact in another post in this subreddit from yesterday I expressed surprise that NPR was even still around under Trump.,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T12:27:26,3

The CPB sued the Trump Administration on April 28th after Trump's attempt to fire CPB board of directors members. This is clearly his vindictive response to that.,krozarEQ,2025-05-02T12:46:22,3
"NPR gets most of its funding from other sources. Last I looked NPR got less than 10% from the fed. So even if CPB was eliminated entirely NPR would have 90% of its funding taken care of. I would imagine they'd just run their phone-a-thon a week or two longer and to shore themselves up.   As I understand it, correct me if this is my misunderstanding, but most of what CPB does is fund smaller radio stations in rural areas that would otherwise not be able to function. I don't know what the actual impact of this would be but it seems like the areas it would hurt the most are rural republican areas.",mmccxi,2025-05-02T12:37:15,2

That's just the direct funding. Trump is fond of using cancellation of 501c3 status as one of his weapons and right now NPR still considered 501c3 eligible,Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T12:40:55,1
The other part that doesn't get mentioned as often is that CPB gives grants to a number of public music stations around the country. They don't air any news or commentary. Those stations will likely go away.,ossyoos,2025-05-02T13:09:09,1
"Is it legal to just ""cancel"" it? You either qualify or you don't. But I am not a tax lawyer so I have no idea. It doesn't seem like it would just be up to opinion however, laws don't typically work that way. But what do i know.",mmccxi,2025-05-02T12:47:29,1
"""Is it legal"" is a phrase you never hear uttered in the White House.    The IRS and the ""Justice"" Department report to Trump and he's already in the process of using the IRS against Harvard and Act Blue.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-05-02T13:19:56,2
