"Plan?  You mean like ""let's employ competent writers and directors who don't resort to tired old tropes at every turn, quit studio interference altogether and let's remind all the 'stars' on set that their job is to act a role instead of acting out or trying to dictate or make demands, considering how much they are being paid. Do they even need to be paid that much? Also, how about we skip milking every franchise with lousy big budget sequels and reboots that nobody asked for while blatantly raping the source material and making everything pg13 in a desperate attempt to get the widest audience possible. And maybe focus on the story for a change, maybe the special effects don't have to be in the focus all the time""?  You mean something like that?  Oh, tax incentives. Ok.",AlleKeskitason,2025-05-06T14:39:47,2

"As an industry that makes movies and TV shows—in trade parlance: services, not products—Hollywood may have thought it was safe from President Donald Trump’s [tariffs](https://www.wired.com/tag/tariffs/). While the stock market took major dips over the last month, streaming players like [Netflix](https://www.wired.com/tag/netflix/) seemed like [a good bet](https://qz.com/netflix-stock-william-blair-first-quarter-earnings-1851777106).  On Sunday, that changed. Trump took to Truth Social to announce that the US movie industry was “DYING” and he wanted to bring it back using his favorite lever: tariffs. Specifically, a 100 percent tariff on movies coming to the US that were “produced in Foreign Lands.”  By Monday, White House spokesman Kush Desai was already pumping the brakes on the statement, [telling The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/white-house-clarifies-trump-movie-tariff-1236207216/) “no final decisions” had been made on the tariffs. That didn’t stop the industry from spiraling. Shares in Netflix, Disney, and other media properties [started to slip](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/us-media-stocks-slide-trump-movie-tariffs-netflix-amazon), but the real uncertainty laid in a much different question: [How the hell do you tariff movies](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/what-does-trumps-insane-100-tariff-on-foreign-movies-even-mean)?  Tariffs, as Trump deploys them, are meant to make importing so financially unappealing that companies make their products in the US. Movies, however, aren’t cars or iPhones. They don’t come over on ships and get taxed at the port. Would the tariffs apply to foreign films acquired by US distributors? If a US studio makes a film but shoots a handful of scenes overseas, does that count? Would TV shows be included? Would new movies shot abroad, like the forthcoming Mission: Impossible—The Final Reckoning, find themselves getting a hefty bill if the tariffs went into effect down the line? Answers [have not been forthcoming](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/can-trumps-movie-tariff-actually-work-1236207053/).

Why are you blaming the writers? The people putting up the money don't want to pay the good writers.    Here is the situation. Pitch guy A comes up to you and asks for 1/3 of your life savings to make a movie about meatballs falling from the sky.    He tells you if the movie is good you can quadruple your money. But if it is bad you loose all your money.    Guy B comes up to you asking for the same money and says we are making into the spider verse 3. He says I will quadruple your money if the movie does well but if it doesn't make anything at all you loose it all.    Who are you going to choose guy A or B?   Then 4 years later guy B comes back to you talking about into the spider verse 4.    Do you see what I'm saying?    ,CommissionVirtual763,2025-05-06T16:25:54,1
"Well, maybe that came out a bit wrong. Of course I'm not blaming all writers, I know  there are very good writers in Hollywood that are mostly unknown, I know that studios and snowflake stars keep raping the possibly good scripts and then we get masterpieces like Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd.  Of course I understand the choice of making a sequel, but that doesn't mean they have to take the crappy and tropy script that some doofus wrote. It's not like you have to make it either next week or never and don't have a choice of honing it.",AlleKeskitason,2025-05-06T21:57:34,1
"That movie is old as shit, at this point it's so old news you might as well be talking about a 70's movie or something.  They actually made a damn good Dredd movie but no one went and saw it so we never got a sequel.",Bircka,2025-05-07T01:17:30,1
"Yes, I know it's old, but you get the point. It's not like things have drastically changed.  And yes, I saw the Dredd movie, it was good. Good things tend to happen when someone actually competent decides to be stubborn enough to do things properly.  But Hollywood's main problem in my opinion is still the fact that they pour shitload of money into a wave of pure overbudgeted, safe, calculated garbage. That gives us artistic masterpieces like G20 and then they wonder why no one cares.",AlleKeskitason,2025-05-07T01:57:22,1
