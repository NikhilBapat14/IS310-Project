"I spent 8 years mostly on a submarine in the mid 1980's while the Cold War was still in full swing. Google USS Parche (SSN-683). They gave me shiny things to pin on my uniform.  This parade nonsense is something designed to appease the ego of one person who doesn't deserve respect from any military service member except for the quirk that the American people, for reasons I still cannot fathom, elected him to be Commander-In-Chief.  When DJT made his infamous remarks about Senator John McCain's Vietnam service record in 2015, I arrived at two rapid conclusions. First, this guy is a real serious asshole. Second, with that attitude, he's going to be a loser in politics. I was spot on with one prediction and missed the mark on the other. My bad.

"The only countries that do military parades are insecure authoritarian nations. And the purpose is to put on a public display of might, to make their population feel better aboutQ# itself in the face of their obvious weakness. North Korea does it on Dear Leader's birthday both to celebrate his birthday and to show the population how mighty and strong they are. Same goes for Russia. Putin knows damn well that Russia has only a fraction of the military strength of the US, so they put on these performative displays to show the Russian people their strength despite what everyone knows. It's an obvious indicator of national insecurity.  There's a reason why we've never done these types of parades; we have the strongest military in the world and don't need to advertise our strength in such a petty way. And we are a nation of laws, and democratic deliberation, not a militaristic nation that legislate through domestic force. Trump wants a self-aggrandizing military parade that misuses our military to celebrate him. Like those other nations, it's a reflection of his insecurity, and an expression of his personal need show everyone how big and strong he is. Such a spectacle will be a national disgrace, and will only make the rest of the world see him as weak.",Open_Mortgage_4645,2025-05-03T17:37:06,5

"Also, and thank you ""Sarah"" as I'm ""borrowing""  your comment:   The Trump administration has significantly undermined support systems for U.S. veterans.   1. **Employment**: A federal hiring freeze and budget cuts to job training programs made it harder for veterans to find and maintain employment. 2. **Health Care**: Proposed repeals of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid cuts would strip health coverage from hundreds of thousands of veterans, particularly those with low income or disabilities. 3. **Disability Support**: Plans to cut Social Security Disability Insurance and eliminate Individual Unemployability benefits would severely impact disabled and older veterans. 4. **Food Assistance**: Massive cuts to SNAP (food stamps) could deprive up to half a million veterans of critical nutrition support each year. 5. **Housing**: Reductions in rental assistance, public housing funds, and homelessness prevention programs would likely worsen veteran homelessness and housing insecurity.",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-05-03T16:00:20,2

"If you know, you know what to call it.  Fascist regimes frequently utilized military parades for propaganda and to demonstrate the power and discipline of the state. These parades often featured large-scale formations, emphasizing military strength and the fascist ideology. The use of military parades was a key tactic in consolidating power and projecting an image of strength and order.    Propaganda and Power Projection: Fascist leaders like Mussolini and Hitler used military parades as a powerful visual tool to demonstrate their strength and instill fear in both domestic and international audiences.    Militaristic Ideology: Fascist regimes often glorified military strength and often promoted a militaristic outlook, seeing it as a way to expand national power and prestige.    Social Discipline: Parades were also a way to enforce social discipline and obedience. By showcasing the power of the military and the strict order of the marches, fascist regimes aimed to create an atmosphere of fear and conformity.",ShogsKrs,2025-05-03T16:36:34,2

Hell, Grover Cleveland got married while he was in office. The ceremony was held in the Blue Room of the White House, but the ceremony itself and the reception afterwards were all private. There was lots of public interest and the newspapers covered it, but if there was any public celebration it was people just looking for an excuse to party and putting things together on their own, not something the government was hosting.  This sort of thing is LITERALLY unheard of. We have parades for major holidays and big events, but June 14 is not one of them. That's not even a federal holiday. They may have the excuse of the Continental Army being founded that day, but it's a nothing day otherwise. It's an excuse to have a parade on Trump's birthday because dictators do like to have state celebrations on their birthdays.  I mean, I could see blowing out all the stops and having major parades and celebrations for the 250th 4th of July... But that's not until 2026.

"This is a misinformed comment  The Army did not plan for a parade in its initial celebration planning and it is not normal for military parades to take place that involve heavy military equipment.  Have you honestly ever seen a tank roll down the street in an American parade?  Not to mention the thousands of active duty troops being transported/used for the event being described. We might have smaller displays of cadets, trainees or veterans participating in regional parades but not at this scale.  Edit: to add acknowledgement of the gulf war victory parade that took place in 1991, but case in point - not a normal or expected event because it's the Army's birthday, or that our Army is large.    The current parade plans as discussed in this thread were not even a part of the planning for the upcoming celebration until recently:  ""The Army’s early festival plans did not include a parade, but officials confirmed last month that the Army had started discussions about adding one."" - Armytimes  And the Army has not even verified that the parade will even happen yet:  ""There has been no formal approval yet. Changes to the plans have been made in recent weeks and more are likely."" - Armytimes   However, it IS true that Trump has pushed for a parade for a long time (and was denied it during his first term) and now again there are considerations of adding in a parade in the recent months? Hmmm....  ""Trump in his first term proposed having a grand military parade in the U.S. after watching one in France on Bastille Day in 2017. Trump said after watching the two-hour procession along the famed Champs-Élysées that he wanted a grander one in Washington on Pennsylvania Avenue.

"Actually, there is. And I might get downvoted all to hell for this because it contradicts the doomer echo chamber, but I did my research before typing this up. First, let it be known **I didn't vote for the motherfucker any of the three elections he ran in.** I may hate myself but I don't hate myself THAT much.            The US Army was officially established on June 14th, 1775 by order of the Second Continental Congress. June 14th, 2025 marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of US Army, an institution older than the United States itself. The 250th anniversary is a major milestone for any organization, especially the oldest branch of the US military, and **planning for this parade began several years ago.** Before anyone could have possibly known who would be in office this year. It just so happens that Trump was also born on June 14th. June 14th has been recognized every year as the birthday of the Army since its inception. It's not like they moved the celebration to coincide with Mango Unchained's birthday; the Army's birthday was ALWAYS June 14th, *it was their birthday first*. It's an incredibly unfortunate coincidence, but it is a coincidence nonetheless.        Considering everything happening right now, I understand that the optics for this really suck, but for once, the curtains are just blue.

"Branch-specific parades and displays of force are normal, every branch does this fairly regularly, although maybe not to this scale, at least every time.   While it is true that Trump has requested and ""demanded"" in the Trumpian sense a parade in his honor, this is not the case. Now, you could have leaned into the fact that Hegseth is SecDef and is Trump's lap dog, so if Trump wants a massive celebration/show of force he has an easy path to get it. Furthermore, the 250th birthday of the US Army is kind of a big deal and military parades have, in fact, featured heavy equipment including armor and very expensive war planes. Ask me how I know. (Hint: been to several over the course of my career).  I've even been to military parades/displays where they fire artillery, so while this certainly isn't the norm, it's not unheard of. The scale is massive, 6,000-7,000 troops is a lot, but that's also not just ground forces, some of those will include service crew for armor, transports, IT, and aircraft including the pilots and aircrew. Look, I'm not trying to give cover for Trump and his bullshit, but the media and people on this sub are not informed nor have many been in the military before to know the logistics and traditional celebrations. Does Trump/Hegseth have their thumbs on the scale? Probably, I'd wager money they do. Does that mean this is all for Trump's birthday? Absolutely not, but you can bet your ass command is likely viewing this as a massive pain in the ass mixed with a way to boost morale and possibly recruitment, and getting clearance to spend big bucks and put your name on it (hello promotion packet bragging) is going to go down relatively smoothly with the folks running the show. If it just so happens to appease the Commander-in-Chief, then great. If he wants to claim it's all for him, fine, let him, not worth the fight. In a climate where the POTUS is petty and willing to destroy your career on a whim of narcissism, appeasing him with a large military display/parade might be worth it to ensure you and friends of yours remain ""gray men"" and keep their careers.   I just think we're getting wrapped in to this nothingburger when we could focus on more substantial issues like the Yemen refugee/migrant camp bombing and the current Constitutional Crisis at-hand with renditions to El Salvador and ignoring the SCOTUS. Not to mention the economic devastation about to unleash on everyday Americans. Trump is likely doing this as he has done for ages to spark conflict and debate to provide cover and distraction to more heinous scandals that are hard to distance from. Same thing with the AI image of him as the Pope. It's all kayfabe theater to Trump, and likely his staff. They're a bunch of wannabe losers puffing their chest and hoping the perfume of grand displays or vain controversy will keep the stench of bullshit, corruption and incompetence from coming through.",Cuntmasterflex9000,2025-05-04T15:06:11,1

"#1. Did Trump praise China for the Tiananmen Square Massacre?  	•	**Partially true, with context.**   In a 1990 Playboy interview, Trump said:  “When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it. Then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength. Our country is right now perceived as weak.”  This comment clearly reflects a **focus on strength**, not explicitly approving of the violence, but **focusing admiringly on the authoritarian show of power.**  **Verdict:** He did not outright “praise” the massacre, but he did **highlight the government’s “strength”** in suppressing dissent in a way that many critics interpreted as disturbing or authoritarian-leaning admiration.  ⸻  #2. Was this referenced in a presidential debate?  	•	**Yes.**  During a **2016 Republican primary debate**, moderator Maria Bartiromo asked Trump about his views, citing the 1990 Playboy interview. Trump responded:  “That doesn’t mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that was a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn’t mean at all I was endorsing it.”  So the **interview was referenced**, and Trump attempted to **distance himself** from endorsing the massacre while maintaining that it demonstrated “strength.”  **Verdict:** True. It came up in a debate and was tied to the Playboy interview.  ⸻  #3. “Bragging about how cool he thought it was since it happened”  	•	**Exaggerated.**  There is **no consistent record of Trump “bragging” about the massacre being “cool”.** The Playboy quote is the main and most well-known source of this line of discussion. Calling it “bragging about how cool it was” is a **colorful exaggeration**, not a literal record of Trump’s repeated statements.  **Verdict: False/exaggerated** — overstated for rhetorical effect.  ⸻  #4. “Titty mag” (i.e., Playboy interview)  	•	**Technically true but framed provocatively.**  Playboy is indeed a magazine with adult content and centerfolds, though it also has long published interviews with public figures. The Trump interview appeared in the **March 1990 issue.**  **Verdict:** True, if cheekily stated.",sortsbycon1roversial,2025-05-03T14:07:03,7

This is not that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a tank in a US parade in my life. Maybe in some of the post WWII ticker tape parades that happened immediately after the war was over?

"We have never, to my knowledge, celebrated an active President's birthday with such a display.  Certainly, past Presidents get some acknowledgement. George Washington and Abraham Lincoln get [President's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents%27_Day) since both were born in February. It's also sort of a pseudo ""every past President"" holiday too. I wouldn't even care if Trump coped that into his own ""President's Day"" nonsense since it is literally called *President's Day* so whatever. I'd ignore him of course, but it's a fair holiday. Especially since it's our only real holiday until Memorial Day at the end of May. We get an MLK Jr day in January and a lot of time for thanksgiving and Christmas, but after that it's sparse for a bit. And the US only really does like ~10 major holidays anyway.  So yeah, this is quite unusual. The time for a major parade like this involving the army would be either Memorial Day, the Fourth of July or Veteran's Day. Like someone else said in this comments, we're coming up on America's 250th birthday. THAT'S the time to go all out and spend $100M on a massive parade. Because MERICA FUCK YEAH 250 YEARS WOOO and all.  Even then, we usually don't do such major military parades. We do floats and stuff. Think some truck towing a trailer that some school kids decorated. That's shit like the Macy Days Thanksgiving parade, and quite common for the 4th of July with lots of patriotic displays. Sometimes we do that for other holidays too, like Halloween sometimes gets some spooky parades. And often there's a Christmas parade in many towns with Santa themed stuff. We do not generally get the military involved for tanks and shit. If anything, it's more common that we do military plane flyovers. That's wicked common for opening day at a Ball game, like Fenway Park for the Red Sox gets that every year. NASCAR (auto racing) also will often request a fly over and the Air Force will use those requests to get training done (flight hours so they're combat ready) so it's not a big deal and sort of efficient too.",Master_Dogs,2025-05-03T12:56:02,3

Valid and fair response. I appreciate the deeper dive/explanation.  I'll admit that displays of pride across the branches is not uncommon but the scale and occasion it's for is unusual  (a Smithsonian article from another comment I thought sheds some interesting and additional light on the topic: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-military-parades-us-have-changed-180968102/).  I can only speak from my own experience in the service and I definitely don't discredit your own - I did have pause regarding what seemed like a diffusion of responsibility of sorts towards the part of Trump's ego and its part to play in it all in comparison to what the Army had initially planned and especially since not everyone has first pov understanding of the military.  Anyway - you're right that it's not for his birthday and I think we both agree on it's being a colossal pain in the ass and also the recognized opportunity gained from the occasion.   Side note: I also was never opposed to your points regarding Hegseth or Trump's angling of inflated self-importance regarding the event which is why I didn't touch upon them in my reply  That all said - you hit it on the head in the end with your point regarding the distractions and flair when more serious issues are at hand.

And the great irony is that any rebel elements don’t need to win, per se. Merely forcing the regime to have to explicitly stop them could potentially cause such a crisis of faith in the myth of American Exceptionalism, that it triggers unforeseen, unpredictable reactions and counter-reactions that cause the regime’s plans to spin out of control. (For example, how will markets react to the never-before-seen spectre of the US not only attacking an ally but also having to put down internal resistance?

"It has definitely happened.   It's also not a good fit to compare the military of Germany in 1933 to the US military in 2025. OF COURSE the military didn't stop Hitler in 1933. It was the military he was essentially representing. Hitler became popular because Germany and its army were humiliated by WW1. Hitler's original platform was to restore Germany's standing and reputation as a military powerhouse. Members of the army and politicians were the ones who felt that humiliation most deeply and clung to Hitler's message.   But 2025 US military is the exact opposite. It is renowned as the strongest, most advanced in the world. It's next closest rival has fallen flat on its face. The investments and innovations the US military have made aren't intended to win a war. They are to ensure one never happens because the outcome is inevitable. Trump threatens everything the US military cares about: Its reputation, its stability, its budget, it's neutrality, and its safety.    The US military is also waaaaayyyy bigger than the German army, spread across the world, and divided into independent forces. It's 3M people and something like 500 generals. When Hitler came to power, the Germany military was treaty-bound to stay under 100k men, with something like 50 generals. So Hitler had a force of 100k humiliated men, kept on leash by the rest of Europe, who were more than ready to break that leash. Trump's forces are 5 sleeping giants that have no desire to wake up. He can replace some of the top brass with people who will obey him, but it barely makes a dent in the sea of career servicemen who knows what their job is and what's at stake.",MommyLovesPot8toes,2025-05-03T23:46:34,1
