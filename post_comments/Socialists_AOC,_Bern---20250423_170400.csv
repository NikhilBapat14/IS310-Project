"Look, I get it...hypocrisy is annoying. But, I'm exhausted with stuff like this.  I see these posts and I see the comments time after time, over and over again. The end result? Nothing, nada, zilch.  Wasting time on ""GOTCHA!"" moments with Dems is an exercise in futility, they don't care..their core constituents don't care, we collectively need to spend energy elsewhere.",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-23T18:33:07,185

"Communism makes different promises to different classes.  To the people, it promises that they'll get so much free money they won't have to work.  To the leadership, it promises them total control over the nation's wealth.  It only ever keeps one.",Ghosttwo,2025-04-23T20:22:40,14

Disagree entirely. The entire reason why I left the democrat party is because of the hypocrisy that many of you all here illuminated to me.  I think it's incredibly important to call out any level of hypocrisy.,ObjectiveJackfruit35,2025-04-23T23:41:13,20

"Yes, you're absolutely right. It's not the cost of living, the broken American dream for Gen Z, a complete potato exposed as the candidate or Cackling Kamala as the replacement that pushed voters to vote Republican. It's the finger pointing and table thumping on reddit that did it. Keep up the good fight!",Sangmund_Froid,2025-04-23T20:50:33,20
"I think that has more to do with how recently the comment was posted. Idk if they still do it this way, but comments used to have their score hidden for a period of time before you could see how many upvotes or downvotes it has.
