Voters need to remember its not just Trump he gets away with his crap because Republican representatives enable him.,sedatedlife,2025-04-30T20:13:14,14

"Senate Republicans, pausing to wipe their mouths after fellating Trump, said they are totally fine with that orange imbecile collapsing the economy. Also, that everything is Biden's fault. MAGAts, light-headed from sniffing Trump's soiled diapers, bobbled their empty heads in agreement.",Appropriate-Soft-188,2025-04-30T19:36:58,10
Why have a senate when they are what Trump wipes his ass with ? The really funny part is - DO THEY REALLY think that they aren’t in line for total removal ?? I mean Trump is not beholden to them !,FunConfection2872,2025-04-30T19:23:31,20

Republicans are proving time after time that they do not need 60 votes to pass their agenda...and damn the parliamentarian...,Agnos,2025-04-30T20:14:16,2
This title. Bang this drum and make the folks who voted against answer for why? Run those ads in their home states.,77Robbs,2025-04-30T21:19:41,2

And they voted . And Trump can continue his tariff playground .  You are right paywall is the way to go . Eventually I’ll just Ignore it because I won’t pay for that .,FunConfection2872,2025-04-30T19:26:25,5
They won't be removed. They'll be a showpiece and illusion of representation like the Senate of the Galactic Empire.,Possible_Proposal447,2025-04-30T19:36:38,9
"They’ve already enriched themselves, so no, they don’t care if they are removed. The two party facade is going to shambles quicker than they hoped it would and there is no more denying the fact that neither party gives a flying fuck about ANY OF US. The Dem not showing up to vote is by design. Keep the status quo going by all means. Maybe more libs, who laughably call themselves leftists, will wake tf up now and stop hoping that the Democratic Party will save them. Both parties solely work for their corporate overlords. Point. Blank. Period. All we have is each other at this point. It’s beyond time for the brainwashed libs and conservatives to deprogram themselves of hating each other when we should be hating our do-nothing politicians and the billionaires who tell them what to do. All of the intentional pinning against each other the GOP and the Dems have sowed upon us to keep us too busy hating each other to distract us and keep us from hating them, The TRUE villains. This needs to stop NOW. All of us have way more in common than y’all would like to think we do. There are more of us than there are them. It’s time to do something about this because neither party is going to save us. They are working together to keep us down. Wake the fuck up people.",caprikaironic,2025-04-30T20:18:09,9
> Republicans now own this contracting economy.  They'll blame Trump...question is will the democrats let them get away with it as usual.,Agnos,2025-04-30T20:42:00,3
