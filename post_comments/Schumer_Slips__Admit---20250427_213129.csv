"Sorry, I read the article and honestly didn't see how it supported that headline.  He said that Democrats are looking for ways to stop Trump's actions. I'm not shocked by this.  ""Justice"" didn't come up. It wasn't like a verbal slip or something. The story seems to be that Schumer has said they're looking for ways to stop Trump. Dog bites man.",JackNoir1115,2025-04-28T06:05:40,24

"Once upon a time, the man could straightface his way through lies that would melt an average person from corrosive fumes.  If he has lost his talent, then I can see why the party is putting him out to pasture.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-04-27T22:24:50,2

"Obama was exactly what we said he was, and led to exactly what we said he would.   The media provided 100% cover.",TedriccoJones,2025-04-28T06:00:23,11
That's too bad. It would keep him from spouting more stupidity.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T07:23:05,4
"Absolutely. But it was the same thing, as soon as he was elected someone made the comment that the goal of the Republicans was to make him a one term president by blocking everything he did. Which they totally failed at.",JustinCayce,2025-04-28T06:32:59,3
Attempting to keep a president from being reelected is a far cry from threatening him with impeachment.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T07:42:23,4
