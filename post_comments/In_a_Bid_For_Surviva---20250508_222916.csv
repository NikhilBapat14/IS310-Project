"As per [original article](https://www.businessinsider.com/businesses-are-labeling-tariff-costs-on-receipts-bid-for-survival-2025-5) 📰:  - Businesses, large and small, are hoping to retain consumer trust by showing how much tariffs increase prices.  - Business experts say consumer awareness of tariffs could spell trouble for Trump’s polling rates.  When Jared Fisher found out his major supplier of electric bikes was raising its prices by 10%, he had a choice to make: eat the cost or pass it along to his customers.  “If you cut 10% into a bicycle margin, then you might as well get ready to have your exit strategy for your business because you’re not going to be able to operate,” Fisher, who owns several bike shops in Nevada and Utah, told Business Insider. “There’s no way.”  Instead, Fisher decided to be transparent with his customers about why prices were rising on some of his products. He added a new line item directly to the price tags on bikes hanging in his shops. On one bike he sells for $7,999, the price tag now shows an additional $300 “Government Tariff Charge.”  “I have no problem labeling where this tax is coming from on my products,” he said. “People need to know that so I have a fighting chance on my end.”  On April 2, President Donald Trump imposed a 10% baseline tariff on all imports into the US, as well as additional tariffs on dozens of trading partners. Though some of the higher tariffs — with the exception of those on China and some on Mexico and Canada — are on pause, the sweeping 10% tariffs are still in place. And prices are starting to go up.  From brick-and-mortar retailers to online small businesses, many have told Business Insider that the tariffs are forcing them to pass the cost to consumers, and it’s not because they want to.  To make matters worse for smaller operations, they do not have the same bargaining power with suppliers or cash flow as larger retailers like Walmart. Suppliers in some manufacturing hubs like China are also seeing ever-shrinking margins to help absorb the tariff shock.  “Small businesses are basically in danger of going out of business because of these high tariffs,” Peter Cohan, associate professor of management at Babson College and a venture capitalist, told BI, “And they’re trying to preserve the trust of their customers by being very transparent about why they’re raising the prices.”  “Maybe they’re going to lose customers because of the higher rates, but at least being transparent will help reduce the damage,” Cohan added.  Larger businesses may also have considered such transparency measures. After reports that Amazon is going to start displaying how much tariffs are contributing to the price of goods on its platform, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the idea a “hostile and political act.” The e-commerce giant denied that it planned to display the cost of tariffs, saying its low-price section, Haul, had considered it for some items but then jettisoned the idea.  Chinese fast-fashion giants Shein and Temu — most affected by the 145% tariffs on China and the canceled de minimus exemptions — posted identical customer notices on their websites, saying that that there will be “price adjustments” because their “operating expenses have gone up” under “recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs.”  At the end of April, Temu started adding “import charges” at checkout, which can double the price of the item. By May, Temu’s main website appeared to have blocked US customers from seeing products shipped from China, and the site is filled with products marked “local” to signify they are at a warehouse in the US.  “Displaying tariff costs directly on product pages can offer strategic advantages for platforms like Temu and Shein,” Nasim Mousavi, assistant professor at Georgia State University Robinson College of Business, told BI. “By itemizing tariffs, these platforms frame price increases as the result of external policy rather than their own pricing decisions.”  “This transparency can enhance customer trust, reinforce a value-oriented brand image, and foster the perception that the platform is advocating on behalf of the consumer,” Mousavi added.  According to a survey of 1,850 US adult citizens conducted between May 2 and 5 by the Economist and YouGov, 75% of those surveyed think that Trump’s tariffs will increase their prices, and 61% would like businesses to display how much of a purchase price goes toward paying tariffs.  “The obvious reason why the White House wouldn’t want businesses to show tariff costs is because it makes it obvious how much their policy is costing consumers,” said Cohan. “It’s going to drive down the poll ratings because consumers will be extremely aware of how much more they’re paying and who’s causing them to pay it.”",T_Shurt,2025-05-08T22:30:43,39

"Because if retailers are not itemizing their tariffs, then non-tariffed retailers can raise their prices to gouge consumers under the guise of tariffs.",FrostyMatters,2025-05-09T07:09:18,6
"So, it depends on which retailer you are. I'm referring largely to _large_, nearly monopolistic retailers (Amazon, Walmart, grocery stores, etc).  Prices are going to go _up_ with tariffs, but the amount those prices go up won't be by the amount of the tariff surcharge.  One reason is distributors and retailers will want to maintain their margin, so they'll raise the price a little more than the actual tariff cost. Another reason is there will be fewer goods but the same level of demand, so prices will naturally rise, but again, this price increases won't be the tariff surcharge itself, just supply and demand. Some of it will be the importer needing to raise prices due to having to finance significantly more things, and so the overall overhead for importers might go up.  Basically, there are *lots* of factors that are going to increase prices due to tariffs, and the tariff surcharge itself is only going to be one factor among many.  If the retailer lists the tariff surcharge, people are going to blame the retailer for price increases beyond the tariff list price. If the retailer *does not* list the tariff surcharge, there's ambiguity and the retailer can deflect questions by saying ""the tariffs are making things more expensive ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"".  The divide between ""major retailer"" and ""small to medium business"" here is very significant. Amazon, Walmart, etc aren't going to die due to tariffs. It will impact their finances for sure, but it's not an existential threat. The linked article is generally about small businesses, where the threat is much more existential. In that case, the thinking is less ""how can I raise my prices without too many customers blaming me"", but more ""how _little_ can I raise prices, and how can I demonstrate to customers I'm doing everything I can to keep prices down"".",noahcallaway-wa,2025-05-09T12:19:19,2
