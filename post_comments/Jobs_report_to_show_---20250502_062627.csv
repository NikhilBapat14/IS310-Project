"Do you believe the numbers will represent the real numbers or more BS from the tump administration?  “The white house today announced the jobs creation numbers for the month of March, 6 million new jobs were added while the weekly unemployment figures were at 4. We now employ more than 110% of the entire US population.”",ctguy54,2025-05-02T06:41:17,6

">""We have been ripped off by every country in the world practically. And friend and foe,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office last month. ""We're not doing that anymore.""  Trump and Republicans want a piece of that pie. They want to be the ones ripping people off. American voters can fend for themselves.

">the U.S. economy shrank over the first three months of 2025  I'd say right now is the point at which the US government stops releasing good data.  See Richard Quest's reaction to Trump advisers' tariff remarks   https://youtu.be/ajepCm-mYUE?t=79    Because what good numbers are we to expect in the next 6-12 months? How about 4 years from now?  China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.",tech57,2025-05-02T07:31:10,2
