It already has been killing innovation. It's worse than anyone even realizes.,Mark_Pollock,2025-05-06T14:28:55,42
"I keep posting this. My fiancé and I are leaving next year.  Personally, I am an engineer that came from Scotland via Canada and my sig other is a double doctor (PhD wrapping up this year), who works for a major hospital in a blue state (online) as well as a couple of other clinics (also online).  We have applied to Ireland and are actively wrapping things up here in the USA to head out.  The kicker to this is that HR where she works and asked about working internationally told her that 75% of the female doctors made such calls to them, and this was about 2 months ago. No idea what the number is now.  The thing is that people that are educated and necessary here in the USA have the means to leave and be welcome pretty much anywhere in the world.  Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Italy, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand, etc. They have all reached out and are setting up relocation incentives for educated people to leave the country. Especially in the Technology, Medical and Research fields.   When I say ""reached out"" I mean that contacts for those governments have given information to the graduating classes in various fields in this country.    There will be no next generation of engineers, doctors and scientists in America.  They are all going to be head hunted to make some other country great.  Smart countries are poaching the best out of the USA because of the turmoil and in a very short time the USA will be at the bottom for research, tech, etc.  But the powers that be want it that way. Cheaper labor = under educated masses.  Good luck being able to see a doctor face to face (yeah this means surgeries, etc.), in the very near future. It is already very time consuming to see doctors especially specialists.  It is amazing how bad its gotten in just a few months but we don't want to be on the rollercoaster wondering if I might get deported (US Citizen), or her rights get pulled away (female).",No-Cut-6501,2025-05-06T14:55:00,15

"Already doing so. Canada, several European countries  like Germany and even China, are stealing the top talents from the USA.  USA will be dead last, if it continues, because of its focus on the past, instead of looking ahead into the future.",gamefan5,2025-05-06T14:32:03,8

What was 1+1 again Mr. Trump? Trump: It's beautiful that's what it is.  Raising a country of idiots is perfect for this idiot president. ,arilupe,2025-05-06T14:32:01,2
"Man, I have a Canadian student from Toronto who is an incredibly hard working, high-achieving student-athlete. Whenever she visited home, she'd always bring me a bottle of Canadian maple syrup.   Now, she's questioning whether it's worth staying here to finish her degree. We could have kept her easily, if this bugshit crazy blight on the gene pool not been elected President and started picking fights with...of all the goddam places...CANADA.",Fluid_Anywhere_7015,2025-05-06T17:19:22,2

"Yeah I'm in higher education and it's bad. We've already had a few international students sent back. Few international students are interested in applying in the US, and many international students here are already making plans of transferring elsewhere. Many US citizens in higher education (including myself) are also making plans of moving elsewhere.",kobyscool,2025-05-06T15:00:53,5

And EU has set up 566 £ million (\~636$ million). I bet multiple countries will follow suit. Its a great investment to get scientists that have finished or almost finished their whole education,bjwindow2thesoul,2025-05-09T03:32:48,2

We were already seeing localized brain drain here in the United States. I myself am a statistic of that after fleeing Wyoming for Seattle after getting a computer science degree from the University of Wyoming.  That this would eventually extend beyond our borders is not a surprise.,jayfeather31,2025-05-06T14:58:31,7
"My view from afar is that the US is becoming an anti-intellectual book burner.  The average reading age in the US is around grade six-eight according to various studies.  Public education is so underfunded that fewer and fewer will enter higher education. Some red states are removing the requirement to pass in maths and English in order to graduate.  Is it any wonder that political discourse has deteriorated and Trump has risen?  The US was able to develop its scientific and broader intellectual stocks after WW2 and this propelled it to economic success. Many of these scientific and other contributors were migrants.  Losing its intellectual capacity through a brain drain will squander the gains that it made after WW2 and will have a severe economic and social impact which will be almost impossible to turn around.  Once lost to other nations these people will never return and the crumbling education system will be unable to replace them.  This, and all the rest of the chaos and destruction unleashed by Trump , brings to mind the fall of the Roman Empire.",iyamwhatiyam8000,2025-05-06T22:29:03,3
"This is also inadvertently going to drive costs up at universities. It was an open secret at my university, the foreign graduate students funded a huge chunk of the undergraduate program while providing cheap research and teaching assistants.",bpeck451,2025-05-06T19:37:25,4
