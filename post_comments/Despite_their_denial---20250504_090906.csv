"So you're saying all the redditors who've been choking down the CCP's tiny red pp are actually lying? I know China is losing that's obvious if you're paying attention, I just never thought that I'd see ppl simp for China of all countries",Zachjsrf,2025-05-04T11:20:48,171
"I‚Äôm in Spain right now, and Chinese stores here are lowering prices like crazy, trying to sell quickly. I think a lot of Chinese stores are going to close worldwide.Idk how president Trumps tariffs are affecting them in other countries as well but is happening.",Vincent019,2025-05-04T13:55:21,50
"This is all noise. Obviously, the NY Post will write a piece that makes the administration look good. That's the kind of newspaper they are. Other newspapers will report the opposite. There is nothing insightful or interesting in this piece. It simply takes the admin's word for granted, and brings up some non-sequiturs about what Chinese school children are being taught... as if that's relevant to geo-politics right now.",HaikuHaiku,2025-05-04T15:18:00,72
"But I thought ‚ÄúChina is invincible, they‚Äôre a dictatorship, they won‚Äôt ever blink or flinch. They‚Äôll weather this and be just fine.‚Äù",ITrCool,2025-05-04T10:22:47,35
 It was obvious that China would lose a trade war.  But their people must not know that.,mdws1977,2025-05-04T09:42:46,59

"I'm in the flashlight sub and they got pretty worked up over prices going up, resorting to hoarding....  Not many of them have a pressing need to get anything right this minute... And no one apparently wants to wait for the dust to settle, they just want to shout at clouds..   Meanwhile they're sitting on 39 flashlights as it isü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  And very very few buy anything US made",indefiniteretrieval,2025-05-04T12:06:02,22
"Ah yes, but you see: simping for anyone is better than ever even considering that Trump might be right about something. If Hitler were still in Germany they would probably support him over Trump. I mean, they already did it for genocidal terrorists, so why not?",Rush2201,2025-05-04T12:20:56,63
"Same. Never thought I'd see people picking China as the good guy in this. Someone needs to confront them now or there won't be a Taiwan, then Phillippines etc.",Merax75,2025-05-04T18:42:04,7
The US has been basically subsidizing China's economy for a couple decades.,xterraadam,2025-05-04T14:36:16,56

"I've said this before, and people rarely listen, but China is not nearly as strong as they pretend to be... in anything. If WW3 broke out and they had to commit the bulk of their army anywhere they would fall apart at home as their people revolted, \*especially\* if they started to lose any battles. They've had a democratic push that they've been forcefully suppressing in that country for years, and I don't think they have the forces to keep them down AND fight us on multiple fronts. If China were nearly as confident as they act they would have taken Taiwan years ago. They may still go for it, but it will be because they desperately need it, not simply because they want it.",Rush2201,2025-05-04T12:27:18,28

"You really need just one good flashlight, and a stash of batteries.  Also, unlike when I was growing up, everyone has a flashlight in their pocket.  I use the light on my Android far more often than my trusty Mag Lite which is close to 25 years old now (converted with a drop in LED bulb 18 years ago) and still going strong.",TedriccoJones,2025-05-04T20:30:58,2
