"The craziest thing about this lawsuit: they argued votes for Riggs should be thrown out, while votes for Trump on the SAME ballot should be valid.   Batshit crazy GOP",hyborians,2025-05-06T10:11:42,149
The icing on the cake here is that this decision came from a Trump appointed judge. Beautiful.,BlotchComics,2025-05-06T10:11:22,34
Great news glad to see the courts holding the line on the republican dirty deeds.,Anxious_Claim_5817,2025-05-06T12:00:39,12
Griffin is an embarrassment to the legal profession. He deserves to be disbarred for this nonsense.,TheBoosThree,2025-05-06T13:40:32,12
">Riggs celebrated the ruling in a statement posted to the social platform X, writing, “Today, we won.”  >“I’m proud to continue upholding the Constitution and the rule of law as North Carolina’s Supreme Court justice,” she added.  You can be sure that if Justice Riggs' is vindicated and her election victory is certified, she will absolutely...*positively*...continue to rule in an impartial manner that upholds the integrity and independence of the judiciary by ensuring that all decisions are fair and impartial and void of any appearance of impropriety.",subUrbanMire,2025-05-06T10:38:33,17
If they could just have 100 more months of fuckery there is no doubt that they can shape the outcome they want!,gabber2694,2025-05-06T15:29:15,2

This is but a mere District Judge. They have the same authority as a middle school hall monitor. So now the appeals start. And enforcement..?,williamgman,2025-05-06T10:22:14,-26
"They did the same in 2020! They said the election was rigged only for the president, all the congressmen who echoed Trump about the stolen election won on the exact same ballots they said were fraudulent against trump. It has never made sense but the media never questions them why their elections were legitimate, but the presidential election wasn't in 2020.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-05-06T10:15:27,46
"It’s almost like they realize that if there’s no law, they’re out of a job!",clover-the-clever,2025-05-06T17:54:08,6
"A Federal district court is a step above the state supreme court, it sheds light on that partisan ruling in the NC state supreme court. No indication yet that they will appeal.  They are required to abide by the ruling unless they appeal and get a temporary stay, you sound as if there are other options.  Time to give up this partisan effort to overturn an election.",Anxious_Claim_5817,2025-05-06T12:15:04,18
"You'd think that if Dems were going to rig an election to win the White House, they'd take Congress back as well.",dalgeek,2025-05-06T12:14:12,22
