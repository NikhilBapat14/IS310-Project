"Only time will tell how Carney did yesterday, and we'll know by the state of Canada's well-being,  not these ""shoot from the hip"" talking heads. I'm too far left to have voted for Mr.Carney, but one thing is for sure, Canada is hemorrhaging auto sector jobs and the US president threatens Canadian sovereignty on nearly a daily basis. If either of these things improve, then I'll concede he's doing a good job, but I'm not convinced thus far",gorillasuitriot,2025-05-07T14:56:44,-2
>I'm too far left to have voted for Mr.Carney  Iâ€™m somewhere to the left of Marx himself and I voted LPC because it seemed clear to me that Carney is the right person for the job at this point in our history.  But I understand your motivation and I applaud you for voting your principles and your conscience.  Best to you.,sharp11flat13,2025-05-08T05:49:18,1
