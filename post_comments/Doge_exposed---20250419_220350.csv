Terrorist attack from the inside. Putin is loving this.,LotsofSports,2025-04-20T11:28:40,17
"The link, for anyone interested: [https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/doge-breach-sparks-cybersecurity-crisis-as-russian-ip-tries-to-access-federal-labor-systems-senate-receives-urgent-complain/articleshow/120350816.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/doge-breach-sparks-cybersecurity-crisis-as-russian-ip-tries-to-access-federal-labor-systems-senate-receives-urgent-complain/articleshow/120350816.cms?from=mdr)  TL;DR: The NLRB site was \*nearly\* accessed using a newly-created account tied to a DOGE email address.  The IP tracing back to Russia could very well have been due to a VPN, so it's not confirmation of Russian (or foreign, for that matter) interference.  The attacker used the correct username and password, but access to the site was still blocked for unspecified reasons. DOGE has been hacking away at cybersecurity and auditing systems as they trapse through sensitive data on the citizenry, so it's both fortunate (and honestly, miraculous) that access was still blocked.  The NLRB site contains information such as union-organizing efforts, employee whistleblower identities, and legal strategies.",i_grad,2025-04-20T09:02:24,5
There are so many Russian assets in Trumpworld we may as well just assume Putin himself is in the situation room at all times.,The_B_Wolf,2025-04-20T18:51:17,4
