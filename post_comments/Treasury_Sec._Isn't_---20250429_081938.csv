"Really sucked because I wanted to buy and build a new computer. I definitely won't be able to afford one now and I'm definitely not paying double or triple my budget of 2k. Everyone loses because of this. I'll unfortunately have to cut my spending to entirely necessities, and maybe even less.  The sad thing is you know Trump will never ever admit he was wrong. Never in the history of Trump has he ever admitted being wrong. He'll drag the entire country down with him before he does that.",Weekly-Trash-272,2025-04-29T08:23:23,40

"I wouldn't buy anything perishable. The effects of this should be extremely minimal in the foods department. I'm not buying anything extra. The only thing I see becoming a real problem is people starting to panic over things not affected by the tariffs, then that panic turning into a real panic. The toilet paper shortage is something that only happened from panic. The inconvenience is going to be things like a microwave, a refrigerator, a television set etc. There is a domino effect that eventually will cascade into the average Americans daily life over the long term.",IndependentRegion104,2025-04-29T11:34:00,3

You forget Leon was fullbore Democrat before they started investigating him. You remember Hillary stealing primary from Bernie causing Trumps first term ? It's easy to place blame.

That's the funny part of this tariffs fiasco we all have to suffer through. The main use of a tariff is to make the imported goods cost more than the domestic goods so people buy the ones made local.   Using the iPhone example. There isn't a factory in the US that makes them. So there is no local good. So the tariff is just a tax to extract wealth from the population.   A tax rebate on labor would do more to being manufacturing back to the states than anything else. Assuming they aren't just using robots to build everything anyways.,jtmj121,2025-04-29T12:57:15,5
