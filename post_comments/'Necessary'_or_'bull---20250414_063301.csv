"If you are an American and you are pro-anything but American...then you don't belong in this country, please feel free to leave.

"They're friends in the same way Stalin was our friend during WW2 and the Taliban were our friends during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  Or to put it more bluntly, friends you can't show your back to aren't really your friends.",Shadeylark,2025-04-14T11:18:25,-3
