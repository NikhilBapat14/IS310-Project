"So many comments in here about the right wing media attacking certain candidates like they won’t do that regardless of who wins. They called Obama a socialist and they will call any Democrat who runs a socialist, communist, whatever. Stop thinking from a place of fear and start actually voting your values. Most thought trump could not win when he first ran in 2016 and here we are with being elected  for a second term.  This party is cooked. People in the comments saying “I don’t want to let the right wing dictate our nominee but…” and then proceed to do exactly that. They have you defeated and thinking on their terms in your own minds. It’s sad.  This party will continue to nominate corporate dems who will not actually change anything paving the way for the next trumpian figure to win by demonizing immigrants, minorities and whatever “other” they can think of. The Overton window continues to shift ever rightward because of these attitudes.",MoonManDolo,2025-03-19T10:25:50,300
"I don't want to establish who the leaders are right now, but Murphy is one of very few acting like a leader. I want the party to know that's the kind of leadership we want from them. He's the only one in the Senate under 70 I think looks like a leader (Tammy Duckworth is the only other I would consider, Schatz was there, but his vote with Schumer is an issue). The house has AOC, Crockett, and a few others and generally is in a better place than the Senate. Outside of congress, Pritzker, Walz, and Buttigieg have been standing out. Whitmer could be, but seems more concerned with state politics than national. That's the list of people I think of when I think of leaders in the party under 70.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-03-19T09:50:41,76
I think Murphy has a lot of charisma. But I thought this 10 years ago and he was never ambitious enough to want to run for president. He is happy being a senator from a small state. Probably doesn’t want all the headache. Maybe he may want senate leadership but I don’t see him going for presidency.,ChepaukPitch,2025-03-19T09:59:20,21
"I think Tim Walz is a real standard bearer for the kind of mainstream progressivism that appeals broadly in the country. He comes off as sincere and his positions are generally rooted in common sense and empathy so they’re difficult to dismiss as agenda driven.  AOC is obviously a voice people respond to but is limited in her national appeal as someone who represents a particularly progressive district. Her voice is necessary and powerful but might not appeal to a wide enough base to bring people into the fold.  As another commenter noted, there also needs to be voices outside the establishment. A huge part of Trump’s appeal is the perception that he is unencumbered by the political establishment. Someone like Mark Cuban comes to mind as a left-leaning figure who is what Trump claims to be in reality. Self-made, working class background, ethical center in his approach to business.   There is a political disconnect between the progressive ideologues in this country and the average voter that has to be put to bed for a progressive future. The political left needs voices that can espouse progressive goals in common sense and relatable terms while acknowledging that progress is not a binary between absolute success and abject failure. If we don’t embrace and amplify those voices, we lose even more than we’ve already lost",ChazzLamborghini,2025-03-19T10:16:14,22
"I’m increasingly convinced that it needs to be a complete, total outsider. A popular media figure who stages a very hostile takeover through support from primary voters and a cooperative media. In other words, do to the Dems what Trump did to the Reps, only this person would actually be well-meaning.  I’m thinking someone like Jon Stewart or Bill Burr. An unapologetic comedian would be interesting. But whoever it is needs to have absolutely no history of official political activity. They need to be clear of the taint of the party.  EDIT: All these comments about how “the Dems won’t allow it” are proving my point. Think back to 2015-16, the Republican establishment didn’t want to get swept away either. They don’t get a say if someone rallies the primary voters. Bernie isn’t a good comparison - like it or not, *he didn’t get enough votes to win the primary*.",seen-in-the-skylight,2025-03-19T10:01:37,69

"I find some of the commentary around Murphy's appearance on The Daily Show a little odd as a Connecticut resident. I love Jon Stewart and people have been applauding how much he ""went after"" Murphy and ""hammered him with pretty tough questions"" but everything Murphy said is what I have been hearing from him for the past few months. I guess he doesn't have crazy national recognition, but he has been pretty militant from the start and has been very critical and divergent from how the democrats have been dealing with trump. He didn't attend the SOU, and he was getting escorted out of various DOGE related buildings by private security. He has gone on record several times trying to spell out the level of corruption that we are facing right now in the Government.  I agree with conversations involving Sanders, AOC, Walz, Buttigieg, Whitmer, all these other governors etc.. and I think Murphy is clearly very passionate in this moment and nearly desperate to try and be a part of a solution. We generally like him in CT. He's very down to Earth and isn't another crazy rich politician.",enigma7x,2025-03-19T12:58:24,2

"When I see various Dems on TV, the only one who excites me is Josh Shapiro. But I'll admit even he seems a little ""rehearsed"" sometimes. He was on Bill Maher's show recently and it was more of a stump speech than a conversation. Part of that is because Maher has a tendency to be in awe of certain people and lets them control the interview (for some odd reason, he loves Fetterman). Shapiro is young, well-spoken and has a track record of getting shit done in a purple state.   I don't know a lot about Gretchen Whitmer, but she has potential as well. I don't buy the ""a woman can't possibly win"" philosophy, but I also wouldn't say being a woman is a non-factor. Kamala and Hillary weren't great candidates in general and I would argue their timing was bad. Hillary ran after 8 years of a Dem in the White House and Kamala took over last minute for a very unpopular Biden. Male or female, it would have taken a really strong candidate to win in 2016 and 2024.  Gavin Newsom is a great speaker and charismatic, but I think being from CA is a steep uphill climb. Very few of us would want our states to be run like CA. And he has a long history of policies in CA that could be classified as ""DEI"" or ""woke"", which is not great considering Trump's winning 2024 campaign was largely based on anti-DEI and anti-woke.   I'm not a huge AOC fan, but she's OK. I would like to see her get a bigger role in Congress and it really pisses me off that Pelosi helped block her. But the problem with anyone like AOC is she is already considered a ""liberal boogeyman"", like Hillary and Kamala. We don't want to let right-wing media dictate our candidates, but you also can't ignore the negative impact of years of non-stop attacks. You have to acknowledge you would be running a candidate that a large portion of the country considers ""unacceptable"". IMHO, part of why Biden was able to beat Trump in 2020 is because he was considered acceptable by most voters, despite right-wing media attacks. By 2024, that had changed.  It would be insane if Bernie played any major role in turning things around for the Dems. He may be sharp compared to Trump and Biden, but he's simply too old to even still be in Congress.

"It is answers like this that make me question whether people here are really trying to answer OP's question or whether they are say, right wing influencers trying to sow more discontent.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be a dick.  Incumbent parties losing in 2024 was a worldwide thing.  If we were back in the 1980's, Harris would have lost by double digits because of prices.  But she didn't.  She lost by like 2%.  People vote for the economy above all else and are willing to sacrifice their morals, freedoms, anything... for a few extra $'s.  The problem is that a vast majority of the voting public is 100% ignorant of how the economy works, and are unwilling to learn.  As a result, when they don't like something (like prices) they simply vote for the other party and hope that it works. However, we didn't see that in November.  Most people want the Democrats to win, they just want money more.  Expecting the Democrats to move away from where the money is is useless.  Never going to happen.  What the Democrats need is a messaging machine that will go after the 5-10% real swing voters left in the US.  They simply don't have that.  No Fox News or Daily Mail.  And the Baptist churches.

Republicans campaigned on it quite clearly, the Democrats said you don’t want to do that for XYZ and lost.

"Fucking yes! The right-wing media is critical of democrats in bad faith. They would make an enemy out of Jesus if he got in the way of their agenda (theologically speaking, they've already done this and the evangelicals love it).  Democratic candidates need to ignore the right's criticisms and hard-focus on bringing the politically homeless into their ranks. People are fed up with mainstream, institutional Democrats because they talk incessantly about social justice and ignore doing anything about the shrinking middle class, the housing and rent crisis, the crisis of confidence in   Aside from a handful of vocal members of the Democratic party, so many have just submitted to silent opposition of Trump, or even placating him in fear of opposition. The Democratic party has been dominated by out-of-touch, high-society corporatists with lofty -- albeit honorable -- social . But they lack any guts to do what it takes to secure power from the right who is pandering to the politically downtrodden that these elites have trampled all over and forgotten. Which is to deliver real results. Because for that to be able to happen, they know they will have to piss off some of their wealthiest donors who have been using them to suppress the middle and lower class.  Time to get a clue guys. People aren't happy with the way things are going. Every year, us working class and middle class folks get poorer and poorer. Our labor value slips every fucking year thanks to bad policies that favor foreign laborers or even H1Bs to people born and raised here. That use these policies to lower the value of our labor by abusing H1Bs. We're not stupid. Stop treating the voters like they can't see what's going on.",nanotree,2025-03-19T11:27:27,9
"Americans do seem to fear the specter of left-wing extremism more than they fear the actual threat of right-wing extremism. The Democrats spent so much of their campaign bandwidth on warning about the fascist threat that Trump presented, while Republicans warned of the communist woke hellscape that Harris would create (all the while, Harris bent over backwards to pivot to the center). While we can debate whether the average American is motivated by the anti-wokeism narrative, the results certainly bear out a general apathy towards the right's authoritarian tendencies.  Why? Maybe it's the fact that actual left-wing ideology is more alien to the electorate than a decades-long continuum of market-centric individualist ideology. Democrats have had little to offer for the last half-century beyond defending social reforms that their predecessors put in place in the 60's. The Heritage Foundation has been advancing and escalating ever since Nixon, and Democrats seemingly haven't been on offense since LBJ. Imagine the GOP's glee when Clinton promised to ""end welfare as we know it."" When Obama continued bailouts after the 2008 crisis. When his signature healthcare plan was effectively a subsidy for insurance companies powered by an individual mandate (a Heritage Foundation original, of course) -- which they would go on to vilify to this day.  The Democrat party certainly has been useful to the GOP as their controlled opposition, and I'm sure they're all in favor of keeping the likes of Chuck Schumer around. In this era, that is all that Democrats will continue to exist for, unless they undertake a complete ideological upheaval which actually confronts American individualism.",lelieldirac,2025-03-19T17:35:43,4

"We lose because our neither or leaders nor our rank and file can talk about middle class economics for 15 seconds without transitioning into the kind of heavily ideological rant about corporatism and neoliberalism that makes normies tune us out immediately, because it means (at *best*) literally nothing to them.  Think about how Donald Trump talks. We need to talk more like that. Bernie's ""top 1% of the top 1%"" catchphrase was a good model.  It's not even a very precise terminology to discuss our current moment. Bill Clinton was a ""corporatist"" Democrat; so was Barack Obama; so was Joe Biden. But they were not all the same, not by a longshot, and it's very clear to anybody who actually paid attention to those three presidencies which was the furthest left. (It's the one with the really old white guy.)  It's worth paying attention to what those differences are instead of flattening everybody out into ""Bernie"" and ""not Bernie"" because this party does, in fact, have more than two wings, and the Clinton/Harris/Obama types are not all that well-aligned with the Biden types on a lot of issues, especially regarding labor protections and industrial policy.",Miles_vel_Day,2025-03-20T12:42:54,1

"The harder truth is that Dems need to want to be unified and the realest truth is that many of them want to shank each other to be line leader. Moderates loathe anyone to the left of the Clintons, the left is still fixated on grievance around 2016, and establishment Dems are very concerned with their own power to an unhelpful extent that can make them contemptuous to anyone trying to make change. The thing is that strong leadership means nothing if people don’t want to be united. And sure maybe there is one person who in the right circumstances could bridge the divide, but this will remain a major weakness because no one is willing to let their grudges go. I know this is hard, but this will remain an easy thing for foreign actors to exploit if people aren’t willing to act like adults and realize we have to have priorities.  Because to that, this whole leadership discussion seems like everyone wanting the reins because they think they are uniquely right about how to fix everything. Too many people would rather watch the country burn if it means settling scores in the coalition and advancing the case for their faction to take over. But if that is what people are focused on, it seems unlikely to yield a durable leadership structure that actually addresses the complexity of the coalition democrats have.   Lastly, it seems to me that there has been a desire to have a “TV drama worthy opposition” and also a conflation of management and leadership. On the former, I fear too much emphasis is being put on the idea that normies would only wake up if Dems had a “leader” who plays well on TV. And while I ams certainly not against that, I do think this is also a lot of political hobbyists and online politicos who want to be more entertained and to have their fear alleviated so they can sit at home and treat things like a spectator sport. But the things that will actually make things happen are people doing things IRL and who know this isn’t just something you watch.   On the latter, at least to me, what you actually want in your Congressional “leaders” is good management not necessarily leadership. I do think there is a difference between leadership and management and many people often think they are interchangeable. Usually leadership is what you want for the executive, but you want really skilled managers in Congress. Sometimes you’ll get lucky and get someone good at both skill sets, but it’s rare.   Look at someone like Mitch McConnell. I constantly hear Dems say “we should be more like republicans and be ruthless like McConnell”. But the thing is, McConnell is more like Pelosi. He can speak to a camera, but he isn’t as good at that as he was at managing and whipping the caucus.   Anyway, we certainly need both managers and leaders, but I think the desire for institutional leaders to provide leadership in the way that some people want really fails to understand that institutional leadership has never been at the forefront of creating change. Look at how abolition, women’s suffrage, labor rights, and civil rights happened. It wasn’t by party leadership doing the right thing and knowing the right things to do. It was a lot of ordinary people pushing back to support those who would advance their cause and replace those who might stand in the way. Institutional political leadership is necessary, but not sufficient and I think a lot of people want to skip the hard work of creating change on the ground, and are instead hoping that continuing to punish Democrats will suddenly fix everything. It’s far easier to blame the people you can instead of actually fixing the problem.",notapoliticalalt,2025-03-19T15:48:41,18
">What the Democrats need, is a leader that will unify the party.  What they need is to find some other way to do this because that isn't going to happen.  Even if somebody was found then it would be *incredibly* easy for any malicious actor with an AI bot army to wedge this weak-kneed coalition into tiny little islands. There are a hundred pressure points where you can get 45% of the party to declare what 55% of the party wants is a horrible inhuman abomination.  This doesn't doom us by any means, but it does mean that we are not ever going to have a national leader like Trump, and probably not even one on the level of Obama, ever again. I suspect there is a way to succeed despite that. People are going to have be more tolerant of dissent within the party.  You are going to have to deal with people who think ""boys shouldn't play girl's sports"" or that ""abortion should be safe, legal and rare"" and shit. You are going to have to deal with people who use rude, insensitive language and don't believe in intersectionality. You are gonna have to deal with people who are chummy with the banks. You are not going to run the country otherwise. Even Obama was willing to pander to public opinion on gay marriage, and say he was opposed to it for most of his first term.  Trump only ""unifies"" the right through intimidation and propaganda, not actual agreement. It's not a model for any kind of good government.",Miles_vel_Day,2025-03-20T12:56:07,3

If the democratic party tries to move forward going on about restoring DEI, trans rights, and defending illegal immigrants we're screwed.  Overreaching with that crap is what opened the door for MAGA and this whole mess.  I'm not saying that those issues aren't valid, but at this moment in history restoring the structure of our democracy has to be our sole focus.  Those other discussions are just NOT going to bring moderate and reasonable republicans to the right side of this mess.  I can't help but believe that there are enough Republicans who are horrified by what's happening, or will be soon enough.  Those folks plus Democrats together are definitely a majority.  We have to give those reasonable republicans democratic candidates that they are willing to get behind in an effort to put some sanity back in our process of government.  Frankly, I blame the Biden administration for opening this door.  The vast majority of Americans felt the influx of illegal immigration was a serious issue and way too little was done way too late.  A lot of folks that were anywhere near the political middle just had enough and weren't willing to sign on for four more years of the same.

I have been reading the governments filings in the various litigations against him and they all contain the same frightening language saying he has absolute authority/unchecked authority (paraphrasing) that is not subject to judicial review. And he is making these representations to what is supposed to be a co-equal branch of government - the judiciary.

Yeah, they're probably about as dead as Republicans after the 2008 election.  I do worry about major disruptions to elections but the fact is our elections are locally run. Trumpists are going to have limited leverage in a lot of states.  You aren't going to fix the election in North Carolina when they have a Democratic governor. You might get their legislature to withhold their electors or something, but when you make a power grab like that you have to be very sensitive to making yourself look like a watering can for the Tree of Liberty.  A more likely model of the legitimacy crisis would probably be Democrats winning big in the midterms but then Trump ignoring everything they do in flagrant violation of the law. Then Republicans would have to start figuring out how to rig 2028, if they didn't want to fall out of power entirely, because their popularity would likely sink even lower.",Miles_vel_Day,2025-03-20T13:07:23,1
"I did not mean the party is cooked as in the Dems will not win future elections. In fact, I think the opposite. Assuming we still have elections, I think Trump will be a disaster that will usher in democrats again. The problem is that I think Dems will get away with nominating a “let’s get back to normalcy” corporate Dem such as Newsome that will not bring about the change that people are seeking. This lack of fundamental change is why we get the cycle of a “moderate” Dem followed by a crazy right wing Republican. This will perpetuate the rightward shift of the Overton window.   The disaster that these republicans are and will continue to be allows democrats to get away with paying lip service to the challenges working people face while offering very little if any bold ideas. Dems run on “hope and change” and deliver little breadcrumbs or nothing at all, and the cycle repeats.  This cycle will continue to repeat itself because corporate dems cannot actually deliver on real change that most in this country yearn for due to the fact that they answer to the same corporate donor class that republicans do.

That doesn't mean that it's not a good idea, just that it's going to be really hard for the intellectual wing to know when they're looking at it.  I think a good first step to being a Dem populist would be to stop playing along with the fiction that the legacy media represents the facts well, and attack them with every bit of viciousness as Trump does.

Super Tuesday showed just how little support each candidate who dropped out had.   Biden's campaign bet was hinged on winning SC and doing well on Super Tuesday. Sanders campaign bet was win early and maintain his 35% vote total and have the other candidates fight for the remaining 65%.   Sanders problem was that one Super Tuesday, Biden was also getting 30%+ of the vote which lead the others to realize they had no path to win.",Brysynner,2025-03-19T12:42:57,4

"So you honestly believe that if Bernie somehow made an incredible, miraculous comeback and somehow overtook the delegate lead from Hillary. The Superdelegates would've backed her anyway?  Bernie lost, not because of Superdelegates, but his own lack of GOTV, lack of competing in southern states, and lack of ability to grow his coalition. If he cut into her leads in Flordia and Texas early on, he might've been a contender. But after Super Tuesday he was down by 191 pledged delegates and was unable to beat her by margins needed to overtake her lead.",Brysynner,2025-03-19T12:28:08,7
"I think the lesson of the more recent primaries, especially on the Democratic side, is that the early states do *not* matter more, because they are not representative of the broader Democratic primary electors, which is much more diverse and urban. The super delegates are not why the race was over after Super Tuesday in 2016. The race was over because states that were not dominated by white liberals started voting and overwhelmingly supported Clinton (IIRC Sanders did not even hit the 15% delegate threshold in some majority black districts in the south).",pierrebrassau,2025-03-19T12:57:50,3
"They mostly announced their support long before Bernie Sanders joined the party or announced his candidacy, so... that's not going to stand up too well to scrutiny if you remember that events in the future can't cause events in the past.

You can tell because everyone in the Clinton wing of the party still hates sanders and many still blame him for her loss.   191 pledged delegates is nothing when you need several thousand to win.

\+ 191 is alot when there are no winner take all states. But after Super Tuesday she had 606 out of 1021 pledge delegates. That's 59.3% of all pledged delegates at that point. That's a huge lead politically.   I'm not sure how he would've done in the general. The party might help him with some of the weaker aspects of his campaign (GOTV) so he might have won but Sanders still has yet to face major oppo research in a campaign so it could be quite worse if he made it to the general.,Brysynner,2025-03-19T12:55:41,3

She could've hammered him more on his rape fantasy essay saying that clearly he was a sexual predator who feels like women want to be raped and get off on being raped. She could've said for as much as he complains about career politicians, that is exactly what he is since he's been running for political office since 1972 and since 1981, his only job was being in government. She could say part of his motivation to not get a real job and continually run for office was so he he didn't pay have to pay child support because his only money is going to the campaigns. She could've said that he was so lazy he got kicked out of a commune in the early 1970s for refusing to work. She could've said his honeymoon to the USSR show he is friendly to enemies of the US.
