I’d vote for him but I’m sad all our candidates seem to need to swim upstream because of having to defy the   hatred of bigots.,leontes,2025-05-02T11:16:15,6
"I think Pete isn't just aiming to win the Iowa primary again. The man's trying to sow real goodwill there, so that if he gets the nomination, he'll have one wildcard state that could potentially push him over the edge  Imagine a 2028 where the Pete Buttigieg/Raphael Warnock ticket wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia, but loses all the other battleground states. Those 6 electoral votes from Iowa are suddenly worth their weight in gold",RVarki,2025-05-02T19:28:27,3

"I like Pete, he's a great explainer, but that doesn't win elections. He needs to embrace what Bernie and AOC are doing.",LargeWu,2025-05-02T11:50:16,-2

Which is great.  He's one of the best potential candidates out there,aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-02T12:32:25,8
"I would totally vote for Pete. My question ultimately though is can he win? America has shown that a cruel ignorant liar, is going to win over a reasonable woman candidate. Do we really think an open gay man will win? Again I am not opposed to Pete for pres but gosh I can see the ignorant attack adds just write themselves",abraxius,2025-05-02T13:43:05,2
"Dude won the Iowa primary (edit: caucus) in 2020, he tends to know what he’s doing better than most pols.",eggoed,2025-05-02T12:34:07,12
"Pete right now is the lone Democrat that's going on right wing podcasts and news stations and trying to convince the right of the lies from that right and explaining his positions to them.  Like it or not, this needs to be done instead of that side controlling the narrative.   I don't see AOC or Bernie doing much of this. I like both of them, I could see AOC as a presidential candidate but she's still speaking only to the left .",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-02T13:26:29,5
"He’s not going to embrace what they’re doing because he doesn’t fundamentally believe in the same things they do. That’s what’s missing about a lot of these milquetoast centrist democrats, they don’t actually believe in anything that might upset their donors. It’s all political theater for them",kooldarkplace,2025-05-02T20:55:52,-3
Hundreds of thousands of average Americans donated to Buttigieg.  His campaign was run on small dollar donations.,aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-02T11:47:17,3
"You can say that about any serious candidate that gains traction, Democrat or Republican, that's America's current system.",biscuitarse,2025-05-02T11:19:08,2
Even if he actively pursued and received donations from 61 billionaires?  https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2020/03/03/these-are-the-61-billionaires-who-spent-money-on-pete-buttigiegs-now-defunct-campaign/,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-02T12:49:20,-5
If Biden hadn't run in 2020 Buttigieg probably would have won,aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-03T00:17:55,0
"Hundreds of thousands of average americans donated to trump. Are you going to claim therefore the billionaires don’t own trump?  You can’t have one rule for trump and another for pete, if you genuinely want change. If you want more of the same then yes go right ahead and believe politicians that take money from billionaires will turn around and bite the very hand that feeds them.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/michelatindera/2020/03/03/these-are-the-61-billionaires-who-spent-money-on-pete-buttigiegs-now-defunct-campaign/",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-02T12:25:28,-4
"If they don’t have the guts to take on the billionaires, they aren’t a serious candidate, they’re just a selfish one.",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-02T11:20:49,-5
"We’re in a post citizens united world. There will never be a viable candidate again that doesn’t receive funding from billionaires. Hell that was the entire point, to either destroy the democrats ability to fundraise competitively or ruin their messaging by forcing them to cozy up to wealth even more than they were before.",closedf0rbusiness,2025-05-02T15:59:52,6
"Shows he's able to get support even from people he wants to tax and regulate more?  He had 100,000 individual donors. How is it relevant that some of those donating $2,800 or less were rich? He didn't have a campaign co-chair with a net worth of over $100m like Bernie did.",indri2,2025-05-02T13:30:29,5
Eh idk but I think it woulda been pretty chaotic if Bernie had still been in. Without Biden he woulda put up a tough fight. If both Bernie and Biden hadn’t run then maybe but it woulda been an interesting messy campaign imo.,eggoed,2025-05-03T00:52:16,2
Your facile understanding of your own country's political system is showing,biscuitarse,2025-05-02T11:56:09,6
"No, they just don’t deal in oversimplified explanations of complex situations like Reddit comments.",ElderSmackJack,2025-05-02T11:47:49,3
that’s why pete got outraised by a 78 year old democratic socialist. lol try harder to convince us that we have to accept billionaire money in the democratic party. If you want billionaire money in the party then you are part of the problem.,LongLiveFDR,2025-05-02T17:31:30,-2
"how is it relevant that pete is saying he will help the working class whilst chasing and accepting money from the billionaires?  Just think about it for a minute, that’s all I ask.  Either politicians will stand up for the working class or they will stand up for the billionaires.   You are suggesting pete will take billionaires money and then stand up for the working class. That’s a fine argument to make, but i hope everyone thinks about that claim.",LongLiveFDR,2025-05-02T13:33:59,-2
"I did think about it for more than a minute. Even if you assume that Pete (or some other politician) can be easily bought by some campaign donations the numbers don't add up. He got about $100m from 100,000 individual donors. Even if those 50 or 60 billionaires gave the maximum of $2,800 each it's still less than 0.2% of the overall sum. Why do you think those 0.2% would change his policies but the 99.8% would not?  Pete's proposed policies would have helped the working class, paid by higher taxes from the rich.  None of his policies during the 2020 campaign changed to favor rich people. His policies as Secretary helped consumers against airlines and made transportation more affordable for people with low income.  If you want an actual example of candidates influenced by their donors look how Warren and Sanders competed which each other with policies that would specifically help a large part of their donors (middle or upper middle class, college educated, student loans) while dismissing any proposal to limit the benefits to lower incomes. They tried to explain it with some ideological argument but obviously this would have been regressive compared to Pete's plans of focusing on k-12 and a more targeted help for college students.",indri2,2025-05-02T14:45:28,5
"And the commenter's user name praises FDR, one of the richest presidents in history, who was a multimillionaire scion of an aristocratic family, so I don't know why they have a problem with less than 1% of Buttigieg's donors",aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-02T17:20:04,6
