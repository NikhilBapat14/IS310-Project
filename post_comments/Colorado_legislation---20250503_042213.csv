"- should be criminalized in every state, now way easy to do with AI and there is no recourse at the moment",decaturbob,2025-05-03T05:24:11,15

But I can still draw or paint fake nudes of real people right?    There's a famous painting of a nude Bea Arthur that sold for $2mm.    https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5684049,FrostingLegal7117,2025-05-03T08:13:06,5
Personally there’s a pretty good chance that a fake nude would look better so go for it as far as I’m concerned.,Minguseyes,2025-05-03T04:23:59,3
"The fact that it isn't a crime globally tells you all you need to know about the state of politics. No common sense, no will to get off their backsides and make some positive change. Or have I got this wrong and it's just a USA thing?",FrankTooby,2025-05-04T03:24:00,1
So painting a picture of a nude model would be illegal?,BroadSide951,2025-05-03T05:05:21,-3
"I mean, it's criminalized in 37 states at this point.  It will get to all of them soon enough.",FantasticJacket7,2025-05-03T05:48:10,6
"Tell me you don’t know how AI image/content generation works without telling me you don’t know how AI image generation works. This is the kind of dumb idea politicians come up with and try to force on people.   It isn’t regulated, and can’t be enforced. Anyone can make a new checkpoint. Anyone can make a webUI. Anyone can strip metadata or remove steganographic data. Take a screenshot or photo of a picture.   If something lacks that watermark, how do you prove beyond reasonable doubt that it’s even AI generated, as models get better and better?  The fact is, this particular cat is well and truly out of the bag.   People need to adapt, think critically about what they see, and consume data more carefully. It’s a big ask for some people, I know, but I don’t think there’s an alternative.  This isn’t even going into the philosophical and semantic issues like AI vs photoshop, generation vs manipulation and retouching, any of the above vs painting or drawing. What if it’s protected as parody? What is art and what is not?  Nothing is ever so simple",agaloch2314,2025-05-03T12:09:56,1
"This would be as effective as current movie piracy laws, and there are millions of illegal streams every day. It’s so extremely easy to disable/erase the water mark, or just don’t update the two year old software that can already make these illegal images.",getschooledbro314,2025-05-03T23:14:44,1
Hmmmm good question; what if they use AI to create a nude non-photo realistic picture?,Hour_Gur4995,2025-05-03T10:06:50,3
I’d imagine “fake nude” represents something that the subject didn’t participate in and wasn’t sanctioned by said subject.,gods_Lazy_Eye,2025-05-03T06:31:01,10
"No because they \*were\* nude. The nuance of this sorta thing is gonna be tricky but the issue is the use of AI to make nude/fake images of people with just their face. Hell Facebook adverts keep popping up for me advertising ""hey try on any clothes"" but the advert is a woman taking her selfie and getting a load of super suggestive scantily clad videos of ""her"" in very revealing outfits. Need to get on this with legislation (same as things like revenge porn) to make sure it doesn't become epidemic, and hurt people.",Semajal,2025-05-03T05:14:42,5

- will only get worse as who enforces? Especially when it can cross state and international lines any more. - the most effective way would place on the ISP as they are the conduit for all things but they have pretty much gotten immunity from being responsible,decaturbob,2025-05-04T04:13:46,1
"I didn't know people were still doing the ""tell me without telling me"" thing anymore.     Regulate the major platforms to encode a cryptographic watermark directly in the files upon generation.  Obviosuly not a visible watermark and obviously not in the metadata.   It's not perfect and could certainly be overcome by modifying the files further, but it's better than nothing.   Get the proprietary foundational models on board and it's a step in the right direction.  ",sometimes_rite,2025-05-03T16:58:29,1
So drawing Trump naked and fat would be illegal?,TintedApostle,2025-05-03T06:58:08,5
The AI art genie is already out of the bottle. No amount of legislation can stop it really.,blazze_eternal,2025-05-03T05:25:48,0
"Because it’s accurate.   It’s not just imperfect, it’s pointless. There’s a new major platform every week, from any random country. Who regulates them? What stops them moving hosting to other unregulated countries?  Regulation requires legislation, enforcement, etc.  It’s a huge undertaking, even once people agree on what that regulation looks like - that can be undone by taking a screen grab and pasting it into another program. Pointless.",agaloch2314,2025-05-03T21:10:57,2
That seems more akin to satire where the intention of the law is more about sexual violation.,pethanct01,2025-05-03T10:09:34,2
The photography genie is out of the bottle but that doesn't mean we can't make child pornography illegal.   AI exists and will always exist at this point but that doesn't mean we can't deem certain actions taken with AI to be illegal.,FantasticJacket7,2025-05-03T05:46:52,9
