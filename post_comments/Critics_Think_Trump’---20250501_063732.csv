Edit: I remember it was so offensive because he was like, ""Let us pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is pulling in terrible ratings,"" or something like that.  I told my dad, a Trump supporter, but also a devout Catholic, about the prayer breakfast and he laughed. He thought it was hilarious that Trump was ""joking,"" and I couldn't convince him that it was no joke.

"Is Vance really that capable though? Truly, is he actually intelligent? Being well-spoken does not explicitly confer intelligence. I’m not denying that Vance is smarter than the average layman, but is he truly intelligent? Everyone and everything Trump touches dies. We have witnessed this time and time again throughout his last administration and the break in-between. Vance was openly anti-Trump and then turned heel when daddy Thiel said “get inside there”. Sure he’s smart enough to know how to get close to power, but jumping on Trump’s sinking ship is not an intelligent move.   Anyone who is intelligent and also knows a thing or two about history knows the only way this ends is with a prison sentence or more likely how Mussolini or Ceaușescu ended up. With the rate at which they’re ratfucking America, the second outcome becomes more likely by the day. Their short term “wins” will be longer for when the long-term consequences and everyday Americans go looking for their throats to proverbially choke. Already he will never live a comfortable life without shame and harassment for the rest of his miserable life, Trump’s stink will be a black mark on him forever. Furthermore, if he were truly intelligent, he would realize he lacks the charisma and influence of Trump and even third-rate folks orbiting Trump. His own voter base consistently mocks him and they also openly insulted and cast racist aspersions on his wife. If he were intelligent he’d know that no matter what he does he’ll never be respected enough to secure and maintain power.   While I think Vance is far more capable and effective at mobilizing and organizing efforts to undermine democracy and our rights, I believe he lacks the self-awareness and intelligence to do so in a durable fashion. Honestly Vance taking over seems like it would kick off an implosion of the party as infighting for the “throne” would kick off due to the perceived power vacuum.

In 2022 everyone predicted a red wave, but Democrats increased their Senate seats and only lost 9 House seats... some of which were due to redistricting losses! Trump wasn't on the ballot, MAGA didn't do as well. Despite MANY candidates aping his style/policies. 4. In 2024 Trump outperformed Republicans as a whole, with many voters ONLY voting for President.

"Agreed. It's also because it's the same basic idea behind Executives at major American corporations. More than anything else they need to make sure you're ""one of them"". They don't want someone to speak truth to power, introduce new ideas or anything that upsets the status quo. That status quo varies between parties but it's still the same idea.

"Except for one small problem - Donald Trump did not win by being far right, at least as ""far right"" was understood in 2015.   Protectionist tariffs and mercantilism, isolationism, as well as aggressive state intervention in the economy are well to the left of Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden.   He won by redefining the terms the American right operates under - ending laissez faire in favor of pure cronyism one hand, but also implicitly promising to roll back things like the expansion of the labor market since the 1950s on the other. And of course, promising a return of segregation and an end to women's rights.   I think his voters will forgive him the economic looting if he keeps delivering on the culture war promises that every Republican since Nixon gave lip service to. But we will see.   Either way, though, Democrats can't just ""run left"" - they need to tear down their entire policy consensus and start again.",AdHopeful3801,2025-05-02T10:09:07,1

Exactly. DEI policies love white veterans and deprived white people because they have always been criticized for being “anti-white.”  I met a young woman at a party who had gone to a top university after growing up in Appalachia and she had very mixed feelings about it. She felt very alienated from the posh kids at the school and felt like she might have just been there to make the stats look good (imposter syndrome: she was very smart). I suspect Vance had similar issues that led him to overcompensate to make sure he was truly accepted by the elite.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-01T10:08:31,17
