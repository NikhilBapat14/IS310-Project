"The main reason is probably that the candidate doesn't want to run again after the demoralizing defeat. They don't want to be remembered as the guy that got defeated again and again. Losing a second time would reaffirm that the country really doesn't want them, and potentially ruin the legacy of their achievements outside the presidential race.   And the voters probably usually agree with them that its time to move on and try a different candidate. If you didn't win your party the presidency last time, they can't expect you to win it this time. Especially since the second attempt would most likely be a rematch against the person you lost to, with the added advantage of incumbency.   In the early 1900s there were a few candidates who ran multiple times and they all lost. William Jennings Bryan was the nominee for the Democrats in 3 elections, in 1896, 1900, and 1908. Thomas Dewey was the Republican candidate twice in 1944 and 1948. Adlai Stevenson was the nominee for the Democrats twice in 1952 and 1956.   In modern history, the only candidate to be successful after failing the first time was Nixon. He was Vice President under Eisenhower for 8 years, then he lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK, then he lost the 1962 election to for California Governor, then in 1968 he came back and won the presidency. For most people, after losing the presidency and even losing the governor's race in his home state, they would just retire there. So his second attempt was one most people would have given up on, and it was 8 years later, against a different opponent, which may have been what made it different than the other attempts.",Cyrus_the_Meh,2024-08-08T12:28:39,17
Al Gore had actually considered running in 2004 but 9/11 and W's meteoric popularity rise convinced him to retire from politics for good.   [https://nymag.com/news/features/al-gore-2013-5/](https://nymag.com/news/features/al-gore-2013-5/),federalist66,2024-08-08T12:10:00,13
"It’s also incredibly expensive. Some candidates can afford to run again, but normally even just one failed attempt has the potential to bankrupt you.",jackBattlin,2024-08-08T13:37:47,5
"They probably would lose primary since people would be doubtful they can win , boredom and most were very replaceable by another establishment white guy. There has also been relatively few ""impressive in loss"" elections. Like if Obama vs Romney came down to one state with Obama winning it by 0.3% maybe you could say Romney did really well as underdog against Obama so they should run him again.",RusevReigns,2024-08-15T22:16:41,1
My guess is that the respective political party doesn't want to nominate them when they lost therfore not wasting effort on them ever again,kamslam25,2024-10-24T13:35:48,1

You say they all lost but Grover Cleveland didn't want to be president on two non-consecutive occasions and upon leaving the White House he gave the staff instructions to not move any of the furniture because he would be back in 4 years,LordJesterTheFree,2024-08-08T17:28:21,4

"Plus, I think American voters are always looking for that new shiny thing. They also love a winner and are less inclined to get behind a loser. I sure hope this trend continues at least for the short term.",ABobby077,2024-08-08T16:49:42,3

"I think he was personally demoralized. When he ran for governor, he promised not to run for President, because he intended to be serving as governor for a full term. And despite not winning that term as governor, he still decided not to run again. At the time JFK was very popular, and then obviously he was assassinated and LBJ received a swell of support as well. So the 1964 election was looking to be a solid win for Democrats. Nixon might have realized that if he actually wanted to win he shouldn't run right when the whole country was united in support of the Democrats. If he had put his name in the race he probably could have won the nomination, but for his career it worked out better to skip an election he would have lost and make a comeback in the next one.",Cyrus_the_Meh,2024-08-15T20:57:14,1
