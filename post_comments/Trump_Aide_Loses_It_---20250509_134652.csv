‚ÄúPresident Trump aced his cognitive test‚Äù- how do we know? He‚Äôs constantly lying. And the test he described is for people whose challenges are already severe.,Needleworker3000,2025-05-09T13:53:54,120
"Steven Cheung is a cancer on this country. He and Stephen Miller put the bad ideas in his head and words in his mouth. Without these two, Trump would be a golfing potatobrain, but with them, he's given the worst words to support the worst policies.  It's funny how 5 years ago, Trump was saying he's not a puppet, but it's pretty clear that it's exactly what and all he is.",TSAOutreachTeam,2025-05-09T13:54:00,271
"He's so narcissistic that I think that alone is his mental illness. It's so extreme to the point that it's mind boggling. He has lied so many times that I think that he actually believes that his lies are the truth. Donald Trump made the startling claim that ""global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."" He believes that vaccines cause Autism. He stood in front of tens of thousands of supporters and mocked a disabled man and then said that it never happened. He says that Elon Musk never flashed a Nazi salute despite it being caught on camera.",Long-Tip-5374,2025-05-09T13:49:52,38

"‚ÄúA prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of free people.‚Äù  -Declaration Of Independence, 1776",ToxicComputing,2025-05-09T16:56:26,12
"Declaration of Broken Contract When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for the people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them to a governing body that no longer abides by its own Constitution, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all persons are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Justice. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to withhold consent, to demand redress, and to seek the restoration of lawful and just governance. The social contract has been broken. The government has failed in its most fundamental obligation: to protect and represent the People, as required by the Constitution. The sacred promise of representation (Article I, Section 2), due process (Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments), and equal protection under the law (Fourteenth Amendment) has been violated. When leaders defy constitutional limits, disregard judicial authority, and use public funds to abuse, neglect, or silence the governed, the moral and legal legitimacy of their authority collapses. In this condition, taxation becomes exploitation, a direct violation of the founding American principle: ""No taxation without representation."" This principle, enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and echoed in the Petition Clause of the First Amendment, affirms the right of citizens to withhold consent when governmental legitimacy is lost through systemic violation of the Constitution. Therefore, we assert that We the People cannot be compelled to fund a system that no longer honors its constitutional duties. To do so would be to participate in our own oppression, and further enable the erosion of our liberties. Until justice is restored, representation honored, and constitutional protections upheld, we reserve under our First Amendment rights, the right to withhold consent, demand redress, and pursue all lawful means of restoring a government that serves its people. LIBERTY OR NOTHING AT ALL --- GRIEVANCES --- 1. Violation of Due Process Rights (Fifth & Fourteenth Amendments) - U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained and deported without legal hearings or access to counsel. Examples: VML, a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, deported to Honduras. A 4-year-old cancer patient, deported with family. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, deported in defiance of court order. 2. Violation of Equal Protection (Fourteenth Amendment) - Citizens of specific ethnic or national backgrounds disproportionately targeted for deportation or data surveillance. 3. Illegal Disclosure of Personal and Financial Data (Privacy Act of 1974 & Fourth Amendment) - Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) accessed IRS and Treasury data (SSNs, bank info) without legal basis. 4. Violation of ""No Taxation Without Representation"" - Citizens are being taxed by a government failing to uphold constitutional duties. 5. Suppression of Redress and Petition (First Amendment) - Citizens who speak out or file complaints face retaliation or are ignored.",These-Photo-5731,2025-05-09T18:04:20,9
