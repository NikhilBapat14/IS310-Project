"For those who know evangelical Christians it's been obvious for a while that their politics and their religion have become the same thing, there is no distinction. It's why bipartisanship has completely ended, they will not compromise on anything because they believe they are doing the will of God, and that going against Trump is going against God.",The_Navy_Sox,2025-04-28T15:24:30,50

"Many evangelicals don’t understand the Gospels. They believe that YOU are going to Hell, because YOU’RE not in their club.  Many believe that their “good works” like voting for the “most Christianest candidate”, gets them brownie points. How could someone like Trump represent a Christlike lifestyle…I want to laugh at the stupidity but it’s truly hypocrisy and it’s causing people to suffer.  Then you have the fucking MAGA pastors like Rob McCoy who talk politics instead of preaching sermons. Evangelicals have gone bananas since the 80s. Many have utterly no clue who Jesus was or what he taught and did. He’s just in a painting with a lamb in the sanctuary. Maybe, it’s just become a social club, and a way to feign piety, while gossiping in many churches.  Love your neighbor as you love yourself - pretty easy to understand.   If you don’t love your brother who you can see how can you love God who you can’t see.   They see their brother but he’s brown and speaks Spanish, so it’s okay to deprive him of his rights.",industrial-complex,2025-04-28T15:37:18,12

Evangelicals are primed for this because they are taught since childhood to keep their heads down and think/act like sheep.  They have to be good little rule followers while the leaders of their flock are allowed to behave like predators.  This is why such a disconnect can occur with the faithful prostrating themselves in front of a sick bastard like Trump.,snurdleysneed,2025-04-28T21:20:42,2

"Also warned us the Beast would want everyone to wear His mark on their head or their hand to trade...  The false prophets, the masses of Christians flocking to his banner... The natural disasters that would unfold both prior and during the Beast's reign.   Revelation 13:4 - And they gave worship to the *beast* saying, “*Who is like the beast*, and who can wage-war against him?”  He even had a ""fatal head injury"" and ""miraculously recovered"" (quotes because we pretty much know at this point that the assassination attempt didn't actually hit his head/ear, as it didn't leave a scar/wound just 2 weeks later.)  If he is literally, THE Beast of the Sea, as warned by Revelation, then at least he'll only have power for 42 months.

"Furthermore they've pretty much gone all in on end times dogma. It's why they support Israel so fanatically, as it plays a role into the idea that the end of the world will come. Evangelical Christians aren't just preparing for the end of the world, but are actively working towards it. It's why they're not bothered with polluting the planet.  Americans make fun of Muslims for the belief of the 72 virgins BS, but all along we should rightfully be making fun of Evangelicals that espouse the paradise and rapture after the end of the world. And if God somehow supports these people who work to bring about the end of the world, then send me to hell because that is not a God I want to be a part of.",nubyplays,2025-04-28T16:25:08,25

"Christian Zionism is in my opinion, bs. It is in conflict with the New Testament. In short without sounding preachy, If Jesus is the Messiah, then God’s promises to Israel were all fulfilled in Jesus. Therefore, if a Jew or anyone else wants to be a Christian, they would need to believe in Jesus as the Messiah. Romans chapter 11 sums this up using an analogy of the branches of an olive tree, so you don’t have to take my condensed paraphrasing. There’s also the parable of the Good Samaritan, which demonstrates how we’re supposed to treat all foreigners, but that’s just conveniently ignored too.",industrial-complex,2025-04-28T17:26:39,4
