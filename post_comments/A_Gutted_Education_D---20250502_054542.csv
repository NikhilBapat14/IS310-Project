The Department of Education going from Anti-Discrimination to Pro-Discrimination is beyond parody,blues111,2025-05-02T05:52:02,13
"Hi r/politics,  The Trump administration is subverting the traditional priorities of the Education Department’s decimated civil rights office by making discrimination investigations practically impossible.  Instead, the department has ordered several civil rights investigations on its own — targeting schools with trans athletes, gender-neutral bathrooms and initiatives it sees as discriminatory to white students.  **Here's the full story:** [https://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-donald-trump-discrimination](https://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-civil-rights-donald-trump-discrimination)  Thanks for reading.  \---  If you are someone who has been impacted by the dismantling of the civil rights office, we want to hear from you. You can reach out on Signal at 917-512-0201 or [get in touch here](https://www.propublica.org/getinvolved/help-propublica-report-on-department-of-ed-ocr-civil-rights-cases).",propublica_,2025-05-02T05:54:58,4
