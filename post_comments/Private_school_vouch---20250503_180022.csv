Brit here   Are they getting rid of state funded schools? And replacing it with privatised education?  If so then that’s fucked up and opens up a serious can of worms,cup-of-tea-76,2025-05-03T18:20:25,5
"FIrst flush, I thought, ""fine, it costs my district in the NE more per student for a public education, so it saves money""  However, a portion of my property tax, more than half, goes to the school district budget. We don't have a specific high school, so there is a choice there, and technically the one my kids went to is considered a private school.  On the other hand, everyone who pays property tax is paying for education, whether you have a kid or not. So if you don't want to send your kid to the publicly funded one, oh well.   And why do I envision a bunch of Trump academies opening in Texas?",Biodiversity1001,2025-05-03T20:36:16,2

Exactly. This is always how government subsidies work. Especially for education where they can just make up whatever price they want for tuition.   I would never send my kid to a Texas public school but I also should pay for my own damn kids if I choose the private option.,TexasInsights,2025-05-03T21:38:01,13

So they will give rich people who can afford private schools $10K but make the rest undereducated.  Besides private schools are not required to take the standardized testing program and may be worse than public schools.,Any_Brick1860,2025-05-03T18:03:56,7

"Another fair thing would be if you accept vouchers that is the only money the private school can take. So no vouchers taking 10k off your 20k tuition. If the private schools moan that's not enough to run off of, well then maybe you need to fund your education way better.",broccolilord,2025-05-04T07:39:24,1
"Not getting rid of it.... yet.  The idea is that if you go to a public school, the state pays for your education. But if you go to a private school it doesn't.

"Not directly, but it will kill a whole bunch of rural schools as a byproduct. Rural schools in Texas were already woefully underfunded, and this is going to screw then in a whole bunch of ways. I think it was Propublica that put out some great reporting on the problem a few years ago.  Republican legislators in rural districts actually fought against this the last time Abbott tried pushing vouchers through. Unfortunately, Abbott has spent the time since doing his best to gut that opposition. This is going to be one hell of a self-inflicted wound.",bluestrike2,2025-05-03T19:47:08,1
"> Private schools work because they are exclusive  They'll still get to be exclusive.  Just because you have some money plus this voucher won't mean your desired school is required to accept your kid.  They'll get to pick the kids they like and exclude any they don't like (behavior, background, skin color, etc.).  All this whole effort will do is help ensure that non-white kids or kids with problems aren't allowed in the more preferable schools.  If you have one of these kids, you'll probably end up paying more to get less education.",grandzooby,2025-05-03T20:05:14,3

"Im not rich and I send my child to a private school which ends after elementary. We just chose the school that was also their daycare.  They are religious but have many Hindus in the school. I'm not religious and nor is mom, we just chose this route.  It was one of the most expensive in our state.     With all that, I still do not want that tax credit. Why? Because there were deeply religious parents in that school.  Deeper than the ownership.  It's just real fucking hard to find a private school that's not religious that has a class size of under 10 per grade.    We just got lucky where we live and a bit of our income. The kids start public school once they pass 5th. I wish the American education system was better.  We wanted to give our kids a head start. They have learned to take learning seriously and enjoy it.  They have become extremely inquisitive kids so much they now question religion.  Lol!",Witty-Revolution8742,2025-05-03T18:25:28,1

"Thanks for answering   That’s just as fucked up.   I’m not anti private education, if someone has the means and the funds to boost their kids education then fair play but public money should be invested in helping those less fortunate, those in deprived neighbourhoods to give kids a chance in breaking the cycle of poverty and lack of opportunities   It’s literally putting another run on a ladder for those that already have an express route to success  Lifting people out of poverty should be a priority in a capitalist utopia so none of this makes sense other than screwing over minorities and keeping them at the bottom",cup-of-tea-76,2025-05-03T18:56:46,4

"You’re not creating demand, vouchers are spending-neutral, spending is just shifted from one school to another.
