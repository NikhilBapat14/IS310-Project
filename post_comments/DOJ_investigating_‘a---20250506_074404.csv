"I'm Protestant and was raised in Protestantism, however I have spent a lot of time around Catholics as several of my mom's friends are devout about the Catholicism (both Catholicism and Protestantism are Christian but to overly simplify this, the Catholics believe in a ton of things that Protestants do not).  One of the things Catholicism believes in that Protestantism rejects is the idea that you have to confess your sins to your preacher who can then offer you forgiveness from the Holy Spirit. So if you beat your wife, cheat on your husband, have homosexual ""thoughts and urges,"" enjoy daydreaming about brutally murdering people who annoy you a little too much, sell sex to feed your family, watch porn, contemplate getting divorced because you are unhappy in your marriage for whatever reason/s, get an abortion (or even consider it), have premarital sex and/or extramarital sex, disagree with the pope, struggle with substance abuse, gossip about celebrities, play with Ouija boards, smack your children around your house or generally do literally anything that Catholicism has deemed to be sinful, you have to confess it to your preacher (""Father"") who will then forgive you for your sins by having you recite what he determines to be an appropriate number of Hail Mary prayers and Our Father prayers. The pastor is also supposed to keep anything you tell him absolutely confidential, you and him and God are the only ones who are supposed to know what happens when you are confessing to your sins in there.  There's no such thing as ""confession"" in any Protestant church and if you start confessing some sins to a Protestant preacher (such as physically abusing your spouse and/or children for example) there is no expectation that he or she will forever stay silent on the situation.  I am 1000% supporting any abuse getting reported to the appropriate authorities, especially if it's physical and/or sexual abuse (or the threat of such) being inflicted on particularly vulnerable people like women, children, disabled people and senior citizens regardless of literally anything else.",bakerfredricka,2025-05-06T11:19:23,3

[Example case](https://apnews.com/article/mormon-church-child-sex-abuse-e02ae4470a5a53cbeb9aa146ff2762ac).

">Nobody else has their focus on confidential confession  This is not true.  As someone who was involved when this bill was first introduced three years ago: the requirement to report even confessions comes because Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons constantly claim their internal investigations are their closest equivalent to a confessional and are therefore covered by confessional privilege because it's baked into their doctrine.  I can cite multiple cases for the JWs, and the Mormons [took theirs to the AZ Supreme Court and won](https://apnews.com/article/mormon-church-child-sex-abuse-e02ae4470a5a53cbeb9aa146ff2762ac).  The decision was because of JWs, Mormons, and Scientology constantly attempting to abuse confessional privilege.  You can't exempt Catholic confessional without opening the door to these abuses.  Five other states already don't exempt confessional, including Texas and Rhode Island (the most Catholic state in the US).  The Catholic lobby strategy has been to claim the bill was about them.  It's a self-victim complex.  Even though that was never the intent of the legislature, they've managed to shove this into people's mind, and you're playing into it.

They do not care to bother learning what the Catholic Church teaches about abusing or hurting children.

Also, they KNOW that most priests will stay true to their vocation, and should any hear of abuse, they'll advise this person to do the only right thing they can and talk to someone about it, but, they cannot compel them. If someone finds out and arrests that priest (how would they find out), then that's another priest out of the way behind bars.  For most people, it \*is\* about children's safety, but given how pro-abortion our culture is, I'm not convinced children's safety is at the top of everyone's list of priorities. It's plausible that some see this as a hopeful way to simply have less priests overall, but you won't hear them spell it out like that.

"Dumbest take I've seen in this thread.   Their actions speak volumes. People are listening and watching and walking away. The churches are causing this.   Also what a fantastic way to whitewash the atrocities committed by the Catholic Church  üôå  ""With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil - that takes religion.""",oh-ya-its-me,2025-05-07T17:01:07,1
"I only ask because I looked at your early post history and a few years back it seems you were creeping on a 14 year old girl in there (deleting old posts only does so much)... so either your around 18, which means you don't know dick about dick, or you're older and this topic upsets you because it literally affects you directly.",whatsupeveryone34,2025-05-07T14:49:22,2
"I actually resisted saying your comment was the most ignorant take earlier. Whoops lol      ""Nowhere in the law is there any requirement to break any tenants of a religion. That would be an absurd violation.""   If it were to go through and priests must break the Seal of confession, that's what would be happening. I get why - it's the safety of children in question. Again, I just don't see the reasoning as completely altruistic like that, because not everyone in our society cares about the well-being of children.       You yourself have demonstrated what I'm talking about.       ""The regime is on the forefront of breaking down freedom of religion and separation of Church and state. Keep your religion out of our government.""  It's primarily about the government for you, not the safety of kids.       As you said, we don't burn heretics anymore, remember? Not that we should, but you think there'd be as much of a worry about ""repeat offenders"" if that were on the table?  Lol, please. The Church will be here long after you and I (after having lived hopefully long and healthy lives) have both died. Speaking of dying, I hope Weinberg is resting in peace. He was wrong though. If you can determine what is good or bad, and act accordingly without religion, then you don't need religion for a good person to turn and commit a bad action.   Anyway, that's enough reddit for one day. Cheers.",Multipurpose_Bagel,2025-05-07T17:50:13,1

"As one of the people that was able to give input to those in crafting the bill to make sure that it covered smaller religions, including the Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons to make sure it covers the way they sweep child sexual abuse under the rug all using the same privileges the Catholic Church demands... üñï!!   Get your head out of one narrative and do some goddamn research about this issue outside of the Catholic church. Coming at me with caring about repeat offenders and not caring about childrenüñï.  At least I'm not part of any organized religion that continually demonstrates they care Fuck all about children. Anyone who continues to support them is culpable.
