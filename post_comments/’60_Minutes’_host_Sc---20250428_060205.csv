> Owens walked away following a $20 billion lawsuit   That's a pretty huge screw up. Maybe don't cost your company 20 BILLION if you want to avoid additional oversight from your parent company.,Critical_Concert_689,2025-04-28T09:23:13,39
"That edit 60 Minutes did with Kamala is absolutely wild. I can't believe they not only thought it was perfectly fine to do, but that they would also get away with it.  Insane times.",ObjectiveJackfruit35,2025-04-28T14:56:16,8
In other words: “we got caught manipulating interviews and that act could cost the company billions in both value and in credibility and now corporate is tightening their control over content because of our reckless ethics…”,smith288,2025-04-28T06:58:58,132
">“Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways, none of our stories have been blocked but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires,” he continued.  Honest? Life in the liberal bubble.",triggernaut,2025-04-28T06:03:22,140

Cracking down on fake news and slander causes casualties. Pelley couldn't abide by 60 Minutes becoming more accurate. It's still most likely just  window dressing until the Trump suit is settled.,social_dinosaur,2025-04-28T08:21:40,13

All of this could have been avoided if they were just politically neutral and not covering up Kamala's complete inability to speak properly. Fake news gonna fake.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-28T08:37:55,62

They think they're honest journalists? Hahahahaha. Look how they covered up Kamala's word salads and Biden's senility,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-28T08:34:19,34
They honestly hate Trump and everyone who doesn't throw a fit of rage at the mention of his name. Does that count?,Im_A_Real_Boy1,2025-04-28T06:43:31,56
