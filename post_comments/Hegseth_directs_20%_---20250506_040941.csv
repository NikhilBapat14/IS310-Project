How does one determine how many senior generals they need?  Genuine question.,thieh,2025-05-06T04:24:43,5
That’s not sus or anything.,Limberine,2025-05-06T04:23:22,6
Doesn't seem like a smart move. Cutting top leadership positions by 20% could lead to chaos and inefficiency. Who's gonna make the big decisions and keep everything running smoothly?,ProudSexyLady,2025-05-06T05:08:27,4
Same thing Nazi Germany did. Can’t have anyone in power that isn’t loyal to a Cheetos!,leaonas,2025-05-06T07:43:16,5
"Maybe we should start cutting 25% of Trump's cabinet and Trump's sycophants. The government is not a business. The government exists to run and maintain the country and it needs a sufficient number of people to do that efficiently and to keep planes from falling out of the sky, trains running properly, trucks running smoothly, nuclear arsenal protected, schools running properly etc. These morons, clowns and sycophants have zero experience in doing anything on a grand scale. If it hasn't scared you that Newark Airport is closing down because they don't have sufficient number of people and their system actually stopped working for almost 2 minutes leaving planes to fly blindly with no contact with the ground. That's Donald Trump's FAA. When is the public going to say enough and start shutting the country down and throwing these morons out?",TopEagle4012,2025-05-06T04:28:13,3
"Just to be clear, these cut positions are all going to be ones appointed by Biden, or Dems",Actual_Intercourse,2025-05-06T06:24:22,3

"They were saying how terrible this Russia issue was and how Joe Biden wasn't able to negotiate with Putin and that Trump would be able to get Putin Day One and now Trump is screaming ""STOP!"" ""STOP!"" to Putin and you have Signal Pete wanting to cut all of these top military leadership positions",postsshortcomments,2025-05-06T04:51:11,1

As others have said... cutting anyone who might be more loyal to the Constitution than El Trump? Gotta get your military leadership in line if your going to 'force' the issue of who is in charge....,WebRepulsive8329,2025-05-06T07:09:22,1
Hey a broken clock is right twice a day. I’m sure we can get by with fewer of these guys.,ThisCaiBot,2025-05-06T09:22:54,1
They count the number willing to deploy troops to round up and murder US citizens and that is the number they choose to keep.,Deinosoar,2025-05-06T05:45:37,26
"They’ll use the Silicon Valley method; Keep firing them until their division of the military falls over. Then reinstate, one by one, until it works again.  What’s not to like?",AINonsense,2025-05-06T05:13:08,6
"With one of the largest armies in the world and a clear delineation between an enlisted and officer corps, there is definitely a need for senior generals and their expertise gained through years of operational and organizational experience. No idea on how many are actually needed but you cut 20% of any organization, you will see the effects of it. Do that to a military with the top brass and there will be some major vacuums of knowledge and perspective that will take decades to replace.",Equivalent-Simple647,2025-05-06T07:01:15,2

Neither Trump not Hegseth wants military leadership that is substantially more qualified than they are. Career men and women with credentials from top colleges to all the military command courses won’t be the compliant stooges that this administration wants to rubber stamp their shenanigans. Posse Comitatus is taught and reinforced in military training.,RedditReader4031,2025-05-06T07:48:44,4
