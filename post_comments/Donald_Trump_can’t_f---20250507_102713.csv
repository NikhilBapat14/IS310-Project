He keeps lying about eggs being 50 cents and gas under $2 and no one is calling him out to his face on it. I'm sure he can just make up whatever he wants in regards to Medicaid cuts and continue to have zero push back.,CassadagaValley,2025-05-07T11:03:16,397

"**From James Downie, writer and editor for MSNBC Daily:**  President Donald Trump may still style himself as a D.C. outsider, but since his first campaign he has eagerly wielded the politician‚Äôs age-old clich√© about wanting to root out ‚Äúwaste, fraud and abuse‚Äù to evade tough questions about his budget proposals.  Unsurprisingly, Trump has inserted the ‚Äúwaste, fraud and abuse‚Äù phrase into the rhetoric around the most important bill of his second term so far: legislation that would extend 2017‚Äôs tax cuts and partially offset the lost revenue with at least $1.5 trillion in spending reductions. However, the ‚Äúbig, beautiful bill,‚Äù in Trump‚Äôs typically understated parlance, faces several big roadblocks, with House Republicans debating the cap on state and local taxes, cuts to food stamps and more.

He says the guy is MS-13, he falsely claims has the characters M S 1 3 are on the guy's knuckles, he justifies the guy being deported.  Then you'll get low information morons who will defend every word and claim it's not what he said or meant.  They say he was referring to the meaning of the tattoos, not the photoshopped M S 1 3.  They refuse to watch him literally get called out that those characters are photoshopped, and him doubled down on that specific point - the photoshopped characters, not the actual tattoos - and they look the other way and act like it's not what he literally was talking about, with no room for interpretation, for two fucking minutes in arguing.",DebentureThyme,2025-05-07T18:21:39,6
