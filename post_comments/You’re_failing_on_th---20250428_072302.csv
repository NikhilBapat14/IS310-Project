"“His net approval rating is minus 11 points, with Hispanics and the young souring on him most since his election victory.”  Hmm what could possibly be causing that swing?!",ahdidi413,2025-04-28T07:26:45,12

"He's failing on the economy? When they have the power to seize anybody including US citizens and throw you in a foreign prison without going to court,  maybe that's the thing you should worry about more than the cost of eggs going up. Just saying",TopEagle4012,2025-04-28T07:35:04,5
"I know this is an unreliable indicator, but I've observed that some homes in my area that have had Trump banners and signs up for a decade have recently taken them down. I think even some die-hard MAGAts are starting to see the light.",hinanska0211,2025-04-28T07:33:14,3
"He's approaching the potential ""Danger Zone"" of approval where vulnerable congresspeople will have a chance to realize they hitched their horses to a lead weight on a sinking ship.  Do I think anything will come of it? No they are all spineless and complicit. But it's at least a nice thought.",19chevycowboy74,2025-04-28T08:35:07,3

"Well, Americans failed on election day. We're getting the failure we deserve.",Dr_Hannibal_Lecter,2025-04-28T10:48:59,1
"Unpopular opinion: it’s too soon to tell whether he is failing, yes the stock market is suffering and inflation continues to hit groceries at the moment However assuming he is telling the truth and is coming to deals with other countries regarding tariffs, I think a rebound on the stock market will occur and groceries will get cheaper. He’s almost at just 4 months in his term, it seems silly to say he failed at the start line.. might as well ride it out and call him a failure at the 4 year mark, not 4 month..",ta-tums,2025-04-28T10:43:53,-6

>However assuming he is telling the truth  Don't do this. Nobody you know has ever lied as much as Trump does. You're better off to assume he's lying as a starting point.,Smaynard6000,2025-04-28T11:32:52,6
