"China’s “place-of-origin washing” isn’t outsmarting Trump’s tariffs—it’s an old trick. Rerouting goods through Malaysia or South Korea to dodge 145% U.S. levies is costly and risky, with only $21 million in fakes caught in Q1 2025, peanuts next to $439 billion in Chinese imports. U.S. customs are tightening rules, closing loopholes like de minimis. Tariffs are hurting China—export share to the U.S. dropped from 20% to 15% since 2017, and their trade surplus is shrinking. This is a desperate hustle, not a win. Xi’s bravado is just domestic flexing.",Manpig03,2025-05-05T11:57:04,-15

>  Tariffs are hurting China—export share to the U.S. dropped from 20% to 15% since 2017  Those numbers have dropped because China began its plan of divesting from the American market after Trump's first go round with tariffs.,biscuitarse,2025-05-05T12:50:49,6
[China lifted about a quarter of their tariffs](https://archive.ph/ai0Kp#selection-2541.0-2541.273)  > The notion that China’s exemptions largely mirror the US ones suggests this is more of a strategic move to match Washington’s actions rather than purely a goodwill gesture. It also points to Beijing’s priority of shielding its own economy from the fallout of the trade war.,biscuitarse,2025-05-05T12:39:18,15
