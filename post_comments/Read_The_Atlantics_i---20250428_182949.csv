"It seems pretty clear from that interview that trump completely believes all his own bullshit.   he lives in a parallel universe where what ever he thinks or says no matter how bizarre, far fetched or down right lies it is - is the best for trump and therefore the best for the country and by default, the gospel truth according to trump.",netsheriff,2025-04-28T19:49:57,8

"I don’t know… I think he has his weird patter, it sounds just like it did before, I’m not saying he doesn’t believe his own lies, I’m just saying his weird lazy word salad answers are really seem more like a (very successful) defensive strategy. No one can ever seems to actually nail him down on anything because they don’t know how to handle the long winded, often nonsensical, flash flood of lies. If you don’t believe me, take a look at his testimony in one of his many many depositions (I think there may have been some video depositions that you can find online). He knows he has to run out the clock, and his answers are just amazing (in that they convey neither truth nor meaning).",xyz_rick,2025-04-28T21:39:24,1
