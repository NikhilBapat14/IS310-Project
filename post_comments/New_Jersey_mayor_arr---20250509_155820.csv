">*The department said further that as a bus carrying detainees was entering, “a group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.”*   I don't believe this for one second, but if that's what happened, it's just a peaceful tour of a Federal building. That's what we've been told for the last four years.",ResponsibleSalad8059,2025-05-09T16:43:04,53
A mayor being arrested for trespassing in his own city? Are you kidding me? He literally owns a key to the city.,Thund3rbolt,2025-05-09T16:08:01,54
"> Witnesses said the arrest came after Baraka attempted to join a scheduled tour of the facility with three members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation, Reps. Robert Menendez, LaMonica McIver, and Bonnie Watson Coleman.  >When federal officials blocked his entry, a heated argument broke out, according to Viri Martinez, an activist with the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice. It continued even after Baraka returned to the public side of the gates.  >“There was yelling and pushing,” Martinez said. “Then the officers swarmed Baraka. They threw one of the organizers to the ground. They put Baraka in handcuffs and put him in an unmarked car.”",BukkitCrab,2025-05-09T15:59:40,22
"I'm also waiting for somebody to tell me they didn't even have the legal authority to do that. Ice can arrest anybody? They can arrest anybody just on the streets for something they say happened on their property sometime in the past?   Seems really bad, really really masked secret police simply doing whatever they want, already. Not next week or next month but today.",shoobe01,2025-05-09T19:33:11,9

"Tom Holman warned about exactly this kind of thing just last week, saying ""wait to see what's coming"". If anything, the fact that this was part of a protest plays into a ""you forced our hand!"" fascist playbook.    Remember AOC came out right after that statement saying she's not afraid, because they all know this is coming fast.

My thoughts too. How does immigration and custons enforcement have the authority to arrest a citizen and political leader? Also just what is going on in that facility that they didn't want powerful people to see?,FastidiousLizard261,2025-05-10T14:20:15,1
These people have been held without due process so the facility isn't even holding them legally. I don't see why we couldn't just attack this facility and rescue these kidnapped victims who are being human trafficked.,TheCommonGround1,2025-05-09T20:05:05,14
You miss the point. Precedent has been set.   Storming a government building is not a crime as per jan 6.  Therefore this is not a crime either. As much as you may want to bask in your hypocrisy know that there are always people that know.  They won’t say it to avoid dealing with you but make no mistake they see you clear as day.,Rafflesrpx,2025-05-09T20:13:34,9

"Seen some others insisting that their federal agents so can do anything they want about arresting but I definitely seen in the past stuff like how postal inspectors for Coast Guard enforcement agents or Forest Service enforcement rangers or so on cannot arrest people outside of their domain. They are law enforcement so can carry their guns and stuff, provide assistance and so on but I guess this is another that was just a handshake deal, a norm that we've just had to set aside and now any old fed can arrest anybody they want, anywhere?",shoobe01,2025-05-10T14:33:07,1
"I don't know. It's curious, maybe it's like you say and it was just tradition that kept everyone in their own area of influence. They will likely say that the mayor was just detained and not arrested officially. It's spooky to me bc either they are being told from higher ups to keep observers out or else they are doing things that are improper. It's likely the later.   Jails are hugely expensive to furnish and not at all straight forward fixtures, so much so that it's nearly impossible to retrofit an existing building for detention. So my guess would be dog kennels and waste buckets, and they are trying to hide it from any oversight. Or they don't want anyone to be able to ID the inmates or get an accurate count.  The New York cops have put people in temporary detention in whare houses before. No plumbing, concrete floor. They did it after some protest that happened. That's likely what is going on, they want to sneak out some of the over crowding, hide the code violations and keep anyone from being able to talk to the inmates at all.",FastidiousLizard261,2025-05-10T15:18:47,1
