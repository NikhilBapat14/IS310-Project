"The Senate has some kind of rule that a Senator who voted yay on a bill can't reintroduce it to floor. The Majority Leader will sometimes vote against their parties bill, if they know it's going to fail, so they can reintroduce it to the floor at a later date.  I'm not aware of the opposite happening. Maybe Schumer just didn't support the bill, but I couldn't tell you more without knowing which bill.",[deleted],2024-07-12T10:17:35,7
"In GA, when GOP wanted to refresh the gerrymander in the state they got dem minority leader of the state house, Stacey Abrams to help.  They got her on board by drawing safer seats for certain members of her caucus and she got her caucus to vote for it.  Not sure if this corrupt collusion is unconventional or not.  During the 2018 midterms, Mitch struck an agreement with dems in the senate to pause judicial confirmations if they batch confirmed for him so they could campaign without distractions.  Dems did their part and Mitch kept confirming anyway.    Under Obama, GOP senators would ask him to appoint someone of their choice.  He did so on a few ocassions, hoping they'd stop their obstruction.  Once such candidates went thru the whole process, all republican senators or all except the nominating senator voted the candidate down anyway.  The goal was to waste senate time since dems had a supermajority.  Under GWB, congress was passing a bill in regards to USPS.  GWB intervened near the end as he wanted to loot the funds which also crippled the USPS as it forced them to pre-fund pensions at a ridiculous schedule in advance.  It was right down to xmas break so leaders just got their caucus to vote for it so they could all go home.  That was only repealed recently.   The senate won't go on formal recess to stop recess appointments.  We saw this even when GOP had the senate and Trump was president.  They have someone to go in and bang the gavel to pretend it is in session even tho they really aren't.  Obama once litigated this and the supreme court rules that the senate is in recess if the senate says so.  Trump was furious when his own party did this to him as they wanted to stop him replacing everyone with loyalists that might otherwise be trash.    He sought to force congress to go on recess but found he didn't have the power in that situation as congress was otherwise in agreement.  If they disagree the president can step in.  Sometimes they use voice votes when they don't want to be on record for who voted for what and expedite things.  Rand Paul and Mike Lee have a tendency to halt those when it is spending related.  In the UK, during Brexit, a bunch of govt rebels actually joined the rest of parliament to take control of the house away from the govt to pass a bill that would give the entire house a bigger say on brexit terms.  That was a big crisis at the time.",captain-burrito,2024-07-17T12:58:23,1
