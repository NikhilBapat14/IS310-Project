"Fake news. He also knows how to ask for pronouns, call everything racist, and shriek.",Phenzo2198,2025-04-24T19:08:16,52
One of my old friends went to graphic design school in San Fransisco and spent about $100k on a bachelors and is in massive student loan debt. He now lives in Arizona and refuses to move to another state to make use of his degree. There isn't a large job market here in Arizona for graphics design. I know that story is comedy but it's loosely based on reality.,caffeinatedgoober,2025-04-24T18:12:47,13
"More hyperbolic non-sense from the Bee.    I'm sure he also knows ""from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free"".  Way to under dramatize their value to society.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-24T18:45:05,13

"Was just coming to say the same….this is satire, but sadly not far from reality. Especially for leftists.   They made the conscious choice to attend high-priced schools for their bachelors/masters/PhD, went consciously into massive debt, and planned what??…….that it would just go away magically?",ITrCool,2025-04-24T18:32:18,4
"Bless her heart, but my bestie and I met at our private university that was the same price, and she studied graphic design. She currently makes 65k. She also said that Biden was going to forgive her loans, so she wasn't going to pay them.",ManufacturerFine2454,2025-04-25T19:15:33,1
"They also have [advanced degrees in Beyonce](https://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article/Beyonce-inspired-class-at-UTSA-gets-9517958.php).  Kids are so lucky these days, I've missed so many opportunities from not having ""Beyonce expert"" on my resume.",ChristopherRoberto,2025-04-24T21:09:57,11
