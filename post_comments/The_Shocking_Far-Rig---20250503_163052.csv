Where are all those second amendment people always panicked about a authoritarian government.,sedatedlife,2025-05-03T16:51:32,155
Facial recognition in the hands of ideological extremists isn’t innovation but it’s infrastructure for oppression,fulltrendypro,2025-05-03T16:55:37,45
Of course they're using this for evil,TLakes,2025-05-03T16:44:51,26
"I am shocked! No, not shocked, the other thing.   All this tech has always been so default racist that I'm not the only one who assumed their corporate culture was explicitly racist, and they've made enough deals with governments, LEAs, that are just this side of redlining, and otherwise supporting racist policy.",shoobe01,2025-05-03T19:00:38,13

"It'd be nice if ICE used that fancy facial rec technology to not ""accidentally"" deport citizens and innocent people.",DeScepter,2025-05-03T17:29:57,10
"It isn’t shocking.  Stop pretending going back many decades to his slumlord days and casino days, he isn’t a wannabe slumlord, mob guy, convicted criminal, and now dictator fascist.",writingNICE,2025-05-03T20:45:21,8
"this shit is absolutely beyond wild.   I am going to call my local police and sheriff's departments tomorrow and ask their public information officers if they use this.   If they do, I am going to publicize it and see what happens.   This is fucked up as fuck.   And what the fuck happened to these motherless fucks, the techbros who think they're owed our humanity? They only have each other to talk to and they've invented some new bullshit religion where they're the gods.   I swear we're going to have to take society down to the studs to fix this.  Do masks thwart this technology? is that why these fuckers act like masks are the devil?",acostane,2025-05-03T21:07:03,8
"The projection from the right. Oh the protection. Everything they claimed the left was doing or would do as a slippery slope or hyperbole, they're doing. Nothing like a hyper-profiling tool to be used by a domestic terrorist organization who's core element is racism.",J-the-Kidder,2025-05-03T20:11:22,6
"Kind of sounds more like the plot behind Captain America: Winter Soldier. Which makes sense, because Trumpers act more like Hydra than Americans.",Veritable_Vox,2025-05-03T20:26:13,3
Nothing is shocking… the Republican Party wants to be Nazi Germany,astrozombie2012,2025-05-04T07:33:11,3
"Local law enforcement is using this as well across the US and the UK has already rolled out facial recognition as a reason to stop individuals who may have their faces covered. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to be policed by AI.",justtots,2025-05-04T09:00:29,3
'shocking' to no one.,hereforthepeens,2025-05-03T18:25:27,5

I wonder if Biden also supported this. Big mystery!,Svv33tPotat0,2025-05-03T21:26:47,-2
Won't be any problems if you haven't done anything illegal.,Top-Anybody1550,2025-05-03T17:57:54,-39
"Only a garbage rag like Mother Jones would call the people living and working in ultra-blue Northern California ""neoreactionaries"".  The author is delusional.",box-cable,2025-05-03T17:00:33,-46
"Conservatives won't give a shit until it affects them personally.  When they talk about rights, its about THEIR rights.  They couldn't care less about everyone's rights.  And if they do bear arms, it won't be because its for a greater good to resist tyranny. It will be to save themselves and their family and that's it.",A_RocketSurgeon,2025-05-03T17:01:29,108
They all joined ICE,ggaassghd677,2025-05-03T18:24:39,5
But without high-speed trains and a functioning government.,KeinFussbreit,2025-05-03T21:47:54,19
Trump is anything but Republican. It's legit insane.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T17:28:46,7
"Due process? Biden was a big supporter of that, unlike the current tyrant.",loglighterequipment,2025-05-06T18:53:57,1
I mean there are literally people in death camps that beg to differ. And American children with cancer who were thrown out of the country,FalstaffsGhost,2025-05-03T18:15:19,7

"They’ve already accidentally kidnapped and trafficked people that did nothing wrong and instead of correcting it they scorched earthed anyone who mentioned it and doubled down on “We didn’t make a mistake, and if we made a mistake it doesn’t matter”.",Vaeladar,2025-05-03T18:20:45,6
Aw precious baby!,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-03T18:10:21,4
I don't think you've read a single thing any of those in charge of these tech companies in those areas have written. It's disgusting dystopian garbage and so cartoonishly evil you'd think I'm making it up if I just said it. Curtis Yarvin type shit.,dymdymdymdym,2025-05-03T17:19:35,22
"Yeah, no.  The tech-broligarchs sure as shit aren't liberal.",KokrSoundMed,2025-05-03T17:09:21,17

"To be honest, the only times I've seen conservatives bear arms for a political statement is when they're threatening their fellow citizens. I think they'd just join up with the gestapo.",gentlemantroglodyte,2025-05-03T17:08:27,64
"They dont care about rights at all. Only privilege. They're 100% good with rolling back human and civil rights for a ""meritocracy"" they believe they'll be at the top of. Rights are for everyone and they REALLY dont like that.",Illustrious-Fig-2612,2025-05-03T19:12:32,12
Not true. Many of them things Trump does is affecting them personally. They just don't care because its hurting the libs and that makes all the pain and self sacrifice worth it.,Veritable_Vox,2025-05-03T20:23:00,2
"> And if they do bear arms, it won't be because its for a greater good to resist tyranny. It will be to save themselves and their family and that's it.  To be fair, this is everybody who gets a firearm for protection.",xibeno9261,2025-05-03T18:12:43,-2
Republicans no longer have any identity outside of Trump. They’ve sold any pretence at ideology for his path to power.,Vaeladar,2025-05-03T18:17:59,29
That's a bad lie. His tax reduction for wealthy people is the core of GOP politics. It's their only policy.,Ninevehenian,2025-05-04T06:15:29,3
Most likely we are being swarmed by trolls paid by the subjects of the article.,PatchyWhiskers,2025-05-03T18:15:14,6
They for sure would. Guaranteed safety for your family (as long as you stay in line) *and* you get to actively hunt and wipe out your enemies? Seems like a win-win to me.,BromoFom,2025-05-03T18:06:15,18
"They are authoritarian in nature, so yes, they would see a conservative dictatorship as being on their side. They like the hierarchy so long as they aren't the ones on the bottom.",LordSiravant,2025-05-03T19:00:19,13
Not sure what point you are trying to make. I agree with you.,A_RocketSurgeon,2025-05-03T21:32:43,1
It's very strange how far it's strayed from capitalism and small government,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T18:46:43,5
The core of his policy is tariffs and his trade war,AleroRatking,2025-05-04T06:55:05,1
"Then we need to put them on the bottom, and fast. And we need to keep them there.",RedditTrespasser,2025-05-03T19:01:29,7
I am saying it is unfair to criticize anyone who owns a firearm for not wanting to fight tyranny. People get firearms to protect themselves and their family. This is everybody. There is nothing to be ashamed about.,xibeno9261,2025-05-04T10:00:58,1
Is it? If you've been paying attention for a while this was a pretty clear direction.,Repulsive_Buy_6895,2025-05-03T18:57:36,8
Yes. Why are the tariffs needed?,Ninevehenian,2025-05-04T07:18:59,1
"They already think they are, which is why they're lashing out so violently and desperately.",LordSiravant,2025-05-06T21:43:06,1
"Again, I agree with you.  I'm not criticizing them at all for owning a gun for self protection.",A_RocketSurgeon,2025-05-04T15:43:29,1
It's strange. Doesn't mean we don't know why it happened  The back to back losses of moderate Republicans in Romney and McCain broke the party. They felt they couldn't win with conservative values so they instead  pivoted to whatever this is.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T19:06:40,3
Tariffs don't help the wealthy either. They will lose far more money,AleroRatking,2025-05-04T07:24:21,1
"It's strange because they're fighting to burn it all down and rule over the ashes. America doesn't have the cultural cohesion of china or russia to pull of an authoritarian state for very long, if at all.",Fr1toBand1to,2025-05-03T21:54:17,3
Some would rather win and lead to ruin then be losers.,AleroRatking,2025-05-03T22:01:58,2
