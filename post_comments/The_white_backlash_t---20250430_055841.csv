"I kind of miss the thoughtful, measured, careful answers President Obama gave to a free press.  Not at all like the years of insane bullshit this moronic idiot keeps spewing.",YallerDawg,2025-04-30T06:39:47,100
Exactly.  Reich-wing media lost their shit when Obama wore a tan suit and put fancy mustard on a burger.,Lost-Task-8691,2025-04-30T06:18:13,47

I‚Äôm sorry but the thought of Kamala Harris as US President will forever shake me to the core.  America had the opportunity to be led by perhaps the best president in American history but chose a lying narcissistic rapist instead.  What the actual fuck,LonelyGlass2002,2025-04-30T22:16:12,5

"Only people believing this isn't a racist country are 100% willfully ignorant for whatever agenda they think they need to be ignorant for.  This country does not exist in any capacity without overt, profound, and intrinsic racism.",PossiblyATurd,2025-04-30T08:36:29,8

"While I know there was racism in the way Obama was received in general, it‚Äôs not the reason why they didn‚Äôt accept his healthcare plan. They don‚Äôt want it no matter who is proposing it. It‚Äôs not like a white guy like Biden would suddenly get them to accept it.",Bakingsquared80,2025-04-30T06:37:15,3

I love that Obama was so amazing at hiding all the terrible shit he did. And how everyone just ate it up. I'm not a fan of Trump,Icy-Tap-4695,2025-05-01T17:46:38,1

"He's never sounded Presidential and I am confident when we look back at it in hindsight, he'll still be an idiot!

"Like most DNC/Dem statements, it‚Äôs not about actually doing anything, it‚Äôs about pointing out how you are morally/ethically/etc superior - which is a reason they lost in 2016 and 2024.  Dems are great at memes and talking, but boots on the ground or making a plans and enforcing them (like project 2025 - which I don‚Äôt like but was actually thought out on how to force through) they are not. There is no central party leadership, no shared values to game-plan and rally around, no power in the system with anyone under 70 years old.  Just status quo pushing everyone to agree to be ‚Äúcivil‚Äù and have ‚Äúdecorum‚Äù thinking that will bring people back",Lucky-old-boy,2025-04-30T10:46:10,-1

"That wasn't the point I was making.  But I do think that some people who would never accept something coming from Obama would happily accept the same coming from any generic white dude.  Because racism is still very much alive despite the election of a black president.  In some ways, it is very much alive BECAUSE of the election of a black president, sad as that is to say.",No-Button5149,2025-05-01T05:49:22,1
"Kamala Harris offered all of this. She expressed clear and decisive action, well thought out plans while trump offered ‚Äúconcepts‚Äù of plans along with false promises of ‚Äúin two weeks‚Ä¶‚Äù.
