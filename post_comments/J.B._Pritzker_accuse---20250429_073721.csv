"I do think there has been too much antisemitism that has been ignored lately. We are spoken over and [violence against us](https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-nyc-jews-targeted-in-hate-crimes-more-than-all-other-groups-combined-in-2024/amp/) is dismissed. But Trump doesn’t give a flying fuck about antisemitism. He is using us for his own ends, as world leaders have done for millennia. He isn’t fooling most Jews, but I do worry we are being blamed for his bullshit. A quick reminder [79% of jews voted for Harris.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/79-of-us-jews-voted-for-harris-according-to-largest-preliminary-exit-poll/amp/)",Bakingsquared80,2025-04-29T07:40:29,26

"Trump is utilizing antisemitism as a tool.  Antisemitism functions best when Jewish people are perceived to have increased power (regardless of reality), and when Jewish people can be used as scapegoats to insolate those in power from consequences.  What Trump appears to be doing is simply holding Jews up as an excuse for actions he is taking that the vast vast majority of American Jews are adamantly against, with the aim that enough members of the opposing gentile public will blame ~the Jews~ for his actions and take enough of their anger out on Jewish people (who largely agree with these folks about most everything) that they lose sight of the actual fascist regime.   It is a move that appears designed to fracture and divide his opposition, to foster hate and - as hate always does - weaken us, and sadly it does seem to be working.",hikingdyke,2025-04-29T09:48:44,14
