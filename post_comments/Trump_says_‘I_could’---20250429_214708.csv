I guarantee, if we had cameras on you almost 24/7 we would have ammunition to accuse you of mental illness. It's just the nature of being human.

The same people that claim Biden was ""mentally gone"" also claim he was genius mastermind manipulator trying to get Trump on any and everything and screwing the Democrats party.
