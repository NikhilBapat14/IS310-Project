It’s a cult.  That isn’t just an insult either.  That’s factual.  You take a look at every single psychological marker from cults throughout history and this MAGA movement hits every last one of them.,Popculturemofo,2025-04-27T16:53:48,35
"In the article he claims there's an actual ideology forming but I disagree. MAGA is all about what's best for Donald. There is no overarching ideology that is guiding this movement, on that front is a patchwork of rightwing groups with different priorities and views.",alien88,2025-04-27T16:58:43,18
Any media outlet that calls Luntz “America’s top pollster” is trash and a joke.,RamonaQ-JunieB,2025-04-27T17:30:08,16

"The big takeaway here is that these people in this focus group are desperate losers. And I don’t mean that in a nasty or insulting way… it’s just what they are. They are not winning. They don’t have a good life. They don’t have anything going for them. They don’t have a bright future. It’s, actually, very dim.   They are willing to gamble on any kind of “change” because they know their lot in life is stuck where it is absent really hard work/study/skill that they don’t have any plan for or opportunity for.   So they are at the last chance saloon happy to risk it all.   But here’s the, actual, story:  This “change” they’ve gambled on will make every aspect of their life demonstrably worse. The opportunity to better their lives goes from a remote chance to a zero chance.   What’s about to happen to them is all the things they are concerned about: access to healthcare, access to goods, access to a more prosperous life… the Trump administration is throwing the switch in the wrong direction on all of these for these people.  Their hospitals will close, grants for higher education will disappear, cheap financing for higher education will disappear, their dollars will be worth less. Goods they used to be able to afford/have will no longer be possible for them.   They will be sicker, poorer, and more hopeless than ever.   Change can be “New Deal” kind of change… that makes their lives better… or it can also be Hooverville kind of change that makes them yearn for the before times.   They are getting Hooverville policies. That’s the reality — and that’s the other half of this equation Lutz is scribbling on the chalkboard.   We’ve got all these losers. They’re pissed at everyone and everything. They voted for, and will get, “change.” But the “change” is from “bad to worse.”  That’s where this is headed. So then what? Then what do these focus group people do? Where do they go then?  They won’t be getting by. They’ll be figuratively starving and desperate…   They don’t respect authority, they don’t believe in law and order. They’ve been led to believe that this is all someone else’s fault. (That it’s the left’s fault).   I’d like to see Lutz ask these people this question: “if your gamble on Trump loses… if his policies leave you a bigger loser than you’ve ever been before… who are you going to blame? Who are you going to be angry at?”   Some will say: “well, obviously, I’ll blame Trump.” And I think it’s pretty darn important for them to think this through now before the propaganda hits.. and to get them on the record.   The alternative is they will blame the “democrat party” as they’ve been primed to call it. They’ve been primed to dehumanize Democratic voters… and the alternative is violence.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-27T17:59:01,9
The commonality of the full focus group interview was a perception that they've already seen the results of their grievance based issues.  Issues solved at the cost of no pain.,nerphurp,2025-04-27T17:14:37,8
There’s this weird element with Trump where a lot of people who aren’t on the left think he’s terrible but like his straightforward corruption because it gives their hatred of the system more reason.,FawningDeer37,2025-04-27T16:50:52,5
"Culture war propaganda. That explains all of it.  The magician's trick to distract you from real issues with the bullshit that doesn't affect you.   The vast overwhelming number of Americans will never ever have it any affect on their personal life from a transgendered athlete, but almost certainly will deal with social security issues. But I'm going to bet newsmax, Fox News, Breitbart, and all of the other right-wing ""news"" sources have spent more time on transgender athletes than the fact that Doge is disassembling the social security administration.   The Bill of goods sold by the right wing propaganda media for decades now has steered the boat,  whether it's a stay at home mom in Ohio terrified of Iraq getting yellow cake uranium, or a plumber in Iowa worried about drag queen reading hour, the right wins culture wars by fighting easily burnable strawman as a distraction while picking the pocket of the American people.  And I don't think the majority of people that believe this are really that dumb. They are just so steeped in the propaganda, that they can't really extract themselves from it. They just go deeper and deeper down the hole believing that the world is going to end if a 14-year-old kid gets gender affirming care, because they have been told over and over and over and over and over and over and over that it's wrong and it's evil.",thepartypantser,2025-04-27T18:23:26,3

“Top pollster” nope.,Luke_Cocksucker,2025-04-27T18:35:06,1
"So they want change and don't even know how to go about it,.praising the donald idiot. While everybody else hears do this or do that or wait,  Man how can you get more wanting and not get what you want. Maybe if they moved on with their own lives. Maybe even joined something real. What is this kids or a mixture of adults not grown. And their the only ones?",No_Interview4381,2025-04-27T19:55:01,1
"Completely agree. That was wishful thinking on his part. There is no ideology, only the arbitrary scatterbrained desires of the cult leader. Whatever THAT produces? You support that.",-Gramsci-,2025-04-27T17:35:35,5
"And a large number of, as dumb as dog shit, people that seem willing to blindly agree with what ever is said.  This is regardless of if it goes against their own best interests.",netsheriff,2025-04-27T18:19:06,4
"I appreciate your comment, especially the part about feeling respected again by the world. I don't think this is true at all, but it's what my Maga family members say. I think that it all will cost them a lot eventually. My Maga sister will probably lose her job if they cut spending on healthcare. I think that in the long run they're going to hurt a lot from this, but we all will. ",oddlyluminous,2025-04-27T17:48:20,3

Thank you for sharing. I feel like I don't live in the same reality as these voters. If you like this kind of thing I highly recommend The Focus Group podcast from The Bulwark with Sarah Longwell.  It echos many similar sentiments. ,oddlyluminous,2025-04-27T18:21:53,2
