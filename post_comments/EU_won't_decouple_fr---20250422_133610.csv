"Trump has won another major foreign policy victory for China. He has not just turned the USA into an unreliable trade partner, but also into an immediate threat to our security and our democracy. This is the result.   His ""strategy"" is pointless. He can probably destroy what is left of the ties between the USA and its former allies, but he won't get anything out of that. All it will ever do is help the USA's enemies.",barryvm,2025-04-22T13:43:36,25
"US Pain, China gain. The US is having unserious, insincere clowns deal with a serious nation, with a serious bureaucracy that can easily out maneuver US incompetence. Nice job building a trade wall to compete with intense innovation and only offering half-baked draconian ideas of MIUSA shit like ""bringing back coal power"". Sure, threaten every nation on the planet, that'll help us fight Chinese influence. Sure, push nations into viewing DJT as even more unstable and unreliable than originally thought, that'll show China. Whether you think Trump is smart or not isn't the point, the rest of the world doesn't trust him. It's not even solely just stupidity, but boy does it feel like it.",thirdeyevalhalla,2025-04-22T14:04:21,9
"It's looking increasingly likely that the EU and China have both concluded that Trump isn't a threat, but an opportunity. If the EU and China can work out how to co-operate, they can carve up global trade between them. Pull in Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Latin America, and you've got a full world of trade, except for the US. This is a chance for everyone else to cut the US out of the world economy and replace it with a duopoly; the US can just wither on the vine. It may take a couple of decades, but this could be the beginning of the end for the US as a first-tier economic power.",TelescopiumHerscheli,2025-04-22T13:46:43,16

"The EU/US relationship is far more valuable overall than the EU/China relationship, so under normal circumstances, the decision would’ve been easy. In an economic fight between the US and China, the EU would generally lean toward giving the US preferential treatment.  The EU runs a €198.2 billion trade surplus with the US (as of 2024), compared to a €304.5 billion deficit with China. Historically, the US-EU trade relationship has fueled growth on both sides, helping the EU economy flourish.  But there's a slight problem: the EU needs trade with China... and for the same reason we need it: there's no quick or easy replacement for the supply chains that come from China. Stuff like components, materials, consumer goods - things you cannot easily replace locally.  ...And when US policy turns erratic or outright adversarial, that dependence becomes non-negotiable.  Worse yet, the EU's strong trade surplus with the US is now effectively a wildcard. All it takes is one bad day and the whims of the guy at the helm and tariffs are back. They could cut off China, make a show of loyalty, and then get burned anyway because Mr. Sundowning was in a bad mood because of something ""AlphaMale42069"" said on Twitter about how ""weak"" he was.  What I see happening: they'll do what they can to appease the US just enough to buy time while building trade bridges elsewhere... likely with the same countries the US has alienated.",absentmindedjwc,2025-04-22T21:03:09,2

The next president is screwed.   We’re screwed now.  But the next president is going to be one term because people are going to think they can’t get anything done because of how screwed up Trump made everything.,User-Name-8675309,2025-04-22T14:06:00,13
"Not really. Trump is a threat but he is also untrustworthy. Fulfilling his demands doesn't guarantee anything and he is willing to break deals on a whim. China just seems to be a lesser evil, which is pretty terrifying.",Bajanek,2025-04-22T14:29:16,6
Carve up?  Trump has already done that. It’s just a matter of picking up the pieces.  We will be remembered through history as a winner who felt cheated and left the competition.,mole_that_got_whackd,2025-04-22T14:09:11,2
"Nah, it would be MUCH better for Europe to have a reliable ally in USA. The current American administration is definitely a thread to stability and world peace. But it is what it is and we have to make the best of it.",carcatta,2025-04-22T14:03:11,-1
"Also: stop selling stuff to us or we will raise tariffs to make you stop selling your stuff to us.  As you say: the greatest deal maker. Can't even make a threat without getting stuck in his own ""logic"". Presumably you need to be aware that other people have agency and that the world doesn't exist just for you to be able to grasp the basics of threatening people into doing what you want.",barryvm,2025-04-22T13:58:18,8
