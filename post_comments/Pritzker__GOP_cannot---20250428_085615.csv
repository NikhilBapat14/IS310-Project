 Should already be that way.       Republicans in Congress are the only people who can currently rein in Trump.  Make them do their jobs. Give them no peace.,Mattyboy064,2025-04-28T13:39:22,2

"The ""do nothing dems"" is bullshit. The voters gave MAGA all the power. It's up the people to show their displeasure.  People like AOC and Bernie are giving people a forum to air their grievances. It's not their fault this administration is behaving like a dictatorship and not listening.  The only thing left is for citizens to start suing the government. Protests are not doing anything.",Captcha_Imagination,2025-04-28T11:58:17,4
Compare this to the likes of Slotkin and Newsom - let's get the GOP a good night's rest so we can sit down and understand their needs.  Pritzker knows how to read the room.  And this is the path to dealing with an authoritarian regime.  History is our guide.  Appeasement doesn't work.,CrimsonFeetofKali,2025-04-29T08:40:28,1

"AoC. Bernie. A couple others here and there. No concrete, uniform, resistance. Now is the time for anyone who loves America and hates fascism to stand together and shout ""no"" at every opportunity. We're at war and the Democratic leadership needs to get on board with that realization before they start getting arrested too.",YakiVegas,2025-04-28T14:27:59,15
sucking off the billionaires. Pritz doesn’t have to bc he’s already part of the club! thats the only reason he doesn’t feel the need to grovel.,joaquinsolo,2025-04-28T09:01:40,28

"He's all talk to get reelected, then goes back on what he says. Typical politician. He's very soft on crime. We do not need him running more than Illinois!",NoReallyLetsBeFriend,2025-04-29T06:43:47,1

We need to get progressive candidates in. These moderates are failing us.  I'm doing what I can and ready to do more.,reesemulligan,2025-04-28T14:33:41,7
"Ironically what Trump supporters think Trump is, an insider advocating for them.  And they'll spit in Pritzker's face too.",PharmyC,2025-04-28T09:08:29,23
