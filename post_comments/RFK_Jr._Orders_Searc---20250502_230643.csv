Stupid is as stupid does.,Taint_Liquor,2025-05-02T23:08:38,86
"First of all, to the skeptics out there:  - The debunked claim that vaccines cause autism originated from a small study back in 1998 authored by the infamous Andrew Wakefield. The study was later found to be inherently flawed and fraudulent, and was not only retracted, but repudiated by the scientific community.  - Wakefield had his medical license revoked for serious professional misconduct and he's been ostracized by medical experts.  - Since then, many large scale, rigorous studies have established no link between vaccines and autism.   - Wakefield's study included only 12 children. This kind of sample size is unprecedentedly small—meaningless in fact—and far too small to draw any reliable conclusions from.  - Wakefield was also criticized for a lack of a control group in his study, which is an essential part of any meaningful experimental study.  - He also altered patients medical histories to support his claims, he had conflicts of interest and his study involved the unethical treatment of children.  - Dozens of large scale studies involving literally millions of children have since been conducted, all of them consistently pointing to the same conclusions—that vaccines do not cause autism.  - Thimerosal—a mercury based preservative previously  used more commonly in some vaccines—was also the target of anti-vax claims which have since been debunked.  - Extensive research has shown that there is no link between Thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism, while research has also shown that even low doses of the preservative in vaccines do not cause any harm other than minor reactions like redness/swelling at the site of injection.  - And despite this research, Thimerosal was still removed from most childhood vaccines anyways as a precautionary measure.  I feel compelled to add to this a short list of some of the dangerous and unfounded claims Kennedy has made over the years.   But first, I've heard a few people argue that some of the criticisms levied against RFK Jr. are unwarranted or unfair because of his record as an environmental lawyer. In other cases, some people try to downplay his insanity, arguing that his words are taken out of context.  When it comes to the former, RFK Jr. has since lost all credibility due to the erratic, harmful and baseless claims he's made related to vaccines and public health  Not to mention his adherence to Trump and a MAGA agenda that is eroding the independence of public health related agencies, that's stripping knowledgeable civil servants of their protections, that's maligning medical professionals and propping up discredited ""health experts"", that's defunding scientific and medical research, and all while his department is taking steps to dismantle agencies and organizations that are responsible for protecting the environment and maintaining public health and safety.  Id also be remiss if I didn't mention his founding of The Children's Health Defense, an anti-vax non profit that played a significant role in the measles outbreak in Samoa that claimed the lives of dozens of children.  I should also mention his recent trip to the Southwest, which is currently at the center of a record measles outbreak, where he praised a ""healer"" who was administering alternative treatments to unvaccinated children and adults while infected with the measles himself.  And keep in mind, as it currently stands, there are over 900 reported cases of measles in the US as part of a historic outbreak that's spread over 29 states, with a majority of the cases in Texas. There have been three confirmed deaths so far, one adult, two children, ***all of them unvaccinated.***  Now when it comes to the argument that Kennedy really isn't as batshit as the media makes him out to be, here are just some recent examples of his ignorant and dangerous remarks:  > Kennedy said, 'I probably did say, Lyme disease is ""highly likely a militarily engineered bioweapon""'  > Kennedy has repeatedly suggested environmental toxins, including those in drinking water, are linked to gender identity in children. These claims are unfounded.  > He has reiterated a thoroughly debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism  > Kennedy has also referred to the Covid vaccine as “the deadliest vaccine ever made,” despite data showing it’s overwhelmingly safe.  > At an event last year, Kennedy promoted a racist and antisemitic theory that Covid “ethnically targeted” white and Black people but not Ashkenazi Jews or Chinese people.  > Kennedy has amplified baseless claims suggesting a link between antidepressants like Prozac and school shootings. “Prior to the introduction of Prozac, we had almost none of these events,” he told billionaire Elon Musk last year. But research shows that most school shooters were not previously treated with psychotropic medications — and even when they were, there was no association between those drugs and the shootings.  > He has long peddled AIDS denialism conspiracy theories, alleging that HIV does not cause AIDS and questioning the “theology that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS.”  > He lamented that “any questioning of the orthodoxy that HIV is the sole cause of AIDS remains an unforgivable — even dangerous — heresy among our reigning medical cartel and its media allies”   > Kennedy’s book frequently cites discredited work of Peter Duesberg, a prominent AIDS denialist. “I haven’t found any evidence that HIV ever actually kills a T-cell.”  > He argued vaccines make people “lose IQ” and said the vaccine “dominant narrative” has “little proof.”  > Kennedy claimed vaccinologists add toxins to vaccines to amplify immune response. “They literally went on a search throughout the world looking for the most toxic things that they could find in order to add them to the vaccine,”  > Kennedy claimed that nobody knows the risk for any currently scheduled vaccines and that “nobody can say with any scientific certainty that [the polio] vaccine is averting more injuries than death than it’s causing.”  > [He] claimed flu and polio vaccines increase susceptibility to future flu strains and polio cases.  > Kennedy has also claimed that ""there is zero evidence that the flu shot prevents any hospitalization or any deaths... The flu shot transmits the flu. In fact, if you get the flu shot, you're six times more likely to give somebody else the flu, than if you didn't get the flu shot.""  > ""Since we started mandating the flu shot for elderly people[...] their life expectancy has dramatically gone down.""  > ...Speaking on “Health Freedom for Humanity,” a podcast run by a nonprofit advocating for medical freedom, Kennedy encouraged people to join him in telling strangers not to vaccinate their babies  > In July 2023, the same month he testified at the House hearing, Kennedy said in a podcast interview that “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective.”  > He also accused Fauci of destroying repurposed medications like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that also “would’ve obliterated Covid.”  Kennedy is an obvious kook who should have been disqualified from any position in government, let alone a position that oversees all public health related agencies.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-05-03T00:23:11,79
