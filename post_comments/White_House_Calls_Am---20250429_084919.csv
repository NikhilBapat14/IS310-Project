"It would appear that the MAGA Moron assumed that all consumers and vendors would again be as stupid as the pre-election dupes whom he convinced that other countries would pay the tariffs.

I suppose the line item for taxes when calculating the subtotal and total for an invoice is also considered hostile? Because a tariff is just another tax. ,JennJayBee,2025-04-29T10:20:43,1
