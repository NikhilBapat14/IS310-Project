Definitely worth the expense: confiscated “some minor narcotics seizures and nearly 300 rounds of 9 mm ammunition as well as close to 40 rounds of 12-gauge ammunition.”,auddii04,2025-05-10T07:44:44,14

"Serious question to Americans Redditors - You are on US soil, going about your business, heading to the border. You haven't hit the border yet or even the lineup for it. Don't you guys have laws against illegal search and seizure? A policeman can't pull you over for shits and giggles and demand to search your car. He can ask, you can say no and the best they can do is hope a drug dog hits on a roach you forgot about that's under your seat. Why is US Border protection allowed to do it?  I admit I don't know the rules but I'm pretty sure I'd be pissed if Canadian border guards stopped me outside the confines of the US border crossing and demanded to look in my car. I'm fairly confident I'd be within my rights to tell him suck my arse. Again, maybe I'm a babe in the woods with all this shit.",theflower10,2025-05-10T07:58:15,8
>Saunders said what officers found at the Peace Arch and Blaine border crossing was “hardly anything.”  What a waste of resources.  So much for their touting of 'efficiency'.,nwgdad,2025-05-10T08:33:14,8

"Sure go back to normal if you want, but for many of us the damage is done and we’re not coming down anytime soon (or ever again).   Hopefully building all those manufacturing facilities will replace the economic activity this behavior cost you.",Kind-Spinach-1809,2025-05-10T12:49:28,1

"If you live within 100 miles of a border, you are subject to COB or ICE jurisdiction. It is common in the southern US for there to be checkpoints on the roads where they ask you your citizenship.",AreaManThinks,2025-05-10T08:05:42,13

"It’s fun here, legally you are allowed to deny consent for a search, but some good ol’ boys in blue will use you saying no as probable cause that you’re hiding something.   Best case scenario you sit on the side of the road for an hour waiting for the dog, dog finds nothing you get a bogus ticket for something anyways and be on your way.   Cops don’t care about rights, I learned that at a very young age and I’m a white American",PorQuePanckes,2025-05-10T13:39:11,1
"It's funny if you think we're actually going to build manufacturing facilities to replace what we traded with people. If you want to build x, it takes about 5 years to build a factory, train everyone and staff it   However, to build x, you also need y and z , and do would have to build a factory for that.   However, all of these factories require steel, which we put a tariff on. Additionally, the sale of US steel had been disapproved, and it will likely close soon.   But don't worry, we're doing great.",auddii04,2025-05-10T13:28:33,1
