They aren't trying to help the 99% of Americans who make up the country, they are only trying to help the other 1%.  As Republicans always do.  They finally have the power to do it, so they're doing it.  They want the US dollar to collapse (billionaires sell a lot more shit with a lower $USD).    Basically, they want their cake - and eat it too.  They want a low $USD - while, at the same time, having the $USD be the world's reserve currency.  They want all the benefits of being a reserve currency, with none of the negatives.  So, they are trying to bully and extort everyone else to just, please, take all the negatives yourselves!  Right now, they're bullying the Fed, trying to get them to drop interest rates - to help billionaires.  While, at the same time, trying to crater the $USD, to help billionaires - and lowering taxes, to help billionaires.  Even though they can't really do all of these things at the same time.  This will, of course, lead to a GIGANTIC drop in the living-standards of everyday Americans.  Everyone in the country, who isn't worth at least 8 figures, will get considerably poorer.
