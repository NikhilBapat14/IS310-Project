impeach Alito and Thomas,BoysenberryGullible8,2025-04-21T09:01:07,34
Alito and Thomas are begging to be impeached. 7-2 is a clear line in the sand for this court.,malachiconstant76,2025-04-21T09:18:53,32
Ambassadors and diplomats during the Holocaust worked their fingers to the bone at all hours signing visas to save victims from the concentration camps and this m’fer would be worried about getting his beauty sleep  https://www.holocaustrescue.org/diplomats-recognized-by-yad-vashem,ominous_squirrel,2025-04-21T08:56:43,26

It's imperative that the USA and SCOTUS stand up to Trump.  Justice Alitos dissenting opinion is outrageous IMO.,Walk1000Miles,2025-04-21T09:14:28,16
Irony. The most corrupt judge in the country calling something “legally questionable”,johnnyhandbags,2025-04-21T10:35:24,13
"I for one am very happy to know that they outright insulted him because they knew that he was a regressive asshole who only knew how to do the same thing over and over again, never on the side of justice",nutslichi,2025-04-21T09:17:53,11

Alito is the one who's 'legally questionable'. Thomas too.,Mysterious_Eye6989,2025-04-21T10:07:39,6
"I don't give a fig what that purchased judge thinks. Oh and I care even less about what Thomas thinks. To me they need to go they have been purchased, they have been compromised, and both of their wives are complicit as well.  Show them the way out.",Clean_Lettuce9321,2025-04-21T12:07:44,6
Just like Islam did in the middle east..... Christian sharia here we come,dragonfliesvenus,2025-04-21T09:06:04,6
Just to get this right: He undermines his OWN job and the constitution? By questioning the legality of the Supreme Court he commits treason and he attacks himself too. Without legitimacy the Supreme Court is gone and Alito with it. That dude is dumber than a sack of bricks.,Morgentau7,2025-04-21T16:13:13,2
"Why is Reddit being spammed with his dissenting opinion?    The majority opinion was 7-2.  The underlying issue wasn’t even close - Trump is shitting on the constitution, and SCOTUS called him on it. So what if Alito also shits of the constitution. We’ve known that for years.  It’s not news.",guttanzer,2025-04-21T11:33:43,3
NEITHER one should have been appointed in the first place. Those two aren't fit to rule a traffic court,LivingIndependence,2025-04-21T15:41:14,8
"It wouldn't surprise me in the least if him and Thomas weren't being comped regularly by Musk for their rulings. Musk can afford to keep them on his payroll, at least until this national nightmare ever ends anyway ",LivingIndependence,2025-04-21T15:45:14,1
