A hearing to talk about a trial date a year after the charges. Is that what the 6th amendment means by a right to a speedy trial?,pcm2a,2025-04-26T14:59:40,263
Swore I saw a video of him shooting the CEO.,BercCoffee,2025-04-26T13:16:50,92
"I'm always reluctant to judge a trial from the outside, but my intuition on this one is that the evidence seems slim, aspects of the procedure or events leading up to the arrest look dubious, and if I had to bet on it, I'd put my money on him not being the same man who killed the CEO.  Call me a conspiracy theorist but I wonder if the powers-that-be just picked someone (a person they thought they could get away with targeting, or perhaps that they were comfortable targeting for other reasons) to accuse just to maintain some sort of appearance of law-and-order, fearing that not doing so might either invite copycat killings, or just give the killer's inherent critique of the system, in his act, too much credibility.  Take that with a grain of salt. I'm incredibly biased against the healthcare system in the US so I might be cynical to the point of irrationality.  Let's let due process play out. I trust the jury trial system more than I trust myself to judge from the outside.",cazort2,2025-04-26T13:45:37,46
I think he is guilty and so is Letitia James.,Whole-Essay640,2025-04-27T08:30:59,1
And most of Reddit continues to worship the spoiled rich frat bro murderer…,[deleted],2025-04-26T16:39:58,14
"Clearly guilty, he deserves a trial as everyone does, but the evidence is insurmountable.  Ridiculous how so many people worship this murderous trash because they feel he murdered the “right” person.",SetOk6462,2025-04-26T17:41:00,2
He is literally playing a game to get jury nullification; there is literally no one on the planet believes he is innocent — even his supporters— knows he killed the man in a premeditated fashion.,Racheakt,2025-04-26T22:56:21,0
Wait until he finds out it's all on video.,Key-Monk6159,2025-04-26T19:28:52,1
"At the end of the day, the hit looked more professional and to think he would just leave everything together and ""hide it"" so it was easy to find... makes me wonder.",mixer2017,2025-04-27T07:14:09,-2
"You have a right to a speedy trial, but if your defense attorney wants to delay you can delay it within reason. That’s a common tactic as the more it fades from public memory the better the chances of getting a sympathetic jury.",trs21219,2025-04-26T15:28:06,260
"Did you tho? What video did you watch? Because, it wasn't the video everyone else in the world saw.",Special_Sun_4420,2025-04-26T21:25:58,85
"Funny enough there is very little connecting this guy to that guy  The evidence is surprisingly weak, It's going to be very interesting and they are not hesitating to take it to trial.  If ""Reasonable Doubt"" is truly exercised, he will walk.",Baptism-Of-Fire,2025-04-26T13:31:48,327
"Honestly that video doesn’t show his face, and the alleged photo of him in a hostel or whatever literally looks nothing like him.  And they didn’t find the gun when they arrested him, they allegedly took his bag, then took him to the station, then voila, the murder weapon appeared.  Sus. As. Fuck.",Piss_in_my_cunt,2025-04-27T08:25:04,22
"I think this guy was a fall guy or he did it. There's a preponderance of evidence linking him to it. The bag with the manifesto, murder weapon, fake id, etc. His fingerprints and DNA found near the scene of a protein bar and water bottle placing him at the scene at the time of the crime. And of course the video of him doing it  That being said, I found it suspicious he was identified at a McDonald's a whole state over carrying all this evidence on him. So maybe a patsy for the real killer.",arbiter_0115,2025-04-26T18:49:40,21

Your intuition is very obviously wrong.,Hrendo,2025-04-26T21:45:45,-10
"And yet those same people oppose the death penalty for the worst murderers, rapists, and serial killers.",Swiftbow1,2025-04-26T19:55:15,11
"And he’s cute…\*swoon\* I want him to get a fair trial, but libs and their love for this guy is revolting.",Right_Independent_71,2025-04-27T06:04:00,5
"Man there’s a substantial number of people who, independent of support or condemnation, don’t think that’s him in the video. They didn’t even find the gun when they got him! They took his bag and it appeared later.",Piss_in_my_cunt,2025-04-27T08:27:05,3
"Thanks that makes sense. It also makes sense if you're out on bail, and pretty sure this is the end, to delay as many years as possible.",pcm2a,2025-04-26T15:37:35,56
"I just want to add that I see so many ppl on reddit on any trial thread say ""are you fucking serious it's so obvious they're guilty that they had the audacity to plead not guilty!!!!"". Yes no matter what it is I did and how obvious my crime is I'm always going to plead not guilty. It buys you time for your lawyer to work things out. If you plead guilty you're fucked.",xxjrxx93,2025-04-26T21:50:17,31
You don’t wanna see it. Just like all the millennial white women that think he’s hot. Crazy town.,BercCoffee,2025-04-27T14:22:58,0
"Considering the gun he was caught with is a match to shell casings at the scene, his fingerprints were matched to a protein bar and water bottle nearby that someone looking exactly like the shooter purchased, he was carrying a fake ID that was used to book a room in NYC, he was carrying a notebook in which he'd expressed hostility towards the healthcare industry and of course the video that shows him quite clearly shooting the guy.  I'd say the defence faces quite the uphill battle to prove it wasn't him.",Merax75,2025-04-26T14:27:03,247
"I disagree, I’ve watched the case from the get go and the evidence stacks up against him very strongly.",cliffotn,2025-04-26T14:19:40,82
Doesn't matter. He's going to get the death penalty whether he's the right guy or not. The elites that fund the uniparty can't have peasants thinking they could actually rise up.,GeorgeWashingfun,2025-04-26T14:55:13,21

How do you match a gun to shell casings?,ColumbusJewBlackets,2025-04-26T21:19:59,30

He should get the death penalty.,UltraAirWolf,2025-04-27T08:51:55,3
"""Matching"" a casing boils down to putting two pictures next to each other and convincing a jury they're the same thing.  Microstamping (gun barrel ""fingerprints"") isn't real, but it is feasible to match a casing to a specific firearm depending on whether there is unique enough damage or wear to the chamber walls and breach face to differentiate it from another given Glock or whatever.  Efforts to build a scannable computer database of shell casings have generally failed due to unreliability and expense, but if you have a given gun in your hand and wish to compare it to a recovered shell casing, it's very possible to do so. Or, at least, convince a jury you did so.  Chris Bartocci on Youtube used to be in this line of work and talks about it occasionally.",Special_Sun_4420,2025-04-26T21:28:08,25
So in other words it’s horse crap,ColumbusJewBlackets,2025-04-26T21:32:58,68
"Pretty much. I'm just giving information about something I've read about. Like a lot of things things in court, it doesn't really matter how accurate or reliable something is. Functionally, all that matters is if you can convince a judge that it's evidence and convince a jury that it's trustworthy. Read into how polygraphs work for another example of something like this.",Special_Sun_4420,2025-04-27T14:44:56,6
