"Never thought I'd see justification for random acts of vandalization of private property by any major political party.  If you are a Democrat and were on the fence about them after the debacle in the fall this needs to get you off it.  Don't need to go red (God forbid), just don't support these chumps any longer.  This is insanity.",Thats_Dr_Anthrope_2U,2025-04-18T19:25:06,30
"Dylan Bryan Adams, a 33-year-old fiscal policy analyst for the North Star State, was arrested on suspicion of keying multiple Teslas in Minneapolis while out walking his dog in an act of destruction caught on vehicle surveillance, according to a Minnesota-based crime watch account.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-18T23:52:46,7

"I'm sure there's some lurkers here so I'll probably try to keep this brief.  Not only is this dumb because you shouldn't be damaging other people's personal property, but this person is allegedly opening up a can of worms for Governor Walz because he'll no doubt bare some of the outrage if the accusations are proven to be true.  You can't think about what feels ""right"" or ""fair"" when you work in what amounts to a PR role that requires you limit the possibility of damage to your boss's reputation. Your ""mistake"" becomes something your boss's campaign can inherit.  The damage to privately owned teslas and tesla dealerships strikes me as tantrum behavior and it doesn't make anyone safer or help political platforms.",atomic1fire,2025-04-18T22:06:39,7

And this may even cause brands to steer clear from activism entirely.  Get associated too much with one cause or political party and risk becoming a magnet for outrage.  Literally all a company has to do is just be boring and unassuming now.,atomic1fire,2025-04-19T10:50:40,1
