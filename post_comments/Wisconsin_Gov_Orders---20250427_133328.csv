This comes after the arrest of Judge Hannah Duggan in Milwaukee for obstructing ICE agents while telling an illegal alien wifebeater to run away and helping him escape. Other Wisconsin judges are threatening to follow suit.  All of this is illegal.  State governors do not get to pick and choose which laws they comply with. Neither do state employees. Obstructing immigration enforcement in order to keep flooding America with illegal aliens is an insurrection and can be put down.,Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-28T05:53:33,0

"I agree but probably for different reasons.   If Wisco doesn‚Äôt get federal funding anymore, then we will be free of the ever changing whims of the president.  This one or any other one.  No legal battles about funding cuts.  Just a big middle finger, and we can decide what‚Äôs best for our state.",Funseas,2025-04-27T17:34:32,-3

"No, because despite the title of this post his instructions are basically to ask a few questions, call legal and don‚Äôt offer assistance.  Not offering assistance is not the same as obstruction.
