"In terms of Chamberlain's foreign policy of 'appeasement', some historical context is necessary.  Neither the UK nor France wanted to go to war. There was strong popular sentiment against it. Moreover, with a hostile Soviet regime, neither nation had any practical ability to influence events in Eastern Europe. All they could do is bluster and bluff.  Which is precisely what Chamberlain did. He bluffed as much as he thought he could get away with. When he proclaimed ""peace in our time"", it was less a matter of naive optimism than it was putting a positive spin on events largely beyond his control.  Ultimately, the entire ""appeasement"" narrative rests on the mistaken notion that the UK had some sort of other option.  In the context of your question, Chamberlain was very much not an isolationist. He simply lacked the power to intervene to the extent he might have preferred. However, remember that the military Churchill went to war with wouldn't have existed if Chamberlain hadn't been busy building it.  Trump, on the other hand, *is* an isolationist. He views the international order from the standpoint of American self-interest and is unwillingness to commit resources to anything that doesn't further this goal.  Trump is also facing a very different situation. Chamberlain lived in a multi-polar world where the future of the UK was highly dependent on the alliances and relative resources of the various European powers. Trump (and you and I) live in a unipolar world where he can draw an arbitrary line on the map, tell the Russians ""here and no further"" and they essentially have to shut up and like it. The American President (any American President) also doesn't need popular support to launch a devastating war against Russia because he can do so with military assets already in play. While he might face some political backlash for such an action, that backlash would occur long after Russian forces were annihilated on the ground.  So Trump isn't trying to bluff or ""appease"" anyone. He has no need to do so.  In terms of the men themselves, they were also very different. Chamberlain was the ultimate insider while Trump is very much an outsider. Even after Chamberlain left office, there was considerable loyalty throughout the British government to him. There is no such loyalty amongst rank-and-file government officials for Trump.  So not only are Trump and Chamberlain very different men with very different attitudes, they face completely different problems.",ViskerRatio,2024-11-08T17:08:44,1
