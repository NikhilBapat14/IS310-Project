Ah I see now that Republicans are in charge it’s ok to raise the debt limit.  Not ok when Democrats are in charge.  Got it.,Electric_Conga,2025-05-09T18:00:23,21
They should get rid of the debt limit. So fucking stupid. Passing spending packages and then having an arbitrary law to decide if you should pay for what you passed. Just stop over spending,henningknows,2025-05-09T17:55:19,11

Trump should not have started the tariffs war,Joey-Tuna-Batters,2025-05-09T19:11:52,1
Nope. Let it all burn.,amberissmiling,2025-05-09T17:51:57,-1
"Meh. Whatever. Another step towards crashing the entire economy? Let us just start defaulting, let them own this disaster more fully.",shoobe01,2025-05-09T19:38:50,-1
"Yeah, only this time they're trying to jack it up $5T all at once instead of a measly $1T or $2T.  Don't want to keep reminding voters of their fiscal hypocrisy before next midterms are done.  Kicking the can out a couple of more years, devastating the economy for future generations.  Eventually they will have no choice but to print money to make debt payments, which will collapse the dollar and trigger hyper-inflation.  Basically stealing from everyone with any dollar-denominated savings without having to pass income-tax hikes or wait around for that pesky revenue collection process.  But insiders will profit, guaranteed!",duzies,2025-05-10T05:27:27,2
"Trump needs that new royal jet and his ego parade though, probably the biggest reason they even have to increase it to pay for his bs.  ",arilupe,2025-05-09T17:58:36,4
There is an argument to be made for shutting down the government as a point of leverage.  There is zero rational argument to be made for the US defaulting on its loans.  The results would be catastrophic with a lot of damage being done to poor and working class people.,aslan_is_on_the_move,2025-05-09T17:54:40,3
There’s already a lot of damage being done. I’m ready to watch it all burn and see what happens,amberissmiling,2025-05-09T17:55:16,-2
"Trump is already trying to push through a delusional plan to have America's debts disappear by either a default or by saying he no longer needs to pay anything so the debt is now 0.  Either way a default on debt is going to happen, Trump has been very clear on that.  Its better to have him hit by a debt limit than to let him dictate the terms of default that gives him more power to start attacking other countries like he talked about for 8 years now.",Chicano_Ducky,2025-05-09T19:21:47,-1
“Let’s watch the house burn and see what happens” is a markedly less fun activity when you’re **locked inside the fucking house!!!**,Cypher_Blue,2025-05-09T18:25:07,5
