"Trump businesses have declared bankruptcy 6 times. Not all were casinos.    In July 1991, Trump’s Taj Mahal filed for bankruptcy. He could not keep up with debts on two other Atlantic City casinos, and those two properties declared bankruptcy in 1992. A fourth property, the Plaza Hotel in New York, declared bankruptcy in 1992 after amassing debt.  PolitiFact uncovered two more bankruptcies filed after 1992, totaling six. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy again in 2004, after accruing about $1.8 billion in debt. Trump Entertainment Resorts also declared bankruptcy in 2009, after being hit hard during the 2008 recession.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2016/live-updates/general-election/real-time-fact-checking-and-analysis-of-the-first-presidential-debate/fact-check-has-trump-declared-bankruptcy-four-or-six-times/",EMTDawg,2025-05-05T06:49:04,7

"I love presidential history, so the main reason I criticize Andrew Johnson as the worst president was him tanking all the gains the US had made from the Civil War, and I largely blame him for why we had to wait 100 years before the Civil Rights movement took place and brought equality for people of color. Andrew Johnson pretty much just gave the south back what they wanted, on the caveat that slavery was abolished, but the south just implemented loopholes around it.  Donald Trump blatantly ignoring the constitution and doing whatever he pleases is a reminder of why the founding fathers considered not having a President to begin with. There is an argument to be made about why he is worse than Andrew Johnson in how he is destroying America for self-gain.  Johnson wanted a quick resolution to a very complicated situation, and it definitely didn't work. Trump is a tyrant with no regard for the common man.",TheInfiniteSlash,2025-05-05T08:11:53,2
