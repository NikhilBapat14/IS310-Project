"Maybe the French second republic. It was pretty liberal for the 1840s, but didn't last long until its own president overthrew the government.",eduffy,2022-12-15T05:01:06,22
"Argentina. It was among the very first countries in the world to abolish slavery, wrote one of the best constitutions in history and was the richest per capita country in the world before the 1930s.  That path was abandoned by successive military coups and formally ditched by Peronism.   In the 1970s it descended to a dictatorship that killed thousands.  Now, the county seems to keep some autoritarian impulses despite renouncing to its violent past and maintaining an uninterrupted democracy and freedoms since 1983.",murchile,2022-12-15T08:51:20,6
Japan in the 1920s and 1930s was one of the most liberal democratic states in the world. It could even in some regards be called progressieve. Ultimately it turned into an authoritarian imperialistic state.,Bram06,2022-12-15T06:44:46,11
"Liberal Democratic states have turned into authoritarian states before, 1930's Germany being a prime example. A good modern example is Hungary, which although it isn't exactly authoritarian has transformed from a modern liberal democracy into an autocracy. Turkey is perhaps another one but Turkey is always a bit of an oddity.   Once a state becomes autocratic or deeply authoritarian though it ceases to be a liberal democracy. The only exception is when a liberal democracy is under extreme threat (e.g total war) and for a defined and short period gives exceptional powers to the executive to solve the issue. Ukraine now for example has martial law but the country has no other choice and once the war ends the executive will return those powers.",hungoverseal,2022-12-15T04:59:30,7
"That's an interesting question. The most egregious example that I can think of you already named: Nazi Germany. I say egregious because they were a proper, functioning, and even fairly stable democracy up until the great depression hit. And the Nazis used that upheaval to seize power mostly democratically combined with a healthy serving of both legal and illegal shady stuff.   To get at the spirit of your question, I'm actually going to say that the answer is mostly No. I'm going to say no because I don't think this has ever happened to a country without major upheaval or unrest in that country setting the stage for those authoritarians. I don't think it's ever just happened that a country decided to become a dictatorship where they had previously been a democracy. The exception to this is of course, many many third world countries. The reason I hesitate to include those is because they have some authoritarian coup every other decade a lot of the time so it's not clear if their norm is authoritarianism or republicanism.   However, I will submit all of Latin American history for your consideration. Coups, strongmen, democracy, communism, they got everything. I just don't know if they are great example of what you are asking about because the democratic governments often don't have a ton of time to be entrenched before the next strongman comes along.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-12-14T20:41:14,16
"Hugo Chavez and Maduro were all about ""the people"" and direct democracy unless it meant they lost power. The thing is populism and direct democracy are not ""Liberal Democracy."" Liberal Democracy has checks on power.   There have been many examples, with Nazi Germany being the most obvious where someone came to power and undermined and ultimately destroyed a liberal democracy in favor of an authoritarian state.",thebigmanhastherock,2022-12-15T11:43:27,2
"Nazism, Italian Fascism, and Spanish Falangism all emerged out of Liberal Democracies.   The United States has always had the institutional structures of a liberal democracy but only counted a fraction of its residents as ""citizens"" until 1918, thus making it authoritarian for most people",loselyconscious,2022-12-16T04:13:16,2
"I think both Nazi Germany and modern Venezuela fit the mold. That's why a democracy needs a strong Constitution to limit and divide the power of those government, especially the executive.",NoTable2313,2022-12-14T20:47:45,7

"What you touch upon is seen as the big question. Fukuyama, whose work I really enjoy, argues in his ""End of History"" that Liberal Democracies is the normative end point for government. As societies open up their market economies, a middle class emerges which is opinionated and believes it has rights which the government must adhere to. This pressure is one aspect which form liberal Democracies. History travel m travels in this direction, but as yet has NOT traveled the other way. Until then Fukuyama's theory stands: history moves towards liberal Democracies.   The US under Trump was under critical threat and US democracy took a hit, but it has been recovering. Nevertheless, it is possible, but hard to do.",gomi-panda,2022-12-15T02:15:25,4
"Argentina, Peru, Chile, Venezula, Brazil, Thailand, Sri Lanka.  Turkey and Hungary seem to be headed that way.  Going farther back, Germany and Spain before WWII.",LiberalAspergers,2022-12-15T12:57:21,1
It's actually very rare to see liberal democratic states collapse into any form of autocracy (defining liberal democracy here as being particularly democratic with wide voter enfranchisement). This is an interesting pattern that is heavily studied in political science and isn't yet fully explained. We believe democracies tend to be super stable based on principles of game theory.,nov4marine,2022-12-15T15:50:20,1
"I would say Myanmar fits this situation, the country was a full fledged democracy under the rule of Aung suyu kuyi. However, we cannot be sure it was that ideal liberal democratic state but she was elected leader. Soon afterwards the coup, the country descended to the Authoritarianism. Nowadays the military has not only jailed political leaders but also started persecutions against the  civil society groups. The new military government has left very little room for dissent and criticism.",shrimp124,2022-12-16T12:57:27,1

You could argue that a transformation from liberal to authoritarian happened under the first and third republics as well. Possibly also the fourth. The country really went through a rollercoaster of different forms of governments.,Anaptyso,2022-12-15T05:33:09,5

Wouldn’t praise their slavery abolition too much considering what they did to their black population after,Gryffindorcommoner,2022-12-15T19:24:10,0
"I get where you’re coming from, but I get a heavy ‘No True Scotsman’ vibe from the examples you’re discounting and why. Primarily the idea that some of the transitions being preceded by upheaval rules them out. That’s the only way something like what OP posed could happen. A functioning legislature and state bureaucracy isn’t just going to hand the keys over when everything is running smoothly. That being said, Nazi Germany and maybe Putin’s Russia are the only examples I can think of. Maybe Franco’s Spain.  I do agree it’s tough with the third world because it’s hard to say if stable democracy has ever existed in a lot of those countries. But that may just be my lack of knowledge. I imagine just by numbers there may be a few that would qualify.",moralprolapse,2022-12-14T22:47:50,6
"I wouldn't call Weimar Germany stable.  Germany almost descended into civil war in 1919-21.  There were mutiple coup attempts in the first half of the 1920s, of which Hitler's Munich Putsch wasn't even the biggest one.  Not many Germans liked the Weimar government even on its best days.  It's why they were not too sad to see it go when the Nazis took over.",Ok-Hurry-4761,2022-12-23T00:12:52,1
"What? The Shah was installed by a coup, and kept the people in line with secret police who ran torture chambers.",BristolShambler,2022-12-15T01:52:42,18
"You have that wildly backwards. The Shah was an absolute dictator installed by Britan and the US, while the subsequent government has elections that reflect some degree of popular will. It has never been a liberal democracy, but the current regime is far closer to it than the Shah was.",LiberalAspergers,2022-12-15T12:54:50,1

"I’d say Nazi Germany is going to be the best example of this. Russia in the 90s was never truly democratic, it always retained a level of police state authoritarianism, and was deeply corrupt.   I’d say a more modern example could be Erdogan - democratically elected to a modern, secular state, who’s then shifted it to a theocratic dictatorship",BristolShambler,2022-12-15T01:57:31,8
"That's a fair criticism. You could definitely say a transition from democracy to authoritarianism requires some kind of unrest, otherwise the authoritarian wouldn't have any kind of popular support, and they do actually need that, at least to some extent.",notpoleonbonaparte,2022-12-14T23:35:21,4
"Yeah I’m not sure about this. The Shah was overthrown by a joint uprising of Marxists, Liberals AND religious traditionalists/extremists. The religious lot just consolidated power very quickly as they were pretty ruthless and organised.  The Shah seems much more similar to the autocratic secular modernisers that were popping up at the time.  Though I’m no expert.",123whyme,2022-12-15T03:50:04,9
"No. None of those countries were ever fully developed modern democracies. If you go by the low bar of whether a country had democracy or not, then you should add ancient Greece and Rome.   There are three main components to a modern democracy: a strong state, the rule of law, and government accountability.   A strong state means that power and enforcement lives with the government, and not in the hands of regional centers, like a warlord.   The rule of law means that all the way up and down all people are subject to the same rules. The powerful are constrained by the same rules as the weak.   Accountability means that those in power are accountable to the people in opposite of a despot.  Take Russia. They had a strong state, but lacked the rule of law and certainly there has never been government accountability. Consider each country you mentioned. They all lacked a critical component necessary to be a modern democracy.",gomi-panda,2022-12-16T10:11:12,2
"The Third Republic is an interesting case. It was overthrown, but as to how republican it was towards the end...And For most of his final time as PM, Daladier ruled by decree. It was not entirely unlike a stabler 1932 Germany.",coldcynic,2022-12-15T12:58:54,1

"I’m honestly not sure what you’re getting at? They’re a subgroup, but distinctive enough that it’s worth noting.",123whyme,2022-12-15T05:13:22,3
"Two things: 20 years is a very brief period of time when considering what Fukuyama notes is required to develop a strong modern democracy, and Orban's existence does not mean that Hungary has backsliding beyond repair,  just as US democracy under Trump suffered tremendously but is recovering.   This is the point: when people gain liberty, they do not prefer to go back to a time without it. Even when an authoritarian leader comes to power and a certain percentage of the population support it, the number of people who wish to *expand* liberal democracy does not easily dwindle but continues to seethe beneath the surface. Czech Republic and Iran are but two examples.   You may find the article and subsequent book The End of History to be informative.",gomi-panda,2022-12-16T19:33:19,0

"I've read The End of History and was not impressed. You seem to be doing the exact thing that liberals accuse Marxists of doing, projecting a view of history onto the past and finding excuses for why when that view of history doesn't work out, ""it doesn't really count.""  First, you said, ""history moves towards liberal Democracies.""  Then you amended that to mean, ""fully developed modern democracies don't backslide.""
