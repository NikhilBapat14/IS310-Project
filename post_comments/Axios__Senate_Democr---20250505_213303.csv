Lmao this absolutely tracks. They love corporate columnists like Klein.   Nothing says today's Democratic Party like inviting someone to tell you what you *want* to hear rather than what you *need* to hear.,walkallover1991,2025-05-05T22:01:45,23
"Memories:  via @HeerJeet on Nov 6, 2024  >To be clear: David Shor got the election he wanted. Harris presented as a moderate, bear-hugged the Cheneys, took crypto money by truck-full (not to mention other donors), ran right on immigration, gave the cold shoulder to those upset at Israel's war in Gaza, disavowed identity politics and in general ran a Shor/Yglesias campaign. We see the results.",BabyYodaX,2025-05-05T21:46:57,21

Next week we will get to hear Schumer at his weekly news conference saying the exact same thing he always says but in an idiolect similar to Ezra Klein.,heismanwinner82,2025-05-05T21:45:12,3
"Now let's hope they don't do any of this Rham Emmanuel center right, advise Obama to kiss Wall Street's ass, Let's show Republicans we are more corporate than they are Clinton bullshit.

"Yeah, this is exactly the problem. They cannot listen to anyone outside of their political pundit/consultant/donor ~~class~~ caste. It's like they're allergic to listening to anyone making less than 6 figures.   I really do see the only solution being the creation of a new, actual left-wing party, and the dissolution of the two-party system. Create a new, actual left-wing party that competes against both Democrats and Republicans and they will trounce them both in 2028 (assuming trump allows an election). It's high time people leveraged social media and grass roots organizing to create a new left-wing party.",valamaladroit,2025-05-05T23:03:43,6
Klein was saying Biden was far too old to run for re-election *long* before it was politically acceptable to do so. I don’t always agree with him but he’s far harsher on the dems than people make him out to be.,Thunderstarter,2025-05-06T01:20:49,2
Have you listened to anything he has put out since the election? Or his new book? He is pretty scathing about the current state of liberal and progressive politics,-Animal_,2025-05-06T06:37:52,-1
The Senate is a factory precision engineered to produce milqetoast centrists. We should relegate it to an irrelevant ceremonial role like the House of Lords in England.,loglighterequipment,2025-05-06T07:38:37,1

You know makes me worry about Slotkin? No one was pushing for her. There was no grassroots support until one day Schumer named her as the future of the party and they’ve been putting her in highly visible positions where she keeps falling on her face. In contrast to an AOC who builds up her reputation over time. Slotkin is a top-down anointed one which makes me very suspicious of who is backing her behind the scenes and why.,ennuiinmotion,2025-05-06T11:11:23,1
"It's just amusing. We see stories all the time about how the Democrats are losing younger voters *and* that the manosphere is fueling a far-right ideology growth amongst younger men.   Then they drag out Ezra Klein when there's literally a guy like Hasan Piker who is a leftist that's extremely popular with younger voters, has a manosphere-like following, and has connections to several Democratic politicians within the Progressive caucus (several of whom have sat down with him, from AOC to Bernie to Greg Casar to Ro Khanna) and literally went and recorded live from the DNC.   Having a guy like Piker appear with you would drastically improve your turnout amongst younger voters.   But then, voters might pressure the DNC into enacting leftist policies that Piker supports, which would be a big no-no in their eyes.",walkallover1991,2025-05-06T00:38:05,2

"The fundamental problem is that Democrats don't know how to talk to people, and (perhaps more importantly) don't know how to sympathize with people. Democrats do a poor job acknowledging people's pain.   Democrats will often do a whole big song and dance that basically goes ""I don't understand what the big deal is, here's a series of facts explaining why your feelings are wrong.""   In the case of the economy for example, your average Democrat leader will say things like, ""What are you talking about? The economy is great! Look at the stock market! Look at the unemployment rate! Look at the GDP!"" It does nothing to acknowledge their pain and suffering, and essentially makes them look crazy.  All of those metrics are worthless if you are working two jobs and are still struggling to make ends meet.   This is something the Republicans do very well, but only for the wrong reason. They will say, ""We feel you. The economy is terrible, and it's because of the Democrat's weak border policy and influx of illegal immigrants. If we win, we will deport all of them which will improve the cost of living.""   Republicans validate emotions, blame some marginalized group, and claim to be able to fix it.   Bernie Sanders (and AOC to some degree) is able to do this well. If you listen to him talk about the economy, he essentially starts by saying ""the economy is rigged against you, your pain is valid"" and then blames the appropriate parties (corporate greed, big money in politics) and proposes policy solutions to fix it.",walkallover1991,2025-05-06T00:29:24,2
