"> Trump has done more in three months than any president in memory to gut government, put civil servants out of work, appoint incompetent people to the highest government positions, create economic turmoil, jeopardize America’s alliances, and undermine the rest of the world’s confidence in the U.S. While he pretends to liberate America from government interference in their lives, he uses the actual or fabricated powers of the presidency to modify the behaviors of individuals and institutions far beyond his administration. It’s a strategy designed to cow his critics and extort society’s institutions and governments into compliance with the rigid ideologies of the far right.",Quirkie,2025-04-28T10:23:17,7
He's an abject failure as a president and as a human being.,AllynCrane,2025-04-28T10:28:56,4
"Once the consequences of Cheeto Hitler's impact the dolts that support him,  his disapproval rating will hit 75% & when the GOP wins overwhelmingly in the rigged 2026 elections the popular uprising will be savage & spectacular.  The remaining 25% will be making excuses for Cheeto Hitler even as they trudge down the HimmelStrasse en route to the Krematorium.  PS:  Don't forget, raise a beer to Charon on Wednesday 4/30/25!  80 years ago the World became a better place thanks to an excellent & well earned self-deletion.",Huge-Platypus9075,2025-04-28T10:29:21,3
I guess this is what a “concept of a plan” looks like in action.,Little-Twist7488,2025-04-28T13:30:23,1
"The majority of Americans are no longer happy with him, particularly with respect to tariffs and the turmoil it is causing, they are also not happy about haphazard executive actions in his attempt to weaken a number of government agencies, most of them are stuck in court, but hurting many Americans in the process either directly or indirectly.  Those who still strongly support him hoovers around 39%. That is what he has accomplished during his first 100 days. Uncertainty at home and abroad. The majority of Americans are extremely pessimistic about their economic outlooks. 60% of American household have 401K. They have lost about 30% of their retirement savings during his first 100 days.  America is now seen by many foreign adversaries as a weakening power, and they are taking advantage and expanding their own soft powers. Even a smaller country like Ukraine is refusing to bow down to his demands. Former allies in EU no longer consider US a reliable partner and EU seems lost and trying to find its own legs to stand on.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-28T10:39:19,4
