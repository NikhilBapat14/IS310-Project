"“If Kamala \[Harris\] wins, only death and destruction await, because she is the candidate of endless wars. I am the candidate of peace,” a buoyant Donald Trump [told crowds](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/trump-liz-cheney-michigan-rally-00186883) at an election rally in Michigan last year. “I am peace.”  Since returning to the White House Trump has pledged to end the violence in Ukraine and Gaza, and reduce the involvement of US troops and resource overseas.  However, Trump has also turned on international allies, launched a global trade war and moved closer to Vladimir Putin’s Russia.  So, as Trump marks 100 days in office, has “the candidate of peace” made the world any safer?  ***The i Paper*** **analyses Trump’s impact and why experts think the world is more volatile now**:  # Europe & Nato: An alliance undermined  Trump has expressed frustration at Europe’s overreliance on the US for its security, with [leaked messages from his Vice President JD Vance](https://inews.co.uk/news/who-trump-aides-texted-war-plans-reporter-group-chat-3603347?ico=most_popular&srsltid=AfmBOoqAR-bgmLcRsnTBOXqwNCteQH0OtlPnwaiPTE8tOpKRCLFk0ndo) calling Europeans “freeloaders”.  Nato – the military alliance that incorporates much of Europe – has been at the cornerstone of Western security since 1945, but Trump has repeatedly undermined it.  He has hinted that the US would withdraw – even saying he would [“encourage” Russia to attack Nato members](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68266447) who do not spend enough on their militaries.

"Has anyone seen his interview on ABC? His doubling, tripling absolutely going to the mats that Mr Garcia had MS13 tattooed on his knuckles? When pointed out by interviewer, politely and in an effort to move on, it was photoshopped as an indication of what the actual tattoos signified, Trump went apeshit. Absolutely believes the characters MS13 were tattooed on the knuckles. Basically called interviewer a liar.   This is who is in charge. This is who calls everyone else dumb, losers, or in Joe Biden’s case still character assassinates every chance he gets as a dopey Joe. You should’ve been careful what you wished for Republicans. I mean this is the type of evidence he believes justifies every illegal and unethical act. Basically nothing. He’s a fucking buffoon, and right now if you’re still happy you voted for him over dopey Joe, you’re in a cult. A very fucking stupid one at that. Enjoy.",chopper160977,2025-04-30T04:22:05,2

"“America is often seen as a superpower because of its capabilities and nuclear weapons, but actually the real superpower the Americans have had has been trust in them as a reliable ally,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security at the defence and security think-tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  “Irrespective of exactly what they’re going to do within Nato – like moving tanks around, or pulling them back – what Trump has done is destroyed this sense of trust which has been the foundation of that relationship.  “There is a feeling that Europe could be attacked and may have to stand alone, and it’s unclear if Europe is actually ready for that.  “There’s no doubt that Europe feels far less safe as a result of Trump.”  Dr Patrick Gill-Tiney, a fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), said that the “significant undermining” of Nato by Trump meant it was less effective at deterring Russian attacks, because it was no longer clear that the US would come to the aid of fellow Nato members.  “This may undermine the defensive planning that Nato undertakes, since it may become unclear what support the US will provide. Not only is the US by far the largest military, it also provides much of the command and control, logistics, and intelligence functions for Nato.“  However, Trump’s uncertainty has forced Europe to take steps to bolster its own security, with a rise in defence spending in Europe and tightening security partnerships on the continent.  The UK is [currently negotiating a defence pact with the EU](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/operation-stop-putin-eu-lays-ground-for-uk-defence-pact-in-brexit-reset-boost-3594704?srsltid=AfmBOopDVxXGQ1CRZhREMQcYdqOH6y-HX3BresQ8MfT1gd7YxcRhPoGT&ico=in-line_link), including a new £126bn rearmament fund which British firms could be eligible to access.  Anna Getmansky, an associate professor of International Relations at LSE, said the deal would likely “increase cooperation on security and also beyond – something that was very unlikely even a few months age”.  # Ukraine: A day-one peace that never came  Trump pledged to bring an end to the war in Ukraine “on day one” of his second term in office, though [US-brokered peace talks have not yet reached a conclusion.](https://inews.co.uk/news/how-putins-violation-of-ukraine-ceasefire-shows-trump-has-failed-again-3650544?ico=in-line_link)  While a ceasefire would, in the short-term, stop the loss of lives, it could make the world less safe in the long run, according to experts.",theipaper,2025-04-30T03:16:57,2

"Trump has appeared to [embrace much of Putin’s narrative about the invasion](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/how-trump-lying-ukraine-zelensky-why-3543666?srsltid=AfmBOopa-tv2ofaBCYWFF9dO-XKF22q5EF82ZSUmXGi4ZCYohAV_q56b&ico=in-line_link) and analysts fear he may agree to the Russian president’s maximalist demands for a ceasefire – potentially including [ceding vast swathes of Ukrainian territory to the Kremlin](https://inews.co.uk/news/ukraine-war-end-maps-3654829?ico=in-line_link) – in a bid to get a deal over the line.  But Trump has [recently expressed frustration with Putin](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/real-putin-clear-trump-hope-easy-peace-deal-3665441?ico=most_popular&srsltid=AfmBOor9cwYYFtcvIyGln6nu7PT6WqhNkTqyIg8Ai3S-VjwVqgf5Sld6) over continued attacks on Ukraine and [met with Volodymyr Zelensky for talks](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/zelensky-trump-meet-first-time-explosive-white-house-clash-3661784?ico=most_popular&srsltid=AfmBOopW7JPKfHwKBxP32wsDiq50OVlbFhS6501NxWEWUvmQVHzChv4y) during a visit to the Vatican for the Pope’s funeral.  Should Putin emerge with a [favourable deal](https://inews.co.uk/news/putin-trump-easter-deadline-delay-3601466?ico=in-line_link) after an illegal invasion in which stolen land becomes Russian, analysts warn he will be emboldened to launch further conflicts in Ukraine and beyond.  “The norm of non-acquisition of territory by force would be undermined,” said Dr Gill-Tiney. “If this is the pathway that the conflict takes, then it would set a precedent for future aggression, by Russia, or others.”  While the depletion of resources and manpower means Putin would be unlikely to invade again in the short term, Russian veterans of the war would have “huge experience of modern interstate warfare“, which would equip them well for future assaults, Dr Gill-Tiney said.  There is also no guarantee a US-brokered ceasefire deal would last without third party peacekeepers, which Ukraine and Russia have so far failed to agree on.  Professor Getmansky said that Russia already appears to have been bolstered by Trump.  “The obvious pro-Russian re-orientation in the US policy – including willingness to support or recognise Russia’s territorial claims and unwillingness to support Ukraine militarily – seem\[s\] to have emboldened Russia,” she said. “The Russian attacks \[last week\] against Kyiv that resulted in nine fatalities are just one example.  “In the short term, I think this change increases the likelihood of conflict escalation in the world.”  # Hybrid conflict: A pass for Russia, and nervy allies  Trump’s administration has [halted all offensive cyber operations against Russia](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2025-03-07/trump-is-giving-russian-cyber-ops-a-free-pass-and-putting-western-democracy-on-the-line) and a senior cybersecurity official appeared to [downgrade Russia as a cyberthreat in a speech to the UN](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-russia-hacking-cyber-security).
