"**Summary**:   Environmental groups warn that Trump’s decision to allow commercial fishing in the Pacific Islands Marine National Monument—a 500,000 sq mile protected zone—threatens pristine coral reefs, endangered species, and shark populations. Established by Bush and expanded by Obama, the monument hosts ancient corals, apex predators, and vital ecosystems. Critics say the move, pushed by tuna lobbyists, risks illegal fishing, bycatch, and long-term fishery collapse. Scientists warn it could undo decades of conservation, harming sharks, turtles, and marine balance. Hawaiian elders and experts stress the area’s cultural and ecological importance, comparing its protection to safeguarding Yellowstone. The policy may backfire, reducing future seafood yields.",pharrt,2025-04-27T07:10:50,14

"He doesn't care.  Fish don't come from the sea they come from the fridge, the ocean is big enough to take care of itself and besides I can't see it so it didn't happen.  He'll be dead in a few years and so why should he give one single solitary toss?",Cyanopicacooki,2025-04-27T07:48:41,11
"Democrats need to make it loud and clear, those who participate in the fishing deregulations now could face prosecution later.   That will pour cold water on their plans.",mycall,2025-04-27T08:22:58,5

Of course it does.  Is there anything he does that *doesn't* pose major risks?,I0I0I0I,2025-04-27T12:06:15,1
Correct. Trump is an absolute sociopath. Only cares about enriching himself and his cronies. Everyday a new pump and dump opportunity. He’s counting on being dead before they can muster the courage to prosecute and jail him.,Millennial_Snowbird,2025-04-27T08:52:58,6
