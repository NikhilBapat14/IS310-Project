"40% approve, 59% disapprove.  Trump's intentional efforts to crash the economy and wipe his ass with the Constitution have made him even more unpopular.",gradientz,2025-04-23T19:07:22,12
"Trump is destroying the government, ignoring the constitution, and started a trade war. 40% of people are supposedly in favor of this or they don't realize it's happening.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-23T20:25:00,2
What does he need approval for?    Bad approval means he wont get votes.  But he's not *running* again.  Bad approval means his legislation may get blocked.  But he's not trying to legislate anything.,roytay,2025-04-23T22:50:26,1

"These people will let our food supply return to The Jungle and consume disease ridden, human limb containing, rat filled goods, just to own the libs. The problem is there are people who vote dem who admit the party’s faults and where they fail to meet our needs; republicans will watch the economy, democracy, and the rights of anyone living in the nation fall apart and it’s not a problem, it’s just a part of Trumps plan.",StoneThrowAway571,2025-04-23T21:30:44,3
"100%. I wish more people understood this. If he gets a 3rd term it's going to be because he ignored the law, not because he was democratically elected. He knew that from the beginning.",acraswell,2025-04-23T22:53:51,0
