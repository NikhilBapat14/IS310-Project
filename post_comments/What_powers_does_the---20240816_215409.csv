"Nah you got it.   The power of a vice president largely depends on the president they serve under and how much power that president is willing to delegate to the vice president. Evaluating how much power a sitting vice president has is futile, as such questions can only be answered in a holistic approach as part of the study of history.  Ex post facto, we have a much better gauge of the dynamics of a presidential administration, as variables cease to change in reference to an administration when that administration ends.  Any substantive analysis of Harris‚Äôs vice presidency won‚Äôt be available for at least twenty years.",[deleted],2024-08-18T17:28:31,11
"You've essentially got it. The position of VP is to break ties in the Senate and take over if the president is incapacitated, anything else they do is extra.   A generous interpretation of the comments your seeing is that people are wondering why Biden didn't do those things as president. The obvious answer is that, one, Biden and Harris are different people who have different personal priorities. Two, Biden was spending a lot of time and energy passing a lot of other important stuff (CHIPS and Science, IRA, Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, etc). And three, the Democratic Party only had two years of control of the US government before they lost the House to the Republicans. Considering the amount of political finagling that they had to do when they had an exact tie in the Senate (and having to deal with Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin) and a single-digit majority in the House, it's astonishing that they were able to do as much as they did in two years.   Congress and the White House are able to multitask to a certain extent but they can't solve every problem simultaneously, not to mention the political energy to solve certain tasks ebbs and flows over time.",colorfulpony,2024-08-18T17:22:52,7
"The Vice president is the president of the senate and can break a tie. Typically, when they go into the senate they have the gavel. They can have the gavel every day if they want.   But, tradition dictates that they are only there to break ties and in ceremonial acts.   After that? There is literally no governmental position for the  president. They are just a backup executive.",CTCELTICSFAN,2024-08-18T20:55:10,3
"John Adams, the first VP famously said the vice presidency is ‚Äúthe most insignificant Office that ever the Invention of Man contrived or his Imagination conceived: and as I can do neither good nor Evil, I must be born away by Others and meet the common Fate.‚Äù  This is poked fun of in the musical Hamilton when Hamilton‚Äôs wife is trying to convince Hamilton to take a break from his duties as Treasury Secretary and take a summer vacations saying ‚ÄúJohn Adams spends the summer with his family.‚Äù And Hamilton responds ‚ÄúJohn Adams doesn‚Äôt have a real job anyway.‚Äù",TarheelFr06,2024-08-18T21:36:33,3
"You are right that the Vice President has no real power, but Presidents will often give their VP a task that they are in charge of. The current narrative (true or not, I haven't researched it) was that Biden put Harris in charge of the border crisis. If true, it could be said that if the Biden administration did nothing about it, it's because she didn't provide any useful input.",Shakezula84,2024-08-19T18:09:09,2
"The Vice President's main job is to preside over the Senate and break tie votes. They're also next in line for the presidency if something happens to the current president. Besides that, their influence depends on their relationship with the president and what they're asked to do. Modern VPs often advise the president, handle diplomatic matters, and lead important projects. So, they can play a big role in shaping government decisions.",Petite_Rosee,2024-08-20T12:16:54,2
The VP has as much power as the president gives them. Biden has recently stated that he delegated a lot of tasks and decisions to Harris.   So it‚Äôs up to you to decide whether or not she did a good job,Legitimate-Repeat-17,2024-10-03T22:37:15,1

"Legal experts from universities like UCLA or Stanford say in their Podcasts (e.g. Legal Tech Podcast): Except for the things you described the vice-president must only be able to breathe. Nothing more. Nothing less. No delegation, no work.   Historically breaking the tie is one of the rarest or most uncommon events in history (e.g. when federal states refused to do things in the early days of the constitutional USA).   It is astonishing that many American people try to enforce their wrong views of having the same power as the president. But is seems like education has gone down to the poo bin from day to day.",GoldenDarknessXx,2024-10-20T14:19:39,1

"Nope. It‚Äôs bc Congress wouldn‚Äôt pass one of the most conservative bipartisan bills in history and they squashed it so that Chump would have something to run on in this election cycle.

"This isn't fully true. She did attempt to make changes on the border, working closely with some of the most conservative Republicans to even some of the most liberal Democrats and in between, to construct a bi partisan border bill, one of the biggest and most effective bills addressing the border ever. One that would have brought intense efficiency to securing the border. And Donald ""The Dump"" Trump called a majority of Republicans and effectively convinced them to kill the bill so he could use it as a campaign strategy to be re-elected and then later pass the same bill so he could say he did it. She made attempts to fix the crisis. She worked diligently on it and came the closest ever in history to bring it to fruition, and the orange #$%&* destroyed it because his malignant narcissism was more important.",AddiBee1111,2024-09-14T09:53:28,1

"No you are right. If people researched it, they would find that (and this is all public so I'm not ""defaming"" her or saying things I shouldn't) she slept her way into Washington.   Her boyfriend, William Brown was the San Francisco Major. Harris was 29 years old, and Brown was 60...tells you something, huh? Before that, she had no interest in politics, with no experience, really. She was even fired as deputy district of Alameda County, California.   What I believe happened is that (and women have a problem with this, historically) she wanted to gain power, particularly over a man. That's why she **chose** to date a man 31 years older. However, I firmly believe that she didn't particularly intend to enter into high political offices, but that William Brown, essentially corrupted her. He just made use and made her thoughts of power 'extreme'.  As many know, western California is very evil. And Brown probably included her into the realm of the Freemasons and Illuminati (those organizations aren't conspiracy theories, they're real and have been promoting communism for over 300 years beginning with the French Revolution).   You can look up ""Zachary King"" former satanist, now devout Catholic. He was the 'High Wizard' of the **World Church of Satan** and describes that abortion is the sacrament of the Satanist-Freemasons-Illuminatis and that they all work together for their own agendas, which are very similar. There very disgusting things that satanists do to late-term aborted babies and such as ""breeders"" for these abortions. All disgusting but not unbelievable. But, that's my thoughts on why I believe she was unfit to be in any position.   I've briefly researched her before she entered politics formally, and would make a judgement that she was a pretty normal girl wanting normal early 20s things (except her father being a communist-freemason).",Usual_Transition_104,2024-11-09T10:38:24,1

"Yes, but it was able to be mitigated by good government. Biden/Harris didn't do that. They accelerated it. It doesn't take a genius to realize that pharmacy companies were making tens-hundreds of billions off of people's downfall.  Why do people not put their old ways of things behind? Half of the United States (and the world) are mentally ill people. We have been getting abuse by the Biden/Harris government for 4 years now. But people don't want to acknowledge it and still cling to them.  It reminds me of abuse victims. People who are getting physically abuse and mentally abused **but** still cling to their abuser because that's all they know and it provides security in a sense. It's harder to change your thinking patterns and easier to stick to the abuses that you know. Come on people. Once a person is abusing you (Biden/Harris), you immediately get them away. Don't linger on what they have done and definitely not on what they can do, because your judgment will always been blocked *and your judgement will only heal once you start to do right things*. People have this imaginary idea that what they do doesn't affect their thinking patterns. If you are subjected to anger or lust, you will be subject to that in EVERYTHING. Not just porn or whatever.
