"My immediate thought is that it definitely hurts their legal case against the Judge they just arrested because Kash didn't give his prosecutors time to write up a more logical reason for arrest buried in legalese.   My second thought is that Kash sending that tweet reveals his personal motivations and thoughts in the process. This could demonstrate bias or failure to conduct a proper investigation. He accused a citizen of breaking a crime without couching it in ""allegedly"" and an assumption of innocence. A competent defense attorney should point out to a Judge he was motivated to arrest her so that he could kidnap the Legal immigrant. Any evidence or arguments presented in her case could be argued to have been the result of a biased investigation.   He basically spelled out that in a sentence, the FBI created a charge for her. And then will conduct an investigation after the fact to actually present a case in court.

"I‚Äôm not arguing maga is right or trying to draw some false equivalence, because there isn‚Äôt one.  Biden was a good President and followed the law. Trump is a dictator. What I‚Äôm saying is that *feeling* you have about mistrusting the trump government is the same *feeling* maga had about Biden‚Äôs administration, even though they were wrong and misled to have that *feeling*. My point is that feeling of mistrust is exactly what led to trump being re-elected, and it largely stemmed from misinformation coming from social media, fox and other conservative media, and foreign (largely Russian) propaganda. If we don‚Äôt root out these issues, we can‚Äôt root out this cancer that has infected our government. Biden winning in 2020 didn‚Äôt end it because it didn‚Äôt fix the root cause. The cancer just continued to fester under the surface.  Just look at Fox News right now in the comment section cheering on the arrest of this Wisconsin judge. To them Biden was the one with the corrupt government and was a dictator, so they felt about Biden the same way you feel about trump now. Again, they are wrong and misled to feel that way, but those feeling are real and have real world consequences as we are currently experiencing.  My main point is our democracy didn‚Äôt die when trump got re-elected. It‚Äôs been slowly dying since 2016 when he won and has assaulted our institutions left and right and sewed so much distrust in them that now neither side has any confidence in our government. The left rightly so given trump is a dictator. The right wrongly so because they‚Äôve been misled. Until we understand that and work on fixing that problem we can‚Äôt truly get back our democracy. Just electing more democrats by slim margins isn‚Äôt going to uproot the misinformation and mistrust maga has in normal institutions, if anything it will only make it fester even more.  I‚Äôm not sure what the answer truly is but we first all need to come to terms with the fact that the distrust is deeply rooted on the right because of misinformation and on the left because of trump actually being a fascist, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúkoombaya‚Äù bridge in the middle we can all meet like Biden and other democrats have tried to forge.",tresben,2025-04-25T12:42:45,3
