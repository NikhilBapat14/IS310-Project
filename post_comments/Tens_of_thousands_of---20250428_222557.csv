"From the article:   More than 50,000 Los Angeles county workers began a two-day strike Monday evening, closing libraries and disrupting administrative operations across the nation’s most populous county.  The two-day strike was initiated in response to failed negotiations with the county for a new contract after the last one expired in March, according to Service Employees International Union Local 721 leaders.  The union represents more than 55,000 workers including public health professionals, social workers, parks and recreation staff, custodians, clerical workers, and more serving a county of 10 million residents. It will be the first time all of its members go on strike, the union said.  “This is the workforce that got LA County through emergency after emergency: the January wildfires, public health emergencies, mental health emergencies, social service emergencies and more,” said union leader David Green in a statement. “That’s why we have had it with the labor law violations and demand respect for our workers""",kootles10,2025-04-28T22:31:03,19

People miss the point so hard when we have strikes that are short like this (1 or 2 days). It’s to show that this many people are upset and those are the types of numbers and loss of profit that will be seen if they decide to do a continuous strike if demands are not met.,Savagescythe,2025-04-29T07:15:16,5
"probably dont have the money, time and lawyers to do so. and even then trump will just tell the la county to lay off those workers to save money",saiyanscaris,2025-04-29T04:19:59,1

"Only two days with plenty of advance warning and SEIU conceded that many employees would get line passes, effectively prohibiting them from striking and refusing to protect them if they did. This “strike” was weak from the start. Shame!",Greenfirelife27,2025-04-29T19:47:41,1
