"Sounds like a violation of Logan act, trying to influence foreign policy with a threat that goes against the wishes of the current admin",arbiter_0115,2025-04-20T19:48:24,71
Alternate title: Authoritarian Dem Threatens Countries that “facilitated authoritarianism in our country” with Authoritarianism.,777_heavy,2025-04-20T14:40:40,124
"Look at how much money was being pumped into supporting the left via USAID etc through NGO's (over 95% of hundreds of billions of dollars was funnelled to leftist organizations and campaign support).  Now look at the returns on that absolutely lopsided support in the national elections (almost literally 50/50).  It will be interesting to see what a truly level playing field looks like.  I'm guessing the Democrats will not like it one bit.  No sir, not one little bit.  Which probably explains why they are freaking out like it's the end of the world right now.  Because for the left, _it kind of is._  -------  edit: forgot to get back to my point, which is that it may not be very urgent for other countries to worry about the ire of the democrats when they return to power, because it looks like that might not be happening for quite a while.",BestSeattle,2025-04-20T14:45:07,68
Ohhh! Love seeing the party that uses the government to politically threaten the people and other countries into submission. ,Iamstillhere44,2025-04-20T14:49:48,65
Dem's are doing everything in their power to ensure it will be at least 20 years before they regain power.,TheLimeyCanuck,2025-04-20T17:39:34,15
"Imagine AOC going up against China, Russia and the Middle East, not to mention our allies.   The Democrats are a joke at this point but there's nothing funny about this geopolitically.",Cool_Cat_Punk,2025-04-20T15:11:43,35
">When we come back to power  A bit presumptuous. The ""pendulum effect"" isn't real, oftentimes ideologies or parties collapse and never return to prominence.",Magehunter_Skassi,2025-04-20T15:15:20,18

"Yep, came here to say exactly this. A congressman has zero authority or place to be threatening foreign countries and it is a clear violation of the Logan act, a naked attempt to intimidate and shape foreign policy of other nations from a position that has not been granted any authority to make such demands or threats on behalf of the United States.",TheSleepyTruth,2025-04-20T22:14:47,16
"When the dem's  come back to power, I'm sure it will be like another Obama/Biden type of foreign policy failure after failure.",GiediOne,2025-04-20T14:46:15,43
