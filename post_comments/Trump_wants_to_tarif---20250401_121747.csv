"This moronic pig is outright saying he's going to make prescription prices worse, cars more expensive, and groceries more expensive. How the fuck does 30% of America still support him? Do they genuinely believe he cares about them? Or is it that they hate the government so much that they voted for a moronic pig to come in and shit all over everything, and they don't care as long as the pig doesn't personally shit on them?",x_xHaunter313,2025-04-01T13:34:47,15

"Welp, here's some meds we get from Canada we won't be able to buy anymore:  Prescription Medications: Advair Diskus (fluticasone/salmeterol), Flovent (fluticasone), Albuterol inhaler, Amoxil (amoxicillin), and Dexilant (dexlansoprazole).   Over-the-Counter Medications: Tylenol (acetaminophen), Advil (ibuprofen), Aleve (naproxen), Nexium (esomeprazole), and Claritin (loratadine).   To name a few.  Did you know:  **An executive order issued by President Joe Biden in 2021 further opened the path for the FDA to work with states to import prescription drugs from Canada**. Florida became the first state to gain such authorization in January 2024.  Ah, so much winning with tRump.  So much winning.",forrestfaun,2025-04-01T16:09:42,1

"I read somewhere (need to find it again to fully explain) that the people you mentioned - that actually applaud his systematic destruction of our Country, crave chaos.  It's something to do with some personality disorder; sorry I don't have it off hand, but it's real.  They actually like seeing this destruction; it gives them a rush of dopamine.",forrestfaun,2025-04-01T16:12:35,4
