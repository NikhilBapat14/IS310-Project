"I was a Clinton democrat. Even voted for Hillary in the 2008 primary in California. The party I knew is long gone. After decades of lying to me about what they stood for, they became this hateful anti American parody of themselves. Trump is like a combination of the best parts of that old party mixed with the things o lived about Reagan as a kid. Meanwhile, my old party continues to its slog off the edge of sanity- finding new and creative ways to let me know I made the right decision to leave them.",d2r_freak,2025-05-10T08:10:53,38
"I used to really like Bernie. I thought he’d return the party and nation to the Clinton/Gore era, but after he basically submitted to the corporate DNC machine during the 2016 and 2020 primaries while still “fighting oligarchy” made me begin to doubt his sincerity.   The nails in the coffin though was the constant lying about the border and immigration by Dems while Biden was in power, along with the media failure to investigate any of their claims. That, and COVID and the assassination attempts.",atcmaybe,2025-05-10T06:33:12,57
"I had been a democrat for a long time. I voted for Trump in 2016 because I have never found Hilary to be sincere. I voted for Biden in 2020 because I was *sick* of hearing about Trump all. The. Time. We still heard about him all the time during Biden’s term.   I noticed Biden looking confused a few times, and recognized it because I’ve had a few relatives with Alzheimer’s. The June debate was a big nail in the coffin for me. I didn’t even want to watch it, but relented and then we were glued. The deception from his administration, his family, the press, etc. I kept thinking, “this man has the nuclear codes.” My husband and I stayed up until midnight watching the aftermath. Say what you will about Anderson Cooper, but he really pressed Kamala on live TV, “Is this the Biden you see everyday?” She got pissed and visibly irritated. Red flags everywhere.",According_To_Me,2025-05-10T07:15:28,35
"Even though I’ve gotten so much more conservative in the last five years, it was hard to unlearn TDS. Even now that I’m on the guy’s side sometimes I still fucking can’t stand the shit he does. I don’t get why he talks so much shit. That’s how we have Carney instead of Polievre. I was set on voting for my dog, but Trump gained more of my respect just by being reasonable over and over in his positions, then Butler, and then it turned out he never called Nazis fine people, and then a million things, but it’s basically the story of Covid teaching me I can’t trust the media and that everything I knew was wrong. I didn’t fully get it until Butler though.",UltraAirWolf,2025-05-10T10:47:43,5
"I was an Obama-voting Democrat until 2016 when James Comey gave that fateful speech about HRC.  Pull on that thread and it is quite easy to realize not only the DNC, but basically all modern progressivism is just lies and/or half-truths, all the way down.  I have no appropriate political label for myself at this point except that i believe Trump is the president America needs today.",BIG_BOTTOM_TEXT,2025-05-10T05:57:43,34

"I was a Democrat all my life. I was mortified on the night Trump won the election in 2016.  But then I started saw a roaring stock market, record low unemployment with virtually no inflation, and the most peaceful president since Carter.  Meanwhile the press was always 100% against Trump.  It was so shameless.    The crack that broke the dam - a friend on Facebook posted a story about Trump having a meltdown during a press conference - the one with Jim Acosta. I wrote that it was Jim Acosta who was out of line.  From the reaction, you would have thought I said the n word.    The final straw was the law fare.  Especially the New York cases.",goinsouth85,2025-05-10T03:14:38,48
"I grew up in a Democrat household and was passionately ignorant as I look back on my old self. I believed in “being a good person” and thought the democrats had a monopoly on that. Then I went to college and took an economics class and started to realize that while well meaning, many democrat policies had the opposite of the intended effect. (Minimum wage, for example). I voted for Obama, and strongly urged my boyfriend to do the same. I so badly wanted to believe Obama was the right choice. But then, he was horrible. I started opening my eyes further. Then when I saw the Kavanaugh hearings, and how the democrats pushed “believe all women” even though she was obviously not credible… that sealed it for me. I haven’t voted democrat since and can’t see ever doing so again. The more educated I’ve become, the more critical thinking I’ve done, the more to the right I’ve become. The final piece was when I did some soul searching about abortion. I had always believed a woman should have the choice. And I was fed the lie about a clump of cells. Choosing to be pro life was the last remaining part of my left leaning positions. Then I had a baby and realized I can’t understand how any woman can be pro choice. It’s been a long and eye opening journey for me.    I didn’t vote for Trump the first time because he was volatile and unpredictable and I didn’t think he would actually do what he promised. I did vote for him in 2020 and 2024 happily after he proved me wrong in his first term.",HappyFormerDem,2025-05-10T08:10:16,17
"When they started telling white kids they are racist, and when they gave white kids a pathway to victimhood by suggesting there are more than two sexes, I drew a line. I am supportive of everyone being free to achieve the American Dream, not just people who have been told by our public servants they are victims. So we need different public servants and that's how I am going to vote.",obscurityknocks,2025-05-10T14:12:46,2

"The enraged mass hysteria of TDS is the exact reason why. It began immediately and never took a break, there was never a high quality high information strong platform opposition to Trump it was always just a decrepit principate going ballistic to protect its interests.  The way any Dem with real appeal to the masses gets chucked into the dumpster by party elites and replaced with another chalkboard rake just confirms that the party has no interest in putting forward what the people want. The Dems need mass primarying sprees the way we're doing, and we need to step ours up.",D_Ethan_Bones,2025-05-10T13:50:39,1
"Trump’s biggest flaw is his ego and mouth. He always takes bait and can’t pass up an opportunity to troll. While it’s often hilarious, it makes things a lot harder than they otherwise would be. That being said, if you ignore his words and look at his actions he’s pretty good. Even his words are a mixed bag because while sometimes they’re cringeworthy, it is nice to finally see someone call out the media on their lies and propaganda.",MulticamTropic,2025-05-10T08:34:29,36
"Bernie went from championing a border wall in 2014-2015, then immediately flipped to the opposite position, and at this point is just generally pro migration.",tim310rd,2025-05-10T07:14:21,23
>I have no appropriate political label for myself at this point except that i believe Trump is the president America needs today.  I like that characterization and believe it's how a lot of people feel.  Voting for Trump does not necessarily make you a Republican or conservative.  It's been said many times that he's like a '90s Democrat.,phdibart,2025-05-10T08:14:01,16
"When you start to see the vulnerabilities in the system, the ones that are present everywhere, I think you start to see who is defending them with their policies and who is not.  Conservatives are not even remotely perfect in defending them, but they at least keep them at the forefront of the discussion, where democrats pick things too far removed from the basic system issues, when they are attempting to be noble. But other times they truly seem trying to break the system. Whether it's lawfare against Trump or anyone else, whether it's not funding the police, whether it's promoting sexual deviance. All of those things hurt parts of the system, the legal system, basic law and order, and our posterity in the case of what I listed before.  They focus on racism so damn much, and I hate racism, but racism doesn't really matter if the whole system is broken. And they just don't see how we are always dangerously close to the system faltering, even in good times. The just think it will always work, or there are some who think the system needs to come down.... and those ones don't truly know the horror of what that means.",MikeyPh,2025-05-10T05:13:56,20

Ironically the Democrats have made actual racism harder to deal with because they call everyone and everything racist. People have gotten desensitized to the word and ignore most racism accusations now. It’s the little boy who cried wolf in the form of a national political party. ,MulticamTropic,2025-05-10T08:29:15,12
"Yeah, maybe I didn't say it clearly.  You're right, he *was*, he's not like.  It's like that meme Musk posted of him standing in the same spot and the left moving far away.",phdibart,2025-05-10T08:30:02,7
"There is so much irony to it. Frederick Douglas warned about people who constantly made race and the ills of slavery a political thing. He just wanted to move on from it. He wanted people to be aware of it, and I assume repent for it, but he wanted to be forgiving and to move on. But the left won't let any of the sins of our past go.",MikeyPh,2025-05-10T08:58:18,8
"Yep- and what continues to blow my mind is that Redditors will claim, with full sincerity I believe, that the Democratic Party has continually shifted right in the past 30 years. I’ve tried having conversations about it. I’ve even mapped out unequivocal proof that’s not correct.   Nope- ultimately when cornered they just start screaming about the Overton window and the media “normalizing” trump. So I gave up trying and now I just pity them for being so simple brained.",Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-10T08:33:29,11
