"## Summary:    Mattel said it’s considering raising prices on U.S. toy shoppers, a warning that comes one day after **President Donald Trump doubled down on comments that American children don’t need more than a handful of dolls**.  **Trump’s tariffs have put price hikes** on the table: “Where necessary, we will be taking pricing action in the U.S.”  Mattel said Monday that it still expects 40% to 50% of its products to cost $20 or less  **Mattel’s stock has fallen more than 18% since April 2**, the day Trump unveiled a sweeping set of global tariffs that he partially walked back days later.   The company held off providing a financial outlook for the year, a step Ford also took Monday.",Aakash7aak,2025-05-06T14:08:42,4
"""Asked on CNBC on Tuesday whether Mattel could realistically bring more manufacturing back into the U.S. — one of the Trump administration’s top goals with tariffs — Kreiz said, “We don’t see that happening.”""",koi-lotus-water-pond,2025-05-06T17:29:38,3
"As a “high end” action figure collector, I can safely say these things are already overpriced. The factories making the legit stuff were also churning out bootlegs minus the corporate trademarks branded on the figures. A $25 figure here was $5-6 shipped from China. Virtually indistinguishable. Same with Lego. Knockoffs just remove the Lego from the pegs and I’ve seen finished pieces that cost $150 as a bootleg that are being sold for $700-800 by Lego. And I’ve also seen the bootlegs packaged better  in terms of bagging bricks.",M-O-D-O-K,2025-05-06T14:12:34,7
Something tells me that during Christmas’ past there was drama in the gold encrusted Trump household regarding dolls and pencils. Maybe thirty dolls weren’t enough for Ivanka one year. Maybe Eric didn’t get the 250 piece color pencil artist set another. Donnie’s recent statements now seem absolutely Freudian.,RedditReader4031,2025-05-06T18:37:57,2

How many Barbie's did little Ivanka have when she was growing up???,RiseDelicious3556,2025-05-07T07:29:41,2
I found quite a few figures in china town in Chinese boxes that I just saw at a comic convention in English packaging at double to triple the price.,not_a_moogle,2025-05-06T18:21:06,2
