"Warrantless arrests; human rights violations; rolling back civil rights; unconstitutional executive actions; the erosion of free speech; the undermining of democracy and the checks and balances that hold it together; the unlawful deportations of hundreds of ""undesirables"" without due process; throwing foreign students into unmarked vehicles *takes a breath*...  ... Overstepping congressional authority; stripping civil servants of their protections; rampant cronyism; Christian nationalists flouting the first amendment; suppression of the arts, the free press and independent journalism; attacks on law firms and universities; defunding education; weakening our alliances; escalating economic and diplomatic tensions with other countries; flagging historical content, thousands of images and hundreds of terms for removal; restricting access to public information; defying court orders; threatening retribution against political opponents, and the list goes on...  Just another exhausting week of living under the current regime.",Choice-of-SteinsGate,2025-04-24T23:37:16,89

Why would they care whether they have a warrant again?  It's not like they care about court rulings FFS.,thieh,2025-04-24T22:41:15,28

"Every single one of these actions we were assured from people across the spectrum that these ""would never happen"" and we were being paranoid and hysterical for thinking they would happen. Just pick any of these those of us who knew better and said we think could happen if he won and guarantee you you'd be called hysterical for suggesting it.",finsane86,2025-04-25T09:35:20,3

Republicans won't always be in power. And democrats will enjoy expanded powers this administration opened for them.,sixothree,2025-04-25T10:22:38,0
Or for that matter the Stasi. There’s a reason the #1 insult in Germany is to call someone a “Nazi” and the #2 insult is to call someone a “Stasi”,P1xelHunter78,2025-04-25T05:33:05,4

"A warrant *is* needed. ICE normally works on warrants signed by federal judges, or assists local police forces working on warrants signed by local judges. You don't *have* to be like this.",airfryerfuntime,2025-04-25T06:53:29,20
"You have no idea what you’re talking about. Read the article, they alleged exigent circumstances. Has nothing to do with green card revocation.",sportyspice303,2025-04-25T01:20:35,29
"In order for the government to make an arrest they need to witness you committing the crime in real time, have probable cause you committed the crime in question, or have a warrant. There is also exigent circumstances which would be the risk of evidence being destroyed (which does not apply here) or an imminent threat to public safety (which also does not apply here).   Being in the country after your green card is revoked is not a crime because you are given time to self deport. Which is irrelevant since Khalil was taken into custody on March 8th and the administration didn't even announce plans to revoke his green card until March 12th meaning that when he was arrested he had a valid and current green card.",loki2002,2025-04-25T05:57:42,17

I suspect both Nazi and Stasi followed more rigerous processes. Both were based on bureaucracy priding themselves of being organized and following rules. What we see today is unfortunatly closer to the anarchy of the dystopian The Purge sequel.,SeenItAllHeardItAll,2025-04-25T09:31:26,2
