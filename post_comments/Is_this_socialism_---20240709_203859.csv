"No, that's not remotely socialism.  True socialism (classic definition) is about public ownership fo the means of production, like factories and such.   Corruption in small towns isn't that uncommon though, and Illinois is well known for having corruption problems.  Using 'make' isn't necessarily about generating profit, they could just be using the term to refer to how much revenue it takes in, and how it's used to offset the expenses.  Don't expect a great deal of precision in language, small town government doesn't get the best and the brightest people.  If you want to actually know you need to go to the town hall and find out which things are public records and dig through the financial records yourself.",zlefin_actual,2024-07-11T09:57:37,1
"Without knowing every detail of the budget, it's very possible that any ""profits"" made by the fees are earmarked for specific projects. Kinda like how in my state, lottery profits go into education programs.",Shakezula84,2024-07-12T19:55:12,1
