"Republicans should have no problem with this, given that the other countries are supposedly the ones who are paying the tariff.",Beer-Me,2025-05-08T18:42:18,6
">Rep. [Jamie Raskin ](https://thehill.com/people/jamie-raskin/)(D-Md.) said Thursday he would introduce a bill requiring retailers to display any rise in cost on products caused by President Trump’s tariffs.   >The idea was reportedly floated within Amazon before ultimately being scrapped when it became public, and the White House called it a “hostile and political act.”  >Senate Minority Leader [Chuck Schumer ](https://thehill.com/people/chuck-schumer/)(D-N.Y.) is planning to introduce the “Truth in Tariffs Act” in the upper chamber.  This won't go anywhere, but good on them for trying. Meanwhile, the ""Do Something"" crowd more than likely still won't give Democrats credit for...doing something.",jml510,2025-05-08T21:39:51,4

This is a waste of time. No one cares and more than that no one will ever hear of it. Stop letting these old career politicians make it seem like the only thing the democrat party is is against trump.  Stop this. It’s not working.  Losers.   Put forward bills with a competing idea on how to help people. Stop with this waste of time nonsense.  I f’n hate the current democratic leadership.  They don’t get it. ,Ashamed_Job_8151,2025-05-08T22:07:45,0
