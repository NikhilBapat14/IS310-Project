First hand lesson why due process matters.    It saves us a fuck load of lawsuits too,Parking_Bullfrog9329,2025-05-09T11:50:53,56
"That's on brand for these nazis. Technically, they don't have citizenship yet, so best get them before they complete the process. Plus it has the added benefit of scaring others into not even trying",sirhackenslash,2025-05-09T12:04:25,39
"Thanks for sharing this. I wish every American would read this story.   >Border Patrol agents, they say, are arresting people who have valid work permits, no criminal records, and who are following lawful pathways to permanent status.Â   Yeah, so much for ""illegal violent gang members!!"" and whatever. So much for ""We're not anti-immigrant; we just want them to come in legally!""  I'm honestly running out of words. I don't know what to say to describe my feelings about what happened to an asylum seeker mentioned in this story. The asylum seeker from Venezuela was not committing any crimes, and he had a work permit. But he still got arrested because...  >someone called in to report a van transporting ""possible illegal aliens.""  ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„  A completely innocent man got arrested for that reason. And despite his work permit, border patrol agents decided the man was an illegal immigrant. Then the man explained why he was seeking asylum, and he was found to be credible, and yet, he was still ordered to be deported!  >Benitez said he's not sure when, or to which country, his client will be deported.  We all know where a bunch of other Venezuelan men have been deported to...  I don't even know how to react anymore. A completely innocent person who did nothing wrong at all whatsoever is being deported for no reason. Unless this article is inaccurate and there's a missing piece to the story, that's what happened! I guess all I can say is ""The cruelty is the point.""",sachiprecious,2025-05-09T12:21:35,24
"Everyday another story of ICE attacking legal residents and immigrants.  It's almost like there never really was an ""INVASION"" after all. They're so desperate to find deportees  they have to manufacture them.",5minArgument,2025-05-09T13:35:55,12
I hope these people get a nice big fat class action suit together.,Otherwise-Print6085,2025-05-09T12:11:00,11
And whatâ€™s the question. This is a campaign of fear and hatred. Powerful and the weak. MAGA perfection. All this winning is to much.,Complete-Breakfast90,2025-05-09T13:27:00,5
I wonder what would happen if we studied the income levels or net worth of the people being turned away compared to the people being allowed in.,StevesRune,2025-05-09T13:30:26,3
There are 10's of thousands of people that work for border control. I'm surprised none of them have spoken up about what the hell is going on.,Bad-job-dad,2025-05-09T15:00:46,3
Huh. So giving them an evil quota to follow means theyâ€™re picking all the lowest possible fruit?  I mean it tracks. Criminals might have guns and weâ€™ve seen how well law enforcement performs there.,zffjk,2025-05-09T16:13:46,2

What the fuck is border patrol doing in God damn maine,thanethegreat,2025-05-10T01:06:31,1
Also prolly going after people in the process of legal immigration proceedings because itâ€™s easier to go after documented people. By definition their whereabouts are in the system already right?,Hefty_Musician2402,2025-05-09T12:13:08,24

"Short awnser is canada is on the border, long awnser is we use a lot of immigrant labor to either build shit or pick blueberries (probably more stuff too but that's what  I know of as a lifetime resident).... And Canada is on the border.",biguyfrommaine,2025-05-10T09:55:31,1
"Early on there was some discussion that they seemed to be unable to find enough legit immigration violators, so to meet anything resembling the quotas handed down from on high we're just grabbing up anyone they possibly could who fell under their jurisdiction. Lacking anything like due process it doesn't matter if you're completely abiding by all the laws to this administration.",shoobe01,2025-05-10T15:06:35,1
