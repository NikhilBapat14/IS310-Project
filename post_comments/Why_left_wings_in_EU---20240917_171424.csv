"Israel/Palestine definitely seems to take up a lot of the ""discourse"", but I think you are just wrong, the European left does not ignore other oppressed people. You can easily find examples of the European Left calling for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, standing up for Kurds, standing up for refugees",loselyconscious,2024-09-19T00:22:55,6
They don't forget. It's prominent in the media now. They've been behind Ukraine. There are 52 conflicts in the world today. Pick one.,K-Puddin,2024-09-28T23:32:01,3
"One major difference between Palastina and other conflicts is that supporters and detractors of Israel live side by side, sharing the same media spaces.  There's a saying that the quickest ways to get answers on the internet is to say something wrong. Now understand that half the people think the other halfs view of the conflict is wrong, and vice versa.   As for Russia, people supporting Russia tend to be misguided extremists on either flank, this isn't left wing nor right wing, and is not supported by a majority in any major western political movement.",asphias,2024-09-18T09:25:48,3
"I'm not in the EU so I have no idea how they think, but I imagine it would be more of a case of what's happening right now. Is Israel bombing the crap out of Armenian civilians? People would notice that and care about it. If Israel were not bombing civilians places like Gaza, and not oppressing the Palestinians, the world would go back to not particularly caring about Palestine because nothing would be wrong there.   A better example might be Africa with places like Darfur that never really seem to be on any news.",GTRacer1972,2024-10-24T20:21:31,1
"This is a very touchy subject. I would perhaps suggest that Western Europe has ***always*** had a...complicated relationship with Jews. Even in states that you don't think have done anything overtly violent to their Jewish population, you're wrong. You might have to go back to the middle ages, or the reformation, or any major societal/governmental upheaval, but somewhere it's going to be there.  At that same time, Europe is also not exactly friendly to Muslim interests, either. But I would argue that the anti-Jewish anti-Semitism is more ingrained than the anti-Muslim anti-Semitism, since the Hebrew population of Europe was essentially forced upon Europe during the Roman Empire (130-140 CE), whereas Islam has really only been a factor, geopolitically, since the 700-800s CE.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-18T10:59:42,1
I agree üíØ-I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen the same level of support since Bob Geldof and feed the world for the famine in Ethiopia in the early 80‚Äôs.,Time_Interview3972,2024-09-22T15:19:36,1
"Because the primary goal of far left wing western movements is to blame the west and whites for the worlds problems. Israel is seen as a white, western colonialist project that stole land from brown Arabs so it fits nicely into the narrative.  Other oppressed or mistreated people do not fit into their framework or narrative where the west and whites are to blame for things, so they are not really interested in what happens there.  Its the same reason Fox news will devote endless attention anytime an illegal immigrant commits a crime, but could care less when a native born white person commits a crime. Because they are pushing a narrative that brown skinned immigrants are dangerous.",Five_Decades,2024-09-23T14:35:24,1
">As for Russia, people supporting Russia tend to be misguided extremists on either flank, this isn't left wing nor right wing, and is not supported by a majority in any major western political movement.  Europeans are also facing the effects of this conflict far more than we (Americans) are. I think there are probably a lot of Europeans who are not pro-Russia, but feel like supporting Ukraine is asking Europeans to pay (again) for American foreign policy. I don't agree with that argument at all, but it's far easier to view the conflict purely from a moral perspective when we are separated by an ocean and high domestic oil production. The far left and right are taking advantage of that sentiment, but I don't think it is fair to criticize all European hesitation about supporting Ukraine as merely ""misguided extremism.""",loselyconscious,2024-09-19T01:13:23,1
"I don't know why this got downvoted, I think you are 100% right. Most of Europe was implicated in the holocaust and as such Israel/Palestine is a continuation of European History in many ways. Europe's legacies of antisemitism and colonialism are involved in ways that are obviously going to attract their attention more than things they (imagine) have nothing to do with them.",loselyconscious,2024-09-19T00:21:40,1
"He's getting downvoted because it's a very partisan talking point to argue that people are mainly protesting against Israel because of antisemitism.   I'm not naive. I know that there *are* anti-Semites among the supporters of palastine. But there's a far bigger group that - rightly or wrongly - observes this conflict as an oppressor-oppressed conflict. And you don't have to look far to see evidence for that if you're looking at the conflict through the eye of ''oppressor/oppressed''. You have the closed borders, airspace, and seas around gaza equating it to an open air prison, and you have the step by step colonization of the west bank, and you have the massive difference in military power.   I'm not saying that those surface level observations are an accurate description of the entire conflict with its entire history, but i think that ignoring these arguments and focusing purely on the supposed antisemitism of current day europeans is a strong misrepresentation of the facts.",asphias,2024-09-19T01:30:26,2
"I freely admit bias, but in order to understand why Israel behaves the way it does currently you *have* to accept the history of what happened prior to the establishment of the state of Israel. Ever since the Diaspora and the rise of Christianity in Europe, Jews have been treated as pariahs, burdens, or the focus of pogroms. Stretching back from the middle ages all the way up to the Holocaust. Isn't it understandable that a people forced out of their home and rejected to the point of murder in every other society they've tried to live in would want their own country (the irony of the current situation is definitely ***not*** lost on me, by the way)? Zionism has many origins, but this is the main one; to have a homeland of their own where they are not the minority and most importantly (to the current situation) are not subject to the will of the surrounding populace for their safety and wellbeing.  So, population of a religious minority everywhere they've been other than their original homeland which was taken from them by a continent spanning empire (who also renamed their homeland after their ancient adversary, the Philistines), an empire which then foisted them upon the populations which would kill, persecute, and otherwise treat them as third class citizens for hundreds of years up to an including the attempted extermination of their race in WW2. This minority finally has enough and uses some very suss methods to achieve this goal of a return to their ancient homeland. Sound familiar, to a degree?  The origins of the IDF/Mossad are in the armed Jewish resistance movements in Eastern and Western Europe during Nazi occupation. Their 'DNA', or modus operandi is decisive, overwhelming, and morale crushing acts of violence in the extreme, to cow the opposition or to indicate what the cost of continuing to kill Jews will be. They learned this under the most extreme and terrifying occupation in modern history.  70 years of continued conflict with their neighbors and random acts of violence from multitudinous terrorist organizations has changed the arithmetic for them, and while I ***definitely do not agree with the current regime*** I *understand* how it got to this point. The same way I *understand* where the Palestinians are coming from. There needs to be a two state solution at some point, Israeli expansion into areas they have been forbidden from colonizing needs to stop, ***but so do the random acts of violence committed by Hamas, Hezbollah, and other entities***.  Golda Meir said ‚Äú**If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence.**¬†**If the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel.‚Äù**  This has not completely ceased being true, but if Netanyahu and his ilk have their way, the future where Jews put down their weapons will never come to be, regardless of what the Arabs do.  Another quote of hers I think about sometimes, and one that also stops being salient the more fear takes control of the Israeli government:  ‚Äú**We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them for forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us**‚Äù  But the pro-Palestinian movement usually paints Israel as the sole aggressor in this situation, and while I agree that right now they are punching down, it's not beyond the realm of understanding as to *why* their response is outsized. The current regime has taken advantage of the extreme fear and fatigue of the Israeli people (the vast majority of whom, if you were to have a 'participation required' poll where a two state solution was offered as an option *to end the violence* would opt for the two state solution) to pursue its own Agenda of Irony.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T07:52:51,3
"Before i respond, i'd like to ask, what point are you trying to make?  I responded to a question about downvotes, where i explained that he was downvoted because he argued that ""left wing people in europe today support palastinians because of anti-semitism.""  I appreciate your well-written and nuanced essay, but i don't see you touch on antisemitism in western europe today, so i'm not sure what you're trying to argue for or against.",asphias,2024-09-19T15:20:36,1
"It's that leftists are missing the forest for the trees, and forgetting that Jews have been a marginalized society in every place they've ever been other than their original homeland. And if that's *not* the case, and they're aware of the history of the Jewish people and just don't care, there is usually a reason for that and it's not usually one that *doesn't* involve hating/disliking/distrusting Jews in some way.  I am decisively left leaning, but I'm aware of the history, and therefore am extremely conflicted in my current views of the situation. But I would *never* consider 'from the river to the sea'.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T15:24:32,1
"I understand where you're coming from, but even you say that you are ""extremely conflicted"" in your views. Don't you think that many other left-wing people are *also* just as nuanced and conflicted in their view, but despite knowing the entire history *still* cannot accept oppression, *even* from a people that has a long history of being oppressed.  I definitely understand how the situation grew this way. But understanding and acceptance are two different things, and despite knowing very well how desperate and tragic the history of the jewish people is, two wrongs do not make a right. Our challenge is to end generational trauma, not to justify it.  I find it a very distasteful suggestion that if we reach a different conclusion from the same complex history, it must mean that we are antisemitic, rather than value the facts differently.",asphias,2024-09-19T15:47:22,1
"And in order for that generational violence; which has been enacted by both sides; to come to an end, someone is going to have to stop shooting.  And historically speaking, I can understand why the Israelis don't feel that they can.  My fear is that the window of opportunity is closing, and the more the Netanyahu 'shoot first, second, and all the time' regime entrenches the less likely it becomes that it will ever open again.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T15:54:01,1
"Okey, good point.  But do you agree that claiming the left wing of Europe is antisemitic for supporting Israel is counterproductive and distasteful?  You keep trying to move the discussion to the problem itself, rather than the question of OP. I know i'm not going to solve the Israel-Palastina conflict in this reddit thread. But i can argue strongly against the distasteful and wrongful claims that criticism of Israel from the left wing in the EU is based purely on antisemitism. I hope you can agree with me on that.",asphias,2024-09-19T16:00:35,3
"For *not* supporting, you mean? I think it depends on where it comes from. If it's from a place of hate, then it's proving exactly why Israel needs to exist. If it's coming from a place that just wants human suffering to end, then it's coming from a noble part of the human spirit that sadly doesn't understand the history. And if it's coming from a place of anti-colonial sympathy...the Jews are the *first* forcefully displaced people in semi-modern history. The Big Bad of the time kicked them out of their home and turned it into a colony.  But I absolutely agree that it's not *exclusively* hatred of Jews that drives left-wing support of Palestine. But the loudest people in the crowd who are frothing at the mouth are *usually* anti-Semitic. At least that has been my experience. But I also hear the dog-whistle a little more acutely than someone who isn't Jewish might. Call it a self defense mechanism.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T16:12:07,1
>¬†But the loudest people in the crowd who are frothing at the mouth are usually anti-Semitic.¬†   The loudest people in any group are a terrible representative of them. I should hope i don't have to base my view of Israel on the loudest people among them?,asphias,2024-09-19T16:37:17,2
"I certainly hope not, as well. I hope nothing I said previously came across as a definitive blanket statement, because that was not the intent. I was more explaining why there is an antisemitic vein in a lot of pro Palestinian discourse. No viewpoint is monolithic.  As a Jew, some of the things I've been seeing from Israel chill me to my core. Celebrating anyone's death is not in line with my view of our religion. 'Remember, never forget' has always meant; to me, at least; that we must remember the perverting quality hate has, and be just as vigilant against it in ourselves as we are for being aware of it in others.",alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T16:41:36,1
"Alright. It seems like we agree on a lot of things, so thanks for the discussion.   I'm still not sure i'm very happy about having to defend the idea that not all criticism of Israel is antisemitism, but i also understand how the loudest voices can sometimes make it feel that way(especially with both sides amplifying the more extreme views of the other to discredit them).   Thanks for the pleasant discussion¬†",asphias,2024-09-19T16:46:54,2
Imagine having to defend being a Zionist (which I am) and balancing that viewpoint with the actions of the current regime. It's been a rough couple of years.,alkalineruxpin,2024-09-19T16:48:37,1
