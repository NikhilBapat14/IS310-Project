"He is a jester...   If you don't like the actress and you wont pay to see her movies, the studio won't want to hire her because she is box office poison.  Just like the issue with Bud Light, they hired a spokesperson who caused sales to tank, which means Bud was losing money.   Simple Capitalism.",ComputerRedneck,2025-05-09T12:14:31,-2
Sorry... Have you really never heard of this guy? He was everywhere in the 90s so I'm guessing you were born around then?,MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-09T09:32:41,3

Literally never heard his name til just now. Also even if Dave chapelle or bill burr said it I wouldn’t care. These people tell me jokes and that’s all I take from them.,Funny-Apricot-0712,2025-05-09T10:11:04,-1
