"Kamala Harris will.

The Twelfth Amendment to the US Constitution says...   >the President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted  Vice President Kamala Harris is the president of the Senate, therefore she will oversee the vote count, regardless of if she is a candidate or not.
