"From the article:   A coalition of attorneys general in 19 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration over its “unconstitutional dismantling” of the Department of Health and Human Services.   The lawsuit seeks to stop the “restructuring” overseen by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arguing the effort has gutted the agency and destroyed life-saving programs, causing significant harm for the plaintiff states.    The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington D.C. on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said.   “This administration is not streamlining the federal government; they are sabotaging it and all of us,” James said in a statement. “When you fire the scientists who research infectious diseases, silence the doctors who care for pregnant patients, and shut down the programs that help firefighters and miners breathe or children thrive, you are not making America healthy – you are putting countless lives at risk.”   Attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia all signed onto the complaint.",kootles10,2025-05-05T17:28:00,28

"The Attorneys General connected to the Republican Attorneys General Association would never go after Trump.  Here’s what RAGA likes to get up to:  The Nation - [Justice on the Ballot - Meet the MAGA Zealots Who Are Gunning to Become Their State’s Top Prosecutors](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/republican-attorney-general-association-raga-election/)  “To help promote this dreadful work, Republicans have an organization in place that both amplifies the efforts of existing authoritarian AGs and recruits and backs future ones. It’s called the Republican Attorneys General Association, or RAGA. Founded in 1999 as part of the Republican State Leadership Committee (a group devoted to getting Republicans elected to statewide office), RAGA split off as its own entity in 2014. Since then, a villainous row of wealthy Republican donors have poured millions upon millions of dollars into the group, successfully installing their candidates in the top prosecutor spots and making sure that, once in office, those Republican AGs do what their donors paid for.”  “Step one: An attorney general files a test case—a lawsuit that the AG knows violates federal law and, just as often, basic logic.   Step two: Other RAGA AGs join the fight.   Step three: The lawsuit is either rejected by the lower court or, if a Trump judge is presiding, accepted—but in either case, the ruling is almost always appealed by the losing side.   Step four: RAGA’s friends on the Supreme Court take the opportunity to intervene and, in most cases, change the federal law to align with Republican political or cultural priorities.”  “It is worth noting that this is the plan regardless of who wins the presidential election. If Trump wins, RAGA will likely feel emboldened; if Harris wins, it will be determined to try to stop her administration by any means necessary. As long as a conservative supermajority controls the Supreme Court, RAGA attorneys will always be one lawsuit away from changing the nation’s laws.”",Arrmadillo,2025-05-05T18:46:47,4
