And break up YouTube for censoring comments and removing dislikes.,BlackScienceManTyson,2025-04-17T11:26:28,32
Google needs to die.   They’ve become too big for their own good.  When was the last time you searched something and had good results? It’s all AI generated trash and scammers.,Just_top_it_off,2025-04-17T21:53:41,6
what crap.  cornering the market is not the same as a monopoly.,madonna-boy,2025-04-17T18:48:26,-5
"Alphabet needs to to have their ad network stripped away, search and owning the largest ad network is a huge problem.m, search and ads should **both** be stand alone, too many conflicts of interest.  YouTube should become stand alone too.    Too much centralized power over the  US and even the world.  They need the AT&T breakup treatment.",cliffotn,2025-04-17T13:49:58,15
Youtube uses the excuse that advertisers will leave if they don’t censor speech (since that terrorist video with ads stuff back in 2016) and it is a load of crap.  Alphabet hold all of the cards against the advertisers and the only reason they censor is because they want to. Their advertisers are mostly liberal and so they just play along and use it as an excuse for censorship of anyone they dislike.,Xander_hades_,2025-04-18T06:46:57,2
I mean… yeah that’s actually like the definition. We can argue about whether or not monopoly’s are harmful or not but I don’t think we can really argue about the definition of the term.,MacadamiaMinded,2025-04-18T07:16:39,2
