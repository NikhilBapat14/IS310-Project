"I've just decided not to buy anything unless it's necessary.  I have plenty of things to keep me occupied for the next couple years.  Lots of lumber for woodworking, huge backlog of video games, God knows how many books to catch up on, couple years of subscription time on streaming services.  I'll spend more for food I suppose, but I'm a pretty good cook who knows how to stretch my dollar and eat well in the process. I'll just eat out less.  So, I will not be making America Great again because I won't be participating in it's economy as much as possible.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-04-09T11:56:36,12

"Not to mention all the money lost in our 401ks in the last week/s. Far more than $4,000 and far more than the price of groceries. How many cartons of eggs could you have gotten for the amount your 401k lost? 5,000 cartons? 10,000 cartons of eggs? Is it really about the money?",ThisisBetty04,2025-04-09T12:04:45,10
