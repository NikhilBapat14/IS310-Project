"The immediate result will be the US bond market tanking.  Those show the perceived strength of the dollar, and a reason it is so strong is that the president can't fire the fed chair.  He goes, then US bonds will be sold as soon as humanly possible.    The reason Trump stopped the tariffs the last time was because Japan, which owns a trillion dollars in US bonds, was getting ancy.

Remember how Trump blamed his failure to stop covid  on Fauchi even though Trump did have the authority to fire him. ( Fauchi served at the pleasure of the president)   and yet Trump never even tried to fire Fauchi. Trump and the Republicans just blamed everything on him.      I suspect Trump is simply using the Fed as his latest excuse for the abject failure of the Republican Party to run the US economy.,Capital_Demand757,2025-04-19T06:36:19,47

"The perception would become that the office of the president now controls the Fed. Currently, the president can appoint the Fed chairman, but it remains independent of the Executive branch. This allows the president to put their 'stamp' on the economy, but allows the experts to do their job without worrying about politics. The moment that changes, the market will implode. The Fed is no longer a department controlled by experts in economics. It is now subject to the whims of whoever is in power. That is terrifying to everyone that studies, knows, or follows economics because the experts are not making the decisions - the changes will come from the white house.   Bottom line - the economy will be a mess, and the Fed becomes a pointless government branch.",Jccraig26,2025-04-19T06:02:05,28

Powell would likely ignore the firing and continue running the Fed as usual, arguing the termination is unlawful.  >2. Immediately, attorneys for the Fed, Powell, or possibly the Administration would seek an emergency injunction in federal court. This uncertainty around Fed leadership would trigger significant turmoil and volatility in financial markets.  >3. Regardless of how the district court rules, the losing side would appeal, pushing the issue to higher courts. Bottom line is that it would take months (at a minimum) to get a clear legal resolution",rose98734,2025-04-19T07:47:13,8

"The markets are wary of Trump's penchants for chaos, incompetence and personality meltdowns.  The tariff plan has marked him as an economic populist buffoon who is flirting with stagflation.  It isn't just the tariffs, but also the erratic unfocused manner in which he has attempted to impose them.    Accordingly, the markets are hoping that the proverbial adults in the room will keep Trump from going completely off the rails.  Those include treasury secretary Bessent and Powell.  If Powell leaves, the bond market will see a sell off and yields will rise.  It would show that Trump is out of control and in charge.    One reason that Trump wants Powell out is because he wants the Fed to cut rates.  The irony, of course, is that dumping Powell would have the opposite effect.",I405CA,2025-04-19T09:06:55,4

"Politically? Who the fuck knows anymore when nothing he does seems to faze his base or Congressional Republicans. They're clearly not thinking for themselves anymore.   Economically? We're completely and utterly fucked if he does this. The chair of the Fed being independent goes back to an era where we had to learn a lot of hard lessons about keeping economics away from politics. The economy depends on long term decisions made completely outside of the realm of politics and it also depends on predictability and confidence. Panic and pessimism kills an economy faster than anything else. This would be the straw that broke the camels back on Trump's completely unsound economic policy. Also, it's illegal.

"News reports keep saying laws passed by Congress created these independent agencies, but Congress passed those bills that were signed into law by the then sitting president. So if Trump fires any members of these independent agencies for reasons other than what’s specified in the law, he will be breaking the law himself. But with a lapdog Congress in his corner, he knows they will not hold him accountable by impeaching and removing him from office. However, if voters are pissed off enough to elect a sufficient number of Democrats and Independents to Congress during the midterm elections, he and other members of his cabinet can be held accountable for the illegal acts they have committed!",jmooremcc,2025-04-20T11:36:20,1

"The only reason Redditors don’t like the notion of President Trump firing Powell is because Trump is suggesting it.  I bought my first home when Paul Volker was the head of the Fed. My interest rate was 15 3/4%. There was not only bipartisan protests against Volker, there were also complaints in Europe.  Volker had some reason for keeping interest rates high; inflation was far higher then than it is today.  Those of you having a hard time qualifying for a home mortgage should know that Powell and Redditors defending him are not your friends.  It is damn tough trying to buy a home with high interest rates. I had arguments with my father who already had his home and was enjoying the high rates he was getting not only in money market funds but also in his checking account. He was getting 8% in his checking account.  The only good thing about high interest rates is that it lowers the buyer competition for a home and once the mortgage rates come down, your home skyrockets in value, you can refinance at a lower rate, pull some money out and your monthly payments will still be lower than they were before.  Use the refinance money to fix up your home or to buy a rental property!  Before you make an embattled hero of Jerome Powell think carefully about how high interest rates affect YOU.",baxterstate,2025-04-19T06:22:38,-14

The fact that you still have full faith that the system of checks will work is totally naive. How is a piece of paper going to stop Trump?  Law enforcement isn’t doing anything about it. The Supreme Court gave him immunity. And garland let him off the hook. Meanwhile he also ignored threats against the trans community while rushing to find the killer of Brian Thompson.

The FOMC votes for #3 from its members. The FOMC includes all members on the board of govenors plus presidents from regional feds.  #1 is the only title with for-cause protection under the federal reserve act.  #1 is also the least powerful title which Powell has.  Meaning, Trump can fire him as chair of board of govenors.  Trump would have to choose another govenor to be chair of board of govenors (or appoint a whole new govenor and chair).  Powell would remain a govenor. The FOMC could choose to keep Powell as chair of FOMC, or not.  The FOMC and board of govenors each control different aspects of monetary policy.

Congressional republicans made the political calculation that they should approve all of Trump’s nominees no matter how unqualified they are as any pushback could hurt them in upcoming elections. The reason Trump won is because the economy was bad, not because a majority of the country want to see immigrants get sent to El Salvadoran prisons. Sure, some of the hardcore base might love it, but if the economy is in ruins most people won’t care about immigration issues at all when they can’t afford to put food on the table.

So it will lead towards a tighter monetary environment.  Finally he is pro crypto but that really makes no difference to the fed.  Either case, Warsh reportedly told Trump not to fire Powell and just wait till next year to replace him when his term expires.    Warsh himself is competent but adverse to large public debts.

No Trump wouldn't but so was the narrative doctoring on tariffs.  Hoping to lower rates, well rotating the chairpersonship doesn't change the board votes ...

"Trump is at least half a billion dollars in debt, over his last administration he lost a third of his net worth.  He only made money by exploiting his position as president funneling public money and money from foriegn governments into his 'business' which is really his fathers, all he has done is hemorrhage his fathers wealth.   It now appears he thought he could use his position as president to force the world to bend to his will by using tariffs.  The problem is, Trump has always been a terrible business man and a complete moron and now hes senile.  The rest of the world is currently in the process of isolating the United States while Trump sundowns in a fit of anger.  The only corruption is the decay in Trumps mind and the Republican party who supports him.  People who want a mad King instead of a President, Fascism instead of a Constitutional Republic, you know...  Anti-American Traitors.",neverendingchalupas,2025-04-20T10:17:46,1

"The European Union just recently dropped their rate by 25 points.  It is NOT carved in stone that the rate shouldn't be dropped. That's a debatable point at the very least. I lived through and even bought my first home when rates were much higher and everyone was screaming at Paul Volker to lower them. I bet President Reagan would've loved to dismiss Volker.  Seems like either everyone who blanches at President Trump wanting to fire Volker are either Democrats who aren't going to like anything that Trump says or does or who hate that President Trump persists in saying the quiet part out loud.  Legend has it that President Lyndon Johnson privately said regarding the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution ""For all I know they were probably shooting at whales."" The story was that North Vietnamese Gunboats attacked an American warship and the American wardship fired back, giving President Johnson the pretext for a War in Vietnam needing a draft.  I'm sure other Presidents have considered the advantages in incorporating Greenland and Canada into the USA. President Trump has not filter and in my memory is the first to talk about it publicly.  Some find this sort of candor refreshing. I think a little discretion goes a long way. But it doesn't make President Trump automatically wrong.",baxterstate,2025-04-19T14:03:20,0

"It's less about Powell himself and more about the Fed's relationship to the executive branch. While fed chairs are appointed by the president, that's where the relationship formally stops.  If Trump violates the independence of the central bank and brings its operations within the sphere of political whim, we lose the expected stability our currency and bond operations are known for.",Shanknado,2025-04-19T02:11:21,20
