He's just tearing down the economy because he personally doesn't approve of it.  He actually believes his own lies...  Donald Trump is seriously one of the guys that read the World War II propaganda and he thought it was true.,Actual__Wizard,2025-04-23T11:45:09,20

"Equinor is thinking about suing. Norway owns 67% of the shares of Equinor. St√∏re and Stoltenberg, the prime minister and minister of finance, are meeting Trump Thursday.  Smells a little of the fart of the deal Trump style - setting up a difficulty to get leverage, saying you gave a lot when you just didnt take away. But Norway was one of the few that simply shrugged and said ""fine"" to tariffs, that were ok with buying U.S. goods for billions. We were the most easy going of ""partners"" - at least until this. The warships are currently off the table, we might just be buying European instead.  I'm wondering if the ministers will bring it up, or simply focus on global stability. They may not care about this fake stumbling block at all.",HelpfulPhrase5806,2025-04-23T12:06:14,1

"I blame the milquetoast DNC for this.    All they had to do was excite us more, and be bold.  They could have prevented the Trump disaster.   But they failed to earn our vote, like Bernie would.",insuproble,2025-04-23T11:44:43,-18

"I mean, while I also hate neoliberals, I have a problem with this example.  If someone is standing in a burning building, and someone tries to convince them to leave, and they don't, who is more responsible for that moron's death?  The moron, or the guy who told the moron to not be a moron?",Tech_Philosophy,2025-04-23T11:49:22,13

"After his first term, his lack of policy, his constant flip flopping, his talks on tariffs, his outstanding criminal lawsuits and being a freaking traitor. Droopy could have ran against this and should have won in a landslide.",Kihlshot,2025-04-23T11:58:49,0
