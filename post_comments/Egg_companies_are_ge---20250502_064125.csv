"I see the game being played:  >Yet while families have been squeezed by grocery sticker shock, agriculture corporations have been raking in record profits. Cal-Maine, the country’s largest egg producer, took in [$509 million](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/08/egg-prices-profit-increase-cal-maine/) this quarter alone, tripling its profits from a year ago.  >Gouging consumers is bad enough. But it gets worse: Cal-Maine and other ag companies were breaking the bank at the same time they were also quietly getting [millions in taxpayer-funded relief payments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/08/egg-prices-profit-increase-cal-maine/) from the federal government. Congress and the Trump administration must put a stop to this: No company that is getting corporate subsidies should be allowed to hike prices and extract windfall profits from American consumers.  >Exorbitant egg prices have [ostensibly](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/business/egg-prices-bird-flu-producers.html) been caused by repeated avian flu outbreaks in recent years. Or at least that’s the industry’s story. As the advocacy organization Farm Action [explained](https://farmaction.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Final_FarmAction_FTC_DOJ_EggPricesLetter.pdf) in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, over the last two years, some 115 million egg-laying chickens have been culled in response to avian flu outbreaks — a tragically large loss of animal life, but a relative drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of the country’s poultry industry. Even after this reduction in the country’s chicken supply, monthly egg production only dipped about 4 percent.",StreamisMundi,2025-05-02T07:44:24,101
