"This is an exclusive interview with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, where he speaks about the Democratic Party’s reaction to him hosting Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon. I’ll paste some excerpts below, but you should really just read the article because there’s a lot lol:  *“The reaction when I had Charlie Kirk and Bannon on was exactly to me Exhibit A of what I feel is wrong right now with my party: an unwillingness to even engage in platform, to listen,” the California governor said.*  *Democrats, he said, “wanted it to be a debate, take the guy down as opposed to, these two voices had a disproportionate impact on the voice you’re hearing every single day, in the megaphone in 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.”*  *“So maybe we should pay attention and at least express a desire to absorb and learn from what they’re doing and how successful they’ve been,” Newsom added.*  *“And so … I’m testing that,” Newsom said. “At the same time, I’m being tested by it, because the reaction has been a little more bumpy than I even anticipated.”*  *During the interview, Newsom was also asked about his thoughts on the electric rallies Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) have been holding across the country.*  *”It’s great. It meets the moment. It meets the zeitgeist, the energy,” the governor said. “It’s what people want.”*  *At the same time, Newsom cautioned that while the “energy is always” at the progressive wing of the party, he doesn’t think that energy alone can translate into a victory for Democrats during the 2028 presidential race.*",DevinGraysonShirk,2025-04-22T18:49:36,7

"He went yapping about how California is actually a flyover state or something.  I genuinely hate this man the most out of any semi-notable Democrats. More than Moulton, more than Crockett, more than Cuellar. He holds political ideas I hate, gets cowards who kept quiet about it to come out the woodwork, and is an idiot anyway. None of the people I mentioned are as ideologically opposed to me, as damaging, and as idiotic as he is.  At least I can be happy he likely shat on to many people to get nominated in 2028-and assuming he does, will get annihilated with such ease by Vance that me not voting for him won't matter (although I live in Florida, so it means little anyway).",IvantheGreat66,2025-04-22T18:57:50,3

They’re senators, they give speeches. Outdoor politicians are people that are out there in the field, they’re in the crowds.” Keep an eye on the ones outside.  Newsom is an indoor politician.

"Newsom is a snake in the grass.  He’s a corporate owned Democrat, hailiing from one of California’s Big Four families. Despite the media often portraying Newsom as a “far-left” radical, his positions are actually more moderate than nearly every other Democratic legislator in CA.  https://calmatters.org/politics/2019/10/gavin-newsom-moderate-governor-california-political-spectrum/  When he supports “liberal” legislation, he does it in a way that’s designed to increase divisiveness and actually harms the cause.  https://variety.com/2008/biz/opinion/yes-on-8-whethe-42518/  Peter Theil is an “old friend” of Newsom who has donated a lot of money to his campaigns and causes. Remember, Peter Theil is a billionaire Curtis Yarvin follower and backed JD Vance’s political career with a $15m dollar donation.  If you aren’t familiar with their ideology, look up Yarvin, his butterfly Revolution, and their whole Dark Enlightenment. Look at what DOGE has done and compare it to Yarvin’s RAGE plan.  https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2017/01/ca-gubernatorial-candidate-gavin-newsom-peter-thiel-is-the-least-of-democrats-2018-worries-108927  You may also be familiar with their ideas about network states. Remember that Trump proposed the idea of them last year, calling them “freedom cities”.  https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/03/politics/donald-trump-freedom-cities-flying-cars/index.html  Trump has gone on to meet with executives about them.  https://gizmodo.com/tech-execs-are-pushing-trump-to-build-freedom-cities-run-by-corporations-2000574510  Look at California Forever, which is one such site these tech billionaires want in California.  https://newrepublic.com/article/177733/billionaire-solano-california-tech-secession  He’s been a longtime ally of the big tech industry, vetoing legislation for AI safety. He was the mayor of San Francisco and involved heavily with defending the tech bros from legislation they didn’t want. These are the same people front-row at the inauguration.  https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/29/newsom-california-artifical-intelligence-regulations-00160519  https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/newsom-silicon-valley-ai-safety-00181776  Recently, he announced he sent his tech pals “special burner phones” to reach him anytime.  https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/newsom-ceos-burner-phones-00235044  Newsom issued a RTO order for state government employees, just like Trump.  https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/03/governor-newsom-orders-return-to-office/  Now he’s inviting far-right figures onto his podcast and is agreeing with them, going so far as to tell Charlie Kirk that his 13 year old son is a huge fan. Let that sink in. He’s basically saying that he is fine with his child listening to a far-right, white nationalist manosphere podcaster. He then agreed with Kirk’s view on transgender people in sports.  This is not an attempt to reach the other side. He’s doing this to try and push their politics to his left leaning audience by providing them with yet another platform to do so, and one belonging to a known “liberal” at that. They want to normalize these views, and propagandize even more people. He will slowly escalate his level of agreement in an effort to do it.  He’s now joining Trump in going after the coastal commission to weaken environmental protections. Keep in mind California is of interest to the CEOs he’s serving as potential “network state” sites.  https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/22/us/trump-newsom-california-coastal-commission.html  Last point-remember when Trump spewed that shit about “big, big surprises” and blue states “disappearing off the map next year”? This is all deliberate. Newsom has been working on behalf of these people for years.  https://dailyboulder.com/trump-says-blue-states-will-totally-disappear-off-the-map-next-year-promises-big-big-surprise/  And if you’re unfamiliar with the plan and still think Trump is a big old dummy, [I suggest you watch this video and get informed.](https://youtu.be/5RpPTRcz1no?si=LGafXTJWvy8n2cL0)",NegotiationExtra8240,2025-04-22T18:54:44,28
