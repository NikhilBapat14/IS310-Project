"Unspoken rule they can spend several $$$ on gender affirming care to look more like their gender, but nobody else can.",Kannazuki1985,2025-04-26T09:24:53,107
Shh..they are not really women  See: Stepford Wives by Stephen King.,bakeacake45,2025-04-26T11:47:32,22
"There is definitely a spooky uniformity to the look and manner of these frontline maga women.     Ech!!!!!  They remind of Hitler's ideal blond Frauleins, though more empowered for a more modern world, though still virulently sexist.  They're all white, pretty and heartless.     Leavitt--who i consider the most repulsive of all--is a dead ringer for the Reese Witherspoon character in Election (Tracey Flick).",Weakera,2025-04-26T12:18:28,19
"That’s despite the fact that both Trump and the MAGA movement are characterized by a vindictive, nostalgic, unapologetic misogyny. Some Trump supporters [openly fantasize](https://www.vox.com/culture/408578/trump-tariffs-incels-misogyny-email-jobs) about how his improbable promise of bringing manufacturing jobs to the US might drive women out of the workplace and force them to become solely wives and mothers, while [Trump himself has been found civilly liable for sexual assault](https://www.vox.com/politics/23696250/e-jean-carroll-trump-trial-sexual-misconduct-rape-allegations).",PapyrusKami74,2025-04-26T08:39:34,38
"As a POC it always enrages me to see these white elitist/racist types spewing hate for immigrants and POC and then turn around and spray tan, lip filler, high check bones, ass implants ect to make themselves take on features of the very people they hate.

"As soon as they start ""aging out"", which in MAGAt world, is about age 30, they begin to butcher their faces with bad plastic surgery, fillers, and injections. They have to keep their selling value up",LivingIndependence,2025-04-26T12:01:38,11

"Unspoken rule is they feel entitled to treat others like shit because they are treated like shit. They are second class citizens in a world of their own making. Bitter ass Karen’s would rather scream at a minority than ask for respect and equal treatment at home/church/work. Too bad it doesn’t help, they’re still bitter and miserable after.",SpotMama,2025-04-26T13:22:41,6
Bad hair extensions. Apparently they can afford the hair but not a good colorist to blend it. So ugly.,simplyannymsly,2025-04-26T11:08:21,11

"I always assumed they had special schools where they learn how to screech like banshees, and take lessons on how to say the most moronic thing possible, in the most idiotic way possible, while still somehow keeping a straight face as if they actually think people take them seriously.",Numerous_Photograph9,2025-04-26T15:50:39,3
Why are they examples? They aren't representative of the average MA GA woman in nearly any way. They have and will continue to have a wealth of resources under their direct control regardless of what EO's are ordered or laws are passed.,JennyAndTheBets1,2025-04-26T16:19:59,3

Small correction - Ira Levin wrote The Stepford Wives (he also wrote Rosemary’s Baby).  The 1975 movie is fantastic.,Miss_Behavior,2025-04-27T15:00:01,2

"Nothing makes me more perplexed (as a rare GenX white male middle class hetero liberal) when a Trump supporting rich white kid is walking down a hallway spewing gangsta rap.  Like, dude...not your experience at ALL.  I think MAGA FANTASIZES about being oppressed and this is all a cosplay that has gone way too far.",Big_Bookkeeper1678,2025-04-26T11:07:58,23

"I'm a big proponent of cosmetic surgery as a mental health treatment for genuine insecurities.  Reconstruction after injury, reshaping a disproportionate nose that got someone teased as a kid, facial feminization for trans women.  That's all well and good.  But at some point it goes from ""tasteful improvement"" to ""portrait of Dorian Gray stuffed with injectables"" and MAGA seems to lean far towards the latter.",Carbonatite,2025-04-26T16:26:01,17

"No, it's not exclusive to POC, but people like the Kardashians got all those surgeries to mimic the black stereotype...to be more appealing to black men. So while it's not exclusive, it is a valid stereotype that skinny white girls strive for. OP has a valid point.",BustAMove_13,2025-04-26T12:58:28,8
