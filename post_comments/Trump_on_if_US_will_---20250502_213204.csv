"> He halted the sweeping tariffs for most countries for 90 days to leave room for negotiations, but kept flat 10 percent import tax. Trump also escalated the trade war with China, hiking duties to 145 percent on all goods that come from the world’s second-largest economy.   - Tariffs  - Import tax  - Duties  Hey, The Hill.

If I knew it would not be a recession, I would have said so and bragged about it because I thought it was foolproof. If in some small chance it had failed, I would have blamed someone else.

He has no comprehension of what it means for other people. He thinks it's fine because it won't impact him and that other people will just have to take it on the chin.  Which means he will be so seriously surprised when people start to actively hate him in almost every circle of life and he finally starts to get very hard pushback against anything he wants to do.,Skastrik,2025-05-03T06:17:52,2
"Don't remember this being one of his campaign promises.  Maybe if people asked follow questions like ""how do you plan on ........."" it may have been headed off. But, and I know this is difficult for most of you, perhaps it's because most of you don't give a flying fuck until or unless it hurts you.  The society of ""fuck you, I got mine"" now wants a dig out. You may not all have voted for him, but for a nation bred on individualism, this was inevitable. Don't blame those that voted for him, or those that didn't vote at all, this is on the vast majority of you.  You woke up long after the point of no return.",Moonpig16,2025-05-03T07:13:11,2

Honestly I wish but the next best thing is shelf's being empty especially in rural and red states.   Most of his base doesn't have money in the stock market and lives paycheck to paycheck. Sure you have some that are filthy Rich and voted for him because they thought he would deregulate and cut taxes to save them money but most of maga is dumb trash.   It needs to hit them were it hurts and that's being able to afford or access basic goods.   His numbers are down even in red states because while they are slow they still have the ability to recognize one thing that everyone in this country understands and that goes across any party line and that's losing money and Access to things.   Lastly if you haven't seen he's mentally gone even fix news is making fun of this.,Festering-Fecal,2025-05-02T23:34:03,16
