There is nothing booker could actually do other than try to raise awareness.  Democrats have no real power right now so all they can do are these types of procedural moves.  The modern filibuster doesn’t even require a senator to do anything.  They can just say they put a filibuster on something like it was a hex or something.  This is how republicans stop progress when they are not in power.  It’s a broken system.  The filibuster shouldn’t exist really.  But a two party system shouldn’t exist either and neither should money equal speech but here we are.,JDogg126,2025-04-02T05:30:47,53
"The fillibuster has always been a symbolic way to get attention. You’re literally throwing a fit so no one else can have the floor and move business.  I’m impressed Booker used his time to talk about real issues and not just read a phone book like usual. And, frankly, the minority party is always dealing in symbolic power and gestures, but this seemed to break through. Regular non political friends and family asked me about it yesterday. I also think Booker is teeing up another run for president.   Any day the Dems control the news and they aren’t repeating Trump talking points seems positive. I agree in general though i’d like to see more fight and less gestures.",nyliaj,2025-04-02T05:31:29,28
"I think there are many times when awareness helps move something forward. Booker's filibuster is meant to light a match of public awareness to the fact that everything is not ok.  When you say it didn't create meaningful change, you have to ask if that was the intention. IMHO the intent is to start the process, or nudge along the process, of dissent.",RCA2CE,2025-04-02T08:07:10,9
They can. It is all about attention. How much media an action generates determines how many people see/hear about the action and form a opinion.,8to24,2025-04-02T06:16:49,6
"Absolutely not. Now the question is was what Booker did purely performative.   To take a stand and make the point that there is something you can do to to make change, even when it doesn’t seem possible isn’t performative.   If it inspires one more person to commit a hopeless act of objection, then it was worth while.   Try it sometime!",[deleted],2025-04-02T05:10:33,16

"The power Democrats have right now is the visibility and respect that congress with being a US representative. I can't tell you if the filibuster was the best use of what he's doing, but he's trying to bring attention to the severity of the moment, which is all i can ask.",Describing_Donkeys,2025-04-02T05:37:44,6
"This has been my point all along in this subreddit.    Whenever people here or in r/politics get all excited about some symbolic incident, like a really clever put-down, a big dramatic demonstration or protest, or something like this filibuster, I asked them to provide evidence of any concrete benefit that it produced.   And answer came there none.    I think it's entirely possible that in the last century things might have been different. The media was not so fragmented so people would get a clear and more consistent account. In the 1960s and 1970s at the height of the Civil Rights and anti-war movement, they were only three national TV networks that virtually everybody watched, and a handful of major ""newspapers of record"".   But we've had lots of major and dramatic symbolic events in the 21st century which in my opinion have produced no concrete benefit. So I'm still waiting for evidence that symbolic acts actually impact facts on the ground.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-02T09:53:00,3
"Yes. Absolutely. Rosa Parks not giving up her seat was symbolic and we still use it as a way of explaining the need for the civil rights movement and how disrupting normal every day events can lead to change. We should remember that the civil rights movement lasted more than a decade. A huge volume of symbolic actions were taken. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, almost a decade after the Rosa Parks protest in 1955.   Unlike activists, Politicians don't have to fight for a platform. By using their platform for symbolic actions, they can change history, just like activists change history with symbolic acts. It may take years, but it does make a difference.",Matt2_ASC,2025-04-02T10:32:14,3
"*when elected officials engage in it without backing it up with real policy moves, it feels like an easy way to appear engaged without taking the risks or doing the work needed for actual change.*  Politicians generally hang on to old tactics, fighting the last war instead of preparing for the next one.  Progressives specifically confuse talking or shouting about something with achieving a useful outcome.  They would rather advocate for a position, then lose an election and complain about losing, than change the subject to a different topic that could win an election.  I could see from the onset that Booker's target was Strom Thurmond.  But Strom Thurmond has been dead for ages and he came up in politics during an era when there was a filibuster and before there was social media.    Democrats need to find effective ways to build momentum and loyalty among the demos.  In this day and age, that usually means memes and soundbites and sometimes going low, not lengthy speeches.    Booker probably did well in turning himself into a primary candidate in 2028, but this isn't going to do anything to take down the current majority party and their president.  If anything, he cemented the skeptical view that Democrats talk and talk but don't get much done.  I say this as someone who can't stand the GOP and only votes for Democrats.  But I also studied political science, and it is painful to support a party that appears to have no understanding of the subject.",I405CA,2025-04-02T12:00:32,3
"Yes, they do.  Some of the most important actions in history have been symbolic. Humans are a very emotional species and symbolic actions help to galvanize those emotions around a particular action or ideology.  Whether *this specific* symbolic action will create real change, I have no idea. But the goal is to keep doing them until something sticks.",cromethus,2025-04-02T11:26:10,2
"Really insightful post! I think you’ve captured a key tension between symbolism and substance in politics very well. Symbolic gestures, like record-breaking speeches, can indeed raise awareness and spark public discussion, but as you pointed out, they only become truly meaningful when they're coupled with actionable steps and concrete policies. Holding politicians accountable means consistently tracking their follow-through—checking if their rhetoric translates into genuine legislative efforts or policy changes. Your hesitancy seems well-founded, and I appreciate you highlighting the importance of distinguishing between performative activism and actual progress. Thanks for sharing this thoughtful perspective!",AbsoluteReason,2025-04-02T12:30:57,2

Legislators have little power when not in power. The main thing they can do is try to rally engagment and support from voters. Symbolic actions are one of the ways they do that.,kittenTakeover,2025-04-04T14:47:23,2
"I'm in the UK and from our perspective, Democrats have gone completely silent since the election and there is no American political voice offering itself as opposition and alternative to Trump. That lack of political figurehead gives the impression that all the ordinary Americans who oppose Trump have just been abandoned. That perception of neglect kills off grassroots change but can be used by the right politician - just look how rapidly powerful Trump became in 2016 when he offered himself as a focal point for those who had long felt neglected. It also means that international politicians have no one to unofficially network with, making America even more isolated on the world stage.  Booker wasn't exactly headline news in the UK, but I'm still aware that he made this speech and kept his content focused on the people and issues he cares about. It's a first step towards countering that abandonment.",claireauriga,2025-04-02T05:52:40,3
"Did you know in 2013 Ted Cruz spoke on the Senate floor against Obamacare for 21 hours? Didn't change anything, funding for the ACA was unaffected.   The thing is, if you're not in power - and the Democratic party isn't - there is very little that politicians can do beyond giving speeches. This speech got media attention - that's better than most speeches, so it's a relative success.   In some ways it is even worse than you think. Giving speeches may build enthusiasm and energise people, but what actually matters is how well that energy converts into votes. An enthusiastic vote and an unenthusiastic vote count the same. An inspiring speech may make someone who couldn't be bothered to vote, vote. It might make people become engaged with their local communities and persuade people on the fence to vote one way. Or, even if it is highly praised, it might be preaching to the converted and change nothing. Value-above-replacement-action might be very small.   Tens of millions of people voted against Trump. It is fairly easy to fill concert halls with thousands of people who rally against him, and then feel like something is happening, that things are changing, that people are waking up, when it was the same voters as last time and nothing has changed. People want to be hopeful, I get that, but hope sometimes is an obstacle to action. The political process won't save us.",just_helping,2025-04-02T05:57:29,3

"I believe sometimes they can.  But they need to be laser focused and have enough voters behind them, preferable voters in other districts.     Democrats have the lowest approval rating on record.  and that's not just because (d) voters aren't happy with Trump enacting policy.  Its because swing voters and (R) voters want the policies that Trump is enacting.      If booker was laser focused, say just on getting national park rangers rehired, and nothing else, and he was able to get swing voters and (R) voters behind him,  that could absolutely be affective.",discourse_friendly,2025-04-02T09:51:40,1

"His speech wasn't a filibuster.  There was no bill on the floor.  It was a simple protest speech and rant by someone trying to get attention for himself.  The filibuster should exist to allow the minority party some little bit of power to stand up against a bill they believe to be harmful to the country.   Though I disagree with Senator Booker, I still applaud his tenacity and stamina to get his name in the record book of history.",bigdylan17,2025-04-02T06:31:12,-8
"Of course this was performative. But as you have pointed out, he didn't waste time reading Dr.Seuss books. He stood there and talked cogently about real world issues, about the problems our country has. That we're even discussing it here, that Xitter is flooded with memes about his filibuster, is objective evidence that he did move the needle.   For 8 years now we have watched Congressional Republicans (largely in the House) engage in openly performative behaviors, like submitting articles of impeachment in a President's first month in office, producing enlarged nude photos of that President's son in committee, a bill to put a President's face on Mt.Rushmore, and recently a bill to change the name of Dulles Airport to flatter the sitting President. These actions were odious. Not because they were performative, politics is inherently performative, but because these efforts weren't made to garner the attention of American voters, they were made to pander to the ego of one man.   Sen. Booker's effort will be dismissed by Republicans as a gesture, as grandstanding, as a waste of time. But I hope a few Americans will look at what he did and recognize that standing on the Senate floor talking, for 24 hours straight, no bathroom breaks, no meals, remaining cogent and coherent the whole time, was an act of endurance, and it fucking hurt. Booker was willing to personally suffer for awhile, just to make a point.

"In the short term on a purely tactical level yes.  But requiring a supermajority for any legislation **in addition to** having two houses of congress and presidential veto as checks and balances is sort of the lid on the pressure cooker that got us into this situation.   The party in power should have an ability to enact their agenda and suffer the consequences or rewards from the voters. The gridlock in Congress the last 50 years has led to Congress not legislating. Not truely. They write a bill and funding that says “idk the president and this executive branch department will figure it out. Here’s a semi blank check.” It’s how Trump **has** this huge ability to fuck with everything and now trying to go “eh I don’t think I’ll spend the check.”  The writers of the constitution did write about their decisions in the federalist papers. They considered requiring supermajorities for simply legislation and decided against it for gridlock reasons. And the simple fact is most of our worst examples of democracy dying is from gridlock and inability to do something anything until people got tired and went “fuck it lets just give all the power to this one guy. Its better being stuck unable to do anything.""  The Nazis only came to power after German didn’t have a government or parliament and had Hindenburg ruling by emergency decree due to no majority coalitions for like a decade. Rome actually only turned to emperors after 150 years of blocked reforms in the Senate between two political parties that had too many checks and balances blocking anything from being fixed.

Fair enough it was a protest speech.  But the filibuster has been undermining democracy ever since senators realized that no voting on something would allow them to kill bills without being accountable to voters.  The filibuster is not some construct of the constitution.  It is a byproduct of bad rules of order.  It should just take a simple majority for all legislation.

Republicans are working hard in at least 3 states to loosen child labor laws, to make up for the immigrants they're deporting in brutal ways.
