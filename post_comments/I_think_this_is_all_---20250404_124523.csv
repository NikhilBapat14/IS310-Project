"Hearing ""He'll shake things up"" nonstop since 2016 has turned me into the Joker, especially after these ai calculated reciprocal tariffs.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-04T12:47:49,8
"The carrot is always in front of everything he says. ""The economy WILL go boom."" ""Pain for now, profits later."" ""We WILL make America great."" Scholars and experts have better language than I, but this is and has been his strategy. Economic nirvana isn't coming folks. But the Dems, this is where you create another vision for our future. Trump Tariffs. He owns it.",BeerluvaNYC,2025-04-04T16:01:20,3
"Some dingbat was on fb parroting the ""it'll get worse before it gets better"" bullshit. He got fried in the comments. You know, a lot of people are barely hanging on now. They cannot afford for it to get worse.",BustAMove_13,2025-04-04T20:57:35,3

Republican recessions.  Vote R for Recession.  That's the cold hard truth. Every goddamn time.,Facehugger_35,2025-04-04T22:36:10,3
"This is exactly why I wish we had more younger and more energized leadership in the DNC. Even as a 12 year old back in 2006, I remember the Democrats actually get mean for once and leaned into populist anger, going after Dubya and The GOP for the War in Iraq/Afghanistan and the declining economy.  The Democratic party is literally being served with a huge midterm weapon to use, gifted by Trump and the GOP by not doing anything about the Tariffs. The time to take the gloves off and fight dirty was obviously a long time ago, but this is pretty much the biggest opportunity they have to do so tying something that will be universally unpopular to the GOP.  Trump is popular with his base and can get away with this, but the GOP is not popular and they can't get away with it as easily in 2026.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-04T16:06:43,2
"Yup exactly. It's because that's what the marching orders are from Donnie and Vance are, and what Fox news tells their audience. Trump is actually following through on tariffs because he knows his base is either too undereducated to understand, or that they'll just see it as ""growing pains and all part of the plan"". And that the GOP as per usual is too cowardly to push back, because they don't want to be primaried.  These people think it will only affect they thems, gays, blacks, immigrants etc, but rural Americans and the poor / lower middle class are the ones who also get the more negatively affected. They aren't immune to companies like Walmart raising prices due to Tariffs, or taking advantage of it as well just like what happened during COVID due to ""supply chain costs"". Hell everything is going to go up and stay up, again just like COVID.",Shadow_Strike99,2025-04-04T21:01:12,3
