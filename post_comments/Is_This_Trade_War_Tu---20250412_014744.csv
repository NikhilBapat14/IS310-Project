Could be.  These tariffs are very aggressive moves against China.  And China is responding tit for tat to US tariffs.  This could easily be the start of much colder relations normally seen in a cold war.,UnusualAir1,2025-04-12T07:07:09,19
"The Cold War 2 began pretty much the same time OEF/OIF (9/11) happened. It is a cyber-social war, one in which we are losing. It began with China brazenly stealing classified information and tech from the Pentagon and military contractors (Lockheed Martin has been hit numerous times by Chinese government hackers in the past 25 years) and moved to social engineering by creating divisive social and political memes (from both China and Russia), among other politically-related events.  What we are seeing now is just a flash-in-the-pan prelude to Cold War \*3,\* a financial war, as you suggest, that will definitely go full-blown if Trump keeps acting this way (which, given his history and mentality...).",Candle-Jolly,2025-04-12T10:38:39,13
"The Cold War was the Russians vs the West. Now that Trump has allied with Russia the cold war that is brewing is the West vs Russia and the US. The US is putting massive tariffs on countries that used to be American allies, like Canada, Mexico, the EU, and no tariffs on Russia. Trump is also withdrawing support for NATO.  Economically the US and China have had strained economic relations since China went Communist in 1949. China and Russia also have strained relationships. The US' trade war with China is welcome news to Putin and Russia.   It helps to remember that economically, Russia is much smaller than the US or China. Russia GDP is about the same as Texas, or somewhat over half of California. Russia GDP is about 12% of China's.  The old order in the Pacific was the US allied with Japan and South Korea, and more recently with Vietnam. Now those countries are looking towards China due to Trump's tariff attacks. The EU was also a close US ally but now they too are looking towards China and away from the US.   Putin may welcome Trump's efforts to weaken and isolate the US, but he might not have counted on China filling in the vacuum and reducing ties with Russia.",billpalto,2025-04-12T08:40:26,17

Possible. Everyone is saying “China can’t touch us with our military” but I think it’s pretty clear that China could bring a whole lot of damage and disruption to our lives with economic consequences versus combat. This just didn’t need to happen. Trump was arrogant and foolish and incompetent and now we have this big beast to wrangle.,ScarTemporary6806,2025-04-12T12:15:04,3
Trump folded already. Any hope of the US bringing manufacturing jobs was surrendered last tuesday in exchange for a 1 day bump to the stock markets and trump personal insider trading.

"You've been living in a New Cold War since at least 2008 when the country of Georgia tried to prevent its Russian-backed breakaway territory from, well, breaking away. Russia got involved in the first test of Putin's ""Anyone who speaks Russian anywhere in the world is a Russian"" Policy. Georgia was getting friendly with the West, there was talk of possibly folding it into NATO like several other Eastern European/Former Soviet state had been in recent years, and Putin wanted to draw a definitive line in the sand. Seven Years later he annexed Crimea and invaded the Eastern-most provinces of Ukraine, claiming the newly Pro-Western Government of Ukraine was oppressing Ethnic and Linguistic Russians. Bush, Obama, Trump (rather the momentum of US Foreign policy as it continued under his first admin), and Biden all tried to contain and control Russia through soft and less-soft diplomatic means-- Sanctions, international pressure, making them a pariah state, and ultimately banning them participating from most international (non-political) organizations. The War in Ukraine has been a proxy war between Russia and the West for 11 years now, one that only openly turned hot in 2022 with opening of the war in earnest.   The World and its political blocs are realigning right in front of you. The world you grew up with is dead and disappearing into the distance in your rear view mirror. Domestically, even if there are free and fair elections in three years and a Democrat is elected, the United States is never going back to the way it was. The GOP plan is to ""fix"" everything so that its ""the way its supposed to be"", and do so so-quickly and so-violently that any attempt to move the pieces back where they should be will take too long and be a fools errand. Internationally the American Dollar's command over the global economy is being rapidly eroded as nations like Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates are all colluding to divorce their economies, and the international trading order, from the Dollar. Europe is forging its own military, diplomatic, and trade policies free from considerations of the USA and its administration. The World Order that has existed, and benefited, the USA since the end of the Second World War is at an end. It is a Brave New World and you need to see that the world around you has already changed irrevocably. You need to find a way forward because there's no going back.",Fofolito,2025-04-12T12:18:56,2

"Things *will* settle down when new treaties are signed. But they won't be between the US and folks. They will be between *China* and the EU. *China and pan-Pacific nations. *China* and African nations. Etc etc etc.  I saw a talking head last week lay out the new normal. The US and China are on a level field now. But they have different trajectories. China is in ascendence, and the US is in decline. *Before* so-called ""Liberation Day"".  Before folks @me into oblivion, think about two things. One a definite fact, the other admittedly supposition:  Fact- After Trump’s idiocy in trying to force the world into a supine position, Japan has been shedding its massive amount of owned US debt. Quite a bit of it.  Supposition- Dependent on the extent of Japan's overall reaction to a now undependable/unstable US financial environment, are they still the world's largest holder of US debt? Or is that position now held by China?  I saw a thumbnail on YouTube from The Bulwark, ""The American Age is Over,"" or some such. It was what I thought hyperbolic ass hell at the time. Now? Not so much.",onikaizoku11,2025-04-12T13:29:12,2
"The United States has been the sole superpower since the Fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, The People's Republic of China isn't an economic threat until a few weeks ago.  However, the United States still maintains the Policy of Containment around the People's Republic of China with major US military installations spread throughout the Indo-Pacific in South Korea, Japan, The Philippines, Australia and New Zealand acting as a layered military, economic and political defense network around China.   The Chinese is NOT peer-to-peer with the United States except in economics and technology while China is politically, militarily and culturally Isolated for now. The United States is the sole superpower because it dominates in every single continent with powerful regional alliances. China doesn't even dominate East Asia; its own region, how would that make them a superpower? It contends with India, Vietnam, South Korea, Japan Australia and New Zealand with enormous political, economic and military backing from the United States. Vietnam, a socialist state has openly aligned itself with the United States.  North Korea is a hermit in stagnation for decades, the Russian Federation is a declining power with outdated technology, industries, infrastructure and lacking competence and Iran is trapped by the United States in the Strait of Hormuz with all the Gulf States on side with the United States.  The United States unlike China has global military, economic, technological and political influence in major international institutions. The United States Navy with its eleven nuclear-powered aircraft carriers acts as the premier security provider for all commercial sea trade to ensure freedom of trade and movement controlling vital routes for China in the Strait of Malacca that of which 80% of her oil comes through. If the United States wanted it could crush the Chinese through preventive measures in the Strait of Malacca causing China to enter into an energy crisis.   The Russian Federation and Kazakhstan combined cannot supply China with enough oil and natural gas demands for their industries and military. China's Strategic Energy Reserves only would last them at best 18 months to 2 years. The Belt and Road Initiative is decades away from completion Energy infrastructure between China and Iran requires cooperation of the Central Asian States meaning China cannot make aggressive decisions.   There isn't going to be a Cold War, if the United States maintains the status quo with its regional and global alliances intact, the United States shall continue to dominate as the sole superpower.   If there is to be a Cold War, it requires China to get South Korea and Japan to completely pivot towards China allowing them nearly complete reign in East Asia and the End of Containment procedures enacted by the United States. The United States would be humiliated internationally forced to shore up its other alliances in the region to counterbalance China, or face an Asia under the Gold and Red Banner.   This scenario would be a devastating blow to the United States as its global reach is significantly diminished, US allies start questioning whether the United States can maintain its influence and keep the status quo from breaking into a thousand pieces.",UnityOfEva,2025-04-12T13:43:04,2
"China has been a dishonest player in world markets for decades now. They have never internally respected or enforced US or international copyright laws, or intellectual property rights. They have habitually engaged in state sponsored corporate espionage and used protectionist policies (like tariffs), to foster the growth of their domestic industrial and technology sectors. The US has very legitimate gripes about China's behavior in international trade.  Trump's insistence that the trade deficit in goods between the US and China presents harm to the American economy, is empty nonsense (either openly dishonest, or just stupid). The numbers he quotes are entirely predicated on trade of goods and ignores trade in services. Services make up around 76.4% of the US GDP (professional services, real estate, finance, software, healthcare, etc.), and are the largest portion of US exports to China, making the trade deficit a great deal smaller than Trump is claiming.   A Cold War is a period of ideological tension and political rivalry between nations, usually without direct military conflict. In that sense, it seems that yes, the US is in a cold war with China. Donald Trump may see his tariffs as a tool in that indirect conflict, but none of his rhetoric explicitly says so. If the tariffs are meant to have that purpose, they're failing miserably, while harming American economic stability. They're also driving away our allies and forcing them to reassess their trade relationships. Most notably, South Korea and Japan (American allies), have announced they will be cooperating with China, to counter what they view as exploitive and harmful American trade policy. This is a massive tidal shift in global relations, and one that is deeply harmful to American interests. It's frightening that Trump and his administration do not seem to see that reality.   Russia's expansionist war in Ukraine has become a proxy war for the global tensions between Western partners (The US, Europe, Uk, Canada), and Eastern partners (Russia, China, North Korea, Iran). Trump's removal of US support for Ukraine, is capitulation in that conflict. If this is indeed a cold war, it has to be asked; Why does Donald Trump seem determined to lose it for the United States?",BluesSuedeClues,2025-04-12T10:00:11,2

"""Cold War"" isn't quite the term that I would use.  That was a protracted conflict that occasionally came close to becoming a hot war.  This Trump disaster will likely fizzle out fairly quickly.  The rest of the world is pushing back while the negative impacts are already becoming apparent to Americans.  Trump will likely create an offramp of sorts for himself by declaring victory even though he will have failed.  The long-term problem is that Trump has established that the US can no longer be trusted with its position of dominance.  Even if the next president is a smart Democrat who works overtime to undo much of this nonsense, other nations will probably be wary of the risks of another populist president flushing everything down the toilet.    The damage will be more of a slow erosion of power than a grinding conflict. When the dollar loses reserve currency status and skepticism of US treasuries as a risk-free vehicle becomes permanent, then we are truly screwed.  This would probably happen at some point, regardless, but Trump has put US decline into the fast lane.",I405CA,2025-04-12T21:53:18,1

"This is good, I would only add that although ""China and Russia also have strained relationships"", they have begun cooperating militarily since Russia invaded Ukraine. China is currently sending military aid to Russia, mostly in the form of munitions and computer chips. Russia in turn, is believed to be helping China advance its submarine technology.   This is part of the larger pattern of Russia, China, and North Korea working together to oppose American interests in Asia and the pacific. While Russia may welcome Trump's efforts to undermine NATO and align the US with Russian interests, Russia shows no interest in changing any of its global positioning and strategy to align with American interests.

"Wall Street isnt the U.S. economy.  The tens of millions of American businesses are the U.S. economy.  We live under global trade with a consumer economy, you dont strengthen the U.S. economy by weakening the U.S. dollar.  Because then people have less money to purchase goods and services...

He is actively, illegally, gutting government programs the majority of the country relies on sky rocketing cost of living, which reduces spending and increases consumer debt.  So more poverty, more crime...  These create their own costs.  Trump and the Republican Congress are increasing monthly government deficit exponentially, the new budget calls for 4.5 trillion in deficit increase for a 4.5 trillion dollar tax cut to the 1%.  Government debt and deficit will increase far beyond anything imaginable under a Democratic administration.  Trump with a complicit Republican Congress has sent the U.S. straight into a recession, very likely a depression, or just simply a total economic collapse.  Hes trying to temporarily walk back his tariffs when foriegn states are moving away from reliance on the U.S. as an economic power.  I am not sure what the rationale was, but its obviously failed.
