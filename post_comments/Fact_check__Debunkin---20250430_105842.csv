"What a monumental job it would be to be a fact checker for Trump's lies. He is in a spot now though, of his own making, where he can't really lie his way out. He will try of course and today has blamed the slowing economy on Biden. But the consequences of the tariffs will be glaring soon with empty store shelves and rising prices. Even the dumbest of his cult followers will notice prices going up.",joekerr9999,2025-04-30T11:15:26,3

"In you're in tech, it's like we're in ""agile development gov't"" and just finished a sprint? And now shipping a 1/2 baked product as the dev team finds excuses to move pos-its to the right ""done done column"", lol. This is very common in tech using 'agile'.  and it appears everyone's now on a death march to get one deal one for the next sprint.",johndsmits,2025-04-30T12:28:24,1
"You know at this point I don't know if he's lying because he lies or because his staff is so beholden to him and being in his good graces that they can't tell him the truth.  And then he just repeats what they tell him because he's senile.   I mean look at that last ""interview"" about the MS-13 photo.  He's not that good of an actor and I really think he was convinced that that was true.  I want to say he's just a puppet for these people pulling his strings but I don't think he knows what the truth is anymore and no one's going to tell him and if they do tell him he's not going to believe them anyway.   Man it's like having a toddler who's senile running this country.  And I say running but I meant ruining.",cumbersome-shadow,2025-04-30T16:34:28,1
