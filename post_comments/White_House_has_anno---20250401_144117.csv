"One thing that is troubling is that they're trying to spin this as a tax break. Tariffs add to the cost of product so the cost of goods will go up. The consumer takes the pain for ""Liberation Day"" for the rich. The purpose of the tariffs and the DOGE cuts is to free up the budget for the tax cuts for the wealthy. The working class is going to get screwed one more time.",joekerr9999,2025-04-01T14:49:39,565
"Trump has always been better at picking words to make people feel a certain way than at picking policies to make reality a certain way.  ""Liberation Day"" is a vibe, not an accurate description.  Speaking of ""certain blocks that may well coordinate retaliation"", China announced that they will be coordinating retaliation with South Korea and Japan, and neither other country has disagreed (although they've only publicly declared that they want fewer trade barriers).  If you know the history of those 3 countries, the fact that they're even considering coordinating on this is a sign of how badly Trump is miscalculating.",Umber_Gryphon,2025-04-01T14:52:50,163
"If the “Liberation” they’re referring to is our being liberated from meaningful economic entanglements with our allies and the world at large, then it isn’t a misnomer. Technically.   We are also being “liberated” from a strong economy, stabilizing inflation, and low unemployment. Which, I suppose, if you consider us being prisoners of those things, you could say we’re being liberated.   There’s really no positive or good faith way to frame this one. ",tyrannosaurus_r,2025-04-01T14:48:17,293
He's liberating us from our retirement accounts and jobs. Manufacturing won't come back quick enough in any meaningful way to offset the tariffs.   The only two reasons I can imagine for doing this is to either cause a recession to allow the rich to buy up capital at an insane discount and/or cause riots that can be quelled using aggressive force that will then be allowed to continue on beyond the initial rioting in perpetuity.  EDIT: I guess the third reason could be that he wants to accelerate the ushering in of the Chinese century of prosperity by causing our allies to shift their trading needs to China/alternate nations lol,BirdsOnMyBack,2025-04-01T14:54:47,116

He intends to liberate the American middle and lower class from all of their money.   The title of the day is appropriate - just not in the way they mean it,Duckney,2025-04-01T14:58:14,38
"Various nations have already moved to respond to the tarrifs in blocks, notably China, South Korea and Japan. Given that Trump's tarrifs will be applied to all countries, I imagine similar block responses will occur, especially with countries already belonging to economic or political groups such as the African Union. So right away, bilateral deals are out the window. I don't think Trump really has the political cover to outlast any of these blocks, even if they are harmed more by the tarrifs and reciprocal tarrifs in the shortrun.  In reality, I think that what will end up happening is that all of this is going to benefit China. It will force the EU to militarize and thus increase their industrial capacities. It increase the importance of the African Union and their member nations, perhaps being taken with more urgency for relations with the EU. And it will make it so that nations will look to replace American dependencies overtime, which will make Trump's hand weaker over time, especially when Trump is facing a harsh recession entirely of his own doing. I think that Trump could spin the cause to his own base, but he won't be able to spin it's persistence. Nor will he be able to spin the high prices on basically everything and the speed in which those prices manifest.",fireblyxx,2025-04-01T15:00:42,27

"It's extremely telling that the trumpists can't find a single accredited economist who is willing to torch their reputation and claim that these tariffs are anything other than catastrophically harmful for the US economy.  There is no identifiable upside to them.  With most of the objectively-bad things trump has done and continues to do, at least there is some sort of twisted benefit to him personally.  Mass tariffs are an unambiguous loss for *everybody*.  The only plausible explanations are that either A) crashing the US economy is in fact the goal for whatever reason, or B) trump really has lost his mind and is deep in the throes of dementia.  There is no 3rd option.",candre23,2025-04-01T16:08:45,20
"Trump should be fairly easy to understand.  He is a bully who was raised by his father to believe that the world is comprised of winners and losers.  [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trump-the-bully-how-childhood-military-school-shaped-the-future-president/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/trump-the-bully-how-childhood-military-school-shaped-the-future-president/)  So Trump does not believe that win-win deals are possible.  Someone has to lose and the winner prevails at the expense of the loser.  His fondness for autocrats suggests that he admires them for their disrespect for collaborative small-l liberal values.  He is not particularly ideological, so this leaves us with someone who is more of a mob boss than a fascist.  Accordingly, he is a maximalist negotiator.  Instead of trying to meet in the middle -- only losers do that -- he makes unreasonable demands in an attempt to get everything that he wants.  But there is another side of bullying: They tend to respect those who can beat them.  The maximalist will keep demanding and demanding, then collapse at the last minute if they can't get what they want.  If the US wanted to add military forces to Greenland, it could easily do so while complying with its agreements with Denmark and Greenland.  That is not what Trump wants.  He wants to bully his way into a minerals deal because it won't feel like a win unless the Danes and Greenlanders lose.  The best way to deal with a maximalist is to give up nothing.  The best way to deal with a media hype machine such as Trump is to troll him back so that he looks like a loser and a failure.  If the EU was wise, it would put together its own minerals deal with Greenland so that the US is locked out of it.  A Danish delegation should be sent to the US in order to ""investigate Signalgate"", which will leave the delegation very disappointed with the incompetence of the administration (as will be explained to the media and on social media.)  A side trip to Ohio would highlight the White House's neglect of the needs of the region.  This could be topped off with a meeting with the Canadian PM in which they can both commiserate about the sad turn of events.  Trump tries to write the headlines and make everyone else dance to his tune.  That game has to be played in reverse.  He will slip when his fans begin to tire of him, but they need to see him as a loser who isn't so tough and smart, after all.",I405CA,2025-04-01T15:52:04,48

"Almost every paid and worthwhile analyst has looked at this idea and laughed at for what it is... terrible policy that will hurt middle class and poor Americans, and do nothing to help anything in the short or long term for working families.  Long term, it could destabilize our economy and make us an international pariah, with long term allies no longer willing to give us the benefit of the doubt, empower China to out pace us economically, and drastically reduce American influence in the rest of the world.  In short, it is exactly the sort of move that Putin, and enemies of the United States want desperately to happen.  The fact that Trump dresses up disastrous and terrible decisions with pageantry and literally double speak, where obviously bad things for the majority of Americans are hailed as good things... is the most disturbing aspect of this most recent White House resident. When drug prices go up people die. When food costs go up, people starve, when importing goods prices go up, businesses go under, when trade volume drops, people lose jobs and become homeless. When people become homeless, crime rates and drug use skyrocket. ***IF you are poor or lower middle class, Trump's moves will push you into the street, and kick you in the face.***  One thing is also quite certain. Most Americans *do not agree with this move*, even many who voted for him are dumbfounded by it, believing it was a bluff or just 'tough talk'. The same goes for his continual obsession with Greenland, a territory with almost no strategic value, and certainly far less economically important as our agreements with China who is on the verge of going on a scorched earth campaign that will ruin Americans lives. Americans are also confused by his strange anger towards Canada, a country that has never been on anyone's radar for revenge or grief.  A theory started recently is that the president is being maneuvered to cause as much pain and suffering as he can legally inflict without his main supporters in congress and the senate and the supreme court people realizing what He is actually doing, attempting to start large scale protests in major American cities, until it is too late.  He could then then use Martial Law to arrest thousands of local politicians, lawyers, and other malcontents, claiming they are inciting insurrection, treason, with the aim of sending them to jail, stripping them of their civil rights, and crippling any political opposition to his continued rule. Cloaking his actions under the guise of 'law and order' for mass media consumption, this would enable him to 'run' for a third term, and abolish any protections from the constitution, turning the United States into a Oligarchic structure run by a rotating cabal of powerful un-elected industrialists and billionaires, that would extend well past his death. This American Empire, would no longer resemble a Republic, but be more closely modelled on the Nazi Regime.  While these all may sound like fever dreams, when you listen to his most ardent supporters, and read the ideas from Project 2025, it becomes apparent that destroying any possibility of a healthy political opposition is the number one goal of the second Trump term.",orionsfyre,2025-04-01T15:13:18,42

"Is Liberation Day a misnomer? Undoubtedly. The theory behind the tariffs is to encourage a return of manufacting jobs to America. This will take years.

"I think there are a couple of things at work here. Trump has discovered that tariffs are a way he can threaten economic harm to other countries and there is nothing anybody can do about it. It doesn't require an act of Congress, no laws need to be passed, and he is in complete control of whether and when to cause the damage.  Trump thrives on this kind of power. Only he knows what he is going to do, everybody else is left guessing and in chaos.  What is Trump doing with this unilateral power? He is threatening and attacking US allies.  Our closest allies, like Canada, Mexico, and the EU are the main targets. My reading of this is that Trump doesn't want to be allies with anybody except Russia.  The other thing that is happening is that tariffs are a consumption tax. Trump wants to eliminate the income taxes, that hit the richest the most, and shift the tax burden to the middle class and below. Tariffs as a consumption tax does that. Things like food, housing, automobiles, and all kinds of consumer goods will be more expensive; the money going into the US Treasury will be coming from things that everybody consumes, instead of taxes on income which hits the rich.  Oligarchs are definitely in favor of this unless the tariffs hit their own industries. As an example look for Elon Musk to get a waiver on Tesla automobile tariffs.",billpalto,2025-04-02T07:36:54,2

There's the roughly 3,000 parts to make the car, the roughly 30,000 components that make those parts, and the raw inputs to make those components.

">The purpose of the tariffs and the DOGE cuts is to free up the budget for the tax cuts for the wealthy.  This has to be pointed out each time tariffs come up.   Increased costs due to tariffs disproportionately affect people with lower incomes because they spend most of their income each month. Rich people spend only a fraction of their income each month, so increased costs will only affect a fraction of their income. And they get a tax cut to make up for it. Effectively, the revenue that is lost due to tax cuts for the rich will be replaced by tariffs that disproportionally affect people with lower incomes.  Everything else, all claims of ""getting jobs back"" etc., are distractions and lies.   The thing is, if you implement tariffs, other countries will retaliate. At best, you will lose jobs in industries that manufacture goods for trade (and that were competitive on the world market w/o tariffs in other countries), and replace them with jobs in industries that produce goods for the home market, and that are only viable with protectionist tariffs.",Enibas,2025-04-02T00:38:24,4

"It makes sense when you consider why they are doing this. Trump's 2017 tax cuts were set to expire during his current term as both a poison pill for his successor (assuming a consecutive term) and because the CBO requires budget neutrality over 10 years to use reconciliation (no filibuster / cloture) to pass a bill. It is worth noting that these tax cuts only expired for lower income individuals, not for high income people and corporations. It was meant to kick the can beyond his term but then he landed in the oval office in the time period. So they have to scramble a bit.  They can give themselves a monstrous tax cut and potentially extend the existing ones if they can extrapolate a revenue line out 10 years based on the tariff revenues before the tariffs cripple the economy. They also want to have Elmo and his chainsaw cutting spending so they can extrapolate out lower spending, too.   Once they get their huge tax cut through the CBO and reconciliation, they can drop the tariffs and rehire a lot of workers (so they think) and walk away having fiscally fucked us all for the next decade by robbing the government of revenues.

If you talk to military people, they know where it would be smart to cut things - they're often politically unpopular. For instance there's a bunch of navy ships based on Florida at a base that's too shallow to support the maintenance facilities they need - when they need maintenance they have to sail up to Norfolk. Just rehoming those ships out of Florida would save a bunch of money - but it'd also move something like 15000 families out of Pensacola immediately which would devastate the local economy - any rep whose district depends on a military base will oppose that change.  Similarly, the navy has 11 carrier strike groups - I've heard estimates that they only need 9 to adequately meet their mission objectives. (At the same time, they could add a few destroyers and submarines to help with forward projection if needed). Mothballing a carrier strike group or two would be a massive change, but similar negative consequences to their home port.

I suspect he thinks they're bigger than they are because he's not bright and doesn't understand how maps work.  >  The outward hostility to all of Europe?  Again, no clue. Even the Bush years didn't have this level of nonsense.  > Can you point me to when the Greenland thing started?   For Trump? 2019. That appears to be when he caught wind of it.    Prior to Trump, we've known Greenland to be a bit of a security problem for us for decades before Trump was even a known entity.  The coastline is difficult to monitor, and [is a ""security black hole""] (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-change-greenland-security-ins/as-the-arctics-attractions-mount-greenland-is-a-security-black-hole-idUSKBN2750J6/).  American history is littered with attempts to purchase Greenland.  If I had to guess, Trump sees land acquisition as a legacy builder, and succeeding in Greenland where others, from Seward to Eisenhower, failed, is enticing.    > The entire smoke screen of Doge and the gutting of various social safety net programs including ones that even many of his supporters don't approve of gutting?  This was laid out fairly explicitly in Agenda 47. Love it or hate it, this is what a plurality voted for.  > I'm not saying He doesn't have agency, but many of his actions smack of the exact thing an enemy of the Country would be interested in the US doing.   Respectfully, that might be a perspective issue more than anything else.  The conservative right has wanted massive cuts in government for generations, the security wing has often seen issues with Greenland's ability to defend itself against foreign invasion.  That Trump is not adept enough to accomplish these things without unquestionable chaos and questionable legality is a real problem.  ""Everything I don't like is Russian"" is a way to approach issues, for sure, but it starts from a conclusion as opposed to leads anyone there.  I suspect a lot of people didn't even realize prior to 2025 that our desire to bring Greenland in as American territory goes back 150+ years.",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-02T10:21:28,2
Tariffs don't apply to domestic products by definition.  It is so obvious I didn't think it needed to be said.,GravitasFree,2025-04-02T09:34:24,-2
"Well, all I know is that when someone makes all the moves that a foreign adversary wants them to make... weakening international cooperation, threatening to pull of out strategic and long term defensive agreements and alienating literally every nation on the planet with no real long term plan at all... it's not hard to see why some people might get there.  Acquiring Greenland might be a long term goal of US Expansion and protectionism, but doing so with such blunt and naked buffoonery as they have been doing is the worst option.  It's not all that conspiratorial when you can literally lay out each step and see how it impacts US interests to even laymen and relatively uninformed people. It's not just us 'normies' on the metaphorical street saying this. These accusations are coming from foreign policy experts and former high military personnel who also feel he may be responding to or cooperating with well-monied foreign interests.  When someone acts step by step in a pattern that matches enemy foreign interests... it doesn't really matter what the origin of said sabotage is. The effect is just as devastating.  Put it this way, if a parent neglects a child and two observers argue if the parent is on drugs, does that matter? The neglect is still the most important issue.",orionsfyre,2025-04-02T11:43:14,3
"Most domestic manufacturers use massive amounts of imported materials and parts. It's the tariffs on those that I assume you were expecting them to eat.       Except for cottage industry products like coffee mugs and placemats, there is very little domestic manufacturing that does not rely heavily on the import of materials or parts, and those are subject tariffs.",Independent-Roof-774,2025-04-02T09:44:22,2

You're assuming a lot, namely that everything you don't want to happen is the desire of a foreign nation.  I could just as well argue that China loved Biden overspending because it puts us in a more precarious financial solution, and I would be rightfully laughed out of the room if I called him a Chinese stooge because of it.  > Put it this way, if a parent neglects a child and two observers argue if the parent is on drugs, does that matter? The neglect is still the most important issue.  Sure.  But that raises the question as to why it's so important to talk about the drugs/Russia instead of the neglect/Everything Happening..",ClockOfTheLongNow,2025-04-02T12:33:22,2
