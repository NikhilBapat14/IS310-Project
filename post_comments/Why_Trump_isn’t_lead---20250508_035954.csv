Trump is a do nothing president. Won't be surprised if he think about real estate deal when Pakistan get nukes. He will probably also wanna rename it Trumpistan and make their government building a big beautiful Trump tower....,NorthenFreeman,2025-05-08T04:05:45,13
"Maybe Donald will chime in with some, ""This should have never happened. If I was President, this would have never happened. On day one, I'll sit down with them and end this fighting.""",30mil,2025-05-08T04:05:09,8

"Probably because it only involves two lots of brown people.  They're both nuclear powers, though, so just be grateful that he's not involved.",AINonsense,2025-05-08T04:05:32,6
Because he can't find either of them on a map and has the diplomatic skills of a 55 year old mutiple divorcee on his fifth drink of happy hour as he works up the courage to make a move on a group of equally divorced women on a girls night out in vegas?,Mein_Bergkamp,2025-05-08T04:17:55,4

"Two reasons: they don't give a fuck about him, and he doesn't give a fuck about them.",Hairy_rambutan,2025-05-08T04:28:52,4
He does not care.,mangoserpent,2025-05-08T04:39:49,4
"Easy question to answer.   Because Trump doesn't give two shits in his pants about a bunch of brown people killing each other, or really anyone other than himself.",Grey_Matter_121,2025-05-08T04:51:02,3

"He will blame Biden for allowing the Taliban to take over the country so quickly.  We're all aware that's Afghanistan, but I think he doesn't know the difference.",clueless_in_ny_or_nj,2025-05-08T05:30:27,2
It's Biden's fault.,edfiero,2025-05-08T04:57:14,1
He can't even point those countries on a map. And they are not white...,NorthenFreeman,2025-05-08T04:19:37,4
"He is, but that is not a good answer to this question. Because he has a lot of people that are corrupt as hell but not actually stupid whispering plans in his ear, and he does a lot of those.  So we can reasonably determine that the reason he is doing nothing about this situation now is because the people whispering in his ears plan to profit from it.",Deinosoar,2025-05-08T05:14:33,2
Depends on if there are any nice golf courses there.,edfiero,2025-05-08T04:58:31,2
