"I was looking for a loophole hoping this was a clickbait.  It wasn‚Äôt.the birthright citizenship hasn‚Äôt been waived and ‚Äúdeporting‚Äù US citizens because of their undocumented parents is absolutely disgusting, especially considering they are minors and with complex medical needs.  The undocumented adults I suppose it is a bit tricky to justify. But you cannot extradite a US citizen!! What the hell.",Illustrious_Cut1730,2025-04-26T18:27:46,13

"[‚ÄúDeporting citizens‚Äù is actually called abduction or kidnapping because U.S. citizens are outside the scope of job definition for ICE, Border Patrol and military transport. It also isn‚Äôt classified as arrest. This magically converts ICE, Border Patrol and military into not immune from prosecution, and the military pilots are violating posse comatatus each time a citizen is flown out of the country. I hope the next president isn‚Äôt functionally illiterate on this topic.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385)",nanoatzin,2025-04-26T17:49:38,56
"Shout this from the rooftops.   Call out ALL your local news orgs for calling this 'deportation'. ITS NOT, and to label it as such is to move away from the Society of Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics in Reporting.

"Further, which isn't discussed in this article, the father has legal status. Per ICE's own written directives, they are mandated to coordinate care with family or caretakers for minors (legal or not) instead of detainment. They made no attempt to do this. They let the mother talk to the father for less than a minute and then hung up the phone.   The father's lawyers filed an emergency petition for her to be released into his custody, but the government showed up in court with a letter they claim was written by the mother saying she was taking the child with her. The judge was aware the deportation flights was already in the air, but required the government to get her on the phone when she landed to verify she wrote that letter. The government called back later that afternoon with a claimed oopsie, oh well. They missed her and she was already released in Honduras.",undercurrents,2025-04-26T20:06:02,7

Annnndddd, the kids are United States citizens that deserve to remain in the US - they are NOT and CAN NOT be deported. They‚Äôre citizens.

"That's not what happened in one of these cases. First, the mother and sister were arrested literally at their regular check-in at Immigration. They were following the law. The 2 yr old with cancer was with them, so all three were taken into custody.   Per ICE's own written directives, it mandates coordination for the care of minor children with willing caretakers during detainment. The father of the child and other family members have legal status. But they gave the mother less than one min to call the father before ending the call, and made no effort themselves to coordinate care.  The father's lawyers filed for an emergency petition for her to be released to him, especially since detaining her in the first place was unlawful. The government showed up to court with hand written letter in Spanish they claimed was written by the mother saying she wanted to take her daughter with her. The judge demanded the government get the mother on the phone to verify she wrote the letter. The government came back that afternoon and said that wouldn't be possible since she and the children had already been sent to Honduras. Child was sent with no medication.",undercurrents,2025-04-26T19:59:32,24
