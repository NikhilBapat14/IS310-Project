"Stephen Miller is the human equivalent of extreme gastrointestinal distress, the patron saint of contrarian douchebags who think they are unlikeable *by choice.* You can practically smell his rotten breath through the screen. He's as loathsome a figure that has ever been produced by American politics. My only comfort is my absolute certainty that he's never known, nor will ever know, the joy of being loved.",CommanderJeezus,2025-04-29T18:07:45,16

">Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy and a longtime Trump loyalist, was grilled about the president's low poll numbers during a Fox News interview marking Trump's first 100 days in office.  >""A lot of people think that he's spending too much time on tariffs and not enough time on the economy and lowering prices,"" Roberts added. ""What do you say?""  >Miller brushed off the criticism, saying, ""I don't want to make things awkward for you, John, but it is our opinion that Fox News needs to fire its pollster.""  >",Silent-Resort-3076,2025-04-29T17:44:16,7

Trump's sudafed-addled brain is fundamentally incapable of seeing faults or recognizing any negative truths. That's part of his pathos as a malignant narcissist.   But his entire administration has adopted his psychosis as their new standard operation procedure.  It's insane.,HotDogFingers01,2025-04-29T21:34:03,2
