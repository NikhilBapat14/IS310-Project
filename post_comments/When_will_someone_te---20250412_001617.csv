All the republicans are too afraid of him to tell him. They will just continue to suck up even while he continues to debase them. It‚Äôs just sad.,sam-sp,2025-04-12T01:29:15,21

"There are some cracks. Republican senators pulled back on the tariff madness.  https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5236142-congress-tariff-bill-trump/  Once the fever dream breaks, there will be hell to pay.",BrupieD,2025-04-12T07:12:59,5

The Republicans have updated that parable with a new moral lesson more appropriate for the times:  ‚ÄúThat kid should have kept his f‚Äôing mouth shut!,specqq,2025-04-12T05:44:38,2

"Part of the infamy of this fable is the willingness of the emperor's entourage to go along with, to actually believe, to actually ""see"" the finest clothing imaginable as if it is all real.  Yeah, we got that.",YallerDawg,2025-04-12T09:38:26,2
"Never forget that, right now, Republicans in the House have the numbers to impeach him. And Republicans in the Senate, with Democrats' support, have the votes to convict him and remove him from office.",iKangaeru,2025-04-12T10:37:58,2

"I was talking with my wife and said that he was literally the emperor who wears no clothes, and his sycophants are the people who believed that they were just too fine to see.  I had to Google whether or not someone had indeed said this before, and here you are. Hans Christian Anderson might might take offense.",Unlikely_Monitor4723,2025-05-08T12:21:18,1

"Totally bizarro world that only a decade ago Chaney was seen as  squarely on the wrong side of politics and a deranged looney by the sub.    I have this theory that this might be some grand plan by the GOP, Heritage Foundation, etc., if not by design then by happenstance.  What I mean is that right now we are at a point in time where Liz Chaney, Haley, Christie, and a few others for President will seem like reasonable options to the majority when compared to Trump, Vance, and possibly DeSantis.    But yes, here words ring true.    I just wonder what these politicians will think about it, though.  I imagine some will sweep it under the rug and hope that others forget about it.",crucial_geek,2025-04-12T09:25:26,3

"I think we occasionally witness and will increasingly see him abusing his position and compensating his most loyal with the fallout. Perfect example is the video of him having a laugh with his cronies about the stock markets instability and 'how this guy made a fortune, and this guy cleared 800k'",lake_gypsy,2025-04-12T08:04:26,4
"I think every time these cracks appear to the the public, the administration, especially Trump, steps it back just enough in the most subtle sense of concern or damage control. Who knows anymore. I swear if I ever hear good news about this administration, the next day I realize it was just a fever dream.",lake_gypsy,2025-04-12T08:08:57,2

Sure her father was Dick.  But she risked a lot.  She‚Äôs probably still getting death threats for going against the orange.,Easy-Concentrate2636,2025-04-12T08:26:00,10
"Her economic and foreign policy views were repugnant. But she held her ground against a wannabe tyrant and his swarm of violent MAGAts. I can respect her for that, even if I would never vote for her.   She isn‚Äôt nearly as evil as her war mongering father. Who lied us into an invasion of Iraq over false evidence acquired with torture. If Dick had been in her shoes, I suspect he would have sided with Trump. He ultimately didn‚Äôt. But only because his daughter had the courage and conviction to stand up for our country.",auldnate,2025-04-12T09:27:40,3
"That's why I respect her so much. I can abide political differences, but with MAGA we are WAY passed that and on moral and ethical differences. Her and Pence and the few others who have stood against Trump, put country before party, AS IT SHOULD BE. They've risked alot. I may not agree with them 99% of the time, but they have my respect",bookluvr83,2025-04-12T08:48:35,6
