"""Trump not allowed to violate Congressional will""   So where the hell is Congress in all this and why dont they just clarify or change the laws in question? Didn't Republicans have a majority in both houses last anyone checked? Did all the Republicans suddenly drop dead or vanish into the void and nobody noticed? What have they even been doing the past half a year?",Teary_Oberon,2025-05-07T14:49:52,49

"Good idea! Or, think of it this way...  Imagine entering Disneyland (even illegally) and demanding that the Walt Disney Company be required to admit you inside and allow you to remain until a judge determines whether or not you have had ""due process.""   That is: Imagine that you demanded that you can reside inside the park as long as you wished until a judge determined whether or not you have a right to be there.  If that were permitted, the lines in Disneyland would be much, much longer than they are now. In fact, few people would pay admission because the park would be filled to the brink with freeloaders seeking ""due process.""  That is what happened to our immigration system and the orders of left-wing judicial activists, err, ""judges.""",chrismireya,2025-05-07T16:36:06,24

Congress is minding their own business because immigration doesn't fall under the legislative branch... That's executive. Now only if those in the judicial branch would realize this and do the same...  Edit: Downvotes from folks who don't like the truth? Yikes.,Rocket_Surgery83,2025-05-07T16:17:48,21
