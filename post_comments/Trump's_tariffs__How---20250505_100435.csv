"I had a conversation about tariffs with my MAGA dad over Sunday dinner yesterday. He understands and condones the fact that Americans have to tread water for Trump as we wait for deals to be made so Trump can reverse the tariffs that he is using for leverage. He doesn't see how this actually hurts anyone. He thinks it will be worth it in the end. He thinks Trump's graduation from Wharton demonstrates that he knows what he is talking about.   My dad is completely oblivious to real-world examples of how widespread tariffs have resulted in recession in the past, and he's ignorant of Trump's business history, which includes several bankruptcies of several casinos.  When I press him on really any issue, and he can't find a rational response, he always ends the discussion with, ""Not my problem.""  My dad doesnt read. He gets home from his 9-5 and puts on Fox. This is the low information voter that we are up against.",pacexmaker,2025-05-05T10:19:23,16

">The Trump administration's [tariffs](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/shop/video/bracing-tariff-driven-price-hikes-121389577) will impact American families and parents, increasing the cost of many household goods, experts say.  >Economists and researchers say the cost to Americans will be significant, with estimates ranging from nearly $4,000 to almost $8,000 per household.  >An April [analysis from The Budget Lab](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-april-15-2025) at Yale University estimates all 2025 tariffs so far will increase costs at least 3% and, on average, increase costs for the average American household by about $4,900.  >Leo Feler, a chief economist for consumer research firm Numerator, previously told [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/markets-continue-drop-trump-tariffs-place-economist-120558159) in early April that U.S. consumers will end up bearing the brunt of the cost of increased tariffs if new policies remain in place.  >""Since we import about $3 trillion worth of goods, if we are taxed at an effective rate at about 30% on these goods, if tariffs are effectively around 30%, collectively, American households and American businesses are going to pay an extra $1 trillion per year,"" Feler said at the time. ""That's about $7,700 per household in addition that we are paying for imported goods.""",YesterShill,2025-05-05T10:05:11,4

"Tariffs are a tool. Just like a hammer or a screw driver or a bus. They are also a tax. Just because you can drive a bus full of nuns off a cliff instead of going to Taco Bell doesn't mean you should. Tariffs and taxes are similar. The bus is just a tool.    https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/tariffs-101-what-are-they-who-foots-bill-and-who-wins-if-anyone   >Tariffs are taxes that governments impose on trade. While they can apply to exports, they are primarily levied on imports, typically to protect local industries. Imagine a local market selling apples. The retailer can choose between locally grown apples and imported ones. If a foreign producer wants to sell apples in this market, they might find their goods subject to a tax a tariff making imported apples more expensive than domestic ones. The rationale behind tariffs is straightforward:   >By making imports more expensive, tariffs make local goods comparatively cheaper and, at least in the short run, more competitive.    >Like other taxes, tariffs provide income that can be used to support local industries, fund public programs, or cover government expenditures.    >Tariffs can serve as bargaining tools to extract concessions from trading partners.",tech57,2025-05-05T10:49:44,3

"Big point here though is that many think this is just the art of the deal and will blow over. Hell, most of those rich people also don't realize how serious China and Japan are taking this. They really think negotiations will take place and everything will be back to normal next month.     China Just Turned Off U.S. Supplies Of Minerals Critical For Defense & Cleantech   https://cleantechnica.com/2025/04/05/china-just-turned-off-u-s-supplies-of-minerals-critical-for-defense-cleantech/   > What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers. >  > The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea.” >  > Try ramping up your semiconductor fab or solar plant when your indium source just dried up. It’s a fun exercise in learning which of your suppliers used to be dependent on Beijing but never mentioned it in the quarterly call. >  > The materials China just restricted aren’t random. They’re chosen with the precision of someone who’s read U.S. product spec sheets and defense procurement orders. Start with dysprosium. If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings. If dysprosium doesn’t come out of China, it doesn’t come out at all. It’s the spinal cord of electrification, and right now China’s holding the vertebrae. >  > So here we are. China has responded to Trump’s tariffs by cutting off U.S. supply of some of the most essential ingredients of the modern world.
