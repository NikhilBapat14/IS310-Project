Aww Republicans told her you ran your mouth too much and you're making us look bad.  News flash you all look bad and it doesn't matter.  ,arilupe,2025-05-09T19:23:53,49
She should do the world a favor and rule out ever running for any office again.,BukkitCrab,2025-05-09T19:32:54,21
"""I'm not running to flip a blue Senate Seat red because other Senate Republicans aren't MAGA enough"" is one way to try and hide what your polling told you, I guess.",whatifevery1wascalm,2025-05-09T19:30:58,28

Flipping a Senate seat after Trump shit show will be next to improbable while she can continue to be crazy ass MAGA maniac and will still win her MAGA rich gerrymandered district.,Plastic_Ad_1106,2025-05-09T20:03:53,1
She'll stick around in the House and carpet bag like Boebert to avoid losing,2HDFloppyDisk,2025-05-09T20:56:43,1
Cling to your little shit pile Marj,Academic-Dare-7677,2025-05-09T22:21:00,1
How is this butch body b still in congress?,Pretend-Disaster2593,2025-05-09T22:40:38,1
Noooo we were so close to getting rid of this troglodyte.,SG10HD-YT,2025-05-10T11:14:11,1
The sociopathic hilly billy caveman vote wasnt enough?,Duckyfuzzfunandfeet,2025-05-10T12:10:22,1
They know she can't win a statewide election.  She only gets elected because the people in her district are a cluster of ignorant morons.,SG10HD-YT,2025-05-10T11:17:15,1
But she looks even worse.,Supra_Genius,2025-05-10T09:29:18,2
"Yeah, don’t get bullied out of this Marge, just because you’re polling the worst out of everyone in the general is no reason to back down. Did Rudy back down? No! Did a plucky group of hockey players back down against our arch enemy? No! Did Rocky ever think maybe I shouldn’t do another sequel? No! It’s your god damn patriotic duty to go out there and lose that general election Marge! Or the terrorist win! For Reagan! For Apple Pie! For trickle down economics!  /s",JahoclaveS,2025-05-10T01:00:14,6
Would she though? Herchel Walker was an even worse candidate and still amassed millions of votes.,iiConTr0v3rSYx,2025-05-09T19:30:48,8
Yeah Georgia is more of a Yu-Gi-Oh state,xavPa-64,2025-05-09T20:25:18,2
She's already in Congress though?,thrawtes,2025-05-09T19:49:42,1
Yup.  That's why they most likely asked her to withdraw. ,arilupe,2025-05-10T09:31:44,2
I agree but I think the difference is Herschel Walker was not a known political entity. He ran a bad campaign and barely lost. Marjorie Taylor Greene on the other hand has 5+ years of extremely odious political behavior. I have to assume that the RNC took that into consideration.,writingt,2025-05-09T19:45:34,9
"Nobody likes MTG. She won by blatantly cheating, and then she moved to the most gerrymandered district to win again.    Walker only had a chance because of UGA. That's it.",DropC,2025-05-09T19:50:13,10
Not even close to worse than her,Out_For_Eh_Rip,2025-05-09T19:45:11,5
"Hershel had the UGA football connection, which here in Georgia is a big deal to certain voters.",swiftfoot_hiker,2025-05-09T20:51:47,3
No he wasn’t.  Greene is the absolute bottom scum of the barrel.  Hooves down.,Resident_Nothing_659,2025-05-09T22:39:58,1
So why start working now?,AcanthisittaNo6653,2025-05-09T19:54:10,2
also Herschel Walker was a famous football player and local hero.,CanvasFanatic,2025-05-09T20:41:04,5
"Yeah, presuming she actually managed to get more than 40%, and then won a runoff in June of next year involving the primary, she’d have lost by 8.  This isn’t like Herschel at all. If you’re not from the southeast, don’t underestimate how LOVED college football is down here.",95Daphne,2025-05-09T22:55:30,2
