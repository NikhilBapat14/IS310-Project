Who isn’t laughing at Trump?,jgasbarro,2025-04-25T12:22:08,204
Trump has revealed that he doesn’t understand who has leverage in the Putin negotiation. He’s remarkably bad at deal making.,ranchoparksteve,2025-04-25T12:26:34,61
Trump was meeting with the Norwegian representatives yesterday when one reporter raised the topic of Ukraine; stating that Ukraine has been told to make concessions by the U.S. and whether Trump has asked Russia to make any concession.  His response almost made me fall of my chair. He said Russia agrees to end the war and not take all of Ukraine.,PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T12:24:19,34

The world alternates between disgust at trump and laughing at him behind his back. He has zero respect out there. Some kiss up and play him.,CurrentlyLucid,2025-04-26T12:38:19,1
"Russia is so weak: after 3 years of total commitment, and with such a staggering cost in men, material, and treasure, they have only taken just 20% of Ukraine.   Their strategy, tactics, weapons, and definitely their Army's training and logistics, are all mostly 2nd or even 3rd rate. And that's without even mentioning here the sad showing of their Navy and Air Force.   Please procede with caution however, for Western Europe has seen this before from Russia: ""We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.""  Or shall we just let Finland have at 'em for a bit, maybe with some support from the Poles, or wouldn't that not be fair?",pcraig99,2025-04-26T13:08:11,1

The funniest thing to me is conservatives who truly think the world laughed at the USA under Obama and respect the USA under Trump.

My guess is that Putin has video of Trump watching underage girls/spys peeing on the bed Obama slept in when visiting Moscow and then captured Trump’s Jabba the Hut like statutory rape of these girls in another room. Trump doesn’t fear debt as he’s been horrible with debt his whole life. He fears embarrassment and will do ANYTHING to prevent it including selling out both Ukraine and the United States. Name another theory that comes anywhere close to explaining Trump’s subservience to Putin.,thalassicus,2025-04-25T13:00:41,31
"Anyone else see the video that was released of Witkoff and Putin meeting and shaking hands, and when Putin directed Witkoff to the table a lady sat down next to Witkoff and Witkoff asked ""Are you the interpreter? From the embassy? They sent you? Ok.""  Source (scroll to find the 27 second clip): https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cvg7jnywn5dt?page=2  How the fuck does Witkoff not know who the interpreter is going into a meeting with Putin to discuss a peace settlement? It is a higher likelihood that the interpreter is not from the embassy and is provided by Putin, and they can just make shit up and Witkoff will be none the wiser.  This is amateur hour and should be a scandal. I hope the media ask who the interpreter was and what preparation Witkoff makes when handling these highest of level negotiations.",Skiinz19,2025-04-25T13:35:15,23

I don't think Trump is concerned about blackmail.  He's invulnerable to that.  He has gotten away with so much already.  Trump does this because he wants to.  He admires Putin and wants to be a dictator just like him.,The-M0untain,2025-04-25T13:41:23,18

"The Trump administration paused aid to Ukraine back in March for a couple of weeks... Since resuming intelligence, financial, and military aid Trump has been putting more pressure on Ukrainian officials in the form of ceasefire agreements that include: ceding territory lost to Russia and/or mineral trade deals that are highly in favor of the US. It seems that while US aid to Ukraine has resumed (for now), Trump is already planting seeds in order to fully pull aid or kneecap the Ukrainian with a lopsided trade deal in the US’ favor.",BoringAd8187,2025-04-26T08:55:16,2

"Well, maybe not from anything incriminating.  However there is one thing that he has that he's very much not immune to that the Russians are almost certainly exploiting, albeit it being far more mundane: money, or more accurately debt.    It's long since been known that no Western bank or institution is willing to do business with Trump, so the only ones that will are Russian ones.  In fact it was even confirmed by one of his sons that Russian banks are the only ones they do business with.    However it's also known that the main reason why Western banks stopped is because Trump is notorious to failing to pay his bills and debts back.  And given how it reached the point he only does business with Russian banks, it's pretty easy to assume that he never broke that habit and still fails to pay his debt with the Russian banks.    Put 2 and 2 together, and it becomes quite apparent what Russia would use to bend him to their will.  ""Do this for us, and we'll look the other way on what you owe us.  Maybe even throw in something like a tower in Moscow if you're good enough.  Fail, and your businesses become ours"".",Randomman96,2025-04-25T15:54:19,9
"I reckon Trump sees the world as the domain of ""great men"", everyone subservient to their superior until three or four truly great rulers stand astride the world like colossi.  The reason he loves dealing with Xhi and Putin is that when they deal with him, it implies he's on their level, that they see him as a peer.  But I don't think leaders like Putin or Xhi do see it as a noble fraternity of greatness; I think they see Trump as an easily manipulated buffoon.  I honestly think he wants to help Putin because he sees him as a peer, he wants to promote the way things are done by the Russian government because it's how he'd like to do ""business""; and I think he likes Putin and he wants to be his friend.  It doesn't really matter when it comes down to it.  It's pretty clear that the snivelling sack of shit is betraying the interests of the United States on a daily basis.    When the reason a Russian asset shouldn't be POTUS is because they might betray the US for Russian interests, and you suspect him of being a Russian asset because you can see him betraying the US for Russian interests...  there's really some stuff you can skip, there.",Richeh,2025-04-25T17:21:27,7
"Sounds like wishful thinking to me, unless you've got numbers.    The sheer volume of cash he has to have made out of Truth Social stock value, Trump coin pumps and dumps, trading off the back of the stock market as he tanks the economy with tariffs...    And that's before you get to the outlandish numbers he's collecting from going fucking golfing.  Don't forget, it's his bloody golf course he's going to; a load of these millions of taxpayer money he's spending when he plays golf, he is paying *to himself*, in fees and security detail berths.",Richeh,2025-04-26T06:59:58,2

"I don't think money is enough to get Trump to betray the United States and the Constitution.  If it was just about money, he would have already paid back those loans from all the grifting he did in his last term and wouldn't need new loans.  His political career has been extremely profitable for him.  He has very wealthy allies who could easily help him pay back anything he owes Russian banks or oligarchs.  I think Trump is truly a fascist at heart and wants to become dictator so he can do anything he pleases and get revenge on all his enemies.  He has that type of personality.  He sees Putin as a role model the same way Hitler saw Mussolini as a role model.",The-M0untain,2025-04-25T15:59:12,8
