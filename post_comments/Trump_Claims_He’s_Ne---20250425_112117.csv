Long  ambiguous timeline approaching infinity.. with unknown terms and unknown parties...  Every country is negotiating using that terminology.,AdSevere1274,2025-04-25T11:25:48,1
"Trump thinks offering to talk about negotiation is actually negotiation. If anything, thus far China has said publicly if Trumps wants to start negotiations he needs to withdraw the newly imposed tariffs first. Even Japan now seems to be standing firm and that one is an important ally. Same with Canada.",PsychLegalMind,2025-04-25T11:25:57,1
"I think that Trump thinks he is negotiating, but it isn’t to work with China, who actually has an understanding of negotiation and holds the better cards.  Trump is just mostly screwing over Americans because he is an imbecile when it comes to making a deal.  Art of the deal is such a joke.  Maybe it worked for you in 1980’s real estate, Trump, but you are unwise in general when it comes negotiations.",Historical_Bend_2629,2025-04-25T11:49:53,1

"Sorry lefties, but Trump is playing 99D chess and you just don't know it. What Trump really meant is he's talking with China via telepathic communication and making the best deal ever. China just doesn't know it yet.",Puzzled_Job,2025-04-25T11:39:39,6
