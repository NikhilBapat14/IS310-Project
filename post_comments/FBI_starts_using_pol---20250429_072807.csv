"Of course Christian nationalist yahoos would bring back actual witch hunts.  These people are not only dangerous because they‚Äôre fascist zealots out to destroy democracy, the economy, academics and our institutions, but also because they‚Äôll use the most hollow and spurious hokum to do it.  They don‚Äôt need an actual confession or even a crime.",LuvKrahft,2025-04-29T07:40:47,3

"That matters only if they want to catch the actual leaker.  Polygraphs are very useful for eliciting confessions, and while I suppose FBI staff would be made of sterner stuff than usual victims, it could work there too.
