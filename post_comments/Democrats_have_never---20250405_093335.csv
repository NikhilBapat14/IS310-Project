Literally anyone who directly addresses working class issues and leads an aggressive fight against Republicans. Also making a commitment to mitigate the influence of business interests in politics would be helpful as well.,DREWCAR89,2025-04-05T10:04:29,10

"It’s not just democrats… this transcends party. And country.  Humans who need each other across the globe are all getting shattered from one old decrepit grifting snake oil salesman with a loud megaphone extorting gender, religion, politics every system societies have progressed to in order to be stronger together.  Even simple comforting family recipes have been replaced by McDonald’s burgers your dad who was maybe conservative said was only for a special occasion if you behaved-which he prefers to eat and bastardize for votes.",ViolettaQueso,2025-04-05T16:06:52,2
"If I were an aspiring 2028 nominee, I’d kidnap some of the top economists in the country and keep them in a war room developing scenarios and responses for the next three years with the sole purpose of crafting a pitch to lower prices and wrest ownership of business from 200 billionaires after Trump’s tariffs, while easing the path to home ownership, lowering drug prices, and subsidizing small business.  I think I’d also include a UBI proposal of some kind.",rjrgjj,2025-04-05T17:34:23,2

"The 2 party system is the only system possible under our constitution, which is why I am in favor of laying groundwork for constitutional overhaul, and I think democratic governors and think tanks should begin putting out detailed proposals for a constitutional convention, because congress won't do shit.  It is clear thar our constitution is in desperate need of reform and rebalance away from corruption, the tyranny of wealth, and minoritarian rule. There is a realistic chance our constitution will cease to exist in the next decade regardless - we may need a rapid plan to fill a void to preserve democracy, with or without many republican states. Now is the time for bold ideas and contingency plans.   That said, we get nowhere at all giving more power to Republicans by trashing the only party trying to preserve some semblance of democracy.",Pi6,2025-04-05T14:20:02,7
