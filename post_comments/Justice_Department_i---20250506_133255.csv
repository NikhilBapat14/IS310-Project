"Remember, the only reason we are talking about this one guy is that the Trump administration ***admitted*** he was deported by mistake. Now, simply because a tenant of fascism is that the leader can never be wrong, they are spending exorbitant resources to rewrite history that this guy was some horrible gang member.  Any person reading this comment could be “accidentally” swept up tomorrow, and the government will turn you into a monster just to justify their error. No one is safe.

"So the DOJ is trying to build a case against Abrego Garcia, after proclaiming he was a high ranking gang member. This indicates that he was deported based on flimsy or heresy evidence. He is being held in a foreign prison, not found guilty of any crime but facing an indeterminate incarceration. All because he is a Hispanic undocumented immigrant",Shr3kk_Wpg,2025-05-06T14:24:42,9

"""Oh, but we get to be monsters cuz he was--""  Let me stop you right there. The reason you don't get to be monsters is that *being monsters is horrific and wrong.* The guy could be literally Hitler and it'd still be a sin to grab him off the street and imprison him without trial in Central American hellhole where, according to the government that built it, you're only released in a coffin.  The United States is running a bona fide concentration camp, and you want people to stop making a fuss about it since hey, he had it coming, or, hey, he was no angel? *Why?* What the boysenberry fuck is wrong?  And yes, I'm expecting you to laugh off or bristle at the words ""concentration camp,"" either since you're thinking Birkenau instead of the Gulag or since you're still living in the lost golden age you grew up in. Please riddle me this: What crimes were these people locked up for? What are the sentences that they can serve to get out? Could the trials they've been given have sent them to regular jail? And what else do you think it takes to make a concentration camp?",Rellestys,2025-05-06T15:03:42,8
"That he was an illegal immigrant only saved by a withholding from deportation order (due to fear of a rival gang back home lol) is an established fact.  He had more due process than he deserved.

"Oh shit, one was ms13! We have no choice but to have a concentration camp and be much worse than him! He made us do it, it's all his fault.  Listen. A concentration camp isn't there to punish criminals. It's there to punish whoever the fuck the government wants. Happening to include the guilty is incidental at best, like driving a truck into a crowd and then going hey, statistically at least one of those people was a rapist! Justice was done!  Yes, this means that Bukele's only too happy to lock up his own citizens without trial for money. Why wouldn't he be? He gets paid for what he was already doing.  How do you feel about big government?

"> It's not a concentration camp, it's a prison. A harsh one, and I have no problem   with that.  Can't be a prison, you need a prison sentence to go to prison.  If the answer to ""How long's this guy in for?"" is ""How long do ya want?"" ""or ""Who the hell cares?"" that's a way to tell you're dealing with a concentration camp.  >It's not vibes, his membership is a matter of fact.  How does the government decide someone's guilt is a matter of fact, and not just angry internet talk? With a trial. Did he have one? No. Then it jailed him on vibes.  Someone might ask, this guy's such a scumbag, why should we have to jump through all the hoops of a trial? Why go to such trouble to protect him? Now that's a reasonable point and it's cataclysmically wrong.  We don't need trials to protect criminals or out of love of red tape. We need them to protect you. Once the government gets powerful enough to answer ""What's his sentence?"" with ""The fuck do you mean, sentence? Why'd he need a sentence when his guilt's a matter of fact?"" then that's it. Game over. Get out of the country immediately, or else smile, obey, never ever criticize the state, and live in terror of the midnight knock on the door.  >The dude is ms13, it's a very serious crime in ES to be a member of that gang, deportation would see him end up in that place no matter what.   ""Eh, someone else would've have jailed him anyway"" does not carry a jail sentence.  Once you're jailing dudes for things that don't carry a jail sentence, you've got - you got it! - a concentration camp. A concentration camp's just a jail without all the little touches that keep the people from living in terror of the midnight knock on the door.",Rellestys,2025-05-09T12:46:59,1

">Being a gang member is not a crime in the US, but it is grounds for deportation.  And instead of deporting him, the US deported and jailed him.  Yeah, USA's responsible for it. USA sent Marco Rubio to negotiate an arrangement where it pays El Salvador to lock up whoever it sends and to not ask questions. USA chose this guy to go to jail without trial. USA's paying for it. Hell, Trump's said he could just pick up the phone and get him back.  This whole rigmarole where Trump outsources the jailing to El Salvador in order to make a big show of saying, El Salvador did it, it's all their fault, nothing we can do, out of our hands, what a shame, isn't that right? And Bukele squeaks ""Right, boss!"" and Trump slips him a few mil is at best a pathetic attempt to dodge responsibility, at worst an attempted end run around the law to jail people the law says you can't jail.  And once the government gets powerful enough to jail people the law says it can't jail, you're back at the two words, both beginning with ""c"", and Americans living in terror of the midnight knock on the door.",Rellestys,2025-05-09T13:37:28,1
