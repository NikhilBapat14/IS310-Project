"I feared a Harris campaign would lose to Trump, just like [Hillary did](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dynefa/comment/lc9sr26/), when we were all spitballing possible replacement candidates after Biden's alarming debate performance.   I even speculated Biden would [hold out as long as possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dyg0hg/comment/lc9wabh/) to ensure Harris would be the only possible option to replace him.   After it became official, I thought she had a decent chance to win at one point but feared we were being gaslit by the polling again and felt that her lead [wasn't nearly enough](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1fe7fm6/comment/lmmevnx/).   You'd think the Democratic political strategists would have learned their lesson from 2016 and avoided the iceberg that even I, a reddit-posting schmuck, saw coming from miles away.",877GoalNow,2025-05-01T12:10:33,0
What’s the mystery? We are a nation of stupid.,veridique,2025-05-01T12:12:19,2
This comment is completely insane. I won't go to bat for Harris but her campaign was significantly better than Trumps. That being said to say that Trump is easily beat is MAGA level delusional. Trump is currently in the process of destroying democracy and losing a global trade war as we likely enter into a recession and yet AT LEAST 1 and 3 Americans would readily vote for him again. Pretending like there was some amazing candidate that could have easily defeated him while offering no names is just shitty armchair politics.,Solid_Primary,2025-05-01T11:51:12,2
All the Dems had to do was not fvck up. They were running against an utterly incompetent buffoon. But what did they do? They fvcked up. Not once but twice (at least). They decided image & pandering was more important than progress & stability. We're cooked.,PennysWorthOfTea,2025-05-01T11:54:28,3
Nope she was a good candidate. She crushed trump.in their debate and then he ran away and hid.  And in a racist country a racist idealouge with a massive cult of personality will never be easy to beat.,Zepcleanerfan,2025-05-01T12:34:24,0
"It wasn't that she's a woman. It's that she made the same mistake that Hilary Clinton and Joe Biden made: She ran as a moderate Republican instead of a Democrat. The moment they told Walz to step aside and started campaigning with Liz Cheney, it was over.   Democrats win decisive victories when they embrace change. When Harris refused to be different from Biden, it was basically over.",EdgeWardog,2025-05-01T12:39:21,4
"It really doesn’t have that much to do with them being women IMO. Hillary is just plain unlikable, she’s your classic out of touch two faced ‘elite’ establishment politician, would be just as true if she were a man. As for Harris, she didn’t even get to run a full campaign, and wasn’t chosen……as VP she was the only viable option to swap in that late in the race. Pulling Biden out at that stage was a desperation move. ",Bobbachuk,2025-05-01T12:26:52,3

"Sure, disparage one valid point because you don't like it. Border wall cool with you? Touring with Cheney cool with you? Saying she'd do nothing different in 4 years if she were president instead all kosher?   Don't hyper focus on one point. She is unpopular and it's naive to insist otherwise.    Can she salvage her reputation? Yeah, if she starts campaigning NOW. But if she waits until 2027 to even make an effort to build a movement then I'm sorry but that's not good enough. Don't crawl out of the shadows every 4 years. Trump campaigned for the entire Biden presidency, why aren't the Democratic leadership?   People want to believe in Harris/Walz as a ticket, but Walz is doing magnitudes more than Harris to actually pave the way for 2026 and 2028.",Mattractive,2025-05-01T12:40:21,1

Nope. Idiots voted on vibes because Trump promised to fix everything with no policy/plan or even a “concept.”   We told you exactly what he was going to do but no one believed us or claimed we’re overreacting.,2_Spicy_2_Impeach,2025-05-01T11:59:04,3
I felt the exact same way about Hilary too... Too many skeletons in the closet for them to pick at from a long political career while going against someone who was to many representative of the non politician candidate. I don't think people wanted 16 years of a husband wife shortly after 12 years of a father son.  If they continue to push female candidates I think Whitmer has a great shot but ultimately I just want the candidate who can win no matter what they are.,raynaud05,2025-05-01T12:03:27,1

"Well, the campaign spent more money, and her own campaign staff kept both Harris and Walz in the dark the entire time that they never took a lead in internal polling.  So more people got their wallets padded.  That's a sign of a better campaign.  It was an amazing campaign that didn't accomplish the only thing that matters, which is winning.    Clearly it was a great campaign...",Worldly-Horse5006,2025-05-01T14:48:09,1
"Well, I personally thought from the very beginning her being black women was going to make things extremely difficult. Also she was seen as a part of the current administration which many voters were tired of. I'm not going to say she was a great candidate but at the very least in a head to head debate she gave a significantly better performance (that at least could be said).      In addition to that, Donald Trump is an extremely popular candidate such that he can admit to sexual assault on tape, tell people to inject bleach to cure covid, lead a horrendous response against the pandemic, deny the results of an election for 4 years, became a convicted felon and then state that he would put in tariffs to lower prices which the vast majority of experts say would do the exact opposite effect and they still voted for him.   Even still he polls better than Kamala AND Democrats (generally Republicans seem to be pollnig better than general Democrats as well) as he actively hurts Americans and our standing globally. Not for nothing, I don't think Democrats have a succinct message especially with things the way they are now. I'm not sure how he can be doing so well now. It seems that a good chunk of Americans believe in him despite what he says. Again, he is extremely popular.  And AGAIN and AGAIN, who would YOU put up against him if it's just that easy?",Solid_Primary,2025-05-01T12:28:12,0
