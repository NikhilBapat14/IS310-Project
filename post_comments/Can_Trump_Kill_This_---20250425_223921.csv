"Absolutely, legislation needs to be enacted to permanently stop the leftists from turning this around! “Lurking my life away” is correct indeed!",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T05:07:58,0
"If we push our local GOP groups to nominate actual Conservative Republicans instead of RINO's and then make sure we go to the polls on election day to make sure they get elected.  After all it is up to us. We did it to get Trump back in, we can do it in 2026 to get more Conservatives in.  Most wont like this but it is UP TO WE THE PEOPLE to do this.  The House of Representatives is elected every 2 years. That means that we can try to put more Republicans in, not RINO's.",ComputerRedneck,2025-04-26T06:59:46,3
