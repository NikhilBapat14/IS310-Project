Today is a loss for journalism. I hope Bill does not let his recent job loss affect getting is voice out there. Seems to me he has done some great work in the past 6 years.

">Executive producer Bill Owens told staff in a memo that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ’60 Minutes,’ right for the audience,” according to The New York Times.  >“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” he added  >Owens’ exit comes as Trump is battling CBS in court over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, claiming the show defamed him by airing an edited version of the interview he claims made Harris sound better. CBS has denied the claim, and the two sides are currently seeking a mediator to settle the lawsuit.",UAngryMod,2025-04-22T12:57:41,279

This is a large part of why I hate people resigning in frustration.  THATS WHAT THEY BLOODY WANT.  So they can replace you with rubber stamps and sycophants.  I feel like clinging onto your jobs for dear life and fighting is more necessary than ever.  Resigning might give you a moral win but it’s completely antithetical to the whole issue at large  If you refuse to leave without being forcibly removed you sorely inconvenience the whole train and become a hardcore vector of resistance  Like people throwing their hands up over here how they can do more to resist this regime — and then on the other side we got people who are willing to resist the machine - except they just walk out so they can be replaced with a more efficient yesman.

If you're staying to just follow what the people bowing to fascism tell you to do then you're giving up right there.

"Most people don't realize that judges don't have much power to just dismiss a case until evidence is heard - in other words, until a trial happens. The legal standard to survive a pretrial motion to dismiss is really, really, **really** low and it was designed that way intentionally, because we tend to value the principle that most people should be able to have their day in court. That hearing the evidence is the best way to resolve litigation. It's also partly the result of the very real fact that most people won't have access to all of the evidence to support their case until they've had the opportunity to compel discovery from the other party, which can only happen if litigation is allowed to proceed at least for a good while.  This case is in its early phase. It's still conceivable that the judge may dismiss it at some point. But then again, people can always re-file or they can appeal. For many judges, the calculation is ""better to err on the side of letting everyone present their case, then after that's done, we can end it once and for all.""",night-shark,2025-04-22T21:17:02,5
