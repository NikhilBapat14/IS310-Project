"Trump will never be able to live up to the terrible Nixon. At least Nixon did things like:  - Founding the EPA - Title IX (Women in sports) - First President to give Native Americans the right to tribal self-determination by ending the policy of forced assimilation and returning their sacred lands. - First President to visit People’s Republic of China.  Dear god, please do not take this as my approval of Nixon - just to show how far right US politics have shifted.",no_kids-and-3_money,2025-04-30T17:34:04,11

The difference here, is that GOPs are doing their damnedest to make sure Dems can't repair the damage this time.",phosdick,2025-05-01T08:33:18,2
