"I bet there are exactly zero quality checks on these aggregated data, which will make the end result exponentially less reliable.  Let me relate an old learning experience.  I was the QC coordinator at a big hospital with roughly 1000 MDs on staff.  The Medical Staff Office had to manually aggregate a slew of utilization data -- patients admitted, outcomes, average length of stay, types of surgeries, pathology results, in-hospital complications and infections, etc etc -- for a third of them every year to meet reaccreditation requirements.    I said, aha! I can simplify your lives immensely. Let me survey all the stand alone databases in various hospital departments (about 20 in all different file and data formats), collate the data and print out yearly dashboard reports for every MD and you'll be in nirvana. It'd be my tour de force.  Wrote up the code to pull, normalize and aggregate the data and generate the reports. Cut the ribbon and fired up the app. Big moment -- until I saw data mismatch after mismatch.  Example: OBs whose numbers of normal deliveries and C-sections didn't match between the ""official"" codes assigned in Medical Records and sent to Billing, and the equally ""official"" numbers documented by Labor & Delivery.  I use this example because it's such a simple, low-level bit of data that should always match up no matter the source, and is the basis for the C-section rate which is a key metric for every obstetrician.    I did this after 20 years on the job that gave me deep clinical insight into all aspects of the data, and still couldn't get the numbers to match.  They were at least as reliable as the old manually tabulated numbers, but the medical staff shit all over the reports because ""the computer can't even make them match"".  These DOGE script kiddies know nothing about the data they're pulling (and they've already demonstrated it many times).  Much less do they care about accuracy and consistency in aggregating and normalizing it.  They're men on a mission! Fuck that piddlyshit!

"Yes it doesn’t address people entering illegally other than to say let’s make it easier for them to become Americans which motivates people to enter illegally.   H.R. 3194, known as the U.S. Citizenship Act, was introduced in the House of Representatives on May 10, 2023, by Rep. Linda T. Sánchez (D-CA). The bill aims to comprehensively reform the U.S. immigration system by providing a path to citizenship for certain undocumented individuals, addressing root causes of migration, and implementing various immigration-related reforms. ￼ ￼  Key Provisions  1. Pathway to Citizenship 	•	Lawful Prospective Immigrant Status: Establishes a new status for noncitizens continuously present in the U.S. since January 1, 2023, who pass background checks. After five years, eligible individuals can apply for lawful permanent resident status. 	•	Immediate Permanent Residency: Provides permanent resident status to certain noncitizens, including those who: 	•	Entered the U.S. as minors (e.g., DACA recipients). 	•	Were eligible for Temporary Protected Status or Deferred Enforced Departure as of January 1, 2017. 	•	Performed a specified amount of agricultural labor in the five years preceding their application. ￼ ￼  2. Terminology Update 	•	Replaces the term “alien” with “noncitizen” in immigration statutes to reflect more inclusive language. ￼  3. Immigration System Reforms 	•	Conviction Definition: Redefines “conviction” for immigration purposes to exclude certain expunged or vacated convictions. 	•	Visa System Enhancements: Reforms the immigrant visa system, including the recreation of the V visa program to allow families to await visa approval together in the U.S. 	•	Judicial Review and Naturalization: Modifies provisions related to judicial review and naturalization processes to restore fairness and efficiency. ￼ ￼ ￼  4. Addressing Root Causes of Migration 	•	Central America Strategy: Mandates the Department of State to implement a strategy promoting reforms in Central America, focusing on combating corruption, violence, and poverty. 	•	Refugee Processing Centers: Requires the establishment of refugee processing centers in Central America to manage and process asylum seekers effectively. ￼ ￼  5. Border Management and Security 	•	Personnel Training: Mandates that U.S. Customs and Border Protection sectors and stations have personnel with specific qualifications, such as paramedic training. 	•	Technology Deployment: Calls for the deployment of smart technology at the southern border to enhance security and efficiency. 	•	Oversight and Accountability: Establishes measures to ensure the protection of border communities and uphold civil rights. ￼ ￼  6. Anti-Discrimination Measures 	•	Prohibits religious discrimination in granting or denying immigration benefits, ensuring equal treatment for all applicants. ￼  7. Support for Immigrants 	•	Establishes grant programs to provide training and services to immigrants, facilitating their integration and contribution to society. ￼  Legislative Status  As of December 17, 2024, H.R. 3194 has been referred to multiple House committees, including the Judiciary; Ways and Means; Armed Services; Education and the Workforce; House Administration; Financial Services; Natural Resources; Oversight and Accountability; Foreign Affairs; Homeland Security; Intelligence (Permanent Select); and Energy and Commerce. The latest action was its referral to the Subcommittee on Trade. The bill has not advanced beyond the introduction stage.  ￼ ￼",CurrencyUser,2025-04-26T09:23:00,1
