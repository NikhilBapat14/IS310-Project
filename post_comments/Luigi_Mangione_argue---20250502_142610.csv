"Where are all these slick lawyers for the people who are actually victims of crimes? He answered questions in a McDonalds and because he wasn’t read his Miranda rights first she wants his statements to the police excluded?? If he wasn’t under arrest yet, why would they need to read him his rights first?",Szorja,2025-05-02T15:11:24,31
"In order for Miranda to apply, you have to be asked incriminating questions AND feel you are not free to leave.",R0binSage,2025-05-02T20:33:43,11
"Correct me if I'm wrong. But the Miranda rights thing is played up on TV. If you are talking with a cop and offering information, that is not infringing your right to remain silent. If you get pulled over for running a stop sign and accidentally admit to the officer you got 2 KG of cocaine in a void space under the back seat, you are gonna get charged for that. He wouldn't have Miranda'ed you at that point, but you also gave him the information.",Tough_guy22,2025-05-02T18:37:00,18
Lawyers will try anything when they know their case is fucked,SpecialistNote6535,2025-05-02T17:32:08,6
"yea iirc the way it works if they arrest you, dont read you your rights and interrogate you at the prison/jail then yea i could understand that, but in this case nah hes trying not to fry.",Stephan_Balaur,2025-05-02T22:54:54,4
In addition. Lack of reading of Miranda rights does not get you off scot free. The evidence which would be diaquailifed would be from that specific line of questions. The main evidence against him is a photo of him walking away from the scene dressed in the outfit the murderer wore.,Tough_guy22,2025-05-02T23:20:19,3
