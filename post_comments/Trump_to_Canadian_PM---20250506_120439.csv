"Fuck 47. Goes without saying. But also fuck the Republican traitors in congress who are continuously watching a demented old man berate and threaten the sovereignty of one of our oldest allies and do nothing about it.  I don’t know if it’s fear, complicity, or just being disgustingly evil beings that stop them from acting, and frankly I don’t care out of the 3 which one it is. It’s disgusting, embarrassing and infuriating watching this fucker destroy *everything* and republicans just fucking let him.",Spicy_Pancake1,2025-05-06T12:08:21,42

"For those dissing Carney for not jerseys-ing Trump:  Let’s do a reality check:  this is the White House.  It would be national suicide to jersey Trump in the White House.   Secondly, Trump is a blowhard and a braggart.  He will always get the last word, doubly so in his “house”.  So, let’s put this perspective and acknowledge that Carney was never going to go into the White House and jersey Trump, let alone be allowed to say anything substantive nor concrete, apart from the whole “51st state” drivel that Carney clearly and without hyperbole, said “never” in response to Trump’s “never say never” babble.  Carney came across as poised, confident, intelligent, and articulate.  He was able to get his points across in a precise and effective manner, without drama nor hyperbole.  Look at the March and especially April economic data coming out of Industry Canada (just released today).  Canadian exports are already pivoting (albeit small) offshore.  It will happen and fascist America will eventually wind up looking at empty shelves, shuttered factories, refineries and smelters / forges, strip-mined national reserves / parks, and wonder what the heck happened ….  The real discussions will be at the functional level, behind closed doors, fully orchestrated by Carney, Joly, and a bunch of very smart people that won a losing hand for CUSME 1.0.  Before we start screeching at the sky about Carney not being “tough enough”, let’s let the dude that ran two central banks, was a senior advisor to the WTO, a key executive for a major international commercial property and investment company, as well as being a grad of both Harvard and Oxford, do his thing.   We can review in 3 & 6 months.  Before then, let the dude do his dekes.",Spanky3703,2025-05-06T12:45:11,6

"You could put a walrus next to Trump at a press event and it would still look more professional. That being said, is that enough for Canada? Trump is threatening the nation on a regular basis, did so again right in the PM's face.

That would immediately escalate the situation from a hypothetical target on the backs of my loved ones to a very real target on the backs of my loved ones.  That is INSTANT war. Carney's response is to continue decoupling from the US, as it should be.  Canada is not required to throw itself on a live grenade so that you can feel satisfied that some form of incredibly stupid justice is being done.",MariyamShuffles,2025-05-06T12:33:20,4

"Probably the most reasonable response is decoupling until the US doesn't vote up a narcissistic leader, hoping it will just blow over and does not escalate. Though I wish peace, prosperity, and healthy trade for both countries.   Agreed, military action is the worst plan ever. It almost never particularly works out for either country and just induces trauma. Just look at all the other recent conflicts. You think anyone is benefiting from ukraine/Russia, what about gaza/israel. Is Iraq or Afghanistan any better off today. This shit almost never works, and history just repeats itself with selfish, bloodthirsty people who think it does. WW2 was arguably one of the last recent wars (at least in the US but probably Canada too) that was worth a damn and that was 80 years ago.",hdth121,2025-05-06T14:31:17,2
