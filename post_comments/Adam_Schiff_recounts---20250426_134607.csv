"Love , love, love how he's just now talking about this.  I live far from California and knew this was a problem when I visited in 2019.  This fucker is FROM there.   It's only a problem NOW because polling has turned against the Democrats on this and the right ward shift in voting during the last election. ",TedriccoJones,2025-04-26T14:13:07,31
Sounds like someone is running for the next governor of California.  Of course he is one of the problems that caused all their issues.,mdws1977,2025-04-26T14:25:58,20
"Sen. Adam Schiff revealed that his luggage was stolen in South San Francisco two years ago, and that a clerk in a nearby Target afterwards “basically said in not so many words, yeah, Democrats are a—holes” when he went shopping for toiletries.  The Golden State senator used the anecdote to acknowledge that Democrats have a “major problem” and are fundamentally “going to have to change how we do business in California.  Democrats, leftists, communists, socialists, marxists, mostly all in the same boat together.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-26T14:53:06,13
"No shit. These out-of-touch hypocrites live in wealthy neighborhoods surrounded by \*walls\* and armed security.       Of course they have no idea how much of a shithole SF has become. Along with most if not all democrat controlled cities. I feel sorry for those of us who have to deal with this BS, but these dimwits have it coming.",TypicalWisdom,2025-04-26T14:27:19,11

"Democrats in 2016: I’m running to fix x problems, causing more problems. Democrats now: I’m running to fix all the problems that I caused previously.   Forgive me for being cynical.",ILikestoshare,2025-04-26T15:00:54,14
It’s classic leftist strategy.   1. Create a problem.  2. Try to “solve” it.  3. Claim you “tried”.  4. Win reelection perpetually.,TypicalWisdom,2025-04-26T15:45:52,10
