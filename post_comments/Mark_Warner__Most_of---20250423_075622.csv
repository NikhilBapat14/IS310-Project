Hegseth is a POS. Only a dick like Trump would nominate him. And only GOP asswipes would vote to confirm him.,dantekant22,2025-04-23T09:31:55,11

We have a weekend Faux news host in charge of our country's defense üòµ he has already shown himself to be COMPLETELY UNFIT for this position. HE NEEDS TO GO. STEP DOWN OR YOU'RE FIRED. üò°,1Surlygirl,2025-04-23T09:05:49,9
Republicans that do not stand up against this will only put America at risk in the future‚Ä¶especially our military men and women.,Such_Lemon_4382,2025-04-23T08:17:58,6
This is absolutely the most dysfunctional and corrupt administration that I have ever seen.,VanDenBroeck,2025-04-23T08:51:19,7
Dear leader doesn't make mistakes. Dear leader is perfect in every way. Dear leader picks only the best people.  Dear leader should never be questioned or challenged in any way.  There's nothing to see here.,TuffNutzes,2025-04-23T08:24:58,6

I know this is off topic‚Ä¶but is it just me or does Mark Warner look really different in this video?  Edit: honestly‚Ä¶maybe he‚Äôs just tired. I know I would be if I were in his shoes right now.,bassocontinubow,2025-04-23T09:04:44,3
"Nah, a lot of service people would have to die before Congressional Republicans will take action.  Unless that is, the phones in the offices of Constitutional Republicans are being rung off their hooks by constituents, especially those from the military or retired military. So, wake me when that's happening (but I'm not expecting it to happen).",MMessinger,2025-04-23T08:40:26,3

A man who already went through the judicial process and was granted his right to stay in the US had that court ruling ignored. Now he‚Äôs in a prison in El Salvador. People are being detained for days without any due process. WE ARE ALREADY LIVING UNDER AN AUTHORITARIAN REGIME.,Flat-Emergency4891,2025-04-23T19:05:16,2

"They spent way too much money and political capital to get him confirmed to abandon him at this point. As long as Elon‚Äôs money is available to Trump, none of the republicans will speak up to get him removed. I‚Äôm pretty sure at this point, he could show up visibly drunk and they would just laugh it off.",coldtakes69,2025-04-24T02:55:05,1

For that to happen he would have to be prosecuted by the neutered DOJ.  And then The Orange One would pardon him anyway‚Ä¶,Wet_Side_Down,2025-04-23T09:21:12,2

Don‚Äôt forget the heavy lifting Roy did for Joe McCarthy. Roy absolutely loved trashing what we call the LQBTQ+ today while being the queeniest fluffer in the closet.
