"**TL;DR**: Pete Hegseth, U.S. defense secretary, bypassed Pentagon security by setting up an unsecured ""dirty line"" to use Signal on a personal computer, risking leaks of sensitive data. Reports say he shared classified info via Signal with family and friends, contradicting his past criticism of Hillary Clinton's email practices.",pharrt,2025-04-25T08:13:10,6

"Retired Army speaking. Two tiers of military internet connectivity. SIPR and NIPR. Top dog in DOD can have both systems open next to each other. I did. What I didn’t do? I didn’t take a disk, load it with classified details from the side with the highest security permissions, disconnect that disk from a “secured system”, insert said disk with details in violation of all military protocols for handling sensitive information and place it on a lower level of security. That disk now on an internet that can have whatever unauthorized software installed [NOT SUPPOSED TO], because, he has “weak” cell service, in a building that is basically not supposed to have average, run of the mill outside access, and then copy said sensitive/classified info into a group chat with unvetted, unauthorized, most importantly, people with “NO NEED TO KNOW” and hit send… I guarantee you his emails were secure.",ayrcommander,2025-04-25T09:40:50,2
