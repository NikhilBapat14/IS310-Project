">FBI, the US Marshals, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  There you go.  Just like F Troop had to be hidden for a while and then quietly dismantled in a authority saving manner after then went outside the rules too many times.  There is your list.    I am sure Trump will pardon all of their activity's.  But as we all know by now, that doesn't mean anything to state charges.",wanderingpeddlar,2025-04-29T21:45:03,43

Terrorizing families is intentional. Trump thinks making people scared will make them comply. He's done it his whole life.,threehundredthousand,2025-04-29T23:49:16,15

What’s going to happen when they do this in a southern state and police officers get blasted with 00 Buck? This seems awfully dangerous for everybody with a more than one amendment.,pteague04,2025-04-30T00:09:56,7
"This was a Proof of Concept raid, now they know they can raid homes, of “illegal aliens”, say it was a mistake and keep phones, computers, and other miscellaneous information. They don’t have to even leave their names and still traumatize the residents. This is a good way to gather intel on opposition, their allies and sources, and traumatize their families and neighbors.",johnn48,2025-04-30T11:02:44,3

This story is horrifying. They took all her electronics and money and didn’t leave any kind of identifying information. How can people even be sure these are really agents? They had her minor daughter outside in her underwear and now they’re saying they’re under no obligation to return her belongings?!?,Snapdragon_4U,2025-04-29T21:55:32,49
Five times a day on average. That sounds about right.,Bebopdavidson,2025-04-30T07:11:46,4
"Was Ruby ridge fucked up?  What about the assault on the branch Davidians or the Bundys.  It's not about the administration it's about previous administrations allowing this kind of brute force behavior being so pervasive.  The woman was right when she asked what makes those asshole agents any more entitled to their life, liberty and pursuit of happiness that she apparently wasn't entitled to.   Furthermore, when I saw the original report, I knew something was wrong.  The FBI and US Marshals wouldn't have been there for that raid.  It's careless reporting that causes the media to have such a low rate of trust.",banderson2002,2025-04-30T12:26:35,1
"Beyond that, I believe Trump enjoys doing it as well. That's how history's biggest crybully feels powerful. ",brickout,2025-04-30T05:05:08,4

"Biden isn’t any farther gone than Trump. Yes he is old, but he is still fully aware of what is going on and was through out his presidency. Trump was the one recently sleeping at the Popes funeral.",Krash412,2025-04-30T02:51:08,8
">How can people even be sure these are really agents?   they absolutely shouldn't be, because the coverage for this incident makes it clear that none of them were actually US Marshals or FBI Agents. this article says   >The Marshals denied participating in the raid, while the FBI told the outlet it had assisted on the case.  and [The Hill's article about it](https://archive.is/xrnaS) says  >When reached for comment last week, a spokesperson for the FBI told KFOR it was assisting with the case and directed inquiries to Homeland Security. Late Tuesday, **the FBI told KFOR it was not on the scene** and again instructed KFOR to contact Homeland Security.  (emphasis mine)",the_itsb,2025-04-30T07:27:44,11
What they say and what a judge says are two different things.    I hope they are smart enough to file a complaint that the  agents violated their civil rights.   That would a felony charge.  But no matter what they should go after the agents monetarily for millions.  personally go after the agents that is.  Not just their agency but the agents.  Oh and file for court costs as well.     And do it at the state level.  That way they can't be pardoned.,wanderingpeddlar,2025-04-29T23:31:10,26

"No, actually what would happen is the cops would gear up heavier then shoot first and ask questions later  They'd roll up in armored trucks, smash the house in and start tossing in grenades",augustusleonus,2025-04-30T05:20:35,6
