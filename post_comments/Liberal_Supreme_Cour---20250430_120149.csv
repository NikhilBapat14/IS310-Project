"The case pits two First Amendment protections against one another – the Establishment Clause, which prohibits state governments from favoring or endorsing one religion over another; and the Free Exercise Clause, which establishes the right of individuals to practice their religion freely and without government interference that unduly burdens them from doing so.",Sure-Wishbone-4293,2025-04-30T12:46:52,11
"The Establishment Clause *shouldn't* come into play.  Nobody is forcing parents or kids to go to the school. It would only be problem if they were restricting choices of qualified religious schools to only one religion.  I live part time in Belgium and they have it right.  The money follows the student. Religious, secular, whatever, the money follows the student.",Kahnspiracy,2025-04-30T15:21:50,9
"It is true that this Court and others often refer to the “Establishment Clause,” the “Free Exercise Clause,” and the “Free Speech Clause” as separate units. But the three Clauses appear in the same sentence of the same Amendment: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.” Amdt. 1. A natural reading of that sentence would seem to suggest the Clauses have “complementary” purposes, not warring ones where one Clause is always sure to prevail  over the others.
