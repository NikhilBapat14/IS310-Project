Didn't Trump end SALT with his first Tax bill??  Lmao,blues111,2025-05-01T16:15:19,9
Why would the Republicans give the Middle class a tax break? All the money belongs to the billionaires and giving us a break means they get less. The Republicans would never stand for that.,FreshRest4945,2025-05-01T17:59:56,7
"From Bloomberg News reporters [Erik Wasson](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AR59NaVzr6k/erik-wasson) and [Billy House](https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ASGMzIlI8Os/billy-house):  Key House Republicans on Thursday discussed ways to direct an expanded state and local tax deduction to those making less than $400,000 as they seek to balance the cost of the tax break with the political needs of several lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states.  The $10,000 cap on SALT, one of the most contentious issues in the GOP debate on its giant tax bill, remained unresolved as lawmakers left Washington Thursday.  Republicans on the House tax panel discussed a series of options to direct the deduction to middle class households, New York Representative Nicole Malliotakis told reporters. Committee members delved into options, including the overall cap level, how many years to extend it and if there should be income limits for who can claim the write-off, she said.  “It needs to be adjusted in a reasonable manner where it is targeted to the middle class,” she said, adding that the Ways and Means Committee would reconvene on the issue next week. Malliotakis represents Staten Island.",bloomberg,2025-05-01T16:11:13,2

One of the biggest tax increases,now_error_later,2025-05-01T18:26:20,2
Yes he did! Only president in my lifetime that stole money directly out of my families pockets/ we loose apptox17k a year thanks to his screwing over the middle class and getting rid of salt. Biden an ass too as he could have reinstated but didn’t-never even talked about salt and how it hurt the working middle class significantly. All politicians are arses as they don’t care and want to place more tax burden on middle class families instead of the billionaires. Pretty fd up,void-cat-181,2025-05-01T16:20:07,6
Don't blame Biden for dump & the republican congress' actions.,gergek,2025-05-01T16:32:35,13
Yeah but Biden didn’t address it when he was president and that really should have been a main talking point. Biden completely ignored the working middle class.,void-cat-181,2025-05-01T16:40:21,-13
"Ignorant what-about-ism.   Trump has and is actively destroying the middle class, it’s much easier to tear things down than to reestablish them.",aswat89,2025-05-01T17:57:15,9
"Pull up that video of the guy struggling to keep a dozen spinning plates on sticks.  That is how Biden operated.  The plates are our government and all the different parts of that machine.  It is easier to let the plates fall and smash to the ground, and walk on the mess not caring.  Guess which party and person is doing THAT.",RonaldMcDaugherty,2025-05-01T17:07:17,7
"How do you gauge how well the middle class is doing? I look at unemployment rate, wage growth, and the stock market. All of which did well under Biden. Now do Trump.",dr_z0idberg_md,2025-05-02T01:26:37,2
"Excuses, excuses. The working middle class votes, maybe why dems are having a hard time of it is bc they havnt cared much for the working middle class? I definitely don’t feel like any policy since Carter has really looked to address the issues of the working middle class.",void-cat-181,2025-05-01T20:44:21,-3
"I look at my own pocket book and putting 2 kids through college as a public school teacher and husband an environmental engineer both working full time. No debt, old cars, no vacations, high taxes, high insurance, expensive medical-I got breast cancer- we follow the rules and pay more every year- can’t ever get ahead. We struggle to pay the bills each month. Numbers tell me nothing- it’s what I’m personally experiencing. Telling me Biden was good for me is total bs because he didn’t help the middle class tax burden. Great the stock market did well but if you dont have enough funds to pay bills you don’t have enough to invest in the stock market. You right now by saying that sound like every politician discounting the working middle class telling me I should have done great under filling the blank politician. Yes I have a job. It if that job doesn’t pay enough to keep up with bills is it really a good job? Do better for the working middle class. Actually help me financially by reducing my tax burden, making insurance companies be held accountable by placing max rates, make utilities public so they can’t gouge customers, hold food companies in check - not allowing them to gouge customers, etc. do better for those that actually pay into the system and vote. The dems have totally missed. The mark as the working middle class is completely ignored. No wonder we’re in this shithole rn.",void-cat-181,2025-05-02T10:05:24,1
