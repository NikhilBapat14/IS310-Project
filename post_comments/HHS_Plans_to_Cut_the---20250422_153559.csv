"PSA [the Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/get-help/) is a non-profit organization that runs their own national suicide hotline for LGBTQ+.  This doesn’t excuse the dangerous policies this administration is taking, but it is worthwhile information if you or someone you know is struggling. *(Also a very worthwhile donation if you want to help in some way!)*",FearlessSea4270,2025-04-22T15:44:05,50

I suppose he wants as many to die as possible.  I guess that's one way to get rid of people you don't value.  Hope they kill themselves.  This guy is a total a\*\*hole.,loriwilley,2025-04-22T16:24:15,9

It’s times like these that convince me there isn't a God or karma but just our apathetic collective consciousness on repeat.   I'm so sorry to all the people this will harm. We have to do better.,greenbigman,2025-04-23T00:39:24,2
"Can someone show me where it actually says that? If you look at the document they link to:  [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/606e6778226e5b3b32094244/t/68000a2cf27d5a766022e993/1744833090217/HHS+FY26+Budget+Proposal.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/606e6778226e5b3b32094244/t/68000a2cf27d5a766022e993/1744833090217/HHS+FY26+Budget+Proposal.pdf)  I don't see where they say they're cutting it. Specifically, it says on page 14:  By April 15, please provide a proposed allocation of 988 funding.  It looks like its current funding is over half a billion. So are they reducing its size?",TheGhostOfNull,2025-04-24T10:43:27,2

"They're going to kill as many people as possible. USAID cuts children started dying within days. HIV-AIDES patients are dying. Seniors can't afford meds, insulin $35 cap removed. Cuts in agriculture ends feeding children in America. Public ED cuts. Measles spreading, whooping cough, and other illnesses and they're not releasing data to the public. Wisteria, E coli, salmonella outbreaks not none be reported. Veterans hotline also cut. People disappeared sent to death camp, no due process, students jailed for free speech. We haven't seen the end of the cruelty! Are they trying to kill more than Hitler...I believe so. Start preparing for 2026 elections now to stop the killing. Market manipulation began this morning, more insider trading! ",Jen_3768,2025-04-23T08:39:36,1

"I’ve read many comments from actual callers that make it sound like the hotline is actually more traumatizing for the people calling in than it is helpful.   Thankfully I haven’t had a need to call, and hopefully you have not either, but it sounds like there might be more to this.",CAtwoAZ,2025-04-24T22:28:02,1
"They’ll also be affected by this cut:  > The Trevor Project, one of the handful of organizations that make up the LGBTQ+ Youth Subnetwork, responds to about half of 988’s calls and texts from LGBTQ youth. This year, the subnetwork received an estimated $50 million in federal funding.",sluttttt,2025-04-22T15:54:41,22

"Just above what you quoted on page 12 (page 14 according to the e reader).  ""The Budget funds the 988 Suicide Prevention and Crisis Lifeline at 2024 Enacted levels. The Budget maintains the $10 million for specialized services for Spanish speakers seeking access to 988 services through texts or chats and eliminates the 2024 Congressionally-directed set-aside within the 988 for Specialized Services for LGBTQ+ Youth. By April 15, please provide a proposed allocation of 988 funding.""  Eliminating the 2024 set aside for LBGTQ+ youth is cutting the budget.
