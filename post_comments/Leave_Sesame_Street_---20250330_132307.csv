"How tiring it must be to spend your lives hating everything..  Stress levels?  I was going to mention heart attacks, but you'd have to have one.  Don't like Sesame Street?  Change the damn channel!  Nobody is forcing your kids to watch it.  Same with NPR though my 2004 Honda has never had any other station on.  You can learn a lot on NPR and PBS.  You want to stay stupid?  Your perogative.",EDSgenealogy,2025-03-30T13:54:57,18

"Support PBS financially if you can. I called and donated when I first heard about the possibility of them being completely cut off from federal funds a month ago. They actually get very little from them now, but that bit could cause more stations to close.",Pantsonfire_6,2025-03-30T14:01:32,14

They want to be able to easily influence young people into being rascist bigoted white  supremacist. Sesame street profiles diversity inclusion and compassion. Always has. Grooming starts young. That's why they want to take away black studies in schools and want to attack other minority groups. The minds of children are fragile and in our preteen through teen years we learn a lot about ourselves inthe world. If they can push a strictly white supremacist bigoted narrative on the countries children especially white children we will have a problem on our hands. That's why Hitler had the Nazi youth to indoctrinate them that young and why most alright wing extremist groups have youth parties. It's disgusting and I know we have people in the right places ready to fight this nonsense.,SugarwaterNkoolaid,2025-03-30T14:27:08,7

If they‚Äôd end the tax free status for churches and instead require them to file taxes and only get credits for what the actually provide in charity.  If they did that there would be plenty of cash for real educational programming.,ArdenJaguar,2025-03-30T14:11:31,3

Sesame Street has always been a target of hysterical right wingers. The fact that Sesame Street is set in what looks to be an urban environment and has a large cast of POC interacting with white children has never sat right with these people. And isn't PBS largely funded by donations? What the hell are all of those telethons and fund raisers about?,LivingIndependence,2025-03-30T20:12:25,1

The very fact that musk is screaming 'propaganda' proves he's doing it himself:  it's projection on a massive scale and we can all see it.,forrestfaun,2025-03-31T11:11:16,1
"Both are NGOs.  NPR receives less than 2% of their funding from the Fed Gov and for PBS it can very depending on the market (more rural gets more Fed funding).  But, both can survive without Fed funding, although some rural affiliates might go off the air.  This is a straw man argument at best.  And once again, if you disagree with the message then you are not in the target audience.  The bottom line is that they hate fact based media and for the Fed Gov to support anything that is for the public good.",crucial_geek,2025-03-31T12:34:36,1
What did the muppets do to Musk and MTG that they hate them?  There not anti American or communist it‚Äôs just puppets telling kids good lesson like math and kindness   It really goes to show how boneheaded Elon and MTG are,Pre-KGlueJunkie,2025-03-31T13:22:20,1

"I don't think anyone gets this. Am this about pushing white supremacist agenda in children, and mentality to work for trump and musk. if there is no pbs or sesame street they can push whatever non inclusive hateful agenda they want on kids starts with sesame street then all of sudden they ban all children. Shows except this which teach them to love trump and hate gays migranggs blacks Jews and poor people etc",SugarwaterNkoolaid,2025-03-30T14:30:45,4
"HBO actually bought out Sesame Street, but PBS deserves the help anyway.  Actually the fascists are going after the entire Corporation for Public Broadcasting which funds a lot of the U.S.'s public television and radio, and funded Sesame Street since the beginning, so donate to them too.",starmen999,2025-03-30T15:27:36,7

"That's because he often had disabled children as guests on his show, when the conservatives believed that ""those people"" shouldn't be visible and should be institutionalized somewhere. He also had a huge heart, empathy, and encouraged children to accept themselves for who they are, and not try so hard to impress others. All of those values are things that right wingers do not want taught to their children.",LivingIndependence,2025-03-30T20:15:38,4
"I was fortunate enough to be raised on Sesame Street. I was 2 when it first appeared on TV. It's a part of my identity. No lie. Hippie parents, lots of time in front of the TV yada yada yada.  I don't know how popular the show still is, but it definitely molded my morals to include empathy and equality. To potentially take that away from kids?   I'm just glad I probably won't live long enough to see the consequences.",DonnieT-Diablo,2025-03-30T20:43:59,4
