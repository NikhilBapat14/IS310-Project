"Authorities with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, earlier this month in Vermont. U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release following a hearing Wednesday morning.  ""I'm not afraid of you,"" Mahdawi declared in a message to President Donald Trump as he left the courthouse.  According to the court filing, Mahdawi co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at Columbia in the fall of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack. He founded the group with Mahmoud Khalil, another pro-Palestinian activist who was detained by federal immigration officials under the Trump administration earlier this year.

The activist judge released him solely to give the Trump administration a loss on something, and has zero concerns for the safety of the US or international politics.",Ghosttwo,2025-04-30T12:00:52,60
