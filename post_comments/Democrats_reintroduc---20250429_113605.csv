I didn’t realize that more than 850 anti-lgbtq+ bills have been filed this year alone. Yikes.,rjrae720,2025-04-29T12:20:56,20
"This will put Republicans on record about their view of the LGBTQIA+, as if we didn’t already know. I still don’t get how there are log cabin republicans, either.",Ancient_Popcorn,2025-04-29T11:45:50,29
"Alright republican voters that swear Republicans aren't racist and don't care about people sexuality, your up, call your representatives and tell them how your a good Christian that loves everybody and Republicans aren't NAZIS.",a_little_hazel_nuts,2025-04-29T12:21:13,5
"Sounds like we need another Civil Rights Movement.   Republican politicians are hellbent on removing our most basic rights, it is literally the only thing they are putting any effort into. Americans need to be angrier that this evil nonsense is taking up years of our lives.",SuperLuigiUnited,2025-04-29T17:09:17,5
"This is simultaneously inspiring and hopeful to know we haven't been completely forgotten but also terrifying because I fear we have little chance of this going anywhere good.      I can already hear the ""but muh free speech"" arguments. or the ""oh woe is me I am such an oppressed straight white normal person""      Listen, I don't care about your free speech. You can call me what ever slur you want, it's a free country. But it's also a free country that I don't have to listen or care. I just want to live in my little circle of friends, keep access to my life saving medication and keep being me.     It stops being free speech when I can't find a job because companies won't hire me because they are afraid of what might happen to them.  Not because of my own merit but because they don't want to risk the wrath of an oppressive government.   And it stops being a free country when my anxiety, fear and grief keep me up at night because I don't know if I have a future because my access to the medication that I require to thrive is threatened.",Jushara_iiskra,2025-04-29T11:56:47,6
"I'm trans and I want to be strong and help America, but the thought of just leaving this cess pit is so comforting, that maybe they aren't as crazy in other countries.",ShoppingDismal3864,2025-04-29T19:30:25,3
"So the best democrats can do when it comes to standing up for basic human rights is to limply put forth a bill that they know will never pass? Great job, everyone. I'm sure republicans will recognize the error of their ways. ",Bakedads,2025-04-29T12:08:02,5
"For those people who say who cares about LGBTQ+ rights.  What makes you think that your rights are safe?  Free speech used to be for everyone in America.  That's no longer true if you have a VISA or Green Card.  You can be arrested and deported just like that.  They are already talking about deporting citizens.  Do you feel safe, really?",Troubled202,2025-04-29T22:52:26,1
"And they do this *now*, when there is absolutely no chance of it happening.",Vadion,2025-04-29T12:28:24,1
"Yeah, we've been sounding the alarm because it's like 2000 over the last five years. It's been absolutely terrifying and the primary reason you see trans people fighting so fucking hard.  Throwing us in mens prisons gets trans women raped. Men's bathrooms? Raped and murdered. Kicking us out of sports? Removes a large amount of socialization with other girls. ""Just play with the boys"" implies that the sport is the point, and not competing, collaborating, and building trust and relationships with other girls, which is the *real* point of sports.  But all of these are extreme things that they can get away with because people do not understand trans health and do not want to understand. They don't understand that transition early saves money and lives, and a tremendous amount of suffering. They don't understand that the surgeries we get may seem cosmetic but improve our quality of life so dramatically that they are considered life saving. Or that many surgeries aren't necessary when you get to transition early. That being able to pass often imparts safety from hatred and discrimination, often violent and lethal in most places on earth, yet alone in the US.  We are desperate. My friends are dying. My people aggrieved and at risk of further death. We have nowhere to run. Many of us have started arming ourselves because the stated goal of this fascist state is to kill us or throw us into camps to be killed because they view our very existence as pornographic.  While this is going on, trans women make less than any other group in the US, despite many of us having high education and trade skills. The discrimination pushes us out of jobs faster than everyone else, but when it doesn't? We make a little more than half over time than cis men do when normalized to ability and job title.  They will kill us. It's really that simple. They will kill as many of us as they can, and that swhat these laws are about.  Isolate, remove all safeties, remove healthcare that keeps us stable, put us in direct risk of things that other women kill themselves over at high rates, and let it rip. Then gloat about how many of us kill ourselves, when they purposely made things so bad that we felt that was our only option.",QaraKha,2025-04-29T14:02:33,26
Yea..there is a list of them all... It's terrifying. it feels like nowhere is safe.

Stockholm syndrome is why there are log cabin republicans. This is why addressing your childhood trauma is important if you don’t want to learn to trust un-trustworthy people.,RubArtistic4683,2025-04-29T13:12:58,6
"Race is already a protected category. The bill likely had enough support to pass a couple years ago if it solely added sexual orientation. The addition of gender identity turned out to be the poison pill though.   While it’s a nice gesture, this bill won’t pass anytime soon principally for the same reason.",Ok-Conversation2707,2025-04-29T12:51:44,-7
"I mean, YEAH. That's about the limit of their current legal power.",RebornGod,2025-04-29T12:30:31,3
