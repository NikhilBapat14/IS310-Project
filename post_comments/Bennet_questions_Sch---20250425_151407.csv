"Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet on Friday urged fellow Democrats to think carefully about the party’s top brass — including whether New York Sen. Chuck Schumer is the right leader for Senate Democrats.  While Bennet stopped short of calling for Schumer to step down, Bennet said the party must be “constantly” assessing party leadership and needs “to figure out where we’ve let people down.” He also encouraged Democrats to embrace “a new generation of leaders” nationally.  Bennet noted that he was the first Democrat to appear on national television after former US President Joe Biden’s disastrous June debate against Donald Trump, and that he had predicted at the time that the party would “lose in a landslide if he stayed on the ticket.”  “Turned out we basically lost in the landslide anyway,” Bennet told Semafor’s Burgess Everett at the World Economy Summit in Washington, DC. “We’re going to have to correct that. And it’s going to require us to make some uncomfortable decisions.”  The Democratic Party “has been repudiated,” he said, and must offer voters a more compelling vision for the country.

"If nothing else, there need to be term limits for House and Senate leaders (as in, okay, you've served for 8 years as Senate leader, that's 4 election cycles, you can no longer be Senate leader even if you're still in the Senate). No more of this shit. The parties can make these rules on a dime and force rotations. I'd also say it could be worth calling votes annually to reaffirm support of those leaders.",alabasterskim,2025-04-25T15:56:49,3

"Schumer was good during normal times, even very good.  But these aren't normal times.  While I, in a way, agree that the govt shut down would have hurt Democrats and helped the Trump/Musk administration, Schumer handled it *terribly*, on both the messaging, and on how he personally conducted it.  There are better Democrats who can lead the Senate, he should step down as leader and then retire when his term is up (or earlier).",atreeismissing,2025-04-25T21:49:41,1
