How do you get a troublemaker out of the way?   You promote them to be in charge of a cubicle.   Or work at the UN.,TheIncredibleHork,2025-05-01T13:43:24,136
I got two CNBC notifications while on the stationary bike. One for Waltz getting fired for the Signal chat. One for him getting nominated as ambassador to the UN.   Big WTF moment,According_To_Me,2025-05-01T15:11:29,27
Watch the west wing to understand.   You essentially promote someone to a completely useless and irrelevant job. They can either deal with it or quit.,MeLlamoKilo,2025-05-01T14:07:02,17

yep UN Ambassador position is basically the equivalent of sending Milton to the basement in Office Space. The guy who has been a thorn is going to be out of DC in a position that has literally 0 power over anything.,-DizzyPanda-,2025-05-01T15:54:13,32
