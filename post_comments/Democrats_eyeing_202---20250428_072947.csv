You can talk to disenfranchised young men without courting the incel “women won’t fuck me so they must suffer” vote,Fickle_Rub7156,2025-04-28T07:33:57,85
"I think that Democrats/Progressives need to be willing to reach ANYBODY, if they want to be the party of inclusion.   You can't call out the hypocrisy of ""pro-life"" people who don't back social programs designed to help families, and then say ""we want to help everyone... Who thinks the same as us.""  This is also not a suggestion to accept unacceptable words or behavior. The nuance here is that human rights should be universal AND when we get misguided people into the tent, we have a chance to change their minds. It's going to mean taking the time and effort to interact with unsavory people, but that's what's required to deprogram people.",Awesome_Bob,2025-04-28T12:55:53,5
Find another way to win. It’s not worth it.  Making deals with the devil is how the republicans ended up with Trump. Even just showing up legitimizes this garbage.  Dems need to open their eyes to see what’s driving people to the extremes and fix those problems. Not pander to it.,zenmogwai,2025-04-28T10:18:35,7
"This is good. Democrats have done a terrible job so far of using alternative media to get their message out.  Thet should also put some images of white men on their website, democrats.org.",aninjacould,2025-04-28T12:51:51,5
"Lmfao, hell no. This is just like courting republicans, except worse. Sure let's attract the most toxic people.",Techiesarethebomb,2025-04-28T11:22:52,5
I would say meet these people where they are... But be very careful about legitimizing them. The best thing you can do is disprove the republican fed mythos regarding democrats,ReleaseFromDeception,2025-04-28T18:45:31,1
"It’s amazing to me how so many Reddit democrats find reasons to not try to get the votes of men, and how they think democrats can still win not just by writing off huge demographics, but by actively alienating them with insulting rhetoric. It’s just insane doubling-down of the mentality that boosted Trump back into the WH.",Own-Implement-3300,2025-04-28T11:08:44,-5
"Ok, but we need to define what “disenfranchised” means here.  Because a lot of young men who think they are actually aren’t.  So a lot of what needs to happen is some deprogramming of some brainwashed young men.",Eradicator_1729,2025-04-28T08:06:28,37
Sort of. The incel swing vote among GenZ men was 28 percent.  That’s huge.,Old_Baldi_Locks,2025-04-28T08:21:52,7
"Yes and no... the right wing has been catering and expanding the incel/red pill movement with young men for a good ten years now, targeting the youth who were far too young to understand what propaganda was being beamed into their brains. It is very much a not insignificant size of young white men. The left has done hardly anything whatsoever to counteract or provide any alternative.",__M-E-O-W__,2025-04-28T10:26:45,7
"You can court the vote of someone, for example, with an economic message, without validating their worst beliefs, for example, the belief that “women should suffer because they won’t fuck me.” The “party of inclusion” is way too willing to say “we don’t want your vote if you have any one of many beliefs we find offensive.” That’s no way to win.",Own-Implement-3300,2025-04-28T13:25:47,-1

Democrats progressives have legitimized and excuse bigoted misandric comments. Don’t throw stones in class houses,InternetPositive6395,2025-04-28T21:47:26,0
People don’t want to hear it. They don’t want to admit that whatever their personal brand of politics is isn’t working.,rjrgjj,2025-04-28T13:11:28,1
"Yup. Case in point: [Democrats.org](http://Democrats.org) has zero photos of white men. Or men, even. WTF?",aninjacould,2025-04-28T12:55:09,1
Easy.   Anyone who thinks the Tate brothers are cool is a lost cause,Chokeman,2025-04-28T08:45:25,17
"150% agree, we need to deprogram the ones gotten to by the tates and fresh and fit’s of the world, they think they’re disenfranchised when honestly they’ve just been sold a bill of goods, sadly I saw that happen with my little brother and I’m still working on bringing him back to reality  To me, disenfranchised is more like the ones who don’t have friends or much of a social life, not bad people, just socially awkward, then they fall into this nonsense because they don’t know any better, and they’re young and maybe grew up with red state education so they don’t have the critical thinking skills to say “this is bullshit”",Fickle_Rub7156,2025-04-28T08:08:01,13
It would help if democrats would call out toxic and hypocritical views that many women have on sex and dating instead off claiming everything is a stereotype,InternetPositive6395,2025-04-28T18:25:13,0
Tim is so far gone... The dude took russian money to promote misinformation. He threw up trumpian propaganda in the white house press room...  Why even talk to him? At this point talking to him is like's talking to steve bannon. I'm looking at you gavin newsom.,ReleaseFromDeception,2025-04-28T18:49:52,0
So you’re telling him that democrats think women never do anything wrong ?,InternetPositive6395,2025-04-28T21:53:58,1
"I mean, the left has plenty of bullshit. We start calling that out and a lot of men will come back.   Like I can say 100% that I would have gone Republican back in 2006ish if I wasn’t black just because of how toxic the way men were talked about on college campuses. Like I literally had middle class white women telling me how good I have it over them as a black man….,because I was a man.  1/2 of the numbers we talk about when it comes to men and women? Dont hold up. The adjusted wage gap is like .96 not .7. Even then, the unadjusted is extremely close for young people.    When discussing actions instead of terms, rates of sexual and domestic violence start to equal out, and thats before going down the emotional violence path.   Women out attend college at rates that are worse than when title 9 was implemented and yet there are no programs trying to increase male college attendance  And thats before getting into how the k-12 education system is completely biased against boys.  So yeah, refusing to see the systematic issues that men are facing as *systematic* like we do for every other group is a big part of what is driving them away.",SandiegoJack,2025-04-28T12:11:30,0
"Why talk to him? To get your message out, that’s why. Traditional media outlets aren’t enough. Newsome was smart to go on his show.",aninjacould,2025-04-28T19:46:11,1
"Like when in 2020 I was running a food drive collection outside a supermarket with two other members of my local org. We just handed out printed lists of items folks should donate if they could.  The woman I’m with gets annoyed after like 10 minutes and says “ugh, of course, the fucking *men* never take a pamphlet. Can’t expect white men to do anything good.”  I’m Latino but I’m white. The other person with us was a white dude. White men were literally doing more in that moment than our woman-majority org.   That rhetoric would made me never show back up if I wasn’t apparently so ~~masochistic~~ committed.",TonyzTone,2025-04-28T17:47:44,1
"Newsom was smart to entertain a ""Roman Salute"" throwin', card carrying literal fascist? That's certainly a bold strategy, I guess?  I understand reach of Tim. I just don't like the optics.",ReleaseFromDeception,2025-04-28T19:49:50,1
