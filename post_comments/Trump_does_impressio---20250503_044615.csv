"Years from now, a modern, civilized country is going to make a movie about trump and his cult.  People are going to think so much is exaggerated and false.  “Did he really do/say that?’  “People believed him and actually liked him?”  Yep.",Kantsas,2025-05-03T04:55:31,65
I would love to see this fat piece of shit actually try to lift a weight,Cool-Presentation538,2025-05-03T05:03:20,35

"Imagine paying thousands in tuition to have to endure this speech at your graduation.   It's probably why there were so many empty seats, and they had to keep that camera zoomed in ultra close because if they panned out, everyone would see that Trump is a disgrace. These students couldn't even celebrate their own successes at their graduation because of him.",Financial-Special766,2025-05-03T07:51:03,7
"He was actually imitating a poor, little weak woman unable to lift weight and compete with transgender athletes. He has used this impression before. He’s an idiot.",yesitsyourmom,2025-05-03T08:43:49,7
"Is there any truth to this? That swimmer that threw the huge fit about the transgender swimmer beating her actually tied for 5th, so what’s this story about?",Paahl68,2025-05-03T08:32:01,8
"Turned a commencement speech into a campaign rally, who saw that coming?",ImLikeReallySmart,2025-05-03T09:12:38,6
Trump's just mad because a woman can lift more than him.,DifferenceAlarmed45,2025-05-03T05:57:42,17
What a laughable impression. Imagine an ancient fatso like Trimp lifting weights.,Psephological,2025-05-03T04:47:00,7
Keeping the focus off of real issues and onto things that he taught the Trumpanzies they need to focus on.  A transgender person in the United States means nothing to the big picture. Most people never even met one.,thomport,2025-05-03T07:27:06,5

MAGA is about to learn the weight of the tariffs so ole' rapist Donny has to break out the classics... get those people mad at something that's nothing so he can keep screwing America.,Tenchi2020,2025-05-03T20:07:09,2
The world sees this… we will not recover from this man,ComprehensiveWin2841,2025-05-03T21:33:04,2
I'd bet real money he just does it so he can take a moment and actually just shit his diaper without having to be subtle about it.,DarthHiccups,2025-05-03T20:10:49,1
I'm sure he'll be History Channel fodder for years to come.,momalloyd,2025-05-03T04:58:24,16
And odds are the necessary lessons won't be learned and they'll make the same mistakes and failures again.,Professional-Buy2970,2025-05-03T12:20:29,3

"They just want someone to belittle and hate, so they picked the group with the smallest numbers. These are just bad people. There is no other reason.",Upper_Reflection_90,2025-05-03T10:09:24,10
Or if they’ve had gender affirming care and a true village of support — you’d never know.,profzoff,2025-05-03T19:25:58,2
"Even an ambitious teenager could do a rough cut since the footage is all out there. How ‘bout a crowd-funded contest to see who can make the most riotous 10-15 minute supercut of **”Trump, In His Own Werds”**",tomparker,2025-05-03T06:17:12,8
"Why would he? He thinks that when you exert yourself, you lose maximum life. He thinks he's a battery. If he lifted a weight, that might take .02 seconds off his life or some shit.",Karf,2025-05-03T14:29:00,3
"Exactly. But unfortunately, they’ve been “made the scapegoat” by a dictator who is trying to acquire votes from a bigoted segment of the population by driving them into the ground;  instead of talking about issues that would make American lives easier That he has no plans on pursuing or instituting.",thomport,2025-05-03T20:37:12,2
