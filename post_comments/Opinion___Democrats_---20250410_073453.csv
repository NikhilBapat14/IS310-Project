"I’m a Democrat, I don’t want to be rich, I just want to not have to worry that if I get sick I won’t lose everything!!! I don’t need a yacht, I don’t need a second home. I need the ability to keep food in my fridge and to be able to upkeep my home and the ability to go to the Dr. if sick. And take a trip once in awhile. Oh and clean air and water and a planet that is allowed to heal!",trucer1963,2025-04-10T08:04:45,37
"Which Americans? The already wealthy who have their ears and donate to them, or the working and impoverished classes that continue to shout and are patently ignored by most Democrats?  Furthermore, I don't care about being rich. I just want a functioning government that does what is just and ethical, and takes care of those who can't take care of themselves because the system threw them overboard decades ago. I want the politicians to grow up and have some goddamn integrity and class and not bow to corporate interests. I'm asking a lot, I know.",Dyne2057,2025-04-10T08:44:26,5

"The Democrats can't even get out of their own way when it comes to permitting and land use. To allow people to build homes in 90+% of their own cities pushing their electoral votes into the suburbs and rural areas locking people out of the economic advantages of density, transit, and walkability. They have been talking about these topics for 25 years and are just now making progress in limited areas.   If the Democrats want to be taken seriously they need to get out of their own way and end protectionism for crippling 80 year bad ideas rather than waiting for everyone receiving the benefits of bad planning to literally die off for generational change. The Democrats cannot effectively change the direction of the perverbial.battleship.",[deleted],2025-04-10T10:00:21,2
That would require party members actually learn economics and understand the insidious nature of too much inflation.   As a litmus test how many believe the ONLY influence on the covid times inflation was price gouging?,slo1111,2025-04-10T07:48:33,3

"""Rich"" is such a subjective thing as well. Rich in money? In love? Friends? Security? So many equate it to having a lot of money, but that is always to just solve other problems. If we can tackle society's basic needs, then being ""rich"" won't matter to most.",VenturaDreams,2025-04-10T22:15:34,2

"Exactly, I am on the older side so I remember when those things were a normal part of life for lower middle class people( I was raised lower middle class), It really pisses me off the economic world we have created for our children and grandchildren. I try to be optimistic but not sure this economic way is sustainable.",trucer1963,2025-04-10T08:24:50,5
"I have and folks like AOC have never acknowledged pumping out so much money especially to those of us who remained employed created such demand in a supply constrained environment so that it greatly increased the prices of almost everything.   We need leaders who understand the nuance of unintended consequence,  if we are going to ever get handle on the debt and not have it blow up into a crisis one day.",slo1111,2025-04-10T08:25:31,-3

"When Dems are in charge, the debt goes down and the economy improves even as government money is spent building things and helping people.   When r’s are in charge, the debt goes up and services are cut so the uber-wealthy can have more tax breaks, leading to a stagnant economy because most Americans can’t afford the basics, much less anything extra.   Every time.",PraxisLD,2025-04-10T08:50:44,1
I don't know of these people you referring to that were told they can't work and have to sit at home and starve. Plus that was during Trumpxs admin.   A better approach to see how we handled covid would be to understand what % of Americans remained remained gainfully employed that received thousands of $ and what did we do to help supply side to mitigate risks.   All we got was lip service that inflation was transitory and a new wave of checks including to people who were back at work.,slo1111,2025-04-10T08:45:01,-2

"You’re calling out the Dems for “sure things cost a little more but at least I have money to spend” and totally ignoring “shit, I just got laid off and my retirement savings has been completely decimated and I’m worried about being deported even though I was born here.”  These two things are not the same…",PraxisLD,2025-04-10T09:21:01,1
It matters because we took over the executive branch and never lifted a finger to ease inflation until it was too late and we lost the next election.  The entire denial piece of it is why and I surmise that denial comes from ignorance of our leaders when it comes to economics,slo1111,2025-04-10T08:56:12,-1
"I thought I was rather clear that my gripe was sending money to the majority of Americans who remained gainfully employed.  Not certain how you missed that.   Rather than getting hyper defensive, I call all dems to apply some skepticm to give an honest assessment. It is the only way we can get better",slo1111,2025-04-10T09:25:42,2

My complaint is not the end result.  It was the delay recognizing it as a problem.   As well as omitting key mitigation efforts that could have helped such as better supporting small businesses,slo1111,2025-04-10T09:07:28,1
