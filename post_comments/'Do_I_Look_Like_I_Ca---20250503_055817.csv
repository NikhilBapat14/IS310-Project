"Because there are 50 people making the same stupid comments about AOC like she's done something. It's so dumb. Every article about her gets tons of upvotes on reddit and the same folks saying all this stuff about her that doesn't have anything to do with reality.   It's like when Jasmine Crockett called Abbott a bigoted slur, and reddit went wild, claiming that was ""true leadership"". It's so dumb. She had a thousand ways she could have attacked his policies and the things he does that are awful but instead she chose to be ableist and make Dems look like the bigoted ones.   Or even like Pelosi when she clapped sarcastically for trump and reddit pretended it was brilliant. It did literally nothing to stop him but reddit acted like she had just impeached him all by herself or something.   So I ask again, how does this help? To me it seems like literally the only thing AOC does is make snarky comments that get her a strong tiktok following and then her fans spend more time attacking the DNC over things they made up than they do attacking trump over things that actually happen.   It doesn't seem organic either. I just keep reliving the 2024 election when the Democratic Socialists of America told all of their followers to not vote for Harris for stupid reasons that were incredibly similar to russian propaganda, and now we have trump as president again.   And on top of that, when you actually talk to trump voters (I know you guys consider that treason so you don't do it), all of the reasons they say they vote for him are stuff that people like AOC keep pushing.

"Nobody is pushing for surgeries for trans youth or teachers transing kids in secret. Those are things that don't happen that Republicans made up. People like AOC because she actually does do more than make snarky comments. She's touring to rally people for progressive causes and getting huge turnout, she brings tons of money for her district, she beat an incumbent in multiple leadership roles in the primary to win and did it all without corporate money.   AOC outperformed Harris in 2024, and people with her similar policies had similar results. And to be honest, every attack against the DNC is totally justified, they neutered Walz, touted Liz Cheney, and people like Yglesias and Carville keep pushing Dems to be diet Republicans despite that strategy failing over and over and over again. The DNC is also largely responsible for boosting MAGA in the first place. And sadly, it is that centrist Blue Dog mentality that helped Trump win a second time. Republicans were pulling all sorts of voter suppression left and right and Merrick Garland refused to do anything about it, and as a result 4.5 million ballots across key states were tossed out. I'm not happy Harris lost, but I'm also not happy that Dem leadership created that situation in the first place. If you want Dems to win, then you need to do anything possible to change the party at a fundamental level, people have been getting sick of ""Vote Blue No Matter Who"" for quite some time and at some point somethingg's gotta give. And trolling people for supporting AOC is just not it. People are fed up with do-nothing corporate Dems, people are begging Chuck Schumer to resign, people like David Parkman and the talking head at the NYT, CNN, MSNBC, etc. are hemorrhaging views and subscribers and people like AOC actually fight for things people need and are asking for.",papibigdaddy,2025-05-03T18:18:32,2

"American political journalism has not been very good in a long, long time.  Two things really hamstring it: 1) the belief that they need access to do the reporting and 2) the absurd need to seem unbiased.  This is why, when Republican American presidents get interviewed by UK or Irish reporters, there's often outrage on the right ([George W Bush on RTE](https://youtu.be/M35V7SniAIc?si=ue8NCtNDMGh3kB2X) comes to mind, but [that Axios interview Jonathan Swan did with Trump](https://youtu.be/yJIhxKFH9gI?si=u6s0dFD28B5rwU0s) was also a doozy).  Europe engages in a kind of adversarial journalism and will absolutely hold a politician's feet to the fire‚Äîand if they refuse to a question, the interviewer will just put words in their mouth and force them to either accept or deny them.  I'm a firm believer that the failures of American political journalism are killing us.",midwinter_,2025-05-03T18:40:30,3

"If America were yearning for the far left so much why do progressives only hold like 2% of seats in Congress? They can't win in anything but the darkest blue districts in the nation, like AOC's.   And yes, teachers are doing that stuff. Calling trans kids by their trans names and whatnot without parental consent. Giving them pro-trans reading material without parental consent. Morals aside, voters hate that so much they voted for the fat orange clown. And thousands of trans kids get top surgery before they turn 18. Voters do not like that and Dems supporting it bleeds votes.   >People are fed up with do-nothing corporate Dems  Those ""do nothing Dems"" like Newsom are the ones stopping trump in court while people like AOC and Crockett just make sound bytes to get in dumb headlines like this. That does literally nothing to stop trump.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-03T22:57:53,0
"""Blue no matter who"" was a promise to vote for Bernie if he won the primary, because he's a Democrat (or at least he was in the primary and is far better than any republican) and we desperately wanted to beat trump.   Meanwhile the far left is like ""If we don't get our exact candidate, we refuse to vote for anyone else so you get to deal with trump."" And now those people who refused to vote for Harris for dumb reasons complain that trump is president.   Angry socialists on reddit keep pushing all this propaganda that it means something else, like that we are saying somebody else has to vote blue no matter who it is or something? All that phrase ever meant was that Dems were showing solidarity and would vote for Bernie, Biden, Warren, or anyone who won the primary because literally any of them were light years better than trump.   And I'd certainly vote for AOC if she won the Dem primary. She's a million times better than anyone republicans have dredged up in the past 50 years or so. But she'd lose because the center wouldn't vote for her. Swing states won't vote for someone who calls themselves a socialist. A ton of Latino-Americans won't because they fled socialist countries that were nightmares.",Constant-Kick6183,2025-05-03T23:07:08,0
