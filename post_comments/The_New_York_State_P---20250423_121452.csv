I have never been a fan of gang databases its way to easy to get added on to them for things like maybe a family member is a gang member or a old friend. Even just living in a gang neighborhood. Not to mention police often rely on questionable markers like clothing or tatoos.,sedatedlife,2025-04-23T12:21:13,3

"They need more armed men to grab children off the street - go to gang members, get men who agree with ICE.",Legitimate_Eye8494,2025-04-23T12:41:18,-1
"Right, it's an end-run around due process.  The State Police just want them all gone and are trying to use ICE to deport them without evidence/trial or even charges.  Authoritarians are, above all, *lazy*.  They are not willing to do the work and jump straight to the outcome they want.  Everyone will just assume that if you made ""the list"" then you deserve it and are a bad person.  It's why we need to treat *everyone* with the same amount of basic respect according to the Constitution.  You or your family could be next on ""the list"" or another list like it.",UnknownAverage,2025-04-23T12:39:11,5
