"If you watch tape on Trump interviews going back to the 80s, he isn’t that bright. As soon as someone asks him a follow up question on just about anything, he can’t answer the question. In 2016 Bob Woodward interviewed him when he was the front runner in the primaries. He published the audio on the audiobook for his most recent release, “War”.  This was Trump’s answer when asked about Abraham Lincoln:  “""Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time”  It’s like he was the kid faking book reports in junior high and because he was/is rich, nobody has ever called him on his bullshit.",tg19801980,2025-05-04T07:16:09,1234

"While both Biden and Trump have shown signs that raise questions about cognitive function, the manifestations differ: Biden, during his presidential term, appeared more prone to states of confusion, but seemed somewhat self aware of these states and would often seek clarification from who he was talking to to regain his footing in a conversation -  Asking questions and making clear he doesn't always have all the answers. Biden would often walk back statements or issue clarifications afterwards. His humility helped provide guardrails against dangerous and impulsive abuses of power.   In contrast, Trump seems to cope by simply doubling down on whatever assertion he makes while trying to conceal his own lack of understanding. He will fabricate a clearly wrong answer and then repeat it over and over and get all of his cabinet leaders to double down and repeat his assertions without any acknowledgment of potential errors. This seemingly obsessive need to be viewed as always right and never wrong has led Trump to make numerous, disastrous decisions in a very short time. His vindictiveness towards anyone he views as trying to correct or contradict him has caused the majority Republican leadership to play along and indulge in his madness.",Oddman80,2025-05-04T07:09:47,48

He never sounded saner than Biden.   People just accepted that he sounds and behaves like a toddler.   Trump fans cheered for him anyway because they believe someone with the mind of a toddler is a genius.   100 stories about Biden tripping or stuttering would sell to Trump fans. Even if it the same story over and over again Trump fans would buy it.   And stories about Trump? Well you won’t sell any bad story about Trump to his fans and others won’t need 100 stories that repeat the same shit over and over.

"These are things that we should not dismiss. We all make mistakes here and there, but at his age things that are indicative of mental decline or early onset of dementia cannot be ignored. Since they could have physical causes, they should have been addressed in his annual Physical and perhaps they were but not released. Illness or conditions are not character flaws or things that should be hidden. We all have medical issues of some kind and they increase with age and we as citizens deserve to be informed. Mental issues can be related to physical issues or the aging process or they could be isolated enough to be treated separately. Again, this is not a judgement of the person other than within the limits of physical and cognitive tests that are important to perform the job. Illness, whether temporary or progressive and need to be followed and addressed. There is too much at stake and this is not political. If he has health or cognitive issues, then they need to be monitored so he can get any help he needs. We all get the occasional name or word wrong or have moments of confusion, which are usually not a problem, but we also aren’t in a position of power where they need to be taken very seriously just to have a record to know if they are normal occasionally gaffs or any ongoing pattern.  Several recent statements, answers to questions (whether direct or evasive), wrong word usage, and reading off a prepared text in a matter that seems like the first time he’s ever seen the information are within our rights to be concerned about. Going way off topic, repeating something already covered, things like confusing Harlem with Harvard, and mental lapses or moments of silence, are valid concerns.   Mental or cognitive things may be related to physical conditions or medications and they should always be the first associations to make. But, some physical issues may be symptoms of cognitive decline or onset of dementia. Issues with walking, balance, using the podium as crutch, and seemingly small things that only trained professionals would notice should not be ignored, especially at older ages. The cognitive test he takes is a bare minimum that anyone in any position to make major decisions should be required to take to look for things that are over the basic thresholds. Those in positions of power should also be given other tests to measure basic reading comprehension and logical conclusions and simple math word problems, that the cognitive test does not attempt to cover.   Just release the actual results of the yearly physical with normal redactions. We can handle it. Winning golf tournaments (that are suspect in the first place) as an indicator of fitness is insulting to our intelligence. Grip tests, treadmill stress tests, and balance testing are very good indicators of mortality and longevity. We don’t need detail, but valid concerns are within our need to know.   This keeping all results from us and claiming absolute physical health beyond the expected levels of someone much younger just comes off as hiding important information. A valid and accurate health assessment without violating patient confidentiality is not a lot to ask for. Nor is a general list of medications. We don’t need to know the specifics or drugs or dosages, but being on blood thinners or other categories is relevant. The bruises on his hands look very similar to what some people experience on blood thinners, but we shouldn’t be having to speculate on what could be easily explained.",Mike-ggg,2025-05-04T08:30:16,2

"Trump is and has always been a bullshitter.  Bullshitters, as philosopher Harry Frankfurt wrote in his 1986 essay:  “On Bullshit,” Bullshitters don’t care whether what they are saying is factually correct or not. Instead, bullshit is characterized by a “lack of connection to a concern with truth \[and\] indifference to how things really are.” Frankfurt explains that a bullshitter “does not care whether the things he says describe reality correctly. He just picks them out, or makes them up, to suit his purpose.”  #   In addition to being unconcerned about the truth (which liars do care about, since they are trying to conceal it), Frankfurt suggests that bullshitters don’t really care whether their audience believes what they are saying. Indeed, getting the audience to believe something is false isn’t the goal of bullshitting. Rather, bullshitters say what they do in an effort to change how the audience sees them, “to convey a certain impression” of themselves.

Also, many credible sources say that Trump sounds saner one-on-one in private. Whereas Biden avoided being evaluated in that way by his critics.  Recently, Bill Maher and Jeff Goldberg both had private meetings with Trump recently.  Trump has psychological problems. Trump puts on a crazy show in person for the purpose of keeping support of his base. Trump adapts to his target audience.  Biden seems to have aphasia that makes it hard for him to speak extemporaneously, particularly when he is in an adversarial situation.

To compare his shortcomings directly to Biden's is feeble. Trump has a bajillion other things than slurred speech and poor memory to be genuinely be afraid of - don't  make a direct comparison with Biden. Biden is not a convicted felon, for one, so why use the same measuring stick with Trump? A hardcore Trump fan can hear he's more lucid and they will latch on to that if given the opportunity.

More and more makeup is needed every time he gets out in public to hide his quickly wilting skin. He's very clearly got dementia, among several other mental issues, and he freezes or loops his speech a lot. I wouldn't at all be surprised if he's hid a stroke or two.   Put simply, he looks like my great-grandpa did in the years of his life where he was very lucky to be able to still enjoy his hobbies. He talks like my grandmother does, and she's been bedridden for 3 years and will never walk again.   But as we've seen too many times in congress, old politicians never retire. They work themselves to death or pretend to work as their bones freeze up instead of enjoying their last years as they should. He can still be in politics a long time, even if he can no longer remember what he said in the morning and has next to no grasp on reality.

"Alzheimer’s and Dementia runs in Donald’s family. His father withered away into goop around this age  and its Donald deepest fear of that happening to him and Losing power. It’s what he did.   “The incident, Mary L. Trump said, left Donald Trump visibly upset at his father’s descent into dementia, which medical records show had been diagnosed several years earlier. Trump reflected his anguish in an interview around that time, with Playboy in 1997 reporting that seeing his father “addled with Alzheimer’s” had left him wondering “out loud about the senselessness of life.”  Donald is no doubt fearful of Alzheimer’s,” said a former senior executive at the Trump Organization, who worked for years with Trump and saw him interact with Fred Trump Sr., and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a confidential relationship. “He’s not going to talk about and not going to admit to it. But it’s relevant because every day he is hitting Biden with whether or not he is capable mentally of doing the job.”  Trump’s father’s condition also drove a wedge into his family, which fell into years of lawsuits that alleged in part that Donald Trump sought to take advantage of his father’s dementia to wrest control of the family estate — litigation that introduced reams of medical records detailing Fred Trump Sr.’s condition.”  https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/20/donald-trump-dementia-father-fred-alzheimers-biden/",Oceanbreeze871,2025-05-04T12:49:29,2

"I think it goes further than that.  I think the intended outcome is to turn the US into a full on oligarchy.  It will allow the .01% to buy up litterally everything, as all the other companies are beld dry or bankrupted, forcing their sale for pennies, or have their stock prices so depressed, and the average citizen bled soo dry their forced to cash out anything they own to survive.      The plan, IMO, is to allow a select few to buy up anything of relevance and create a russia- like oligarchy but in reverse- in Russia the oligarchs provide Putin with consent, but. Are ultimately under him- he ha ded them their wealth in the first place- through granting of state monolpolies.  If they go against him,  they are ultimately replaceable-  Putin can have then assassinated and it's normalized and accepted, and when he does, he transfers their wealth and power to a new psychophant.      The plan for America is for the oligarchs to legitimately own all the levers of power, and, I'm convinced, after trump, have them being the only ones able to install a new figurehead, whose impeachment they can manufacture at any time.   To this end, I think the tarif whiplash is completely intentional, and nescessary.  First, it creates an extra early opportunity for those on the inside to generate huge amounts of wealth- to power their buyout.  There's a couple  charts floating around showing this:   before his announcement of policy reversals, theirs a huge volume of insider trading, at least one of them reflecting Billions in wealth transfer.      Second, it acted as a proof of concept, showing the .01s they **have** to buy in to the cabal- just having the cash isn't enough.  Him being able to control the market short term via tarrifs means they can't just ride out the market tanking and buy up the distressed property/ stocks- they need the insider info, and to be told when to buy or sell,  or trump will just switch positions killing any major buy they make,  and that neither holding stock or cash is safe, as either pool can devalued at a whim (cash reserves via inflation and decreasing dolar value) it's also demonstrated that corporations CAN buy in- for a price, they can buy a tarif exemption or carveout.   Finally, it falsely extends hope and complacency.  He's shown us tarrifs can dissappear at any point and time.   This extended hope seems to have successfully kept a good portion of the 'little guys' in the game- not wanting to sell at a loss for fear the tariffs will suddenly dissappear and stocks shoot back up  before they have a chance to buy in at currently deflated prices.    This also prevents the market from looking like a 1930s era crash- which would have a large percentage of the 99% rioting in the streets.    By periodically reversing course on tarifs, he'll be able to  slowly ride the economy into the ground, to the Oligarch's buy-up point, boiling us all into our indentured servitude like the proverbial frog.   This also has a similar effect on international economics- it's an attempt to keep other countries from outright abandoning us in every sphere- the oligarchs are okay with losing American hegemony, but don't want to be left controlling an irrelevant pariah.",iordseyton,2025-05-04T10:25:02,7

He was constantly misspeaking and incoherent.  I believe Harris would have won without the constant assault from the propaganda network that is Fox News. I talk to my elderly neighbor regularly and *everything* she “knew” about Harris and Walz was straight from Fox. Harris slept her way to the top. Harris never prosecuted anyone herself. Walz deserted his Reserve unit.

"I think that he doesn't command the fear / respect from other R pols that Trump does.   I think that this was part of why he was chosen: There are several maga pols who seem to think of themselves as the heir apparent/ second magaest politician behind trump, although Desantis is the only name coming to mind otoh.    In order not slight any of them, or risk party infighting, trump chose a nobody as his second.   That way trump could tell them all behind closed doors, 'we all know you're the real most dedicated maga but we need you to keep your position, long languishing away in obscurity, and Vance is just a spot filler'  (I dont think this was the only reason, I think another major factor was Pence- who as an actual politician who knew how things worked, gave trump a little too much push back and threat to his legitimacy- the threat of the party gettong sick of his outsidership and ditching him for Pence in his first term was a little too real of a leash for him)   In addition, I don't think he has the 'oligarchs' (the billionaire donor shot callees) Hes Thiel's boy- so he's got Thiels support, but most Pols are co-owned by many 'donors'.  I think all the ones who don't own him would see this connection as a liability to their own power.  I think, should something happen to Trump, a Vance presidency would last about a month or 2- just long enough for the billionaires to pick a  new,  mutually controlled puppet, and whip  the party's top candidates back into line behind them.  Vance would then be forced to nominate that candidate as his replacement VP, and shortly after resign, be impeached, or face a 25th challenge as unfit- backdooring the oligarchs new man into office.",iordseyton,2025-05-04T09:14:30,4
