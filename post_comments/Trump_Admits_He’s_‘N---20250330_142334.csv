">That's a problem for 3 1/2 years from now  Yeah, that's the attitude Biden and Garland had about Trump in 2021.  Look what it got us.   Maybe it is a ""gish gallop,"" maybe not.   Maybe all these tyrannical overreaches that Trump is doing are all a distraction from tax cuts, but they are causing mass damage and suffering to people nonetheless.   With Trump, you cannot tell the difference between distracting farce and genuine agenda.   When a person who is already enacting dictatorial salvos says he wants to stay in office longer than he is legally permitted, that cannot be dismissed as irrelevant distraction.",Megalodon481,2025-03-30T16:33:53,4

They‚Äôre trying to kick people out and kick down on others. The motivation becomes clear when we melt it down to that point- we need to stay clear and keep our heads up. Our people and country are counting on it.  Due process issue is easy to see the implication. If government can kick down on any person that it claims to be Venezuelan gang member without receipts, the slippery slope is that they can come after someone who wrote something unappealing about the administration on social media, or even go after someone who has vandalized (language has been intentionally updated to be terrorized) Tesla.",civfan0908,2025-03-31T00:34:50,1
