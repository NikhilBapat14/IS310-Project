He is committing fraud in open plain sight and this is what you guys are reporting on -give me a break. No wonder why we are in this mess. Got to ban you actually report on the corruption in colonialism that is going on.,SoundSageWisdom,2025-05-08T11:27:44,14

"I don’t doubt that **if** Trump were to ever offer candy during Halloween that it would likely be Tootsie Rolls or Butterscotch candies, the two most distusting candies in the mass produced candy world (yes, there are probably worse “candies”, but those two are everywhere). Of course, I also don’t doubt that this asshole wouldn’t open the door for anyone but young girls in skimpy outfits.",AmrokMC,2025-05-08T11:18:21,1
"Trump jokingly refers to his candy as “my alcohol,” according to three sources.  In summoning the candy during his two different stints in the White House, Trump has been known to shout things like:  “Bring me the alcohol!” or, “Gimme the alcohol.”  Read more: https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-candy-addict-white-house-oval-office-1235334441/",rollingstone,2025-05-08T11:32:04,1

Trump is hated to so much by “leftist” neoliberals that it gave them a psychological pathology of sorts.,AssociationUsual212,2025-05-08T11:24:08,-13
I mean similarities to Hitler are kinda cheap at this point but he has to be on a similar amount of stimulants lol,flipflapflupper,2025-05-08T11:53:53,13
Guess that means I am fucked…..as I grab another handful of candy coated gummies…..,NorseYeti,2025-05-08T11:46:13,5
Candy corn wins the horrible candy prize for me. Those hot cinnamon candies come a close second.  There is a good use for tootsie rolls though--for a kids' prank. Put some discreetly in the pool at a pool party. Or in the punch bowl.,ChaskaChanhassen,2025-05-08T11:36:38,8

Trump is a walking pile of unlikeable personality traits.  Why is it such a shocker to you guys that people really just hate the guy.,camopdude,2025-05-08T11:50:21,3
"Trump is hated by everything that doesn't have his cock so far up their ass that their brain no longer functions from the repeated penetration of the cerebral cortex. He's either hated (the correct response) or worshipped (insanity). There's no in between. There is not a single person who's like ""Donald Trump? The rapist, racist, criminal fascist who is creating catastrophe on a global scale? Meh, he's alright"". Nobody. So next time you want to toss around the word pathology, think about what it takes to not only like that person, but view him as a literal deity incapable of wrongdoing.",FuckLibsFukTrumpCult,2025-05-09T14:40:42,1

deeper thoughts than the entire neoliberal establishment. Enjoy four years of pathologically obsessing about the duly elected President.,AssociationUsual212,2025-05-08T11:59:12,-7

I’ve never heard of them. Are they mainly a regional candy?,AmrokMC,2025-05-08T11:50:55,2
I think they were widely available.  They originated in the 1840s and they all tasted like they were made back then too.  Dry discs with powder sugar on them.,camopdude,2025-05-08T11:53:26,3

Kinda like smarties but with more tart flavors.  And they were very thin and about the size of a quarter.  Smarties weren't bad though.,camopdude,2025-05-08T12:06:52,2
It's always so weird hearing people talk about smarties like that. In canada they are candy coated chocolates. Basically  better m&ms,SillyGoatGruff,2025-05-08T12:44:53,2
