"Moves like this might be considered just barely acceptable at West Point–the more accessible of the military academies–but even there this is some dumb shit. The major U.S. military academies are among the most exclusive and elite universities in the country. Most attendees aren't the kind of dumb-dumbs who would be okay with this. Gaining entry to the Naval and Air Force academies, especially, requires that you be the kind of individual who would definitely miss the materials Hegseth is pulling from shelves.  Students at these places can be shitheads like any other college student, but they're still nowhere near as stupid and malleable as Hegseth and Co. believe. Obviously this is just a show of power and prestige, just like his Signal meessages.",ANOKNUSA,2025-04-28T12:37:35,17

"This could not come at a worse time with the war in Ukraine being nearly won by Ukraine, China inching closer towards expanding into Taiwan, Mexico looking increasingly unstable.  This is a time for projecting cautious strength, not stupid crazy.",lord_pizzabird,2025-04-28T12:29:42,3
