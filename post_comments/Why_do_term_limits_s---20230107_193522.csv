"There are two main things to unpack here. First, the spectrum of autocratic vs. democratic isn't really a real thing. That's basically borrowing from the political compass, which is complete hokum, to put it kindly. The opposite of democracy is not authority. In fact, every system of government actually depends on authority to a certain extent, *especially* democracy. If you did some better study and read some quality political books, this will never be a real axis around which to think about political cleavages. It's purely something made up by libertarians to make them sound better.  Second, term limits aren't really being pushed by anyone who has any understanding of how political behavior actually works and wants it to be effective. Gaetz and crew are anti-government extremists, and when the other side has had folks that are also anti-government extremists then they have both considered this kind of thing, but it's almost objectively a *terrible* idea. This sub has discussed the concept many, many times, and here's the most recent thread explaining why term limits are an awful idea: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask\_Politics/comments/10661ll/why\_do\_term\_limits\_seem\_to\_be\_both\_a\_leftright/",mormagils,2023-01-09T08:47:03,8
"Lobbyists like term limits.  The less time politicians are in office, the less institutional knowledge they have, and the more they have to rely on lobbyists.  Lobbyists lobby republicans and democrats alike. And it polls well.",pluralofjackinthebox,2023-01-09T21:23:42,3
"Term limits was originally adopted by conservatives when the Dems had a VERY stable and long term majority in Congress.   One of those long timers was sitting House Speaker Tom Foley from Eastern Washington, who lost to George Nethercutt in 1994.  Nethercutt ran on a pro-term limits platform and promised to serve only three terms.  Of course, he broke that promise and served for five terms and then quit the House to run for the Senate.  When he quit, Republican Cathy McMorris Rogers took over and she's been there since 2004 so she's going on 10 terms.  So much for term limits in that part of the world.   The idea with term limits is that the longer people are in D.C. the more they get co-opted by lobbyists and special interests.  There is certainly some truth to that.    The counter is that if you've got a bunch of inexperienced people in Congress, the lobbyists and special interests are going to have even more power.  There is also some truth to that.    The problem is that no party, once in power, wants to give up safe seats by having term limits.",phreeeman,2023-01-09T18:32:13,2
"Term limits for POTUS happened because Republicans never wanted to deal with another FDR...just when they had found their very own potential President for Life in DDE. Fact is, it takes some time to understand how the system works, so having several terms in House or Senate is not automatically a bad thing.   A better solution to the current problems would be to abolish the filibuster in the Senate and require any proposed legislation with a near majority (9/16ths?) of sponsors to go to the floor of the House for a vote. Better still,  make all funding bills automatically increase the debt ceiling by a like amount as soon as they become Law.",Olderscout77,2023-01-09T10:38:18,1
"It's a simple concrete proposal that everyone understands and is universally popular. Its basically something that you can throw out there to make it sound like you ""on the side of the people"" but doesn't really threaten anyone, and no one is really going to hold you to it.",loselyconscious,2023-01-10T03:38:24,1
"Term limits would give more opportunities to the far right (and potentially, the far left, though the left of late is not nearly as interested in this issue) to gain power. This is largely because incumbents are supported by the party apparatus, so while it is possible to dethrone an incumbent by being wildly further right, the money and logistical strength held by the incumbent are usually too dominant to succeed.  But if legislators were prohibited from running after X terms, it would keep a reliable stream of incumbency-free seats for the Gaetzes of the world to go after, instead of constantly trying to take down establishment candidates from the outside.  (The strategy of primarying a sitting legislator from the more extreme side isn't limited to the Right - it's how AOC got her seat a few years back, but I don't believe that she was advocating for term limits at the time. I could be wrong.)",ZincExtraordinaire,2023-01-10T09:53:18,1
"Yeah, but the far right hated Eisenhower, so that wasn't much of a disincentive for presidential term limits.  Eisenhower was the original RINO to the crazy duPonts, Koch's daddy and others of similar ilk.  The John Birchers thought Eisenhower was a communist plant.",phreeeman,2023-01-09T18:37:03,1
"True, but until jrbush, the crazies were kept at arm's length from the ""levers of power"". jr hired back a bunch of his daddy's craziest advisors and gave them all promotions. They in turn used their new power to knock down a great many ""guard rails"" that had acted to preserve our democracy, most importantly they let the GOPerLords select who got put on the bench which led to Citizens' United and later Dobbs.",Olderscout77,2023-01-10T07:25:11,3
"Yes.  Remember when we thought W. Bush was the most terrible President ever?  And an argument can still be made.  He got us into the 20 year $2 Trillion nation-building nightmare in Afghanistan and invaded Iraq on false pretenses (creating our own Teutoberg Forest/Quintus Varus moment) all without paying for those military/imperialistic misadventures, and added the Medicare drug coverage also without paying for it.  Pre-COVID, W. Bush was responsible for about 2/3s of the national debt as I recall.    But at least he didn't send a mob to the Capitol to try to stay in power.",phreeeman,2023-01-10T10:43:20,2
