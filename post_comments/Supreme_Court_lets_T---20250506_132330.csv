Oh no banning a condition that generally makes you undeployable because you need constant care no matter the *stage* you are in.  I support your decision but life is about sacrifices and consequences. You can't expect the world to just bend reality for you. Join then transition when you're out if you really want both experiences but don't expect to be welcomed when you try to transition in service and basically destroy your deployability for 2-3 years.,Katzchen12,2025-05-06T19:26:37,16
