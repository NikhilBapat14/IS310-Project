Tariffs should be the number one issue for Democrats, in driving the point home that it's not ""just Trump being rogue"", the entire GOP is behind this disaster.

Heck, Trump won't even run for re-election again (unless we're in a full-on coup scenario, but then public opinion won't matter, at all.) When the ship finally sinks and all the rats start fleeing, we must not let them just point the finger at Trump and blame him for everything. **They are fully complicit.**",GeneReddit123,2025-05-01T04:43:41,225

Prepare for a massive crash like 2008 or worse.  Prepare your finances.  Save as much money as you can because you will likely lose your job.

And don't forget the mom spends a higher rate of her paycheck the same day or month on necessities (read: 100%, and possibly more through debt) than the rich do, who place a lot of their money into investments, real estate, or spend it overseas, avoiding tariffs for much of their spending. Tariffs are not even an equal tax, they are a *regressive tax.*  Which is of course why conservatives love it. It's FairTax 2.0 (a decade-old proposal to replace all income taxes with a flat 25% sales tax), but this time with tariffs instead of sales taxes (easier to politically sell, requires no congressional approval, and can frame as ""anti-foreign"" rather than ""anti-taxpayer"", despite the latter being equally true in both cases.)",GeneReddit123,2025-05-01T06:53:04,27

">They’re not going to instill martial law  Why not? They have the support from conservatives across the nation. All because they're selling it as a removal of ""the illegals"". Look, Trump was right when he tanked Biden's bipartisan immigration bill so he could campaign on it. He's tapped into the latent racism of conservatives across the nation and his ""they're eating the dogs and cats"" line got him elected. He took advantage of the right's number one scapegoat and rode it all the way to the oval office again. There's a reason every election Fox News rolls out their ""caravans of immigrants"" story. Because it works.  So all these power grabs they're doing leans heavily on immigration because they know it sells well with conservatives. Roughly 45% of the nation (with the other large % being liberals and then some moderates in there somewhere filling the gap). Torture? That's an immigrant problem. Random removal without a warrant? Deportation? Shredding of the constitution and the rule of law? That's necessary because of the immigrant problem as they say. They're willing to accept anything that targets ""the bad people"".  Tariffs? Those are okay because of the scary foreign people. Death camp in El Salvador? That's okay because it's for scary foreign people. American tanks rolling through sanctuary cities? That's okay because it's for scary foreign people. Black-bagging people off the street by plain clothes masked officers into unmarked vans and disappeared of the face of the planet? That's okay because it's for scary foreign people.  Martial law is also mentioned as necessary in Project 2025 which Trump has been following to the letter. Sorry but martial law is coming.

They're convinced that ""just voting for the other party"" would have kept the very obvious and dangerous facist movement - that has been growing in their country for a long time -- at bay.

"You're more optimistic than I am. What I see is that Trump is the central pillar to this entire operation and when he finally kicks the bucket it all falls apart and the infighting begins within the GOP as it fractures. Right now they are unified under Trump.  So they don't have time for a slow burn. They have all the power they need to get started and they would be fools to give it up because they've afforded themselves total immunity as long as they control all 3 branches. Their time to convert the US into an irreversible dictatorship is limited. They need to remove all avenues of accountability to the public ASAP. I do not believe Trump is in good health.  The rhetoric of the first 100 days was one of urgency. Fox News was telling people it was because, apparently, the US was on the brink of collapse due to Biden. But that's so transparent only his base was convinced. Instead what I believe is the urgency comes from Trump's failing health.  So my assertion, flawed as it may be, is martial law at midterms and as many power grabs as they can until then. They must secure total authority and quickly. ""The eradication of the left"" is what they need. Once that's done there's nobody left to stand in their way of the wealth transfer you mention. They don't need a slow burn for this.

"I don't think we can reasonably predict what would have happened, or if there was rigging or whatever; but the reality is that even if Kamala had gotten in, which honestly wouldn't have even been a *good* thing even if it's miles away better than the current state of the US, all you'd be doing is kicking the can down the road.  The Nazis wouldn't go away, maybe as you say they'd be even more emboldened. The propaganda wouldn't cease, nor would the harm being done to vulnerable people, it would just be happening more slowly and in a non-official capacity.   You can't solve America's problems by ""just voting for the right person"" every time, but that's the only lens people are willing to see the problem through; because the alternative is terrifying, almost chaotic to consider. You solve America's problems by *getting rid of the ideologies and systems causing those problems in the first place*. You can't do that by just legislating it away and hoping the state enforces it away with increasingly authoritarian laws as the state and anti-state ideologies run deeper and deeper into an arms race grappling over power, the way you solve it is much more grassroots and much more fucking difficult; it requires the active and uncomfortable effort of every member of American society.  People have been cowed for years, and not just America but all over the world, and told that ""rocking the boat"" is gauche and not the thing to do, but if you don't rock the boat, if you don't nip fascist ideologies in the bud when they're small, if you don't meet fascist violence with defensive violence and fascist rhetoric with harsh consequences, then it'll happily grow in the ""free market of ideas"" space you've conveniently created for it.   Incrementalism will always be crushed and overrun by ideologies for whom increments are meaningless. Our societies have become so placid and wedded to the idea that ""Incrementalism is the only way, only the law can protect us from danger"" through years of propaganda and laziness that they idea of going *outside* of those borders, as fascists always will, is completely unthinkable and inconceivable, so when it does happen people are just blindsided and default to ""should have voted harder"" instead of ""you know, maybe voting isn't enough"".",RockinOneThreeTwo,2025-05-01T12:25:43,-3

"Disagree with this framing completely.  Biden's insistence on clinging to power when he was clearly unfit, directly going against the mandate he had coming out of the 2020 election, makes him another arsonist. A little-league arsonist compared to Trump, sure. But an arsonist nonetheless. The way we Dems are coddling him about this is just...embarassing.  Were you aware that he also actively meddled in Harris's campaign, telling her what she could and could not message on? Insisting she glaze him up at all points and never concede there's anything wrong with the economy? He prioritized his vain obsession with protecting his legacy over winning the election in a must-win election. Despite all the party talk about how we had to go all-out to beat Trump, our leaders clearly didn't believe that. And she didn't have the courage or political sense to stand up to him on any of it, which is also a damning indictment of Harris.  That man can burn.
