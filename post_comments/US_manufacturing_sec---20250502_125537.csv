It's hard to believe this stock market. Does Wall Street not recognize what's going on?,TSHRED56,2025-05-02T12:59:06,12
"Wait, you're telling me that having no system or plan to improve American manufacturing before destroying our global trade capabilities has resulted in existing American manufacturing start to fail?  If only every economist in the world could have told Trump that this was a bad idea.",07ShadowGuard,2025-05-02T13:18:25,13

"Wait till the tariffs resume after the tangerine toddler paused them, it will take another few weeks for the tariffs to be felt then people will buy less and as a result people will be fired production will slow down because their products are not being purchased and in some cases manufacturers will go out of business.",CAM6913,2025-05-02T18:37:42,2

"Price action is less based on the underlying and more so in response, or the prediction, to what other traders are doing.",krozarEQ,2025-05-02T13:07:55,9
"The other problem is that the market is about predictions. I think a lot of people out there still believe that Trump is going to make a great deal with China or at least that he’ll back down before too much damage is done.  Another part is that, to be frank, these aren’t really American companies in anything, but name. Apple has factories all over the world and sells their product all over the world. Google and Meta barely recognize national borders. If things get real bad maybe they’ll reincorporate in another country, but for now it’s enough that they are more integrated into the global economy than the American one.",SyntheticSlime,2025-05-03T06:37:22,2
