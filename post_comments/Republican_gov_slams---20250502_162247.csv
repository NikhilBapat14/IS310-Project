"I am Jewish. This is not antisemitic. People have a right to protest Israel and ask for ceasefires and arms embargo. If they were asking to kill all Jews, okay then we have a problem. If we're asking to put them in camps, or saying they are the destroyer of the world strictly because they are Jewish and not because of the actions they are taking in Israel, okay a problem.   This is the boy who cried wolf and it's dangerous for real antisemitic actions.",Fairymask,2025-05-02T16:59:04,9
">A city in Texas could lose its state funding over a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and an arms embargo against Israel. Republican Gov. [Greg Abbott](https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/greg-abbott) wrote a letter to San Marcos Mayor Jane Hughson admonishing the City Council, which voted to bring the resolution to a formal vote on May 6.  >[In his letter](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Letter_to_San_Marcos_04.29.25.pdf), Abbott pointed out that while the council was considering a resolution for a ""permanent ceasefire in occupied Palestine,"" it had not done the same to condemn Hamas following the Oct. 7 massacre.  modern Texas GOP love meddling in local affairs yet cry about Federal overreach. Texas was originally founded and set up to be more local control, less state control which is why Texas has the most counties by far and the Leg only meets every 2 years. This goes against Texas' spirit.",Opening_Track_1227,2025-05-02T16:29:16,6
"The antisemitism accusations towards universities, protestors, and state/local governments is all a sham justification to violate their rights.",friendsafariguy11,2025-05-02T19:21:02,3
"Even if it was antisemtic, this is a clear 1st amendment issue and the governor can't punish them for speech.",mces97,2025-05-02T17:27:48,2
Well that is true as well. Look at MTG and Musk. They are always saying antisemitic things and nothing happens.,Fairymask,2025-05-02T17:32:03,3
